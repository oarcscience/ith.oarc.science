<span id="iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Homily VI.</span>

<span id="iv.ix-p2"></span><span id="iv.ix-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iv.ix-p2.2"></span>1 John III. 19</span>–4. 3

<span id="iv.ix-p3"></span>“And herein we know that we are of the truth,
and assure our hearts before Him. For if our heart think ill of us, God
is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart
think not ill of us, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever
we ask, we shall receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and
do in His sight those things that please Him. And this is His
commandment, That we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ,
and love one another, as He gave us commandment. And he that keepeth His
commandments shall dwell in Him, and He in him. And herein we know that
He abideth in us, by the Holy Spirit which He hath given us. Dearly
beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are
of God: because many false prophets are gone out into this world. In
this is known the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit that confesseth
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is
the antichrist, of whom ye have heard that he should come; and even now
already is he in this world.”

<span id="iv.ix-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.ix-p4.1"></span>If</span> ye remember, brethren, yesterday we
closed our sermon at this sentence, <span
id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284.md) which without doubt behooved and
does behoove to abide in your heart, seeing it was the last ye heard.
“My little children, let us not love only in word and in tongue; but in
deed and in truth.” Then he goes on: “And herein we know that we are of
the truth, and assure our hearts before Him.” <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) “For if our heart <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) think ill of us, God is greater
than our heart, and knoweth all things.” He had said, “Let us not love
only in word and in tongue, but in work and in truth:” we are asked, In
what work, or in what truth, is he known that loveth God, or loveth his
brother? Above he had said up to what point charity is perfected: what
the Lord saith in the Gospel, “Greater love than this hath no man, that
one lay down his life for his friends,” <span
id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) this same had the apostle also
said: “As He laid down His life for us, we ought also to lay down our
lives for the brethren.” <span id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) This
is the perfection of charity, and greater can not at all be found. But
because it is not perfect in all, and that man ought not to despair in
whom it is not perfect, if that be already born which may be perfected:
and of course if born, it must be nourished, and by certain nourishments
of its own must be brought unto its proper perfection: therefore, we
have asked concerning the commencement of charity, where it begins, and
there have straightway found: “But whoso hath this world’s goods, and
seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion
from him, how dwelleth the love of the Father in him?” <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) Here then hath this charity, my
brethren, its beginning: to give of one’s superfluities to him that hath
need to him that is in any distress; of one’s temporal abundance to
deliver his brother from temporal tribulation. Here is the first rise of
charity. This, being thus begun, if thou shalt nourish with the word of
God and hope of the life to come, thou wilt come at last unto that
perfection, that thou shalt be ready to lay down thy life for thy
brethren.

<span id="iv.ix-p11"></span>2. But, because many such things are done by
men who seek other objects, and who love not the brethren; let us come
back to the tes <span id="page_494">p. 494</span> <span
id="iv.ix-Page_494"></span>timony of conscience. How do we prove that
many such things are done by men who love not the brethren? How many in
heresies and schisms call themselves martyrs! They seem to themselves to
lay down their lives for their brethren. If for the brethren they laid
down their lives, they would not separate themselves from the whole
brotherhood. Again, how many there are who for the sake of vainglory
bestow much, give much, and seek therein but the praise of men and
popular glory, which is full of windiness, and possesses no stability!
Seeing, then, there are such, where shall be the proof of brotherly
charity? Seeing he wished it to be proved, and hath said by way of
admonition, “My little children, let us not love only in word and in
tongue; but in deed and in truth;” we ask, in what work, in what truth?
Can there be a more manifest work than to give to the poor? Many do this
of vainglory, not of love. Can there be a greater work than to die for
the brethren? This also, many would fain be thought to do, who do it of
vainglory to get a name, not from bowels of love. It remains, that that
man loves his brother, who before God, where God alone seeth, assures
his own heart, and questions his heart whether he does this indeed for
love of the brethren; and his witness is that eye which penetrates the
heart, where man cannot look. Therefore Paul the Apostle, because he was
ready to die for the brethren, and said, “I will myself be spent for
your souls,” <span id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) yet, because God
only saw this in his heart, not the mortal men to whom he spake, he
saith to them, “But to me it is a very small thing that I should be
judged of you or at man’s bar.” <span
id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md) And the same apostle shows also in
a certain place, that these things are oft done of empty vainglory, not
upon the solid ground of love: for speaking of the praises of charity he
saith, “If I distribute all my goods to the poor, and if I deliver up my
body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.” <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) Is it possible for a man to do this
without charity? It is. For they that have divided unity, are persons
that have not charity. Seek there, and ye shall see many giving much to
the poor; shall see others prepared to welcome death, insomuch that
where there is no persecutor they cast themselves headlong: these
doubtless without charity do this. Let us come back then to conscience,
of which the apostle saith: “For our glorying is this, the testimony of
our conscience.”  <span id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md) Let us come
back to conscience, of which the same saith, “But let each prove his own
work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in
another.” <span id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) Therefore, let each
one of us “prove his own work,” whether it flow forth from the vein of
charity, whether it be from charity as the root that his good works
sprout forth as branches. “But let each prove his own work, and then he
shall have glorying in himself and not in another,” not when another’s
tongue bears witness to him, but when his own conscience bears it.

<span id="iv.ix-p17"></span>3. This it is then that he enforces here.
“In this we know that we are of the truth, when in deed and in truth” we
love, “not only in words and in tongue: and <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md) assure our heart before Him.” <span
id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) What meaneth, “before Him?” Where
He seeth. Whence the Lord Himself in the Gospel saith: “Take heed that
ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: otherwise
ye have no reward with your Father which is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) And what meaneth, “Let not thy left
hand know what thy right hand doeth:” except that the right hand means a
pure conscience, the left hand the lust of the world? <span
id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) Many through lust of the world do
many wonderful things: the left hand worketh, not the right. The right
hand ought to work, and without knowledge of the left hand, so that lust
of the world may not even mix itself therewith when by love we work
aught that is good. And where do we get to know this? Thou art before
God: question thine heart, see what thou hast done, and what therein was
thine aim; thy salvation, or the windy praise of men. Look within, for
man cannot judge whom he cannot see. If “we assure our heart,” let it be
“before Him.” Because “if our heart think ill of us,” *i.e.* accuse us
within, that we do not the thing with that mind it ought to be done
withal, “greater is God than our heart, and knoweth all things.” Thou
hidest thine heart from man: hide it from God if thou canst! How shalt
thou hide it from Him, to whom it is said by a sinner, fearing and
confessing, “Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit? and from Thy face
whither shall I flee?” <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) He
sought a way to flee, to escape the judgment of God, and found none. For
where is God not? “If I shall ascend,” saith he, “into heaven, Thou art
there: if I shall descend <span id="page_495">p. 495</span> <span
id="iv.ix-Page_495"></span>into hell, Thou art there.” Whither wilt thou
go? whither wilt thou flee? Wilt thou hear counsel? If thou wouldest
flee from Him, flee to Him. Flee to Him by confessing, not from Him by
hiding: hide thou canst not, but confess thou canst. Say unto Him, “Thou
art my place to flee unto;” <span id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md)
and let love be nourished in thee, which alone leadeth unto life. Let
thy conscience bear thee witness that thy love is of God. If it be of
God, do not wish to display it before men; because neither men’s praises
lift thee unto heaven, nor their censures put thee down from thence. Let
Him see, who crowneth thee: be He thy witness, by whom as judge thou art
crowned. “Greater is God than our heart, and knoweth all things.”

<span id="iv.ix-p24"></span>4. “Beloved, if our heart think not ill of
us, we have confidence towards God:” <span
id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) —What meaneth, “If our heart think
not ill”? If it make true answer to us, that we love and that there
is <span id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) genuine love in us: not
feigned but sincere; seeking a brother’s salvation, expecting no
emolument from a brother, but only his salvation—“we have confidence
toward God: and whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him, because we
keep His commandments.” <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md)
—Therefore, not in the sight of men, but where God Himself seeth, in the
heart—“we have confidence,” then, “towards God: and whatsoever we ask,
we shall receive of Him:” howbeit, because we keep His commandments.
What are “His commandments”? Must we be always repeating? “A new
commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.” <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) It is charity itself that he speaks
of, it is this that he enforces. Whoso then shall have brotherly
charity, and have it before God, where God seeth, and his heart being
interrogated under righteous examination make him none other answer than
that the genuine root of charity is there for good fruits to come from;
that man hath confidence with God, and whatsoever he shall ask, he shall
receive of Him, because he keepeth His commandments.

<span id="iv.ix-p29"></span>5. Here a question meets us: for it is not
this or that man, or thou or I that come in question,—for if I have
asked any thing of God and receive it not, any person may easily say of
me, “He hath not charity:” and of any man soever of this present time,
this may easily be said; and let any think what he will, a man of
man:—not we, but those come more in question, those men of whom it is on
all hands known that they were saints when they wrote, and that they are
now with God. Where is the man that hath charity, if Paul had it not,
who said, “Our mouth is open unto you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is
enlarged; ye are not straitened in us:” <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) who said, “I will myself be spent
for your souls:” and so great grace was in him, that it was manifested
that he had charity. And yet we find that he asked and did not receive.
What say we, brethren? It is a question: look attentively to God: it is
a great question, this also. Just as, where it was said of sin, “He that
is born of God sinneth not:” we found this sin to be the violating of
charity, and that this was the thing strictly intended in that place: so
too we ask now what it is that he would say. For if thou look but to the
words, it seems plain: if thou take the examples into the account, it is
obscure. Than the words here nothing can be plainer. “And whatsoever we
ask, we shall receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do
those things that are pleasing in His sight.” “Whatsoever we ask,” saith
he, “we shall receive of Him.” He hath put us sorely to straits. In the
other place also he would put us to straits, if he meant all sin: but
then we found room to expound it in this, that he meant it of a certain
sin, not of all sin; howbeit of a sin which “whosoever is born of God
committeth not:” and we found that this same sin is none other than the
violation of charity. We have also a manifest example from the Gospel,
when the Lord saith, “If I had not come, they had not had sin.” <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306.md) How? Were the Jews innocent when He
came to them, because He so speaks? Then if He had not come, would they
have had no sin? Then did the Physician’s presence make one sick, not
take away the fever? What madman even would say this? He came not but to
cure and heal the sick. Therefore when He said, “If I had not come, they
had not had sin,” what would He have to be understood, but a certain sin
in particular? For there was a sin which the Jews would not have had.
What sin? That they believed not on Him, that when he had come they
despised Him. As then He there said “sin,” and it does not follow that
we are to understand all sin, but a certain sin: so here also not all
sin, lest it be contrary to that place where he saith, “If we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us:” <span
id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md) but a certain sin in particular,
that is, the violation of charity. But in this place he hath bound us
more tightly: “If we shall ask,” he hath said, “if our heart accuse us
not, and tell us in answer, in the sight of God, that true love is in
us;” “Whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him.”

<span id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span id="iv.ix-Page_496"></span>

<span id="iv.ix-p33"></span>6. Well now: I have already told you, my,
beloved brethren, let no man turn toward us. For what are we? or what
are ye? What, but the Church of God which is known to all? And, if it
please Him, in that Church are we; and those of us who by love abide in
it, there let us persevere, if we would show the love we have. But then
the apostle Paul, what evil are we to think of him? He not love the
brethren! He not have within himself the testimony of his conscience in
the sight of God! Paul not have within him that root of charity whence
all good fruits proceeded! What madman would say this? Well then: where
find we that the apostle asked and did not receive? He saith himself:
“Lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the
revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of
Satan to buffet me. For which thing I besought the Lord thrice, that He
would take it from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for
thee: for strength is made perfect in weakness.” <span
id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308.md) Lo, he was not heard in his prayer
that the “angel of Satan” should be taken from him. But wherefore?
Because it was not good for him. He was heard, then, for salvation, when
he was not heard according to his wish. Know, my beloved, a great <span
id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) mystery: which we urge upon your
consideration on purpose that it may not slip from you in your
temptations. The saints are in all things heard unto salvation: they are
always heard in that which respects their eternal salvation; it is this
that they desire: because in regard of this, their prayers are always
heard.

<span id="iv.ix-p36"></span>7. But let us distinguish God’s different
ways of hearing prayer. For we find some not heard for their wish, heard
for salvation: and again some we find heard for their wish, not heard
for salvation. Mark this difference, hold fast this example of a man not
heard for his wish but heard for salvation. Hear the apostle Paul; for
what is the hearing of prayer unto salvation, God Himself showed him:
“Sufficient for thee,” saith He, “is my grace; for strength is perfected
in weakness.” Thou hast besought, hast cried, hast thrice cried: the
very cry thou didst raise once for all I heard, I turned not away mine
ears from thee; I know what I should do: thou wouldest have it taken
away, the healing thing by which thou art burned; I know the infirmity
by which thou art burdened. Well then: here is a man who was heard for
salvation, while as to his will he was not heard. Where find we persons
heard for their will, not heard for salvation? Do we find, think we,
some wicked, some impious man, heard of God for his will, not heard for
salvation? If I put to you the instance of some man, perchance thou wilt
say to me, “It is thou that callest him wicked, for he was righteous;
had he not been righteous, his prayer would not have been heard by God.”
The instance I am about to allege is of one, of whose iniquity and
impiety none can doubt. The devil himself: he asked for Job, and
received.  <span id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) Have ye not here
also heard concerning the devil, that “he that committeth sin is of the
devil”? <span id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md) Not that the devil
created, but that the sinner imitates. Is it not said of him, “He stood
not in the truth”? <span id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312.md) Is not
even he “that old serpent,” who, through the woman pledged the first man
in the drink of poison? <span id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313.md) Who
even in the case of Job, kept for him his wife, that by her the husband
might be, not comforted, but tempted? The devil asked for a holy man, to
tempt him; and he received: the apostle asked that the thorn in the
flesh might be taken from him, and he received not. But the apostle was
more heard than the devil. For the apostle was heard for salvation,
though not for his wish: the devil was heard for his wish, but for
damnation. For that Job was yielded up to him to be tempted, was in
order that by his standing the proof the devil should be tormented. But
this, my brethren, we find not only in the Old Testament books, but also
in the Gospel. The demons besought the Lord, when He expelled them from
the man, that they might be permitted to go into the swine. Should the
Lord not have power to tell them not to approach even those creatures?
For, had it not been His will to permit this, they were not about to
rebel against the King of heaven and earth. But with a view to a certain
mystery, with a certain <span id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md)
ulterior meaning, He let the demons go into the swine: to show that the
devil hath dominion in them that lead the life of swine. <span
id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315.md) Demons then were heard in their
request; was the apostle not heard? Or rather (what is truer) shall we
say, The apostle was heard, the demons not heard? Their will was
effected; his weal was perfected.

<span id="iv.ix-p43"></span>8. Agreeably with this, we ought to
understand that God, though He give not to our will, doth give for our
salvation. For sup <span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="iv.ix-Page_497"></span>pose the thing thou have asked be to thine
hurt, and the Physician knows that it is to thine hurt; what then? It is
not to be said that the physician does not give ear to thee, when,
perhaps, thou askest for cold water, and if it is good for thee, he
gives it immediately, if not good, he gives it not. Had he no ears for
thy request, or rather, did he give ear for thy weal, even when he
gainsaid thy will? Then let there be in you charity, my brethren; let it
be in you, and then set your minds at rest: even when the thing ye ask
for is not given you, your prayer is granted, only, ye know it not. Many
have been given into their own hands, to their own hurt: of whom the
apostle saith, “God gave them up to their own hearts’ lusts.” <span
id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316.md) Some man hath asked for a great sum
of money; he hath received, to his hurt. When he had it not, he had
little to fear; no sooner did he come to have it, than he became a prey
to the more powerful. Was not that man’s request granted to his own
hurt, who would needs have that for which he should be sought after by
the robber, whereas, being poor, none sought after him? Learn to beseech
God that ye may commit it to the Physician to do what He knows best. Do
thou confess the disease, let Him apply the means of healing. Do thou
only hold fast charity. For He will needs cut, will needs burn; what if
thou criest out, and art not spared for thy crying under the cutting,
under the burning and the tribulation, yet He knows how far the
rottenness reaches. <span id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) Thou
wouldest have Him even now take off His hands, and He considers only the
deepness of the sore; He knows how far to go. He does not attend to thee
for thy will, but he does attend to thee for thy healing. Be ye sure,
then, my brethren, that what the apostle saith is true: “For we know not
what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered: for He
maketh intercession for the saints.”  <span
id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md) How is it said, “The Spirit itself
intercedeth for the saints,” but as meaning the charity which is wrought
in thee by the Spirit? For therefore saith the same apostle: “The
charity of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is
given unto us.” <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) It is charity
that groans, it is charity that prays: against it He who gave it cannot
shut His ears. Set your minds at rest: let charity ask, and the ears of
God are there. Not that which thou wishest is done, but that is done
which is advantageous. Therefore, “whatever we ask,” saith he, “we shall
receive of Him,” I have already said, If thou understand it to mean,
“for salvation,” there is no question: if not for salvation, there is a
question, and a great one, a question that makes thee an accuser of the
apostle Paul. “Whatever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His
commandments, and do these things that are pleasing in His sight:”
within, where He seeth.

<span id="iv.ix-p48"></span>9. And what are those commandments? “This,”
saith he, “is His commandment, That we should believe on the name of His
Son Jesus Christ, and love one another.” <span
id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md) Ye see that this is the
commandment: ye see that whoso doeth aught against this commandment,
doeth the sin from which “every one that is born of God” is free. “As He
gave us commandment:” that we love one another. “And he that keepeth His
commandment” <span id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) —ye see that
none other thing is bidden us than that we love one another—“And he that
keepeth His commandment shall abide <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) in Him, and He in him.” “And in
this we know that He abideth in us, by the Spirit which He hath given
us. Is it not manifest that this is what the Holy Ghost works in man,
that there should be in him love and charity? Is it not manifest, as the
Apostle Paul saith, that “the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
by the Holy Ghost which is given us”? <span
id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) For \[our apostle\] was speaking of
charity, and was saying that we ought in the sight of God to interrogate
our own heart. “But if our heart think not ill of us:” *i.e.* if it
confess that from the love of our brother is done in us whatever is done
in any good work. And then besides, in speaking of the commandment, he
says this: “This is His commandment, That we should believe on the name
of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as He gave us
commandment.” “And he that doeth His commandment abideth <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) in Him, and He in him. In this we
know that He abideth in us, by the Spirit which He hath given us.” <span
id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) If in truth thou find that thou
hast charity, thou hast the Spirit of God in order to understand: for a
very necessary thing it is.

<span id="iv.ix-p55"></span>10. In the earliest times, “the Holy Ghost
fell upon them that believed: and they spake with tongues,” which they
had not learned, “as the Spirit gave them utterance.” <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) These were signs adapted to the
time. For there behooved to be that betokening of the Holy Spirit in all
tongues, to shew that the Gospel of God was to run through all tongues
over <span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="iv.ix-Page_498"></span>the whole earth. That thing was done for a
betokening, and it passed away. In the laying on of hands now, that
persons may receive the Holy Ghost, do we look that they should speak
with tongues? Or when we laid the hand on these infants,  <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) did each one of you look to see
whether they would speak with tongues, and, when he saw that they did
not speak with tongues, was any of you so wrong-minded as to say, These
have not received the Holy Ghost; for, had they received, they would
speak with tongues as was the case in those times? If then the witness
of the presence of the Holy Ghost be not now given through these
miracles, by what is it given, by what does one get to know that he has
received the Holy Ghost? Let him question his own heart. If he love his
brother the Spirit of God dwelleth in him. Let him see, let him prove
himself before the eyes of God, let him see whether there be in him the
love of peace and unity, the love of the Church that is spread over the
whole earth. Let him not rest only in his loving the brother whom he has
before his eyes, for we have many brethren whom we do not see, and in
the unity of the Spirit we are joined to them. What marvel that they are
not with us? We are in one body, we have one Head, in heaven. Brethren,
our two eyes do not see each other; as one may say, they do not know
each other. But in the charity of the bodily frame do they not know each
other? For, to shew you that in the charity which knits them together
they do know each other; when both eyes are open, the right may not rest
on some object, on which the left shall not rest likewise. Direct the
glance of the right eye without the other, if thou canst. Together they
meet in one object, together they are directed to one object: their aim
is one, their places diverse. If then all who with thee love God have
one aim with thee, heed not that in the body thou are separated in
place; the eyesight of the heart ye have alike fixed on the light of
truth. Then if thou wouldest know that thou hast received the Spirit,
question thine heart: lest haply thou have the sacrament, and have not
the virtue of the sacrament. Question thine heart. If love of thy
brethren be there, set thy mind at rest. There cannot be love without
the Spirit of God: since Paul cries, “The love of God is shed abroad in
your hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.” <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md)

<span id="iv.ix-p59"></span>11. “Beloved, believe not every
spirit.” <span id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) Because he had said,
“In this we know that He abideth in us, by the Spirit which He hath
given us.” But how this same Spirit is known, mark this: “Beloved,
believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they be from
God.” And who is he that proves the spirits? A hard matter has he put to
us, my brethren! It is well for us that he should tell us himself how we
are to discern them. He is about to tell us: fear not: but first see;
mark: see that hereby is expressed the very thing that vain
heretics <span id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) taunt us withal.
Mark, see what he says, “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove
the spirits whether they be from God.” The Holy Spirit is spoken of in
the Gospel by the name of water; where the Lord “cried and said, If any
man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me,
out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) But the evangelist has expounded of
what He said this: for he goes on to say, “But this spake He of the
Spirit, which they that believed on Him should receive.” Wherefore did
not the Lord baptize many? But what saith he? “For the Holy Ghost was
not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.” Then seeing
those had baptism, and had not yet received the Holy Ghost, whom on the
day of Pentecost the Lord sent from heaven, the glorifying of the Lord
was first waited for, so that the Spirit might be given. Even before He
was glorified, and before He sent the Spirit, He yet invited men to
prepare themselves for the receiving of the water of which He said,
“Whoso thirsteth, let him come and drink;” and, “He that believeth on
me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” What meaneth,
“Rivers of living water”? What is that water? Let no man ask me; ask the
Gospel. “But this,” saith it, “He said of the Spirit, which they should
receive that should believe on Him.” Consequently, the water of the
sacrament is one thing: another, the water which betokens the Spirit of
God. The water of the sacrament is visible: the water of the Spirit
invisible. *That* washes the body, and betokens that which is done in
the soul. By *this* Spirit the soul itself is cleansed and fed. This is
the Spirit of God, which heretics and all that cut themselves off from
the Church, cannot have. And whosoever do not openly cut themselves off,
but by iniquity are cut off, and being within, whirl about as chaff and
are not grain; these have not this Spirit. This Spirit is denoted by the
Lord under the name of water: and we have heard from this epistle,
“Believe not every spirit;” and those words of Solomon <span
id="page_499">p. 499</span> <span id="iv.ix-Page_499"></span>bear
witness, “From strange water keep thee far.” <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332.md) What meaneth, “water”? Spirit. Does
water always signify spirit? Not always: but in some places it signifies
the Spirit, in some places it signifies baptism, in some places
signifies peoples, <span id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) in some
places signifies counsel: thus thou findest it said in a certain place,
“Counsel is a fountain of life to them that possess it.” <span
id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) So then, in divers places of the
Scriptures, the term “water” signifies divers things. Now however by the
term water ye have heard the Holy Spirit spoken of, not by an
interpretation of ours but by witness of the Gospel, where it saith,
“But this said He of the Spirit, which they should receive that should
believe on Him.” If then by the name of water is signified the Holy
Spirit, and this epistle saith to us, “Believe not every spirit, but
prove the spirits, whether they be of God;” let us understand that of
this it is said, “From strange water keep thee far, and from a strange
fountain drink thou not.” <span id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md)
What meaneth, “From a strange fountain drink thou not”? A strange spirit
believe thou not.

<span id="iv.ix-p67"></span>12. There remains then the test by which it
is to be proved to be the Spirit of God. He has indeed set down a sign,
and this, belike, difficult: let us see, however. We are to recur to
that charity; it is that which teacheth us, because it is the unction.
However, what saith he here? “Prove the spirits, whether they be from
God: because many false prophets have gone out into this world.” Now
there are all heretics and all schismatics. How then am I to prove the
spirit? He goes on: “In this is known <span
id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) the Spirit of God.” Wake up the
ears of your heart. We were at a loss; we were saying, Who knows? who
discerns? Behold, he is about to tell the sign. “Hereby is known the
Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh is of God: and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is the antichrist,
of whom ye have heard that he should come; and even now already is he in
this world.”  <span id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337.md) Our ears, so to
say, are on the alert for discerning of the spirits; and we have been
told something, such that thereby we discern not a whit the more. For
what saith he? “Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ came in
the flesh, is of God.” Then is the spirit that is among the heretics, of
God, seeing they “confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh”? Aye,
here perchance they lift themselves up against us, and say: Ye have not
the Spirit from God; but we confess “that Jesus Christ came in the
flesh:” but the apostle here hath said that those have not the Spirit of
God, who confess not “that Jesus Christ came in the flesh.” Ask the
Arians: they confess “that Jesus Christ came in the flesh:” ask the
Eunomians; they confess “that Jesus Christ came in the flesh:” ask the
Macedonians; they confess “that Jesus Christ came in the flesh:” put the
question to the Cataphryges; they confess “that Jesus Christ came in the
flesh:” put it to the Novatians; they confess “that Jesus Christ came in
the flesh.” Then have all these heresies the Spirit of God? Are they
then no false prophets? Is there then no deception there, no seduction
there? Assuredly they are antichrists; for “they went out from us, but
were not of us.”

<span id="iv.ix-p70"></span>13. What are we to do then? By what to
discern them? Be very attentive; let us go together in heart, and knock.
Charity herself keeps watch; for it is none other than she that shall
knock, she also that shall open: anon ye shall understand in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ. Already ye have heard that it was said above,
“Whoso denieth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, the same is an
antichrist.” There also we asked, Who denies? because neither do we
deny, nor do those deny. And we found that some do in their deeds
deny; <span id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) and we brought
testimony from the apostle, who saith, “For they confess that they know
God, but in their deeds deny Him.” <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) Thus then let us now also make the
enquiry in the deeds not in the tongue. What is the spirit that is not
from God? That “which denieth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.”
And what is the spirit that is from God? That “which confesseth that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.” Who is he that confesseth that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh? Now, brethren, to the mark! let us look to
the works, not stop at the noise of the tongue. Let us ask *why* Christ
came in the flesh, so we get at the persons who deny that He is come in
the flesh. If thou stop at tongues, why, thou shalt hear many a heresy
confessing that Christ is come in the flesh: but the truth convicteth
those men. Wherefore came Christ in the flesh? Was He not God? Is it not
written of Him, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God?” <span id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md)
Was it not He that did feed angels, is it not He that doth feed <span
id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span id="iv.ix-Page_500"></span>angels? Did
He not in such sort come hither, that He departed not thence? Did He not
in such sort ascend, that He forsook not us? Wherefore then came He in
the flesh? Because it behooved us to have the hope of resurrection shown
unto us. God He was, and in flesh He came; for God could not die, flesh
could die; He came then in the flesh, that He might die for us. But how
died He for us? “Greater charity than this hath no man, that a man lay
down his life for his friends.” <span
id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) Charity therefore brought Him to
the flesh. Whoever therefore has not charity denies that Christ is come
in the flesh. Here then do thou now question all heretics. Did Christ
come in the flesh? “He did come; this I believe, this I confess.” Nay,
this thou deniest. “How do I deny? Thou hearest that I say it!” Nay, I
convict thee of denying it. Thou sayest with the voice, deniest with the
heart; sayest in words, deniest in deeds. “How,” sayest thou, “do I deny
in deeds?” Because the end for which Christ came in the flesh, was, that
He might die for us. He died for us, because therein He taught much
charity. “Greater charity than this hath no man, that a man lay down his
life for his friends.” Thou hast not charity, seeing thou for thine own
honor dividest unity. Therefore by this understand ye the spirit that is
from God. Give the earthen vessels a tap, put them to the proof, whether
haply they be cracked and give a dull sound: see whether they ring full
and clear, see whether charity be there. Thou takest thyself away from
the unity of the whole earth, thou dividest the Church by schisms, thou
rendest the Body of Christ. He came in the flesh, to gather in one, thou
makest an outcry to scatter abroad. This then is the Spirit of God,
which saith that Jesus is come in the flesh, which saith, not in tongue
but in deeds, which saith, not by making a noise but by loving. And that
spirit is not of God, which denies that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh; denies, here also, not in tongue but in life; not in words but in
deeds. It is manifest therefore by what we may know the brethren. Many
within are in a sort within; but none without except he be indeed
without.

<span id="iv.ix-p75"></span>14. Nay, and that ye may know that he has
referred the matter to deeds, he saith, “And every spirit, *qui solvit
Christum*, which does away with Christ that He came in the flesh, <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) is not of God.” A doing away in
deeds is meant. What has he shown thee? “That denieth:” in that he
saith, “doeth away” (or, “unmaketh”). He came to gather in one, thou
comest to unmake. Thou wouldest pull Christ’s members asunder. How can
it be said that thou deniest not that Christ is come in the flesh, who
rendest assunder the Church of God which He hath gathered together?
Therefore thou goest against Christ; thou art an antichrist. Be thou
within, or be thou without, thou art an antichrist: only, when thou art
within, thou art hidden; when thou art without, thou art made manifest.
Thou unmakest Jesus and deniest that He came in the flesh; thou art not
of God. Therefore He saith in the Gospel: “Whoso shall break <span
id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) one of these least commandments,
and shall teach so, shall be called least in the kingdom of
heaven.” <span id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) What is this
breaking? What this teaching? A breaking in the deeds and a teaching as
it were in words. <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) “Thou that
preachest men should not steal, dost thou steal?” <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) Therefore he that steals breaks or
undoes the commandment in his deed, and as it were teaches so: “he shall
be called least in the kingdom of heaven,” *i.e.* in the Church of this
present <span id="page_501">p. 501</span> <span
id="iv.ix-Page_501"></span>time. <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) Of him it is said, “What they say
do ye; but what they do, that do not ye. <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) But he that shall do, and shall
teach so, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” From this,
that He has here said, *fecerit*, “shall do,” while in opposition to
this He has there said *solverit*, meaning *non fecerit*, “shall not do,
and shall teach so”—to break, then, is, not to do—what doth He teach us,
but that we should interrogate men’s deeds, not take their words upon
trust? The obscurity of the things compels us to speak much at length,
chiefly that that which the Lord deigns to reveal may be brought within
reach even of the brethren of slower understanding, because all were
bought by the blood of Christ. And I am afraid the epistle itself will
not be finished during these days as I promised: but as the Lord will,
it is better to reserve the remainder, than to overload your hearts with
too much food.

*Dimisit*, not *misit*: so, *Expulsa et in porcos permissa dæmonia*:
“the demons cast out from the man and allowed to go into the swine.”
*Quæst. Evang*. ii. 13. *Quod in porcas in montibus pascentes ire
permissa sunt*, &c. “That they were allowed to go into the swine feeding
upon the mountains, betokens unclean and proud men over whom through the
worship of idols the demons have dominion.”

<span id="iv.ix-p76"></span> *Qui solvit Christum in carne venisse*.
Edd. *Erasm. Lugd*. and *Ven.* omit *in carne venisse*, but the Louvain
editors attest that they are found in the <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.1"></span>mss.</span> of Augustin. <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.2"></span>Ed. Par.</span> (Bodl. <span class="c10"><span

them). *Infra*, Hom. vii. 2. *Omnis qui solvit J.C., et negat eum in
carne venisse*. The printed Vulg. has, *Omnis spiritus qui solvit
Christum ex Deo non est*. In Serm. 182 and 183, preached some time later
on this text, Aug. reads it, *Omnis sp. qui non confitetur* (and, *qui
negat) Jesum Christum in carne venisse*. S. Cypr. *Test. adv. Jud*. ii.
18, *qui autem negat in carne venisse, de Deo non est*. S. Iren. iii.
18, in the ancient Latin version, *Et omnis sp. qui solvit Jesum
Christum, non est ex Deo*. Tertull. *adv. Marcion*. v. 16, *præcursores
antichristi spiritus, negantes Christum in carne venisse et solventes
Jesum, sc. in Deo creatore*. *De jejun. adv.* Psych. 1, *non quod alium
Deum prædicent.…,nec quod Jesum Christum solvant. De carne Christi*, 24.
*Qui negat Christum in carne venisse, hic antichristus est*: where he
says, the apostle “by clearly marking one Christ, shakes those who argue
for a Christ multiform, making Christ one, Jesus another, &c.” Leo Ep.
x. 5<span id="iv.ix-p76.4"></span>. *ad Flavian*, seems to have read in
the Gr. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.5"></span>διαιροῦν</span>. Other Latin authorities for the
reading *qui solvit* are cited by Mill. *in loc*. Socrates H. E. vii.
32, affirms, that in the old <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.6"></span>mss.</span> the reading was <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix-p76.7"></span>πᾶν πνεῦμα ὃ λύει τὸν
’Ιησοῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ žστι</span>: adding, that the expression was
expunged from the old copies by those who would fain separate the
Godhead from the Man of the Incarnation, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.8"></span>οἰ χωρίζειν ἀπὸ τοῦ τῆς οἰκονομίας ἀνθρώπου
βουλόμενοι τὴν θεότητα</span>. (Valesius *in loc*. suggests that
Socrates may have read in his <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.9"></span>mss.</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.10"></span> ὃ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.11"></span>λύει τὸν ’Ιησοῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ
žστι</span>: Matthäi, that he wrote, ë <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.12"></span> μὴ ὁμολογεῖ, τούτεστιν, ὃ λύει</span>.) But no
extant <span class="c10"><span id="iv.ix-p76.13"></span>mss.</span>
acknowledge the reading: and the Greek Fathers headed by S. Polycarp *ad
Philipp*. sec. 7 (<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix-p76.14"></span>πᾶς
ὃς ἂν μὴ ὁμολογῇ ’Ι.Χ. ἐν σαρκἱ ἐληλυθέναι</span>,) bear witness to the
received text: only Cyril. *de recta Fide ad Reginas* being cited by
Mill for the reading <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix-p76.15"></span>
λύει</span>. This reading may (as Mill has suggested, comp. Grot. *in
loc*.) have originated in a marginal gloss, directed against the
Gnostics. Thus in a scholion edited by Matthäi it is said: “For the
precursors of Antichrist were the heresies, whose characteristic mark it
is by the means of false prophets and spirits <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ix-p76.16"></span>λύειν τὸν ’Ιησοῦν</span>, to unmake Jesus, by
not confessing that He is come in the flesh.”

(<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix-p79.1"></span>οὕτως</span> for
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix-p79.2"></span> οὖτος</span>) h.e.
*secundum id quod non solvit*. Here he takes *docuerit sic* in the sense
of teaching men by and agreeably with the practice of the teacher, which
is that of breaking the commandments: “whosoever shall break one of
these least commandments and in that way shall teach men,” *solverit et
secundum suam solutionem docuerit*. But *supra*, Hom. *in Ev.* cxxii. 9,
he seems to make it parallel with [Matt. xxiii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.ix-p79.3"></span>, “they
say and do not:” *qui docent bona loquendo quæ solvunt male vivendo*.
Comp. Serm. cclii. 3. His full meaning appears to be, that together with
the good teaching in words, there goes a sort of teaching (*quasi
docet*) not in words but in the deeds.
