<span id="iii.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.liv-p1.1"></span>Tractate LIII.</span>

<span id="iii.liv-p2"></span><span id="iii.liv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.liv-p2.2"></span>Chapter XII. 37–43</span>

<span id="iii.liv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.liv-p3.1"></span>When</span> our Lord Christ, foretelling His
own passion, and the fruitfulness of His death in being lifted up on the
cross, said that He would draw all \[things\] after Him; and when the
Jews, understanding that He spake of His death, put to Him the question
how He could speak of death as awaiting Him, when they heard out of the
law that Christ abideth for ever; He exhorted them, while still they had
in them the little light, which had so taught them that Christ was
eternal, to walk, to make themselves acquainted with the whole subject,
lest they should be overtaken with darkness. And, when He had said this,
He hid Himself from them. With these points you have been made
acquainted in former Lord’s day lessons and discourses.

<span id="iii.liv-p4"></span>2. The evangelist thereafter brings forward
what has formed the brief subject of to-day’s reading, and says, “But
though He had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not
on Him: that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which
he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of
the Lord been revealed?” Where he makes it sufficiently plain that the
Son of God is Himself the arm of the Lord; not that the person of God
the Father is determined by the shape of human flesh, and that the Son
is attached to Him as a member of His body; but because all things were
made by Him, and therefore He is designated the arm of the Lord. For as
it is with thine arm that thou workest, so the Word of God is styled His
arm; because by the Word He elaborated the world. For why does a man, in
order to do some work, stretch forth his arm, but because the doing of
it does not straightway follow his word? And if he was endowed with such
pre-eminent power that what he said was done without any movement of his
body, then would his word be his arm. But the Lord Jesus, the
only-begotten Son of God the Father, as He is no mere member of the
Father’s body, so is He no mere thinkable, and audible, and transitory
word; for, as all things were made by Him, He was the word of God.

<span id="iii.liv-p5"></span>3. When, therefore, we hear that the Son of
God is the arm of God the Father, let no carnal custom raise its
distracting din in our ears; but as far as His grace enables us, let us
think of that power and wisdom of God by which all things were made.
Surely such an arm as that is neither held out by stretching, nor drawn
in by contracting it. For He <span id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span
id="iii.liv-Page_292"></span>is not one and the same with the Father,
but He and the Father are one; and as equal with the Father, He is in
all respects complete, as well as the Father: so that no room is left
open for the abominable error of those who assert that the Father alone
exists, but according to the difference of causes is Himself sometimes
called the Son, sometimes the Holy Spirit; and so also from these words
may venture to say, See you perceive that the Father alone exists, if
the Son is His arm: for a man and his arm are not two persons, but one.
Not understanding nor considering how words are transferred from one
thing to another, on account of some mutual likeness, even in our daily
forms of speech about things the most familiar and visible; and how much
the more must it be so, in order that things ineffable may find some
sort of expression in our speech, things which, as they really exist,
cannot be expressed in words at all? For even one man styles another his
arm, by whom he is accustomed to transact his business: and if he is
deprived of him, he says in his grief, I have lost my arm; and to him
who has taken him away, he says, You have deprived me of my arm. Let
them understand, then, the sense in which the Son is termed the arm of
the Father, as that by which the Father hath executed all His works;
that they may not, by failing to understand this, and continuing in the
darkness of their error, resemble those Jews of whom it was said, “And
to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?”

<span id="iii.liv-p6"></span>4. And here we meet with the second
question, to treat of which, indeed, in any adequate manner, to
investigate all its mysterious windings, and throw them open to the
light in a befitting way, I think within the scope neither of my own
powers, nor of the shortness of the time, nor of your capacity. Yet, as
we cannot allow ourselves so far to disappoint your expectations as to
pass on to other topics without saying something on this, take what we
shall be able to offer you: and wherein we fail to satisfy your
expectations, ask the increase of Him who appointed us to plant and to
water; for, as the apostle saith, “Neither is he that planteth anything,
nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.” <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) There are some, then, who mutter
among themselves, and sometimes speak out when they can, and even break
forth into turbulent debate, saying: What did the Jews do, or what fault
was it of theirs, if it was a necessity “that the saying of Isaiah the
prophet should be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our
report and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?” To whom our
answer is, that the Lord, in His foreknowledge of the future, foretold
by the prophet the unbelief of the Jews; He foretold it, but did not
cause it. For God does not compel any one to sin simply because He knows
already the future sins of men. For He foreknew sins that were theirs,
not His own; sins that were referable to no one else, but to their own
selves. Accordingly, if what He foreknew as theirs is not really theirs,
then had He no true foreknowledge: but as His foreknowledge is
infallible, it is doubtless no one else, but they themselves, whose
sinfulness God foreknew, that are the sinners. The Jews, therefore,
committed sin, with no compulsion to do so on His part, to whom sin is
an object of displeasure; but He foretold their committing of it,
because nothing is concealed from His knowledge. And accordingly, had
they wished to do good instead of evil, they would not have been
hindered; but in this which they were to do they were foreseen of Him
who knows what every man will do, and what He is yet to render unto such
an one according to his work.

<span id="iii.liv-p8"></span>5. But the words of the Gospel also, that
follow, are still more pressing, and start a question of more profound
import: for He goes on to say, “Therefore they could not believe,
because that Isaiah said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened
their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand
with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.” For it is
said to us: If they could not believe, what sin is it in man not to do
what he cannot do and if they sinned in not believing, then they had the
power to believe, and did not use it. If, then, they had the power, how
says the Gospel, “Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah
said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart;” so
that (which is of grave import) to God Himself is referred the cause of
their not believing, inasmuch as it is He who “hath blinded their eyes,
and hardened their heart”? For what is thus testified to in the
prophetical Scriptures, is at least not spoken of the devil, but of God.
For were we to suppose it said of the devil, that he “hath blinded their
eyes, and hardened their heart;” we have to undertake the task of being
able to show what blame was theirs in not believing, of whom it is said,
“they could not believe.” And then, what reply shall we give touching
another testimony of this very prophet, which the Apostle Paul has
adopted, when he says: “Israel <span id="page_293">p. 293</span> <span
id="iii.liv-Page_293"></span>hath not obtained that which he seeketh
for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded,
according as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of remorse,
eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto
this day”? <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md)

<span id="iii.liv-p10"></span>6. Such, as you have just heard, brethren,
is the question that comes before us, and you can perceive how profound
it is; but we shall give what answer we can. “They could not believe,”
because that Isaiah the prophet foretold it; and the prophet foretold it
because God foreknew that such would be the case. But if I am asked why
they could not, I reply at once, because they would not; for certainly
their depraved will was foreseen by God, and foretold through the
prophet by Him from whom nothing that is future can be hid. But the
prophet, sayest thou, assigns another cause than that of their will.
What cause does the prophet assign? That “God hath given them the spirit
of remorse, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not
hear; and hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart.” This also,
I reply, their will deserved. For God thus blinds and hardens, simply by
letting alone and withdrawing His aid: and God can do this by a judgment
that is hidden, although not by one that is unrighteous. This is a
doctrine which the piety of the God-fearing ought to preserve unshaken
and inviolable in all its integrity: even as the apostle, when treating
of the same intricate question, says, “What shall we say then? is there
unrighteousness with God? God forbid.” <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) If, then, we must be far from
thinking that there is unrighteousness with God, this only can it be,
that, when He giveth His aid, He acteth mercifully; and, when He
withholdeth it, He acteth righteously: for in all He doeth, He acteth
not rashly, but in accordance with judgment. And still further, if the
judgments of the saints are righteous, how much more those of the
sanctifying and justifying God? They are therefore righteous, although
hidden. Accordingly, when questions of this sort come before us, why one
is dealt with in such a way, and another in such another way; why this
one is blinded by being forsaken of God, and that one is enlightened by
the divine aid vouchsafed to him: let us not take upon ourselves to pass
judgment on the judgment of so mighty a judge, but tremblingly exclaim
with the apostle, “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past
finding out!”  <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) As it is also
said in the psalm, “Thy judgments are as a great deep.” <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md)

<span id="iii.liv-p14"></span>7. Let not then, brethren, the
expectations of your Charity drive me to attempt the task of penetrating
into such a deep, of sounding such an abyss, of searching into what is
unsearchable. I own my own little measure of ability, and I think I have
some perception of yours also, as equally small. This is too high for my
stature, and too strong for my strength; and for yours also, I think.
Let us, therefore, listen together to the admonition and to the words of
Scripture: “Seek not out the things that are too high for thee, neither
search the things that are above thy strength.” <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) Not that such things are forbidden
us, since the divine Master saith, “There is nothing hid that shall not
be revealed:” <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) but if we walk
up to the measure of our present attainments, then, as the apostle tells
us, not only what we know not and ought to know, but also if we are
minded to know anything else, God will reveal even this unto us. <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) But if we have reached the pathway
of faith, let us keep to it with all constancy: let it be our guide to
the chamber of the King, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge. <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) For it was in no
spirit of grudging that the Lord Jesus Christ Himself acted towards
those great and specially chosen disciples of His, when He said, “I have
many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.” <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) We must be walking, making
progress, and growing, that our hearts may become fit to receive the
things which we cannot receive at present. And if the last day shall
find us sufficiently advanced, we shall then learn what here we were
unable to know.

<span id="iii.liv-p20"></span>8. If, however, any one considers himself
able, and has confidence enough, to give a clearer and better exposition
of the question before us, God forbid that I should not be still more
ready to learn than to teach. Only let no one dare to defend the freedom
of the will in any such way as to attempt depriving us of the prayer
that says, “Lead us not into temptation;” and, on the other hand, let no
one deny the freedom of the will, and so venture to find an excuse for
sin. But let us give heed to the Lord, both in commanding and in
offering His aid; in both telling us our duty, and assisting us to
discharge it. For some He hath let be lifted up to pride through an
overweening trust in their own wills, while others He hath let fall into
carelessness <span id="page_294">p. 294</span> <span
id="iii.liv-Page_294"></span>through a contrary excess of distrust. The
former say: Why do we ask God not to let us be overcome by temptation,
when it is all in our own power? The latter say: Why should we try to
live well, when the power to do so is in the hands of God? O Lord, O
Father, who art in heaven, lead us not into any of these temptations;
but “deliver us from evil!” <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md)
Listen to the Lord, when He says, “I have prayed for thee, Peter, that
thy faith fail not;” <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) that we
may never think of our faith as so lying in our free will that it has no
need of the divine assistance. Let us listen also to the evangelist,
when he says, “He hath given them power to become the sons of
God;” <span id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) that we may not imagine
it as altogether beyond our own power that we believe: but in both let
us acknowledge His beneficent acting. For, on the one side, we have to
give Him thanks that the power is bestowed; and on the other, to pray
that our own little strength may not utterly fail. It is this very faith
that worketh by love, <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md)
according to the measure thereof that the Lord hath given to every
man; <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) that he that glorieth
may glory, not in himself, but in the Lord. <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md)

<span id="iii.liv-p27"></span>9. It is no wonder, then, that they could
not believe, when such was their pride of will, that, being ignorant of
the righteousness of God, they wished to establish their own: as the
apostle says of them, “They have not submitted themselves unto the
righteousness of God.” <span id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) For it
was not by faith, but as it were by works, that they were puffed up; and
blinded by this very self-elation, they stumbled against the stone of
stumbling. And so it is said, “they could not,” by which we are to
understand that they would not; in the same way as it was said of the
Lord our God, “If we believe not, yet He abideth faithful, He cannot
deny Himself.” <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) It is said of
the Omnipotent, “He cannot.” And so, just as it is a commendation of the
divine will that the Lord “cannot deny Himself,” that they “could not
believe” is a fault chargeable on the will of man.

<span id="iii.liv-p30"></span>10. And, look you! so also say I, that
those who have such lofty ideas of themselves as to suppose that so much
must be attributed to the powers of their own will, that they deny their
need of the divine assistance in order to a righteous life, cannot
believe on Christ. For the mere syllables of Christ’s name, and the
Christian sacraments, are of no profit, where faith in Christ is itself
resisted. For faith in Christ is to believe in Him that justifieth the
ungodly; <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) to believe in the
Mediator, without whose interposition we cannot be reconciled unto God;
to believe in the Saviour, who came to seek and to save that which was
lost; <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) to believe in Him who
said, “Without me ye can do nothing.” <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) Because, then, being ignorant of
that righteousness of God that justifieth the ungodly, he wishes to set
up his own to satisfy the minds of the proud, such a man cannot believe
on Christ. And so, those Jews “could not believe:” not that men cannot
be changed for the better; but so long as their ideas run in such a
direction, they cannot believe. Hence they are blinded and hardened;
for, denying the need of divine assistance, they are not assisted. God
foreknew this regarding these Jews who were blinded and hardened, and
the prophet by His Spirit foretold it.

<span id="iii.liv-p34"></span>11. But when he added, “And they should be
converted, and I should heal them,” is there a “not” to be understood,
that is, they should *not* be converted, connecting it with the clause
before, where it is said, “that they should not see with their eyes and
understand with their heart;” for here also it is certainly meant, “and
should not understand”? For conversion itself is likewise a gift of His
grace, as when it is said to Him, “Turn us, O God of Hosts.”  <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) Or may it be that we are to
understand this also as actually taking place through the merciful
experience of the divine method of healing, \[namely this,\] that, being
of proud and perverse wills, and wishing to establish their own
righteousness, they were left alone for the very purpose of being
blinded; and thus blinded in order that they might stumble on the stone
of stumbling, and have their faces filled with shame; and so, being thus
humbled, might seek the name of the Lord, and no longer a righteousness
of their own, that inflated their pride, but the righteousness of God,
that justifieth the ungodly? For this very way turned out to the good of
many of them, who were afterwards filled with remorse for wickedness,
and believed on Christ; and on whose behalf He Himself had put up the
prayer, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) And it is of that ignorance of
theirs also that the apostle says, “I bear them record that they have a
zeal of God, but not according to knowledge:” for he then goes on also
to add, “For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to
establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto
the righteousness of God.” <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md)

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span id="iii.liv-Page_295"></span>

<span id="iii.liv-p38"></span>12. “These things said Isaiah, when he saw
His glory, and spake of Him.” What Isaiah saw, and how it refers to
Christ the Lord, are to be read and learned in his book. For he saw Him,
not as He is, but in some symbolical way to suit the form that the
vision of the prophet had itself to assume. For Moses likewise saw Him,
and yet we find him saying to Him whom he saw, “If I have found grace in
Thy sight, show me now Thyself, that I may clearly see Thee;”  <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097.md) for he saw Him not as He is. But
the time when this shall yet be our experience, that same Saint John the
Evangelist tells us in his Epistle: “Dearly beloved, \[now\] are we the
sons of God; and it hath not yet become manifest what we shall be:
because we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we
shall see Him as He is.” <span id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098.md) He
might have said “for we shall see Him,” without adding “as He is;” but
because he knew that He was seen of some of the fathers and prophets,
but not as He is, therefore after saying “we shall see Him,” he added
“as He is.” And be not deceived, brethren, by any of those who assert
that the Father is invisible, and the Son visible. This assertion is
made by those who think that the latter is a creature, and whose
understanding runs not in harmony with the words, “I and my Father
one.” <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md) Accordingly, as
respects the form of God wherein He is equal with the Father, the Son
also is invisible: but, in order to be seen of men, He assumed the form
of a servant, and being made in the likeness of men, <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) became visible to man. He showed
Himself, therefore, even before His incarnation, to the eyes of men, as
it pleased Him, in the creature-form at His command, but not as He is.
Let us be purifying our hearts by faith, that we may be prepared for
that ineffable and, so to speak, invisible vision. For “blessed are the
pure in heart; for they shall see God.” <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md)

<span id="iii.liv-p44"></span>13. “Nevertheless among the chief rulers
also many believed on Him; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not
confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they
loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.” See how the
evangelist marked and disapproved of some, who yet, he said, believed on
Him: who, if ever they did advance though this gateway of faith, would
thereby also overcome that love of human glory which had been overcome
by the apostle, when he said, “God forbid that I should glory, save in
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto
me, and I unto the world.” <span id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md)
For to this end also did the Lord Himself, when derided by the madness
of human pride and impiety, fix His cross on the foreheads of those who
believed on Him, on that which is in a manner the abode of modesty, that
faith may learn not to blush at His name, and love the glory of God more
than the glory of men.
