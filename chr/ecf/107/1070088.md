<span id="iii.lxxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxxxvi-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXXXV.</span>

<span id="iii.lxxxvi-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxxxvi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxxxvi-p2.2"></span>Chapter XV. 14, 15</span>.

<span id="iii.lxxxvi-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxxvi-p3.1"></span>When</span> the Lord Jesus had commended the
love which He manifested toward us in dying for us, and had said,
“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
his friends,” He added, “Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I
command you.” What great condescension! when one cannot even be a good
servant unless he do his lord’s commandments; the very means, which only
prove men to be good servants, He wished to be those whereby His friends
should be known. But the condescension, as I have termed it, is this,
that the Lord condescends to call those His friends whom He knows to be
His servants. For, to let us know that it is the duty of servants to
yield obedience to their master’s commands, He actually in another place
reproaches those who are servants, by saying, “And why call ye me, Lord,
Lord, and do not the things that I say?” <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) Accordingly, when ye say Lord,
prove what you say by doing my commandments. Is it not to the obedient
servant that He is yet one day to say, “Well done, thou good servant;
because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord”? <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) One, therefore, who is a good
servant, can be both servant and friend.

<span id="iii.lxxxvi-p6"></span>2. But let us mark what follows.
“Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what
his lord doeth.” How, then are we to understand the good servant to be
both servant and friend, when He says, “Henceforth I call you not
servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth”? He
introduces the name of friend in such a way as to withdraw that of
servant; not as if to include both in the one term, but in order that
the one should succeed to the place vacated by the other. What does it
mean? Is it this, that even in doing the Lord’s commandments we shall
not be servants? Or this, that then we shall cease to be servants, when
we have been good servants? And yet who can contradict the Truth, when
He says, “Henceforth I call you not servants?” and shows why He said so:
“For the servant,” He adds, “knoweth not what his lord doeth.” Is it
that a good and tried servant is not likewise entrusted by his master
with his secrets? What does He mean, then, by saying, “The servant
knoweth not what his lord doeth”? Be it that “he knoweth not what he
doeth,” is he ignorant also of what he commands? For if he were so, how
can he serve? Or how is he a servant who does no service? And yet the
Lord speaks thus: “Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
Henceforth I call you not servants.” Truly a marvellous statement!
Seeing we cannot serve the Lord but by doing His commandments, how is it
that in doing so we shall cease to be servants? If I be not a servant in
doing His commandments, and yet cannot be in His service unless I so do,
then, in my very service, I am no longer a servant.

<span id="iii.lxxxvi-p7"></span>3. Let us, brethren, let us understand,
and may the Lord enable us to understand, and enable us also to do what
we understand. And if we know this, we know of a truth what the Lord
doeth; for it is only the Lord that so enables us, and by such means
only do we attain to His friendship. For just as there <span
id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span id="iii.lxxxvi-Page_352"></span>are
two kinds of fear, which produce two classes of fearers; so there are
two kinds of service, which produce two classes of servants. There is a
fear, which perfect love casteth out; <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) and there is another fear, which is
clean, and endureth for ever. <span id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md)
The fear that lies not in love, the apostle pointed to when he said,
“For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.” <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) But he referred to the clean fear
when he said, “Be not high-minded, but fear.” <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) In that fear which love casteth
out, there has also to be cast out the service along with it: for both
were joined together by the apostle, that is, the service and the fear,
when he said, “For ye have not received the spirit of service again to
fear.” And it was the servant connected with this kind of service that
the Lord also had in His eye when He said, “Henceforth I call you not
servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.” Certainly
not the servant characterized by the clean fear, to whom it is said,
“Well done, thou good servant: enter thou into the joy of thy lord;” but
the servant who is characterized by the fear which love casteth out, of
whom He elsewhere saith, “The servant abideth not in the house for ever,
but the Son abideth ever.” <span id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md)
Since, therefore, He hath given us power to become the sons of
God, <span id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) let us not be servants,
but sons: that, in some wonderful and indescribable but real way, we may
as servants have the power not to be servants; servants, indeed, with
that clean fear which distinguishes the servant that enters into the joy
of his lord, but not servants with the fear that has to be cast out, and
which marketh him that abideth not in the house for ever. But let us
bear in mind that it is the Lord that enableth us to serve so as not to
be servants. And this it is that is unknown to the servant, who knoweth
not what his Lord doeth; and who, when he doeth any good thing, is
lifted up as if he did it himself, and not his Lord; and so, glories not
in the Lord, but in himself, thereby deceiving himself, because
glorying, as if he had not received. <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) But let us, beloved, in order that
we may be the friends of the Lord, know what our Lord doeth. For it is
He who makes us not only men, but also righteous, and not we ourselves.
And who but He is the doer, in leading us to such a knowledge? For “we
have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of
God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
God.” <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) Whatever good there is,
is freely given by Him. And so because this also is good, by Him who
graciously imparteth all good is this gift of knowing likewise bestowed;
that, in respect of all good things whatever, he that glorieth may glory
in the Lord. <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) But the words
that follow, “But I have called you friends; for all things that I have
heard of my Father I have made known unto you,” are so profound, that we
must by no means compress them within the limits of the present
discourse, but leave them over till another.
