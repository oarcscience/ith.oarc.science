<span id="iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Homily V.</span>

<span id="iv.viii-p2"></span><span id="iv.viii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iv.viii-p2.2"></span>1 John III. 9</span>–<span
class="c10"><span id="iv.viii-p2.3"></span>18</span>

<span id="iv.viii-p3"></span>“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit
sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is
born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children
of the devil: whosoever is not righteous is not of God, neither he that
loveth not his brother. For this is the message that ye heard from the
beginning, that we should love one another. Not as Cain, who was of the
wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his
own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous. Marvel not, my
brethren, if the world hate us. We know that we have passed from death
unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in
death. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. In this we know love, that He
laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the
brethren. But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have
need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how can the
love of God dwell in him? My little children, let us not love only in
word and in tongue; but in deed and in truth.”

<span id="iv.viii-p4"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.viii-p4.1"></span>Hear</span> intently, I do beseech you, because
it is no small matter that we have to cope withal: and I doubt not,
because ye were intent upon it yesterday, that ye have with even greater
intentness of purpose come together to-day. For it is no slight
question, how he saith in this Epistle, “Whosoever is born of God,
sinneth not,” <span id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236.md) and how in the
same Epistle he hath said above, “If we say that we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” <span
id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237.md) What shall the man do, who is
pressed by both sayings out of the same Epistle? If he shall confess
himself a sinner, he fears lest it be said to him, Then art thou not
born of God; because it is written, “Whosoever is born of God, sinneth
not.” But if he shall say that he is just and that he hath no sin, he
receives on the other side a blow from the same Epistle, “If we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”
Placed then as he is in the midst, what he can say and what confess, or
what profess, he cannot find. To profess himself to be without sin, is
full of peril; and not only full of peril, but also full of error: “We
deceive ourselves,” saith he, “and the truth is not in us, if we say
that we have no sin.” But oh that thou hadst none, and saidst this! for
then wouldest thou say truly, and in uttering the truth wouldest have
not so much as a vestige of wrong to be afraid of. But, that thou doest
ill if thou say so, is because it is a lie that thou sayest. “The
truth,” saith he, “is not in us, if we say that we have no sin.” He
saith not, “Have not had;” <span id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="iv.viii-Page_488"></span>lest haply it should seem to be spoken of
the past life. For the man here hath had sins: but from the time that he
was born of God, he has begun not to have sins. If it were so, there
would be no question to embarrass us. For we should say, We have been
sinners, but now we are justified: we have had sin, but now we have
none. He saith not this: but what saith he? “If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” And then after a
while he says on the other hand, “Whosoever is born of God sinneth not.”
Was John himself not born of God? If John was not born of God, John, of
whom ye have heard that he lay in the Lord’s bosom; does any man dare
engage for himself that in him has taken place that regeneration which
it was not granted to that man to have, to whom it was granted to lie in
the bosom of the Lord? The man whom the Lord loved more than the
rest, <span id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238.md) him alone had He not
begotten of the Spirit?

<span id="iv.viii-p8"></span>2. Mark now these words. As yet, I am
urging it upon you, what straits we are put to that by putting your
minds on the stretch, that is, by your praying for us and for
yourselves, God may make enlargement, and give us an outlet: lest some
man find in His word an occasion of his own perdition, that word which
was preached and put in writing only for healing and salvation. “Every
man,” saith he, “that doeth sin, doeth also iniquity.” Lest haply thou
make a distinction, “Sin is iniquity.” Lest thou say, A sinner I am, but
not a doer of iniquity, “Sin is iniquity. And ye know that to this end
was He manifested, that He should take away sin; and there is no sin in
Him.” And what doth it profit us, that He came without sin? “Every one
that sinneth not, abideth in Him: and every one that sinneth, hath not
seen Him, neither known Him. Little children, let no man seduce you. He
that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.” This we
have already said, that the word “as” is wont to be used of a certain
resemblance, not of equality. “He that doeth sin is of the devil,
because the devil sinneth from the beginning.” This too we have already
said, that the devil created no man, nor begat any, but his imitators
are, as it were, born of him. “To this end was the Son of God
manifested, that He should undo <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239.md) the works of the devil.”
Consequently, to undo (or loose) sins, He that hath no sin. And then
follows: “Every one that is born of God doth not commit sin; for his
seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of
God:” <span id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md) he has drawn the cord
tight!—Belike, it is in regard of some one sin that he hath said, “Doth
not sin,” not in regard of all sin: that in this that he saith, “Whoso
is born of God, doth not sin,” thou mayest understand some one
particular sin, which that man who is born of God cannot commit: <span
id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) and such is that sin that, if one
commit it, it confirms the rest. What is this sin? To do contrary to the
commandment. What is the commandment? “A new commandment give I unto
you, that ye love one another.” <span
id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) Mark well! This commandment of
Christ is called, “love.” By this love sins are loosed. If this love be
not kept, the not holding it is at once a grievous sin, and the root of
all sins.

<span id="iv.viii-p14"></span>3. Mark well, brethren; we have brought
forward somewhat in which, to them that have good understanding, the
question is solved. But do we only walk in the way with them that run
more swiftly? Those that walk more slowly must not be left behind. Let
us turn the matter every way, in such words as we can, in order that it
may be brought within reach of all. For I suppose, brethren, that every
man is concerned for his own soul, who does not come to Church without
cause, who does not seek temporal things in the Church, who does not
come here to transact secular business; but comes here in order that he
may lay hold upon some eternal thing, promised unto him, whereunto he
may attain: he must needs consider how he shall walk in the way, lest he
be left behind, lest he go back, lest he go astray, lest by halting he
do not attain. Whoever therefore is in earnest, let him be slow, let him
be swift, yet let him not leave the way. This then I have said, that
<span id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span id="iv.viii-Page_489"></span>in
saying, “Whosoever is born of God sinneth not,” it is probable he meant
it of some particular sin: for else it will be contrary to that place:
“If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
not in us.” In this way then the question may be solved. There is a
certain sin, which he that is born of God cannot commit; a sin, which
not being committed, other sins are loosed, and being committed, other
sins are confirmed. What is this sin? To do contrary to the commandment
of Christ, contrary to the New Testament. <span
id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243.md) What is the new commandment? “A new
commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.” <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244.md) Whoso doeth contrary to charity and
contrary to brotherly love, let him not dare to glory and say that he is
born of God: but whoso is in brotherly love, there are certain sins
which he cannot commit, and this above all, that he should hate his
brother. And how fares it with him concerning his other sins, of which
it is said, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
the truth is not in us?” Let him hear that which shall set his mind at
rest from another place of Scripture; “Charity covereth a multitude of
sins.” <span id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245.md)

<span id="iv.viii-p18"></span>4. Charity therefore we commend; charity
this Epistle commendeth. The Lord, after His resurrection, what question
put He to Peter, but, “Lovest thou me?” <span
id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246.md) And it was not enough to ask it
once; a second time also He put none other question, a third time also
none other. Although when it came to the third time, Peter, as one who
knew not what was the drift of this, was grieved because it seemed as if
the Lord did not believe him; nevertheless both a first time and a
second, and a third He put this question. Thrice fear denied, thrice
love confessed. Behold Peter loveth the Lord. What is he to do for the
Lord? For think not that he in the Psalm did not feel himself at a loss
what to do: “What shall I render unto the Lord for all the benefits He
hath done unto me?” <span id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247.md) He that
said this in the Psalm, marked what great things had been done for him
by God; and sought what he should render to God, and could find nothing.
For whatever thou wouldest render, from Him didst thou receive it to
render. And what did he find to offer in return? That which, as we said,
my brethren, he had received from Him, that only found he to offer in
return. “I will receive the cup of salvation, and will call upon the
name of the Lord.” For who had given him the cup of salvation, but He to
whom he wished to offer in return? Now to receive the cup of salvation,
and call upon the name of the Lord, is to be filled with charity; and so
filled, that not only thou shalt not hate thy brother, but shall be
prepared to die for thy brother. This is perfect charity, that thou be
prepared to die for thy brother. This the Lord exhibited in Himself, who
died for all, praying for them by whom He was crucified, and saying,
“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248.md) But if He alone hath done this, He
was not a Master, if He had no disciples. Disciples who came after Him
have done this. <span id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249.md) Men were
stoning Stephen, and he knelt down and said, “Lord, lay not this sin to
their charge.” <span id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250.md) He loved them
that were killing him; since for them also he was dying. Hear also the
Apostle Paul: “And I myself,” saith he, “will be spent for your
souls.” <span id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251.md) For he was among
those for whom Stephen, when by their hands he was dying, besought
forgiveness. This then is perfect charity. If any man shall have so
great charity that he is prepared even to die for his brethren, in that
man is perfect charity. But as soon as it is born, is it already quite
perfect? That it may be made perfect, it is born; when born, it is
nourished; when nourished, it is strengthened; when strengthened, it is
perfected; when it has come to perfection, what saith it? “To me to live
is Christ, and to die is gain. I wished to be dissolved, and to be with
Christ; which is far better: nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
needful for you.” <span id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252.md) For their
sakes he was willing to live, for whose sakes he was prepared to die.

<span id="iv.viii-p26"></span>5. And that ye may know that it is this
perfect charity which that man violates not, and against which that man
sins not, who is born of God; this is what the Lord saith to Peter;
“Peter lovest thou me?” And he answers, “I love.” He saith not, If thou
love me, shew kindness to me. For when the Lord was in mortal flesh, He
hungered, He thirsted: at that time when He hungered and thirsted, He
was taken in as a guest; those who had the means, ministered unto Him of
their substance, as we read in the Gospel. Zacchæus entertained Him as
his guest: he was saved from his disease by entertaining the Physician.
From what disease? The disease of avarice. For he was very rich, and the
chief of the publicans. Mark the man made whole from the disease of
avarice: “The half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken
any thing from <span id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span
id="iv.viii-Page_490"></span>any man, I will restore him
fourfold.” <span id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253.md) That he kept the
other half, was not to enjoy it, but to pay his debts. Well, he at that
time entertained the Physician as his guest, because there was infirmity
of the flesh in the Lord, to which men might show this kindness; and
this, because it was His will to grant this very thing to them that did
Him kind service; for the benefit was to them that did the service, not
to Him. For, could He to whom angels ministered require these men’s
kindness? Not even His servant Elias, to whom He sent bread and flesh by
the ravens upon a certain occasion <span
id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254.md) had need of this; and yet that a
religious widow might be blessed, the servant of God is sent, and he
whom God in secret did feed, is fed by the widow. But still, although by
the means of these servants of God, those who consider their need get
good to themselves, in respect of that reward most manifestly set forth
by the Lord in the Gospel: “He that receiveth a righteous man in the
name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward: and he
that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a
prophet’s reward: and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these
little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I
say unto you, He shall in no wise lose his reward:” <span
id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md) although, then, they that do this,
do it to their own good: yet neither could this kind office be done to
Him when about to ascend <span id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256.md) into
Heaven. What could Peter, who loved Him, render unto Him? Hear what.
“Feed my sheep:” *i.e.* do for the brethren, that which I have done for
thee. I redeemed all with my blood: hesitate not to die for confession
of the truth, that the rest may imitate you.

<span id="iv.viii-p31"></span>6. But this, as we have said, brethren, is
perfect charity. He that is born of God hath it. Mark, my beloved, see
what I say. Behold, a man has received the Sacrament of that birth,
being baptized; he hath the Sacrament, and a great Sacrament, divine,
holy, ineffable. Consider what a Sacrament! To make him a new man by
remission of all sins! Nevertheless, let him look well to the heart,
whether that be thoroughly done there, which is done in the body; let
him see whether he have charity, and then say, I am born of God. If
however he have it not, he has indeed the soldier’s mark upon him, but
he roams as a deserter. Let him have charity; otherwise let him not say
that he is born of God. But he says, I have the Sacrament. Hear the
Apostle: “If I know all mysteries, <span
id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257.md) and have all faith, so that I can
remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.” <span
id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258.md)

<span id="iv.viii-p34"></span>7. This, if ye remember, we gave you to
understand in beginning to read this Epistle, that nothing in it is so
commended as charity. Even if it seems to speak of various other things,
to this it makes its way back, and whatever it says, it will needs bring
all to bear upon charity. Let us see whether it does so here. Mark:
“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.” We ask, what sin?
because if thou understand all sin, it will be contrary to that place,
“If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
not in us.” Then let him say what sin; let him teach us; lest haply I
may have rashly said that the sin here is the violation of charity,
because he said above, “He that hateth his brother is in darkness, and
walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the
darkness hath blinded his eyes.” <span
id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259.md) But perhaps he has said something
in what comes afterwards, and has mentioned charity by name? See that
this circuit of words hath this end, hath this issue. “Whosoever is born
of God, sinneth not, because His seed remaineth in him.” <span
id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260.md) The “seed” of God, *i.e.* the word
of God: whence the apostle saith, “I have begotten you through the
Gospel. And he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” <span
id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261.md) Let him tell us this, let us see in
what we cannot sin. “In this are manifested the children of God and the
children of the devil. Whosoever is not righteous is not of God, neither
he that loveth not his brother.” <span
id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262.md) Aye, now indeed it is manifest of
what he speaks: “Neither he that loveth not his brother.” Therefore,
love alone puts the difference between the children of God and the
children of the devil. Let them all sign themselves with the sign of the
cross of Christ; let them all respond, Amen; let all sing Alleluia; let
all be baptized, let all come to church, let all build the walls of
churches: there is no discerning of the children of God from the
children of the devil, but only by charity. They that have charity are
born of God: they that have it not, are not born of God. A mighty token,
a mighty distinction! Have what thou wilt; if this alone thou have not,
it profiteth thee nothing: other things if thou have not, have this, and
thou hast fulfilled the law. “For he that loveth another hath fulfilled
the law,” saith the apostle: and, “Charity is the fulfilling of the
law.” <span id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263.md) I take this to be the
pearl which the merchant man in the Gospel is described to have been
seeking, who <span id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span
id="iv.viii-Page_491"></span> “found one pearl, and sold all that he
had, and bought it.” <span id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264.md) This is
the pearl of price, Charity, without which whatever thou mayest have,
profiteth thee nothing: which if alone thou have, it sufficeth thee.
Now, with faith thou seest, then with actual beholding <span
id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md) thou shalt see. For if we love when
we see not, how shall we embrace it when we see! But wherein must we
exercise ourselves? In brotherly love. Thou mayest say to me, I have not
seen God: canst thou say to me, I have not seen man? Love thy brother.
For if thou love thy brother whom thou seest, at the same time thou
shalt see God also; because thou shalt see Charity itself, and within
dwelleth God.

<span id="iv.viii-p42"></span>8. “Whosoever is not righteous is not of
God, neither he that loveth not his brother.” <span
id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266.md) “For this is the message:” mark how
he confirms it: “For this is the message which we heard from the
beginning, that we should love one another.” He has made it manifest to
us that it is of this he speaks; whoso acts against this commandment, is
in that accursed sin, into which those fall who are not born of God.
“Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And
wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his
brother’s righteous.”  <span id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267.md)
Therefore, where envy is, brotherly love cannot be. Mark, my beloved. He
that envieth, loveth not. The sin of the devil is in that man; because
the devil through envy cast man down. For he fell, and envied him that
stood. He did not wish to cast man down that he himself might stand, but
only that he might not fall alone. Hold fast in your mind from this that
he has subjoined, that envy cannot exist in charity. Thou hast it
openly, when charity was praised, “Charity envieth not.” <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268.md) There was no charity in Cain; and
had there been no charity in Abel, God would not have accepted his
sacrifice. For when they had both offered, the one of the fruits of the
earth, the other of the offspring of the flock; what think ye, brethren,
that God slighted the fruits of the earth, and loved the offspring of
the flock? God had not regard to the hands, but saw in the heart: and
whom He saw offer with charity, to his sacrifice He had respect; whom He
saw offer with envy, from his sacrifice He turned away His eyes. By the
good works, then, of Abel, he means only charity: by the evil works of
Cain he means only his hatred of his brother. It was not enough that he
hated his brother and envied his good works; because he would not
imitate, he would kill. And hence it appeared that he was a child of the
devil, and hence also that the other was God’s righteous one. Hence then
are men discerned, my brethren. Let no man mark the tongue, but the
deeds and the heart. If any do not good for his brethren, he shews what
he has in him. By temptations are men proved.

<span id="iv.viii-p46"></span>9. “Marvel not, brethren, if the world
hate us.” <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269.md) Must one often be
telling you what “the world” means? Not the heaven, not the earth, nor
these visible works which God made; but lovers of the world. By often
saying these things, to some I am burdensome: but I am so far from
saying it without a cause, that some may be questioned whether I said
it, and they cannot answer. Let then, even by thrusting it upon them,
something stick fast in the hearts of them that hear. What is “the
world”? The world, when put in a bad sense, is, lovers of the world: the
world, when the word is used in praise, is heaven and earth, and the
works of God that are in them; whence it is said, “And the world was
made by Him.” <span id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270.md) Also, the world
is the fullness of the earth, as John himself hath said, “Not only for
our sins is He the propitiator, but (for the sins) of the whole
world:” <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271.md) he means, “of the
world,” of all the faithful scattered throughout the whole earth. But
the world in a bad sense, is, lovers of the world. They that love the
world, cannot love their brother.

<span id="iv.viii-p50"></span>10. “If the world hate us: we know”—What
do we know?—“that we have passed from death unto life”—How do we know?
“Because we love the brethren.” <span
id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272.md) Let none ask man: let each return
to his own heart: if he find there brotherly love, let him set his mind
at rest, because he is “passed from death unto life.” Already he is on
the right hand: let him not regard that at present his glory is hidden:
when the Lord shall come, then shall he appear in glory. For he has life
in him, but as yet in winter; the root is alive, but the branches, so to
say, are dry: within is the substance that has the life in it, within
are the leaves of trees, within are the fruits: but they wait for the
summer. Well then, “we know that we have passed from death unto life,
because we love the brethren. He that loveth not, abideth in death.”
Lest ye should think it a light matter, brethren, to hate, or, not to
love, hear what follows: “Every one that hateth his brother, is a
murderer.” <span id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md) How now, if any
made light of hating his brother, will he also in his heart make light
of murder? He does not stir his hands to kill a man; yet he is already
held <span id="page_492">p. 492</span> <span
id="iv.viii-Page_492"></span>by God a murderer; the other lives, and yet
this man is already judged as his slayer! “Every one that hateth his
brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life
abiding in him.”

<span id="iv.viii-p53"></span>11. “In this know we love:” <span
id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md) he means, perfection of love, that
perfection which we have bidden you lay to heart: “In this know we love,
that He laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives
for the brethren.” Lo here, whence that came: “Peter, lovest thou me?
Feed My sheep.” <span id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275.md) For, that ye
may know that He would have His sheep to be so fed by him, as that he
should lay down his life for the sheep, straightway said He this to him:
“When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou
wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy
hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest
not. This spake He,” saith the evangelist, “signifying by what death he
should glorify God;” so that to whom He had said, Feed my sheep,” the
same He might teach to lay down his life for His sheep.

<span id="iv.viii-p56"></span>12. Whence beginneth charity, brethren?
Attend a little: to what it is perfected, ye have heard; the very end of
it, and the very measure of it is what the Lord hath put before us in
the Gospel: “Greater love hath no man,” saith He, “than that one lay
down his life for his friends.” <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md) Its perfection, therefore, He hath
put before us in the Gospel, and here also it is its perfection that is
put before us: but ye ask yourselves, and say to yourselves, When shall
it be possible for us to have “this” charity? Do not too soon despair of
thyself. Haply, it is born and is not yet perfect; nourish it, that it
be not choked. But thou wilt say to me, And by what am I to know it? For
to what it is perfected, we have heard; whence it begins, let us hear.
He goes on to say: “But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his
brother have hunger, <span id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) and
shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how can the love of God
dwell in him?” <span id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) Lo, whence
charity begins withal! <span id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) If
thou art not yet equal to the dying for thy brother, be thou even now
equal to the giving of thy means to thy brother. Even now let charity
smite thy bowels, that not of vainglory thou shouldest do it, but of the
innermost <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) marrow of mercy;
that thou consider him, now in want. For if thy superfluities thou canst
not give to thy brother, canst thou lay down thy life for thy brother?
There lies thy money in thy bosom, which thieves may take from thee; and
though thieves do not take it, by dying thou wilt leave it, even if it
leave not thee while living: what wilt thou do with it? Thy brother
hungers, he is in necessity: belike he is in suspense, is distressed by
his creditor: he is thy brother, alike ye are bought, one is the price
paid for you, ye are both redeemed by the blood of Christ: see whether
thou have mercy, if thou have this world’s means. Perchance thou sayest,
“What concerns it me? Am I to give my money, that he may not suffer
trouble?” If this be the answer thy heart makes to thee, the love of the
Father abideth not in thee. If the love of the Father abide not in thee,
thou art not born of God. How boastest thou to be a Christian? Thou hast
the name, and hast not the deeds. But if the work shall follow the name,
let any call thee pagan, show thou by deeds that thou art a Christian.
For if by deeds thou dost not show thyself a Christian, all men may call
thee a Christian yet; what doth the name profit thee where the thing is
not forthcoming? “But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his
brother have need, <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) and
shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how can the love of God
dwell in him?” And then he goes on: “My little children, let us not love
in word, neither in tongue but in deed and in truth.” <span
id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md)

<span id="iv.viii-p67"></span>13. I suppose the thing is now made
manifest to you my brethren: this great and most concerning secret and
mystery. <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) What is the force of
charity, all Scripture doth set forth; but I know not whether any where
it be more largely set forth than in this Epistle. We pray you and
beseech you in the Lord, that both what ye have heard ye will keep in
<span id="page_493">p. 493</span> <span
id="iv.viii-Page_493"></span>memory, and to that which is yet to be
said, until the epistle be finished, will come with earnestness, and
with earnestness hear the same. But open ye your heart for the good
seed: root out the thorns, that that which we are sowing in you be not
choked, but rather that the harvest may grow, and that the Husbandman
may rejoice and make ready the barn for you as for grain, not the fire
as for the chaff.

<span id="iv.viii-p11"></span> \[“*Cannot sin*,” &c.—Augustin maintains
that the one sin which the Christian cannot commit is violation of
charity; he cannot do otherwise than love, and do acts that flow from
love, if he be a Christian. No doubt this indicates a great truth, for
love expresses the inner essence of the believer’s life and character.
But the strong language of the apostle is not met by this partial
statement.

<span id="iv.viii-p12"></span>Better acknowledge the apparent
contradiction between “does not commit sin,” “cannot sin,” and “if we
say, we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.” The apostle does not solve
the problem. Meyer, who discards many explanations of the first two
phrases,—as, sinning knowingly and wilfully, committing mortal sins and
many others specified by him, thinks that the solution lies in the fact
simply that the apostle desires to emphasize the contrast between born
of God and a sinner. He does not show how emphasizing a contrast
explains a contradiction (which he discovers in the passage). Jonathan
Edwards and Ezek. Hopkins, following many others with whom Westcott
coincides, judge that the alleged impossibility of sinning relates to
total character, or prevailing habit; the Christian may be surprised,
overtaken, beguiled by sin, but fights against sin, does not consent to
sin with his whole heart; “he does not wish sin.” It has been added that
as to his nature—renewed; as to the new life—life from the Spirit of
God,—his divine sonship and sin are irreconcilable contraries. In part,
these suggestions and definitions may meet the difficulty which the
apostle, doubtless wishing to present a high ideal of the life of one
born from above, leaves for practical solution by those who have passed
from death unto life.—J.H.M.\]

<span id="iv.viii-p60"></span> \[*Love; beneficence*.—Augustin
throughout these homilies amply vindicates his own declaration that the
epistle on which he is commenting relates largely to charity; and his
glowing words not only exhibit love as one star in the constellation of
Christian graces, but as a deep and joyous principle and centre of life,
“a well of water” within, from which refreshing streams of beneficence
will spontaneously gush forth.

<span id="iv.viii-p61"></span>He controverts those in his day who taught
that it was enough to have the truth, to possess right opinions, and
that such need not be forward in sacrificing aught for the truth’s sake,
or to help their brethren. And in kindly reproof of such indolent and
ignorant self seeking, he points the earnest believer to whom comes the
lofty utterance of the apostle, lay down life, if need be, for thy
brother, and who shrinks from such a test, to a lower evidence of the
Christ-like mind, within the reach of all, and from which all may go up
higher—“help thy brother in his necessity, relieve his wants; if not
ready to do this for the brother before your eyes, how can you pretend
love to the unseen Father and Friend?”

<span id="iv.viii-p62"></span>As the apostle’s reprehension of errorists
in his day is applicable in refutation of many false opinions rife in
our times, so his and Augustin’s fervent commendation of the surpassing
excellence of love, and the absolute need, for the believer, of
uniformly and constantly manifesting it in act and life, can never be
superfluous, can never grow old.

<span id="iv.viii-p63"></span>Indifferentism as to doctrine, and
careless coldness with respect to the sufferings of others, against both
of which St. John lifts up his voice, if not peculiar to our day and
nation, are yet deplorable evils among us, demanding energetic and
practical protests from those who love the truth and love man.—J.H.M.\]
