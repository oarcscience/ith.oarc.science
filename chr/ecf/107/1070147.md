<span id="iv.xix-p1"></span> *De Trinitate, lib. i. 6, § 9.*

<span id="iv.xix-p2"></span>And if the Son be not of the same substance
as the Father, then is He a made substance: if a made substance, then
not “all things were made by Him:” but, “all things were made by
Him;” <span id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567.md) therefore, He is of one
and the same substance with the Father. And therefore, not only God, but
*True* (or, Very) *God*. Which the same John doth most openly affirm in
his epistle: “*Scimus quod Filius Dei venerit et dederit nobis
intellectum ut cognoscamus verum Deum, et simus in vero Filio ejus Jesu
Christo. Hic est verus Deus et vita æterna*.” “We know that the Son of
God is come; and hath given us an understanding that we may (learn to)
know the True God, <span id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md) and may be
in His true Son Jesus Christ. This is the True God and Eternal Life.”

<span id="iv.xix-p5"></span>10. Hence also by consequence we understand,
that what the apostle Paul saith, “Who only hath immortality,” <span
id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md) he saith not merely of the Father,
but of the One and Only God, which the Trinity itself is. For neither is
the “Eternal Life” itself mortal in respect of any mutability: and
consequently, since the Son of God “is Eternal Life,” He also is to be
understood together with the Father, where it is said, “Who only hath
immortality.”
