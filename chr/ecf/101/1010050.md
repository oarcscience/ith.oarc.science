<span id="vi.III.IV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.III.IV-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—In the Nineteenth Year of His Age
(His Father Having Died Two Years Before) He is Led by the “Hortensius”
Of Cicero to “Philosophy,” To God, and a Better Mode of Thinking.</span>

<span id="vi.III.IV-p2"></span>7. Among such as these, at that unstable
period of my life, I studied books of eloquence, wherein I was eager to
be eminent from a damnable and inflated purpose, even a delight in human
vanity. In the ordinary course of study, I lighted upon a certain book
of Cicero, whose language, though not his heart, almost all admire. This
book of his contains an exhortation to philosophy, and is called
*Hortensius*. This book, in truth, changed my affections, and turned my
prayers to Thyself, O Lord, and made me have other hopes and desires.
Worthless suddenly became every vain hope to me; and, with an incredible
warmth of heart, I <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span
id="vi.III.IV-Page_62"></span>yearned for an immortality of
wisdom, <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223) and began now to
arise <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224) that I might return to
Thee. Not, then, to improve my language—which I appeared to be
purchasing with my mother’s means, in that my nineteenth year, my father
having died two years before—not to improve my language did I have
recourse to that book; nor did it persuade me by its style, but its
matter.

<span id="vi.III.IV-p5"></span>8. How ardent was I then, my God, how
ardent to fly from earthly things to Thee! Nor did I know how Thou
wouldst deal with me. For with Thee is wisdom. In Greek the love of
wisdom is called “philosophy,” <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225)
with which that book inflamed me. There be some who seduce through
philosophy, under a great, and alluring, and honourable name colouring
and adorning their own errors. And almost all who in that and former
times were such, are in that book censured and pointed out. There is
also disclosed that most salutary admonition of Thy Spirit, by Thy good
and pious servant: “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and
vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the
world, and not after Christ: for in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead bodily.” <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226) And since at
that time (as Thou, O Light of my heart, knowest) the words of the
apostle were unknown to me, I was delighted with that exhortation, in so
far only as I was thereby stimulated, and enkindled, and inflamed to
love, seek, obtain, hold, and embrace, not this or that sect, but wisdom
itself, whatever it were; and this alone checked me thus ardent, that
the name of Christ was not in it. For this name, according to Thy mercy,
O Lord, this name of my Saviour Thy Son, had my tender heart piously
drunk in, deeply treasured even with my mother’s milk; and whatsoever
was without that name, though never so erudite, polished, and truthful,
took not complete hold of me.

<span id="vi.III.IV-p3"></span> Up to the time of Cicero the Romans
employed the term *sapientia* for <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.III.IV-p3.1"></span> φιλοσοφία</span> (Monboddo’s Ancient
Metaphys. i. 5). It is interesting to watch the effect of the philosophy
in which they had been trained on the writings of some of the Fathers.
Even Justin Martyr, the first after the “Apostolic,” has traces of this
influence. See the account of his search for “wisdom,” and conversion,
in his *Dialogue with Trypho*, ii. and iii.
