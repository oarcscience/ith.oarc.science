id="vi.XIII.XXXVIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Of the Difference
Between the Knowledge of God and of Men, and of the Repose Which is to
Be Sought from God Only.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXVIII-p2"></span>53. We therefore see those things
which Thou madest, because they are; but they are because Thou seest
them. And we see without that they are, and within that they are good,
but Thou didst see them there, when made, where Thou didst see them to
be made. And we were at another time moved to do well, after our hearts
had conceived of Thy Spirit; but in the former time, forsaking Thee, we
were moved to do evil; but Thou, the One, the Good God, hast never
ceased to do good. And we also have certain good works, of Thy gift, but
not eternal; after these we hope to rest in Thy great hallowing. But
Thou, being the Good, needing no good, art ever at rest, because Thou
Thyself art Thy rest. And what man will teach man to understand this? Or
what angel, an angel? Or what angel, a man? Let it be asked of Thee,
sought in Thee, knocked for at Thee; so, even so shall it be received,
so shall it be found, so shall it be opened. <span
