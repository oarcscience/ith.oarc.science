id="vi.X.XXII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—A Happy Life is to Rejoice in
God, and for God.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXII-p2"></span>32. Let it be far, O Lord,—let it be far
from the heart of Thy servant who confesseth unto Thee; let it be far
from me to think myself happy, be the joy what it may. For there is a
joy which is not granted to the “wicked,” <span
id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) but to those who worship Thee
thankfully, whose joy Thou Thyself art. And the happy life is this,—to
rejoice unto Thee, in Thee, and for Thee; this it is, and there is no
other. <span id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) But those who think there
is another follow after another joy, and that not the true one. Their
will, however, is not turned away from some shadow of joy.

good,” as he remarks in his *De Civ. Dei*, xix. 4. Compare also *ibid.*
viii. sec. 8, where he argues that the highest good is God, and that he
who loves Him is in the enjoyment of that good. See also note on the
chief good, p. 75, above.
