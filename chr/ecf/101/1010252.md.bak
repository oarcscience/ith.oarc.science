id="vi.XII.XIX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—He Enumerates the Things
Concerning Which All Agree.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XIX-p2"></span>28. For it is true, O Lord, that Thou
hast made heaven and earth; it is also true, that the Beginning is Thy
Wisdom, in Which Thou hast made all things. <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) It is likewise true, that this
visible world hath its own great parts, the heaven and the earth, which
in a short compass comprehends all made and created natures. It is also
true, that everything mutable sets before our minds a certain want of
form, whereof it taketh a form, or is changed and turned. It is true,
that that is subject to no times which so cleaveth to the changeless
form as that, though it be mutable, it is not changed. It is true, that
the formlessness, which is almost nothing, cannot have changes, of
times. It is true, that that of which anything is made may by a certain
mode of speech be called by the name of that thing which is made of it;
whence that formlessness of which heaven and earth were made might it be
called “heaven and earth.” It is true, that of all things having form,
nothing is nearer to the formless than the earth and the deep. It is
true, that not only every created, and formed thing, but also whatever
is capable of creation and of form, Thou hast made, “by whom are all
things.” <span id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md) It is true, that
everything that is formed from that which is formless was formless
before it was formed.
