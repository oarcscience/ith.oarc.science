Measured While It is Passing.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XVI-p2"></span>21. And yet, O Lord, we perceive
intervals of times, and we compare them with themselves, and we say some
are longer, others shorter. We even measure by how much shorter or
longer this time may be than that; and we answer, “That this is double
or treble, while that is but once, or only as much as that.” But we
measure times passing when we measure them by perceiving them; but past
times, which now are not, or future times, which as yet are not, who can
measure them? Unless, perchance, any one will dare to say, that that can
be measured which is not. When, therefore, time is passing, it can be
perceived and measured; but when it has passed, it cannot, since it is
not.
