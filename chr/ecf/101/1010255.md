<span id="vi.XII.XXII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XXII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—He Discusses Whether Matter
Was from Eternity, or Was Made by God. <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) </span>

<span id="vi.XII.XXII-p3"></span>31. For, should any one endeavour to
contend against these last two opinions, thus,—“If you will not admit
that this formlessness of matter appears to be called by the name of
heaven and earth, then there was something which God had not made out of
which He could make heaven and earth; for Scripture hath not told us
that God made this matter, unless we understand it to be implied in the
term of heaven and earth, or of earth only, when it is said, ‘In the
beginning God created heaven and earth,’ as that which follows, but the
earth was invisible and formless, although it was pleasing to him so to
call the formless matter, we may not yet understand any but that which
God made in that text which hath been already written, ‘God made heaven
and earth.’” The maintainers of either one or the other of these two
opinions which we have put last will, when they have heard these things,
answer and say, “We deny not indeed that this formless matter was
created by God, the God of whom are all things, very good; for, as we
say that that is a greater good which is created and formed, so we
acknowledge that that is a minor good which is capable of creation and
form, but yet good. But yet the Scripture hath not declared that God
made this formlessness, any more than it hath declared many other
things; as the ‘Cherubim,’ and ‘Seraphim,’ <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md) and those of which the apostle
distinctly speaks, ‘Thrones,’ ‘Dominions,’ ‘Principalities,’
‘Powers,’ <span id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141.md) all of which it is
manifest God made. Or if in that which is said, ‘He made heaven and
earth,’ all things are comprehended, what do we say of the waters upon
which the Spirit of God moved? For if they are understood as
incorporated in the word earth, how then can formless matter be meant in
the term earth when we see the waters so beautiful? Or if it be so
meant, why then is it written that out of the same formlessness the
firmament was made and called heaven, and yet it is not written that the
waters were made? For those waters, which we perceive flowing in so
beautiful a manner, remain not formless and invisible. But if, then,
they received that beauty when God said, Let the water which is under
the firmament be gathered together, <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142.md) so that the gathering be the very
formation, what will be answered concerning the waters which are above
the firmament, because if formless they would not have deserved to
receive a seat so honourable, nor is it written by what word they were
formed? If, then, Genesis is silent as to anything that God has made,
which, however, neither sound faith nor unerring understanding doubteth
that God hath made, <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md) let not
any sober teaching dare to say that these waters were co-eternal with
God because we find them mentioned in the book of Genesis; but when they
were created, we find not. Why—truth instructing us—may we not
understand that that formless matter, which the Scripture calls the
earth invisible and without form, and the darksome deep, <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md) have been made <span
id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span id="vi.XII.XXII-Page_185"></span>by
God out of nothing, and therefore that they are not co-eternal with Him,
although that narrative hath failed to tell when they were made?”
