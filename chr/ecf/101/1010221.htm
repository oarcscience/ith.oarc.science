<p class="c50"><a name="vi.XI.XX-p2"></A>26. But what now is manifest and clear is, that neither are there future nor past things. Nor is it fitly said, &#8220;There are three times, past, present and future;&#8221; but perchance it might be fitly said, &#8220;There are three times; a present of things past, a present of things present, and a present of things future.&#8221; For these three do somehow exist in the soul, and otherwise I see them not: present of things past, memory; present of things present, sight; present of things future, expectation. If of these things we are permitted to speak, I see three times, and I grant there are three. It may also be said, &#8220;There are three times, past, present and future,&#8221; as usage falsely has it. See, I trouble not, nor gainsay, nor reprove; provided always that which is said may be understood, that neither the future, nor that which is past, now is. For there are but few things which we speak properly, many things improperly; but what we may wish to say is understood.</p>
