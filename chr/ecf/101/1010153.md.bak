<span id="vi.IX.X-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IX.X-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—A Conversation He Had with His
Mother Concerning the Kingdom of Heaven.</span>

<span id="vi.IX.X-p2"></span>23. As the day now approached on which she
was to depart this life (which day Thou knewest, we did not), it fell
out—Thou, as I believe, by Thy secret ways arranging it—that she and I
stood alone, leaning in a certain window, from which the garden of the
house we occupied at Ostia could be seen; at which place, removed from
the crowd, we were resting ourselves for the voyage, after the fatigues
of a long journey. We then were conversing alone very pleasantly; and,
“forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those
things which are before,” <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) we
were seeking between ourselves in the presence of the Truth, which Thou
art, of what nature the eternal life of the saints would be, which eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of
man. <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) But yet we opened wide the
mouth of our heart, after those supernal streams of Thy fountain, “the
fountain of life,” which is “with Thee;” <span
id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) that being sprinkled with it according
to our capacity, we might in some measure weigh so high a mystery.

<span id="vi.IX.X-p6"></span>24. And when our conversation had arrived
at that point, that the very highest pleasure of the carnal senses, and
that in the very brightest material light, seemed by reason of the
sweetness of that life not only not worthy of comparison, but not even
of mention, we, lifting ourselves with a more ardent affection towards
“the Selfsame,” <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) did gradually
pass through all corporeal things, and even the heaven itself, whence
sun, and moon, and stars shine upon the earth; yea, we soared higher yet
by inward musing, and discoursing, and admiring Thy works; and we came
to our own minds, and went beyond them, that we might advance as high as
that region of unfailing plenty, where Thou feedest Israel <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) for ever with the food of truth, and
where life is that Wisdom by whom all these things are made, both which
have been, and which are to come; and she is not made, but is as she
hath been, and so shall ever be; yea, rather, to “have been,” and “to be
hereafter,” are not in her, but only “to be,” seeing she is eternal, for
to “have been” and “to be hereafter” are not eternal. And while we were
thus speaking, and straining after her, we slightly touched her with the
whole effort of our heart; and we sighed, and there left bound “the
first-fruits of the Spirit;” <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) and
returned to the noise of our own mouth, where the word uttered has both
beginning and end. And what is like unto Thy Word, our Lord, who
remaineth in Himself without becoming old, and “maketh all things
new”? <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md)

<span id="vi.IX.X-p11"></span>25. We were saying, then, If to any man
the tumult of the flesh were silenced,—silenced the phantasies of earth,
waters, and air,—silenced, too, the poles; yea, the very soul be
silenced to herself, and go beyond herself by not think<span
id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span id="vi.IX.X-Page_138"></span>ing of
herself,—silenced fancies and imaginary revelations, every tongue, and
every sign, and whatsoever exists by passing away, since, if any could
hearken, all these say, “We created not ourselves, but were created by
Him who abideth for ever:” If, having uttered this, they now should be
silenced, having only quickened our ears to Him who created them, and He
alone speak not by them, but by Himself, that we may hear His word, not
by fleshly tongue, nor angelic voice, nor sound of thunder, nor the
obscurity of a similitude, but might hear Him—Him whom in these we
love—without these, like as we two now strained ourselves, and with
rapid thought touched on that Eternal Wisdom which remaineth over all.
If this could be sustained, and other visions of a far different kind be
withdrawn, and this one ravish, and absorb, and envelope its beholder
amid these inward joys, so that his life might be eternally like that
one moment of knowledge which we now sighed after, were not this “Enter
thou into the joy of Thy Lord”? <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md)
And when shall that be? When we shall all rise again; but all shall not
be changed. <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md)

<span id="vi.IX.X-p14"></span>26. Such things was I saying; and if not
after this manner, and in these words, yet, Lord, Thou knowest, that in
that day when we were talking thus, this world with all its delights
grew contemptible to us, even while we spake. Then said my mother, “Son,
for myself, I have no longer any pleasure in aught in this life. What I
want here further, and why I am here, I know not, now that my hopes in
this world are satisfied. There was indeed one thing for which I wished
to tarry a little in this life, and that was that I might see thee a
Catholic Christian before I died. <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) My God has exceeded this abundantly,
so that I see thee despising all earthly felicity, made His
servant,—what do I here?”

<span id="vi.IX.X-p15"></span> Dean Stanley (*Canterbury Sermons*, serm.
10) draws the following, amongst other lessons, from God’s dealings with
Augustin. “It is an example,” he says, “like the conversion of St. Paul,
of the fact that from time to time God calls His servants not by
gradual, but by sudden changes. These conversions are, it is true, the
exceptions and not the rule of Providence, but such examples as Augustin
show us that we must acknowledge the truth of the exceptions when they
do occur. It is also an instance how, even in such sudden conversions,
previous good influences have their weight. The prayers of his mother,
the silent influence of his friend, the high character of Ambrose, the
preparation for Christian truth in the writings of heathen philosophers,
were all laid up, as it were, waiting for the spark, and, when it came,
the fire flashed at once through every corner of his soul.”
