Mathematical.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XII-p2"></span>19. The memory containeth also the reasons
and innumerable laws of numbers and dimensions, none of which hath any
sense of the body impressed, seeing they have neither colour, nor sound,
nor taste, nor smell, nor sense of touch. I have heard the sound of the
words by which these things are signified when they are discussed; but
the sounds are one thing, the things another. For the sounds are one
thing in Greek, another in Latin; but the things themselves are neither
Greek, nor Latin, nor any other language. I have seen the lines of the
craftsmen, even the finest, like a spider’s web; but these are of
another kind, they are not the images of those which the eye of my flesh
showed me; he knoweth them who, without any idea whatsoever of a body,
perceives them within himself. I have also observed the numbers of the
things with which we number all the senses of the body; but those by
which we number are of another kind, nor are they the images of these,
and therefore they certainly are. Let him who sees not these things mock
me for saying them; and I will pity him, whilst he mocks me.
