<span id="vi.VII.X-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VII.X-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Divine Things are the More Clearly
Manifested to Him Who Withdraws into the Recesses of His Heart.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.X-p2"></span>16. And being thence warned to return to
myself, I entered into my inward self, Thou leading me on; and I was
able to do it, for Thou wert become my helper. And I entered, and with
the eye of my soul (such as it was) saw above the same eye of my soul,
above my mind, the Unchangeable Light. <span
id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) Not this common light, which all flesh
may look upon, nor, as it were, a greater one of the same kind, as
though the brightness of this should be much more resplendent, and with
its greatness fill up all things. Not like this was that light, but
different, yea, very different from all these. Nor was it above my mind
as oil is above water, nor as heaven above earth; but above it was,
because it made me, and I below it, because I was made by it. He who
knows the Truth knows that Light; and he that knows it knoweth eternity.
Love knoweth it. O Eternal Truth, and true Love, and loved
Eternity! <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) Thou art my God; to
Thee do I sigh both night and day. When I first knew Thee, Thou liftedst
me up, that I might see there was that which I might see, and that yet
it was not I that did see. And Thou didst beat back the infirmity of my
sight, pouring forth upon me most strongly Thy beams of light, and I
trembled with love and fear; and I found myself to be far off from Thee,
in the region of dissimilarity, as if I heard this voice of Thine from
on high: “I am the food of strong men; grow, and thou shalt feed upon
me; nor shall thou convert me, like the food of thy flesh, into thee,
but thou shall be converted into me.” And I learned that Thou for
iniquity dost correct man, and Thou dost make my soul to consume away
like a spider. <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) And I said, “Is
Truth, therefore, nothing because it is neither diffused through space,
finite, nor infinite?” And Thou criedst to me from afar, “Yea, verily,
‘<span class="c9"><span id="vi.VII.X-p5.2"></span>I Am that I
Am.</span>’” <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) And I heard this,
as things <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="vi.VII.X-Page_110"></span>are heard in the heart, nor was there room
for doubt; and I should more readily doubt that I live than that Truth
is not, which is “clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made.” <span id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md)

<span id="vi.VII.X-p3"></span> Not the “corporeal brightness” which as a
Manichee he had believed in, and to which reference has been made in
iii. secs. 10, 12, iv. sec. 3, and sec. 2, above. The Christian belief
he indicates in his *De Trin.* viii. 2: “God is Light ([1 John
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)<span id="vi.VII.X-p3.1"></span>.md),
not in such way that these eyes see, but in such way as the heart sees
when it is said, ‘He is Truth.’” See also note 1, sec. 23, above.

<span id="vi.VII.X-p4"></span> If we knew not God, he says, we could not
love Him (*De Trin.* viii. 12); but in language very similar to that
above, he tells us “we are men, created in the image of our Creator,
whose eternity is true, and whose truth is eternal; whose love is
eternal and true, and who Himself is the eternal, true, and adorable
Trinity, without confusion, without separation”, (*De Civ. Dei*, xi.
28); God, then, as even the Platonists hold, being the principle of all
knowledge. “Let Him,” he concludes, in his *De Civ. Dei* (viii. 4), “be
sought in whom all things are secured to us, let Him be discovered in
whom all truth becomes certain to us, let Him be loved in whom all
becomes right to us.”

Augustin, when in his *De Civ. Dei* (viii. 11, 12) he makes reference to
this text, leans to the belief, from certain parallels between Plato’s
doctrines and those of the word of God, that he may have derived
information concerning the Old Testament Scriptures from an interpreter
when in Egypt. He says: “The most striking thing in this connection, and
that which most of all inclines me almost to assent to the opinion that
Plato was not ignorant of those writings, is the answer which was given
to the question elicited from the holy Moses when the words of God were
conveyed to him by the angel; for when he asked what was the name of
that God who was commanding him to go and deliver the Hebrew people out
of Egypt, this answer was given: ‘I am who am; and thou shalt say to the
children of Israel, He who *is* sent me unto you;’ as though, compared
with Him that truly *is*, because He is unchangeable, those things which
have been created mutable *are* not,—a truth which Plato vehemently
held, and most diligently commended. And I know not whether this
sentiment is anywhere to be found in the books of those who were before
Plato, unless in that book where it is said, ‘I am who am; and thou
shalt say to the children of Israel, *Who is* sent me unto you.’ But we
need not determine from what source he learned these things,—whether it
was from the books of the ancients who preceded him or, as is more
likely, from the words of the apostle ([Rom.
1.20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020)<span id="vi.VII.X-p6.2"></span>.md),
‘Because that which is known of God has been manifested among them, for
God hath manifested it to them. For His invisible things from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by those thing
which have been made, also His eternal power and Godhead.’”—*De Civ.
Dei*, viii. 11, 12.
