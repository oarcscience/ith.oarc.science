<span id="vi.IV.IX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IV.IX-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—That the Love of a Human Being,
However Constant in Loving and Returning Love, Perishes; While He Who
Loves God Never Loses a Friend.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.IX-p2"></span>14. This is it that is loved in friends;
and so loved that a man’s conscience accuses itself if he love not him
by whom he is beloved, or love not again him that loves him, expecting
nothing from him but indications of his love. Hence that mourning if one
die, and gloom of sorrow, that steeping of the heart in tears, all
sweetness turned into bitterness, and upon the loss of the life of the
dying, the death of the living. Blessed be he who loveth Thee, and his
friend in Thee, and his enemy for Thy sake. For he alone loses none dear
to him to whom all are dear in Him who cannot be lost. And who is this
but our God, the God that created heaven and earth, <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) and filleth them, <span
id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) because by filling them He created
them? <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) None loseth Thee but he
who leaveth Thee. And he who leaveth Thee, whither goeth he, or whither
fleeth he, but from Thee well pleased to Thee angry? For where doth not
he find Thy law in his own punishment? “And Thy law is the truth,” <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) and truth Thou. <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md)
