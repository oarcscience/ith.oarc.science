id="vi.XI.XIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Neither Time Past Nor Future,
But the Present Only, Really is.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XIV-p2"></span>17. At no time, therefore, hadst Thou not
made anything, because Thou hadst made time itself. And no times are
co-eternal with Thee, because Thou remainest for ever; but should these
continue, they would not be times. For what is time? Who can easily and
briefly explain it? Who even in thought can comprehend it, even to the
pronouncing of a word concerning it? But what in speaking do we refer to
more familiarly and knowingly than time? And certainly we understand
when we speak of it; we understand also when we hear it spoken of by
another. What, then, is time? If no one ask of me, I know; if I wish to
explain to him who asks, I know not. Yet I say with confidence, that I
know that if nothing passed away, there would not be past time; and if
nothing were coming, there would not be future time; and if nothing
were, there would not be present time. Those two times, therefore, past
and future, how are they, when even the past now is not; and the future
is not as yet? But should the present be always present, and should it
not pass into time past, time truly it could not be, but eternity. If,
then, time present—if it be time—only comes into existence because it
passes into time past, how do we say that even this is, whose cause of
being is that it shall not be—namely, so that we cannot truly say that
time is, unless because it tends not to be?
