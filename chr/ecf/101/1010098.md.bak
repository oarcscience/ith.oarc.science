<span id="vi.VI.VII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VI.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—He Leads to Reformation His
Friend Alypius, Seized with Madness for the Circensian Games.</span>

<span id="vi.VI.VII-p2"></span>11. These things we, who lived like
friends together, jointly deplored, but chiefly and most familiarly did
I discuss them with Alypius and Nebridius, of whom Alypius was born in
the same town as myself, his parents being of the highest rank there,
but he being younger than I. For he had studied under me, first, when I
taught in our own town, and afterwards at Carthage, and esteemed me
highly, because I appeared to him good and learned; and I esteemed him
for his innate love of virtue, which, in one of no great age, was
sufficiently eminent. But the vortex of Carthaginian customs (amongst
whom these frivolous spectacles are hotly followed) had inveigled him
into the madness of the Circensian games. But while he was miserably
tossed about therein, I was professing rhetoric there, and had a public
school. As yet he did not give ear to my teaching, on account of some
ill-feeling that had arisen between me and his father. I had then found
how fatally he doted upon the circus, and was deeply grieved that he
seemed likely—if, indeed, he had not already done so—to cast away his so
great promise. Yet had I no means of advising, or by a sort of restraint
reclaiming him, either by the kindness of a friend or by the authority
of a master. For I imagined that his sentiments towards me were the same
as his father’s; but he was not such. Disregarding, therefore, his
father’s will in that matter, he commenced to salute me, and, coming
into my lecture-room, to listen for a little and depart.

<span id="vi.VI.VII-p3"></span>12. But it slipped my memory to deal with
him, so that he should not, through a blind and headstrong desire of
empty pastimes, undo so great a wit. But Thou, O Lord, who governest the
helm of all Thou hast created, hadst not forgotten him, who was one day
to be amongst Thy sons, the President of Thy sacrament; <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) <span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span
id="vi.VI.VII-Page_95"></span>and that his amendment might plainly be
attributed to Thyself, Thou broughtest it about through me, but I
knowing nothing of it. For one day, when I was sitting in my accustomed
place, with my scholars before me, he came in, saluted me, sat himself
down, and fixed his attention on the subject I was then handling. It so
happened that I had a passage in hand, which while I was explaining, a
simile borrowed from the Circensian games occurred to me, as likely to
make what I wished to convey pleasanter and plainer, imbued with a
biting jibe at those whom that madness had enthralled. Thou knowest, O
our God, that I had no thought at that time of curing Alypius of that
plague. But he took it to himself, and thought that I would not have
said it but for his sake. And what any other man would have made a
ground of offence against me, this worthy young man took as a reason for
being offended at himself, and for loving me more fervently. For Thou
hast said it long ago, and written in Thy book, “Rebuke a wise man, and
he will love thee.” <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) But I had
not rebuked him, but Thou, who makest use of all consciously or
unconsciously, in that order which Thyself knowest (and that order is
right), wroughtest out of my heart and tongue burning coals, by which
Thou mightest set on fire and cure the hopeful mind thus languishing.
Let him be silent in Thy praises who meditates not on Thy mercies, which
from my inmost parts confess unto Thee. For he upon that speech rushed
out from that so deep pit, wherein he was wilfully plunged, and was
blinded by its miserable pastimes; and he roused his mind with a
resolute moderation; whereupon all the filth of the Circensian
pastimes <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) flew off from him, and
he did not approach them further. Upon this, he prevailed with his
reluctant father to let him be my pupil. He gave in and consented. And
Alypius, beginning again to hear me, was involved in the same
superstition as I was, loving in the Manichæans that ostentation of
continency <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) which he believed to
be true and unfeigned. It was, however, a senseless and seducing
continency, ensnaring precious souls, not able as yet to reach the
height of virtue, and easily beguiled with the veneer of what was but a
shadowy and feigned virtue.

<span id="vi.VI.VII-p6"></span> The games in the Provinces of the empire
were on the same model as those held in the Circus Maximus at Rome,
though not so imposing. This circus was one of those vast works executed
by Tarquinius Priscus. Hardly a vestige of it at the present time
remains, though the Cloaca Maxima, another of his stupendous works, has
not, after more than 2500 years, a stone displaced, and still performs
its appointed service of draining the city of Rome into the Tiber. In
the circus were exhibited chariot and foot races, fights on horseback,
representations of battles (on which occasion camps were pitched in the
circus), and the Grecian athletic sports introduced after the conquest
of that country. See also sec. 13, note, below.

<span id="vi.VI.VII-p7"></span> Augustin, in book v. sec. 9, above,
refers to the reputed sanctity of Manichæus, and it may well be
questioned whether the sect deserved that unmitigated reprobation he
pours out upon them in his *De Moribus*, and in parts of his controversy
with Faustus. Certain it is that Faustus laid claim, on behalf of his
sect, to a very different moral character to that Augustin would impute
to them. He says (*Con. Faust.* v. 1): “Do I believe the gospel? You ask
me if I believe it, though my obedience to its commands shows that I do.
I should rather ask you if you believe it, since you give no proof of
your belief. I have left my father, mother, wife, and children, and all
else that the Gospel requires ([Matt.
19.29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.VI.VII-p7.1"></span>); and do you ask if I believe the gospel?
Perhaps you do not know what is called the gospel. The gospel is nothing
else than the preaching and the precept of Christ. I have parted with
all gold and silver, and have left off carrying money in my purse;
content with daily food; without anxiety for to-morrow; and without
solicitude about how I shall be fed, or wherewithal I shall be clothed:
and do you ask if I believe the gospel? You see in me the blessings of
the gospel ([Matt. 5.3-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.VI.VII-p7.2"></span>); and do you ask if I believe the gospel?
You see me poor, meek, a peacemaker, pure in heart, mourning, hungering,
thirsting, bearing persecutions and enmity for righteousness’ sake; and
do you doubt my belief in the gospel?” It is difficult to understand
that Manichæanism can have spread as largely as it did at that time, if
the asceticism of many amongst them had not been real. It may be noted
that in his controversy with Fortunatus, Augustin strangely declines to
discuss the charges of immorality that had been brought against the
Manichæans; and in the last

<span id="vi.VI.VII-p8"></span>Chapter of his *De Moribus*, it appears
to be indicated that one, if not more, of those whose evil deeds are
there spoken of had a desire to follow the rule of life laid down by
Manichæus.
