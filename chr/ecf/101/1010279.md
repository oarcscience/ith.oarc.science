<span id="vi.XIII.XIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—That the Renewal of Man is
Not Completed in This World.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XIII-p2"></span>14. But as yet “by faith, not by
sight,” <span id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) for “we are saved by
hope; but hope that is seen is not hope.” <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) As yet deep calleth unto deep <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md) but in “the noise of Thy
waterspouts.” <span id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) And as yet doth
he that saith, I “could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as
unto carnal,” <span id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) even he, as
yet, doth not count himself to have apprehended, and forgetteth those
things which are behind, and reacheth forth to those things which are
before, <span id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md) and groaneth being
burdened; <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) and his soul
thirsteth after the living God, as the hart after the water-brooks, and
saith, “When shall I come?” <span id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md)
“desiring to be clothed upon with his house which is from heaven;” <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) and calleth upon this lower deep,
saying, “Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind.” <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) And,
“Be not children in understanding, howbeit in malice be ye children,”
that in “understanding ye may be perfect;” <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) and “O foolish Galatians, who hath
bewitched you?” <span id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) But now not
in his own voice, but in Thine who sentest Thy Spirit from above; <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) through Him who “ascended up on
high,” <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) and set open the
flood-gates of His gifts, <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md)
that the force of His streams might make glad the city of God. <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md) For, for Him doth “the friend of
the bridegroom” <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md) sigh, having
now the first-fruits of the Spirit laid up with Him, yet still groaning
within himself, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of his
body; <span id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) to Him he sighs, for he
is a member of the Bride; for Him is he jealous, for he is the friend of
the Bridegroom; <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md) for Him is he
jealous, not for himself; because in the voice of Thy
“waterspouts,” <span id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) not in his own
voice, doth he call on that other deep, for whom being jealous he
feareth, lest that, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so
their minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in our
Bridegroom, Thine only Son. <span id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md)
What a light of beauty will that be when “we shall see Him as He
is,” <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238.md) and those tears be
passed away <span id="page_195">p. 195</span> <span
id="vi.XIII.XIII-Page_195"></span>which “have been my meat day and
night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?” <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239.md)

the majority of Patristic commentators), *in Ps.* xli. 8, sec. 13, to be
the heart of man; and the “deep” that calls unto it, is the preacher who
has his own “deep” of infirmity, even as Peter had.
