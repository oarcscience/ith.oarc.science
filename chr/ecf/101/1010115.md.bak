<span id="vi.VII.VII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VII.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—He is Severely Exercised as to
the Origin of Evil.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.VII-p2"></span>11. And now, O my Helper, hadst Thou
freed me from those fetters; and I inquired, “Whence is evil?” and found
no result. But Thou sufferedst me not to be carried away from the faith
by any fluctuations of thought, whereby I believed Thee both to exist,
and Thy substance to be unchangeable, and that Thou hadst a care of and
wouldest judge men; and that in Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, and the Holy
Scriptures, which the authority of Thy Catholic Church pressed upon me,
Thou hadst planned the way of man’s salvation to that life which is to
come after this death. These things being safe and immoveably settled in
my mind, I eagerly inquired, “Whence is evil?” What torments did my
travailing heart then endure! What sighs, O my God! Yet even there were
Thine ears open, and I knew it not; and when in stillness I sought
earnestly, those silent contritions of my soul were strong cries unto
Thy mercy. No man knoweth, but only Thou, what I endured. For what was
that which was thence through my tongue poured into the ears of my most
familiar friends? Did the whole tumult of my soul, for which neither
time nor speech was sufficient, reach them? Yet went the whole into
Thine ears, all of which I bellowed out from the sightings of my heart;
and my desire was before Thee, and the light of mine eyes was not with
me; <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) for that was within, I
without. Nor was that in place, but my attention was directed to things
contained in place; but there did I find no resting-place, nor did they
receive me in such a way as that I could say, “It is <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span
id="vi.VII.VII-Page_107"></span>sufficient, it is well;” nor did they
let me turn back, where it might be well enough with me. For to these
things was I superior, but inferior to Thee; and Thou art my true joy
when I am subjected to Thee, and Thou hadst subjected to me what Thou
createdst beneath me. <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) And this
was the true temperature and middle region of my safety, to continue in
Thine image, and by serving Thee to have dominion over the body. But
when I lifted myself proudly against Thee, and “ran against the Lord,
even on His neck, with the thick bosses” of my buckler, <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) even these inferior things were placed
above me, and pressed upon me, and nowhere was there alleviation or
breathing space. They encountered my sight on every side in crowds and
troops, and in thought the images of bodies obtruded themselves as I was
returning to Thee, as if they would say unto me, “Whither goest thou,
unworthy and base one?” And these things had sprung forth out of my
wound; for thou humblest the proud like one that is wounded, <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) and through my own swelling was I
separated from Thee; yea, my too much swollen face closed up mine eyes.

<span id="vi.VII.VII-p4"></span> Man can only control the forces of
nature by yielding obedience to nature’s laws; and our true joy and
safety is only to be found being “subjected” to God. So Augustin says in
another place, (*De Trin.* x. 7), the soul is enjoined to know itself,
“in order that it may consider itself, and live according to its own
nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz.
under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to
which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled,
above those things which it ought to rule.”
