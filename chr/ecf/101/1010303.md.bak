Worketh, and Yet is Ever at Rest.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXVII-p2"></span>52. For even then shalt Thou so rest
in us, as now Thou dost work in us; and thus shall that be Thy rest
through us, as these are Thy works through us. <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) But Thou, O Lord, ever workest, and
art ever at rest. Nor seest Thou in time, nor movest Thou in time, nor
restest Thou in time; and yet Thou makest the scenes of time, and the
times themselves, and the rest which results from time.

9: “For as God is properly said to do what we do when He works in us, so
is God properly said to rest when by His gift we rest.”
