id="vi.IV.VIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—That His Grief Ceased by Time,
and the Consolation of Friends.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.VIII-p2"></span>13. Times lose no time, nor do they idly
roll through our senses. They work strange operations on the mind. <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) Behold, they came and went from day to
day, and by coming and going they disseminated in my mind other ideas
and other remembrances, and by little and little patched me up again
with the former kind of delights, unto which that sorrow of mine
yielded. But yet there succeeded, not certainly other sorrows, yet the
causes of other sorrows. <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) For
whence had that former sorrow so easily penetrated to the quick, but
that I had poured out my soul upon the dust, in loving one who must die
as if he were never to die? But what revived and refreshed me especially
was the consolations of other friends, <span
id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) with whom I did love what instead of
Thee I loved. And this was a monstrous fable and protracted lie, by
whose adulterous contact our soul, which lay itching in our ears, was
being polluted. But that fable would not die to me so oft as any of my
friends died. There were other things in them which did more lay hold of
my mind,—to discourse and jest with them; to indulge in an interchange
of kindnesses; to read together pleasant books; together to trifle, and
together to be earnest; to differ at times without ill-humour, as a man
would do with his own self; and even by the infrequency of these
differences to give zest to our more frequent consentings; sometimes
teaching, sometimes being taught; longing for the absent with
impatience, and welcoming the coming with joy. These and similar
expressions, emanating from the hearts of those who loved and were
beloved in return, by the countenance, the tongue, the eyes, and a
thousand pleasing movements, were so much fuel to melt our souls
together, and out of many to make but one.

<span id="vi.IV.VIII-p5"></span> “Friendship,” says Lord Bacon, in his
essay thereon,—the sentiment being perhaps suggested by Cicero’s
“Secundas res splendidiores facit amicitia et adversas partiens
communicansque leviores” (*De Amicit*. 6),—“redoubleth joys, and cutteth
griefs in halves.” Augustin appears to have been eminently open to
influences of this kind. In his *De Duab. Anim. con. Manich.* (c. ix.)
he tells us that friendship was one of the bonds that kept him in the
ranks of the Manichæans; and here we find that, aided by time and
weeping, it restored him in his great grief. See also v. sec. 19, and
vi. sec 26, below.
