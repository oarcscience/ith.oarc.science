<span id="vi.X.XLIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XLIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.—That Jesus Christ, at the
Same Time God and Man, is the True and Most Efficacious Mediator.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XLIII-p2"></span>68. But the true Mediator, whom in Thy
secret mercy Thou hast pointed out to the humble, and didst send, that
by His example <span id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976) also they might
learn the same humility—that “Mediator between God and men, the man
Christ Jesus,” <span id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977) appeared between
mortal sinners and the immortal Just One—mortal with men, just with God;
that because the reward of righteousness is life and peace, He might, by
righteousness conjoined with God, cancel the death of justified sinners,
which He willed to have in common with them. <span
id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978) Hence He was pointed out to holy men
of old; to the intent that they, through faith in His Passion to
come, <span id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979) even as we through faith
in that which is past, might be saved. For as man He was Mediator; but
as the Word He was not between, <span id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980)
because equal to God, and God with God, and together with the Holy
Spirit <span id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981) one God.

<span id="vi.X.XLIII-p9"></span>69. How hast Thou loved us, <span
id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982) O good Father, who sparedst not Thine
only Son, but deliveredst Him up for us wicked ones! <span
id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983) How hast Thou loved us, for whom He,
who thought it no robbery to be equal with Thee, “became obedient unto
death, even the death of the cross;” <span
id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984) He alone “free among the dead,” <span
id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985) that had power to lay down His life,
and power to take it again; <span id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986) for
us was He unto Thee both Victor and Victim, and the Victor as being the
Victim; for us was He unto Thee both Priest and Sacrifice, and Priest as
being the Sacrifice; of slaves making us Thy sons, by being born of
Thee, and serving us. Rightly, then, is my hope strongly fixed on Him,
that Thou wilt heal all my diseases <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987) by Him who sitteth at Thy right hand
and maketh intercession for us; <span id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988)
else should I utterly despair. <span id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989)
For numerous and great are my infirmities, yea, numerous and great are
they; but Thy medicine is greater. We might think that Thy Word was
removed from union with man, and despair of ourselves had He not been
“made flesh and dwelt among us.” <span id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990)

<span id="vi.X.XLIII-p19"></span>70. Terrified by my sins and the load
of my misery, I had resolved in my heart, and meditated flight into the
wilderness; <span id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991) but Thou didst
forbid me, and didst strengthen me, saying, therefore, Christ “died for
all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,
but unto Him which died for them.” <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992) Behold, O Lord, I cast my care upon
Thee, <span id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993) that I may live, and
“behold wondrous things out of Thy law.” <span
id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994) Thou knowest my unskilfulness and my
infirmities; teach me, and heal me. Thine only Son—He “in whom are hid
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” <span
id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995) —hath redeemed me with His blood. Let
not the proud speak evil of me, <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996)
because I consider my ransom, and eat and drink, and distribute; and
poor, desire to be satisfied from Him, together with those who eat and
are satisfied, and they praise the Lord that seek him. <span

id="vi.X.XLIII-p4.2"></span>

<span id="vi.X.XLIII-p5"></span> Not that our Lord is to be supposed, as
some have held, to have been under the law of death in Adam, because “in
Adam all die” ([1 Cor. 15.22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022)<span
id="vi.X.XLIII-p5.1"></span>; see the whole of c. 23, in *De* *Civ.
Dei*, xiii, and compare ix. sec. 34, note 3, above); for he says in
*Serm.* ccxxxii. 5: “As there was nothing in us from which life could
spring, so there was nothing in Him from which death could come.” He
*laid down* His life ([John 10.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018)<span
id="vi.X.XLIII-p5.2"></span>), and as being partaker of the divine
nature, could *see no corruption* ([Acts
2.27](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027)<span
id="vi.X.XLIII-p5.3"></span>). This is the explanation Augustin gives in
his comment on [Ps. 85.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#005)<span
id="vi.X.XLIII-p5.4"></span> (quoted in the next section) of Christ’s
being “free among the dead.” So also in his *De Trin.* xiii. 18, he says
he was thus free because “solus enim a debito mortis liber est mortuus.”
The true analogy between the first and second Adam is surely then to be
found in our Lord’s being free from the law of death by reason of His
divine nature, and Adam before his transgression being able to avert
death by partaking of the Tree of Life. Christ was, it is true, a child
of Adam, but a child of Adam miraculously born. See note 3, p. 73,
above.

id="vi.X.XLIII-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.X.XLIII-p10"></span> Christ did not, as in the words of a
well-known hymn, “change the wrath to love.” For, as Augustin remarks in
a very beautiful passage *in Ev. Joh. Tract.* cx. 6, God loved us before
the foundation of the world, and the reconcilement wrought by Christ
must not be “so understood as if the Son reconciled us unto Him in this
respect, that He now began to love those *whom He formerly hated*, in
the same way as enemy is reconciled to enemy, so that thereafter they
become friends, and mutual love takes the place of their mutual hatred;
but we were reconciled unto Him who *already loved us*, but with whom we
were at enmity because of our sin. Whether I say the truth on this let
the apostle testify, when he says: ‘God commendeth His love towards us,
in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us’” ([Rom.
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009)<span
id="vi.X.XLIII-p10.1"></span>). He similarly applies the text last
quoted in his *De Trin.* xiii. 15. See also *ibid.* sec. 21, where he
speaks of the wrath of God, and *ibid.* iv. 2. Compare Archbishop
Thomson, *Bampton Lectures*, lect. vii., and note 95.

8.34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034)<span
id="vi.X.XLIII-p11.1"></span>, which is not “for us wicked ones,” but
“for us all,” as the Authorized Version has it; and we must not narrow
the words. Augustin, *in Ev. Joh. Tract.* cx. 2, it will be remembered,
when commenting on [John 17.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021)<span
id="vi.X.XLIII-p11.2"></span>, “that they all may be one…that the world
may believe Thou hast sent me,” limits “the world” to the *believing
world*, and continues (*ibid.*sec. 4), “Ipsi sunt enim mundus, non
permanens inimicus, qualis est mundis damnationi prædestinatus.” On
Christ being a ransom for *all*, see Archbishop Thomson, *Bampton
Lectures*, lect. vii. part 5, and note 101.

the spiritual pride of the Donatists, who, holding rigid views as to
purity of discipline, disparaged both his life and doctrine, pointing to
his Manichæanism and the sinfulness of life before baptism. In his
*Answer to Petilian*, iii. 11, 20, etc., and *Serm.* 3, sec. 19, on [Ps.
36](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#000)<span
