<span id="vi.IV.XVI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IV.XVI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—He Very Easily Understood the
Liberal Arts and the Categories of Aristotle, But Without True
Fruit.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.XVI-p2"></span>28. And what did it profit me that, when
scarce twenty years old, a book of Aristotle’s, entitled *The Ten
Predicaments*, fell into my hands,—on whose very name I hung as on
something great and divine, when my rhetoric master of Carthage, and
others who were esteemed learned, referred to it with cheeks swelling
with pride,—I read it alone and understood it? And on my conferring with
others, who said that with the assistance of very able masters—who not
only explained it orally, but drew many things in the dust <span
id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) —they scarcely understood it, and
could tell me no more about it than I had acquired in reading it by
myself alone? And the book appeared to me to speak plainly enough of
substances, such as man is, and of their qualities,—such as the figure
of a man, of what kind it is; and his stature, how many feet high; and
his relationship, whose brother he is; or where placed, or when born; or
whether he stands or sits, or is shod or armed, or does or suffers
anything; and whatever innumerable things might be classed under these
nine categories, <span id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) —of which I
have given some examples,—or under that chief category of substance.

<span id="vi.IV.XVI-p5"></span>29. What did all this profit me, seeing
it even hindered me, when, imagining that whatsoever existed was
comprehended in those ten categories, I tried so to understand, O my
God, Thy wonderful and unchangeable unity as if Thou also hadst been
subjected to Thine own greatness or beauty, so that they should exist in
Thee as their subject, like as in bodies, whereas Thou Thyself art Thy
greatness and beauty? But a body is not great or fair because it is a
body, seeing that, though it were less great or fair, it should
nevertheless be a body. But that which I had conceived of Thee was
falsehood, not truth,—fictions of my misery, not the supports of Thy
blessedness. For Thou hadst commanded, and it was done in me, that the
earth should bring forth briars and thorns to me, <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) and that with labour I should get my
bread. <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md)

<span id="vi.IV.XVI-p8"></span>30. And what did it profit me that I, the
base slave of vile affections, read unaided, and understood, all the
books that I could get of the so-called liberal arts? And I took delight
in them, but knew not whence came whatever in them was true and certain.
For my back then was to the light, and my face towards the things
enlightened; whence my face, with which I discerned the things
enlightened, was not itself enlightened. Whatever was written either on
rhetoric or logic, geometry, music, or arithmetic, did I, without any
great difficulty, and without the teaching of any man, understand, as
Thou knowest, O Lord my God, because both quickness of comprehension and
acuteness of perception are Thy gifts. Yet did I not thereupon sacrifice
to Thee. So, then, it served not to my use, but rather to my
destruction, since I went about to get so good a portion of my
substance <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) into my own power; and
I kept not my strength for Thee, <span id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md)
but went away from Thee into a far country, to waste it upon
harlotries. <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) For what did good
abilities profit me, if I did not employ them to good uses? For I did
not perceive that those arts were acquired with great difficulty, even
by the studious and those gifted with genius, until I endeavoured to
explain them to such; and he was the most proficient in them who
followed my explanations not too slowly.

<span id="vi.IV.XVI-p12"></span>31. But what did this profit me,
supposing that Thou, O Lord God, the Truth, wert a bright and vast
body, <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) and I a piece of that
body? Perverseness too great! But such was I. Nor do I blush, O my God,
to confess to Thee Thy mercies towards me, and to call upon Thee—I, who
blushed not then to avow before men my blasphemies, and to bark against
Thee. What profited me then my nimble wit in those sciences and all
those knotty volumes, disentangled by me without help from a human
master, seeing that I erred so odiously, and with such sacrilegious
baseness, in the doctrine of piety? Or what impediment was it to Thy
<span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span
id="vi.IV.XVI-Page_78"></span>little ones to have a far slower wit,
seeing that they departed not far from Thee, that in the nest of Thy
Church they might safely become fledged, and nourish the wings of
charity by the food of a sound faith? O Lord our God, under the shadow
of Thy wings let us hope, <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) defend
us, and carry us. Thou wilt carry us both when little, and even to grey
hairs wilt Thou carry us; <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) for
our firmness, when it is Thou, then is it firmness; but when it is our
own, then it is infirmity. Our good lives always with Thee, from which
when we are averted we are perverted. Let us now, O Lord, return, that
we be not overturned, because with Thee our good lives without any
eclipse, which good Thou Thyself art. <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) And we need not fear lest we should
find no place unto which to return because we fell away from it; for
when we were absent, our home—Thy Eternity—fell not.

<span id="vi.IV.XVI-p4"></span> “The categories enumerated by Aristotle
are <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.IV.XVI-p4.1"></span>ὀυσία, πόσον,
ποῖον, πρόστι, ποῦ, πότε, κείσθαι, ἔχειν, ποιεῖν, πάσχειν</span>; which
are usually rendered, as adequately as perhaps they can be in our
language, substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time,
situation, possession, action, suffering. The catalogue (which certainly
is but a very crude one) has been by some writers enlarged, as it is
evident may easily be done by subdividing some of the heads; and by
others curtailed, as it is no less evident that all may ultimately be
referred to the two heads of *substance* and *attribute*, or, in the
language of some logicians, ‘*accident*’” (Whately’s *Logic*, iv. 2,
sec. 1, note). “These are called in Latin the *prædicaments*, because
they can be said or predicated in the same sense of all other terms, as
well as of all the objects denoted by them, whereas no other term can be
correctly said of them, because no other is employed to express the full
extent of their meaning” (Gillies, *Analysis of Aristotle*, c. 2).
