<span id="vi.IV.II-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IV.II-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—He Teaches Rhetoric, the Only
Thing He Loved, and Scorns the Soothsayer, Who Promised Him
Victory.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.II-p2"></span>2. In those years I taught the art of
rhetoric, and, overcome by cupidity, put to sale a loquacity by which to
overcome. Yet I preferred—Lord, Thou knowest—to have honest scholars (as
they are esteemed); and these I, without artifice, taught artifices, not
to be put in practise against the life of the guiltless, though
sometimes for the life of the guilty. And Thou, O God, from afar sawest
me stumbling in that slippery path, and amid much smoke <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270) sending out some flashes of fidelity,
which I exhibited in that my guidance of such as loved vanity and sought
after leasing, <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271) I being their
companion. In those years I had one (whom I knew not in what is called
lawful wedlock, but whom my wayward passion, void of understanding, had
discovered), yet one only, remaining faithful even to her; in whom I
found out truly by my own experience what difference there is between
the restraints of the marriage bonds, contracted for the sake of issue,
and the compact of a lustful love, where children are born against the
parents will, although, being born, they compel love.

<span id="vi.IV.II-p5"></span>3. I remember, too, that when I decided to
compete for a theatrical prize, a soothsayer demanded of me what I would
give him to win; but I, detesting and abominating such foul mysteries,
answered, “That if the garland were of imperishable gold, I would not
suffer a fly to be destroyed to secure it for me.” For he was to slay
certain living creatures in his sacrifices, and by those honours to
invite the devils to give me their support. But this ill thing I also
refused, <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span
id="vi.IV.II-Page_69"></span>not out of a pure love <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272) for Thee, O God of my heart; for I
knew not how to love Thee, knowing not how to conceive aught beyond
corporeal brightness. <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273) And doth
not a soul, sighing after such-like fictions, commit fornication against
Thee, trust in false things, <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274) and
nourish the wind? <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275) But I would
not, forsooth, have sacrifices offered to devils on my behalf, though I
myself was offering sacrifices to them by that superstition. For what
else is nourishing the wind but nourishing them, that is, by our
wanderings to become their enjoyment and derision?

<span id="vi.IV.II-p6"></span> “He alone is truly pure who waiteth on
God, and keepeth himself to Him alone ” (Aug. *De Vita Beata*, sec. 18).
“Whoso seeketh God is pure, because the soul hath in God her legitimate
husband. Whosoever seeketh of God anything besides God, doth not love
God purely. If a wife loved her husband because he is rich, she is not
pure, for she loveth not her husband but the gold of her husband” (Aug.
*Serm.* 137). “Whoso seeks from God any other reward but God, and for it
would serve God, esteems what he wishes to receive more than Him from
whom he would receive it. What, then? hath God no reward? None, save
Himself. The reward of God is God Himself. This it loveth; if it love
aught beside, it is no pure love. You depart from the immortal flame,
you will be chilled, corrupted. Do not depart; it will be thy
corruption, will be fornication in thee” (Aug. *in Ps.* lxxii. sec. 32).
“The pure fear of the Lord ([Ps.
19.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009)<span id="vi.IV.II-p6.1"></span>)
is that wherewith the Church, the more ardently she loveth her husband,
the more diligently she avoids offending Him, and therefore love, when
perfected, casteth not out this fear, but it remaineth for ever and
ever” (Aug. *in loc.*). “Under the name of pure fear is signified that
will whereby we must needs be averse from sin, and avoid sin, not
through the constant anxiety of infirmity, but through the tranquillity
of affection” (*De Civ. Dei*, xiv. sec. 65).—E. B. P.

<span id="vi.IV.II-p8"></span> “Indisputably we must take care, lest the
mind, believing that which it does not see, feign to itself something
which is not, and hope for and love that which is false. For in that
case it will not be charity out of a pure heart, and of a good
conscience, and of faith unfeigned, which is the end of the commandment”
(*De Trin.* viii. sec. 6). And again (*Confessions*, i. 1): “For who can
call on Thee, not knowing Thee? For he that knoweth Thee not may call on
Thee as other than Thou art.”
