<span id="vi.XI.XIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XI.XIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Before the Times Created by
God, Times Were Not.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XIII-p2"></span>15. But if the roving thought of any one
should wander through the images of bygone time, and wonder that Thou,
the God Almighty, and All-creating, and All-sustaining, the Architect of
heaven and earth, didst for innumerable ages refrain from so great a
work before Thou wouldst make it, let him awake and consider that he
wonders at false things. For whence could innumerable ages pass by which
Thou didst not make, since Thou art the Author and Creator of all ages?
Or what times should those be which were not made by Thee? Or how should
they pass by if they had not been? Since, therefore, Thou art the
Creator of all times, if any time was before Thou madest heaven and
earth, why is it said that Thou didst refrain from working? For that
very time Thou madest, nor could times pass by before Thou madest times.
<span id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span
id="vi.XI.XIII-Page_168"></span>But if before heaven and earth there was
no time, why is it asked, What didst Thou then? For there was no “then”
when time was not.

<span id="vi.XI.XIII-p3"></span>16. Nor dost Thou by time precede time;
else wouldest not Thou precede all times. But in the excellency of an
ever-present eternity, Thou precedest all times past, and survivest all
future times, because they are future, and when they have come they will
be past; but “Thou art the same, and Thy years shall have no end.” <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md) Thy years neither go nor come; but
ours both go and come, that all may come. All Thy years stand at once
since they do stand; nor were they when departing excluded by coming
years, because they pass not away; but all these of ours shall be when
all shall cease to be. Thy years are one day, and Thy day is not daily,
but today; because Thy today yields not with tomorrow, for neither doth
it follow yesterday. Thy today is eternity; therefore didst Thou beget
the Co-eternal, to whom Thou saidst, “This day have I begotten
Thee.” <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) Thou hast made all
time; and before all times Thou art, nor in any time was there not time.
