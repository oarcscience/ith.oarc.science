<span id="vi.X.XXVIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XXVIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—On the Misery of Human
Life.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXVIII-p2"></span>39. When I shall cleave unto Thee with
all my being, then shall I in nothing have pain and labour; and my life
shall be a real life, being wholly full of Thee. But now since he whom
Thou fillest is the one Thou liftest up, I am a burden to myself, as not
being full of Thee. Joys of sorrow contend with sorrows of joy; and on
which side the victory may be I know not. Woe is me! Lord, have pity on
me. My evil sorrows contend with my good joys; and on which side the
victory may be I know not. Woe is me! Lord, have pity on me. Woe is me!
Lo, I hide not my wounds; Thou art the Physician, I the sick; Thou
merciful, I miserable. Is not the life of man upon earth a
temptation? <span id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) Who is he that
wishes for vexations and difficulties? Thou commandest them to be
endured, not to be loved. For no man loves what he endures, though he
may love to endure. For notwithstanding he rejoices to endure, he would
rather there were naught for him to endure. <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) In adversity, I desire prosperity; in
prosperity, I fear adversity. What middle place, then, is there between
these, where human life is not a temptation? Woe unto the prosperity of
this world, once and again, from fear of misfortune and a corruption of
joy! Woe unto the adversities of this world, once and again, and for the
third time, from the desire of prosperity; and because adversity itself
is a hard thing, and makes shipwreck of endurance! Is not the life of
man upon earth a temptation, and that without intermission? <span

<span id="vi.X.XXVIII-p4"></span> “It will not be safe,” says Anthony
Farindon (vol. iv. *Christ’s Temptation*, serm. 107), “for us to
challenge and provoke a temptation, but to arm and prepare ourselves
against it; to stand upon our guard, and neither to offer battle nor yet
refuse it. *Sapiens feret ista, non eliget*: ‘It is the part of a wise
man not to seek for evil, but to *endure* it.’ And to this end it
concerneth every man to exercise <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.X.XXVIII-p4.1"></span>τὴν πνευματικὴν σύνεσιν</span>, ‘his
spiritual wisdom,’ that he may discover *Spiritus ductiones et diaboli
seductiones*, ‘the Spirit’s leadings and the devil’s seducements.’” See
also Augustin’s *Serm.* lxxvi. 4, and p. 79, note 9, above.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[153:876](1010185.htm#fr_875.md) <span
id="vi.X.XXVIII-p4.2"></span>

<span id="vi.X.XXVIII-p5"></span> We have ever to endure temptation,
either in the sense of a *testing*, as when it is said, “God did tempt
Abraham” ([Gen. 22.1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.X.XXVIII-p5.1"></span>); or with the additional idea of
*yielding* to the temptation, and so committing sin, as in the use of
the word in the Lord’s Prayer ([Matt.
6.13](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.X.XXVIII-p5.2"></span>); for, as Dyke says in his *Michael and
the Dragon* (Works, i. 203, 204): “No sooner have we bathed and washed
our souls in the waters of *Repentance*, but we must presently expect
the fiery darts of Satan’s temptations to be driving at us. What we get
and gain from Satan by *Repentance*, he seeks to regain and recover by
his *Temptations*. We must not think to pass quietly out of Egypt
without Pharaoh’s pursuit, nor to travel the wilderness of this world
without the opposition of the Amalekites.” Compare Augustin, *In* *Ev.
Joann.* Tract. xliii. 6, and *Serm.* lvii. 9. See also p. 79, note 3,
above.
