<span id="vii.1.XXIV-p2"></span>This letter, written in 394 to Alypius
by Paulinus, owes its place in the collection of Augustin’s letters to
the notice of the treatises written by Augustin against the Manichæans,
and its connection with the following letter addressed by Paulinus to
Augustin himself. It is obviously one of those which, in making a
selection of letters, may be safely omitted.
