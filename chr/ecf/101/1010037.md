<span id="vi.II_1.II-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.II_1.II-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Stricken with Exceeding Grief,
He Remembers the Dissolute Passions in Which, in His Sixteenth Year, He
Used to Indulge.</span>

<span id="vi.II_1.II-p2"></span>2. But what was it that I delighted in
save to love and to be beloved? But I held it not in moderation, mind to
mind, the bright path of friendship, but out of the dark concupiscence
of the flesh and the effervescence of youth exhalations came forth which
obscured and overcast my heart, so that I was unable to discern pure
affection from unholy desire. Both boiled confusedly within me, and
dragged away my unstable youth into the rough places of unchaste
desires, and plunged me into a gulf of infamy. Thy anger had
overshadowed me, and I knew it not. I was become deaf by the rattling of
the chains of my mortality, the punishment for my soul’s pride; and I
wandered farther from Thee, and Thou didst “suffer” <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187) me; and I was tossed to and fro, and
wasted, and poured out, and boiled over in my fornications, and Thou
didst hold Thy peace, O Thou my tardy joy! Thou then didst hold Thy
peace, and I wandered still farther from Thee, into more and more barren
seed-plots of sorrows, with proud dejection and restless lassitude.

<span id="vi.II_1.II-p4"></span>3. Oh for one to have regulated my
disorder, and turned to my profit the fleeting beauties of the things
around me, and fixed a bound to their sweetness, so that the tides of my
youth might have spent themselves upon the conjugal shore, if so be they
could not be tranquillized and satisfied within the object of a family,
as Thy law appoints, O Lord,—who thus formest the offspring of our
death, being able also with a tender hand to blunt the thorns which were
excluded from Thy paradise! For Thy omnipotency is not far from us even
when we are far from Thee, else in truth ought I more vigilantly to have
given heed to the voice from the clouds: “Nevertheless, such shall have
trouble in the flesh, but I spare you;” <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188) and, “It is good for a man not to
touch a woman;” <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189) and, “He that is
unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
please the Lord; but he that is married careth for the things that are
of the world, how he may please his wife.” <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190) I should, therefore, have listened
more attentively to these words, and, being severed “for the kingdom of
heaven’s sake,” <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191) I would with
greater happiness have expected Thy embraces.

<span id="vi.II_1.II-p9"></span>4. But I, poor fool, seethed as does the
sea, and, forsaking Thee, followed the violent course of my own stream,
and exceeded all Thy limitations; nor did I escape Thy scourges. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192) For what mortal can do so? But Thou
wert always by me, mercifully angry, and dashing with the bitterest
vexations all my illicit pleasures, in order that I might seek pleasures
free from vexation. But where I could meet with such except in Thee, O
Lord, I could not find,—except in Thee, who teachest by sorrow, <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193) and <span id="page_56">p. 56</span>
<span id="vi.II_1.II-Page_56"></span>woundest us to heal us, and killest
us that we may not die from Thee. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194) Where was I, and how far was I exiled
from the delights of Thy house, in that sixteenth year of the age of my
flesh, when the madness of lust—to the which human shamelessness
granteth full freedom, although forbidden by Thy laws—held complete sway
over me, and I resigned myself entirely to it? Those about me meanwhile
took no care to save me from ruin by marriage, their sole care being
that I should learn to make a powerful speech, and become a persuasive
orator.
