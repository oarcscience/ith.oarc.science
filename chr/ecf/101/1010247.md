id="vi.XII.XIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Of the Depth of the Sacred
Scripture, and Its Enemies.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XIV-p2"></span>17. Wonderful is the depth of Thy
oracles, whose surface is before us, inviting the little ones; and yet
wonderful is the depth, O my God, wonderful is the depth. <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) It is awe to look into it; and awe
of honour, and a tremor of love. The enemies thereof I hate
vehemently. <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) Oh, if Thou
wouldest slay them with Thy two-edged sword, <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md) that they be not its enemies! For
thus do I love, that they should be slain unto themselves that they may
live unto Thee. But behold others not reprovers, but praisers of the
book of Genesis,—“The Spirit of God,” say they, “Who by His servant
Moses wrote these things, willed not that these words should be thus
understood. He willed not that it should be understood as Thou sayest,
but as we say.” Unto whom, O God of us all, Thyself being Judge, do I
thus answer.

id="vi.XII.XIV-p5.1"></span>. He refers to the Manichæans (see p. 71,
note l). In his comment on this place, he interprets the “two-edged
sword” to mean the Old and New Testament, called two-edged, he says,
because it speaks of things temporal and eternal.
