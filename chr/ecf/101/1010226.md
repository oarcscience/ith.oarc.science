Mind.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XXV-p2"></span>32. And I confess unto Thee, O Lord, that
I am as yet ignorant as to what time is, and again I confess unto Thee,
O Lord, that I know that I speak these things in time, and that I have
already long spoken of time, and that very “long” is not long save by
the stay of time. How, then, know I this, when I know not what time is?
Or is it, perchance, that I know not in what wise I may express what I
know? Alas for me, that I do not at least know the extent of my own
ignorance! Behold, O my God, before Thee I lie not. As I speak, so is my
heart. Thou shalt light my candle; Thou, O Lord my God, wilt enlighten
my darkness. <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050)
