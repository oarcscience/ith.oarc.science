<span id="vi.II_1.V-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.II_1.V-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Concerning the Motives to Sin,
Which are Not in the Love of Evil, But in the Desire of Obtaining the
Property of Others.</span>

<span id="vi.II_1.V-p2"></span>10. There is a desirableness in all
beautiful bodies, and in gold, and silver, and all things; and in bodily
contact sympathy is powerful, and each other sense hath his proper
adaptation of body. Worldly honour hath also its glory, and the power of
command, and of overcoming; whence proceeds also the desire for revenge.
And yet to acquire all these, we must not depart from Thee, O Lord, nor
deviate from Thy law. The life which we live here hath also its peculiar
attractiveness, through a certain measure of comeliness of its own, and
harmony with all things here below. The friendships of men also are
endeared by a sweet bond, in the oneness of many souls. On account of
all these, and such as these, is sin committed; while through an
inordinate preference for these goods of a lower kind, the better and
higher are neglected,—even Thou, our Lord God, Thy truth, and Thy law.
For these meaner things have their delights, but not like unto my God,
who hath created all things; for in Him doth the righteous delight, and
He is the sweetness of the upright in heart. <span

<span id="vi.II_1.V-p4"></span>11. When, therefore, we inquire why a
crime was committed, we do not believe it, unless it appear that there
might have been the wish to obtain some of those which we designated
meaner things, or else a fear of losing them. For truly they are
beautiful and comely, although in comparison with those higher and
celestial goods they be abject and contemptible. A man hath murdered
another; what was his motive? He desired his wife or his estate; or
would steal to support himself; or he was afraid of losing something of
the kind by him; or, being injured, he was burning to be revenged. Would
he commit murder without a motive, taking delight simply in the act of
murder? Who would credit it? For as for that savage and brutal man, of
whom it is declared that he was gratuitously wicked and cruel, there is
yet <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span
id="vi.II_1.V-Page_58"></span>a motive assigned. “Lest through
idleness,” he says, “hand or heart should grow inactive.” <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203) And to what purpose? Why, even that,
having once got possession of the city through that practice of
wickedness, he might attain unto honours, empire, and wealth, and be
exempt from the fear of the laws, and his difficult circumstances from
the needs of his family, and the consciousness of his own wickedness. So
it seems that even Catiline himself loved not his own villanies, but
something else, which gave him the motive for committing them.
