<span id="vi.I_1.VI-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.I_1.VI-p2.1"></span>Chapter VI.—He Describes His Infancy, and
Lauds the Protection and Eternal Providence of God.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.VI-p3"></span>7. Still suffer me to speak before Thy
mercy—me, “dust and ashes.” <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145)
Suffer me to speak, for, behold, it is Thy mercy I address, and not
derisive man. Yet perhaps even Thou deridest me; but when Thou art
turned to me Thou wilt have compassion on me. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146) For what do I wish to say, O Lord my
God, but that I know not whence I came hither into this—shall I call it
dying life or living death? Yet, as I have heard from my parents, from
whose substance Thou didst form me,—for I myself cannot remember it,—Thy
merciful comforts sustained me. Thus it was that the comforts of a
woman’s milk entertained me; for neither my mother nor my nurses filled
their own breasts, but Thou by them didst give me the nourishment of
infancy according to Thy ordinance and that bounty of Thine which
underlieth all things. For Thou didst cause me not to want more than
Thou gavest, and those who nourished me willingly to give me what Thou
gavest them. For they, by an instinctive affection, were anxious to give
me what Thou hadst abundantly supplied. It was, in truth, good for them
that my good should come from them, though, indeed, it was not from
them, but by them; for from Thee, O God, are all good things, and from
my God is all my safety. <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147) This is
what I have since discovered, as Thou hast declared Thyself to me by the
blessings both within me and without me which Thou hast bestowed upon
me. For at that time I knew how to suck, to be satisfied when
comfortable, and to cry when in pain—nothing beyond.

<span id="vi.I_1.VI-p7"></span>8. Afterwards I began to laugh,—at first
in sleep, then when waking. For this I have heard mentioned of myself,
and I believe it (though I cannot remember it), for we see the same in
other infants. And now little by little I realized where I was, and
wished to tell my wishes to those who might satisfy them, but I could
not; for my wants were within me, while they were without, and could not
by any faculty of theirs enter into my soul. So I cast about limbs and
voice, making the few and feeble signs I could, like, though indeed not
much like, unto what I wished; and when I was not satisfied—either not
being understood, or because it would have been injurious to me—I grew
indignant that my elders were not subject unto me, and that those on
whom I had no claim did not wait on me, and avenged myself on them by
tears. That infants are such I have been able to learn by watching them;
and they, though unknowing, have better shown me that I was such an one
than my nurses who knew it.

<span id="vi.I_1.VI-p8"></span>9. And, behold, my infancy died long ago,
and I live. But Thou, O Lord, who ever livest, and in whom nothing dies
(since before the world was, and indeed before all that can be called
“before,” Thou existest, and art the God and Lord of all Thy creatures;
and with Thee fixedly abide the causes of all unstable things, the
unchanging sources of all things changeable, and the eternal reasons of
all things unreasoning and temporal), tell me, Thy suppliant, O God;
tell, O merciful One, Thy miserable servant <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148) —tell me whether my infancy succeeded
another age of mine which had at that time perished. Was it that which I
passed in my mother’s womb? For of that something has been made known to
me, and I have myself seen women with child. And what, O God, my joy,
preceded that life? Was I, indeed, anywhere, or anybody? For no one can
tell me these things, neither father nor mother, nor the experience of
others, nor my own memory. Dost Thou laugh at me for asking such things,
and command me to praise and confess Thee for what I know?

<span id="vi.I_1.VI-p10"></span>10. I give thanks to Thee, Lord of
heaven and earth, giving praise to Thee for that my first being and
infancy, of which I have no memory; for Thou hast granted to man that
from others he should come to conclusions as to himself, and that he
should believe many things concerning himself on the authority of feeble
women. Even then I had life and being; and <span id="page_48">p.
48</span> <span id="vi.I_1.VI-Page_48"></span>as my infancy closed I was
already seeking for signs by which my feelings might be made known to
others. Whence could such a creature come but from Thee, O Lord? Or
shall any man be skilful enough to fashion himself? Or is there any
other vein by which being and life runs into us save this, that “Thou, O
Lord, hast made us,” <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149) with whom
being and life are one, because Thou Thyself art being and life in the
highest? Thou art the highest, “Thou changest not,” <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150) neither in Thee doth this present day
come to an end, though it doth end in Thee, since in Thee all such
things are; for they would have no way of passing away unless Thou
sustainedst them. And since “Thy years shall have no end,” <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151) Thy years are an ever present day. And
how many of ours and our fathers’ days have passed through this Thy day,
and received from it their measure and fashion of being, and others yet
to come shall so receive and pass away! “But Thou art the same;” <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152) and all the things of to-morrow and
the days yet to come, and all of yesterday and the days that are past,
Thou wilt do to-day, Thou hast done to-day. What is it to me if any
understand not? Let him still rejoice and say, “What *is* this?” <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153) Let him rejoice even so, and rather
love to discover in failing to discover, than in discovering not to
discover Thee.

translations put against “it is manna” in the margin of the authorized
version. It is the literal significance of the Hebrew, and is so
translated in most of the old English versions. Augustin indicates
thereby the attitude of faith. Many things we are called on to believe
(to use the illustration of Locke) which are above reason, but none that
are contrary to reason. We are but as children in relation to God, and
may therefore only expect to know “parts of His ways.” Even in the
difficulties of Scripture he sees the goodness of God. “God,” he says,
“has in Scripture clothed His mysteries with clouds, that man’s love of
truth might be inflamed by the difficulty of finding them out. For if
they were only such as were readily understood, truth would not be
eagerly sought, nor would it give pleasure when found.”—*De Ver. Relig.*
c. 17.
