<span id="vii.1.CXVII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXVII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXVII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 410.)

<span id="vii.1.CXVII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXVII-p3.1"></span>From Dioscorus to Augustin.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXVII-p4"></span>To you, who esteem the substance, not
the style of expression, as important, any formal preamble to this
letter would be not only unnecessary, but irksome. Therefore, without
further preface, I beg your attention. The aged Alypius had often
promised, in answer to my request, that he would, with your help,
furnish a reply to a very few brief questions of mine in regard to the
Dialogues of Cicero; and as he is said to be at present in Mauritania, I
ask and earnestly entreat you to condescend to give, without his
assistance, those answers which, even had your brother been present, it
would doubtless have fallen to you to furnish. What I require is not
money, it is not gold; though, if you possessed these, you would, I am
sure, be willing to give them to me for any fit object. This request of
mine you can grant without effort, by merely speaking. I might importune
you at a greater length, and through many of your dear friends; but I
know your disposition, that you do not desire to be solicited, but show
kindness readily to all, if only there be nothing improper in the thing
requested: and there is absolutely nothing improper in what I ask. Be
this, however, as it may, I beg you to do me this kindness, for I am on
the point of embarking on a voyage. You know how very <span
id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span
id="vii.1.CXVII-Page_438"></span>painful it is to me to be burdensome to
any one, and much more to one of your frank disposition; but God alone
knows how irresistible is the pressure of the necessity under which I
have made this application. For, taking leave of you, and committing
myself to divine protection, I am about to undertake a voyage; and you
know the ways of men, how prone they are to censure, and you see how any
one will be regarded as illiterate and stupid who, when questions are
addressed to him, can return no answer. Therefore, I implore you, answer
all my queries without delay. Send me not away downcast. I ask this that
so I may see my parents; for on this one errand I have sent Cerdo to
you, and I now delay only till he return. My brother Zenobius has been
appointed imperial remembrancer, <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md) and has sent me a free pass for my
journey, with provisions. If I am not worthy of your reply, let at least
the fear of my forfeiting these provisions by delay move you to give
answers to my little questions. <span
id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) May the most high God spare you
long to us in health! Papas salutes your excellency most cordially.

<span id="vii.1.CXVII-p5"></span> This officer, “magister memoriæ,” was
a private secretary of the emperor, and had, among other privileges of
his office, the right of granting liberty to private individuals to
travel by the imperial conveyances along the great highways connecting
Rome with the remotest boundaries of the provinces. See Suetonitis,
*Vita Augusti*, chap. xlix., and Pliny, *Letters*, Books x.-xiv., and
*Codex Justiniani*, Book xii. Title 51.

<span id="vii.1.CXVII-p6"></span> We conjecture from the context that
this expresses the force of the obscure words, “saltem timeantur
annonæ.”
