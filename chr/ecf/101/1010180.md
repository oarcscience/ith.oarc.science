<span id="vi.X.XXIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XXIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—All Wish to Rejoice in the
Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXIII-p2"></span>33. It is not, then, certain that all
men wish to be happy, since those who wish not to rejoice in Thee, which
is the only happy life, do not verily desire the happy life. Or do all
desire this, but because “the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh,” so that they “cannot do the things that they
would,” <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) they fall upon that
which they are able to do, and with that are content; because that which
they are not able to do, they do not so will as to make them able? <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) For I ask of every man, whether he
would rather rejoice in truth or in falsehood. They will no more
hesitate to say, “in truth,” than to say, “that they wish to be happy.”
For a happy life is joy in the truth. For this is joy in Thee, who art
“the truth,” <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) O God, “my
light,” <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) “the health of my
countenance, and my God.” <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) All
wish for this happy life; this life do all wish for, which is the only
happy one; joy in the truth do all wish for. <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) I have had experience of many who
wished to deceive, but not one who wished to be deceived. Where, then,
did they know this happy life, save where they knew also the truth? For
they love it, too, since they would not be deceived. And when they love
a happy life, which is naught else but joy in the truth, assuredly they
love also the truth; which yet they would not love were there not some
knowledge of it in the memory. Wherefore, then, do they not rejoice in
it? Why are they not happy? Because they are more entirely occupied with
other things which rather make them miserable, than that which would
make them happy, which they remember so little of. For there is yet a
little light in men; let them walk—let them “walk,” that the “darkness”
seize them not. <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md)

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span id="vi.X.XXIII-Page_152"></span>

<span id="vi.X.XXIII-p10"></span>34. Why, then, doth truth beget
hatred <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) and that man of
thine, <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) preaching the truth
become an enemy unto them, whereas a happy life is loved, which is
naught else but joy in the truth; unless that truth is loved in such a
sort as that those who love aught else wish that to be the truth which
they love, and, as they are willing to be deceived, are unwilling to be
convinced that they are so? Therefore do they hate the truth for the
sake of that thing which they love instead of the truth. They love truth
when she shines on them, and hate her when she rebukes them. For,
because they are not willing to be deceived, and wish to deceive, they
love her when she reveals herself, and hate her when she reveals them.
On that account shall she so requite them, that those who were unwilling
to be discovered by her she both discovers against their will, and
discovers not herself unto them. Thus, thus, truly thus doth the human
mind, so blind and sick, so base and unseemly, desire to lie concealed,
but wishes not that anything should be concealed from it. But the
opposite is rendered unto it,—that itself is not concealed from the
truth, but the truth is concealed from it. Yet, even while thus
wretched, it prefers to rejoice in truth rather than in falsehood. Happy
then will it be, when, no trouble intervening, it shall rejoice in that
only truth by whom all things else are true.
