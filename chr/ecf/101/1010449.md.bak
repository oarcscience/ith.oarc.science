<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 418.)

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p3.1"></span>To Boniface,</span>* <span
id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866.md) *<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p4.1"></span>My Noble Lord and Justly Distinguished
and Honourable Son, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>*

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p5"></span>1. I had already written a reply to
your Charity, but while I was waiting for an opportunity of forwarding
the letter, my beloved son Faustus arrived here on his way to your
Excellency. After he had received the letter which I had intended to be
carried by him to your Benevolence, he stated to me that you were very
desirous that I should write you something which might build <span
id="page_553">p. 553</span> <span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-Page_553"></span>you
up unto the eternal salvation of which you have hope in Christ Jesus our
Lord. And, although I was busily occupied at the time, he insisted, with
an earnestness corresponding to the love which, as you know, he bears to
you, that I should do this without delay. To meet his convenience,
therefore, as he was in haste to depart, I thought it better to write,
though necessarily without much time for reflection, rather than put off
the gratification of your pious desire, my noble lord and justly
distinguished and honourable son.

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p6"></span>2. All is contained in these brief
sentences: “Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy strength: and love thy neighbour as
thyself;” <span id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867.md) for these are the
words in which the Lord, when on earth, gave an epitome of religion,
saying in the gospel, “On these two commandments hang all the law and
the prophets.” Daily advance, then, in this love, both by praying and by
well-doing, that through the help of Him, who enjoined it on you, and
whose gift it is, it may be nourished and increased, until, being
perfected, it render you perfect. “For this is the love which,” as the
apostle says, “is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is
given unto us.” <span id="fr_2868"></span>[2869](#fn_2868.md) This is “the
fulfilling of the law;” <span id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869.md) this
is the same love by which faith works, of which he says again, “Neither
circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith, which
worketh by love.” <span id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870.md)

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p11"></span>3. In this love, then, all our holy
fathers, patriarchs, prophets, and apostles pleased God. In this all
true martyrs contended against the devil even to the shedding of blood,
and because in them it neither waxed cold nor failed, they became
conquerors. In this all true believers daily make progress, seeking to
acquire not an earthly kingdom, but the kingdom of heaven; not a
temporal, but an eternal inheritance; not gold and silver, but the
incorruptible riches of the angels; not the good things of this life,
which are enjoyed with trembling, and which no one can take with him
when he dies, but the vision of God, whose grace and power of imparting
felicity transcend all beauty of form in bodies not only on earth but
also in heaven, transcend all spiritual loveliness in men, however just
and holy, transcend all the glory of the angels and powers of the world
above, transcend not only all that language can express, but all that
thought can imagine concerning Him. And let us not despair of the
fulfilment of such a great promise because it is exceeding great, but
rather believe that we shall receive it because He who has promised it
is exceeding great, as the blessed Apostle John says: “Now are we the
sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know
that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him
as He is.” <span id="fr_2871"></span>[2872](#fn_2871.md)

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p13"></span>4. Do not think that it is
impossible for any one to please God while engaged in active military
service. Among such persons was the holy David, to whom God gave so
great a testimony; among them also were many righteous men of that time;
among them was also that centurion who said to the Lord: “I am not
worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only,
and my servant shall be healed: for I am a man under authority, having
soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to
another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth
it;” and concerning whom the Lord said: “Verily, I say unto you, I have
not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” <span
id="fr_2872"></span>[2873](#fn_2872.md) Among them was that Cornelius to
whom an angel said: “Cornelius, thine alms are accepted, and thy prayers
are heard,” <span id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873.md) when he directed
him to send to the blessed Apostle Peter, and to hear from him what he
ought to do, to which apostle he sent a devout soldier, requesting him
to come to him. Among them were also the soldiers who, when they had
come to be baptized by John,—the sacred forerunner of the Lord, and the
friend of the Bridegroom, of whom the Lord says: “Among them that are
born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the
Baptist,” <span id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874.md) —and had inquired
of him what they should do, received the answer, “Do violence to no man,
neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.” <span
id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875.md) Certainly he did not prohibit them
to serve as soldiers when he commanded them to be content with their pay
for the service.

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p18"></span>5. They occupy indeed a higher place
before God who, abandoning all these secular employments, serve Him with
the strictest chastity; but “every one,” as the apostle says, “hath his
proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after
that.” <span id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876.md) Some, then, in praying
for you, fight against your invisible enemies; you, in fighting for
them, contend against the barbarians, their visible enemies. Would that
one faith existed in all, for then there would be less weary struggling,
and the devil with his angels would be more easily conquered; but since
it is necessary in this life that the citizens of the kingdom of heaven
should be subjected to temptations among erring and impious men, that
they <span id="page_554">p. 554</span> <span
id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-Page_554"></span>may be exercised, and “tried as gold
in the furnace,” <span id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877.md) we ought not
before the appointed time to desire to live with those alone who are
holy and righteous, so that, by patience, we may deserve to receive this
blessedness in its proper time.

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p21"></span>6. Think, then, of this first of
all, when you are arming for the battle, that even your bodily strength
is a gift of God; for, considering this, you will not employ the gift of
God against God. For, when faith is pledged, it is to be kept even with
the enemy against whom the war is waged, how much more with the friend
for whom the battle is fought! Peace should be the object of your
desire; war should be waged only as a necessity, and waged only that God
may by it deliver men from the necessity and preserve them in peace. For
peace is not sought in order to the kindling of war, but war is waged in
order that peace may be obtained. Therefore, even in waging war, cherish
the spirit of a peacemaker, that, by conquering those whom you attack,
you may lead them back to the advantages of peace; for our Lord says:
“Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of
God.” <span id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878.md) If, however, peace
among men be so sweet as procuring temporal safety, how much sweeter is
that peace with God which procures for men the eternal felicity of the
angels! Let necessity, therefore, and not your will, slay the enemy who
fights against you. As violence is used towards him who rebels and
resists, so mercy is due to the vanquished or the captive, especially in
the case in which future troubling of the peace is not to be feared.

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p23"></span>7. Let the manner of your life be
adorned by chastity, sobriety, and moderation; for it is exceedingly
disgraceful that lust should subdue him whom man finds invincible, and
that wine should overpower him whom the sword assails in vain. As to
worldly riches, if you do not possess them, let them not be sought after
on earth by doing evil; and if you possess them, let them by good works
be laid up in heaven. The manly and Christian spirit ought neither to be
elated by the accession, nor crushed by the loss of this world’s
treasures. Let us rather think of what the Lord says: “Where your
treasure is, there will your heart be also;” <span
id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879.md) and certainly, when we hear the
exhortation to lift up our hearts, it is our duty to give unfeignedly
the response which you know that we are accustomed to give. <span
id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880.md)

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p26"></span>8. In these things, indeed, I know
that you are very careful, and the good report which I hear of you fills
me with great delight, and moves me to congratulate you on account of it
in the Lord. This letter, therefore, may serve rather as a mirror in
which you may see what you are, than as a directory from which to learn
what you ought to be: nevertheless, whatever you may discover, either
from this letter or from the Holy Scriptures, to be still wanting to you
in regard to a holy life, persevere in urgently seeking it both by
effort and by prayer; and for the things which you have, give thanks to
God as the Fountain of goodness, whence you have received them; in every
good action let the glory be given to God, and humility be exercised by
you, for, as it is written, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is
from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.” <span
id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881.md) But however much you may advance in
the love of God and of your neighbour, and in true piety, do not
imagine, as long as you are in this life, that you are without sin, for
concerning this we read in Holy Scripture: “Is not the life of man upon
earth a life of temptation?” <span id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882.md)
Wherefore, since always, as long as you are in this body, it is
necessary for you to say in prayer, as the Lord taught us: “Forgive us
our debts, as we forgive our debtors,” <span
id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883.md) remember quickly to forgive, if any
one shall do you wrong and shall ask pardon from you, that you may be
able to pray sincerely, and may prevail in seeking pardon for your own
sins.

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p30"></span>These things, my beloved friend, I
have written to you in haste, as the anxiety of the bearer to depart
urged me not to detain him; but I thank God that I have in some measure
complied with your pious wish. May the mercy of God ever protect you, my
noble lord and justly distinguished son.

<span id="vii.1.CLXXXIX-p4"></span> Count Boniface, to whom St. Augustin
also addressed Letters CLXXXV. and CCXX., was governor of the province
of Africa under Placidia, who for twenty-five years ruled the empire in
the name of her son Valentinian. By his perfidious rival Ætius, Boniface
was persuaded to disobey the order of Placidia, when, under the
instigation of Ætius himself, she recalled him from the government of
Africa. The necessity of powerful allies in order to maintain his
position led him to invite the Vandals to pass from Spain into Africa.
They came, under Genseric, and the fertile provinces of Northern Africa
fell an easy prey to their invading armies. When the treachery of Ætius
was discovered, Placidia received Boniface again into favour, and he
devoted all his military talents to the task of expelling the barbarians
whom his own invitation had made masters of North Africa. But it was now
too late to wrest this Roman province from the Vandals; defeated in a
great battle, Boniface was compelled in 430 to retire into Hippo Regius,
where he succeeded in resisting the besieging army for fourteen months.
It was during this siege, and after it had continued three months, that
Augustin died. Reinforced by troops from Constantinople, Boniface fought
one more desperate but unsuccessful battle, after which he left Hippo in
the hands of Genseric, and returned by order of Placidia to Italy. For
fuller particulars of his history, see Gibbon’s *History of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire,* ch. xxxiii.
