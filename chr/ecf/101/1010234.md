id="vi.XII.I-p1.1"></span>Chapter I .—The Discovery of Truth is
Difficult, But God Has Promised that He Who Seeks Shall Find.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.I-p2"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.XII.I-p2.1"></span>My</span> heart, O Lord, affected by the words
of Thy Holy Scripture, is much busied in this poverty of my life; and
therefore, for the most part, is the want of human intelligence copious
in language, because inquiry speaks more than discovery, and because
demanding is longer than obtaining, and the hand that knocks is more
active than the hand that receives. We hold the promise; who shall break
it? “If God be for us, who can be against us?” <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) “Ask, and ye shall have; seek, and
ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one
that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that
knocketh it shall be opened.” <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md)
These are Thine own promises; and who need fear to be deceived where the
Truth promiseth?
