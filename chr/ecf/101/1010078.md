<span id="vi.V.II-p2"></span>2. Let the restless and the unjust depart
and flee from Thee. Thou both seest them and distinguishest the shadows.
And lo! all things with them are fair, yet are they themselves
foul. <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354) And how have they injured
Thee? <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355) Or in what have they
disgraced Thy government, which is just and perfect from heaven even to
the lowest parts of the earth. For whither fled they when they fled from
Thy presence? <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356) Or where dost Thou
not find them? But they fled that they might not see Thee seeing them,
and blinded might stumble against Thee; <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357) since Thou forsakest nothing that Thou
hast made <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358) —that the unjust might
stumble against Thee, and justly be hurt, <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359) withdrawing themselves from Thy
gentleness, and stumbling against Thine uprightness, and falling upon
their own roughness. Forsooth, they know not that Thou art everywhere
whom no place encompasseth, and that Thou alone art near even to those
that remove far from Thee. <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360) Let
them, then, be con<span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span
id="vi.V.II-Page_80"></span>verted and seek Thee; because not as they
have forsaken their Creator hast Thou forsaken Thy creature. Let them be
converted and seek Thee; and behold, Thou art there in their hearts, in
the hearts of those who confess to Thee, and cast themselves upon Thee,
and weep on Thy bosom after their obdurate ways, even Thou gently wiping
away their tears. And they weep the more, and rejoice in weeping, since
Thou, O Lord, not man, flesh and blood, but Thou, Lord, who didst make,
remakest and comfortest them. And where was I when I was seeking Thee?
And Thou wert before me, but I had gone away even from myself; nor did I
find myself, much less Thee!

<span id="vi.V.II-p3"></span> Augustin frequently recurs to the idea,
that in God’s overruling Providence, the foulness and sin of man does
not disturb the order and fairness of the universe. He illustrates the
idea by reference to music, painting, and oratory. “For as the beauty of
a picture is increased by well-managed shadows, so, to the eye that has
skill to discern it, the universe is beautified even by sinners, though,
considered by themselves, their deformity is a sad blemish” (*De Civ.
Dei*, xi. 23). So again, he says, God would never have created angels or
men whose future wickedness he foreknew, unless He could turn them to
the use of the good, “thus embellishing the course of the ages as it
were an exquisite poem set off with antitheses” (*ibid.* xi. 18); and
further on, in the same section, “as the oppositions of contraries lend
beauty to language, so the beauty of the course of this world is
achieved by the opposition of contraries, arranged, as it were, by an
eloquence not of words, but of things.” These reflections affected
Augustin’s views as to the last things. They seemed to him to render the
idea entertained by Origen (*De Princ.* i. 6) and other Fathers as to a
general restoration \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.V.II-p3.1"></span>ἀποκατάστασις</span>\] unnecessary. See
Hagenbach’s *Hist. of Doct.* etc. i. 383 (Clark).

<span id="vi.V.II-p4"></span> “In Scripture they are called God’s
enemies who oppose His rule not by nature but by vice, having no power
to hurt Him, but only themselves. For they are His enemies not through
their power to hurt, but by their will to oppose Him. For God is
unchangeable, and wholly proof against injury” (*De Civ. Dei*, xii. 3).

<span id="vi.V.II-p8"></span> He also refers to the injury man does
himself by sin in ii. sec. 13, above; and elsewhere he suggests the law
which underlies it: “The vice which makes those who are called God’s
enemies resist Him, is an evil not to God but to themselves. And to them
it is an evil solely because it corrupts the good of their nature.” And
when we suffer for our sins we should thank God that we are not
unpunished (*De Civ. Dei*, xii. 3). But if, when God punishes us, we
still continue in our sin, we shall be more confirmed in habits of sin,
and then, as Augustin in another place (*in Ps.* vii. 15) warns us, “our
facility in sinning will be the punishment of God for our former
yieldings to sin.” See also Butler’s *Analogy*, Pt. i. ch. 5, “On a
state of probation as intended for moral discipline and improvement.”
