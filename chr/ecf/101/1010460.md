<span id="vii.1.CCXII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXII-p3.1"></span>To Quintilianus, My Lord Most Blessed and
Brother and Fellow Bishop Deservedly Venerable, Augustin Sends
Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXII-p4"></span>Venerable father, I commend to you in
the love of Christ these honourable servants of God and precious members
of Christ, Galla, a widow (who has taken on herself sacred vows), and
her daughter Simplicia, a consecrated virgin, who is subject to her
mother by reason of her age, but above her by reason of her holiness. We
have nourished them as far as we have been able with the word of God;
and by this epistle, as if it were with my own hand, I commit them to
you, to be comforted and aided in every way which their interest or
necessity requires. This duty your Holiness would doubtless have
undertaken without any recommendation from me; for if it is our duty on
account of the Jerusalem above, of which we are all citizens, and in
which they desire to have a place of distinguished holiness, to cherish
towards them not only the affection due to fellow-citizens, but even
brotherly love, how much stronger is their claim on you, who reside in
the same country in this earth in which these ladies, for the love of
Christ, renounced the distinctions of this world! I also ask you to
condescend to receive with the same love with which I have offered it my
official salutation, and to remember me in your prayers. These ladies
carry with them relics of the most blessed and glorious martyr Stephen:
your Holiness knows how to give due honour to these, as we have
done. <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md)
