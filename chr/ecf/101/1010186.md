God.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXIX-p2"></span>40. And my whole hope is only in Thy
exceeding great mercy. Give what Thou commandest, and command what Thou
wilt. Thou imposest continency upon us, <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) “nevertheless, when I perceived,”
saith one, “that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her
me; . . . that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she
was.” <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) For by continency are we
bound up and brought into one, whence we were scattered abroad into
many. For he loves Thee too little who loves aught with Thee, which he
loves not for Thee, <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) O love, who
ever burnest, and art never quenched! O charity, my God, kindle me! Thou
commandest continency; give what Thou commandest, and command what Thou
wilt.

<span id="vi.X.XXIX-p3"></span> In his 38th *Sermon*, he distinguishes
between *continentia* and *sustinentia*; the first guarding us from the
allurements of worldliness and sin, while the second enables us to
endure the troubles of life.

<span id="vi.X.XXIX-p5"></span> In his *De Trin.* ix. 13 (“*In what
desire and love differ*”), he says, that when the creature is loved for
itself, and the love of it is not referred to its Creator, it is desire
(*cupiditas*) and not true love. See also p. 129, note 8, above.
