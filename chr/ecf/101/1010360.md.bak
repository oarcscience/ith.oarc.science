<span id="vii.1.LIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 400.)

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LIII-p3.1"></span>To Generosus, Our Most Loved and Honourable
Brother, Fortunatus, Alypius, and Augustin Send Greeting in the
Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LIII-p4.1"></span>Chap. I.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p5"></span>1. Since you were pleased to acquaint us
with the letter sent to you by a Donatist presbyter, although, with the
spirit of a true Catholic, you regarded it with contempt, nevertheless,
to aid you in seeking his welfare if his folly be not incurable, we beg
you to forward to him the following reply. He wrote that an angel had
enjoined him to declare to you the episcopal succession <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) of the Christianity of your town;
to you, forsooth, who hold the Christianity not of your own town only,
nor of Africa only, but of the whole world, the Christianity which has
been published, and is now published to all nations. This proves that
they think it a small matter that they themselves are not ashamed of
being cut off, and are taking no measures, while they may, to be
engrafted anew; they are not content unless they do their utmost to cut
others off, and bring them to share their own fate, as withered branches
fit for the flames. Wherefore, even if you had yourself been visited by
that angel whom he affirms to have appeared to him,—a statement which we
regard as a cunning fiction; and if the angel had said to you the very
words which he, on the warrant of the alleged command, repeated to
you,—even in that case it would have been your duty to remember the
words of the apostle: “Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any
other gospel unto you than that we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed.” <span id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md) For to you it was
proclaimed by the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, that His
“gospel shall be preached unto all nations, and then shall the end
come.” <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md) To you it has moreover
been proclaimed by the writings of the prophets and of the apostles,
that the promises were given to Abraham and to his seed, which is
Christ, <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) when God said unto
him: “In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed.” Having
then such promises, if an angel from heaven were to say to thee, “Let go
the Christianity of the whole earth, and cling to the faction of
Donatus, the episcopal succession of which is set forth in a letter of
their bishop in your town,” he ought to be accursed in your estimation;
because he would be endeavouring to cut you off from the whole Church,
and thrust you into a small party, and make you forfeit your interest in
the promises of God.

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p10"></span>2. For if the lineal succession of
bishops is to be taken into account, with how much more certainty and
benefit to the Church do we reckon back till we reach Peter himself, to
whom, as bearing in a figure the whole Church, <span
id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) the Lord said: “Upon this rock will
I build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it!” <span id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md) The successor of Peter
was Linus, and his successors in unbroken continuity were
these:—Clement, Anacletus, Evaristus, Alexander, Sixtus, Telesphorus,
Iginus, Anicetus, Pius, Soter, Eleutherius, Victor, Zephirinus,
Calixtus, Urbanus, Pontianus, Antherus, Fabianus, Cornelius, Lucius,
Stephanus, Xystus, Dionysius, Felix, Eutychianus, Gaius, Marcellinus,
Marcellus, Eusebius, Miltiades, Sylvester, Marcus, Julius, Liberius,
Damasus, and Siricius, whose successor is the present Bishop Anastasius.
In this order of succession no Donatist bishop is found. But, reversing
the natural course of things, the Donatists sent to Rome from Africa an
ordained bishop, who, putting himself at the head of a few Africans in
the great metropolis, gave some notoriety to the name of “mountain men,”
or Cutzupits, by which they were known.

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p13"></span>3. Now, even although some traditor had
in the course of these centuries, through inadvertence, obtained a place
in that order of bishops, reaching from Peter himself to Anastasius, who
now occupies that see,—this fact would do no harm to the Church and to
Christians having no share in the guilt of another; for the Lord,
providing against such a case, says, concerning officers in the Church
who are wicked: “All whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and
do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.” <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711.md) Thus the stability of the hope of
the faithful is secured, inasmuch as being fixed, not in man, but in the
Lord, it never can be swept away by the raging of impious schism;
whereas they themselves are swept away who read in the Holy Scriptures
the names of churches to which the apostles wrote, and in which they
have no bishop. For what could more clearly prove their perversity and
their folly, than their saying to their clergy, when they read these
letters, “Peace be with thee,” <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712.md) at the very time that they are
themselves disjoined from the peace of those churches to which the
letters were originally written?

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span id="vii.1.LIII-Page_299"></span>

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p16"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LIII-p16.1"></span>Chap. II.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p17"></span>4. Lest, however, he should
congratulate himself too much on the succession of bishops in
Constantina, your own city, read to him the records of proceedings
before Munatius Felix, the resident Flamen \[heathen priest\], who was
governor of your city in the consulship of Diocletian for the eighth
time, and Maximian for the seventh, on the eleventh day before the
calends of June. By these records it is proved that the bishop Paulus
was a traditor; the fact being that Sylvanus was then one of his
sub-deacons, and, along with him, produced and surrendered certain
things belonging to the Lord’s house, which had been most carefully
concealed, namely a box <span id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713.md) and a
lamp of silver, upon seeing which a certain Victor is reported to have
said, “You would have been put to death if you had not found these.”
Your Donatist priest makes great account of this Sylvanus, this clearly
convicted traditor, in the letter which he writes you, mentioning him as
then ordained to the office of bishop by the Primate Secundus of
Tigisis. Let them keep their proud tongues silent, let them admit the
charges which may truly be brought against themselves, and not utter
foolish calumnies against others. Read to him also, if he permits it,
the ecclesiastical records of the proceedings of this same Secundus of
Tigisis in the house of Urbanus Donatus, in which he remitted to God, as
judge, men who confessed themselves to have been traditors—Donatus of
Masculi, Marinns of Aquæ Tibilitanæ, Donatus of Calama, with whom as his
colleagues, though they were confessed traditors, he ordained their
bishop Sylvanus, of whose guilt in the same matter I have given the
history above. Read to him also the proceedings before Zenophilus, a man
of consular rank, in the course of which a certain deacon of theirs,
Nundinarius, being angry with Sylvanus for having excommunicated him,
brought all these facts into court, proving them incontestably by
authentic documents, and the questioning of witnesses, and the reading
of public records and many letters.

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p19"></span>5. There are many other things which
you might read in his hearing, if he is disposed not to dispute angrily,
but to listen prudently, such as: the petition of the Donatists to
Constantine, begging him to send from Gaul bishops who should settle
this controversy which divided the African bishops; the Acts recording
what took place in Rome, when the case was taken up and decided by the
bishops whom he sent thither: also you might read in other letters how
the Emperor aforesaid states that they had made a complaint to him
against the decision of their peers—the bishops, namely, whom he had
sent to Rome; how he appointed other bishops to try the case over again
at Arles; how they appealed from that tribunal also to the Emperor
again; how at last he himself investigated the matter; and how he most
emphatically declares that they were vanquished by the innocence of
Cæcilianus. Let him listen to these things if he be willing, and he will
be silent and desist from plotting against the truth.

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p20"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LIII-p20.1"></span>Chap. III.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p21"></span>6. We rely, however, not so much on
these documents as on the Holy Scriptures, wherein a dominion extending
to the ends of the earth among all nations is promised as the heritage
of Christ, separated from which by their sinful schism they reproach us
with the crimes which belong to the chaff in the Lord’s threshing-floor,
which must be permitted to remain mixed with the good grain until the
end come, until the whole be winnowed in the final judgment. From which
it is manifest that, whether these charges be true or false, they do not
belong to the Lord’s wheat, <span id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714.md)
which must grow until the end of the world throughout the whole field,
*i.e.* the whole earth; as we know, not by the testimony of a false
angel such as confirmed your correspondent in his error, but from the
words of the Lord in the Gospel. And because these unhappy Donatists
have brought the reproach of many false and empty accusations against
Christians who were blameless, but who are throughout the world mingled
with the chaff or tares, *i.e.* with Christians unworthy of the name,
therefore God has, in righteous retribution, appointed that they should,
by their universal Council, condemn as schismatics the Maximianists,
because they had condemned Primianus, and baptized while not in
communion with Primianus, and rebaptized those whom he had baptized, and
then after a short interval should, under the coercion of Optatus the
minion of Gildo, reinstate in the honours of their office two of these,
the bishops Felicianus of Musti and Prætextatus of Assuri, and
acknowledge the baptism of all whom they, while under sentence and
excommunicated, had baptized. If, therefore, they are not defiled by
communion with the men thus restored again to their office,—men whom
with their own mouth they had condemned as wicked and impious, and whom
they compared to those first heretics whom the earth swallowed up
alive, <span id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) —let them at last
awake and consider how great is their blindness and folly in pronouncing
the whole world defiled by unknown crimes of Africans, and the heritage
of Christ (which according to the promise has been shown unto all
nations) destroyed through the sins of these Africans by the maintenance
of communion with them; while they refuse to acknowledge themselves to
be destroyed and defiled <span id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span
id="vii.1.LIII-Page_300"></span>by communicating with men whose crimes
they had both known and condemned.

<span id="vii.1.LIII-p24"></span>7. Wherefore, since the Apostle Paul
says in another place, that even Satan transforms himself into an angel
of light, and that therefore it is not strange that his servants should
assume the guise of ministers of righteousness: <span
id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) if your correspondent did indeed
see an angel teaching him error, and desiring to separate Christians
from the Catholic unity, he has met with an angel of Satan transforming
himself into an angel of light. If, however, he has lied to you, and has
seen no such vision, he is himself a servant of Satan, assuming the
guise of a minister of righteousness. And yet, if he be not incorrigibly
obstinate and perverse, he may, by considering all the things now
stated, be delivered both from misleading others, and from being himself
misled. For, embracing the opportunity which you have given, we have met
him without any rancour, remembering in regard to him the words of the
apostle: “The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
all men, apt to teach, patient; in meekness instructing those that
oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the
acknowledging of the truth; and that they may recover themselves out of
the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.” <span
id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) If, therefore, we have said
anything severe, let him know that it arises not from the bitterness of
controversy, but from love vehemently desiring his return to the right
path. May you live safe in Christ, most beloved and honourable brother!
