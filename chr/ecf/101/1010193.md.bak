<span id="vi.X.XXXVI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XXXVI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—A Third Kind is “Pride” Which
is Pleasing to Man, Not to God.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXXVI-p2"></span>58. Shall we, then, account this too
amongst such things as are to be lightly esteemed, or shall anything
restore us to hope, save Thy complete mercy, since Thou hast begun to
change us? And Thou knowest to what extent Thou hast already changed me,
Thou who <span id="page_159">p. 159</span> <span
id="vi.X.XXXVI-Page_159"></span>first healest me of the lust of
vindicating myself, that so Thou mightest forgive all my remaining
“iniquities,” and heal all my “diseases,” and redeem my life from
corruption, and crown me with “loving-kindness and tender mercies,” and
satisfy my desire with “good things;” <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md) who didst restrain my pride with Thy
fear, and subdue my neck to Thy “yoke.” And now I bear it, and it is
“light” <span id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md) unto me, because so hast
Thou promised, and made it, and so in truth it was, though I knew it
not, when I feared to take it up. But, O Lord,—Thou who alone reignest
without pride, because Thou art the only true Lord, who hast no
lord,—hath this third kind of temptation left me, or can it leave me
during this life?

<span id="vi.X.XXXVI-p5"></span>59. The desire to be feared and loved of
men, with no other view than that I may experience a joy therein which
is no joy, is a miserable life, and unseemly ostentation. Hence
especially it arises that we do not love Thee, nor devoutly fear Thee.
And therefore dost Thou resist the proud, but givest grace unto the
humble; <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) and Thou thunderest upon
the ambitious designs of the world, and “the foundations of the hills”
tremble. <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md) Because now certain
offices of human society render it necessary to be loved and feared of
men, the adversary of our true blessedness presseth hard upon us,
everywhere scattering his snares of “well done, well done;” that while
acquiring them eagerly, we may be caught unawares, and disunite our joy
from Thy truth, and fix it on the deceits of men; and take pleasure in
being loved and feared, not for Thy sake, but in Thy stead, by which
means, being made like unto him, he may have them as his, not in harmony
of love, but in the fellowship of punishment; who aspired to exalt his
throne in the north, <span id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) that dark
and cold they might serve him, imitating Thee in perverse and distorted
ways. But we, O Lord, lo, we are Thy “little flock;” <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) do Thou possess us, stretch Thy wings
over us, and let us take refuge under them. Be Thou our glory; let us be
loved for Thy sake, and Thy word feared in us. They who desire to be
commended of men when Thou blamest, will not be defended of men when
Thou judgest; nor will they be delivered when Thou condemnest. But when
not the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul, nor he blessed who
doeth unjustly, <span id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md) but a man is
praised for some gift that Thou hast bestowed upon him, and he is more
gratified at the praise for himself, than that he possesses the gift for
which he is praised, such a one is praised while Thou blamest. And
better truly is he who praised than the one who was praised. For the
gift of God in man was pleasing to the one, while the other was better
pleased with the gift of man than that of God.
