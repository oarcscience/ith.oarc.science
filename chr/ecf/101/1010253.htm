From all these truths, of which they doubt not whose inner eye Thou hast granted to see such things, and who immoveably believe Moses, Thy servant, to have spoken in the spirit of truth; from all these, then, he taketh one who saith, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,&#8221;&#8212;that is, &#8220;In His Word, co-eternal with Himself, God made the intelligible and the sensible, or the spiritual and corporeal creature.&#8221; He taketh another, who saith, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,&#8221;&#8212;that is, &#8220;In His Word, co-eternal with Himself, God made the universal mass of this corporeal world, with all those manifest and known natures which it containeth.&#8221; He, another, who saith, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,&#8221; that is, &#8220;In His Word, co-eternal with Himself, God made the formless matter of the spiritual&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1138"></A><A HREF="#fn_1138"><FONT SIZE="1">1139</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.XII.XX-p3"></A> Augustin, in his letter to Jerome (<i>Ep.</i> clxvi. 4) on &#8220;The origin of the human soul,&#8221; says: &#8220;The soul, whether it be termed material or immaterial, has a certain nature of its own, created from a substance superior to the elements of this world.&#8221; And in his <i>De Gen. ad Lit.</i> vii. 10, he speaks of the soul being formed from a certain &#8220;spiritual matter,&#8221; even as flesh was formed from the earth. It should be observed that at one time Augustin held to the theory that the souls of infants were created by God out of nothing at each fresh birth, and only rejected this view for that of its being generated by the parents with the body under the pressure of the Pelagian controversy. The first doctrine was generally held by the Schoolmen; and William of Conches maintained this belief on the authority of Augustin,&#8212;apparently being unaware of any modification in his opinion: &#8220;Cum Augustino,&#8221; he says (Victor Cousin, <i>Ouvrages ined. d&#146;Abelard</i>, p. 673), &#8220;credo et sentio quotidie novas animas <i>nom ex traduce</i> non ex aliqua substantia, sed <i>ex nihilo, solo jussu creatoris</i> creari.&#8221; Those who held the first-named belief were called <i>Creatiani</i>; those who held the second, <i>Truduciani</i>. It may be noted as to the word &#8220;Traduciani,&#8221; that Tertullian, in his <i>De Anima</i>, chaps. 24&#8211;27, etc., frequently uses the word <i>tradux</i> in this connection. Augustin, in his <i>Retractations</i>, ii. 45, refers to his letter to Jerome, and urges that if so obscure a matter is to be discussed at all, that solution only should be received: &#8220;Qu&aelig; contraria non sit apertissimis rebus quas de originati peccato fides catholica novit in parvulis, nisi regenerentur in Christo, sine dubitatione damnandis.&#8221; On Tertullian&#146;s views, see Bishop Kays, p. 178, etc.</p>
