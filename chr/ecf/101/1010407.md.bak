<span id="vii.1.CI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CI-p1.1"></span>Letter CI.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CI-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 409.)

<span id="vii.1.CI-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CI-p3.1"></span>To Memor,</span>* <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) *<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CI-p4.1"></span>My Lord Most Blessed, and with All Veneration
Most Beloved, My Brother and Colleague Sincerely Longed For, Augustin
Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>*

<span id="vii.1.CI-p5"></span>1. I ought not to write any letter to your
holy Charity, without sending at the same time those books which by the
irresistible plea of holy love you have demanded from me, that at least
by this act of obedience I might reply to those letters by which you
have put on me a high honour indeed, but also a heavy load. Albeit,
while I bend because of the load, I am raised up because of your love.
For it is not by an ordinary man that I am loved and raised up and made
to stand erect, but by a man who is a priest of the Lord, and whom I
know to be so accepted before Him, that when you raise to the Lord your
good heart, having me in your heart, you raise me with yourself to Him.
I ought, therefore, to have sent at this time those books which I had
promised to revise. The reason why I have not sent them is that I have
not revised them, and this not because I was unwilling, but because I
was unable, having been occupied with many very urgent cares. But it
would have shown inexcusable ingratitude and hardness of heart to have
permitted the bearer, my holy colleague and brother Possidius, in whom
you will find one who is very much the same as myself, either to miss
becoming acquainted with you, who love me so much, or to come to know
you without any letter from me. For he is one who has been by my labours
nourished, not in those studies which men who are the slaves of every
kind of passion call liberal, but with the Lord’s bread, in so far as
this could be supplied to him from my scanty store.

<span id="vii.1.CI-p6"></span>2. For to men who, though they are unjust
and impious, imagine that they are well educated <span id="page_413">p.
413</span> <span id="vii.1.CI-Page_413"></span>in the liberal arts, what
else ought we to say than what we read in those writings which truly
merit the name of liberal,—“if the Son shall make you free, ye shall be
free indeed.” <span id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) For it is
through Him that men come to know, even in those studies which are
termed liberal by those who have not been called to this true liberty,
anything in them which deserves the name. For they have nothing which is
consonant with liberty, except that which in them is consonant with
truth; for which reason the Son Himself hath said: “The truth shall make
you free.” <span id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) The freedom which
is our privilege has therefore nothing in common with the innumerable
and impious fables with which the verses of silly poets are full, nor
with the fulsome and highly-polished falsehoods of their orators, nor,
in fine, with the rambling subtleties of philosophers themselves, who
either did not know anything of God, or when they knew God, did not
glorify Him as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their
imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; so that, professing
themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the
incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
birds and four-footed beasts, and to creeping things, or who, though not
wholly or at all devoted to the worship of images, nevertheless
worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator. <span
id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) Far be it, therefore, from us to
admit that the epithet liberal is justly bestowed on the lying vanities
and hallucinations, or empty trifles and conceited errors of those
men—unhappy men, who knew not the grace of God in Christ Jesus our Lord,
by which alone we are “delivered from the body of this death,” <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) and who did not even perceive the
measure of truth which was in the things which they knew. Their
historical works, the writers of which profess to be chiefly concerned
to be accurate in narrating events, may perhaps, I grant, contain some
things worthy of being known by “free” men, since the narration is true,
whether the subject described in it be the good or the evil in human
experience. At the same time, I can by no means see how men who were not
aided in their knowledge by the Holy Spirit, and who were obliged to
gather floating rumours under the limitations of human infirmity, could
avoid being misled in regard to very many things; nevertheless, if they
have no intention of deceiving, and do not mislead other men otherwise
than so far as they have themselves, through human infirmity, fallen
into a mistake, there is in such writings an approach to liberty.

<span id="vii.1.CI-p11"></span>3. Forasmuch, however, as the powers
belonging to numbers <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) in all
kinds of movements are most easily studied as they are presented in
sounds, and this study furnishes a way of rising to the higher secrets
of truth, by paths gradually ascending, so to speak, in which Wisdom
pleasantly reveals herself, and in every step of providence meets those
who love her, <span id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) desired, when I
began to have leisure for study, and my mind was not engaged by greater
and more important cares, to exercise myself by writing those books
which you have requested me to send. I then wrote six books on rhythm
alone, and proposed, I may add, to write other six on music, <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) as I at that time expected to have
leisure. But from the time that the burden of ecclesiastical cares was
laid upon me, all these recreations have passed from my hand so
completely, that now, when I cannot but respect your wish and
command,—for it is more than a request,—I have difficulty in even
finding what I had written. If, however, I had it in my power to send
you that treatise, it would occasion regret, not to me that I had obeyed
your command, but to you that you had so urgently insisted upon its
being sent. For five books of it are all but unintelligible, unless one
be at hand who can in reading not only distinguish the part belonging to
each of those between whom the discussion is maintained, but also mark
by enunciation the time which the syllables should occupy, so that their
distinctive measures may be expressed and strike the ear, especially
because in some places there occur pauses of measured length, which of
course must escape notice, unless the reader inform the hearer of them
by intervals of silence where they occur.

<span id="vii.1.CI-p15"></span>The sixth book, however, which I have
found already revised, and in which the product of the other five is
contained, I have not delayed to send to your Charity; it may, perhaps,
be not wholly unsuited to one of your venerable age. <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) As to the other five books, they
seem to me scarcely worthy of being known and read by Julian, <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) our son, and now our colleague,
for, as a deacon, he is engaged in the same warfare with ourselves. Of
him I dare not say, for it would not be true, that I love him more than
I love you; yet this I may say, that I long for him more than for you.
It may seem strange, that when I love both equally, I long more ardently
for the one than the other; but the cause of the difference is, that I
have greater hope of seeing him; for I think that if ordered or sent by
you he come to us, he will both be doing what is <span id="page_414">p.
414</span> <span id="vii.1.CI-Page_414"></span>suitable to one of his
years, especially as he is not yet hindered by weightier
responsibilities, and he will more speedily bring yourself to me.

<span id="vii.1.CI-p18"></span>I have not stated in this treatise the
kinds of metre in which the lines of David’s Psalms are composed,
because I do not know them. For it was not possible for any one, in
translating these from the Hebrew (of which language I know nothing), to
preserve the metre at the same time, lest by the exigencies of the
measure he should be compelled to depart from accurate translation
further than was consistent with the meaning of the sentences.
Nevertheless, I believe, on the testimony of those who are acquainted
with that language, that they are composed in certain varieties of
metre; for that holy man loved sacred music, and has more than any other
kindled in me a passion for its study.

<span id="vii.1.CI-p19"></span>May the shadow of the wings of the Most
High be for ever the dwelling-place <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332.md) of you all, who with oneness of
heart occupy one home, <span id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) father
and mother, bound in the same brotherhood with your sons, being all the
children of the one Father. Remember us.
