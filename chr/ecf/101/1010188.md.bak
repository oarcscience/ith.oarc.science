<span id="vi.X.XXXI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XXXI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—About to Speak of the
Temptations of the Lust of the Flesh, He First Complains of the Lust of
Eating and Drinking.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXXI-p2"></span>43. There is another evil of the day that
I would were “sufficient” unto it. <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md) For by eating and drinking we repair
the daily decays of the body, until Thou destroyest both food and
stomach, when Thou shall destroy my want with an amazing satiety, and
shalt clothe this corruptible with an eternal incorruption. <span
id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887.md) But now is necessity sweet unto me,
and against this sweetness do I fight, lest I be enthralled; and I carry
on a daily war by fasting, <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888.md)
oftentimes “bringing my body into subjection,” <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889.md) and my pains are expelled by pleasure.
For hunger and thirst are in some sort pains; they consume and destroy
like unto a fever, unless the medicine of nourishment relieve us. The
which, since it is at hand through the comfort we receive of Thy gifts,
with which land and water and air serve our infirmity, our calamity is
called pleasure.

<span id="vi.X.XXXI-p7"></span>44. This much hast Thou taught me, that I
should bring myself to take food as medicine. But during the time that I
am passing from the uneasiness of want to the calmness of satiety, even
in the very passage doth that snare of concupiscence lie in wait for me.
For the passage itself is pleasure, nor is there any other way of
passing thither, whither necessity compels us to pass. And whereas
health is the reason of eating and drinking, there joineth itself as an
hand-maid a perilous delight, which mostly tries to precede it, in order
that I may do for her sake what I say I do, or desire to do, for
health’s sake. Nor have both the same limit; for what is sufficient for
health is too little for pleasure. And oftentimes it is doubtful whether
it be the necessary care of the body which still asks nourishment, or
whether a sensual snare of desire offers its ministry. In this
uncertainty does my unhappy soul rejoice, and therein prepares an excuse
as a defence, glad that it doth not appear what may be Sufficient for
the moderation of health, that so under the pretence of health it may
conceal the business of pleasure. These temptations do I daily endeavour
to resist, and I summon Thy right hand to my help, and refer my
excitements to Thee, because as yet I have no resolve in this matter.

<span id="vi.X.XXXI-p8"></span>45. I hear the voice of my God
commanding, let not “your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and
drunkenness.” <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md) “Drunkenness,” it
is far from me; Thou wilt have mercy, that it approach not near unto me.
But “surfeiting” sometimes creepeth upon Thy servant; Thou wilt have
mercy, that it may be far from me. For no man can be continent unless
Thou give it. <span id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md) Many things which
we pray for dost <span id="page_155">p. 155</span> <span
id="vi.X.XXXI-Page_155"></span>Thou give us; and what good soever we
receive before we prayed for it, do we receive from Thee, and that we
might afterwards know this did we receive it from Thee. Drunkard was I
never, but I have known drunkards to be made sober men by Thee. Thy
doing, then, was it, that they who never were such might not be so, as
from Thee it was that they who have been so heretofore might not remain
so always; and from Thee, too was it, that both might know from whom it
was. I heard another voice of Thine, “Go not after thy lusts, but
refrain thyself from thine appetites.” <span
id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892.md) And by Thy favour have I heard this
saying likewise, which I have much delighted in, “Neither if we eat, are
we the better; neither if we eat not, are we the worse;” <span
id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md) which is to say, that neither shall
the one make me to abound, nor the other to be wretched. I heard also
another voice, “For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith
to be content, I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound .
. . I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) Lo! a soldier of the celestial
camp—not dust as we are. But remember, O Lord, “that we are dust,” <span
id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md) and that of dust Thou hast created
man; <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) and he “was lost, and is
found.” <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md) Nor could he do this of
his own power, seeing that he whom I so loved, saying these things
through the afflatus of Thy inspiration, was of that same dust. “I can,”
saith he, “do all things through Him which strengtheneth me.” <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md) Strengthen me, that I may be able.
Give what Thou commandest, and command what Thou wilt. <span
id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) He confesses to have received, and
when he glorieth, he glorieth in the Lord. <span
id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) Another have I heard entreating that
he might receive,—“Take from me,” saith he, “the greediness of the
belly;” <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) by which it appeareth, O
my holy God, that Thou givest when what Thou commandest to be done is
done.

<span id="vi.X.XXXI-p21"></span>46. Thou hast taught me, good Father,
that “unto the pure all things are pure;” <span
id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md) but “it is evil for that man who
eateth with offence;” <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md) “and that
every creature of Thine is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be
received with, thanksgiving;” <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md)
and that “meat commendeth us not to God;” <span
id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md) and that no man should “judge us in
meat or in drink;” <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906.md) and that he
that eateth, let him not despise him that eateth not; and let not him
that eateth not judge him that eateth. <span
id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907.md) These things have I learned, thanks
and praise be unto Thee, O my God and Master, who dost knock at my ears
and enlighten my heart; deliver me out of all temptation. It is not the
uncleanness of meat that I fear, but the uncleanness of lusting. I know
that permission was granted unto Noah to eat every kind of flesh <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908.md) that was good for food; <span
id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909.md) that Elias was fed with flesh; <span
id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) that John, endued with a wonderful
abstinence, was not polluted by the living creatures (that is, the
locusts <span id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911) .md) which he fed on. I
know, too, that Esau was deceived by a longing for lentiles, <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) and that David took blame to himself
for desiring water, <span id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) and that our
King was tempted not by flesh but bread. <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md) And the people in the wilderness,
therefore, also deserved reproof, not because they desired flesh, but
because, in their desire for food, they murmured against the Lord. <span
id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md)

<span id="vi.X.XXXI-p36"></span>47. Placed, then, in the midst of these
temptations, I strive daily against longing for food and drink. For it
is not of such a nature as that I am able to resolve to cut it off once
for all, and not touch it afterwards, as I was able to do with
concubinage. The bridle of the throat, therefore, is to be held in the
mean of slackness and tightness. <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md)
And who, O Lord, is he who is not in some degree carried away beyond the
bounds of necessity? Whoever he is, he is great; let him magnify Thy
name. But I am not such a one, “for I am a sinful man.” <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) Yet do I also magnify Thy name; and He
who hath “overcome the world” <span id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md)
maketh intercession to Thee for my sins, <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) accounting me among the “feeble
members” of His body, <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md) because
Thine eyes saw that of him which was imperfect; and in Thy book all
shall be written. <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md)

Council of Orleans, <span class="c9"><span

left pretty much to the individual conscience. We find Tertullian in his
*De* *Jejunio* lamenting the slight observance it received during his
day. We learn, however, from the passage in Justin Martyr, quoted in
note 4, on p. 118, above, that in his time it was enjoined as a
preparation for Baptism.

from marriage and from eating flesh. For other information on this
subject, see notes, pp. 66 and 83.

accepting the principle of asceticism. As Augustin, in his *De Mor.*
*Ecc. Cath.* sec. 39, says of all transient things, we “should use them
as far as is required for the purposes and duties of life, with the
moderation of an employer instead of the ardour of a lover.”
