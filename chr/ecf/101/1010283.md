id="vi.XIII.XVII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Allegorical Explanation of
the Sea and the Fruit-Bearing Earth—Verses 9 and 11.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XVII-p2"></span>20. Who hath gathered the embittered
together into one society? For they have all the same end, that of
temporal and earthly happiness, on account of which they do all things,
although they may fluctuate with an innumerable variety of cares. Who, O
Lord, unless Thou, saidst, Let the waters be gathered together into one
place, and let the dry land appear, <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) which “thirsteth after Thee”? <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) For the sea also is Thine, and Thou
hast made it, and Thy hands prepared the dry land. <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md) For neither is the bitterness of
men’s wills, but the gathering together of waters called sea; for Thou
even curbest the wicked desires of men’s souls, and fixest their bounds,
how far they may be permitted to advance, <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) and that their waves may be broken
against each other; and thus dost Thou make it a sea, by the order of
Thy dominion over all things.

<span id="vi.XIII.XVII-p7"></span>21. But as for the souls that thirst
after Thee, and that appear before Thee (being by other bounds divided
from the society of the sea), them Thou waterest by a secret and sweet
spring, that the earth may bring forth her fruit, <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md) and, <span id="page_197">p.
197</span> <span id="vi.XIII.XVII-Page_197"></span>Thou, O Lord God, so
commanding, our soul may bud forth works of mercy according to their
kind, <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) —loving our neighbour
in the relief of his bodily necessities, having seed in itself according
to its likeness, when from our infirmity we compassionate even to the
relieving of the needy; helping them in a like manner as we would that
help should be brought unto us if we were in a like need; not only in
the things that are easy, as in “herb yielding seed,” but also in the
protection of our assistance, in our very strength, like the tree
yielding fruit; that is, a good turn in delivering him who suffers an
injury from the hand of the powerful, and in furnishing him with the
shelter of protection by the mighty strength of just judgment.

<span id="vi.XIII.XVII-p3"></span> [Gen.
1.9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.XIII.XVII-p3.1"></span>. In his comment on [Psalm lxiv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006.md)<span id="vi.XIII.XVII-p3.2"></span>
(sec. 9), he interprets “the sea,” allegorically, of the wicked world.
Hence were the disciples called “fishers of men.” If the fishers have
taken us in the nets of faith, we are to rejoice, because the net will
be dragged to the shore. On the providence of God, regulating the
wickedness of men, see p. 79, note 4, above.

above) the *sea* as the world, so he tells us *in Ps.* lxvi. 6, sec. 8,
that when the *earth*, full of thorns, thirsted for the waters of
heaven, God in His mercy sent His apostles to preach the gospel, whereon
the earth brought forth that fruit which fills the world; that is, the
earth bringing forth fruit represents the Church.
