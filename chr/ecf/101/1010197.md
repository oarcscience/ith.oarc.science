<span id="vi.X.XL-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XL-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—The Only Safe Resting-Place for the
Soul is to Be Found in God.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XL-p2"></span>65. Where hast Thou not accompanied me, O
Truth, <span id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) teaching me both what to
avoid and what to desire, when I submitted to Thee what I could perceive
of sublunary things, and asked Thy counsel? With my external senses, as
I could, I viewed the world, and noted the life which my body derives
from me, and these my senses. Thence I advanced inwardly into the
recesses of my memory,—the manifold rooms, wondrously full of
multitudinous wealth; and I considered and was afraid, and could discern
none of these things without Thee, and found none of them to be Thee.
Nor was I myself the discoverer of these things,—I, who went over them
all, and laboured to distinguish and to value everything according to
its dignity, accepting some things upon the report of my senses, and
questioning about others which I felt to be mixed up with myself,
distinguishing and numbering the reporters themselves, and in the vast
storehouse of my memory investigating some things, laying up others,
taking out others. Neither was I myself when I did this (that is, that
ability of mine whereby I did it), nor was it Thou, for Thou art that
never-failing light which I took counsel of as to them all, whether they
were what they were, and what was their worth; and I heard Thee teaching
and commanding me. And this I do often; this is a delight to me, and, as
far as I can get relief from necessary duties, to this gratification do
I resort. Nor in all these which I review when consulting Thee, find I a
secure place for my soul, save in Thee, into whom my scattered members
may be gathered together, and nothing of me depart from Thee. <span
id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md) And sometimes Thou dost introduce me
to a most rare affection, inwardly, to an inexplicable sweetness, which,
if it should be perfected in me, I know not to what point that life
might not arrive. But by these wretched weights <span
id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md) of mine do I relapse into these
things, and am sucked in by my old customs, and am held, and sorrow
much, yet am much held. To such an extent does the burden of habit press
us down. In this way I can be, but will not; in that I will, but
cannot,—on both ways miserable.
