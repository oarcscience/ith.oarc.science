<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p3.1"></span>A Treatise on the Origin of the Human Soul,
Addressed to Jerome.</span>* <span id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md)

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p5"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p5.1"></span>Chap. I.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p6"></span>1. Unto our God, who hath called us
unto His kingdom and glory, <span id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md) I
have prayed, and pray now, that what I write to you, holy brother
Jerome, asking your opinion in regard to things of which I am ignorant,
may by His good pleasure be profitable to us both. For although in
addressing you I consult one much older than myself, nevertheless I also
am becoming old; but I cannot think that it is at anytime of life too
late to learn what we need to know, because, although it is more fitting
that old men should be teachers than learners, it is nevertheless more
fitting for them to learn than to continue ignorant of that which they
should teach to others. I assure you that, amid the many disadvantages
which I have to submit to in studying very difficult questions, there is
none which grieves me more than the circumstance of separation from your
Charity by a distance so great that I can scarcely send a letter to you,
and scarcely receive one from you, even at intervals, not of days nor of
months, but of several years; whereas my desire would be, if it were
possible, to have you daily beside me, as one with whom I could converse
on any theme. Nevertheless, although I have not been able to do all that
I wished, I am not the less bound to do all that I can.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p8"></span>2. Behold, a religious young man has
come to me, by name Orosius, who is in the bond of Catholic peace a
brother, in point of age a son, and in honour a fellow presbyter,—a man,
of quick understanding, ready speech, and burning zeal, desiring to be
in the Lord’s house a vessel rendering useful service in refuting those
false and pernicious doctrines, through which the souls of men in Spain
have suffered much more grievous wounds than have been inflicted on
their bodies by the sword of barbarians. For from the remote western
coast of Spain he has come with eager haste to us, having been prompted
to do this by the report that from me he could learn whatever he wished
on the subjects on which he desired information. Nor has his coming been
altogether in vain. In the first place, he has learned not to believe
all that report affirmed of me: in the next place, I have taught him all
that I could, and, as for the things in which I could not teach him, I
have told him from whom he may learn them, and have exhorted him to go
on to you. As he received this counsel or rather injunction of mine with
pleasure, and with intention to comply with it, I asked him to visit us
on his way home to his own country when he comes from you. On receiving
his promise to this effect, I believed that the Lord had granted me an
opportunity of writing to you regarding certain things which I wish
through you to learn. For I was seeking some one whom I might send to
you, and it was not easy to fall in with one qualified both by
trustworthiness in performing and by alacrity in undertaking the work,
as well as by experience in travelling. Therefore, when I became
acquainted with this young man, I could not doubt that he was exactly
such a person as I was asking from the Lord.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p9"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p9.1"></span>Chap. II.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p10"></span>3. Allow me, therefore, to bring
before you a subject which I beseech you not to refuse to open up and
discuss with me. Many are perplexed by questions concerning the soul,
and I confess that I myself am of this number. I shall in this letter,
in the first place, state explicitly the things regarding the soul which
I most assuredly believe, and shall, in the next place, bring forward
the things regarding which I am still desirous of explanation.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p11"></span>The soul of man is in a sense proper
to itself immortal. It is not absolutely immortal, as God is, of whom it
is written that He “alone hath immortality,” <span
id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) for Holy Scripture makes mention of
deaths to which the soul is liable—as in the saying, “Let the dead bury
their dead;” <span id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md) but because when
alienated from the life of God it so dies as not wholly to cease from
living in its own nature, it is found to be from a certain cause mortal,
yet so as to be not without reason called at the same time immortal.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p14"></span>The soul is not a part of God. For if
it were, it would be absolutely immutable and incorruptible, in which
case it could neither go downward to be worse, nor go onward to be
better; nor could it either begin to have anything in itself which it
had not before, or cease to have any<span id="page_524">p. 524</span>
<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_524"></span>thing which it had within the
sphere of its own experience. But how different the actual facts of the
case are is a point requiring no evidence from without, it is
acknowledged by every one who consults his own consciousness. In vain,
moreover, is it pleaded by those who affirm that the soul is a part of
God, that the corruption and baseness which we see in the worst of men,
and the weakness and blemishes which we see in all men, come to it not
from the soul itself, but from the body; for what matters it whence the
infirmity originates in that which, if it were indeed immutable, could
not, from any quarter whatever, be made infirm? For that which is truly
immutable and incorruptible is not liable to mutation or corruption by
any influence whatever from without, else the invulnerability which the
fable ascribed to the flesh of Achilles would be nothing peculiar to
him, but the property of every man, so long as no accident befell him.
That which is liable to be changed in any manner, by any cause, or in
any part whatever, is therefore not by nature immutable; but it were
impiety to think of God as otherwise than truly and supremely immutable:
therefore the soul is not a part of God.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p15"></span>4. That the soul is immaterial is a
fact of which I avow myself to be fully persuaded, although men of slow
understanding are hard to be convinced that it is so. To secure myself,
however, from either unnecessarily causing to others or unreasonably
bringing upon myself a controversy about an expression, let me say that,
since the thing itself is beyond question, it is needless to contend
about mere terms. If matter be used as a term denoting everything which
in any form has a separate existence, whether it be called an essence,
or a substance, or by another name, the soul is material. Again, if you
choose to apply the epithet immaterial only to that nature which is
supremely immutable and is everywhere present in its entirety, the soul
is material, for it is not at all endowed with such qualities. But if
matter be used to designate nothing but that which, whether at rest or
in motion, has some length, breadth, and height, so that with a greater
part of itself it occupies a greater part of space, and with a smaller
part a smaller space, and is in every part of it less than the whole,
then the soul is not material. For it pervades the whole body which it
animates, not by a local distribution of parts, but by a certain vital
influence, being at the same moment present in its entirety in all parts
of the body, and not less in smaller parts and greater in larger parts,
but here with more energy and there with less energy, it is in its
entirety present both in the whole body and in every part of it. For
even that which the mind perceives in only a part of the body is
nevertheless not otherwise perceived than by the whole mind; for when
any part of the living flesh is touched by a fine pointed instrument,
although the place affected is not only not the whole body, but scarcely
discernible in its surface, the contact does not escape the entire mind,
and yet the contact is felt not over the whole body, but only at the one
point where it takes place. How comes it, then, that what takes place in
only a part of the body is immediately known to the whole mind, unless
the whole mind is present at that part, and at the same time not
deserting all the other parts of the body in order to be present in its
entirety at this one? For all the other parts of the body in which no
such contact takes place are still living by the soul being present with
them. And if a similar contact takes place in the other parts, and the
contact occur in both parts simultaneously, it would in both cases alike
be known at the same moment, to the whole mind. Now this presence of the
mind in all parts of the body at the same moment, so that in every part
of the body the whole mind is at the same moment present, would be
impossible if it were distributed over these parts in the same way as we
see matter distributed in space, occupying less space with a smaller
portion of itself, and greater space with a greater portion. If,
therefore, mind is to be called material, it is not material in the same
sense as earth, water, air, and ether are material. For all things
composed of these elements are larger in larger places, or smaller in
smaller places, and none of them is in its entirety present at any part
of itself, but the dimensions of the material substances are according
to the dimensions of the space occupied. Whence it is perceived that the
soul, whether it be termed material or immaterial, has a certain nature
of its own, created from a substance superior to the elements of this
world,—a substance which cannot be truly conceived of by any
representation of the material images perceived by the bodily senses,
but which is apprehended by the understanding and discovered to our
consciousness by its living energy. These things I am stating, not with
the view of teaching you what you already know, but in order that I may
declare explicitly what I hold as indisputably certain concerning the
soul, lest any one should think, when I come to state the questions to
which I desire answers, that I hold none of the doctrines which we have
learned from science or from revelation concerning the soul.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p16"></span>5. I am, moreover, fully persuaded
that the soul has fallen into sin, not through the fault of God, nor
through any necessity either in the divine nature or in its own, but by
its own free will; and that it can be delivered from the body of this
death neither by the strength of its own will, as if that were in itself
sufficient to achieve <span id="page_525">p. 525</span> <span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_525"></span>this, nor by the death of the body
itself, but only by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus
Christ; <span id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md) and that there is not
one soul in the human family to whose salvation the one Mediator between
God and men, the man Christ Jesus, is not absolutely necessary. Every
soul, moreover, which may at any age whatsoever depart from this life
without the grace of the Mediator and the sacrament of this grace,
departs to future punishment, and shall receive again its own body at
the last judgment as a partner in punishment. But if the soul after its
natural generation, which was derived from Adam, be regenerated in
Christ, it belongs to His fellowship, <span
id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md) and shall not only have rest after
the death of the body, but also receive again its own body as a partner
in glory. These are truths concerning the soul which I hold most firmly.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p19"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p19.1"></span>Chap. III.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p20"></span>6. Permit me now, therefore, to bring
before you the question which I desire to have solved, and do not reject
me; so may He not reject you who condescended to be rejected for our
sakes!

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p21"></span>I ask where can the soul, even of an
infant snatched away by death, have contracted the guilt which, unless
the grace of Christ has come to the rescue by that sacrament of baptism
which is administered even to infants, involves it in condemnation? I
know you are not one of those who have begun of late to utter certain
new and absurd opinions, alleging that there is no guilt derived from
Adam which is removed by baptism in the case of infants. If I knew that
you held this view, or, rather, if I did not know that you reject it, I
would certainly neither address this question to you, nor think that it
ought to be put to you at all. Since, however, we hold on this subject
the opinion consonant with the immoveable Catholic faith, which you have
yourself expressed when, refuting the absurd sayings of Jovinian, you
have quoted this sentence from the book of Job: “In thy sight, no one is
clean, not even the infant, whose time of life on earth is a single
day,” <span id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md) adding, “for we are
held guilty in the similitude of Adam’s transgression,” <span
id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) —an opinion which your book on
Jonah’s prophecy declares in a notable and lucid manner, where you
affirm that the little children of Nineveh were justly compelled to fast
along with the people, because merely of their original sin, <span
id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md) —it is not unsuitable that I should
address to you the question—where has the soul contracted the guilt from
which, even at that age, it must be delivered by the sacrament of
Christian grace?

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p25"></span>7. Some years ago, when I wrote
certain books concerning *Free Will*, which have gone forth into the
hands of many, and are now in the possession of very many readers, after
referring to these four opinions as to the manner of the soul’s
incarnation,—(1) that all other souls are derived from the one which was
given to the first man; (2) that for each individual a new soul is made;
(3) that souls already in existence somewhere are sent by divine act
into the bodies; or (4) glide into them of their own accord, I thought
that it was necessary to treat them in such a way that, whichever of
them might be true, the decision should not hinder the object which I
had in view when contending with all my might against those who attempt
to lay upon God the blame of a nature endowed with its own principle of
evil, namely, the Manichæans; <span id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md)
for at that time I had not heard of the Priscillianists, who utter
blasphemies not very dissimilar to these. As to the fifth opinion,
namely, that the soul is a part of God,—an opinion which, in order to
omit none, you have mentioned along with the rest in your letter to
Marcellinus (a man of pious memory and very dear to us in the grace of
Christ), who had consulted you on this question, <span
id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) —I did not add it to the others for
two reasons, first,—because, in examining this opinion, we discuss not
the incarnation of the soul, but its nature; secondly, because this is
the view held by those against whom I was arguing, and the main design
of my argument was to prove that the blameless and inviolable nature of
the Creator has nothing to do with the faults and blemishes of the
creature, while they, on their part, maintained that the substance of
the good God itself is, in so far as it is led captive, corrupted and
oppressed and brought under a necessity of sinning by the substance of
evil, to which they ascribe a proper dominion and principalities.
Leaving, therefore, out of the question this heretical error, I desire
to know which of the other four opinions we ought to choose. For
whichever of them may justly claim our preference, far be it from us to
assail this article of faith, about which we have no uncertainty, that
every soul, even the soul of an infant, requires to be delivered from
the binding guilt of sin, and that there is no deliverance except
through Jesus Christ and Him crucified.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p28"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p28.1"></span>Chap. IV.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p29"></span>8. To avoid prolixity, therefore, let
me refer to the opinion which you, I believe, entertain, viz. that God
even now makes each soul for each individual at the time of birth. To
meet the objection to this view which might be taken from the fact that
God finished the whole work of creation on the sixth day and rested on
the seventh day, you quote the testimony of the <span id="page_526">p.
526</span> <span id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_526"></span>words in the gospel,
“My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” <span
id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md) This you have written in your
letter to Marcellinus, in which letter, moreover, you have most kindly
condescended to mention my name, saying that he had me here in Africa,
who could more easily explain to him the opinion held by you. <span
id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724.md) But had I been able to do this, he
would not have applied for instruction to you, who were so remote from
him, though perhaps he did not write from Africa to you. For I know not
when he wrote it; I only know that he knew well my hesitation to embrace
any definite view on this subject, for which reason he preferred to
write to you without consulting me. Yet, even if he had consulted me, I
would rather have encouraged him to write to you, and would have
expressed my gratitude for the benefit which might have been conferred
on us all, had you not preferred to send a brief note, instead of a full
reply, doing this, I suppose, to save yourself from unnecessary
expenditure of effort in a place where I, whom you supposed to be
thoroughly acquainted with the subject of his inquiries, was at hand.
Behold, I am willing that the opinion which you hold should be also
mine; but I assure you that as yet I have not embraced it.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p32"></span>9. You have sent to me scholars, to
whom you wish me to impart what I have not yet learned myself. Teach me,
therefore, what I am to teach them; for many urge me vehemently to be a
teacher on this subject, and to them I confess that of this, as well as
of many other things, I am ignorant, and perhaps, though they maintain a
respectful demeanour in my presence, they say among themselves: “Art
thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?” <span
id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725.md) a rebuke which the Lord gave to one
who belonged to the class of men who delighted in being called Rabbi;
which was also the reason of his coming by night to the true Teacher,
because perchance he, who had been accustomed to teach, blushed to take
the learner’s place. But, for my own part, it gives me much more
pleasure to hear instruction from another, than to be myself listened to
as a teacher. For I remember what He said to those whom, above all men,
He had chosen: “But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your master, even
Christ.” <span id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726.md) Nor was it any other
teacher who taught Moses by Jethro, <span
id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727.md) Cornelius by Peter the earlier
apostle, <span id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728.md) and Peter himself by
Paul the later apostle; <span id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729.md) for
by whomsoever truth is spoken, it is spoken by the gift of Him who is
the Truth. What if the reason of our still being ignorant of these
things, and of our having failed to discover them, even after praying,
reading, thinking, and reasoning, be this: that full proof may be made
not only of the love with which we give instruction to the ignorant, but
also of the humility with which we receive instruction from the learned?

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p38"></span>10. Teach me, therefore, I beseech
you, what I may teach to others; teach me what I ought to hold as my own
opinion; and tell me this: if souls are from day to day made for each
individual separately at birth, where, in the case of infant children,
is sin committed by these souls, so that they require the remission of
sin in the sacrament of Christ, because of sinning in Adam from whom the
sinful flesh has been derived? or if they do not sin, how is it
compatible with the justice of the Creator, that, because of their being
united to mortal members derived from another, they are so brought under
the bond of the sin of that other, that unless they be rescued by the
Church, perdition overtakes them, although it is not in their own power
to secure that they be rescued by the grace of baptism? Where,
therefore, is the justice of the condemnation of so many thousands of
souls, which in the deaths of infant children leave this world without
the benefit of the Christian sacrament, if being newly created they
have, not through any preceding sin of their own, but by the will of the
Creator, become severally united to the individual bodies to animate
which they were created and bestowed by Him, who certainly knew that
every one of them was destined, not through any fault of its own, to
leave the body without receiving the baptism of Christ? Seeing,
therefore, that we may not say concerning God either that He compels
them to become sinners, or that He punishes innocent souls and seeing
that, on the other hand, it is not lawful for us to deny that nothing
else than perdition is the doom of the souls, even of little children,
which have departed from the body without the sacrament of Christ, tell
me, I implore you, where anything can be found to support the opinion
that souls are not all derived from that one soul of the first man, but
are each created separately for each individual, as Adam’s soul was made
for him.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p39"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p39.1"></span>Chap. V.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p40"></span>11. As for some other objections which
are advanced against this opinion, I think that I could easily dispose
of them. For example, some think that they urge a conclusive argument
against this opinion when they ask, how God finished all His works an
the sixth day and rested on the seventh day, <span
id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730.md) if He is still creating new souls.
If we meet them with the quotation from the gospel (given by you in
<span id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_527"></span>the letter to Marcellinus already
mentioned), “My Father worketh hitherto,” they answer that He “worketh”
in maintaining those natures which He has created, not in creating new
natures; otherwise, this statement would contradict the words of
Scripture in Genesis, where it is most plainly declared that God
finished all His works. Moreover, the words of Scripture, that He
rested, are unquestionably to be understood of His resting from creating
new creatures, not from governing those which He had created; for at
that time He made things which previously did not exist, and from making
these He rested because He had finished all the creatures which before
they existed He saw necessary to be created, so that thenceforward He
did not create and make things which previously did not exist, but made
and fashioned out of things already existing whatever He did make. Thus
the statements, “He rested from His works,” and, “He worketh hitherto,”
are both true, for the gospel could not contradict Genesis.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p42"></span>12. When, however, these things are
brought forward by persons who advance them as conclusive against the
opinion that God now creates new souls as He created the soul of the
first man, and who hold either that He forms them from that one soul
which existed before He rested from creation, or that He now sends them
forth into bodies from some reservoir or storehouse of souls which He
then created, it is easy to turn aside their argument by answering, that
even in the six days God formed many things out of those natures which
He had already created, as, for example, the birds and fishes were
formed from the waters, and the trees, the grass, and the animals from
the earth, and yet it is undeniable that He was then making things which
did not exist before. For there existed previously no bird, no fish, no
tree, no animal, and it is clearly understood that He rested from
creating those things which previously were not, and were then created,
that is to say, He ceased in this sense, that, after that, nothing was
made by Him which did not already exist. But if, rejecting the opinions
of all who believe either that God sends forth into men souls existing
already in some incomprehensible reservoir, or that He makes souls
emanate like drops of dew from Himself as particles of His own
substance, or that He brings them forth from that one soul of the first
man, or that He binds them in the fetters of the bodily members because
of sins committed in a prior state of existence, if, I say, rejecting
these, we affirm that for each individual He creates separately a new
soul when he is born, we do not herein affirm that He makes anything
which he had not already made. For He had already made man after His own
image on the sixth day; and this work of His is unquestionably to be
understood with reference to the rational soul of man. The same work He
still does, not in creating what did not exist, but in multiplying what
already existed. Wherefore it is true, on the one hand, that He rested
from creating things which previously did not exist, and equally true,
on the other hand, that He continues still to work, not only in
governing what He has made, but also in making (not anything which did
not previously exist, but) a larger number of those creatures which He
had already made. Wherefore, either by such an explanation, or by any
other which may seem better, we escape from the objection advanced by
those who would make the fact that God rested from His works a
conclusive argument against our believing that new souls are still being
daily created, not from the first soul, but in the same manner as it was
made.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p43"></span>13. Again, as for another objection,
stated in the question, “Wherefore does He create souls for those whom
He knows to be destined to an early death?” we may reply, that by the
death of the children the sins of the parents are either reproved or
chastised. We may, moreover, with all propriety, leave these things to
the disposal of the Lord of all, for we know that he appoints to the
succession of events in time, and therefore to the births and deaths of
living creatures as included in these, a course which is consummate in
beauty and perfect in the arrangement of all its parts; whereas we are
not capable of perceiving those things by the perception of which, if it
were attainable, we should be soothed with an ineffable, tranquil joy.
For not in vain has the prophet, taught by divine inspiration, declared
concerning God, “He bringeth forth in measured harmonies the course of
time.” <span id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731.md) For which reason
music, the science or capacity of correct harmony, has been given also
by the kindness of God to mortals having reasonable souls, with a view
to keep them in mind of this great truth. For if a man, when composing a
song which is to suit a particular melody, knows how to distribute the
length of time allowed to each word so as to make the song flow and pass
on in most beautiful adaptation to the ever-changing notes of the
melody, how much more shall God, whose wisdom is to be esteemed as
infinitely transcending human arts, make infallible provision that not
one of the spaces of time alloted to natures that are born and
die—spaces which are like the words and syllables of the successive
epochs of the course of time—shall have, in what we may call the sublime
psalm of the vicissitudes of this world, a duration either more brief or
more protracted than the fore<span id="page_528">p. 528</span> <span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_528"></span>known and predetermined harmony
requires! For when I may speak thus with reference even to the leaves of
every tree, and the number of the hairs upon our heads, how much more
may I say it regarding the birth and death of men, seeing that every
man’s life on earth continues for a time, which is neither longer nor
shorter than God knows to be in harmony with the plan according to which
He rules the universe.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p45"></span>14. As to the assertion that
everything which has begun to exist in time is incapable of immortality,
because all things which are born die, and all things which have grown
decay through age, and the opinion which they affirm to follow
necessarily from this, viz. that the soul of man must owe its
immortality to its having been created before time began, this does not
disturb my faith; for, passing over other examples, which conclusively
dispose of this assertion, I need only refer to the body of Christ,
which now “dieth no more; death shall have no more dominion over
it.” <span id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732.md)

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p47"></span>15. Moreover, as to your remark in
your book against Ruffinus, that some bring forward as against this
opinion that souls are created for each individual separately at birth
the objection that it seems worthy of God that He should give souls to
the offspring of adulterers, and who accordingly attempt to build on
this a theory that souls may possibly be incarcerated, as it were, in
such bodies, to suffer for the deeds of a life spent in some prior state
of being, <span id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md) —this objection
does not disturb me, as many things by which it may be answered occur to
me when I consider it. The answer which you yourself have given, saying,
that in the case of stolen wheat, there is no fault in the grain, but
only in him who stole it, and that the earth is not under obligation to
refuse to cherish the seed because the sower may have cast it in with a
hand defiled by dishonesty, is a most felicitous illustration. But even
before I had read it, I felt that to me the objection drawn from the
offspring of adulterers caused no serious difficulty when I took a
general view of the fact that God brings many good things to light, even
out of our evils and our sins. Now, the creation of any living creature
compels every one who considers it with piety and wisdom to give to the
Creator praise which words cannot express; and if this praise is called
forth by the creation of any living creature whatsoever, how much more
is it called forth by the creation of a man! If, therefore, the cause of
any act of creative power be sought for, no shorter or better reply can
be given than that every creature of God is good. And \[so far from such
an act being unworthy of God\] what is more worthy of Him than that He,
being good, should make those good things which, no one else than God
alone can make?

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p49"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p49.1"></span>Chap. VI.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p50"></span>16. These things, and others which I
can advance, I am accustomed to state, as well as I can, against those
who attempt to overthrow by such objections the opinion that souls are
made for each individual, as the first man’s soul was made for him.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p51"></span>But when we come to the penal
sufferings of infants, I am embarrassed, believe me, by great
difficulties, and am wholly at a loss to find an answer by which they
are solved; and I speak here not only of those punishments in the life
to come, which are involved in that perdition to which they must be
drawn down if they depart from the body without the sacrament of
Christian grace, but also of the sufferings which are to our sorrow
endured by them before our eyes in this present life, and which are so
various, that time rather than examples would fail me if I were to
attempt to enumerate them. They are liable to wasting disease, to
racking pain, to the agonies of thirst and hunger, to feebleness of
limbs, to privation of bodily senses, and to vexing assaults of unclean
spirits. Surely it is incumbent on us to show how it is compatible with
justice that infants suffer all these things without any evil of their
own as the procuring cause. For it would be impious to say, either that
these things take place without God’s knowledge, or that He cannot
resist those who cause them, or that He unrighteously does these things,
or permits them to be done. We are warranted in saying that irrational
animals are given by God to serve creatures possessing a higher nature,
even though they be wicked, as we see most plainly in the gospel that
the swine of the Gadarenes were given to the legion of devils at their
request; but could we ever be warranted in saying this of men? Certainly
not. Man is, indeed, an animal, but an animal endowed with reason,
though mortal. In his members dwells a reasonable soul, which in these
severe afflictions is enduring a penalty. Now God is good, God is just,
God is omnipotent—none but a madman would doubt that he is so; let the
great sufferings, therefore, which infant children experience be
accounted for by some reason compatible with justice. When older people
suffer such trials, we are accustomed, certainly, to say, either that
their worth is being proved, as in Job’s case, or that their wickedness
is being punished, as in Herod’s; and from some examples, which it has
pleased God to make perfectly clear, men are enabled to conjecture the
nature of others which are more obscure; but this is in regard to
persons of mature age. Tell me, therefore, what we must answer in regard
to infant children; is it true that, although they <span
id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_529"></span>suffer so great punishments, there are
no sins in them deserving to be punished? for, of course, there is not
in them at that age any righteousness requiring to be put to the proof.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p52"></span>17. What shall I say, moreover, as to
the \[difficulty which besets the theory of the creation of each soul
separately at the birth of the individual in connection with the\]
diversity of talent in different souls, and especially the absolute
privation of reason in some? This is, indeed, not apparent in the first
stages of infancy, but being developed continuously from the beginning
of life, it becomes manifest in children, of whom some are so slow and
defective in memory that they cannot learn even the letters of the
alphabet, and some (commonly called idiots) so imbecile that they differ
very little from the beasts of the field. Perhaps I am told, in answer
to this, that the bodies are the cause of these imperfections. But
surely the opinion which we wish to see vindicated from objection does
not require us to affirm that the soul chose for itself the body which
so impairs it, and, being deceived in the choice, committed a blunder;
or that the soul, when it was compelled, as a necessary consequence of
being born, to enter into some body, was hindered from finding another
by crowds of souls occupying the other bodies before it came, so that,
like a man who takes whatever seat may remain vacant for him in a
theatre, the soul was guided in taking possession of the imperfect body
not by its choice, but by its circumstances. We, of course, cannot say
and ought not to believe such things. Tell us, therefore, what we ought
to believe and to say in order to vindicate from this difficulty the
theory that for each individual body a new soul is specially created.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p53"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p53.1"></span>Chap. VII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p54"></span>18. In my books on *Free Will*,
already referred to, I have said something, not in regard to the variety
of capacities in different souls, but, at least, in regard to the pains
which infant children suffer in this life. The nature of the opinion
which I there expressed, and the reason why it is insufficient for the
purposes of our present inquiry, I will now submit to you, and will put
into this letter a copy of the passage in the third book to which I
refer. It is as follows:—“In connection with the bodily sufferings
experienced by the little children who, by reason of their tender age,
have no sins—if the souls which animate them did not exist before they
were born into the human family—a more grievous and, as it were,
compassionate complaint is very commonly made in the remark, ‘What evil
have they done that they should suffer these things?’ as if there could
be a meritorious innocence in any one before the time at which it is
possible for him to do anything wrong! Moreover, if God accomplishes, in
any measure, the correction of the parents when they are chastised by
the sufferings or by the death of the children that are dear to them, is
there any reason why these things should not take place, seeing that,
after they are passed, they will be, to those who experienced them, as
if they had never been, while the persons on whose account they were
inflicted will either become better, being moved by the rod of temporal
afflictions to choose a better mode of life, or be left without excuse
under the punishment awarded at the coming judgment, if, notwithstanding
the sorrows of this life, they have refused to turn their desires
towards eternal life? Morever, who knows what may be given to the little
children by means of whose sufferings the parents have their obdurate
hearts subdued, or their faith exercised, or their compassion proved?
Who knows what good recompense God may, in the secret of his judgments,
reserve for these little ones? For although they have done no righteous
action, nevertheless, being free from any transgression of their own,
they have suffered these trials. It is certainly not without reason that
the Church exalts to the honourable rank of martyrs those children who
were slain when Herod sought our Lord Jesus Christ to put Him to
death.” <span id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md)

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p56"></span>19. These things I wrote at that time
when I was endeavouring to defend the opinion which is now under
discussion. For, as I mentioned shortly before, I was labouring to prove
that whichever of these four opinions regarding the soul’s incarnation
may be found true, the substance of the Creator is absolutely free from
blame, and is completely removed from all share in our sins. And,
therefore, whichever of these opinions might come to be established or
demolished by the truth, this had no bearing on the object aimed at in
the work which I was then attempting, seeing that whichever opinion
might win the victory over all the rest, after they had been examined in
a more thorough discussion, this would take place without causing me any
disquietude, because my object then was to prove that, even admitting
all these opinions, the doctrine maintained by me remained unshaken. But
now my object is, by the force of sound reasoning, to select, if
possible, one opinion out of the four; and, therefore, when I carefully
consider the words now quoted from that book, I do not see that the
arguments there used in defending the opinion which we are now
discussing are valid and conclusive.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p57"></span>20. For what may be called the chief
prop of my defence is in the sentence, “Moreover, who knows what may be
given to the little children, by means of whose sufferings the parents
have <span id="page_530">p. 530</span> <span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_530"></span>their obdurate hearts subdued, or their
faith exercised, or their compassion proved? Who knows what good
recompense God may, in the secret of His judgments, reserve for these
little ones?” I see that this is not an unwarranted conjecture in the
case of infants who, in any way, suffer (though they know it not) for
the sake of Christ and in the cause of true religion, and of infants who
have already been made partakers of the sacrament of Christ; because,
apart from union to the one Mediator, they cannot be delivered from
condemnation, and so put in a position in which it is even possible that
a recompense could be made to them for the evils which, in diverse
afflictions, they have endured in this world. But since the question
cannot be fully solved, unless the answer include also the case of those
who, without having received the sacrament of Christian fellowship, die
in infancy after enduring the most painful sufferings, what recompense
can be conceived of in their case, seeing that, besides all that they
suffer in this life, perdition awaits them in the life to come? As to
the baptism of infants, I have, in the same book, given an answer, not,
indeed, fully, but so far as seemed necessary for the work which then
occupied me, proving that it profits children, even though they do not
know what it is, and have, as yet, no faith of their own; but on the
subject of the perdition of those infants who depart from this life
without baptism, I did not think it necessary to say anything then,
because the question under discussion was different from that with which
we are now engaged.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p58"></span>21. If, however, we pass over and make
no account of those sufferings which are of brief continuance, and
which, when endured, are not to be repeated, we certainly cannot, in
like manner, make no account of the fact that “by one man death came,
and by one man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam
all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” <span
id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735.md) For, according to this apostolical,
divine, and perspicuous declaration, it is sufficiently plain that no
one goes to death otherwise than through Adam, and that no one goes to
life eternal otherwise than through Christ. For this is the force of
*all* in the two parts of the sentence; as all men, by their first, that
is, their natural birth, belong to Adam, even so all men, whoever they
be, who come to Christ come to the second, that is, the spiritual birth.
For this reason, therefore, the word *all* is used in both clauses,
because as all who die do not die otherwise than in Adam, so all who
shall be made alive shall not be made alive otherwise than in Christ.
Wherefore whosoever tells us that any man can be made alive in the
resurrection of the dead otherwise than in Christ, he is to be detested
as a pestilent enemy to the common faith. Likewise, whosoever says that
those children who depart out of this life without partaking of that
sacrament shall be made alive in Christ, certainly contradicts the
apostolic declaration, and condemns the universal Church, in which it is
the practice to lose no time and run in haste to administer baptism to
infant children, because it is believed, as an indubitable truth, that
otherwise they cannot be made alive in Christ. Now he that is not made
alive in Christ must necessarily remain under the condemnation, of which
the apostle says, that “by the offence of one judgment came upon all men
to condemnation.” <span id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736.md) That
infants are born under the guilt of this offence is believed by the
whole Church. It is also a doctrine which you have most faithfully set
forth, both in your treatise against Jovinian and your exposition of
Jonah, as I mentioned above, and, if I am not mistaken, in other parts
of your works which I have not read or have at present forgotten. I
therefore ask, what is the ground of this condemnation of unbaptized
infants? For if new souls are made for men, individually, at their
birth, I do not see, on the one hand, that they could have any sin while
yet in infancy, nor do I believe, on the other hand, that God condemns
any soul which He sees to have no sin.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p61"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p61.1"></span>Chap. VIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p62"></span>22. Are we perchance to say, in answer
to this, that in the infant the body alone is the cause of sin; but that
for each body a new soul is made, and that if this soul live according
to the precepts of God, by the help of the grace of Christ, the reward
of being made incorruptible may be secured for the body itself, when
subdued and kept under the yoke; and that inasmuch as the soul of an
infant cannot yet do this, unless it receive the sacrament of Christ,
that which could not yet be obtained for the body by the holiness of the
soul is obtained for it by the grace of this sacrament; but if the soul
of an infant depart without the sacrament, it shall itself dwell in life
eternal, from which it could not be separated, as it had no sin, while,
however, the body which it occupied shall not rise again in Christ,
because the sacrament had not been received before its death?

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p63"></span>23. This opinion I have never heard or
read anywhere. I have, however, certainly heard and believed the
statement which led me to speak thus, namely, “The hour is coming, in
the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall
come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of
life,”—the resurrection, namely, of which it is said that “by one man
came the resurrection of the dead,” and in which “all shall be made
alive in Christ,”—“and they <span id="page_531">p. 531</span> <span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_531"></span>that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation.” <span id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737.md)
Now, what is to be understood regarding infants which, before they could
do good or evil, have quitted the body without baptism? Nothing is said
here concerning them. But if the bodies of these infants shall not rise
again, because they have never done either good or evil, the bodies of
the infants that have died after receiving the grace of baptism shall
also have no resurrection, because they also were not in this life able
to do good or evil. If, however, these are to rise among the saints,
*i.e.* among those who have done good, among whom shall the others rise
again but among those who have done evil—unless we are to believe that
some human souls shall not receive, either in the resurrection of life,
or in the resurrection of damnation, the bodies which they lost in
death? This opinion, however, is condemned, even before it is formally
refuted, by its absolute novelty; and besides this, who could bear to
think that those who run with their infant children to have them
baptized, are prompted to do so by a regard for their bodies, not for
their souls? The blessed Cyprian, indeed, said, in order to correct
those who thought that an infant should not be baptized before the
eighth day, that it was not the body but the soul which behoved to be
saved from perdition—in which statement he was not inventing any new
doctrine, but preserving the firmly established faith of the Church; and
he, along with some of his colleagues in the episcopal office, held that
a child may be properly baptized immediately after its birth. <span
id="fr_2738"></span>[2739](#fn_2738.md)

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p66"></span>24. Let every man, however, believe
anything which commends itself to his own judgment, even though it run
counter to some opinion of Cyprian, who may not have seen in the matter
what should have been seen. But let no man believe anything which runs
counter to the perfectly unambiguous apostolical declaration, that by
the offence of one all are brought into condemnation, and that from this
condemnation nothing sets men free but the grace of God through our Lord
Jesus Christ, in whom alone life is given to all who are made alive. And
let no man believe anything which runs counter to the firmly grounded
practice of the Church, in which, if the sole reason for hastening the
administration of baptism were to save the children, the dead as well as
the living would be brought to be baptized.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p67"></span>25. These things being so, it is
necessary still to investigate and to make known the reason why, if
souls are created new for every individual at his birth, those who die
in infancy without the sacrament of Christ are doomed to perdition; for
that they are doomed to this if they so depart from the body is
testified both by Holy Scripture and by the holy Church. Wherefore, as
to that opinion of yours concerning the creation of new souls, if it
does not contradict this firmly grounded article of faith, let it be
mine also; but if it does, let it be no longer yours.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p68"></span>26. Let it not be said to me that we
ought to receive as supporting this opinion the words of Scripture in
Zechariah, “He formeth the spirit of man within him,” <span
id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739.md) and in the book of Psalms, “He
formeth their hearts severally.” <span
id="fr_2740"></span>[2741](#fn_2740.md) We must seek for the strongest and
most indisputable proof, that we may not be compelled to believe that
God is a judge who condemns any soul which has no fault. For to create
signifies either as much or, probably, more than to form \[*fingere*\];
nevertheless it is written, “Create in me a clean heart, O God,” <span
id="fr_2741"></span>[2742](#fn_2741.md) and yet it cannot be supposed that
a soul here expresses a desire to be made before it has begun to exist.
Therefore, as it is a soul already existing which is created by being
renewed in righteousness, so it is a soul already existing which is
formed by the moulding power of doctrine. Nor is your opinion, which I
would willingly make my own, supported by that sentence in Ecclesiastes,
“Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall
return to God who gave it.” <span id="fr_2742"></span>[2743](#fn_2742.md)
Nay, it rather favours those who think that all souls are derived from
one; for they say that, as the dust returns to the earth as it was, and
yet the body of which this is said returns not to the man from whom it
was derived, but to the earth from which the first man was made, the
spirit in like manner, though derived from the spirit of the first man,
does not return to him but to the Lord, by whom it was given to our
first parent. Since, however, the testimony of this passage in their
favour is not so decisive as to make it appear altogether opposed to the
opinion which I shall gladly see vindicated, I thought proper to submit
these remarks on it to your judgment, to prevent you from endeavouring
to deliver me from my perplexities by quoting passages such as these.
For although no man’s wishes can make that true which is not true,
nevertheless, were this possible, I would wish that this opinion should
be true, as I do wish that, if it is true, it should be most clearly and
unanswerably vindicated by you.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p73"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p73.1"></span>Chap. IX.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p74"></span>27. The same difficulty attends those
also who hold that souls already existing elsewhere, and prepared from
the beginning of the works of God, are sent by Him into bodies. For to
these persons also the same question may <span id="page_532">p.
532</span> <span id="vii.1.CLXVI-Page_532"></span>be put: If these
souls, being without any fault, go obediently to the bodies to which
they are sent, why are they subjected to punishment in the case of
infants, if they come without being baptized to the end of this life?
The same difficulty unquestionably attaches to both opinions. Those who
affirm that each soul is, according to the deserts of its actions in an
earlier state of being, united to the body alloted to it in this life,
imagine that they escape more easily from this difficulty. For they
think that to “die in Adam” means to suffer punishment in that flesh
which is derived from Adam, from which condition of guilt the grace of
Christ, they say, delivers the young as well as the old. So far, indeed,
they teach what is right, and true, and excellent, when they say that
the grace of Christ delivers the young as well as the old from the guilt
of sins. But that souls sin in another earlier life, and that for their
sins in that state of being they are cast down into bodies as prisons, I
do not believe: I reject and protest against such an opinion. I do this,
in the first place, because they affirm that this is accomplished by
means of some incomprehensible revolutions, so that after I know not how
many cycles the soul must return again to the same burden of corruptible
flesh and to the endurance of punishment,—than which opinion I do not
know that anything more horrible could be conceived. In the next place,
who is the righteous man gone from the earth about whom we should not
(if what they say is true) feel afraid lest, sinning in Abraham’s bosom,
he should be cast down into the flames which tormented the rich man in
the parable? <span id="fr_2743"></span>[2744](#fn_2743.md) For why may the
soul not sin after leaving the body, if it can sin before entering it?
Finally, to have sinned in Adam (in regard to which the apostle says
that in him all have sinned) is one thing, but it is a wholly different
thing to have sinned, I know not where, outside of Adam, and then
because of this to be thrust into Adam—that is, into the body, which is
derived from Adam, as into a prison-house. As to the other opinion
mentioned above, that all souls are derived from one, I will not begin
to discuss it unless I am under necessity to do so; and my desire is,
that if the opinion which we are now discussing is true, it may be so
vindicated by you that there shall be no longer any necessity for
examining the other.

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p76"></span>28. Although, however, I desire and
ask, and with fervent prayers wish and hope, that by you the Lord may
remove my ignorance on this subject, if, after all, I am found unworthy
to obtain this, I will beg the grace of patience from the Lord our God,
in whom we have such faith, that even if there be some things which He
does not open to us when we knock, we know it would be wrong to murmur
in the least against Him. I remember what He said to the apostles
themselves: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear
them now.” <span id="fr_2744"></span>[2745](#fn_2744.md) Among these
things, so far at least as I am concerned, let me still reckon this, and
let me guard against being angry that I am deemed unworthy to possess
this knowledge, lest by such anger I be all the more clearly proved to
be unworthy. I am equally ignorant of many other things, yea, of more
than I could name or even number; and of this I would be more patiently
ignorant, were it not that I fear lest some one of these opinions,
involving the contradiction of truth which we most assuredly believe,
should insinuate itself into the minds of the unwary. Meanwhile, though
I do not yet know which of these opinions is to be preferred, this one
thing I profess as my deliberate conviction, that the opinion which is
true does not conflict with that most firm and well grounded article in
the faith of the Church of Christ, that infant children, even when they
are newly born, can be delivered from perdition in no other way than
through the grace of Christ’s name, which He has given in His
sacraments.

id="vii.1.CLXVI-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXVI-p4"></span> The following passage from the
*Retractations of Augustin* (Book ii. ch. xlv.) is quoted by the
Benedictine Fathers as a preface to this letter and the one immediately
succeeding:—“I wrote also two books to Presbyter Jerome, the recluse of
Bethlehem \[sedentem in Bethlehem\]; the one on the origin of the human
soul, the other on the sentence of the Apostle James, ‘Whosoever shall
keep the whole law and offend in one point, he is guilty of all’ ([Jas.
2.10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.1.CLXVI-p4.1"></span>), asking his opinion on both subjects. In
the former letter I did not give any answer of my own to the question
which I proposed; in the latter I did not keep back what seemed to me
the best way to solve the question, but asked whether the same solution
commended itself to his judgment. He wrote in return, expressing
approbation of my submitting the questions to him, but saying that he
had not leisure to send me a reply. So long as he lived, therefore, I
refused to give these books to the world, lest he should perhaps at any
time reply to them, in which case I would have rather published them
along with his answer. After his decease, however, I published them,—the
former, in order to admonish any who read it, either to forbear
altogether from inquiring into the manner in which a soul is given to
infants at the time of birth, or, at all events, in a matter so involved
in obscurity, to accept only such a solution of the question as does not
contradict the clearest truths which the Catholic faith confesses in
regard to original sin in infants, as undoubtedly doomed to perdition
unless they be regenerated in Christ; the latter in order that what
seemed to us the true answer to the question therein discussed might be
known. The work begins with the words, ‘Deum nostrum qui nos vocavit.’ ”
