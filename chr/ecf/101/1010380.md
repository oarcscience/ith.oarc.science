id="vii.1.LXXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXIV.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXIV-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 404.)

<span id="vii.1.LXXIV-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXIV-p3.1"></span>To My Lord Præsidius, Most Blessed, My
Brother and Partner in the Priestly Office, Truly Esteemed, Augustin
Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXIV-p4"></span>1. I write to remind you of the request
which I made to you as a sincere friend when you were here, that you
would not refuse to send a letter of mine to our holy brother and
fellow-presbyter Jerome; in order, moreover, to let your Charity know in
what terms you ought to write to him on my behalf. I have sent a copy of
my letter to him, and of his to me, by reading which your pious wisdom
may easily see both the moderation of tone which I have been careful to
preserve, and the vehemence on his part by which I have been not
unreasonably filled with fear. If, however, I have written anything
which I ought not to have written, or have expressed myself in an
unbecoming way, let it not be to him, but to myself, in brotherly love,
that you send your opinion of what I have done, in order that, if I am
convinced of my fault by your rebuke, I may ask his forgiveness.
