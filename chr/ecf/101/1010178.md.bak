<span id="vi.X.XXI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XXI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—How a Happy Life May Be Retained
in the Memory.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXI-p2"></span>30. But is it so as one who has seen
Carthage remembers it? No. For a happy life is not visible to the eye,
because it is not a body. Is it, then, as we remember numbers? No. For
he that hath these in his knowledge strives not to attain further; but a
happy life we have in our knowledge, and, therefore, do we love it,
while yet we wish further to attain it that we may be happy. Is it,
then, as we remember eloquence? No. For although some, when they hear
this name, call the thing to mind, who, indeed, are not yet eloquent,
and many <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span
id="vi.X.XXI-Page_151"></span>who wish to be so, whence it appears to be
in their knowledge; yet have these by their bodily perceptions noticed
that others are eloquent, and been delighted with it, and long to be
so,—although they would not be delighted save for some interior
knowledge, nor desire to be so unless they were delighted,—but a happy
life we can by no bodily perception make experience of in others. Is it,
then, as we remember joy? It may be so; for my joy I remember, even when
sad, like as I do a happy life when I am miserable. Nor did I ever with
perception of the body either see, hear, smell, taste, or touch my joy;
but I experienced it in my mind when I rejoiced; and the knowledge of it
clung to my memory, so that I can call it to mind sometimes with disdain
and at others with desire, according to the difference of the things
wherein I now remember that I rejoiced. For even from unclean things
have I been bathed with a certain joy, which now calling to mind, I
detest and execrate; at other times, from good and honest things, which,
with longing, I call to mind, though perchance they be not nigh at hand,
and then with sadness do I call to mind a former joy.

<span id="vi.X.XXI-p3"></span>31. Where and when, then, did I experience
my happy life, that I should call it to mind, and love and long for it?
Nor is it I alone or a few others who wish to be happy, but truly all;
which, unless by certain knowledge we knew, we should not wish with so
certain a will. But how is this, that if two men be asked whether they
would wish to serve as soldiers one, it may be, would reply that he
would, the other that he would not; but if they were asked whether they
would wish to be happy, both of them would unhesitatingly say that they
would; and this one would wish to serve, and the other not, from no
other motive but to be happy? Is it, perchance, that as one joys in
this, and another in that, so do all men agree in their wish for
happiness, as they would agree, were they asked, in wishing to have
joy,—and this joy they call a happy life? Although, then, one pursues
joy in this way, and another in that, all have one goal, which they
strive to attain, namely, to have joy. This life, being a thing which no
one can say he has not experienced, it is on that account found in the
memory, and recognised whenever the name of a happy life is heard.
