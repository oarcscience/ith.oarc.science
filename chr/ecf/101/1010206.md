id="vi.XI.V-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—God Created the World Not from Any
Certain Matter, But in His Own Word.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.V-p2"></span>7. But how didst Thou make the heaven and
the earth, and what was the instrument of Thy so mighty work? For it was
not as a human worker fashioning body from body, according to the fancy
of his mind, in somewise able to assign a form which it perceives in
itself by its inner eye. <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026) And
whence should he be able to do this, hadst not Thou made that mind? And
he assigns to it already existing, and as it were having a being, a
form, as clay, or stone, or wood, or gold, or such like. And whence
should these things be, hadst not Thou appointed them? Thou didst make
for the workman his body,—Thou the mind commanding the limbs,—Thou the
matter whereof he makes anything, <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027) —Thou the capacity whereby he may
apprehend his art, and see within what he may do without,—Thou the sense
of his body, by which, as by an interpreter, he may from mind unto
matter convey that which he doeth, and report to his mind what may have
been done, that it within may consult the truth, presiding over itself,
whether it be well done. All these things praise Thee, the Creator of
all. But how dost Thou make them? How, O God, didst Thou make heaven and
earth? Truly, neither in the heaven nor in the earth didst Thou make
heaven and earth; nor in the air, nor in the waters, since these also
belong to the heaven and the earth; nor in the whole world didst Thou
make the whole world; because there was no place wherein it could be
made before it was made, that it might be; nor didst Thou hold anything
in Thy hand wherewith to make heaven and earth. For whence couldest Thou
have what Thou hadst not made, whereof to make anything? For what is,
save because Thou art? Therefore Thou didst speak and they were
made, <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028) and in Thy Word Thou
madest these things. <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029)

<span id="vi.XI.V-p4"></span> That is, the artificer makes, God creates.
The creation of matter is distinctively a doctrine of revelation. The
ancient philosophers believed in the eternity of matter. As Lucretius
puts it (i. 51): “Nullam rem e nihilo gigni divinitus unquam.” See
Burton, *Bampton Lectures*, lect. iii. and notes 18–21, and Mansel,
*Bampton Lectures*, lect. iii. note 12. See also p. 76, note 8, above,
