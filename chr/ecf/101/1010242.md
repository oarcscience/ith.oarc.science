id="vi.XII.IX-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—That the Heaven of Heavens Was an
Intellectual Creature, But that the Earth Was Invisible and Formless
Before the Days that It Was Made.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.IX-p2"></span>9. And therefore the Spirit, the Teacher
of Thy servant <span id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) when He
relates that Thou didst in the Beginning create heaven and earth, is
silent as to times, silent as to days. For, doubtless, that heaven of
heavens, which Thou in the Beginning didst create, is some intellectual
creature, which, although in no wise co-eternal unto Thee, the Trinity,
is yet a partaker of Thy eternity, and by reason of the sweetness of
that most happy contemplation of Thyself, doth greatly restrain its own
mutability, and without any failure, from the time in which it was
created, in clinging unto Thee, surpasses all the rolling change of
times. But this shapelessness—this earth invisible and without form—has
not itself been numbered among the days. For where there is no shape nor
order, nothing either cometh or goeth; and where this is not, there
certainly are no days, nor any vicissitude of spaces of times.
