<span id="vi.XIII.XXX-p2"></span>45. And I heard, O Lord my God, and
drank up a drop of sweetness from Thy truth, and understood that there
are certain men to whom Thy works are displeasing, who say that many of
them Thou madest being compelled by necessity;—such as the fabric of the
heavens and the courses of the stars, and that Thou madest them not of
what was Thine, but, that they were elsewhere and from other sources
created; that Thou mightest bring together and compact and interweave,
when from Thy conquered enemies Thou raisedst up the walls of the
universe, that they, bound down by this structure, might not be able a
second time to rebel against Thee. But, as to other things, they say
Thou neither madest them nor compactedst them,—such as all flesh and all
very minute creatures, and whatsoever holdeth the earth by its roots;
but that a mind hostile unto Thee and another nature not created by
Thee, and in everywise contrary unto Thee, did, in these lower places of
the world, beget and frame these things. <span

since they see not Thy works through Thy Spirit, nor recognise Thee in
them.
