<span id="vi.IV.IV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IV.IV-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Sorely Distressed by Weeping at
the Death of His Friend, He Provides Consolation for Himself.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.IV-p2"></span>7. In those years, when I first began to
teach rhetoric in my native town, I had acquired a very dear friend,
from association in our studies, of mine own age, and, like myself, just
rising up into the flower of youth. He had grown up with me from
childhood, and we had been both school-fellows and play-fellows. But he
was not then my friend, nor, indeed, afterwards, as true friendship is;
for true it is not but in such as Thou bindest together, cleaving unto
Thee by that love which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,
which is given unto us. <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283) But yet
it was too sweet, being ripened by the fervour of similar studies. For,
from the true faith (which he, as a youth, had not soundly and
thoroughly become master of), I had turned him aside towards those
superstitious and pernicious fables which my mother mourned in me. With
me this man’s mind now erred, nor could my soul exist without him. But
behold, Thou wert close behind Thy fugitives—at once God of
vengeance <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284) and Fountain of
mercies, who turnest us to Thyself by wondrous means. Thou removedst
that man from this life when he had scarce completed one whole year of
my friendship, sweet to me above all the sweetness of that my life.

<span id="vi.IV.IV-p5"></span>8. “Who can show forth all Thy
praise” <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285) which he hath
experienced in himself alone? What was it that Thou didst then, O my
God, and how unsearchable are the depths of Thy judgments! <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286) For when, sore sick of a fever, he
long lay unconscious in a death-sweat, and all despaired of his
recovery, he was baptized without his knowledge; <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287) myself meanwhile little caring,
presuming that his soul would retain rather what it had imbibed from me,
than what was done to his unconscious body. Far different, however, was
it, for he was revived and restored. Straightway, as soon as I could
talk to him (which I could as soon as he was able, for I never left him,
and we hung too much upon each other), I attempted to jest with him, as
if he also would jest with me at that baptism which he had received when
mind and senses were in abeyance, but had now learnt that he had
received. But he shuddered at me, as if I were his enemy; and, with a
remarkable and unexpected freedom, admonished me, if I desired to
continue his friend, to desist from speaking to him in such a way. I,
confounded and confused, concealed all my emotions, till he should get
well, and his health be strong enough to allow me to deal with him as I
wished. But he was withdrawn from my frenzy, that with Thee he might be
preserved for my comfort. A few days after, during my absence, he had a
return of the fever, and died.

<span id="vi.IV.IV-p9"></span>9. At this sorrow my heart was utterly
darkened, and whatever I looked upon was death. My native country was a
torture to me, and my father’s house a wondrous unhappiness; and
whatsoever I had participated in with him, wanting him, turned into a
frightful torture. Mine eyes sought him everywhere, but he was not
granted them; and I hated all places because he was not in them; nor
could they now say to me, “Behold; he is coming,” as they did when he
was alive and absent. I <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="vi.IV.IV-Page_71"></span>became a great puzzle to myself, and asked
my soul why she was so sad, and why she so exceedingly disquieted
me; <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288) but she knew not what to
answer me. And if I said, “Hope thou in God,” <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289) she very properly obeyed me not;
because that most dear friend whom she had lost was, being man, both
truer and better than that phantasm <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290) she was bid to hope in. Naught but
tears were sweet to me, and they succeeded my friend in the dearest of
my affections.

<span id="vi.IV.IV-p12"></span> The mind may rest in theories and
abstractions, but the heart craves a being that it can love; and
Archbishop Whately has shown in one of his essays that the idol worship
of every age had doubtless its origin in the craving of mind and heart
for an embodiment of the object of worship. “Show us the Father, and it
sufficeth us,” says Philip ([John
14.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008)<span
id="vi.IV.IV-p12.1"></span>), and he expresses the longing of the soul;
and when the Lord replies, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father,”
He reveals to us God’s satisfaction of human wants in the incarnation of
His Son. Augustin’s heart was now thrown in upon itself, and his view of
God gave him no consolation. It satisfied his mind, perhaps, in a
measure, to think of God as a “corporeal brightness” (see iii. 12; iv.
3, 12, 31; v. 19, etc.) when free from trouble, but it could not satisfy
him now. He had yet to learn of Him who is the very image of God—who by
His divine power raised the dead to life again, while, with perfect
human sympathy, He could “weep with those that wept,”—the “Son of Man”
(not of a man, He being miraculously born, but of the race of men
\[<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.IV.IV-p12.2"></span>ἀνθρῶπου</span>\]), *i.e.* the Son of
Mankind. See also viii. sec. 27, note, below.
