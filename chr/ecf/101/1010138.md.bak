<span id="vi.VIII.VIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VIII.VIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Conversation with
Alypius Being Ended, He Retires to the Garden, Whither His Friend
Follows Him.</span>

<span id="vi.VIII.VIII-p2"></span>19. In the midst, then, of this great
strife of my inner dwelling, which I had strongly raised up against my
soul in the chamber of my heart, <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md)
troubled both in mind and countenance, I seized upon Alypius, and
exclaimed: “What is wrong with us? What is this? What heardest thou? The
unlearned start up and ‘take’ heaven, <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) and we, with our learning, but wanting
heart, see where we wallow in flesh and blood! Because others have
preceded us, are we ashamed to follow, and not rather ashamed at not
following?” Some such words I gave utterance to, and in my excitement
flung myself from him, while he gazed upon me in silent astonishment.
For I spoke not in my wonted tone, and my brow, cheeks, eyes, colour,
tone of voice, all expressed my emotion more than the words. There was a
little garden belonging to our lodging, of which we had the use, as of
the whole house; for the master, our landlord, did not live there.
Thither had the tempest within my breast hurried me, where no one might
impede the fiery struggle in which I was engaged with myself, until it
came to the issue that Thou knewest, though I did not. But I was mad
that I might be whole, and dying that I might have life, knowing what
evil thing I was, but not knowing what good thing I was shortly to
become. Into the garden, then, I retired, Alypius following my steps.
For his presence was no bar to my solitude; or how could he desert me so
troubled? We sat down at as great a distance from the house as we could.
I was disquieted in spirit, being most impatient with myself that I
entered not into Thy will and covenant, O my God, which all my bones
cried out unto me to enter, extolling it to the skies. And we enter not
therein by ships, or chariots, or feet, no, nor by going so far as I had
come from the house to that place where we were sitting. For not to go
only, but to enter there, was naught else but to will to go, but to will
it resolutely and thoroughly; not to stagger and sway about this way and
that, a changeable and half-wounded will, wrestling, with one part
falling as another rose.

<span id="vi.VIII.VIII-p5"></span><span id="page_125">p. 125</span>
<span id="vi.VIII.VIII-Page_125"></span>20. Finally, in the very fever
of my irresolution, I made many of those motions with my body which men
sometimes desire to do, but cannot, if either they have not the limbs,
or if their limbs be bound with fetters, weakened by disease, or
hindered in any other way. Thus, if I tore my hair, struck my forehead,
or if, entwining my fingers, I clasped my knee, this I did because I
willed it. But I might have willed and not done it, if the power of
motion in my limbs had not responded. So many things, then, I did, when
to have the will was not to have the power, and I did not that which
both with an unequalled desire I longed more to do, and which shortly
when I should will I should have the power to do; because shortly when I
should will, I should will thoroughly. For in such things the power was
one with the will, and to will was to do, and yet was it not done; and
more readily did the body obey the slightest wish of the soul in the
moving its limbs at the order of the mind, than the soul obeyed itself
to accomplish in the will alone this its great will.
