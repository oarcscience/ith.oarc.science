id="vi.XI.XXI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—How Time May Be Measured.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XXI-p2"></span>27. I have just now said, then, that we
measure times as they pass, that we may be able to say that this time is
twice as much as that one, or that this is only as much as that, and so
of any other of the parts of time which we are able to tell by
measuring. Wherefore, as I said, we measure times as they pass. And if
any one should ask me, “Whence dost thou know?” I can answer, “I know,
because we measure; nor can we measure things that are not; and things
past and future are not.” But how do we measure present time, since it
hath not space? It is measured while it passeth; but when it shall have
passed, it is not measured; for there will not be aught that can be
measured. But whence, in what way, and whither doth it pass while it is
being measured? Whence, but from the future? Which way, save through the
present? Whither, but into the past? From that, therefore, which as yet
is not, through that which hath no space, into that which now is not.
But what do we measure, unless time in some space? For we say not
single, and double, and triple, and equal, or in any other way in which
we speak of time, unless with respect to the spaces of times. In what
space, then, do we measure passing time? Is it in the future, whence it
passeth over? But what yet we measure not, is not. Or is it in the
present, by which it passeth? But no space, we do not measure. Or in the
past, whither it passeth? But that which is not now, we measure not.
