id="vi.XII.VIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Heaven and Earth Were Made
“In the Beginning;” Afterwards the World, During Six Days, from
Shapeless Matter.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.VIII-p2"></span>8. But that heaven of heavens was for
Thee, O Lord; but the earth, which Thou hast given to the sons of
men, <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) to be seen and touched,
was not such as now we see and touch. For it was invisible and “without
form,” <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) and there was a deep
over which there was not light; or, darkness was over the deep, that is,
more than in the deep. For this deep of waters, now visible, has, even
in its depths, a light suitable to its nature, perceptible in some
manner unto fishes and creeping things in the bottom of it. But the
entire deep was almost nothing, since hitherto it was altogether
formless; yet there was then that which could be formed. For Thou, O
Lord, hast made the world of a formless matter, which matter, out of
nothing, Thou hast made almost nothing, out of which to make those great
things which we, sons of men, wonder at. For very wonderful is this
corporeal heaven, of which firmament, between water and water, the
second day after the creation of light, Thou saidst, Let it be made, and
it was made. <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) Which firmament
Thou calledst heaven, that is, the heaven of this earth and sea, which
Thou madest on the third day, by giving a visible shape to the formless
matter which Thou madest before all days. For even already hadst Thou
made a heaven before all days, but that was the heaven of this heaven;
because in the beginning Thou hadst made heaven and earth. But the earth
itself which Thou hadst made was formless matter, because it was
invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the deep. Of which
invisible and formless earth, of which formlessness, of which almost
nothing, Thou mightest make all these things of which this changeable
world consists, and yet consisteth not; whose very changeableness
appears in this, that times can be observed and numbered in it. Because
times are made by the changes of things, while the shapes, whose matter
is the invisible earth aforesaid, are varied and turned.
