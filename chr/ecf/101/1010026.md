Shows, He Neglects His Studies and the Injunctions of His
Parents.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.X-p3"></span>16. And yet I erred, O Lord God, the
Creator and Disposer of all things in Nature,—but of sin the Disposer
only,—I erred, O Lord my God, in doing contrary to the wishes of my
parents and of those masters; for this learning which they (no matter
for what motive) wished me to acquire, I might have put to good account
afterwards. For I disobeyed them not because I had chosen a better way,
but from a fondness for play, loving the honour of victory in the
matches, and to have my ears tickled with lying fables, in order that
they might itch the more furiously—the same curiosity beaming more and
more in my eyes for the shows and sports of my elders. Yet those who
give these entertainments are held in such high repute, that almost all
desire the same for their children, whom they are still willing should
be beaten, if so be these same games keep them from the studies by which
they desire them to arrive at being the givers of them. Look down upon
these things, O Lord, with compassion, and deliver us who now call upon
Thee; deliver those also who do not call upon Thee, that they may call
upon Thee, and that Thou mayest deliver them.
