a little of those talents Thou hast bestowed upon me, and on what
follies I wasted them. For a lesson sufficiently disquieting to my soul
was given me, in hope of praise, and fear of shame or stripes, to speak

trifles, a shameful prey of <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) the
fowls of the air. For there is more than one way in which men sacrifice
to the fallen angels.
