<span id="vi.VIII.XII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VIII.XII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Having Prayed to God, He Pours
Forth a Shower of Tears, And, Admonished by a Voice, He Opens the Book
and Reads the Words in Rom. XIII. 13; By Which, Being Changed in His
Whole Soul, He Discloses the Divine Favour to His Friend and His
Mother.</span>

<span id="vi.VIII.XII-p2"></span>28. But when a profound reflection had,
from the secret depths of my soul, drawn together and heaped up all my
misery before the sight of my heart, there arose a mighty storm,
accompanied by as mighty a shower of tears. Which, that I might pour
forth fully, with its natural expressions, I stole away from Alypius;
for it suggested itself to me that solitude was fitter for the business
of weeping. <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676) So I retired to such
a distance that even his presence could not be oppressive to me. Thus
was it with me at that time, and he perceived it; for something, I
believe, I had spoken, wherein the sound of my voice appeared choked
with weeping, and in that state had I risen up. He then remained where
we had been sitting, most completely astonished. I flung myself down,
how, I know not, under a certain fig-tree, giving free course to my
tears, and the streams of mine eyes gushed out, an acceptable sacrifice
unto Thee. <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677) And, not indeed in
these words, yet to this effect, spake I much unto Thee,—“But Thou, O
Lord, how long?” <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678) “How long,
Lord? Wilt Thou be angry for ever? Oh, remember not against us former
iniquities;” <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679) for I felt that I
was enthralled by them. I sent up these sorrowful cries,—“How long, how
long? Tomorrow, and tomorrow? Why not now? Why is there not this hour an
end to my uncleanness?”

<span id="vi.VIII.XII-p7"></span>29. I was saying these things and
weeping in the most bitter contrition of my heart, when, lo, I heard the
voice as of a boy or girl, I know not which, coming from a neighbouring
house, chanting, and oft repeating, “Take up and read; take up and
read.” Immediately my countenance was changed, and I began most
earnestly to consider whether it was usual for children in any kind of
game to sing such words; nor could I remember ever to have heard the
like. So, restraining the torrent of my tears, I rose up, interpreting
it no other way than as a command to me from Heaven to open the book,
and to read the first

<span id="vi.VIII.XII-p8"></span>Chapter I should light upon. For I had
heard of Antony, <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680) that,
accidentally coming in whilst the gospel was being read, he received the
admonition as if what was read were addressed to him, “Go and sell that
thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven;
and come and follow me.” <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681) And by
such oracle was he forthwith converted unto Thee. So quickly I returned
to the place where Alypius was sitting; for there had I put down the
volume of the apostles, when I rose thence. I grasped, opened, and in
silence read that paragraph on which my eyes first fell,—“Not in rioting
and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and
envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for
the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.” <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682) No further would I read, nor did I
need; for instantly, as <span id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span
id="vi.VIII.XII-Page_128"></span>the sentence ended,—by a light, as it
were, of security infused into my heart,—all the gloom of doubt vanished
away.

<span id="vi.VIII.XII-p12"></span>30. Closing the book, then, and
putting either my finger between, or some other mark, I now with a
tranquil countenance made it known to Alypius. And he thus disclosed to
me what was wrought in him, which I knew not. He asked to look at what I
had read. I showed him; and he looked even further than I had read, and
I knew not what followed. This it was, verily, “Him that is weak in the
faith, receive ye;” <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683) which he
applied to himself, and discovered to me. By this admonition was he
strengthened; and by a good resolution and purpose, very much in accord
with his character (wherein, for the better, he was always far different
from me), without any restless delay he joined me. Thence we go in to my
mother. We make it known to her,—she rejoiceth. We relate how it came to
pass,—she leapeth for joy, and triumpheth, and blesseth Thee, who art
“able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think; <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684) for she perceived Thee to have given
her more for me than she used to ask by her pitiful and most doleful
groanings. For Thou didst so convert me unto Thyself, that I sought
neither a wife, nor any other of this world’s hopes,—standing in that
rule of faith <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685) in which Thou, so
many years before, had showed me unto her in a vision. And thou didst
turn her grief into a gladness, <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686)
much more plentiful than she had desired, and much dearer and chaster
than she used to crave, by having grandchildren of my body.
