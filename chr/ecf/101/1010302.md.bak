Evening and Setting, the Image of Eternal Life and Rest in God.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXVI-p2"></span>51. But the seventh day is without
any evening, nor hath it any setting, because Thou hast sanctified it to
an everlasting continuance that that which Thou didst after Thy works,
which were very good, resting on the seventh day, although in unbroken
rest Thou madest them that the voice of Thy Book may speak beforehand
unto us, that we also after our works (therefore very good, because Thou
hast given them unto us) may repose in Thee also in the Sabbath of
eternal life.
