Things.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XIII-p2"></span>20. All these things I retain in my
memory, and how I learnt them I retain. I retain also many things which
I have heard most falsely objected against them, which though they be
false, yet is it not false that I have remembered them; and I remember,
too, that I have distinguished between those truths and these falsehoods
uttered against them; and I now see that it is one thing to distinguish
these things, another to remember that I often distinguished them, when
I often reflected upon them. I both remember, then, that I have often
understood these things, and what I now distinguish and comprehend I
store away in my memory, that hereafter I may remember that I understood
it now. Therefore also I remember that I have remembered; so that if
afterwards I shall call to mind that I have been able to remember these
things, it will be through the power of memory that I shall call it to
mind.
