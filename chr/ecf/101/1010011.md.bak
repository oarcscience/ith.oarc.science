<span id="iv.5-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.5-p2.1"></span>CHAPTER V.—*The Influence of St. Augustin upon
Posterity, and his Relation to Catholicism and Protestantism*.</span>

<span id="iv.5-p3"></span>In conclusion we must add some observations
respecting the influence of Augustin on the Church and the world since
his time, and his position with reference to the great antagonism of
Catholicism and Protestantism. All the church fathers are, indeed, the
common inheritance of both parties; but no other of them has produced so
permanent effects on both, and no other stands in so high regard with
both, as Augustin. Upon the Greek Church alone has he exercised little
or no influence; for this Church stopped with the undeveloped
synergistic anthropology of the previous age, and rejects most
decidedly, as a Latin heresy, the doctrine of the *double* procession of
the Holy Spirit (the *Filioque*) for which Augustin is chiefly
responsible. <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md)

<span id="iv.5-p5"></span>1. Augustin, in the first place, contributed
much to the development of the doctrinal basis which Catholicism and
Protestantism hold *in common* against such radical heresies of
antiquity as Manichæism, Arianism, and Pelagianism. In all these great
intellectual conflicts he was in general the champion of the cause of
Christian truth against dangerous errors. Through his influence the
canon of Holy Scripture (including, indeed, the Old Testament Apocrypha)
was fixed in its present form by the councils of Hippo (393) and
Carthage (397). He conquered the Manichæan dualism, hylozoism, and
fatalism, and saved the biblical idea of God and of creation, and the
biblical doctrine of the nature of sin and its origin in the free will
of man. He developed the Nicene dogma of the Trinity, in opposition to
tritheism on the one hand, and Sabellianism on the other, but also with
the doubtful addition of the *Filioque*, and in opposition to the Greek,
gave it the form in which it has ever since prevailed in the West. In
this form the dogma received classical expression from his school in the
falsely so called Athanasian Creed, which is not recognized by the Greek
Church, and which better deserves the name of the Augustinian Creed.

<span id="iv.5-p6"></span>In Christology, on the contrary, he added
nothing new, and he died shortly before the great Christological
conflicts opened, which reached their œcumenical settlement at the
council of Chalcedon, twenty years after his death. Yet he anticipated
Leo in giving currency in the West to the important formula: “Two
natures in one person.” <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md)

<span id="iv.5-p8"></span>2. Augustin is also the principal theological
creator of the *Latin-Catholic* system as distinct from the Greek
Catholicism on the one hand, and from evangelical protestantism on the
other. He ruled the entire theology of the middle age, and became the
father of scholasticism in virtue of his dialectic mind, and the father
of mysticism in virtue of his devout heart, without being responsible
for the excesses of either system. For scholasticism thought to
comprehend the divine with the understanding, and lost itself at last in
empty dialectics; and mysticism <span id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span
id="iv.5-Page_20"></span>endeavoured to grasp the divine with feeling,
and easily strayed into misty sentimentalism; Augustin sought to
apprehend the divine with the united power of mind and heart, of bold
thought and humble faith. <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) Anselm,
Bernard of Clairvaux, Thomas Aquinas, and Bonaventura, are his nearest
of kin in this respect. Even now, since the Catholic Church has become a
Roman Church, he enjoys greater consideration in it than Ambrose,
Hilary, Jerome, or Gregory the Great. All this cannot possibly be
explained without an interior affinity. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md)

<span id="iv.5-p11"></span>His very conversion, in which, besides the
Scriptures, the personal intercourse of the hierarchical Ambrose and the
life of the ascetic Anthony had great influence, was a transition not
from heathenism to Christianity (for he was already a Manichæan
Christian), but from heresy to the historical, orthodox, episcopally
organized church, as, for the time, the sole authorized vehicle of the
apostolic Christianity in conflict with those sects and parties which
more or less assailed the foundations of the Gospel. It was, indeed, a
full and unconditional surrender of his mind and heart to God, but it
was at the same time a submission of his private judgment to the
authority of the church which led him to the faith of the gospel. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) In the same spirit he embraced the
ascetic life, without which, according to the Catholic principle, no
high religion is possible. He did not indeed enter a cloister, like
Luther, whose conversion in Erfurt was likewise essentially catholic,
but he lived in his house in the simplicity of a monk, and made and kept
the vow of voluntary poverty and celibacy. <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md)

<span id="iv.5-p14"></span>He adopted Cyprian’s doctrine of the church,
and completed it in the conflict with Donatism by transferring the
predicates of unity, holiness, universality, exclusiveness, and
maternity, directly to the actual church of the time, which, with a firm
episcopal organization, an unbroken succession, and the Apostles’ Creed,
triumphantly withstood the eighty or the hundred opposing sects in the
heretical catalogue of the day, and had its visible centre in Rome. In
this church he had found rescue from the shipwreck of his life, the home
of true Christianity, firm ground for his thinking, satisfaction for his
heart, and a commensurate field for the wide range of his powers. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) The predicate of infallibility alone he
does not plainly bring forward; he assumes a progressive correction of
earlier councils by later; and in the Pelagian controversy he asserts
the same independence towards pope Zosimus, which Cyprian before him had
shown towards pope Stephen in the controversy on heretical baptism, with
the advantage of having the right on his side, so that Zosimus found
himself compelled to yield to the African church. But after <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span id="iv.5-Page_21"></span>the
condemnation of the Pelagian errors by the Roman see (418), he declared
that “the case is finished, if only the error were also finished.” <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md)

<span id="iv.5-p17"></span>He was the first to give a clear and fixed
definition of the sacrament, as a visible sign of invisible grace,
resting on divine appointment; but he knows nothing of the number seven;
this was a much later enactment. In the doctrine of baptism he is
entirely Catholic, though in logical contradiction with his dogma of
predestination; he maintained the necessity of baptism for salvation on
the ground of [John ii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.5-p17.1"></span> and [Mark xvi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.5-p17.2"></span>, and
derived from it the horrible dogma of the eternal damnation of all
unbaptized infants, though he reduced their condition to a mere absence
of bliss, without actual suffering. <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md)
In the doctrine of the holy communion he stands, like his predecessors,
Tertullian and Cyprian, nearer to the Calvinistic than any other theory
of a spiritual presence and fruition of Christ’s body and blood. He
certainly can not be quoted in favor of transubstantiation. He was the
chief authority of Ratramnus and Berengar in their opposition to this
dogma.

<span id="iv.5-p19"></span>He contributed to promote, at least in his
later writings, the Catholic faith of miracles, <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) and the worship of Mary; <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) though he exempts the Virgin only from
actual sin, not from original, and, with all his reverence for her,
never calls her “mother of God.” <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md)

<span id="iv.5-p23"></span>At first an advocate of religious liberty and
of purely spiritual methods of opposing error, he afterwards asserted
the fatal principle of forcible coërcion, and lent the great weight of
his authority to the system of civil persecution, at the bloody fruits
of which in the middle age he himself would have shuddered; for he was
always at heart a man of love and gentleness, and personally acted on
the glorious principle: “Nothing conquers but truth, and the victory of
truth is love.” <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md)

<span id="iv.5-p25"></span>Thus even truly great and good men have
unintentionally, through mistaken zeal, become the authors of
incalculable mischief.

<span id="iv.5-p26"></span>3. But, on the other hand, Augustin is, of
all the fathers, nearest to *evangelical Protestantism*, and may be
called, in respect of his doctrine of sin and grace, the first
forerunner of the Reformation. The Lutheran and Reformed churches have
ever conceded to him, without scruple, the cognomen of Saint, and
claimed him as one of the most enlightened witnesses of the truth and
most striking examples of the marvellous power of divine grace in the
transformation of a sinner. It is worthy of mark, that his Pauline
doctrines, which are most nearly <span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span
id="iv.5-Page_22"></span>akin to Protestantism, are the later and more
mature parts of his system, and that just these found great acceptance
with the laity. The Pelagian controversy, in which he developed his
anthropology, marks the culmination of his theological and
ecclesiastical career, and his latest writings were directed against the
Pelagian Julian and the Semi-Pelagians in Gaul, who were brought to his
notice by two friendly laymen, Prosper and Hilary. These anti-Pelagian
works have wrought mightily, it is most true, upon the Catholic church,
and have held in check the Pelagianizing tendencies of the hierarchical
and monastic system, but they have never passed into its blood and
marrow. They waited for a favourable future, and nourished in silence an
opposition to the prevailing system.

<span id="iv.5-p27"></span>In the middle age the better sects, which
attempted to simplify, purify, and spiritualize the reigning
Christianity by return to the Holy Scriptures, and the Reformers before
the Reformation, such as Wiclif, Hus, Wessel, resorted most, after the
apostle Paul, to the bishop of Hippo as the representative of the
doctrine of free grace.

<span id="iv.5-p28"></span>The Reformers were led by his writings into a
deeper understanding of Paul, and so prepared for their great vocation.
No church teacher did so much to mould Luther and Calvin; none furnished
them so powerful weapons against the dominant Pelagianism and formalism;
none is so often quoted by them with esteem and love. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md)

<span id="iv.5-p30"></span>All the Reformers in the outset, Melanchthon
and Zwingle among them, adopted his denial of free will and his doctrine
of predestination, and sometimes even went beyond him into the abyss of
supralapsarianism, to cut out the last roots of human merit and
boasting. In this point Augustin holds the same relation to the Catholic
church, as Luther to the Lutheran; that is, he is a heretic of
unimpeachable authority, who is more admired than censured even in his
extravagances; yet his doctrine of predestination was *indirectly*
condemned by the pope in Jansenism, as Luther’s view was rejected as
Calvinism by the Formula of Concord. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) For Jansenism was nothing but a revival
of Augustinianism in the bosom of the Roman Catholic church. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md)

<span id="iv.5-p33"></span><span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span
id="iv.5-Page_23"></span>The excess of Augustin and the Reformers in
this direction is due to the earnestness and energy of their sense of
sin and grace. The Pelagian looseness could never beget a reformer. It
was only the unshaken conviction of man’s own inability, of
unconditional dependence on God, and of the almighty power of his grace
to give us strength for every good work, which could do this. He who
would give others the conviction that he has a divine vocation for the
church and for mankind, must himself be penetrated with the faith of an
eternal, unalterable decree of God, and must cling to it in the darkest
hours.

<span id="iv.5-p34"></span>In great men, and only in great men, great
opposites and apparently antagonistic truths live together. Small minds
cannot hold them. The catholic, churchly, sacramental, and sacerdotal
system stands in conflict with the evangelical Protestant Christianity
of subjective, personal experience. The doctrine of universal baptismal
regeneration, in particular, which presupposes a universal call (at
least within the church), can on principles of logic hardly be united
with the doctrine of an absolute predestination, which limits the decree
of redemption to a portion of the baptized. Augustin supposes, on the
one hand, that every baptized person, through the inward operation of
the Holy Ghost, which accompanies the outward act of the sacrament,
receives the forgiveness of sins, and is translated from the state of
nature into the state of grace, and thus, *qua baptizatus*, is also a
child of God and an heir of eternal life; and yet, on the other hand, he
makes all these benefits dependent on the absolute will of God, who
saves only a certain number out of the “mass of perdition,” and
preserves these to the end. Regeneration and election, with him, do not,
as with Calvin, coincide. The former may exist without the latter, but
the latter cannot exist without the former. Augustin assumes that many
are actually born into the kingdom of grace only to perish again; Calvin
holds that in the case of the non-elect baptism is an unmeaning
ceremony; the one putting the delusion in the inward effect, the other
in the outward form. The sacramental, churchly system throws the main
stress upon the baptismal regeneration, to the injury of the eternal
election; the Calvinistic or Puritan system sacrifices the virtue of the
sacrament to the election; the Lutheran and high Anglican systems seek a
middle ground, without being able to give a satisfactory theological
solution of the problem. The Anglican Church, however allows the two
opposite views, and sanctions the one in the baptismal service of the
Book of Common Prayer, the other in her Thirty-nine Articles, and other
standards, as interpreted by the low church or evangelical party in a
moderately Calvinistic sense.

<span id="iv.5-p35"></span>It was an evident ordering of God, that
Augustin’s theology, like the Latin Bible of Jerome, appeared just in
the transitional period of history, in which the old civilization was
passing away before the flood of barbarism, and a new order of things,
under the guidance of the Christian religion, was in preparation. The
church, with her strong, imposing organization and her firm system of
doctrine, must save Christianity amidst the chaotic turmoil of the great
migration, and must become a training-school for the barbarian nations
of the middle age. <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md)

<span id="iv.5-p37"></span>In this process of training, next to the Holy
Scriptures, the scholarship of <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p37.1"></span>Jerome</span> and the theology and fertile ideas
of <span class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p37.2"></span>Augustin</span> were
the most important intellectual agents.

<span id="iv.5-p38"></span><span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span
id="iv.5-Page_24"></span>Augustin was held in so universal esteem that
he could exert influence in all directions, and even in his excesses
gave no offence. He was sufficiently catholic for the principle of
church authority, and yet at the same time so free and evangelical that
he modified its hierarchical and sacramental character, reacted against
its tendencies to outward, mechanical ritualism, and kept alive a deep
consciousness of sin and grace, and a spirit of fervent and truly
Christian piety, until that spirit grew strong enough to break the shell
of hierarchical tutelage, and enter a new stage of it development. No
other father could have acted more beneficently on the Catholicism of
the middle age, and more successfully provided for the evangelical
Reformation than St. Augustin, the worthy successor of Paul, and the
precursor of Luther and Calvin.

<span id="iv.5-p39"></span>He had lived at the time of the Reformation,
he would in all probability have taken the lead of the evangelical
movement against the prevailing Pelagianism of the Roman church, though
he would not have gone so far as Luther or Calvin. For we must not
forget that, notwithstanding their strong affinity, there is an
important difference between Catholicism and Romanism or Popery. They
sustain a similar relation to each other as the Judaism of the Old
Testament dispensation, which looked to, and prepared the way for,
Christianity, and the Judaism after the crucifixion and after the
destruction of Jerusalem, which is antagonistic to Christianity.
Catholicism covers the entire ancient and mediæval history of the
church, and includes the Pauline, Augustinian, or evangelical tendencies
which increased with the corruptions of the papacy and the growing sense
of the necessity of a “*reformation in capite et membris*.” Romanism
proper dates from the council of Trent, which gave it symbolical
expression and anathematized the doctrines of the Reformation.
Catholicism is the strength of Romanism, Romanism is the weakness of
Catholicism. Catholicism produced Jansenism, Popery condemned it. Popery
never forgets and never learns anything, and can allow no change in
doctrine (except by way of addition), without sacrificing its
fundamental principle of infallibility, and thus committing suicide. But
Catholicism may ultimately burst the chains of Popery which have so long
kept it confined, and may assume new life and vigour.

<span id="iv.5-p40"></span>Such a personage as Augustin, still holding a
mediating place between the two great divisions of Christendom, revered
alike by both, and of equal influence with both, is furthermore a
welcome pledge of the elevating prospect of a future reconciliation of
Catholicism and Protestantism in a high unity, conserving all the
truths, losing all the errors, forgiving all the sins, forgetting all
the enmities of both. After all, the contradiction between authority and
freedom, the objective and the subjective, the churchly and the
personal, the organic and the individual, the sacramental and the
experimental in religion, is not absolute, but relative and temporary,
and arises not so much from the nature of things, as from the
deficiencies of man’s knowledge and piety in this world. These elements
admit of an ultimate harmony in the perfect state of the church,
corresponding to the union of the divine and human natures, which
transcends the limits of finite thought and logical comprehension, and
is yet completely realized in the person of Christ. They are in fact
united in the theological system of St. Paul, who had the highest view
of the church, as the mystical “body of Christ,” and “the pillar and
ground of the truth,” and who was at the same time the great champion of
evangelical freedom, individual responsibility, and personal union of
the believer with his Saviour. <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p40.1"></span>We believe in and hope for one holy catholic
apostolic church, one communion of saints, one flock, one
Shepherd</span>. The more the different churches become truly Christian,
the nearer they draw to Christ, and the more they labor for His kingdom
which rises above them all, the nearer will they come to one another.
For Christ is the common head and vital centre of all believers, and the
divine harmony of all discordant human sects and creeds. <span
class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p40.2"></span>In Christ</span>, says Pascal,
one of the greatest and noblest disciples of Augustin, <span
class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p40.3"></span>In Christ all contradictions are
solved</span>.

<span id="iv.5-p4"></span> The church fathers of the first six centuries
are certainly far more Catholic than Protestant, and laid the doctrinal
foundation of the orthodox Greek and Roman churches. But it betrays a
contracted, slavish, and mechanical view of history, when Roman Catholic
divines claim the fathers as their exclusive property; forgetting that
they taught many things which are as inconsistent with the papal as with
the Protestant Creed, and that they knew nothing of certain dogmas which
are essential to Romanism (such as the infallibility of the pope, the
seven sacraments, transubstantiation, purgatory, indulgences, auricular
confession, the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, etc.). “I
recollect well,” says Dr. <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p4.1"></span>Newman</span>, the former intellectual leader of
Oxford Tractarianism (in his Letter to Dr. Pusey on his *Eirenicon*,
1866, p. 5), “what an outcast I seemed to myself, when I took down from
the shelves of my library the volumes of St. Athanasius or St. Basil,
and set myself to study them; and how, on the contrary, when at length I
was brought into Catholic communion, I kissed them with delight, with a
feeling that in them I had more than all that I had lost, and, as though
I were directly addressing the glorious saints, who bequeathed them to
the Church, I said to the inanimate pages, ‘You are now mine, and I am
yours, beyond any mistake.’” With the same right the Jews might lay
exclusive claim to the writings of Moses and the prophets. The fathers
were living men, representing the onward progress and conflicts of
Christianity in their time, unfolding and defending great truths, but
not unmixed with many errors and imperfections which subsequent times
have corrected. Those are the true children of the fathers who, standing
on the foundation of Christ and the apostles, and, kissing the New
Testament rather than any human writings, follow them only as far as
they followed Christ, and who carry forward their work in the onward
march of evangelical catholic Christianity.

<span id="iv.5-p7"></span> He was summoned to the council of Ephesus,
which condemned Nestorianism in 431, but died a year before it met. He
prevailed upon the Gallic monk, Leporius, to retract Nestorianism. His
Christology is in many points defective and obscure. Comp. <span
class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p7.1"></span>Dorner’s</span> *History of
Christology*, ii. pp. 88-98 (Germ. ed.). Jerome did still less for this
department of doctrine.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[20:59](1010011.htm#fr_58.md) <span
id="iv.5-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p9"></span> Wigger’s (*Pragmat. Darstellung des
Augustinismus und Pelegianismus*, i. p. 27) finds the most peculiar and
remarkable point of Augustin’s character in his singular union of
intellect and imagination, scholasticism and mysticism, in which neither
can be said to predominate. So also <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p9.1"></span>Huber</span>, *l. c.* p. 313.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[20:60](1010011.htm#fr_59.md) <span
id="iv.5-p9.2"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p10"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p10.1"></span>Nourrisson</span>, the able expounder of the
philosophy of Augustin, says (*l. c.* tom. i. p. iv): “*Je ne crois pas,
qu’excepté saint Paul, aucun homme ait contribué davantage, par sa
parole comme par ses écrits, à organiser, à interpréter, à répandre le
christianisme; et, après saint Paul, nul apparemment, non pas même le
glorieux, l’invincible Athanase, n’a travaillé d’une manière aussi
puissante à fonder l’unité catholique*.”

<span id="fn_60"></span>[20:61](1010011.htm#fr_60.md) <span
id="iv.5-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p12"></span> We recall his famous anti-Manichæan dictum:
“*Ego evangelio non crederem, nisi me catholicæ ecclesiæ commoveret
auctoritas*.” The Protestant would reverse this maxim, and ground his
faith in the church on his faith in Christ and in the gospel. So with
the well-known maxim of Irenæus: “*Ubi ecclesia, ibi Spiritus Dei, et
ubi Spiritus Dei, ibi ecclesia*.” According to the spirit of
Protestantism it would be said conversely: “Where the Spirit of God is,
there is the church, and where the church is, there is the Spirit of
God.”

<span id="fn_61"></span>[20:62](1010011.htm#fr_61.md) <span
id="iv.5-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p13"></span> According to genuine Christian principles it
would have been far more noble, if he had married the African woman with
whom he had lived in illicit intercourse for thirteen years, who was
always faithful to him, as he was to her, and had borne him his beloved
and highly gifted Adeodatus; instead of casting her off, and, as he for
a while intended, choosing another for the partner of his life, whose
excellences were more numerous. The superiority of the evangelical
Protestant morality over the Catholic asceticism is here palpable. But
with the prevailing spirit of his age he would hardly have enjoyed so
great regard, nor accomplished so much good if he had been married.
Celibacy was the bridge from the heathen degradation of marriage to the
evangelical Christian exaltation and sanctification of the family life.

<span id="iv.5-p15"></span> On Augustin’s doctrine of the church, see
*Ch. Hist.* III. §71, and especially the thorough account by <span
class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p15.1"></span>R. Rothe</span>: *Anfänge der
christl. Kirche und ihrer Verfassung*, vol. i. (1837), pp. 679-711.
“Augustin,” says he, “decidely adopted Cyprian’s conception \[of the
church\] in all essential points. And once adopting it, he penetrated it
in its whole depth with his wonderfully powerful and exuberant soul,
and, by means of his own clear, logical mind, gave it the perfect and
rigorous system which perhaps it still lacked” (p. 679 sqq.).
“Augustin’s conception of the doctrine of the church was about standard
for succeeding times” (p. 685). See also an able article of Prof.
Reuter, of Göttingen, on Augustin’s views concerning episcopacy,
tradition, infallibility, in Brieger’s “*Zeitschrift für Hist. Theol*.”
for 1885 (Bk. VIII. pp. 126-187).

<span id="iv.5-p16"></span> Hence the famous word: “*Roma locuta est,
causa finita est*,” which is often quoted as an argument for the modern
Vatican dogma of papal infallibility. But it is not found in this form,
though we may admit that it is an epigrammatic condensation of sentences
of Augustin. The nearest approach to it is in his *Sermo* CXXXI. cap.
10, §10 (Tom. VII. 645): “*Iam enim de hac causa duo concilia missa sunt
ad sedem apostolicam* (Rome), *inde etiam rescripta venerunt. Causa
finita est, utinam aliquando error finiatur*.” Comp. Reuter, *l. c.* p.
157.

<span id="iv.5-p18"></span> Respecting Augustin’s doctrine of baptism,
see the thorough discussion in <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p18.1"></span>W. Wall’s</span> *History of Infant Baptism*,
vol. i. p. 173 sqq. (Oxford ed. of 1862). His view of the slight
condemnation of all unbaptized children contains the germ of the
scholastic fancy of the *limbus infantum* and the *pæna damni*, as
distinct from the lower regions of hell and the *pæna sensus*.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[21:66](1010011.htm#fr_65.md) <span
id="iv.5-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p20"></span> In his former writings he expressed a truly
philosophical view concerning miracles (*De vera relig.* c. 25, §47; c.
50, §98; *De utilit. credendi*, c. 16, §34; *De peccat. meritis et
remiss.* l. ii. c. 32, §52, and *De civit. Dei*, xxii. c. 8); but in his
*Retract.* l. i. c. 14, §5, he corrects or modifies a former remark in
his book *De utilit. credendi*, stating that he did not mean to deny the
continuance of miracles altogether, but only such great miracles as
occurred at the time of Christ (“*quia non tanta nec omnia, non quia
nulla fiunt*”). See *Ch. Hist.* III. §§87 and 88, and the instructive
monograph of the younger <span class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p20.1"></span>
Nitzsch</span>: *Augustinus’ Lehre vom Wunder*, Berlin, 1865 (97 pp.).

<span id="iv.5-p22"></span> Comp. *Tract. in Evang. Joannis*, viii. c.
9, where he says: “*Cur ergo ait matri filius; Quid mihi et tibi est,
mulier? nondum venit hora mea* ([John ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004)<span id="iv.5-p22.1"></span>.md).
*Dominus noster Jesus Christus et Deus erat et homo: secundum quod Deus
erat, matrem non habebat; secundum quod homo erat, habebat. Mater ergo
\[Maria\] erat carnis, mater humanitatis, mater infirmitatis quam
suscepit propter nos*.” This strict separation of the Godhead from the
manhood of Jesus in his birth from the Virgin would have exposed
Augustin in the East to the suspicion of Nestorianism. But he died a
year before the council of Ephesus, at which Nestorius was condemned.

<span id="iv.5-p24"></span> See *Ch. Hist.* III. §27, p. 144 sq. He
changed his view partly from his experience that the Donatists, in his
own diocese, were converted to the catholic unity “*timore legum
imperialium*,” and were afterwards perfectly good Catholics. He adduces
also a misinterpretation of [Luke xiv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.5-p24.1"></span>, and
[Prov. ix. 9](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.5-p24.2"></span>: “*Da sapienti occasionem et sapientior erit*.”
*Ep. 93<span id="iv.5-p24.3"></span>, ad Vincentium Rogatistam*, §17
(tom. ii. p. 237 sq. ed. Bened.). But he expressly discouraged the
infliction of death on heretics, and adjured the proconsul Donatus, Ep.
100<span id="iv.5-p24.4"></span>, by Jesus Christ, not to repay the
Donatists in kind. “*Corrigi eos cupimus, non necari*.”

<span id="fn_69"></span>[22:70](1010011.htm#fr_69.md) <span
id="iv.5-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p29"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p29.1"></span>Luther</span> pronounced upon the church fathers
(with whom, however, excepting Augustin, he was but slightly acquainted)
very condemnatory judgments, even upon Basil, Chrysostom, and Jerome
(for Jerome he had a downright antipathy, on account of his advocacy of
fasts, virginity, and monkery); he was at times dissatisfied even with
Augustin, because he after all did not find in him his *sola fide*, his
*articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiæ*, and says of him: “Augustin
often erred; he cannot be trusted. Though he was good and holy, yet he,
as well as other fathers, was wanting in the true faith.” But this
cursory utterance is overborne by numerous commendations; and all such
judgments of Luther must be taken *cum grano salis*. He calls Augustin
the most pious, grave, and sincere of the fathers, and the patron of
divines, who taught a pure doctrine and submitted it in Christian
humility to the Holy Scriptures, etc., and he thinks, if he had lived in
the sixteenth century, he would have been a Protestant (*si hoc seculo
viveret, nobiscum sentiret*), while Jerome would have gone with Rome.
Compare his singular but striking judgments on the fathers in *Lutheri
Colloquia*, ed. H. E. Bindseil, 1863, tom. iii. 149, and many other
places. <span class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p29.2"></span>Gangauf</span>, a
Roman Catholic (a pupil of the philosopher Günther), concedes (*l. c.*
p. 28, note 13) that Luther and Calvin built their doctrinal system
mainly on Augustin, but, as he correctly thinks, with only partial
right. <span class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p29.3"></span>Nourrisson</span>,
likewise a Roman Catholic, derives Protestantism from a corrupted (!)
Augustinianism, and very superficially makes Lutheranism and Calvinism
essentially to consist in the denial of the freedom of the will, which
was only one of the questions of the Reformation. “*On ne saurait le
méconnaître, de l’Augustinianisme corrompu, mais enfin de
l’Augustinianisme procède le Protestantisme. Car, sans parler de Wiclif
et de Huss, qui, nourris de saint Augustin, soutiennent, avec le
réalisme platonicien, la doctrine de la prédestination: Luther et Calvin
ne font guère autre chose, dans leurs principaux ouvrages, que cultiver
des semences d’Augustinianisme*” (*l. c.* ii. p. 176). But the
Reformation is far more, of course, than a repristination of an old
controversy; it is a new creation, and marks the epoch of modern
Christianity which is different both from the mediæval and from ancient
or patristic Christianity.

id="iv.5-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p31"></span> It is well known that <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p31.1"></span>Luther</span>, as late as 1526, in his work, *De
servo arbitrio*, against Erasmus, which he never retracted, proceeded
upon the most rigorous notion of the divine omnipotence, wholly denied
the freedom of will, declared it a mere lie (*merum mendacium*),
pronounced the calls of the Scriptures to repentance a divine irony, and
based eternal salvation and eternal perdition upon the secret will of
God; in all this he almost exceeded Calvin. See particulars in the books
on doctrine-history; the inaugural dissertation of <span
class="c9"><span id="iv.5-p31.2"></span> Jul. Müller</span>: *Lutheri de
prædestinatione et libero arbitrio doctrina*, Gött. 1832; and a
historical treatise on predestination by <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p31.3"></span>Carl Beck</span> in the “*Studien und Kritiken*”
for 1847. We add, as a curiosity, the opinion of <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p31.4"></span>Gibbon</span> (ch. xxxiii.), who, however, had a
very limited and superficial knowledge of Augustin: “The rigid system of
Christianity which he framed or restored, has been entertained, with
public applause, and secret reluctance, by the Latin church. The church
of Rome has canonized Augustin, and reprobated Calvin. Yet as the real
difference between them is invisible even to a theological microscope,
the Molinists are oppressed by the authority of the saint, and the
Jansenists are disgraced by their resemblance to the heretic. In the
mean while the Protestant Arminians stand aloof, and deride the mutual
perplexity of the disputants. Perhaps a reasoner, still more
independent, may smile in his turn when he peruses an Arminian
commentary on the Epistle to the Romans.” <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p31.5"></span> Nourrisson</span> (ii. 179), from his Roman
stand-point, likewise makes Lutheranism to consist “*essentiellement
dans la question du libre arbitre*.” But the principle of Lutheranism,
and of Protestantism generally, is the supremacy of the Holy Scriptures
as a rule of faith, and salvation by free grace through faith in Christ.

id="iv.5-p31.6"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p32"></span> On the mighty influence of Augustin in the
seventeenth century in France, especially on the noble Jansenists, see
the works on Jansenism, and also <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p32.1"></span>Nourrisson</span>, *l. c.* tom. ii. pp. 186-276.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[23:73](1010011.htm#fr_72.md) <span
id="iv.5-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iv.5-p36"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iv.5-p36.1"></span>Guizot</span>, the Protestant historian and
statesman, very correctly says in his *Histoire générale de la
civilisation en Europe* (Deuxième lecon, p. 45 sq. ed. Bruxelles, 1850):
“*S’il n’eût pas été une église, je ne sais ce qui en serait avenu au
milieu de la chute de l’empire romain.…Si le christianisme n’eût été
comme dans les premiers temps, qu’une croyance, un sentiment, une
conviction individuelle, on peut croire qu’il aurait succombé au milieu
de la dissolution de l’empire et de l’invasion des barbares. Il a
succombé plus tard, en Asie et dans tous le nord de l’Afrique, sous une
invasion de même nature, sous l’invasion des barbares musulmans; il a
succombé alors, quoiqu’il fût à l’êtat d’institution, d’église
constituée. A bien plus forte raison le même fait aurait pu arriver au
moment de la chute de l’empire romain. Il n’y avait alors aucun des
moyens par lesquels aujourd’hui les influences morales s’établissent ou
résistent indépendamment des institutions, aucun des moyens par lesquels
une pure vérité, une pure idée acquiert un grand empire sur les esprits,
gouverne les actions, dêtermine des événemens. Rien de semblable
n’existait au IVe siècle, pour donner aux idées, aux sentiments
personels, une pareille autorité. Il est clair qu’il fallait une société
fortement organisée, fortement gouvernée, pour lutter contre un pareil
désastre, pour sortir victorieuse d’un tel ouragan. Je ne crois pas trop
dire en affirmant qu’à la fin du IVe et au commencement du Ve siècle,
c’est l’église chrétienne qui a sauvé le christianisme; c’est l’église
avec ses institutions, ses magistrats, son pouvoir, qui s’est défendue
vigoureusement contre la dissolution intérieure de l’empire, contre la
barbarie, qui a conquis les barbares, qui est devenue le lien, le moyen,
le principe dé civilisation entre le monde romain et le monde barbare*.”
