All Things, But Neither Heaven Nor Earth Containeth Him.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.III-p3"></span>3. Since, then, Thou fillest heaven and
earth, do they contain Thee? Or, as they contain Thee not, dost Thou
fill them, and yet there remains something over? And where dost Thou
pour forth that which remaineth of Thee when the heaven and earth are
filled? Or, indeed, is there no need that Thou who containest all things
shouldest be contained of any, since those things which Thou fillest
Thou fillest by containing them? For the vessels which Thou fillest do
not sustain Thee, since should they even be broken Thou wilt not be
poured forth. And when Thou art poured forth on us, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) Thou art not cast down, but we are
uplifted; nor art Thou dissipated, but we are drawn together. But, as
Thou fillest all things, dost Thou fill them with Thy whole self, or, as
even all things cannot altogether contain Thee, do they contain a part,
and do all at once contain the same part? Or has each its own proper
part—the greater more, the smaller less? Is, then, one part of Thee
greater, another less? Or is it that Thou art wholly everywhere whilst
nothing altogether contains Thee? <span
