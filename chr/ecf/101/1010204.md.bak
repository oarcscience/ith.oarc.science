id="vi.XI.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—He Begins from the Creation of
the World—Not Understanding the Hebrew Text.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.III-p2"></span>5. Let me hear and understand how in the
beginning Thou didst make the heaven and the earth. <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) Moses wrote this; he wrote and
departed,—passed hence from Thee to Thee. Nor now is he before me; for
if he were I would hold him, and ask him, and would adjure him by Thee
that he would open unto me these things, and I would lend the ears of my
body to the sounds bursting forth from his mouth. And should he speak in
the Hebrew tongue, in vain would it beat on my senses, nor would aught
touch my mind; but if in Latin, I should know what he said. But whence
should I know whether he said what was true? But if I knew this even,
should I know it from him? Verily within me, within in the chamber of my
thought, <span id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span
id="vi.XI.III-Page_165"></span>Truth, neither Hebrew, <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) nor Greek, nor Latin, nor
barbarian, without the organs of voice and tongue, without the sound of
syllables, would say, “He speaks the truth,” and I, forthwith assured of
it, confidently would say unto that man of Thine, “Thou speakest the
truth.” As, then, I cannot inquire of him, I beseech Thee,—Thee, O
Truth, full of whom he spake truth,—Thee, my God, I beseech, forgive my
sins; and do Thou, who didst give to that Thy servant to speak these
things, grant to me also to understand them.

<span id="vi.XI.III-p4"></span> Augustin was not singular amongst the
early Fathers in not knowing Hebrew, for of the Greeks only Origen, and
of the Latins Jerome, knew anything of it. We find him confessing his
ignorance both here and elsewhere (*Enarr. in Ps.* cxxxvi. 7, and *De
Doctr.* *Christ*. ii. 22); and though he recommends a knowledge of
Hebrew as well as Greek, to correct “the endless diversity of the Latin
translators” (*De Doctr. Christ.* ii. 16); he speaks as strongly as does
Grinfield, in his *Apology for the Septuagint*, in favour of the claims
of that version to “biblical and canonical authority” (*Eps.* xxviii.,
lxxi., and lxxv.; *De Civ.* *Dei*, xviii. 42, 43; *De Doctr. Christ.*
ii. 22). He discountenanced Jerome’s new translation, probably from fear
of giving offence, and, as we gather from *Ep.* lxxi. 5, not without
cause. From the tumult he there describes as ensuing upon Jerome’s
version being read, the outcry would appear to have been as great as
when, on the change of the old style of reckoning to the new, the
ignorant mob clamoured to have back their eleven days!
