<span id="vii.1.III-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.III-p1.1"></span>Letter III.</span>

<span id="vii.1.III-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.III-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 387.)

<span id="vii.1.III-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.III-p3.1"></span>To Nebridius Augustin Sends
Greeting.</span>* <span id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md)

<span id="vii.1.III-p5"></span>1. Whether I am to regard it as the
effect of what I may call your flattering language, or whether the thing
be really so, is a point which I am unable to decide. For the impression
was sudden, and I am not yet resolved how far it deserves to be
believed. You wonder what this can be. What do you think? You have
almost made me believe, not indeed that I am happy—for that is the
heritage of the wise alone—but that I am at least in a sense happy: as
we apply the designation *man* to beings who deserve the name only in a
sense if compared with Plato’s ideal man, or speak of things which we
see as *round* or *square*, although they differ widely from the perfect
figure which is discerned by the mind of a few. I read your letter
beside my lamp after supper: immediately after which I lay down, but not
at once to sleep; for on my bed I meditated long, and talked thus with
myself—Augustin addressing and answering Augustin: “Is it not true, as
Nebridius affirms, that I am happy?” “Absolutely true it cannot be, for
that I am still far from wise he himself would not deny.” “But may not a
happy life be the lot even of those who are not wise?” “That is scarcely
possible; because, in that case, lack of wisdom would be a small
misfortune, and not, as it actually is, the one and only source of
unhappiness.” “How, then, did Nebridius come to esteem me happy? Was it
that, after reading these little books of mine, he ventured to pronounce
me wise? Surely the vehemence of joy could not make him so rash,
especially seeing that he is a man to whose judgment I well know so much
weight is to be attached. I have it now: he wrote what he thought would
be most gratifying to me, because he had been gratified by what I had
written in those treatises; and he wrote in a joyful mood, without
accurately weighing the sentiments entrusted to his joyous pen. What,
then, would he have said if he had read my *Soliloquies*? He would have
rejoiced with much more exultation, and yet could find no loftier name
to bestow on me than this which he has already given in calling me
happy. All at once, then, he has lavished on me the highest <span
id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="vii.1.III-Page_221"></span>possible name, and has not reserved a
single word to add to my praises, if at any time he were made by me more
joyful than he is now. See what joy does.”

<span id="vii.1.III-p6"></span>2. But where is that truly happy life?
where? ay, where? Oh! if it were attained, one would spurn the atomic
theory of Epicurus. Oh! if it were attained, one would know that there
is nothing here below but the visible world. Oh! if it were attained,
one would know that in the rotation of a globe on its axis, the motion
of points near the poles is less rapid than of those which lie half way
between them,—and other such like things which we likewise know. But
now, how or in what sense can I be called happy, who know not why the
world is such in size as it is, when the proportions of the figures
according to which it is framed do in no way hinder its being enlarged
to any extent desired? Or how might it not be said to me—nay, might we
not be compelled to admit that matter is infinitely divisible; so that,
starting from any given base (so to speak), a definite number of
corpuscles must rise to a definite and ascertainable quantity?
Wherefore, seeing that we do not admit that any particle is so small as
to be insusceptible of further diminution, what compels us to admit that
any assemblage of parts is so great that it cannot possibly be
increased? Is there perchance some important truth in what I once
suggested confidentially to Alypius, that since number, as cognisable by
the understanding, is susceptible of infinite augmentation, but not of
infinite diminution, <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) because
we cannot reduce it lower than to the units, number, as cognisable by
the senses (and this, of course, just means quantity of material parts
or bodies), is on the contrary susceptible of infinite diminution, but
has a limit to its augmentation? This may perhaps be the reason why
philosophers justly pronounce riches to be found in the things about
which the understanding is exercised, and poverty in those things with
which the senses have to do. For what is poorer than to be susceptible
of endless diminution? and what more truly rich than to increase as much
as you will, to go whither you will, to return when you will and as far
as you will, and to have as the object of your love that which is large
and cannot be made less? For whoever understands these numbers loves
nothing so much as the unit; and no wonder, seeing that it is through it
that all the other numbers can be loved by him. But to return: Why is
the world the size that it is, seeing that it might have been greater or
less? I do not know: its dimensions are what they are, and I can go no
further. Again: Why is the world in the place it now occupies rather
than in another? Here, too, it is better not to put the question; for
whatever the answer might be, other questions would still remain. This
one thing greatly perplexed me, that bodies could be infinitely
subdivided. To this perhaps an answer has been given, by setting over
against it the converse property of abstract number \[viz. its
susceptibility of infinite multiplication\].

<span id="vii.1.III-p8"></span>3. But stay: let us see what is that
indefinable object <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) which is
suggested to the mind. This world with which our senses acquaint us is
surely the image of some world which the understanding apprehends. Now
it is a strange phenomenon which we observe in the images which mirrors
reflect to us,—that however great the mirrors be, they do not make the
images larger than the objects placed before them, be they ever so
small; but in small mirrors, such as the pupil of the eye, although a
large surface be placed over against them, a very small image is formed,
proportioned to the size of the mirror. <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) Therefore if the mirrors be reduced
in size, the images reflected in them are also reduced; but it is not
possible for the images to be enlarged by enlarging the mirrors. Surely
there is in this something which might reward further investigation; but
meanwhile, I must sleep. <span id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md)
Moreover, if I seem to Nebridius to be happy, it is not because I seek,
but because perchance I have found something. What, then, is that
something? Is it that chain of reasoning which I am wont so to caress as
if it were my sole treasure, and in which perhaps I take too much
delight?

<span id="vii.1.III-p12"></span>4. “Of what parts do we consist?” “Of
soul and body.” “Which of these is the nobler?” “Doubtless the soul.”
“What do men praise in the body?” “Nothing that I see but comeliness.”
“And what is comeliness of body?” “Harmony of parts in the form,
together with a certain agreeableness of colour.” “Is this comeliness
better where it is true or where it is illusive?” “Unquestionably it is
better where it is true.” “And where is it found true? In the soul.”
“The soul, therefore, is to be loved more than the body; but in what
part of the soul does this truth reside?” “In the mind and
understanding.” “With what has the understanding to contend?” “With the
senses.” “Must we then resist the senses with all our might?”
“Certainly.” “What, then, if the things with which the senses acquaint
us give us pleasure?” “We must prevent them from doing so.” “How?” <span
id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span id="vii.1.III-Page_222"></span>“By
acquiring the habit of doing without them, and desiring better things.”
“But if the soul die, what then?” “Why, then truth dies, or intelligence
is not truth, or intelligence is not a part of the soul, or that which
has some part immortal is liable to die: conclusions all of which I
demonstrated long ago in my *Soliloquies* to be absurd because
impossible; and I am firmly persuaded that this is the case, but somehow
through the influence of custom in the experience of evils we are
terrified, and hesitate. But even granting, finally, that the soul dies,
which I do not see to be in any way possible, it remains nevertheless
true that a happy life does not consist in the evanescent joy which
sensible objects can yield: this I have pondered deliberately, and
proved.”

<span id="vii.1.III-p13"></span>Perhaps it is on account of reasonings
such as these that I have been judged by my own Nebridius to be, if not
absolutely happy, at least in a sense happy. Let me also judge myself to
be happy: for what do I lose thereby, or why should I grudge to think
well of my own estate? Thus I talked with myself, then prayed according
to my custom, and fell asleep.

<span id="vii.1.III-p14"></span>5. These things I have thought good to
write to you. For it gratifies me that you should thank me when I write
freely to you whatever crosses my mind; and to whom can I more willingly
write nonsense <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) than to one
whom I cannot displease? But if it depends upon fortune whether one man
love another or not, look to it, I pray you, how can I be justly called
happy when I am so elated with joy by fortune’s favours, and avowedly
desire that my store of such good things may be largely increased? For
those who are most truly wise, and whom alone it is right to pronounce
happy, have maintained that fortune’s favours ought not to be the
objects of either fear or desire.

<span id="vii.1.III-p16"></span>Now here I used the word “*cupi*:” <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) will you tell me whether it should
be “*cupi*” or “*cupiri*?” And I am glad this has come in the way, for I
wish you to instruct me in the inflexion of this verb “*cupio*,” since,
when I compare similar verbs with it, my uncertainty as to the proper
inflexion increases. For “*cupio*” is like “*fugio*,” “*sapio*,”
“*jacio*,” “*capio*;” but whether the infinitive mood is “*fugiri*” or
“*fugi*,” “*sapiri*” or “*sapi*,” I do not know. I might regard “*jaci*”
and “*capi*” <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) as parallel
instances answering my question as to the others, were I not afraid lest
some grammarian should “catch” and “throw” me like a ball in sport
wherever he pleased, by reminding me that the form of the supines
“*jactum*” and “*captum*” is different from that found in the other
verbs “*fugitum*,” “*cupitum*” and “*sapitum*.” As to these three words,
moreover, I am likewise ignorant whether the penultimate is to be
pronounced long and with circumflex accent, or without accent and short.
I would like to provoke you to write a reasonably long letter. I beg you
to let me have what it will take some time to read. For it is far beyond
my power to express the pleasure which I find in reading what you write.

id="vii.1.III-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vii.1.III-p4"></span> The character of Nebridius, and the
intimacy of friendship between him and Augustin, may be seen in the
Confessions, b. ix. c. 3.

<span id="fn_1444"></span>[221:1445](1010310.htm#fr_1444.md) <span
id="vii.1.III-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vii.1.III-p7"></span> Had Augustin been acquainted with the
decimal notation, he would not have made this remark to Alypius; for in
the decimal scale, when the point is inserted, fractional parts go on
diminishing according to the number of cyphers between them and the
point (*e.g* .001), precisely as the integers increase according to the
number of cyphers between them and the decimal point (*e.g.*
100.),—there being no limit to the descending series on the right hand
of the decimal point, any more than to the ascending series on the left
hand of the same point.

<span id="fn_1445"></span>[221:1446](1010310.htm#fr_1445.md) <span

<span id="vii.1.III-p10"></span> Augustin’s acquaintance with the first
principles of optics, and with the properties of reflection possessed by
convex, plane, and concave mirrors, was very limited.

<span id="fn_1447"></span>[221:1448](1010310.htm#fr_1447.md) <span

respectively to “throw” and to “catch.”
