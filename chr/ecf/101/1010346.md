<span id="vii.1.XXXIX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XXXIX-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 397.)

<span id="vii.1.XXXIX-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIX-p3.1"></span>To My Lord Augustin, a Father</span>* <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) *<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIX-p4.1"></span>Truly Holy and Most Blessed, Jerome Sends
Greeting in Christ.</span>*

<span id="vii.1.XXXIX-p5"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIX-p5.1"></span>Chap. I.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XXXIX-p6"></span>1. Last year I sent by the hand of our
brother, the subdeacon Asterius, a letter conveying to your Excellency a
salutation due to you, and readily rendered by me; and I think that my
letter was delivered to you. I now write again, by my holy brother the
deacon Præsidius, begging you in the first place not to forget me, and
in the second place to receive the bearer of this letter, whom I commend
to you with the request that you recognise him as one very near and dear
to me, and that you encourage and help him in whatever way his
circumstances may demand; not that he is in need of anything (for Christ
has amply endowed him), but that he is most eagerly desiring the
friendship of good men, and thinks that in securing this he obtains the
most valuable blessing. His design in travelling to the West you may
learn from his own lips.

<span id="vii.1.XXXIX-p7"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIX-p7.1"></span>Chap. II.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XXXIX-p8"></span>2. As for us, established here in our
monastery, we feel the shock of waves on every side, and are burdened
with the cares of our lot as pilgrims. But we believe in Him who hath
said, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world,” <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) and are confident that by His grace
and guidance we shall prevail against our adversary the devil.

<span id="vii.1.XXXIX-p10"></span>I beseech you to give my respectful
salutation to the holy and venerable brother, our father Alypius. The
brethren who, with me, devote themselves to serve the Lord in this
monastery, salute you warmly. May Christ our Almighty God guard you from
harm, and keep you mindful of me, my lord and father truly holy and
venerable.
