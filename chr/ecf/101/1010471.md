<span id="vii.1.CCXLV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCXLV-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXLV.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXLV-p2"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXLV-p2.1"></span>To Possidius,</span>* <span
id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010.md) *<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXLV-p3.1"></span>My Most Beloved Lord and Venerable Brother
and Partner in the Sacerdotal Office, and to the Brethren Who are with
Him, Augustin and the Brethren Who are with Him Send Greeting in the
Lord.</span>*

<span id="vii.1.CCXLV-p4"></span>1. It requires more consideration to
decide what to do with those who refuse to obey you, than to discover
how to show them that things which they do are unlawful. Meanwhile,
however, the letter of your Holiness has come upon me when I am
exceedingly pressed with business, and the very hasty departure of the
bearer has made it necessary for me to write you in reply, but has not
given me time to answer as I ought to have done in regard to the matters
on which you have consulted me. Let me say, <span id="page_588">p.
588</span> <span id="vii.1.CCXLV-Page_588"></span>however, in regard to
ornaments of gold and costly dress, that I would not have you come to a
precipitate decision in the way of forbidding their use, except in the
case of those who, neither being married nor intending to marry, are
bound to consider only how they may please God. But those who belong to
the world have also to consider how they may in these things please
their wives if they be husbands, their husbands if they be wives; <span
id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011.md) with this limitation, that it is
not becoming even in married women to uncover their hair, since the
apostle commands women to keep their heads covered. <span
id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012.md) As to the use of pigments by women
in colouring the face, in order to have a ruddier or a fairer
complexion, this is a dishonest artifice, by which I am sure that even
their own husbands do not wish to be deceived; and it is only for their
own husbands that women ought to be permitted to adorn themselves,
according to the toleration, not the injunction, of Scripture. For the
true adorning, especially of Christian men and women, consists not only
in the absence of all deceitful painting of the complexion, but in the
possession not of magnificent golden ornaments or rich apparel, but of a
blameless life.

<span id="vii.1.CCXLV-p7"></span>2. As for the accursed superstition of
wearing amulets (among which the earrings worn by men at the top of the
ear on one side are to be reckoned), it is practised with the view not
of pleasing men, but of doing homage to devils. But who can expect to
find in Scripture express prohibition of every form of wicked
superstition, seeing that the apostle says generally, “I would not that
ye should have fellowship with devils,” <span
id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013.md) and again, “What concord hath
Christ with Belial?” <span id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md) unless,
perchance, the fact that he named Belial, while he forbade in general
terms fellowship with devils, leaves it open for Christians to sacrifice
to Neptune, because we nowhere read an express prohibition of the
worship of Neptune! Meanwhile, let those unhappy people be admonished
that, if they persist in disobedience to salutary precepts, they must at
least forbear from defending their impieties, and thereby involving
themselves in greater guilt. But why should we argue at all with them if
they are afraid to take off their earrings, and are not afraid to
receive the body of Christ while wearing the badge of the devil?

<span id="vii.1.CCXLV-p10"></span>As to ordaining a man who was baptized
in the Donatist sect, I cannot take the responsibility of recommending
you to do this; it is one thing for you to do it if you are left without
alternative, it is another thing for me to advise that you should do it.

spoken of in Letter CI. sec. 1, p. 412 was the Bishop of Calama who made
the narrow escape recorded in Letter XCI. sec. 8, p. 379. He was for
forty years an intimate friend of Augustin, was with him at his death,
and wrote his biography.
