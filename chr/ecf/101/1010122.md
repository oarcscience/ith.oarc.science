Of God’s Creation, He Conceives of Two Original Substances.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XIV-p2"></span>20. There is no wholeness in them whom
aught of Thy creation displeased no more than there was in me, when many
things which Thou madest displeased me. And, because my soul dared not
be displeased at my God, it would not suffer aught to be Thine which
displeased it. Hence it had gone into the opinion of two substances, and
resisted not, but talked foolishly. And, returning thence, it had made
to itself a god, through infinite measures of all space; and imagined it
to be Thee, and placed it in its heart, and again had become the temple
of its own idol, which was to Thee an abomination. But after Thou hadst
fomented the head of me unconscious of it, and closed mine eyes lest
they should “behold vanity,” <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540) I
ceased from myself a little, and my madness was lulled to sleep; and I
awoke in Thee, and saw Thee to be infinite, though in another way; and
this sight was not derived from the flesh.
