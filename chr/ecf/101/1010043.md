id="vi.II_1.VIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—In His Theft He Loved the
Company of His Fellow-Sinners.</span>

<span id="vi.II_1.VIII-p2"></span>16. “What fruit had I then,” <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) wretched one, in those things which,
when I remember them, cause me shame—above all in that theft, which I
loved only for the theft’s sake? And as the theft itself was nothing,
all the more wretched was I who loved it. Yet by myself alone I would
not have done it—I recall what my heart was—alone I could not have done
it. I loved, then, in it the companionship of my accomplices with whom I
did it. I did not, therefore, love the theft alone—yea, rather, it was
that alone that I loved, for the companionship was nothing. What is the
fact? Who is it that can teach me, but He who illuminateth mine heart
and searcheth out the dark corners thereof? What is it that hath come
into my mind to inquire about, to discuss, and to reflect upon? For had
I at that time loved the pears I stole, and wished to enjoy them, I
might have done so alone, if I could have been satisfied with the mere
commission of the theft by which my pleasure was secured; nor needed I
have provoked that itching of my own passions, by the encouragement of
accomplices. But as my enjoyment was not in those pears, it was in the
crime itself, which the company of my fellow-sinners produced.
