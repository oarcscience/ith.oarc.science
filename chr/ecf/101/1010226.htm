<p class="c10"><a name="vi.XI.XXV-p2"></A>32. And I confess unto Thee, O Lord, that I am as yet ignorant as to what time is, and again I confess unto Thee, O Lord, that I know that I speak these things in time, and that I have already long spoken of time, and that very &#8220;long&#8221; is not long save by the stay of time. How, then, know I this, when I know not what time is? Or is it, perchance, that I know not in what wise I may express what I know? Alas for me, that I do not at least know the extent of my own ignorance! Behold, O my God, before Thee I lie not. As I speak, so is my heart. Thou shalt light my candle; Thou, O Lord my God, wilt enlighten my darkness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1050"></A><A HREF="#fn_1050"><FONT SIZE="1">1051</FONT></A>
