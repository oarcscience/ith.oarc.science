id="vi.XII.XXIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Two Kinds of Disagreements
in the Books to Be Explained.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XXIII-p2"></span>32. These things, therefore, being
heard and perceived according to my weakness of apprehension, which I
confess unto Thee, O Lord, who knowest it, I see that two sorts of
differences may arise when by signs anything is related, even by true
reporters,—one concerning the truth of the things, the other concerning
the meaning of him who reports them. For in one way we inquire,
concerning the forming of the creature, what is true; but in another,
what Moses, that excellent servant of Thy faith, would have wished that
the reader and hearer should understand by these words. As for the first
kind, let all those depart from me who imagine themselves to know as
true what is false. And as for the other also, let all depart from me
who imagine Moses to have spoken things that are false. But let me be
united in Thee, O Lord, with them, and in Thee delight myself with them
that feed on Thy truth, in the breadth of charity; and let us approach
together unto the words of Thy book, and in them make search for Thy
will, through the will of Thy servant by whose pen Thou hast dispensed
them.
