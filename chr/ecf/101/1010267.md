id="vi.XIII.I-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—He Calls Upon God, and Proposes to
Himself to Worship Him.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.I-p2"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.XIII.I-p2.1"></span>I Call</span> upon Thee, my God, my mercy,
who madest me, and who didst not forget me, though forgetful of Thee. I
call Thee into <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167.md) my soul, which
by the desire which Thou inspirest in it Thou preparest for Thy
reception. Do not Thou forsake me calling upon Thee, who didst
anticipate me before I called, and didst importunately urge with
manifold calls that I should hear Thee from afar, and be converted, and
call upon Thee who calledst me. For Thou, O Lord, hast blotted out all
my evil deserts, that Thou mightest not repay into my hands wherewith I
have fallen from Thee, and Thou hast anticipated all my good deserts,
that Thou mightest repay into Thy hands wherewith Thou madest me;
because before I was, Thou wast, nor was I \[anything\] to which Thou
mightest grant being. And yet behold, I am, out of Thy goodness,
anticipating all this which Thou hast made me, and of which Thou hast
made me. For neither hadst Thou stood in need of me, nor am I such a
good as to be helpful unto Thee, <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168.md) my Lord and God; not that I may so
serve Thee as though Thou wert fatigued in working, or lest Thy power
may be less if lacking my assistance nor that, like the land, I may so
cultivate Thee that Thou wouldest be uncultivated did I cultivate Thee
not but that I may serve and worship Thee, to the end that I may have
well-being from Thee; from whom it is that I am one susceptible of
well-being.
