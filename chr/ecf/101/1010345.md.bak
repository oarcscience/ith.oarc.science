<span id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 397.)

<span id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p3.1"></span>To His Brother Profuturus Augustin Sends
Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p4"></span>1. As for my spirit, I am well,
through the Lord’s good pleasure, and the strength which He condescends
to impart; but as for my body, I am confined to bed. I can neither walk,
nor stand, nor sit, because of the pain and swelling of a boil or
tumour. <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) But even in such a
case, since this is the will of the Lord, what else can I say than that
I am well? For if we do not wish that which He is pleased to do, we
ought rather to take blame to ourselves than to think that He could err
in anything which He either does or suffers to be done. All this you
know well; but what shall I more willingly say to you than the things
which I say to myself, seeing that you are to me a second self? I
commend therefore both my days and my nights to your pious
intercessions. Pray for me, that I may not waste my days through want of
self-control, and that I may bear my nights with patience: pray that,
though I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, the Lord may so be
with me that I shall fear no evil.

<span id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p6"></span>2. You have heard, doubtless, of the
death of the aged Megalius, <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md)
for it is now twenty-four days since he put off this mortal body. I wish
to know, if possible, whether you have seen, as you proposed, his
successor in the primacy. We are not delivered from offences, but it is
equally true that we are not deprived of our refuge; our griefs do not
cease, but our consolations are equally abiding. And well do you know,
my excellent brother, how, in the midst of such offences, we must watch
lest hatred of any one gain a hold upon the heart, and so not only
hinder us from praying to God with the door of our chamber closed, <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) but also shut the door against God
Himself; for hatred of another insidiously creeps upon us, while no one
who is angry considers his anger to be unjust. For anger habitually
cherished against any one becomes hatred, since the sweetness which is
mingled with what appears to be righteous anger makes us detain it
longer than we ought in the vessel, until the whole is soured, and the
vessel itself is spoiled. Wherefore it is much better for us to forbear
from anger, even when one has given us just occasion for it, than,
beginning with what seems just anger against any one, to fall, through
this occult tendency of passion, into hating him. We are wont to say
that, in entertaining strangers, it is much better to bear the
inconvenience of receiving a bad man than to run the risk of having a
good man shut out, through our caution lest any bad man be admitted; but
in the passions of the soul the opposite rule holds true. For it is
incomparably more for our soul’s welfare to shut the recesses of the
heart against anger, even when it knocks with a just claim for
admission, than to admit that which it will be most difficult to expel,
and which will rapidly grow from a mere sapling to a strong tree. Anger
dares to increase with <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="vii.1.XXXVIII-Page_272"></span>boldness more suddenly than men
suppose, for it does not blush in the dark, when the sun has gone down
upon it. <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) You will understand
with how great care and anxiety I write these things, if you consider
the things which lately on a certain journey you said to me.

<span id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p10"></span>3. I salute my brother Severus, and
those who are with him. I would perhaps write to them also, if the
limited time before the departure of the bearer permitted me. I beseech
you also to assist me in persuading our brother Victor (to whom I desire
through your Holiness to express my thanks for his informing me of his
setting out to Constantina) not to refuse to return by way of Calama, on
account of a business known to him, in which I have to bear a very heavy
burden in the importunate urgency of the elder Nectarius concerning it;
he gave me his promise to this effect. Farewell!

<span id="vii.1.XXXVIII-p7"></span> Megalius, Bishop of Calama and
Primate of Numidia, by whom two years before Augustin had been ordained
Bishop of Hippo. The reflections upon anger which follow the allusion
here to the death of Megalius were probably suggested by the remembrance
of an incident in the life of that bishop. While Augustin was a
presbyter, Megalius had written in anger a letter to him for which he
afterwards apologized, formally retracting calumny which it contained.
