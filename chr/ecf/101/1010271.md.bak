id="vi.XIII.V-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—He Recognises the Trinity in the
First Two Verses of Genesis.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.V-p2"></span>6. Behold now, the Trinity appears unto
me in an enigma, which Thou, O my God, art, since Thou, O Father, in the
Beginning of our wisdom,—Which is Thy Wisdom, born of Thyself, equal and
co-eternal unto Thee,—that is, in Thy Son, hast created heaven and
earth. Many things have we said of the heaven of heavens, and of the
earth invisible and formless, and of the darksome deep, in reference to
the wandering defects of its spiritual deformity, were it not converted
unto Him from whom was its life, such as it was, and by His enlightening
became a beauteous life, and the heaven of that heaven which was
afterwards set between water and water. And under the name of God, I now
held the Father, who made these things; and under the name of the
Beginning, <span id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md) the Son, in whom
He made these things; and believing, as I did, that my God was the
Trinity, I sought further in His holy words, and behold, Thy Spirit was
borne over the waters. Behold the Trinity, O my God, Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost,—the Creator of all creation.
