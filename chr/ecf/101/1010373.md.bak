<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXVII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 402.)

<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXVII-p3.1"></span>To My Lord Most Beloved and Longed For, My
Honoured Brother in Christ, and Fellow-Presbyter, Jerome, Augustin Sends
Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXVII-p4.1"></span>Chap. I.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p5"></span>1. I have heard that my letter has come
to your hand. I have not yet received a reply, but I do not on this
account question your affection; doubtless something has hitherto
prevented you. Wherefore I know and avow that my prayer should be, that
God would put it in your power to forward your reply, for He has already
given you power to prepare it, seeing that you can do so with the utmost
ease if you feel disposed.

<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXVII-p6.1"></span>Chap. II.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p7"></span>2. I have hesitated whether to give
credence or not to a certain report which has reached me; but I felt
that I ought not to hesitate as to writing a few lines to you regarding
the matter. To be brief, I have heard that some brethren have told your
Charity that I have written a book against you and have sent it to Rome.
Be assured that this is false: I call God to witness that I have not
done this. But if perchance there be some things in some of my writings
in which I am found to have been of a different opinion from you, I
think you ought to know, or if it cannot be certainly known, at least to
believe, that such things have been written not with a view of
contradicting you, but only of stating my own views. In saying this,
however, let me assure you that not only am I most ready to hear in a
brotherly spirit the objections which you may entertain to anything in
my writings which has displeased you, but I entreat, nay implore you, to
acquaint me with them; and thus I shall be made glad either by the
correction of my mistake, or at least by the expression of your
goodwill.

<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p8"></span>3. Oh that it were in my power, by our
living near each other, if not under the same roof, to enjoy frequent
and sweet conference with you in the Lord! Since, however, this is not
granted, I beg you to take pains that this one way in which we can be
together in the Lord be kept up; nay more, improved and perfected. Do
not refuse to write me in return, however seldom.

<span id="vii.1.LXVII-p9"></span>Greet with my respects our holy brother
Paulinianus, and all the brethren who with you, and because of you,
rejoice in the Lord. May you, remembering us, be heard by the Lord in
regard to all your holy desires, my lord most beloved and longed for, my
honoured brother in Christ.
