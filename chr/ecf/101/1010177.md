<span id="vi.X.XX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—We Should Not Seek for God and the
Happy Life Unless We Had Known It.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XX-p2"></span>29. How, then, do I seek Thee, O Lord? For
when I seek Thee, my God, I seek a happy life. <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) I will seek Thee, that my soul may
live. <span id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md) For my body liveth by my
soul, and my soul liveth by Thee. How, then, do I seek a happy life,
seeing that it is not mine till I can say, “It is enough!” in that place
where I ought to say it? How do I seek it? Is it by remembrance, as
though I had forgotten it, knowing too that I had forgotten it? or,
longing to learn it as a thing unknown, which either I had never known,
or had so forgotten it as not even to remember that I had forgotten it?
Is not a happy life the thing that all desire, and is there any one who
altogether desires it not? But where did they acquire the knowledge of
it, that they so desire it? Where have they seen it, that they so love
it? Truly we have it, but how I know not. Yea, there is another way in
which, when any one hath it, he is happy; and some there be that are
happy in hope. These have it in an inferior kind to those that are happy
in fact; and yet are they better off than they who are happy neither in
fact nor in hope. And even these, had they it not in some way, would not
so much desire to be happy, which that they do desire is most certain.
How they come to know it, I cannot tell, but they have it by some kind
of knowledge unknown to me, who am in much doubt as to whether it be in
the memory; for if it be there, then have we been happy once; whether
all individually, or as in that man who first sinned, in whom also we
all died, <span id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) and from whom we are
all born with misery, I do not now ask; but I ask whether the happy life
be in the memory? For did we not know it, we should not love it. We hear
the name, and we all acknowledge that we desire the thing; for we are
not delighted with the sound only. For when a Greek hears it spoken in
Latin, he does not feel delighted, for he knows not what is spoken; but
we are delighted, <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) as he too
would be if he heard it in Greek; because the thing itself is neither
Greek nor Latin, which Greeks and Latins, and men of all other tongues,
long so earnestly to obtain. It is then known unto all, and could they
with one voice be asked whether they wished to be happy, without doubt
they would all answer that they would. And this could not be unless the
thing itself, of which it is the name, were retained in their memory.
