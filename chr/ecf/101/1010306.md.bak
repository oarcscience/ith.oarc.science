<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="vii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.i-p3.1"></span>The</span> importance of the letters of eminent
men, as illustrations of their life, character, and times, is too well
understood to need remark. The Letters of Cicero and Pliny have given us
a more vivid conception of Roman life than the most careful history
could have given; the Letters of Erasmus, Luther, and Calvin furnish us
with the most trustworthy material for understanding the rapid movement
and fierce conflict of their age; when we read the voluminous
correspondence of Pope and his compeers, or the unstudied beauties of
Cowper’s letters of friendship, we seem to be in the company of living
men; and modern history has in nothing more distinctly proved its
sagacity, than by its diligence in publishing the Letters of Cromwell,
of Washington, of Chatham, and of other historical personages.

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span>For biography, familiar letters are the most
important material. In a man’s published writings we see the general
character of his mind, and we ascertain his opinions in so far as he
deemed it safe or advisable to lay these before a perhaps unsympathizing
public; in his letters he reveals his whole character, his feelings as
well as his judgments, his motives, his personal history, and the
various ramifications of his interest. In his familiar correspondence we
see the man as he is known to his intimate friends, in his times of
relaxation and unstudied utterance. <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) Few men, in writing for the public,
can resist the tendency towards a constrained attitudinizing, or throw
off the fixed expression of one sitting for his portrait; and it is only
in conversation, spoken or written, that we get the whole man revealed
in a series of constantly varying and unconstrained expressions. And
even where, as in Augustin’s case, we have an autobiography, we derive
from the letters many additional traits of character, much valuable
illustration of opinions and progress. <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md)

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span>In their function of appendices to history
they are equally valuable. It was a characteristic remark of Horace
Walpole’s, that “nothing gives so just an idea of an age as genuine
letters; nay, history waits for its last seal from them.” A still
greater authority, Bacon, in his marvellous distribution of all
knowledge, gives to letters the highest place among the “Appendices to
History.” “Letters,” he says, “are, according to all the variety of
occasions, advertisements, advices, directions, propositions, petitions
commendatory, expostulatory, satisfactory; of compliment, of pleasure,
of discourse, and all other passages of action. And such as are written
from wise men are, of all the words of man, in my judgment, the best;
for they are more natural than orations and public speeches, and more
advised than conferences or present speeches. So, again, letters of
affairs from such as manage them, or are privy to them, are of all
others the best instructions for history, and to a diligent reader the
best histories in themselves.” <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) This is especially true of the
Letters of Augustin. A large number of them are ecclesiastical and
theological, and would in our day have appeared as pamphlets, or would
have been delivered as lectures. There are none of his writings which do
not receive some supplementary light from his letters. The subjects of
his more elaborate writings are here handled in an easier manner, and
their sources, <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span
id="vii.i-Page_212"></span>motives, and origin are disclosed.
Difficulties which his published works had occasioned are here removed,
new illustrations are noted, further developments and fresh
complications of heresy are alluded to, and the whole theological
movement of the time is here reflected in a vivid and interesting shape.
No controversy of his age was settled without his voice, and it is in
his letters we chiefly see the vastness of his empire, the variety of
subjects on which appeal was made to him, and the deference with which
his judgment was received. Inquiring philosophers, puzzled statesmen,
angry heretics, pious ladies, all found their way to the Bishop of
Hippo. And while he continually complains of want of leisure, of the
multifarious business of his episcopate, of the unwarranted demands made
upon him, he yet carefully answers all. Sometimes he writes with the
courier who is to carry his letter impatiently chafing outside the door;
sometimes a promptly written reply is carried round the whole known
world by some faithless messenger before it reaches his anxious
correspondent; but, amidst difficulties unthought of under a postal
system, his indefatigable diligence succeeds in diffusing intelligence
and counsel to the most distant inquirers.

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>In the present volume we have, as usual,
followed the Benedictine edition. Among the many labours which the
Benedictine Fathers encountered in editing the works of Augustin, they
undertook the onerous task of rearranging the Epistles in chronological
order. The manner in which this task has been executed is eminently
characteristic of their unostentatious patience and skill. Their order
has been universally adopted; it is to this order that reference is made
when any writer cites a letter of Augustin’s; and therefore it matters
less whether in each case the date assigned by the Benedictine editors
can be accepted as accurate. It will be seen that we have not considered
it desirable to translate all the letters. Of those addressed to
Augustin we have omitted a few which were neither important in
themselves nor indispensable for the understanding of his replies; and,
when any of his own letters is a mere repetition of what he has
previously written to another correspondent, we have contented
ourselves, and, we hope, shall satisfy our readers, with a reference to
the former letter in which the arguments and illustrations now repeated
may be found.

<span id="vii.i-p10"></span>No English translation of these Letters has
previously appeared. The French have in this, as in other patristic
studies, been before us. Two hundred years ago a translation into the
French tongue was published, and this has lately been superseded by M.
Poujoulat’s four readable and fairly accurate volumes.

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span>In the second volume of Letters in Clark’s
series the editor adds the following

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.i-p14.1"></span>Prefatory Note.</span>

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.i-p15.1"></span>Of</span> the two hundred and seventy-two
letters given in the Benedictine edition of Augustin’s works, one
hundred and sixty are translated in this selection. In the former volume
few were omitted, and the reason for each omission was given in its own
place. As the proportion of untranslated letters is in this volume much
larger, it may be more convenient to indicate briefly here the general
reasons which have guided us in the selection.

<span id="vii.i-p16"></span>We have omitted—

<span id="vii.i-p17"></span>I. Almost all the letters referring to the
Donatist schism, as there is enough on this subject in the works on the
Donatist controversy (vol. iii. of this series) and in numerous earlier
letters. This excludes—105, 106, 107, 108, 128, 129, 134, 141, 142, and
204.

<span id="vii.i-p18"></span>II. Almost all the letters relating to
Pelagianism, as the series contains three volumes of Augustin’s
anti-Pelagian writings (vols. iv. xii. xv.). This excludes—156, 157,
175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 181, 182, 183, 184, 184 *bis*, 186, 193, 194,
214, 215, 216, 217.

<span id="vii.i-p19"></span><span id="page_213">p. 213</span> <span
id="vii.i-Page_213"></span>III. Almost all the letters referring to the
doctrine of the Trinity, as this has been already given, partly in
earlier letters, and more fully in the volume on the Trinity (vol. vii.
of this series). This excludes—119, 120, 170, 174, 238, 239, 240, 241,
242.

<span id="vii.i-p20"></span>IV. Almost all those which in design, style,
and prolixity, are exegetical or doctrinal treatises rather than
letters. This excludes—140, 147, 149, 152, 153, 154, 155, 162, 187, 190,
196, 197, 198, 199, 202 *bis*, 205.

<span id="vii.i-p21"></span>V. Some of the letters written by others to
Augustin. This excludes—94, 109, 121, 160, 168, 225, 226, 230, 270.

<span id="vii.i-p22"></span>VI. A large number of miscellaneous smaller
letters, as, in order to avoid going beyond the limits of one volume, it
was necessary to select only the more interesting and important of
these. This excludes—110, 112, 113, 114, 127, 161, 162, 171, 200, 206,
207, 221, 222, 223, 224, 233, 234, 235, 236, 243, 244, 247, 248, 249,
251, 252, 253, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 264, 265, 266,
267, 268.
