<span id="vii.1.LXXIX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LXXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXIX-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXIX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 404.)

<span id="vii.1.LXXIX-p3"></span>A short and stern challenge to some
Manichæan teacher who had succeeded Fortunatus (supposed to be Felix).

<span id="vii.1.LXXIX-p4"></span>Your attempts at evasion are to no
purpose: your real character is patent even a long way off. My brethren
have reported to me their conversation with you. You say that you do not
fear death; it is well: but you ought to fear that death which you are
bringing upon yourself by your blasphemous assertions concerning God. As
to your understanding that the visible death which all men know is a
separation between soul and body, this is a truth which demands no great
grasp of intellect. But as to the statement which you annex to this,
that death is a separation between good and evil, do you not see that,
if the soul be good and the body be evil, he who joined them
together, <span id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) is not good? But
you affirm that the good God has joined them together; from which it
follows that He is either evil, or swayed by fear of one who is evil.
Yet you boast of your having no fear of man, when at the same time you
conceive God to be such that, through fear of Darkness, He would join
together good and evil. Be not uplifted, as your writing shows you to
be, by supposing that I magnify you, by my resolving to check the
out-flowing of your poison, lest its insidious and pestilential power
should do harm: for the apostle does not magnify those whom he calls
“dogs,” saying to the Philippians, “Beware of dogs;” <span
id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) nor does he magnify those of whom
he says that their word doth eat as a canker. <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md) Therefore, in the name of Christ, I
demand of you to answer, if you are able, the question which baffled
your predecessor Fortunatus. <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md)
For he went from the scene of our discussion declaring that he would not
return, unless, after conferring with his party, he found something by
which he could answer the arguments used by our brethren. And if you are
not prepared to do this, begone from this place, and do not pervert the
right ways of the Lord, ensnaring and infecting with your poison the
minds of the weak, lest, by the Lord’s right hand helping me, you be put
to confusion in a way which you did not expect.
