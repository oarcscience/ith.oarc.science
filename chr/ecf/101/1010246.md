id="vi.XII.XIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Of the Intellectual Heaven
and Formless Earth, Out of Which, on Another Day, the Firmament Was
Formed.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XIII-p2"></span>16. Meanwhile I conceive this, O my
God, when I hear Thy Scripture speak, saying, In the beginning God made
heaven and earth; <span id="page_180">p. 180</span> <span
id="vi.XII.XIII-Page_180"></span>but the earth was invisible and without
form, and darkness was upon the deep, and not stating on what day Thou
didst create these things. Thus, meanwhile, do I conceive, that it is on
account of that heaven of heavens, that intellectual heaven, where to
understand is to know all at once,—not “in part,” not “darkly,” not
“through a glass,” <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101) but as a
whole, in manifestation, “face to face;” not this thing now, that anon,
but (as has been said) to know at once without any change of times; and
on account of the invisible and formless earth, without any change of
times; which change is wont to have “this thing now, that anon,”
because, where there is no form there can be no distinction between
“this” or “that;”—it is, then, on account of these two,—a primitively
formed, and a wholly formless; the one heaven, but the heaven of
heavens, the other earth, but the earth invisible and formless;—on
account of these two do I meanwhile conceive that Thy Scripture said
without mention of days, “In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth.” For immediately it added of what earth it spake. And when on
the second day the firmament is recorded to have been created, and
called heaven, it suggests to us of which heaven He spake before without
mention of days.
