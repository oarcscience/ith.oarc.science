<span id="vii.1.XLVIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.XLVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XLVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XLVIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XLVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 398.)

<span id="vii.1.XLVIII-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XLVIII-p3.1"></span>To My Lord Eudoxius, My Brother and
Fellow-Presbyter, Beloved and Longed For, and to the Brethren Who are
with Him,</span>* <span id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) *<span
class="c9"><span id="vii.1.XLVIII-p4.1"></span>Augustin and the Brethren
Who are Here Send Greeting.</span>*

<span id="vii.1.XLVIII-p5"></span>1. When we reflect upon the
undisturbed rest which you enjoy in Christ, we also, although engaged in
labours manifold and arduous, find rest with you, beloved. We are one
body under one Head, so that you share our toils, and we share your
repose: for “if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or if
one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.” <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) Therefore we earnestly exhort and
beseech you, by the deep humility and most compassionate majesty of
Christ, to be mindful of us in your holy intercessions; for we believe
you to be more lively and undistracted in prayer than we can be, whose
prayers are often marred and weakened by the darkness and confusion
arising from secular occupations: not that we have these on our own
account, but we can scarcely breathe for the pressure of such duties
imposed upon us by men compelling us, so to speak, to go with them one
mile, with whom we are commanded by our Lord to go farther than they
ask. <span id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680.md) We believe,
nevertheless, that He before whom the sighing of the prisoner
comes <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) will look on us
persevering in the ministry in which He was pleased to put us, with
promise of reward, and, by the assistance of your prayers, will set us
free from all distress.

<span id="vii.1.XLVIII-p9"></span>2. We exhort you in the Lord,
brethren, to be stedfast in your purpose, and persevere to the end; and
if the Church, your Mother, calls you to active service, guard against
accepting it, on the one hand, with too eager elation of spirit, or
declining it, on the other, under the solicitations of indolence; and
obey God with a lowly heart, submitting yourselves in meekness to Him
who governs you, who will guide the meek in judgment, and will teach
them His way. <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682.md) Do not prefer
your own ease to the claims of the Church; for if no good men were
willing to minister to her in her bringing forth of her spiritual
children, the beginning of your own spiritual life would have been
impossible. As men must keep the way carefully in walking between fire
and water, so as to be neither burned nor drowned, so must we order our
steps between the pinnacle of pride and the whirlpool of indolence; as
it is written, “declining neither to the right hand nor to the
left.” <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683.md) For some, while
guarding too anxiously against being lifted up and raised, as it were,
to the dangerous heights on the right hand, have <span id="page_295">p.
295</span> <span id="vii.1.XLVIII-Page_295"></span>fallen and been
engulphed in the depths on the left. Again, others, while turning too
eagerly from the danger on the left hand of being immersed in the torpid
effeminacy of inaction, are, on the other hand, so destroyed and
consumed by the extravagance of self-conceit, that they vanish into
ashes and smoke. See then, beloved, that in your love of ease you
restrain yourselves from all mere earthly delight, and remember that
there is no place where the fowler who fears lest we fly back to God may
not lay snares for us; let us account him whose captives we once were to
be the sworn enemy of all good men; let us never consider ourselves in
possession of perfect peace until iniquity shall have ceased, and
“judgment shall have returned unto righteousness.” <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md)

<span id="vii.1.XLVIII-p13"></span>3. Moreover, when you are exerting
yourselves with energy and fervour, whatever you do, whether labouring
diligently in prayer, fasting, or almsgiving, or distributing to the
poor, or forgiving injuries, “as God also for Christ’s sake hath
forgiven us,” <span id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md) or subduing
evil habits, and chastening the body and bringing it into
subjection, <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md) or bearing
tribulation, and especially bearing with one another in love (for what
can he bear who is not patient with his brother?), or guarding against
the craft and wiles of the tempter, and by the shield of faith averting
and extinguishing his fiery darts, <span
id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md) or “singing and making melody to
the Lord in your hearts,” or with voices in harmony with your
hearts; <span id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688.md) —whatever you do, I
say, “do all to the glory of God,” <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689.md) who “worketh all in all,” <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690.md) and be so “fervent in Spirit” <span
id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691.md) that your “soul may make her boast
in the Lord.” <span id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md) Such is the
course of those who walk in the “straight way,” whose “eyes are ever
upon the Lord, for He shall pluck their feet out of the net.” <span
id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md) Such a course is neither
interrupted by business, nor benumbed by leisure, neither boisterous nor
languid, neither presumptuous nor desponding, neither reckless nor
supine. “These things do, and the God of peace shall be with you.” <span
id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694.md)

<span id="vii.1.XLVIII-p24"></span>4. Let your charity prevent you from
accounting me forward in wishing to address you by letter. I remind you
of these things, not because I think you come short in them, but because
I thought that I would be much commended unto God by you, if, in doing
your duty to Him, you do it with a remembrance of my exhortation. For
good report, even before the coming of the brethren Eustasius and
Andreas from you, had brought to us, as they did, the good savour of
Christ, which is yielded by your holy conversation. Of these, Eustasius
has gone before us to that land of rest, on the shore of which beat no
rude waves such as those which encompass your island home, and in which
he does not regret Caprera, for the homely raiment <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md) with which it furnished him he
wears no more.
