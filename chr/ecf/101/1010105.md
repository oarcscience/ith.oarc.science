id="vi.VI.XIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The Design of Establishing a
Common Household with His Friends is Speedily Hindered.</span>

<span id="vi.VI.XIV-p2"></span>24. And many of us friends, consulting on
and abhorring the turbulent vexations of human life, had considered and
now almost determined upon living at ease and separate from the turmoil
of men. And this was to be obtained in this way; we were to bring
whatever we could severally procure, and make a common household, so
that, through the sincerity of our friendship, nothing should belong
more to one than the other; but the whole, being derived from all,
should as a whole belong to each, and the whole unto all. It seemed to
us that this <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span
id="vi.VI.XIV-Page_100"></span>society might consist of ten persons,
some of whom were very rich, especially Romanianus, <span
id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) our townsman, an intimate friend of
mine from his childhood, whom grave business matters had then brought up
to Court; who was the most earnest of us all for this project, and whose
voice was of great weight in commending it, because his estate was far
more ample than that of the rest. We had arranged, too, that two
officers should be chosen yearly, for the providing of all necessary
things, whilst the rest were left undisturbed. But when we began to
reflect whether the wives which some of us had already, and others hoped
to have, would permit this, all that plan, which was being so well
framed, broke to pieces in our hands, and was utterly wrecked and cast
aside. Thence we fell again to sighs and groans, and our steps to follow
the broad and beaten ways <span id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) of the
world; for many thoughts were in our heart, but Thy counsel standeth for
ever. <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) Out of which counsel Thou
didst mock ours, and preparedst Thine own, purposing to give us meat in
due season, and to open Thy hand, and to fill our souls with
blessing. <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md)

<span id="vi.VI.XIV-p3"></span> Romanianus was a relation of Alypius
(Aug. *Ep.* 27, *ad Paulin.*), of talent which astonished Augustin
himself (*C. Acad.* i. 1, ii. 1), “surrounded by affluence from early
youth, and snatched by what are thought adverse circumstances from the
absorbing whirlpools of life” (*ibid.*). Augustin frequently mentions
his great wealth, as also this vexatious suit, whereby he was harassed
(*C. Acad.* i. 1, ii. 1), and which so clouded his mind that his talents
were almost unknown (*C. Acad.* ii. 2); as also his very great kindness
to himself, when, “as a poor lad, setting out to foreign study, he had
received him in his house, supported and (yet more) encouraged him; when
deprived of his father, comforted, animated, aided him: when returning
to Carthage, in pursuit of a higher employment, supplied him with all
necessaries.” “Lastly,” says Augustin, “whatever ease I now enjoy, that
I have escaped the bonds of useless desires, that, laying aside the
weight of dead cares, I breathe, recover, return to myself, that with
all earnestness I am seeking the truth \[Augustin wrote this the year
before his baptism\], that I am attaining it, that I trust wholly to
arrive at it, you encouraged, impelled, effected” (*C. Acad.* ii. 2).
Augustin had “cast him headlong with himself” (as so many other of his
friends) into the Manichæan heresy (*ibid.* i. sec. 3), and it is to be
hoped that he extricated him with himself; but we only learn positively
that he continued to be fond of the works of Augustin (*Ep.* 27),
whereas in that which he dedicated to him (*C. Acad.*), Augustin writes
very doubtingly to him, and afterwards recommends him to Paulinus, “to
be cured wholly or in part by his conversation” (*Ep.* 27).—E. B. P.
