<span id="vi.VII.XIX"></span>

<span id="vi.VII.XIX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VII.XIX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—He Does Not Yet Fully
Understand the Saying of John, that “The Word Was Made Flesh.”</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XIX-p2"></span>25. But I thought differently, thinking
only of my Lord Christ as of a man of excellent wisdom, to whom no man
could be equalled; especially for that, being wonderfully born of a
virgin, He seemed, through the divine care for us, to have attained so
great authority of leadership,—for an example of contemning temporal
things for the obtaining of immortality. But what mystery there was in,
“The Word was <span id="page_113">p. 113</span> <span
id="vi.VII.XIX-Page_113"></span>made flesh,” <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) I could not even imagine. Only I had
learnt out of what is delivered to us in writing of Him, that He did
eat, drink, sleep, walk, rejoice in spirit, was sad, and discoursed;
that flesh alone did not cleave unto Thy Word, but with the human soul
and body. All know thus who know the unchangeableness of Thy Word, which
I now knew as well as I could, nor did I at all have any doubt about it.
For, now to move the limbs of the body at will, now not; now to be
stirred by some affection, now not; now by signs to enunciate wise
sayings, now to keep silence, are properties of a soul and mind subject
to change. And should these things be falsely written of Him, all the
rest would risk the imputation, nor would there remain in those books
any saving faith for the human race. Since, then, they were written
truthfully, I acknowledged a perfect man to be in Christ—not the body of
a man only, nor with the body a sensitive soul without a rational, but a
very man; whom, not only as being a form of truth, but for a certain
great excellency of human nature and a more perfect participation of
wisdom, I decided was to be preferred before others. But Alypius
imagined the Catholics to believe that God was so clothed with flesh,
that, besides God and flesh, there was no soul in Christ, and did not
think that a human mind was ascribed to Him. And, because He was
thoroughly persuaded that the actions which were recorded of Him could
not be performed except by a vital and rational creature, he moved the
more slowly towards the Christian faith. But, learning afterwards that
this was the error of the Apollinarian heretics, <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) he rejoiced in the Catholic faith, and
was conformed to it. But somewhat later it was, I confess, that I
learned how in the sentence, “The Word was made flesh,” the Catholic
truth can be distinguished from the falsehood of Photinus. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) For the disapproval of heretics makes
the tenets of Thy Church and sound doctrine to stand out boldly. <span
id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) For there must be also heresies, that
the approved may be made manifest among the weak. <span

id="vi.VII.XIX-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.VII.XIX-p3"></span> We have already seen, in note 1, sec.
13, above, how this text (1) runs counter to Platonic beliefs as to the
<span class="c75"><span id="vi.VII.XIX-p3.1"></span>Logos</span>. The
following passage from Augustin’s *De Civ. Dei*, x. 29, is worth putting
on record in this connection:—“Are ye ashamed to be corrected? This is
the vice of the proud. It is forsooth, a degradation for learned men to
pass from the school of Plato to the discipleship of Christ, who by His
Spirit taught a fisherman to think and to say, ‘In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in
the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was
not any thing made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the
light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
comprehended it not’ ([John 1.1-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.VII.XIX-p3.2"></span>). The old saint Simplicianus, afterwards
Bishop of Milan, used to tell me that a certain Platonist was in the
habit of saying that this opening passage of the holy Gospel entitled,
‘According to John,’ should be written in letters of gold, and hung up
in all churches in the most conspicuous place. But the proud scorn to
take God for their Master, because ‘the Word was made flesh and dwelt
among us’ ([John 1.14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.VII.XIX-p3.3"></span>). So that with these miserable creatures it
is not enough that they are sick, but they boast of their sickness, and
are ashamed of the medicine which could heal them. And doing so, they
secure not elevation, but a more disastrous fall.” This text, too, as
Irenæus has remarked, (2) entirely opposes the false teaching of the
*Docetæ*, who, as their name imports, believed, with the Manichæans,
that Christ only *appeared* to have a body; as was the case, they said,
with the angels entertained by Abraham (see Burton’s *Bampton Lectures*,
lect. 6). It is curious to note here that Augustin maintained that the
Angel of the Covenant was not an anticipation, as it were, of the
incarnation of the Word, but only a created angel (*De Civ. Dei*, xvi.
29, and *De Trin.* iii. 11), thus unconsciously playing into the hands
of the Arians. See Bull’s *Def. Fid. Nic.* i. 1, sec. 2, etc., and iv.
3, sec. 14.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[113:558](1010127.htm#fr_557.md) <span
id="vi.VII.XIX-p3.4"></span>

<span id="vi.VII.XIX-p4"></span> The founder of this heresy was
Apollinaris the younger, Bishop of Laodicea, whose erroneous doctrine
was condemned at the Council of Constantinople, <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.VII.XIX-p4.1"></span>A.D.</span> 381. Note 4, sec. 23, above, on
the “trichotomy,” affords help in understanding it. Apollinaris seems to
have desired to exalt the Saviour, not to detract from His honour, like
Arius. Before his time men had written much on the divine and much on
the human side of our Lord’s nature. He endeavoured to show (see
Dorner’s *Person of Christ*, A. ii. 252, etc., Clark) in what the two
natures united differed from human nature. He concluded that our Lord
had no need of the human <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.VII.XIX-p4.2"></span> πνεῦμα</span>, and that its place was
supplied by the divine nature, so that God “the Word,” the body and the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.VII.XIX-p4.3"></span>ψυχή</span>,
constituted the being of the Saviour. Dr. Pusey quotes the following
passages hereon:—“The faithful who believes and confesses in the
Mediator a real human, *i.e.* our nature, although God the Word, taking
it in a singular manner, sublimated it into the only Son of God, so that
He who took it, and what He took, was one person in the Trinity. For,
after man was assumed, there became not a quaternity but remained the
Trinity, that assumption making in an ineffable way the truth of one
person in God and man. Since we do not say that Christ is only God, as
do the Manichæan heretics, nor only man, as the Photinian heretics, nor
in such wise man as not to have anything which certainly belongs to
human nature, whether the soul, or in the soul itself the rational mind,
or the flesh not taken of the woman, but made of the Word, converted and
changed into flesh, which three false and vain statements made three
several divisions of the Apollinarian heretics; but we say that Christ
is true God, born of God the Father, without any beginning of time, and
also true man, born of a human mother in the fulness of time; and that
His humanity, whereby He is inferior to the Father, does not derogate
from His divinity, whereby He is equal to the Father” (*De Dono Persev.*
sec. *ult.*). “There was formerly a heresy—its remnants perhaps still
exist—of some called Apollinarians. Some of them said that that man whom
the Word took, when ‘the Word was made flesh,’ had not the human, *i.e.*
rational (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.VII.XIX-p4.4"></span>λογικόν</span>) mind, but was only a soul
without human intelligence, but that the very Word of God was in that
man instead of a mind. They were cast out,—the Catholic faith rejected
them, and they made a heresy. It was established in the Catholic faith
that that man whom the wisdom of God took had nothing less than other
men, with regard to the integrity of man’s nature, but as to the
excellency of His person, had more than other men. For other men may be
said to be partakers of the Word of God, having the Word of God, but
none of them can be called the Word of God, which He was called when it
is said, ‘*The Word was made flesh*’ ” (*in Ps.* xxix., *Enarr.* ii.
sec. 2). “But when they reflected that, if their doctrine were true,
they must confess that the only-begotten Son of God, the Wisdom and Word
of the Father, *by whom all things were made*, is believed to have taken
a sort of brute with the figure of a human body, they were dissastisfied
with themselves; yet not so as to amend, and confess that the whole man
was assumed by the wisdom of God, without any diminution of nature, but
still more boldly denied to Him the soul itself, and everything of any
worth in man, and said that He only took human flesh” (*De* 83*, Div.
Quæst*. qu. 80). Reference on the questions touched on in this note may
be made to Neander’s *Church History*, ii. 401, etc. (Clark); and
Hagenbach, *History of Doctrines*, i. 270 (Clark).

id="vi.VII.XIX-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.VII.XIX-p6"></span> Archbishop Trench’s words on this
sentence in the *Confessions* (*Hulsean Lectures*, lect. v. 1845) have a
special interest in the present attitude of the Roman Church:—“Doubtless
there is a true idea of scriptural developments which has always been
recognised, to which the great Fathers of the Church have set their
seal; this, namely, that the Church, informed and quickened by the
Spirit of God, more and more discovers what in Holy Scripture is given
her; but not this, that she unfolds by an independent power anything
further therefrom. She has always possessed what she now possesses of
doctrine and truth, only not always with the same distinctness of
consciousness. She has not added to her wealth, but she has become more
and more aware of that wealth; her dowry has remained always the same,
but that dowry was so rich and so rare, that only little by little she
has counted over and taken stock and inventory of her jewels. She has
consolidated her doctrine, compelled to this by the challenges and
provocation of enemies, or induced to it by the growing sense of her own
needs.” Perhaps no one, to turn from the Church to individual men, has
been more indebted than was Augustin to controversies with heretics for
the evolvement of truth.
