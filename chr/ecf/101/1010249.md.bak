<span id="vi.XII.XVI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XVI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—He Wishes to Have No
Intercourse with Those Who Deny Divine Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XVI-p2"></span>23. With such as grant that all these
things which Thy truth indicates to my mind are true, I desire to confer
a little before Thee, O my God. For let those who deny these things bark
and drown their own voices with their clamour as much as they please; I
will endeavour to persuade them to be quiet, and to suffer Thy word to
reach them. But should they be unwilling, and should they repel me, I
beseech, O my God, that Thou “be not silent to me.” <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) Do Thou speak truly in my heart,
for Thou only so speakest, and I will send them away blowing upon the
dust from without, and raising it up into their own eyes; and will
myself enter into my chamber, <span id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md)
and sing there unto Thee songs of love,—groaning with groaning
unutterable <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) in my pilgrimage,
and remembering Jerusalem, with heart raised up towards it, <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) <span id="page_182">p. 182</span>
<span id="vi.XII.XVI-Page_182"></span>Jerusalem my country, Jerusalem my
mother, and Thyself, the Ruler over it, the Enlightener, the Father, the
Guardian, the Husband, the chaste and strong delight, the solid joy, and
all good things ineffable, even all at the same time, because the one
supreme and true Good. And I will not be turned away until Thou collect
all that I am, from this dispersion <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) and deformity, into the peace of
that very dear mother, where are the first-fruits of my spirit, <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md) whence these things are assured to
me, and Thou conform and confirm it for ever, my God, my Mercy. But with
reference to those who say not that all these things which are true and
false, who honour Thy Holy Scripture set forth by holy Moses, placing
it, as with us, on the summit of an authority <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) to be followed, and yet who
contradict us in some particulars, I thus speak: Be Thou, O our God,
judge between my confessions and their contradictions.

<span id="vi.XII.XVI-p6"></span> Baxter has a noteworthy passage on our
heavenly citizenship in his *Saints’ Rest*: “As Moses, before he died,
went up into Mount Nebo, to take a survey of the land of Canaan, so the
Christian ascends the Mount of Contemplation, and by faith surveys his
rest.…As Daniel in his captivity daily opened his window towards
Jerusalem, though far out of sight, when he went to God in his
devotions, so may the believing soul, in this captivity of the flesh,
look towards ‘Jerusalem which is above’ ([Gal.
4.26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.XII.XVI-p6.1"></span>). And as Paul was to the Colossians ([Col.
2.5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005)<span id="vi.XII.XVI-p6.2"></span>.md)
so may the believer be with the glorified spirits, ‘though absent in the
flesh,’ yet with them ‘in the spirit,’ joying and beholding their
heavenly ‘order.’ And as the lark sweetly sings while she soars on high,
but is suddenly silenced when she falls to the earth, so is the frame of
the soul most delightful and divine while it keeps in the views of God
by contemplation. Alas, we make there too short a stay, fall down again,
and lay by our music!” (Fawcett’s Ed. p. 327).
