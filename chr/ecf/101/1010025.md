id="vi.I_1.IX-p2.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Concerning the Hatred of
Learning, the Love of Play, and the Fear of Being Whipped Noticeable in
Boys: and of the Folly of Our Elders and Masters.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.IX-p3"></span>14. O my God! what miseries and mockeries
did I then experience, when obedience to my teachers was set before me
as proper to my boyhood, that I might flourish in this world, and
distinguish myself in the science of speech, which should get me honour
amongst men, and deceitful riches! After that I was put to school to get
learning, of which I (worthless as I was) knew not what use there was;
and yet, if slow to learn, I was flogged! For this was deemed
praiseworthy by our forefathers; and many before us, passing the same
course, had appointed beforehand for us these troublesome ways by which
we were compelled to pass, multiplying labour and sorrow upon the sons
of Adam. But we found, O Lord, men praying to Thee, and we learned from
them to conceive of Thee, according to our ability, to be some Great
One, who was able (though not visible to our senses) to hear and help
us. For as a boy I began to pray to Thee, my “help” and my
“refuge,” <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) and in invoking Thee
broke the bands of my tongue, and entreated Thee though little, with no
little earnestness, that I might not be beaten at school. And when Thou
heardedst me not, giving me not over to folly thereby, <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) my elders, yea, and my own parents
too, who wished me no ill, laughed at my stripes, my then great and
grievous ill.

<span id="vi.I_1.IX-p6"></span>15. Is there any one, Lord, with so high
a spirit, cleaving to Thee with so strong an affection—for even a kind
of obtuseness may do that much—but is there, I say, any one who, by
cleaving devoutly to Thee, is endowed with so great a courage that he
can esteem lightly those racks and hooks, and varied tortures of the
same sort, against which, throughout the whole world, men supplicate
Thee with great fear, deriding those who most bitterly fear them, just
as our parents derided the torments with which our masters punished us
when we were boys? For we were no less afraid of our pains, nor did we
pray less to Thee to avoid them; and yet we sinned, in writing, or
reading, or reflecting upon our lessons less than was required of us.
For we wanted not, O Lord, memory or capacity, of which, by Thy will, we
possessed enough for our age,—but we delighted only in play; and we were
punished for this by those who were doing the same things themselves.
But the idleness of our elders they call business, whilst boys who do
the like are punished by those same elders, and yet neither boys nor men
find any pity. For will any one of good sense approve of my being
whipped because, as a boy, I played ball, and so was hindered from
learning quickly those lessons by means of which, as a man, I should
play more unbecomingly? And did he by whom I was beaten do other than
this, who, when he was overcome in any little controversy with a
co-tutor, was more tormented by anger and envy than I when beaten by a
playfellow in a match at ball?<span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
