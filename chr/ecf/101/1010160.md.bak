<span id="vi.X.III-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—He Who Confesseth Rightly Unto
God Best Knoweth Himself.</span>

<span id="vi.X.III-p2"></span>3. What then have I to do with men, that
they should hear my confessions, as if they were going to cure all my
diseases? <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) A people curious to
know the lives of others, but slow to correct their own. Why do they
desire to hear from me what I am, who are unwilling to hear from Thee
what they are? And how can they tell, when they hear from me of myself,
whether I speak the truth, seeing that no man knoweth what is in man,
“save the spirit of man which is in him “? <span
id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) But if they hear from Thee aught
concerning themselves, they will not be able to say, “The Lord lieth.”
For what is it to hear from Thee of themselves, but to know themselves?
And who is he that knoweth himself and saith, “It is false,” unless he
himself lieth? But because “charity believeth all things” <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) (amongst those at all events whom by
union with itself it maketh one), I too, O Lord, also so confess unto
Thee that men may hear, to whom I cannot prove whether I confess the
truth, yet do they believe me whose ears charity openeth unto me.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span id="vi.X.III-Page_143"></span>

<span id="vi.X.III-p6"></span>4. But yet do Thou, my most secret
Physician, make clear to me what fruit I may reap by doing it. For the
confessions of my past sins,—which Thou hast “forgiven” and
“covered,” <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) that Thou mightest
make me happy in Thee, changing my soul by faith and Thy sacrament,—when
they are read and heard, stir up the heart, that it sleep not in despair
and say, “I cannot;” but that it may awake in the love of Thy mercy and
the sweetness of Thy grace, by which he that is weak is strong, <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) if by it he is made conscious of his
own weakness. As for the good, they take delight in hearing of the past
errors of such as are now freed from them; and they delight, not because
they are errors, but because they have been and are so no longer. For
what fruit, then, O Lord my God, to whom my conscience maketh her daily
confession, more confident in the hope of Thy mercy than in her own
innocency,—for what fruit, I beseech Thee, do I confess even to men in
Thy presence by this book what I am at this time, not what I have been?
For that fruit I have both seen and spoken of, but what I am at this
time, at the very moment of making my confessions, divers people desire
to know, both who knew me and who knew me not,—who have heard of or from
me,—but their ear is not at my heart, where I am whatsoever I am. They
are desirous, then, of hearing me confess what I am within, where they
can neither stretch eye, nor ear, nor mind; they desire it as those
willing to believe,—but will they understand? For charity, by which they
are good, says unto them that I do not lie in my confessions, and she in
them believes me.
