<span id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 429.)

<span id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p3.1"></span>To Darius,</span>* <span
id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md) *<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p4.1"></span>His Deservedly Illustrious and Very
Powerful Lord and Dear Son Christ, Augustin Sends Greeting in the
Lord.</span>*

<span id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p5"></span>1. Your character and rank I have
learned from my holy brothers and co-bishops, Urbanus and Novatus. The
former of these became acquainted with you near Carthage, in the town of
Hilari, and more recently in the town of Sicca; the latter at Sitifis.
Through them it has come to pass that I cannot regard you as unknown to
me. For though my bodily weakness and the chill of age do not permit me
to converse with you personally, it cannot on this account be said that
I have not seen you; for the conversation of Urbanus, when he kindly
visited me, and the letters of Novatus, so described to me the features,
not of your face but of your mind, that I have seen you, and have seen
you with all the more pleasure, because I have seen not the outward
appearance but the inner man. These features of your character are
joyfully seen both by us, and through the mercy of God by yourself also,
as in a mirror in the holy Gospel, in which it is written in words
uttered by Him who is truth: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they
shall be called the children of God.” <span
id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994.md)

<span id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p7"></span>2. Those warriors are indeed great and
worthy of singular honour, not only for their consummate bravery, but
also (which is a higher praise) for their eminent fidelity, by whose
labours and dangers, along with the blessing of divine protection and
aid, enemies previously unsubdued are conquered, and peace obtained for
the State, and the provinces reduced to subjection. But it is a higher
glory still to stay war itself with a word, than to slay men with the
sword, and to <span id="page_582">p. 582</span> <span
id="vii.1.CCXXIX-Page_582"></span>procure or maintain peace by peace,
not by war. For those who fight, if they are good men, doubtless seek
for peace; nevertheless it is through blood. Your mission, however, is
to prevent the shedding of blood. Yours, therefore, is the privilege of
averting that calamity which others are under the necessity of
producing. Therefore, my deservedly illustrious and very powerful lord
and very dear son in Christ, rejoice in this singularly great and real
blessing vouchsafed to you, and enjoy it in God, to whom you owe that
you are what you are, and that you undertook the accomplishment of such
a work. May God “strengthen that which He hath wrought for us through
you.” <span id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995.md) Accept this our
salutation, and deign to reply. From the letter of my brother Novatus, I
see that he has taken pains that your learned Excellency should become
acquainted with me also through my works. If, then, you have read what
he has given you, I also shall have become known to your inward
perception. As far as I can judge, they will not greatly displease you
if you have read them in a loving rather than a critical spirit. It is
not much to ask, but it will be a great favour, if for this letter and
my works you send us one letter in reply. I salute with due affection
the pledge of peace, <span id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) which
through the favour of our Lord and God you have happily received.

<span id="vii.1.CCXXIX-p4"></span> This Darius was an officer of
distinction in the service of the Empress Placidia, and was the
instrument of effecting a reconciliation between her and Count Boniface.
He was also successful in obtaining a truce with the Vandals, on which
Augustin congratulates him in this letter.
