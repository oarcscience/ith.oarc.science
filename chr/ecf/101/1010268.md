<span id="vi.XIII.II-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.II-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—All Creatures Subsist from the
Plenitude of Divine Goodness.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.II-p2"></span>2. For of the plenitude of Thy goodness
Thy creature subsists, that a good, which could profit Thee nothing, nor
though of Thee was equal to Thee, might yet be, since it could be made
of Thee. For what did heaven and earth, which Thou madest in the
beginning, deserve of Thee? Let those spiritual and corporeal natures,
which Thou in Thy wisdom madest, declare what they deserve of Thee to
depend thereon,—even the inchoate and formless, each in its own kind,
either spiritual or corporeal, going into excess, and into remote
unlikeness unto Thee (the spiritual, though formless, more excellent
than if it were a formed body; and the corporeal, though formless, more
excellent than if it were altogether nothing), and thus they as formless
would depend upon Thy Word, unless by the same Word they were recalled
to Thy Unity, and endued with form, and from Thee, the one sovereign
Good, were all made very good. How have they deserved of Thee, that they
should be even formless, since they would not be even this except from
Thee?

<span id="vi.XIII.II-p3"></span>3. How has corporeal matter deserved of
Thee, to be even invisible and formless, <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169) since it were not even this hadst
Thou not made it; and therefore since it was not, it could not deserve
of Thee that it should be made? Or how could the inchoate spiritual
creature <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170) deserve of Thee,
that even it should flow darksomely like the deep,—unlike Thee, had it
not been by the same Word turned to that by Whom it was created, and by
Him so enlightened become light, although not equally, yet conformably
to that Form which is equal unto Thee? For as to a body, to be is not
all one with being beautiful, for then it could not be deformed; so also
to a created spirit, to live is not all one with living wisely, for then
it would be wise unchangeably. But it is good <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171) for it always to hold fast unto
Thee, <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172) lest, in turning from
Thee, it lose that light which it hath obtained in turning to Thee,
<span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span
id="vi.XIII.II-Page_191"></span>and relapse into a light resembling the
darksome deep. For even we ourselves, who in respect of the soul are a
spiritual creature, having turned away from Thee, our light, were in
that life “sometimes darkness;” <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173) and do labour amidst the remains of
our darkness, until in Thy Only One we become Thy righteousness, like
the mountains of God. For we have been Thy judgments, which are like the
great deep. <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174)

<span id="vi.XIII.II-p4"></span> [Gen.
1.2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002)<span id="vi.XIII.II-p4.1"></span>.

id="vi.XIII.II-p4.2"></span>

<span id="vi.XIII.II-p5"></span> In his *De Gen. ad Lit*. i. 5, he
maintains that the spiritual creature may have a formless life, since it
has its form—its wisdom and happiness—by being turned to the Word of
God, the Immutable Light of Wisdom.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[190:1172](1010268.htm#fr_1171) <span
id="vi.XIII.II-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.XIII.II-p6"></span> [Ps.
73.28](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#028)<span

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[190:1173](1010268.htm#fr_1172) <span
id="vi.XIII.II-p6.2"></span>

<span id="vi.XIII.II-p7"></span> Similarly, in his *De Civ. Dei*, xii.
1, he argues that true blessedness is to be attained “by adhering to the
Immutable Good, the Supreme God.” This, indeed, imparts the only true
life (see note, p. 133, above); for, as Origen says (*in S. Joh.* ii.
7), “the good man is he who truly exists,” and “to be evil and to be
wicked are the same as not to be.” See notes, pp. 75 and 151, above.

<span id="vi.XIII.II-p9"></span> [Ps.
36.6](../../../bib/vul/psa036.htm#006)<span
id="vi.XIII.II-p9.1"></span>, as in the Vulgate, which renders the
Hebrew more correctly than the Authorized Version. This passage has been
variously interpreted. Augustin makes “the mountains of God” to mean the
saints, prophets, and apostles, while “the great deep” he interprets of
the wicked and sinful. Compare *in Ev. Joh. Tract.* i. 2; and *in Ps.*
xxxv. 7, sec. 10.
