<span id="vi.XIII.XXI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Concerning the Living Soul,
Birds, and Fishes (Ver. 24)—The Sacrament of the Eucharist Being
Regarded.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXI-p2"></span>29. And hereby, in Thy Word, not the
depth of the sea, but the earth parted from the bitterness of the
waters, <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345) bringeth forth not
the creeping and flying creature that hath life, <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346) but the living soul itself. <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347) For now hath it no longer need of
baptism, as the heathen have, and as itself had when it was covered with
the waters,—for no other entrance is there into the kingdom of
heaven, <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348) since Thou hast
appointed that this should be the entrance,—nor does it seek great works
of miracles by which to cause faith; for it is not such that, unless it
shall have seen signs and wonders, it will not believe, <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349) when now the faithful earth is
separated from the waters of the sea, rendered bitter by infidelity; and
“tongues are for a sign, not to those that believe, but to those that
believe not.” <span id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350) Nor then doth
the earth, which Thou hast founded above the waters, <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351) stand in need of that flying kind
which at Thy word the waters brought forth. Send Thy word forth into it
by Thy messengers. For we relate their works, but it is Thou who workest
in them, that in it they may work out a living soul. The earth bringeth
it forth, because the <span id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span
id="vi.XIII.XXI-Page_200"></span>earth is the cause that they work these
things in the soul; as the sea has been the cause that they wrought upon
the moving creatures that have life, and the fowls that fly under the
firmament of heaven, of which the earth hath now no need; although it
feeds on the fish which was taken out of the deep, upon that table which
Thou hast prepared in the presence of those that believe. <span
id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352) For therefore He was raised from
the deep, that He might feed the dry land; and the fowl, though bred in
the sea, is yet multiplied upon the earth. For of the first preachings
of the Evangelists, the infidelity of men was the prominent cause; but
the faithful also are exhorted, and are manifoldly blessed by them day
by day. But the living soul takes its origin from the earth, for it is
not profitable, unless to those already among the faithful, to restrain
themselves from the love of this world, that so their soul may live unto
Thee, which was dead while living in pleasures, <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353) —in death-bearing pleasures, O
Lord, for Thou art the vital delight of the pure heart.

<span id="vi.XIII.XXI-p12"></span>30. Now, therefore, let Thy ministers
work upon the earth,—not as in the waters of infidelity, by announcing
and speaking by miracles, and sacraments, and mystic words; in which
ignorance, the mother of admiration, may be intent upon them, in fear of
those hidden signs. For such is the entrance unto the faith for the sons
of Adam forgetful of Thee, while they hide themselves from Thy
face, <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354) and become a darksome
deep. But let Thy ministers work even as on the dry land, separated from
the whirlpools of the great deep; and let them be an example unto the
faithful, by living before them, and by stimulating them to imitation.
For thus do men hear not with an intent to hear merely, but to act also.
Seek the Lord, and your soul shall live, <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355) that the earth may bring forth the
living soul. “Be not conformed to this world.” <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356) Restrain yourselves from it; the
soul lives by avoiding those things which it dies by affecting. Restrain
yourselves from the unbridled wildness of pride, from the indolent
voluptuousness of luxury, and from the false name of knowledge; <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357) so that wild beasts may be tamed,
the cattle subdued, and serpents harmless. For these are the motions of
the mind in allegory; that is to say, the haughtiness of pride, the
delight of lust, and the poison of curiosity are the motions of the dead
soul; for the soul dies not so as to lose all motion, because it dies by
forsaking the fountain of life, <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358) and so is received by this
transitory world, and is conformed unto it.

<span id="vi.XIII.XXI-p18"></span>31. But Thy Word, O God, is the
fountain of eternal life, and passeth not away; therefore this departure
is kept in check by Thy word when it is said unto us, “Be not conformed
unto this world,” <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359) so that the
earth may bring forth a living soul in the fountain of life,—a soul
restrained in Thy Word, by Thy Evangelists, by imitating the followers
of Thy Christ. <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360) For this is
after his kind; because a man is stimulated to emulation by his
friend. <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361) “Be ye,” saith he,
“as I am, for I am as you are.” <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362) Thus in the living soul shall there
be good beasts, in gentleness of action. For Thou hast commanded,
saying, Go on with thy business in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved
by all men; <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363) and good cattle,
which neither if they eat, shall they over-abound, nor if they do not
eat, have they any want; <span id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364) and
good serpents, not destructive to do hurt, but “wise” <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365) to take heed; and exploring only so
much of this temporal nature as is sufficient that eternity may be
“clearly seen, being understood by the things that are.” <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366) For these animals are subservient
to reason, <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367) when, being kept
in check from a deadly advance, they live, and are good.

<span id="vi.XIII.XXI-p9"></span> “Fundasti super aquas,” which is the
*Old Ver.* of [Ps. cxxxvi. 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006)<span
id="vi.XIII.XXI-p9.1"></span>. Augustin sometimes uses a version with
“firmavit terram,” which corresponds to the LXX., but the Authorized
Version renders the Hebrew more accurately by “stretched out.” In his
comment on this place he applies this text to baptism as being the
entrance into the Church, and in this he is followed by many mediæval
writers.

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[200:1353](1010287.htm#fr_1352) <span

<span id="vi.XIII.XXI-p10"></span> [Ps.
23.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005)<span
id="vi.XIII.XXI-p10.1"></span>. Many of the Fathers interpret this text
of the Lord’s Supper, as Augustin does above. The fish taken out of the
deep, which is fed upon, means Christ, in accordance with the well-known
acrostic of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXI-p10.2"></span>ΙΧΘΥΣ</span>. “If,” he says in his *De
Civ. Dei*, xviii. 23, “you join the initial letters of these five Greek
words, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.XIII.XXI-p10.3"></span>Ἰησοῦς
Χριστὸς Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτὴρ</span>, which mean, ‘Jesus Christ the Son of
God, the Saviour,’ they will make the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXI-p10.4"></span>ἰχθύς</span>,—that is, ‘fish,’ in which
word Christ is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that
is, to exist without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth
of waters.” So likewise we find Tertullian saying in his *De Bapt.*
chap. I.: “Nos pisciculi, secundum <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXI-p10.5"></span>ΙΧΘΥΝ</span> nostrum Jesum Christum in
aqua nascimur; nec aliter quam in aqua permanendo salvi sumus.” See
Bishop Kaye’s *Tertullian*, pp. 43, 44; and sec. 34, below.
