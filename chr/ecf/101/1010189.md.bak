<span id="vi.X.XXXII-p2"></span>48. With the attractions of odours I am
not much troubled. When absent I do not seek them; when present I do not
refuse them; and am prepared ever to be without them. At any rate thus I
appear to myself; perchance I am deceived. For that also is a lamentable
darkness wherein my capacity that is in me is concealed, so that my
mind, making inquiry into herself concerning her own powers, ventures
not readily to credit herself; because that which is already in it is,
for the most part, concealed, unless experience reveal it. And no man
ought to feel secure <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) in this
life, the whole of which is called a temptation, <span
id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) that he, who could be made better from
worse, may not also from better be made worse. Our sole hope, our sole
confidence, our sole assured promise, is Thy mercy.

<span id="vi.X.XXXII-p3"></span> “For some,” says Thomas Taylor (Works,
vol. I. “Christ’s Temptation,” p. 11), “through vain prefidence of God’s
protection, run in times of contagion into infected houses, which upon
just calling a man may: but for one to run out of his calling in the way
of an ordinary visitation, he shall find that God’s angels have
commission to protect him no longer than he is in his way ([Ps.
91.11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.X.XXXII-p3.1"></span>), and that being out of it, this arrow of
the Lord shall sooner hit him than another that is not half so
confident.” We should not, as Fuller quaintly says, “hollo in the ears
of a sleeping temptation;” and when we are tempted, let us remember that
if (Hibbert, *Syntagma Theologicum*, p. 342) “a giant knock while the
door is shut, he may with ease be still kept out; but if once open, that
he gets in but a limb of himself, then there is no course left to keep
out the remaining bulk.” See also Augustin on Peter’s case, *De Corrept.
et Grat.* c. 9.
