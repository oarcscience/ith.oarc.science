<span id="vii.1.LXXXI-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.1.LXXXI-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXXI-p3.1"></span>To Augustin, My Lord Truly Holy, and Most
Blessed Father, Jerome Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXXI-p4"></span>Having anxiously inquired of our holy
brother Firmus regarding your state, I was glad to hear that you are
well. I expected him to bring, or, I should rather say, I insisted upon
his giving me, a letter from you; upon which he told me that he had set
out from Africa without communicating to you his intention. I therefore
send to you my respectful salutations through this brother, who clings
to you with a singular warmth of affection; and at the same time, in
regard to my last letter, I beg you to forgive the modesty which made it
impossible for me to refuse you, when you had so long required me to
write you in reply. That letter, moreover, was not an answer from me to
you, but a confronting of my arguments with yours. And if it was a fault
in me to send a reply (I beseech you hear me patiently), the fault of
him who insisted upon it was still greater. But let us be done with such
quarrelling; let there be sincere brotherliness between us; and
henceforth let us exchange letters, not of controversy, but of mutual
charity. The holy brethren who with me serve the Lord send you cordial
salutations. Salute from us the holy brethren who with you bear Christ’s
easy yoke; especially I beseech you to convey my respectful salutation
to the holy father Alypius, worthy of all esteem. May Christ, our
almighty God, preserve you safe, and not unmindful of me, my lord truly
holy, and most blessed father. If you have read my commentary on Jonah,
I think you will not recur to the ridiculous gourd-debate. If, moreover,
the friend who first assaulted me with his sword has been driven back by
my pen, I rely upon your good feeling and equity to lay blame on the one
who brought, and not on the one who repelled, the accusation. Let us, if
you please, exercise ourselves <span

wounding each other.
