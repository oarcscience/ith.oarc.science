<span id="vi.XIII.XXXI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXXI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—We Do Not See “That It Was
Good” But Through the Spirit of God Which is in Us.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXI-p2"></span>46. But as for those who through Thy
Spirit see these things, Thou seest in them. When therefore, they see
that these things are good, Thou seest that they are good; and
whatsoever things for Thy sake are pleasing, Thou art pleased in them;
and those things which through Thy Spirit are pleasing unto us, are
pleasing unto Thee in us. “For what man knoweth the things of a man,
save the spirit of a man which is in him? Even so the things of God
knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we,” saith he, “have received
not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we
might know the things that are freely given to us of God.” <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md) And I am reminded to say, “Truly,
‘the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God;’ how, then, do
we also know ‘what things are given us by God’?” It is answered unto me,
“Because the things which we know by His Spirit, even these ‘knoweth no
man, but the Spirit of God.’ For, as it is rightly said unto those who
were to speak by the Spirit of God, ‘It is not ye that speak,’ <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) so is it rightly said to them who
know by the Spirit of God, ‘It is not ye that know.’ None the less,
then, is it rightly said to those that see by the Spirit of God, ‘It is
not ye that see;’ so whatever they see by the Spirit of God that it is
good, it is not they, but God who ‘sees that it is good.’” It is one
thing, then, for a man to suppose that to be bad which is good, as the
fore-named do; another, that what is good a man should see to be good
(as Thy creatures are pleasing unto many, because they are good, whom,
however, Thou pleasest not in them when they wish to enjoy them rather
than enjoy Thee); and another, that when a man sees a thing to be good,
God should in him see that it is good,—that in truth He may be loved in
that which He made, <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md) who
cannot be loved unless by the Holy Ghost, which He hath given. “Because
the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
given unto us;” <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) by whom we
see that whatsoever in any degree is, is good. Because it is from Him
who Is not in any degree, but He Is that He Is.
