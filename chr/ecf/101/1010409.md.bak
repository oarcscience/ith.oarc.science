<span id="vii.1.CIII"></span>

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 409.)

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CIII-p3.1"></span>To My Lord and Brother, Augustin, Rightly
and Justly Worthy of Esteem and of All Possible Honour, Nectarius Sends
Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p4"></span>1. In reading the letter of your
Excellency, in which you have overthrown the worship of idols and the
ritual of their temples, <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) I
seemed to myself to hear the voice of a philosopher, not of such a
philosopher as the academician of whom they say, that having neither new
doctrine to propound nor earlier statements of his own to defend, he was
wont to sit in gloomy corners on the ground absorbed in some deep
reverie, with his knees drawn back to his forehead, and his head buried
between them, contriving how he might as a detractor assail the
discoveries or cavil at the statements by which others had earned
renown; nay, the form which rose under the spell of your eloquence and
stood before my eyes was rather that of the great statesman Cicero, who,
having been crowned with laurels for saving the lives of many of his
countrymen, carried the trophies won in his forensic victories into the
wondering schools of Greek philosophy, when, as one pausing for <span
id="page_426">p. 426</span> <span
id="vii.1.CIII-Page_426"></span>breath, he laid down the trumpet of
sonorous voice and language which he had blown with blast of just
indignation against those who had broken the laws and conspired against
the life of the republic, and, adopting the fashion of the Grecian
mantle, unfastened and threw back over his shoulders the toga’s ample
folds.

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p6"></span>2. I therefore listened with pleasure
when you urged us to the worship and religion of the only supreme God;
and when you counselled us to look to our heavenly fatherland, I
received the exhortation with joy. For you were obviously speaking to me
not of any city confined by encircling ramparts, nor of that
commonwealth on this earth which the writings of philosophers have
mentioned and declared to have all mankind as its citizens, but of that
City which is inhabited and possessed by the great God, and by the
spirits which have earned this recompense from Him, to which, by diverse
roads and pathways, all religions aspire,—the City which we are not able
in language to describe, but which perhaps we might by thinking
apprehend. But while this City ought therefore to be, above all others,
desired and loved, I am nevertheless of opinion that we are bound not to
prove unfaithful to our own native land,—the land which first imparted
to us the enjoyment of the light of day, in which we were nursed and
educated, and (to pass to what is specially relevant in this case) the
land by rendering services to which men obtain a home prepared for them
in heaven after the death of the body; for, in the opinion of the most
learned, promotion to that celestial City is granted to those men who
have deserved well of the cities which gave them birth, and a higher
experience of fellowship with God is the portion of those who are proved
to have contributed by their counsels or by their labours to the welfare
of their native land.

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p7"></span>As to the remark which you were pleased
wittily to make regarding our town, that it has been made conspicuous
not so much by the achievements of warriors as by the conflagrations of
incendiaries, and that it has produced thorns rather than flowers, this
is not the severest reproof that might have been given, for we know that
flowers are for the most part borne on thorny bushes. For who does not
know that even roses grow on briars, and that in the bearded heads of
grain the ears are guarded by spikes, and that, in general, pleasant and
painful things are found blended together?

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p8"></span>3. The last statement in your
Excellency’s letter was, that neither capital punishment nor bloodshed
is demanded in order to compensate for the wrong done to the Church, but
that the offenders must be deprived of the possessions which they most
fear to lose. But in my deliberate judgment, though, of course, I may be
mistaken, it is a more grievous thing to be deprived of one’s property
than to be deprived of life. For, as you know, it is an observation
frequently recurring in the whole range of literature, that death
terminates the experience of all evils, but that a life of indigence
only confers upon us an eternity of wretchedness; for it is worse to
live miserably than to put an end to our miseries by death. This fact,
also, is declared by the whole nature and method of your work, in which
you support the poor, minister healing to the diseased, and apply
remedies to the bodies of those who are in pain, and, in short, make it
your business to prevent the afflicted from feeling the protracted
continuance of their sufferings.

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p9"></span>Again, as to the degree of demerit in
the faults of some as compared with others, it is of no importance what
the quality of the fault may seem to be in a case in which forgiveness
is craved. For, in the first place, if penitence procures forgiveness
and expiates the crime—and surely he is penitent who begs pardon and
humbly embraces the feet of the party whom he has offended—and if,
moreover, as is the opinion of some philosophers, all faults are alike,
pardon ought to be bestowed upon all without distinction. One of our
citizens may have spoken somewhat rudely: this was a fault; another may
have perpetrated an insult or an injury: this was equally a fault;
another may have violently taken what was not his own: this is reckoned
a crime; another may have attacked buildings devoted to secular or to
sacred purposes: he ought not to be for this crime placed beyond the
reach of pardon. Finally, there would be no occasion for pardon if there
were no foregoing faults.

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p10"></span>4. Having now replied to your letter,
not as the letter deserved, but to the best of my ability, such as it
is, I beg and implore you (oh that I were in your presence, that you
might also see my tears!) to consider again and again who you are, what
is your professed character, and what is the business to which your life
is devoted. Reflect upon the appearance presented by a town from which
men doomed to torture are dragged forth; think of the lamentations of
mothers and wives, of sons and of fathers; think of the shame felt by
those who may return, set at liberty indeed, but having undergone the
torture; think what sorrow and groaning the sight of their wounds and
scars must renew. And when you have pondered all these things, first
think of God, and think of your good name among men; or rather think of
what friendly charity and the bonds of common humanity require at your
hands, and seek to be praised not by punishing but by pardoning the
offenders. And such things may indeed be said regarding your treatment
of those whom actual guilt con<span id="page_427">p. 427</span> <span
id="vii.1.CIII-Page_427"></span>demns on their own confession: to these
persons you have, out of regard to your religion, granted pardon; and
for this I shall always praise you. But now it is scarcely possible to
express the greatness of that cruelty which pursues the innocent, and
summons those to stand trial on a capital charge of whom it is certain
that they had no share in the crimes alleged. If it so happen that they
are acquitted, consider, I beseech you, with what ill-will their
acquittal must be regarded by their accusers who of their own accord
dismissed the guilty from the bar, but let the innocent go only when
they were defeated in their attempts against them.

<span id="vii.1.CIII-p11"></span>May the supreme God be your keeper, and
preserve you as a bulwark of His religion and an ornament to our
country.
