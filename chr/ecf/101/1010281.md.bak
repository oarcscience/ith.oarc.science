<span id="vi.XIII.XV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Allegorical Explanation of the
Firmament and Upper Works, Ver. 6.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XV-p2"></span>16. Or who but Thou, our God, made for
us that firmament <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) of
authority over us in Thy divine Scripture? <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md) As it is said, For heaven shall be
folded up like a scroll; <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md) and
now it is extended over us like a skin. <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md) For Thy divine Scripture is of more
sublime authority, since those mortals through whom Thou didst dispense
it unto us underwent mortality. And Thou knowest, O Lord, Thou knowest,
how Thou with skins didst clothe men <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md) when by sin they became mortal.
Whence as a skin hast Thou stretched out the firmament of Thy
Book; <span id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md) that is to say, Thy
harmonious words, which by the ministry of mortals Thou hast spread over
us. For by their very death is that solid firmament of authority in Thy
discourses set forth by them more sublimely extended above all things
that are under it, the which, while they were living here, was not so
eminently extended. <span id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md) Thou
hadst not as yet spread abroad the heaven like a skin; Thou hadst not as
yet noised everywhere the report of their deaths.

<span id="vi.XIII.XV-p10"></span>17. Let us look, O Lord, “upon the
heavens, the work of Thy fingers;” <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md) clear from our eyes that mist with
which Thou hast covered them. There is that testimony of Thine which
giveth wisdom unto the little ones. <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267.md) Perfect, O my God, Thy praise out
of the mouth of babes and sucklings. <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md) Nor have we known any other books
so destructive to pride, so destructive to the enemy and the
defender, <span id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md) who resisteth Thy
reconciliation in defence of his own sins. <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270.md) I know not, O Lord, I know not
other such “pure” <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271.md) words which
so persuade me to confession, and make my neck submissive to Thy yoke,
and invite me to serve Thee for nought. Let me understand these things,
good Father. Grant this to me, placed under them; because Thou hast
established these things for those placed under them.

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span id="vi.XIII.XV-Page_196"></span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XV-p17"></span>18. Other “waters” there be “above”
this “firmament,” I believe immortal, and removed from earthly
corruption. Let them praise Thy Name,—those super-celestial people,
Thine angels, who have no need to look up at this firmament, or by
reading to attain the knowledge of Thy Word,—let them praise Thee. For
they always behold Thy face, <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272.md)
and therein read without any syllables in time what Thy eternal will
willeth. They read, they choose, they love. <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) They are always reading; and that
which they read never passeth away. For, by choosing and by loving, they
read the very unchangeableness of Thy counsel. Their book is not closed,
nor is the scroll folded up, <span id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md)
because Thou Thyself art this to them, yea, and art so eternally;
because Thou hast appointed them above this firmament, which Thou hast
made firm over the weakness of the lower people, where they might look
up and learn Thy mercy, announcing in time Thee who hast made times.
“For Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and Thy faithfulness reacheth
unto the clouds.” <span id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md) The clouds
pass away, but the heaven remaineth. The preachers of Thy Word pass away
from this life into another; but Thy Scripture is spread abroad over the
people, even to the end of the world. Yea, both heaven and earth shall
pass away, but Thy Words shall not pass away. <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276.md) Because the scroll shall be rolled
together, <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) and the grass over
which it was spread shall with its goodliness pass away; but Thy Word
remaineth for ever, <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md) which now
appeareth unto us in the dark image of the clouds, and through the glass
of the heavens, not as it is; <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md)
because we also, although we be the well-beloved of Thy Son, yet it hath
not yet appeared what we shall be. <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) He looketh through the
lattice <span id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) of our flesh, and He
is fair-speaking, and hath inflamed us, and we run after His
odours. <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md) But “when He shall
appear, then shall we be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.” <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) As He is, O Lord, shall we see Him,
although the time be not yet.

<span id="vi.XIII.XV-p8"></span> That is, the firmament of Scripture was
after man’s sin stretched over him as a parchment scroll,—stretched over
him for his enlightenment by the ministry of mortal men. This idea is
enlarged on *in Ps.* viii. 4, sec. 7, etc., xviii. sec. 2, xxxii. 6, 7,
and cxlvi. 8, sec. 15.

regulates the motions of the stars or the ebbing and flowing of the
tides, may change at the “end of the world.” But the moral law can know
no change, for while the first is arbitrary, the second is absolute. On
the difference between moral and natural law, see Candlish, *Reason and
Revelation*, “Conscience and the Bible.”
