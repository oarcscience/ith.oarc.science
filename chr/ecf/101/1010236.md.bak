id="vi.XII.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Of the Darkness Upon the Deep,
and of the Invisible and Formless Earth.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.III-p2"></span>3. And truly this earth was invisible
and formless, <span id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) and there was I
know not what profundity of the deep upon which there was no
light, <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) because it had no
form. Therefore didst Thou command that it should be written, that
darkness was upon the face of the deep; what else was it than the
absence of light? <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) For had
there been light, where should it have been save by being above all,
showing itself aloft, and enlightening? Darkness therefore was upon it,
because the light above was absent; as silence is there present where
sound is not. And what is it to have silence there, but not to have
sound there? Hast not Thou, O Lord, taught this soul which confesseth
unto Thee? Hast not Thou taught me, O Lord, that before Thou didst form
and separate this formless matter, there was nothing, neither colour,
nor figure, nor body, nor spirit? Yet not altogether nothing; there was
a certain formlessness without any shape.
