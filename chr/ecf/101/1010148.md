Reads the Prophecies of Isaiah, But Does Not Understand Them.</span>

<span id="vi.IX.V-p2"></span>13. The vintage vacation being ended, I
gave the citizens of Milan notice that they might provide their scholars
with another seller of words; because both of my election to serve Thee,
and my inability, by reason of the difficulty of breathing and the pain
in my chest, to continue the Professorship. And by letters I notified to
Thy bishop, <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750) the holy man
Ambrose, my former errors and present resolutions, with a view to his
advising me which of Thy books it was best for me to read, so that I
might be readier and fitter for the reception of such great grace. He
recommended Isaiah the Prophet; <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751)
I believe, because he foreshows more clearly than others the gospel, and
the calling of the Gentiles. But I, not understanding the first portion
of the book, and imagining the whole to be like it, laid it aside,
intending to take it up hereafter, when better practised in our Lord’s
words.
