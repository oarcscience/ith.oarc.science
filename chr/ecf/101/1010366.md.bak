<span id="vii.1.LX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LX-p1.1"></span>Letter LX.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LX-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.)

<span id="vii.1.LX-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LX-p3.1"></span>To Father Aurelius, My Lord Most Blessed, and
Revered with Most Justly Merited Respect, My Brother in the Priesthood,
Most Sincerely Beloved, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LX-p4"></span>1. I have received no letter from your
Holiness since we parted; but I have now read a letter of your Grace
concerning Donatus and his brother, and I have long hesitated as to the
<span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="vii.1.LX-Page_318"></span>reply which I ought to give. After
frequently reconsidering what is in such a case conducive to the welfare
of those whom we serve in Christ, and seek to nourish in Him, nothing
has occurred to me which would alter my opinion that it is not right to
give occasion for God’s servants to think that promotion to a better
position is more readily given to those who have become worse. Such a
rule would make monks less careful of falling, and a most grievous wrong
would be done to the order of clergy, if those who have deserted their
duty as monks be chosen to serve as clergy, seeing that our custom is to
select for that office only the more tried and superior men of those who
continue faithful to their calling as monks; unless, perchance, the
common people are to be taught to joke at our expense, saying “a bad
monk makes a good clerk,” as they are wont to say that “a poor
flute-player makes a good singer.” It would be an intolerable calamity
if we were to encourage the monks to such fatal pride, and were to
consent to brand with so grievous disgrace the clerical order to which
we ourselves belong: seeing that sometimes even a good monk is scarcely
qualified to be a good clerk; for though he be proficient in
self-denial, he may lack the necessary instruction, or be disqualified
by some personal defect.

<span id="vii.1.LX-p5"></span>2. I believe, however, that your Holiness
understood these monks to have left the monastery with my consent, in
order that they might rather be useful to the people of their own
district; but this was not the case: of their own accord they departed,
of their own accord they deserted us, notwithstanding my resisting, from
a regard to their welfare, to the utmost of my power. As to Donatus,
seeing that he has obtained ordination before we could arrive at any
decision in the Council <span id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) as to
his case, do as your wisdom may guide you; it may be that his proud
obstinacy has been subdued. But as to his brother, who was the chief
cause of Donatus leaving the monastery, I know not what to write, since
you know what I think of him. I do not presume to oppose what may seem
best to one of your wisdom, rank, and piety; and I hope with all my
heart that you will do whatever you judge most profitable for the
members of the Church.
