id="vi.XI.XI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—They Who Ask This Have Not as Yet
Known the Eternity of God, Which is Exempt from the Relation of
Time.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XI-p2"></span>13. Those who say these things do not as
yet understand Thee, O Thou Wisdom of God, Thou light of souls; not as
yet do they understand how these things be made which are made by and in
Thee. They even endeavour to comprehend things eternal; but as yet their
heart flieth about in the past and future motions of things, and is
still wavering. Who shall hold it and fix it, that it may rest a little,
and by degrees catch the glory of that everstanding eternity, and
compare it with the times which never stand, and see that it is
incomparable; and that a long time cannot become long, save from the
many motions that pass by, which cannot at the same instant be
prolonged; but that in the Eternal nothing passeth away, but that the
whole is present; but no time is wholly present; and let him see that
all time past is forced on by the future, and that all the future
followeth from the past, and that all, both past and future, is created
and issues from that which is always present? Who will hold the heart of
man, that it may stand still, and see how the still-standing eternity,
itself neither future nor past, uttereth the times future and past? Can
my hand accomplish this, or the hand of my mouth by persuasion bring
about a thing so great? <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md)
