<span id="vii.1.LXXVII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LXXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXVII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXVII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 404.)

<span id="vii.1.LXXVII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXVII-p3.1"></span>To Felix and Hilarinus, My Lords most
Beloved, and Brethren Worthy of All Honour, Augustin Sends Greeting in
the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXVII-p4"></span>1. I do not wonder to see the minds of
believers disturbed by Satan, whom resist, continuing in the hope which
rests on the promises of God, who cannot lie, who has not only
condescended to promise in eternity rewards to us who believe and hope
in Him, and who persevere in love unto the end, but has also foretold
that in time offences by which our faith must be tried and proved shall
not be wanting; for He said, “Because iniquity shall abound, the love
<span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="vii.1.LXXVII-Page_345"></span>of many shall wax cold;” but He added
immediately, “and he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be
saved.” <span id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md) Why, therefore,
should it seem strange that men bring calumnies against the servants of
God, and being unable to turn them aside from an upright life, endeavour
to blacken their reputation, seeing that they do not cease uttering
blasphemies daily against God, the Lord of these servants, if they are
displeased by anything in which the execution of His righteous and
secret counsel is contrary to their desire? Wherefore I appeal to your
wisdom, my lords most beloved, and brethren worthy of all honour, and
exhort you to exercise your minds in the way which best becomes
Christians, setting over against the empty calumnies and groundless
suspicions of men the written word of God, which has foretold that these
things should come, and has warned us to meet them with fortitude.

<span id="vii.1.LXXVII-p6"></span>2. Let me therefore say in a few words
to your Charity, that the presbyter Boniface has not been discovered by
me to be guilty of any crime, and that I have never believed, and do not
yet believe, any charge brought against him. How, then, could I order
his name to be deleted from the roll of presbyters, when filled with
alarm by that word of our Lord in the gospel: “With what judgment ye
judge ye shall be judged”? <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md)
For, seeing that the dispute which has arisen between him and Spes has
by their consent been submitted to divine arbitration in a way which, if
you desire it, can be made known to you, <span
id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) who am I, that I should presume to
anticipate the divine award by deleting or passing over his name? As a
bishop, I ought not rashly to suspect him; and as being only a man, I
cannot decide infallibly concerning things which are hidden from me.
Even in secular matters, when an appeal has been made to a higher
authority, all procedure is sisted while the case awaits the decision
from which there is no appeal; because if anything were changed while
the matter is depending on his arbitration, this would be an insult to
the higher tribunal. And how great the distance between even the highest
human authority and the divine!

<span id="vii.1.LXXVII-p9"></span>May the mercy of the Lord our God
never forsake you, my lords most beloved, and brethren worthy of all
honour.
