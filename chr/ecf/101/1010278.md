id="vi.XIII.XII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Allegorical Explanation of
Genesis, Chap. I., Concerning the Origin of the Church and Its
Worship.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XII-p2"></span>13. Proceed in thy confession, say to
the Lord thy God, O my faith, Holy, Holy, Holy, O Lord my God, in Thy
name have we been baptized, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in Thy name do
we baptize, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) because among us also in His Christ
did God make heaven and earth, namely, the spiritual and carnal people
of His Church. <span id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md) Yea, and our
earth, before it received the “form of doctrine,” <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) was invisible and formless, and we
were covered with the darkness of ignorance. For Thou correctest man for
iniquity, <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) and “Thy judgments
are a great deep.” <span id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md) But
because Thy Spirit was “borne over the waters,” <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md) Thy mercy forsook not our
misery, <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md) and Thou saidst, “Let
there be light,” “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand.” <span id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) Repent ye, let there
be light. <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) And because our
soul was troubled within us, <span id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md)
we remembered Thee, O Lord, from the land of Jordan, and that
mountain <span id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) equal unto Thyself,
but little for our sakes; and upon our being displeased with our
darkness, we turned unto Thee, “and there was light.” And, behold, we
were sometimes darkness, but now light in the Lord. <span

<span id="vi.XIII.XII-p4"></span> He similarly interprets “heaven and
earth” in his *De Gen. ad Lit.* ii. 4. With this compare Chrysostom’s
illustration in his *De Pænit.* hom. 8. The Church is like the ark of
Noah, yet different from it. Into that ark as the animals entered, so
they came forth. The fox remained a fox, the hawk a hawk, and the
serpent a serpent. But with the spiritual ark it is not so, for in it
evil dispositions are changed. This illustration of Chrysostom is used
with an effective but rough eloquence by the Italian preacher Segneri,
in his *Quaresimale*, serm. iv. sec.
