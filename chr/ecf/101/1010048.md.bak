<span id="vi.III.II-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.III.II-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—In Public Spectacles He is Moved
by an Empty Compassion. He is Attacked by a Troublesome Spiritual
Disease.</span>

<span id="vi.III.II-p2"></span>2. Stage-plays also drew me away, full of
representations of my miseries and of fuel to my fire. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) Why does man like to be made sad when
viewing doleful and tragical scenes, which yet he himself would by no
means suffer? And yet he wishes, as a spectator, to experience from them
a sense of grief, and in this very grief his pleasure consists. What is
this but wretched insanity? For a man is more affected with these
actions, the less free he is from such affections. Howsoever, when he
suffers in his own person, it is the custom to style it “misery” but
when he compassionates others, then it is styled “mercy.” <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) But what kind of mercy is it that
arises from fictitious and scenic passions? The hearer is not expected
to relieve, but merely invited to grieve; and the more he grieves, the
more he applauds the actor of these fictions. And if the misfortunes of
the characters (whether of olden times or merely imaginary) be so
represented as not to touch the feelings of the spectator, he goes away
disgusted and censorious; but if his feelings be touched, he sits it out
attentively, and sheds tears of joy.

<span id="vi.III.II-p5"></span>3. Are sorrows, then, also loved? Surely
all men desire to rejoice? Or, as man wishes to be miserable, is he,
nevertheless, glad to be merciful, which, because it cannot exist
without passion, for this cause alone are passions loved? This also is
from that vein of friendship. But whither does it go? Whither does it
flow? Wherefore runs it into that torrent of pitch, <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) seething forth those huge tides of
loathsome lusts into which it is changed and transformed, being of its
own will cast away and corrupted from its celestial clearness? Shall,
then, mercy be repudiated? By no means. Let us, therefore, love sorrows
sometimes. But beware of uncleanness, O my soul, under the protection of
my God, the God of our fathers, who is to be praised and exalted above
all for ever, <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) beware of
uncleanness. For I have not now ceased to have compassion; but then in
the theatres I sympathized with lovers when they sinfully enjoyed one
another, although this was <span id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span
id="vi.III.II-Page_61"></span>done fictitiously in the play. And when
they lost one another, I grieved with them, as if pitying them, and yet
had delight in both. But now-a-days I feel much more pity for him that
delighteth in his wickedness, than for him who is counted as enduring
hardships by failing to obtain some pernicious pleasure, and the loss of
some miserable felicity. This, surely, is the truer mercy, but grief
hath no delight in it. For though he that condoles with the unhappy be
approved for his office of charity, yet would he who had real compassion
rather there were nothing for him to grieve about. For if goodwill be
ill-willed (which it cannot), then can he who is truly and sincerely
commiserating wish that there should be some unhappy ones, that he might
commiserate them. Some grief may then be justified, none loved. For thus
dost Thou, O Lord God, who lovest souls far more purely than do we, and
art more incorruptibly compassionate, although Thou art wounded by no
sorrow. “And who is sufficient for these things?” <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md)

<span id="vi.III.II-p9"></span>4. But I, wretched one, then loved to
grieve, and sought out what to grieve at, as when, in another man’s
misery, though reigned and counterfeited, that delivery of the actor
best pleased me, and attracted me the most powerfully, which moved me to
tears. What marvel was it that an unhappy sheep, straying from Thy
flock, and impatient of Thy care, I became infected with a foul disease?
And hence came my love of griefs—not such as should probe me too deeply,
for I loved not to suffer such things as I loved to look upon, but such
as, when hearing their fictions, should lightly affect the surface; upon
which, like as with empoisoned nails, followed burning, swelling,
putrefaction, and horrible corruption. Such was my life! But was it
life, O my God?

<span id="vi.III.II-p3"></span> The early Fathers strongly reprobated
stage-plays, and those who went to them were excluded from baptism. This
is not to be wondered at, when we learn that “even the laws of Rome
prohibited actors from being enrolled as citizens” (*De Civ. Dei*, ii.
14), and that they were accounted infamous (Tertullian, *De Spectac.*
sec. xxii.). See also Tertullian, *De Pudicitia*, c. vii.

<span id="vi.III.II-p6"></span> An allusion, probably, as Watts
suggests, to the sea of Sodom, which, according to Tacitus (*Hist*. book
v.), throws up bitumen “at stated seasons of the year.” Tacitus likewise
alludes to its pestiferous odour, and to its being deadly to birds and
fish. See also [Gen. 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#003.md),
