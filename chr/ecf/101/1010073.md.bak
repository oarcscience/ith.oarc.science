<span id="vi.IV.XIV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IV.XIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Concerning the Books Which He
Wrote “On the Fair and Fit,” Dedicated to Hierius.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.XIV-p2"></span>21. But what was it that prompted me, O
Lord my God, to dedicate these books to Hierius, an orator of Rome, whom
I knew not by <span id="page_75">p. 75</span> <span
id="vi.IV.XIV-Page_75"></span>sight, but loved the man for the fame of
his learning, for which he was renowned, and some words of his which I
had heard, and which had pleased me? But the more did he please me in
that he pleased others, who highly extolled him, astonished that a
native of Syria, instructed first in Greek eloquence, should afterwards
become a wonderful Latin orator, and one so well versed in studies
pertaining unto wisdom. Thus a man is commended and loved when absent.
Doth this love enter into the heart of the hearer from the mouth of the
commender? Not so. But through one who loveth is another inflamed. For
hence he is loved who is commended when the commender is believed to
praise him with an unfeigned heart; that is, when he that loves him
praises him.

<span id="vi.IV.XIV-p3"></span>22. Thus, then, loved I men upon the
judgment of men, not upon Thine, O my God, in which no man is deceived.
But yet why not as the renowned charioteer, as the huntsman <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) known far and wide by a vulgar
popularity—but far otherwise, and seriously, and so as I would desire to
be myself commended? For I would not that they should commend and love
me as actors are,—although I myself did commend and love them,—but I
would prefer being unknown than so known, and even being hated than so
loved. Where now are these influences of such various and divers kinds
of loves distributed in one soul? What is it that I am in love with in
another, which, if I did not hate, I should not detest and repel from
myself, seeing we are equally men? For it does not follow that because a
good horse is loved by him who would not, though he might, be that
horse, the same should therefore be affirmed by an actor, who partakes
of our nature. Do I then love in a man that which I, who am a man, hate
to be? Man himself is a great deep, whose very hairs Thou numberest, O
Lord, and they fall not to the ground without Thee. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) And yet are the hairs of his head more
readily numbered than are his affections and the movements of his heart.

<span id="vi.IV.XIV-p6"></span>23. But that orator was of the kind that
I so loved as I wished myself to be such a one; and I erred through an
inflated pride, and was “carried about with every wind,” <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) but yet was piloted by Thee, though
very secretly. And whence know I, and whence confidently confess I unto
Thee that I loved him more because of the love of those who praised him,
than for the very things for which they praised him? Because had he been
upraised, and these self-same men had dispraised him, and with dispraise
and scorn told the same things of him, I should never have been so
inflamed and provoked to love him. And yet the things had not been
different, nor he himself different, but only the affections of the
narrators. See where lieth the impotent soul that is not yet sustained
by the solidity of truth! Just as the blasts of tongues blow from the
breasts of conjecturers, so is it tossed this way and that, driven
forward and backward, and the light is obscured to it and the truth not
perceived. And behold it is before us. And to me it was a great matter
that my style and studies should be known to that man; the which if he
approved, I were the more stimulated, but if he disapproved, this vain
heart of mine, void of Thy solidity, had been offended. And yet that
“fair and fit,” about which I wrote to him, I reflected on with
pleasure, and contemplated it, and admired it, though none joined me in
doing so.
