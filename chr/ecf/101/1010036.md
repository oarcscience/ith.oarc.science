Youth.</span>

<span id="vi.II_1.I-p3"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.II_1.I-p3.1"></span>I Will</span> now call to mind my past
foulness, and the carnal corruptions of my soul, not because I love
them, but that I may love Thee, O my God. For love of Thy love do I it,
recalling, in the very bitterness of my remembrance, my most vicious
ways, that Thou mayest grow sweet to me,—Thou sweetness without
deception! Thou sweetness happy and assured!—and re-collecting myself
out of that my dissipation, in which I was torn to pieces, while, turned
away from Thee the One, I lost myself among many vanities. For I even
longed in my youth formerly to be satisfied with worldly things, and I
dared to grow wild again with various and shadowy loves; my form
consumed away, <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) and I became
corrupt in Thine eyes, pleasing myself, and eager to please in the eyes
of men.
