<span id="vi.XII.XXXII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XXXII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—First, the Sense of the
Writer is to Be Discovered, Then that is to Be Brought Out Which Divine
Truth Intended.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XXXII-p2"></span>43. Finally, O Lord, who art God, and
not flesh and blood, if man doth see anything less, <span
id="page_189">p. 189</span> <span id="vi.XII.XXXII-Page_189"></span>can
anything lie hid from “Thy good Spirit,” who shall “lead me into the
land of uprightness,” <span id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165) which
Thou Thyself, by those words, wert about to reveal to future readers,
although he through whom they were spoken, amid the many interpretations
that might have been found, fixed on but one? Which, if it be so, let
that which he thought on be more exalted than the rest. But to us, O
Lord, either point out the same, or any other true one which may be
pleasing unto Thee; so that whether Thou makest known to us that which
Thou didst to that man of Thine, or some other by occasion of the same
words, yet Thou mayest feed us, not error deceive us. <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166) Behold, O Lord my God, how many
things we have written concerning a few words,—how many, I beseech Thee!
What strength of ours, what ages would suffice for all Thy books after
this manner? Permit me, therefore, in these more briefly to confess unto
Thee, and to select some one true, certain, and good sense, that Thou
shall inspire, although many senses offer themselves, where many,
indeed, I may; this being the faith of my confession, that if I should
say that which Thy minister felt, rightly and profitably, this I should
strive for; the which if I shall not attain, yet I may say that which
Thy Truth willed through Its words to say unto me, which said also unto
him what It willed.

<span id="vi.XII.XXXII-p4"></span> Augustin, as we have seen (see notes,
pp. 65 and 92), was frequently addicted to allegorical interpretation,
but he, none the less, laid stress on the necessity of avoiding obscure
and allegorical passages when it was necessary to convince the opponent
of Christianity (*De Unit. Eccl.* ch. 5). It should also be noted that,
however varied the meaning deduced from a doubtful Scripture, he ever
maintained that such meaning must be *sacræ fidei congruam.* Compare *De
Gen. ad Lit.* end of book i.; and *ibid.* viii. 4 and 7. See also notes,
pp. 164 and 178, above.
