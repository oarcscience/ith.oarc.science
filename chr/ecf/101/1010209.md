<span id="vi.XI.VIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XI.VIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—That Word Itself is the
Beginning of All Things, in the Which We are Instructed as to
Evangelical Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.VIII-p2"></span>10. Why is this, I beseech Thee, O Lord
my God? I see it, however; but how I shall express it, I know not,
unless that everything which begins to be and ceases to be, then begins
and ceases when in Thy eternal Reason it is known that it ought to begin
or cease where nothing beginneth or ceaseth. The same is Thy Word, which
is also “the Beginning,” because also It speaketh unto us. <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032) Thus, in the gospel He speaketh
through the flesh; and this sounded outwardly in the ears of men, that
it might be believed and sought inwardly, and that it might be found in
the eternal Truth, where the good and only Master teacheth all His
disciples. There, O Lord, I hear Thy voice, the voice of one speaking
unto me, since He speaketh unto us who teacheth us. But He that teacheth
us not, although He speaketh, speaketh not to us. Moreover, who teacheth
us, unless it be the immutable Truth? For even when we are admonished
through a changeable creature, we are led to the Truth immutable. There
we learn truly while we stand and hear Him, and rejoice greatly “because
of the Bridegroom’s voice,” <span id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033)
restoring us to that whence we are. And, therefore, the Beginning,
because unless It remained, there would not, where we strayed, be
whither to return. But when we return from error, it is by knowing that
we return. But that we may know, He teacheth us, because He is the
Beginning and speaketh unto us.

<span id="vi.XI.VIII-p3"></span> [John
8.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025)<span
id="vi.XI.VIII-p3.1"></span>, *Old Ver.* Though some would read, *Qui et
loquitur*, making it correspond to the Vulgate, instead of *Quia et
loquitur*, as above, the latter is doubtless the correct reading, since
we find the text similarly quoted *in Ev. Joh. Tract.* xxxviii. 11,
where he enlarges on “The Beginning,” comparing *principium* with <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.XI.VIII-p3.2"></span>ἄρχη</span>. It will
assist to the understanding of this section to refer to the early part
of the note on p. 107, above, where the Platonic view of the *Logos*, as
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.XI.VIII-p3.3"></span>ἐνδιάθετος</span>
and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.XI.VIII-p3.4"></span>προφορικός</span>, or in the “bosom of the
Father” and “made flesh,” is given; which terminology, as Dr. Newman
tells us (*Arians*, pt. i. c. 2, sec. 4), was accepted by the Church.
Augustin, consistently with this idea, says (on [John viii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025)<span id="vi.XI.VIII-p3.5"></span>,
as above): “For if the Beginning, as it is in itself, had remained so
with the Father as not to receive the form of a servant and speak as man
with men, how could they have believed in Him, since their weak hearts
could not have heard the word intelligently without some voice that
would appeal to their senses? Therefore, said He, believe me to be the
Beginning; for that you may believe, I not only am, but also speak to
you.” Newman, as quoted above, may be referred to for the significance
of <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.XI.VIII-p3.6"></span>ἄρχη</span> as
applied to the Son, and *ibid.* sec. 3, also, on the “Word.” For the
difference between a mere “voice” and the “Word,” compare Aug. *Serm.*
ccxciii. sec. 3, and Origen, *In Joann.* ii. 36.
