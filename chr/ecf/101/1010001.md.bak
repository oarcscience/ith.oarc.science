<span id="ii-p1"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="ii-p1.1"></span>Preface</span>

<span id="ii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="ii-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="ii-p3.1"></span>Encouraged</span> by the assured co-operation of
competent Patristic scholars of Great Britain and the United States, I
have undertaken the general editorship of a <span class="c9"><span
id="ii-p3.2"></span>Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers
of the Christian Church.</span> It is to embrace in about twenty-five
large volumes the most important works of the Greek Fathers from
Eusebius to Photius, and of the Latin Fathers from Ambrose to Gregory
the Great.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>The series opens with St. Augustin, the greatest
and most influential of all the Christian Fathers. Protestants and
Catholics are equally interested in his writings, and most of all in his
*Confessions*, which are contained in this volume. They will be followed
by the works of St. Chrysostom, and the Church History of Eusebius.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>A few words are necessary to define the object
of this Library, and its relation to similar collections.

<span id="ii-p6"></span>My purpose is to furnish ministers and
intelligent laymen who have no access to the original texts, or are not
sufficiently familiar with ecclesiastical Greek and Latin, with a
complete apparatus for the study of ancient Christianity. Whatever may
be the estimate we put upon the opinions of the Fathers, their
historical value is beyond all dispute. They are to this day and will
continue to be the chief authorities for the doctrines and usages of the
Greek and Roman Churches, and the sources for the knowledge of ancient
Christianity down to the age of Charlemagne. But very few can afford to
buy, or are able to use such collections as Migne’s Greek Patrology,
which embraces 167 quarto volumes, and Migne’s Latin Patrology which
embraces 222 volumes.

<span id="ii-p7"></span>The three leaders of the now historic
Anglo-Catholic movement of Oxford, Drs. <span class="c9"><span
id="ii-p7.1"></span>Pusey, Newman</span>, and <span class="c9"><span
id="ii-p7.2"></span>Keble</span>, began, in 1837, the publication of “*A
Library of Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church, anterior to the Division
of the East and West. Translated by Members of the English Church*,”
Oxford (John Henry Parker) and London (J. G. F. & J. Rivington). It is
dedicated to “William Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all
England.” The editors were aided by a number of able classical and
ecclesiastical scholars. Dr. Pusey, the chief editor and proprietor, and
Dr. Keble died in the communion of the church of their fathers to which
they were loyally attached; Dr. Newman alone remains, though no more an
Anglican, but a Cardinal of the Church of Rome. His connection with the
enterprise ceased with his secession (1845).

<span id="ii-p8"></span>The Oxford Library was undertaken not so much
for an historical, as for an apologetic and dogmatic purpose. It was to
furnish authentic proof for the supposed or real agreement of the
Anglo-Catholic school with the faith and practice of the ancient church
before the Greek schism. The selection was made accordingly. The series
embraces 48 vols. It is very valuable as far as it <span id="page_vi">p.
vi</span> <span id="ii-Page_vi"></span>goes, but incomplete and unequal.
Volume followed volume as it happened to get ready. An undue proportion
is given to exegetical works; six volumes are taken up with Augustin’s
Commentary on the Psalms, six with Gregory’s Commentary on Job, sixteen
with Commentaries of Chrysostom; while many of the most important
doctrinal, ethical, and historical works of the Fathers, as Eusebius,
Basil, the two Gregorys, Theodoret, Maximus Confessor, John of Damascus,
Hilary, Jerome, Leo the Great, were never reached.

<span id="ii-p9"></span>In 1866, Mr. T. Clark, Lord Provost of
Edinburgh, and an Elder in the Free Church of Scotland, who has done
more than any publisher for the introduction of German and other foreign
theological literature to the English reading community, began to issue
the valuable “*Ante-Nicene Christian Library*”, edited by Rev. <span
class="c9"><span id="ii-p9.1"></span>Alexander Roberts</span>, D. D.,
and <span class="c9"><span id="ii-p9.2"></span>James Donaldson</span>,
LL. D., which was completed in 1872 in 24 volumes, and is now being
republished, by arrangement with Mr. Clark, in America in 8 volumes
under the editorship of Bishop A. <span class="c9"><span
id="ii-p9.3"></span>Cleveland Coxe</span>, D. D. (1884–1886). Mr. Clark,
in 1871, undertook also the publication of a translation of select works
of St. <span class="c9"><span id="ii-p9.4"></span>Augustin</span> under
the editorial care of Rev. <span class="c9"><span
id="ii-p9.5"></span>Marcus Dods</span>, D. D., of Glasgow, which was
completed in 15 volumes. The projected translation of <span
class="c9"><span id="ii-p9.6"></span>Chrysostom</span> was abandoned
from want of encouragement.

<span id="ii-p10"></span>Thus Episcopal divines of England, and
Presbyterian divines of Scotland have prepared the way for our American
enterprise, and made it possible.

<span id="ii-p11"></span>We must also briefly mention a similar
collection which was prepared by Roman Catholic scholars of Germany in
the interest of their Church, namely the *Bibliothek der Kirchenväter.
Auswahl der vorzüglichsten patristichen Werke in deutscher Uebersetzung,
herausgegeben unter der Oberleitung von Dr. Valentin Thalhofer*
(*Domdekan und Prof. der Theol. in Eichstätt*, formerly Professor in
Munich). Kempten., Köselsche Buchhandlung. 1869–1886. Published in over
400 small numbers, three or four of which make a volume. An alphabetical
Index vol. is now in course of preparation by Ulrich Uhle (Nos. 405
sqq.). The series was begun in 1869 by Dr. Fr. X. Reithmayr, Prof. of
Theol. in Munich, who died in 1872. It embraces select writings of most
of the Fathers. Seven volumes are devoted to Letters of the Popes from
Linus to Pelagius II. (<span class="c9"><span
id="ii-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span> 67–590).

<span id="ii-p12"></span>“The Christian Literature Company,” who
republish Clark’s “Ante-Nicene Library,” asked me to undertake the
editorship of a Nicene and Post-Nicene Library to complete the scheme.
Satisfactory arrangements have been made with Mr. Clark and with Mr.
Walter Smith, representing Dr. Pusey’s heirs, for the use of their
translations, as far as our plan will permit. Without such a preliminary
arrangement I would not have considered the proposal for a moment.

<span id="ii-p13"></span>I have invited surviving authors of older
translations to revise and edit their work for the American series, and
I am happy to state that I received favorable replies. Some of them are
among the list of contributors, others (including Cardinal Newman) have,
at least, expressed a kindly interest in the enterprise, and wish it
success.

<span id="ii-p14"></span>The Nicene and Post-Nicene Library will be more
complete and more systematic as well as much cheaper than any which has
yet appeared in the English language. By omitting the voluminous
Patristic commentaries on the Old Testament we shall gain room for more
important and interesting works not embraced in the Oxford or Edinburgh
series; and by condensing three or more of these volumes into one, and
counting upon a large number of subscribers, the publishers <span
id="page_vii">p. vii</span> <span id="ii-Page_vii"></span>think
themselves justified in offering the Library on terms which are
exceedingly liberal, considering the great expense and risk. It will be
published in the same handsome style as their Ante-Nicene Library.

<span id="ii-p15"></span>May the blessing of the Great Head of the
Church accompany and crown this work.
