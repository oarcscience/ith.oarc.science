<span id="vii.1.CXXIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CXXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXXIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXXIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 410.)

<span id="vii.1.CXXIII-p3"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXXIII-p3.1"></span>From Jerome to Augustin.</span>\]

<span id="vii.1.CXXIII-p4"></span>There are many who go halting upon
both feet, and refuse to bend their heads even when their necks are
broken, persisting in adherence to their former errors, even though they
have not their former liberty of proclaiming them.

<span id="vii.1.CXXIII-p5"></span>Respectful salutations are sent to you
by the holy brethren who are with your humble servant, and especially by
your pious and venerable daughters. <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) I beg your Excellency to salute in
my name your brethren my lord Alypius and my lord Evodius. Jerusalem is
held captive by Nebuchadnezzar, and refuses to listen to the counsels of
Jeremiah, preferring to look wistfully towards Egypt, that it may die in
Tahpanhes, and perish there in eternal bondage. <span

of Bethlehem.

<span id="vii.1.CXXIII-p7"></span> Two opinions have been advanced as to
the signification of this enigmatical allusion to the events recorded in
[Jer. 43](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#000.md)<span
id="vii.1.CXXIII-p7.1"></span>. Some think that Jerome refers to Rome,
then occupied by the Goths. Others find here a reference to the state of
the Church at Jerusalem at the time; perhaps under the name of
Nebuchadnezzar some heretical bishop is designed.
