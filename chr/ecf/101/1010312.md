<span id="vii.1.V-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.1.V-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.V-p3.1"></span>To Augustin Nebridius Sends Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.V-p4"></span>Is it true, my beloved Augustin, that you
are spending your strength and patience on the affairs of your
fellow-citizens (in Thagaste), and that the leisure from distractions
which you so earnestly desired is still withheld from you? Who, I would
like to know, are the men who thus take advantage of your good nature,
and trespass on your time? I believe that they do not know what you love
most and long for. Have you no friend at hand to tell them what your
heart is set upon? Will neither Romanianus nor Lucinianus do this? Let
them hear me at all events. I will proclaim aloud; I will protest that
God is the supreme object of your love, and that your heart’s desire is
to be His servant, and to cleave to Him. Fain would I persuade you to
come to my home in the country, and rest here; I shall not be afraid of
being denounced as a robber by those countrymen of yours, whom you love
only too well, and by whom you are too warmly loved in return.
