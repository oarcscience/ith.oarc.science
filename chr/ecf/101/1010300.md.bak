<span id="vi.XIII.XXXIV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXXIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—He Briefly Repeats the
Allegorical Interpretation of Genesis (Ch. I.), and Confesses that We
See It by the Divine Spirit.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXIV-p2"></span>49. We have also examined what Thou
willedst to be shadowed forth, whether by the creation, or the
description of things in such an order. And we have seen that things
severally are good, and all things very good, <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) in Thy Word, in Thine
Only-Begotten, both heaven and earth, the Head and the body of the
Church, in Thy predestination before all times, without morning and
evening. But when Thou didst begin to execute in time the things
predestinated, that Thou mightest make manifest things hidden, and
adjust our disorders (for our sins were over us, and we had sunk into
profound darkness away from thee, and Thy good Spirit was borne over us
to help us in due season), Thou didst both justify the ungodly, <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) and didst divide them from the
wicked; and madest firm the authority of Thy Book between those above,
who would be docile unto Thee, and those under, who would be subject
unto them; and Thou didst collect the society of unbelievers into one
conspiracy, in order that the zeal of the faithful might appear, and
that they might bring forth works of mercy unto Thee, even distributing
unto the poor earthly riches, to obtain heavenly. And after this didst
Thou kindle certain lights in the firmament, Thy holy ones, having the
word of life, and shining with an eminent authority preferred by
spiritual gifts; and then again, for the instruction of the unbelieving
Gentiles, didst Thou out of corporeal matter produce the sacraments and
visible miracles, and sounds of words according to the firmament of Thy
Book, by which the faithful should be blessed. Next didst Thou form the
living soul of the faithful, through affections ordered by the vigour of
continency; and afterwards, the mind <span id="page_207">p. 207</span>
<span id="vi.XIII.XXXIV-Page_207"></span>subjected to Thee alone, and
needing to imitate no human authority, <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) Thou didst renew after Thine image
and likeness; and didst subject its rational action to the excellency of
the understanding, as the woman to the man; and to all Thy ministries,
necessary for the perfecting of the faithful in this life, Thou didst
will that, for their temporal uses, good things, fruitful in the future
time, should be given by the same faithful. <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) We behold all these things, and
they are very good, because Thou dost see them in us,—Thou who hast
given unto us Thy Spirit, whereby we might see them, and in them love
Thee.

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXIV-p6"></span> “The peace of heaven,” says Augustin
in his *De Civ. Dei*, xix. 17, “alone can be truly called and esteemed
the peace of the reasonable creatures, consisting as it does in the
perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of God, and of one another in
God. When we shall have reached that peace, this mortal life shall give
place to one that is eternal, and our body shall be no more this animal
body which by its corruption weighs down the soul, but a spiritual body
feeling no want, and in all its members subjected to the will.” See p.
111, note 8 (end), above.
