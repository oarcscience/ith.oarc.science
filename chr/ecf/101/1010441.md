id="vii.1.CLXV-p6.1"></span>Chap. I.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXV-p7"></span>1. At last I have received your joint
letter from Africa, and I do not regret the importunity with which,
though you were silent, I persevered in sending letters to you, that I
might obtain a reply, and learn, not through report from others, but
from your own most welcome statement, that you are in health. I have not
forgotten the brief query, or rather the very important
theological <span id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704) question, which
you propounded in regard to the origin of the soul,—does it descend from
heaven, as the philosopher Pythagoras and all the Platonists and Origen
think? or is it part of the essence of the Deity, as the Stoics,
Manichæus, and the Priscillianists of Spain imagine? or are souls kept
in a divine treasure house wherein they were stored of old as some
ecclesiastics, foolishly misled, believe? or are they daily created by
God and sent into bodies, according to what is written in the gospel,
“My Father worketh hitherto, and I work”? <span
id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705) or are souls really produced, as
Tertullian, Apollinaris, and the majority of the Western divines
conjecture, by propagation, so that as the body is the offspring of
body, the soul is the offspring of soul, and exists on conditions
similar to those regulating the existence of the inferior
animals.” <span id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706) I know that I have
published my opinion on this question in my brief writings against
Ruffinus, in reply to a treatise addressed by him to Anastasius, of holy
memory, bishop of the Roman Church, in which, while attempting to impose
upon the simplicity of his readers by a slippery and artful, yet withal
foolish confession, he exposed to contempt his own faith, or, rather,
his own perfidy. These books are, I think, in the possession of your
holy kinsman Oceanus, for they were published long ago to meet the
calumnies contained in numerous writings of Ruffinus. Be this as it may,
you have in Africa that holy man and learned bishop Augustin, who will
be able to teach you on this subject *viva voce*, as the saying is, and
expound to you his opinion, or, I should rather say, my own opinion
stated in his words.

<span id="vii.1.CLXV-p11"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXV-p11.1"></span>Chap. II.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXV-p12"></span>2. I have long wished to begin the
volume of Ezekiel, and fulfil a promise frequently made to studious
readers; but at the time when I had just begun to dictate the proposed
exposition, my mind was so much agitated by the devastation of the
western provinces of the empire, and especially by the sack of Rome
itself by the barbarians, that, to use a common proverbial phrase, I
scarcely knew my own name; and for a long while I was silent, knowing
that it was a time for tears. Moreover when I had, in the course of this
year, prepared three books of the *Commentary*, a sudden furious
invasion of the barbarous tribes mentioned by your Virgil as “the widely
roaming Barcæi,” <span id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707) and by
sacred Scripture in the words concerning Ishmael, “He shall dwell in the
presence of his brethren,” <span id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708)
swept over the whole of Egypt, Palestine, Phenice, and Syria, carrying
all before them with the vehemence of a mighty torrent, so that it was
only with the greatest difficulty that we were enabled, by the mercy of
Christ, to escape their hands. But if, as a famous orator has said,
“Laws are silent amid the clash of arms,” <span
id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709) how much more may this be said of
scriptural studies, which demand a multitude of books and silence,
together with uninterrupted diligence of amanuenses, and especially the
enjoyment of tranquillity and leisure by those who dictate! I have
accordingly sent two books to my holy daughter Fabiola, of which, if you
wish copies, you may borrow them from her. Through lack of time I have
been unable to transcribe others; when you have read these, and have
seen the portico, as it were, you may easily conjecture what the house
itself is designed to be. But I trust in the mercy of God, who has
helped me in the very difficult commencement of the foresaid work, that
He will help me also in the predictions concerning the wars of Gog and
Magog, which occupy the last division but one of the prophecy, <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710) and in the concluding portion
itself, describing the building, the details, and the proportions of
that most holy and mysterious temple. <span
id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711)

<span id="vii.1.CLXV-p18"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CLXV-p18.1"></span>Chap. III.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CLXV-p19"></span>3. Our holy brother Oceanus, to whom
you desire to be mentioned, is a man of such gifts and character, and so
profoundly learned in the law of the Lord, that he may probably give you
instruction without any request of mine, and can impart to you on all
scriptural questions the opinion which, according to the measure of our
joint abilities, we have formed.

<span id="vii.1.CLXV-p20"></span>May Christ, our almighty God, keep you,
my truly pious lords, in safety and prosperity to a good old age!
