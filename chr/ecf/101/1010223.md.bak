id="vi.XI.XXII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—He Prays God that He Would
Explain This Most Entangled Enigma.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XXII-p2"></span>28. My soul yearns to know this most
entangled enigma. Forbear to shut up, O Lord my God, good
Father,—through Christ I beseech Thee,—forbear to shut up these things,
both usual and hidden, from my desire, that it may be hindered from
penetrating them; but let them dawn through Thy enlightening mercy, O
Lord. Of whom shall I inquire concerning these things? And to whom shall
I with more advantage confess my ignorance than to Thee, to whom these
my studies, so vehemently kindled towards Thy Scriptures, are not
troublesome? Give that which I love; for I do love, and this hast Thou
given me. Give, Father, who truly knowest to give good gifts unto Thy
children. <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) Give, since I have
undertaken to know, and trouble is before me until Thou dost open
it. <span id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) Through Christ, I beseech
Thee, in His name, Holy of Holies, let no man interrupt me. For I
believed, and therefore do I speak. <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) This is my hope; for this do I
live, that I may contemplate the delights of the Lord. <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) Behold, Thou hast made my days
old, <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md) and they pass away, and
<span id="page_171">p. 171</span> <span
id="vi.XI.XXII-Page_171"></span>in what manner I know not. And we speak
as to time and time, times and times,—“How long is the time since he
said this?” “How long the time since he did this?” and, “How long the
time since I saw that?” and, “This syllable hath double the time of that
single short syllable.” These words we speak, and these we hear; and we
are understood, and we understand. They are most manifest and most
usual, and the same things again lie hid too deeply, and the discovery
of them is new.
