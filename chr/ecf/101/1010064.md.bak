id="vi.IV.V-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Why Weeping is Pleasant to the
Wretched.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.V-p2"></span>10. And now, O Lord, these things are
passed away, and time hath healed my wound. May I learn from Thee, who
art Truth, and apply the ear of my heart unto Thy mouth, that Thou
mayest tell me why weeping should be so sweet to the unhappy. <span
id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) Hast Thou—although present
everywhere—cast away far from Thee our misery? And Thou abidest in
Thyself, but we are disquieted with divers trials; and yet, unless we
wept in Thine ears, there would be no hope for us remaining. Whence,
then, is it that such sweet fruit is plucked from the bitterness of
life, from groans, tears, sighs, and lamentations? Is it the hope that
Thou hearest us that sweetens it? This is true of prayer, for therein is
a desire to approach unto Thee. But is it also in grief for a thing
lost, and the sorrow with which I was then overwhelmed? For I had
neither hope of his coming to life again, nor did I seek this with my
tears; but I grieved and wept only, for I was miserable, and had lost my
joy. Or is weeping a bitter thing, and for distaste of the things which
aforetime we enjoyed before, and even then, when we are loathing them,
does it cause us pleasure?
