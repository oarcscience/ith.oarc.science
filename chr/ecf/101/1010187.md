<span id="vi.X.XXX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XXX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Of the Perverse Images of Dreams,
Which He Wishes to Have Taken Away.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXX-p2"></span>41. Verily, Thou commandest that I should
be continent from the “lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and
the pride of life.” <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) Thou hast
commanded me to abstain from concubinage; and as to marriage itself,
Thou hast advised something better than Thou hast allowed. And because
Thou didst give it, it was done; and that before I became a dispenser of
Thy sacrament. But there still exist in my memory—of which I have spoken
much—the images of such things as my habits had fixed there; and these
rush into my thoughts, though strengthless, when I am awake; but in
sleep they do so not only so as to give pleasure, but even to obtain
consent, and what very nearly resembles reality. <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) Yea, to such an extent prevails the
illusion of the image, both in my soul and in my flesh, that the false
persuade me, <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="vi.X.XXX-Page_154"></span>when sleeping, unto that which the true
are not able when waking. Am I not myself at that time, O Lord my God?
And there is yet so much difference between myself and myself, in that
instant wherein I pass back from waking to sleeping, or return from
sleeping to waking! Where, then, is the reason which when waking resists
such suggestions? And if the things themselves be forced on it, I remain
unmoved. Is it shut up with the eyes? Or is it put to sleep with the
bodily senses? But whence, then, comes it to pass, that even in slumber
we often resist, and, bearing our purpose in mind, and continuing most
chastely in it, yield no assent to such allurements? And there is yet so
much difference that, when it happeneth otherwise, upon awaking we
return to peace of conscience; and by this same diversity do we discover
that it was not we that did it, while we still feel sorry that in some
way it was done in us.

<span id="vi.X.XXX-p5"></span>42. Is not Thy hand able, O Almighty God,
to heal all the diseases of my soul, <span
id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md) and by Thy more abundant grace to
quench even the lascivious motions of my sleep? Thou wilt increase in
me, O Lord, Thy gifts more and more, that my soul may follow me to Thee,
disengaged from the bird-lime of concupiscence; that it may not be in
rebellion against itself, and even in dreams not simply not, through
sensual images, commit those deformities of corruption, even to the
pollution of the flesh, but that it may not even consent unto them. For
it is no great thing for the Almighty, who is “able to do . . . above
all that we ask or think,” <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882.md) to
bring it about that no such influence—not even so slight a one as a sign
might restrain—should afford gratification to the chaste affection even
of one sleeping; and that not only in this life, but at my present age.
But what I still am in this species of my ill, have I confessed unto my
good Lord; rejoicing with trembling <span
id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md) in that which Thou hast given me, and
bewailing myself for that wherein I am still imperfect; trusting that
Thou wilt perfect Thy mercies in me, even to the fulness of peace, which
both that which is within and that which is without <span
id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md) shall have with Thee, when death is
swallowed up in victory. <span id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md)

Dilating on [Ps. 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#000.md)<span

correspond to the threefold nature of our Lord’s temptation in the
wilderness. See also p. 80, note 5, above.

<span id="vi.X.XXX-p4"></span> In Augustin’s view, then, dreams appear
to result from our thoughts and feelings when awake. In this he has the
support of Aristotle (*Ethics*, i. 13), as also that of Solomon, who
says ([Eccles. 5.3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.X.XXX-p4.1"></span>), “A dream cometh through the multitude of
business.” An apt illustration of this is found in the life of the great
Danish sculptor, Thorwaldsen. It is said that he could not satisfy
himself with his models for *The Christ*, in the Frauenkirche at
Copenhagen,—as Da Vinci before him was *never* able to paint the face of
the Christ in His noble fresco of the Last Supper,—and that it was only
in consequence of a dream (that dream doubtless the result of his
stedfast search for an ideal) that this great work was accomplished. But
see *Ep.* clix.
