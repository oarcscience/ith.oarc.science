id="vi.XI.VI-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—He Did Not, However, Create It by
a Sounding and Passing Word.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.VI-p2"></span>8. But how didst Thou speak? Was it in
that manner in which the voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my
beloved Son”? <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) For that voice
was uttered and passed away, began and ended. The syllables sounded and
passed by, the second after the first, the third after the second, and
thence in order, until the last after the rest, and silence after the
last. Hence it is clear and plain that the motion of a creature
expressed it, itself temporal, obeying Thy Eternal will. And these thy
words formed at the time, the outer ear conveyed to the intel<span

mind, whose inner ear lay attentive to Thy eternal word. But it compared
these words sounding in time with Thy eternal word in silence, and said,
“It is different, very different. These words are far beneath me, nor
are they, since they flee and pass away; but the Word of my Lord
remaineth above me for ever.” If, then, in sounding and fleeting words
Thou didst say that heaven and earth should be made, and didst thus make
heaven and earth, there was already a corporeal creature before heaven
and earth by whose temporal motions that voice might take its course in
time. But there was nothing corporeal before heaven and earth; or if
there were, certainly Thou without a transitory voice hadst created that
whence Thou wouldest make the passing voice, by which to say that the
heaven and the earth should be made. For whatsoever that were of which
such a voice was made, unless it were made by Thee, it could not be at
all. By what word of Thine was it decreed that a body might be made,
whereby these words might be made?
