<span id="vi.IX.IV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IX.IV-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—In the Country He Gives His
Attention to Literature, and Explains the Fourth Psalm in Connection
with the Happy Conversion of Alypius. He is Troubled with
Toothache.</span>

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p2"></span>7. And the day arrived on which, in very
deed, I was to be released from the Professorship of Rhetoric, from
which in intention I had been already released. And done it was; and
Thou didst deliver my tongue whence Thou hadst already delivered my
heart; and full of joy I blessed Thee for it, and retired with all mine
to the villa. <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) What I
accomplished here in writing, which was now wholly devoted to Thy
service, though still, in this pause as it were, panting from the school
of pride, my books testify, <span id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md)
—those in which I disputed with my friends, and those with myself
alone <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) before Thee; and what with
the absent Nebridius, my letters <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md)
testify. And when can I find time to recount all Thy great benefits
which Thou bestowedst upon us at that time, especially as I am hasting
on to still greater mercies? For my memory calls upon me, and pleasant
it is to me, O Lord, to confess unto Thee, by what inward goads Thou
didst subdue me, and how Thou didst make me low, bringing down the
mountains and hills of my imaginations, and didst straighten my
crookedness, and smooth my rough ways; <span
id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) and by what means Thou also didst
subdue that brother of my heart, Alypius, unto the name of Thy
only-begotten, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which he at first
refused to have inserted in our writings. For he rather desired that
they should savour of the “cedars” of the schools, which the Lord hath
now broken down, <span id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) than of the
wholesome herbs of the Church, hostile to serpents.

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p9"></span>8. What utterances sent I up unto Thee, my
God, when I read the Psalms of David, <span
id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) those faithful songs and sounds of
devotion which exclude all swelling of spirit, when new to Thy true
love, at rest in the villa with Alypius, a catechumen like myself, my
mother cleaving unto us,—in woman’s garb truly, but with a man’s faith,
with the peacefulness of age, full of motherly love and Christian piety!
What utterances used I to send up unto Thee in those Psalms, and how was
I inflamed towards Thee by them, and burned to rehearse them, if it
<span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span
id="vi.IX.IV-Page_132"></span>were possible, throughout the whole world,
against the pride of the human race! And yet they are sung throughout
the whole world, and none can hide himself from Thy heat. <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) With what vehement and bitter sorrow
was I indignant at the Manichæans; whom yet again I pitied, for that
they were ignorant of those sacraments, those medicaments, and were mad
against the antidote which might have made them sane! I wished that they
had been somewhere near me then, and, without my being aware of their
presence, could have beheld my face, and heard my words, when I read the
fourth Psalm in that time of my leisure,—how that Psalm wrought upon me.
When I called upon Thee, Thou didst hear me, O God of my righteousness;
Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and
hear my prayer. <span id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) Oh that they
might have heard what I uttered on these words, without my knowing
whether they heard or no, lest they should think that I spake it because
of them! For, of a truth, neither should I have said the same things,
nor in the way I said them, if I had perceived that I was heard and seen
by them; and had I spoken them, they would not so have received them as
when I spake by and for myself before Thee, out of the private feelings
of my soul.

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p13"></span>9. I alternately quaked with fear, and
warmed with hope, and with rejoicing in Thy mercy, O Father. And all
these passed forth, both by mine eyes and voice, when Thy good Spirit,
turning unto us, said, O ye sons of men, how long will ye be slow of
heart? “How long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?” <span
id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) For I had loved vanity, and sought
after leasing. And Thou, O Lord, hadst already magnified Thy Holy One,
raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at Thy right hand, <span
id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) whence from on high He should send His
promise, <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md) the Paraclete, “the
Spirit of Truth.” <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) And He had
already sent Him, <span id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) but I knew it
not; He had sent Him, because He was now magnified, rising again from
the dead, and ascending into heaven. For till then “the Holy Ghost was
not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.” <span
id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) And the prophet cries out, How long
will ye be slow of heart? How long will ye love vanity, and seek after
leasing? Know this, that the Lord hath magnified His Holy One. He cries
out, “How long?” He cries out, “Know this,” and I, so long ignorant,
“loved vanity, and sought after leasing.” And therefore I heard and
trembled, because these words were spoken unto such as I remembered that
I myself had been. For in those phantasms which I once held for truths
was there “vanity” and “leasing.” And I spake many things loudly and
earnestly, in the sorrow of my remembrance, which, would that they who
yet “love vanity and seek after leasing” had heard! They would perchance
have been troubled, and have vomited it forth, and Thou wouldest hear
them when they cried unto Thee; <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md)
for by a true <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) death in the flesh
He died for us, who now maketh intercession for us <span
id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) with Thee.

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p23"></span>10. I read further, “Be ye angry, and sin
not.” <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md) And how was I moved, O my
God, who had now learned to “be angry” with myself for the things past,
so that in the future I might not sin! Yea, to be justly angry; for that
it was not another nature of the race of darkness <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) which sinned for me, as they affirm it
to be who are not angry with themselves, and who treasure up to
themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and of the revelation of Thy
righteous judgment. <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) Nor were my
good things <span id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) now without, nor
were they sought after with eyes of flesh in that sun; <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) for they that would have joy from
without easily sink into oblivion, and are wasted upon those things
which are seen and temporal, and in their starving thoughts do lick
their very shadows. Oh, if only they were wearied out with their
fasting, and said, “Who will show us any good?” <span
id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) And we would answer, and they hear, O
Lord. The light of Thy countenance is lifted up upon us. <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md) For we are not that Light, which
lighteth every man, <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) but we are
enlightened by Thee, that we, who were sometimes darkness, may be light
in Thee. <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) Oh that they could
behold the internal Eternal, <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md)
which having tasted I gnashed my teeth that I could not show It to them,
while they brought me their heart in their eyes, roaming abroad from
Thee, and said, “Who will show us any good?” But there, where I was
angry with myself in my chamber, where I was inwardly pricked, where I
had offered my “sacrifice,” slaying my old man, and beginning the
resolution of a new life, putting my trust in Thee, <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) —there hadst Thou begun to grow sweet
unto me, and to “put gladness in <span id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="vi.IX.IV-Page_133"></span>my heart.” <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) And I cried out as I read this
outwardly, and felt it inwardly. Nor would I be increased <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) with worldly goods, wasting time and
being wasted by time; whereas I possessed in Thy eternal simplicity
other corn, and wine, and oil. <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md)

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p38"></span>11. And with a loud cry from my heart, I
called out in the following verse, “Oh, in peace!” and “the
self-same!” <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) Oh, what said he, “I
will lay me down and sleep!” <span id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) For
who shall hinder us, when “shall be brought to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory?” <span
id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) And Thou art in the highest degree
“the self-same,” who changest not; and in Thee is the rest which
forgetteth all labour, for there is no other beside Thee, nor ought we
to seek after those many other things which are not what Thou art; but
Thou, Lord, only makest me to dwell in hope. <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) These things I read, and was inflamed;
but discovered not what to do with those deaf and dead, of whom I had
been a pestilent member,—a bitter and a blind declaimer against the
writings be-honied with the honey of heaven and luminous with Thine own
light; and I was consumed on account of the enemies of this Scripture.

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p43"></span>12. When shall I call to mind all that
took place in those holidays? Yet neither have I forgotten, nor will I
be silent about the severity of Thy scourge, and the amazing quickness
of Thy mercy. <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) Thou didst at that
time torture me with toothache; <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md)
and when it had become so exceeding great that I was not able to speak,
it came into my heart to urge all my friends who were present to pray
for me to Thee, the God of all manner of health. And I wrote it down on
wax, <span id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) and gave it to them to
read. Presently, as with submissive desire we bowed our knees, that pain
departed. But what pain? Or how did it depart? I confess to being much
afraid, my Lord my God, seeing that from my earliest years I had not
experienced such pain. And Thy purposes were profoundly impressed upon
me; and, rejoicing in faith, I praised Thy name. And that faith suffered
me not to be at rest in regard to my past sins, which were not yet
forgiven me by Thy baptism.

id="vi.IX.IV-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p3"></span> As Christ went into the wilderness after
His baptism ([Matt. 4.1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.IX.IV-p3.1"></span>), and Paul into Arabia after his conversion
([Gal. 1.17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.IX.IV-p3.2"></span>), so did Augustin here find in his retirement
a preparation for his future work. He tells us of this time of his life
(*De Ordin*. i. 6) that his habit was to spend the beginning or end, and
often almost half the night, in watching and searching for truth, and
says further (*ibid.* 29), that “he almost daily asked God with tears
that his wounds might be healed, and often proved to himself that he was
unworthy to be healed as soon as he wished.”

<span id="fn_712"></span>[131:713](1010147.htm#fr_712.md) <span
id="vi.IX.IV-p3.3"></span>

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p4"></span> These books are (*Con. Acad.* i. 4) his
three disputations *Against the Academics*, his *De Vita Beata*, begun
(*ibid*. 6) “Idibus Novembris die ejus natali;” and (*Retract.* i. 3)
his two books *De Ordine.*

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p5"></span> That is, his two books of *Soliloquies*.
In his *Retractations*, i. 4, sec 1, he tells us that in these books he
held an argument,—*me interrogans, mihique respondens, tanquam duo
essemus, ratio et ego.*

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p10"></span> Reference may with advantage be made to
Archbishop Trench’s *Hulsean Lectures* (1845), who in his third lect.,
on “The Manifoldness of Scripture,” adverts to this very passage, and
shows in an interesting way how the Psalms have ever been to the saints
of God, as Luther said, “a Bible in little,” affording satisfaction to
their needs in every kind of trial, emergency, and experience.

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p36"></span> That is, lest they should distract him
from the true riches. For, as he says in his exposition of the fourth
Psalm, “Cum dedita temporalibus voluptatibus anima semper exardescit
cupiditate, nec satiari potest.” He knew that the prosperity of the soul
([3 John 2](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.IX.IV-p36.1"></span>) might be injuriously affected by the
prosperity of the body; and disregarding the lower life (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.IX.IV-p36.2"></span>βίος</span>) and its
“worldly goods,” he pressed on to increase the treasure he had
within,—the true life (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.IX.IV-p36.3"></span>ζωή</span>) which he had received from God.

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p44"></span> Compare the beautiful Talmudical legend
quoted by Jeremy Taylor (*Works*, viii. 397, Eden’s ed.), that of the
two archangels, Gabriel and Michael, Gabriel has two wings that he may
“fly swiftly” ([Dan. 9.21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.IX.IV-p44.1"></span>) to bring the message of peace, while
Michael has but one, that he may labour in his flight when he comes
forth on his ministries of justice.

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p45"></span> In his *Soliloquies* (see note, sec. 7,
above), he refers in i. 21 to this period. He there tells us that his
pain was so great that it prevented his learning anything afresh, and
only permitted him to revolve in his mind what he had already learnt.
Compare De Quincey’s description of the agonies he had to endure from
tooth ache in his *Confessions of an Opium Eater*.

<span id="vi.IX.IV-p46"></span> That is, on the waxen tablet used by the
ancients. The iron *stilus*, or pencil, used for writing, was pointed at
one end and flattened at the other—the flattened circular end being used
to erase the writing by smoothing down the wax. Hence *vertere stilum*
signifies *to put out* or *correct*. See sec. 19, below.
