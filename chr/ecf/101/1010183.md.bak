Who Take Counsel of Him.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXVI-p2"></span>37. Where, then, did I find Thee, so as
to be able to learn Thee? For Thou wert not in my memory before I
learned Thee. Where, then, did I find Thee, so as to be able to learn
Thee, but in Thee above me? Place there is none; we go both “backward”
and “forward,” <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) and there is no
place. Everywhere, O Truth, dost Thou direct all who consult Thee, and
dost at once answer all, though they consult Thee on divers things.
Clearly dost Thou answer, though all do not with clearness hear. All
consult Thee upon whatever they wish, though they hear not always that
which they wish. He is Thy best servant who does not so much look to
hear that from Thee which he himself wisheth, as to wish that which he
heareth from Thee.
