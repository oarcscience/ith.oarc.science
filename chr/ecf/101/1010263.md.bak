<span id="vi.XII.XXX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XXX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—In the Great Diversity of
Opinions, It Becomes All to Unite Charity and Divine Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XXX-p2"></span>41. In this diversity of true opinions
let Truth itself beget concord; <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md) and may our God have mercy upon us,
that we may use the law lawfully, <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) the end of the commandment, pure
charity. <span id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md) And by this if any
one asks of me, “Which of these was the meaning of Thy servant Moses?”
these were not the utterances of my confessions, should I not confess
unto Thee, “I know not;” and yet I know that those opinions are true,
with the exception of those carnal ones concerning which I have spoken
what I thought well. However, these words of Thy Book affright not those
little ones of good hope, treating few of high things in a humble
fashion, and few things in varied ways. <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md) But let all, whom I acknowledge to
see and speak the truth in these words, love one another, and equally
love Thee, our God, fountain of truth,—if we thirst not for vain things,
but for it; yea, let us so honour this servant of Thine, the dispenser
of this Scripture, full of Thy Spirit, as to believe that when Thou
revealedst Thyself to him, and he wrote these things, he intended that
which in them chiefly excels both for light of truth and fruitfulness of
profit.

<span id="vi.XII.XXX-p5"></span> See p. 183, note, above; and on the
supremacy of this law of love, may be compared Jeremy Taylor’s curious
story (Works, iv. 477, Eden’s ed.): “St. Lewis, the king, having sent
Ivo, Bishop of Chartres, on an embassy, the bishop met a woman on the
way, grave, sad, fantastic, and melancholy, with fire in one hand, and
water in the other. He asked what those symbols meant. She answered, ‘My
purpose is with fire to burn Paradise, and with my water to quench the
flames of hell, that men may serve God without the incentives of hope
and fear, and purely for the love of God.’”
