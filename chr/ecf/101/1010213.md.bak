id="vi.XI.XII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—What God Did Before the Creation
of the World.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XII-p2"></span>14. Behold, I answer to him who asks,
“What was God doing before He made heaven and earth?” I answer not, as a
certain person is reported to have done facetiously (avoiding the
pressure of the question), “He was preparing hell,” saith he, “for those
who pry into mysteries.” It is one thing to perceive, another to
laugh,—these things I answer not. For more willingly would I have
answered, “I know not what I know not,” than that I should make him a
laughing-stock who asketh deep things, and gain praise as one who
answereth false things. But I say that Thou, our God, art the Creator of
every creature; and if by the term “heaven and earth” every creature is
understood, I boldly say, “That before God made heaven and earth, He
made not anything. For if He did, what did He make unless the creature?”
And would that I knew whatever I desire to know to my advantage, as I
know that no creature was made before any creature was made.
