<span id="vii.1.L-p3"></span>(<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.1.L-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.L-p4.1"></span>To the Magistrates and Leading Men, or Elders,
of the Colony of Suffectum, Bishop Augustin Sends Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.L-p5"></span>Earth reels and heaven trembles at the
report of the enormous crime and unprecedented cruelty which has made
your streets and temples run red with blood, and ring with the shouts of
murderers. You have buried the laws of Rome in a dishonoured grave, and
trampled in scorn the reverence due to equitable enactments. The
authority of emperors you neither respect nor fear. In your city there
has been shed the innocent blood of sixty of our brethren; and whoever
approved himself most active in the massacre, was rewarded with your
applause, and with a high place in your Council. Come now, let us arrive
at the chief pretext for this outrage. If you say that Hercules belonged
to you, by all means we will make good your loss: we have metals at
hand, and there is no lack of stone; nay, we have several varieties of
marble, and a host of artisans. Fear not, your god is in the hands of
his makers, and shall be with all diligence hewn out and polished and
ornamented. We will give in addition some red ochre, to make him blush
in such a way as may well harmonize with your devotions. Or if you say
that the Hercules must be of your own making, we will raise a
subscription in pennies, <span id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697.md) and
buy a god from a workman of your own for you. Only do you at the same
time make restitution to us; and as your god Hercules is given back to
you, let the lives of the many men whom your violence has destroyed be
given back to us.

<span id="vii.1.L-p2"></span> This letter is found only in the Vatican
<span class="c9"><span id="vii.1.L-p2.1"></span>Ms.</span> On this
ground, and because of its tone and style, its composition has been
ascribed to another hand than Augustin’s. The reader may judge for
himself. The sixty Christians of Suffectum (a town in the territory of
Tunis), whose death is here mentioned, are commemorated in the
martyrology of the Roman Catholic Church. Their day in the Calendar is
Aug. 30.
