<span id="vi.IV.XI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IV.XI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—That Portions of the World are Not
to Be Loved; But that God, Their Author, is Immutable, and His Word
Eternal.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.XI-p2"></span>16. Be not foolish, O my soul, and deaden
not the ear of thine heart with the tumult of thy folly. Hearken thou
also. The word itself invokes thee to return; and there is the place of
rest imperturbable, where love is not abandoned if itself abandoneth
not. Behold, these things pass away, that others may succeed them, and
so this lower universe be made complete in all its parts. But do I
depart anywhere, saith the word of God? There fix thy habitation. There
commit whatsoever thou hast thence, O my soul; at all events now thou
art tired out with deceits. Commit to truth whatsoever thou hast from
the truth, and nothing shall thou lose; and thy decay shall flourish
again, and all thy diseases be healed, <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) and thy perishable parts shall be
reformed and renovated, and drawn together to thee; nor shall they put
thee down where themselves descend, but they shall abide with thee, and
continue for ever before God, who abideth and continueth for ever. <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md)

<span id="vi.IV.XI-p5"></span>17. Why, then, be perverse and follow thy
flesh? Rather let it be converted and follow thee. Whatever by her thou
feelest, is but in part; and the whole, of which these are portions,
thou art ignorant of, and yet they delight thee. But had the sense of
thy flesh been capable of comprehending the whole, and not itself also,
for thy punishment, been justly limited to a portion of the whole, thou
wouldest that whatsoever existeth at the present time should pass away,
that so the whole might please thee more. <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) For what we speak, also by the same
sense of the flesh thou hearest; and yet wouldest not thou that the
syllables should stay, but fly away, that others may come, and the
whole <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) be heard. Thus it is
always, when any single thing is composed of many, all of which exist
not together, all together would delight more than they do simply could
all be perceived at once. But far better than these is He who made all;
and He is our God, and He passeth not away, for there is nothing to
succeed Him. If bodies please thee, praise God for them, and turn back
thy love upon their Creator, lest in those things which please thee thou
displease.
