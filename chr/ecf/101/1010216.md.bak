<span id="vi.XI.XV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XI.XV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—There is Only a Moment of Present
Time.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XV-p2"></span>18. And yet we say that “time is long and
time is short;” nor do we speak of this save of time past and future. A
long time past, for example, we call a hundred years ago; in like manner
a long time to come, a hundred years hence. But a short time past we
call, say, ten days ago: and a short time to come, ten days hence. But
in what sense is that long or short which is not? For the past is not
now, and the future is not yet. Therefore let us not say, “It is long;”
but let us say of the past, “It hath been long,” and of the future, “It
will be long.” O my Lord, my light, shall not even here Thy truth deride
man? For that past time which was long, was it long when it was already
past, or when it was as yet present? For then it might be long when
there was that which could be long, but when past it no longer was;
wherefore that could not be long which was not at all. Let us not,
therefore, say, “Time past hath been long;” for we shall not find what
may have been long, seeing that since it was past it is not; but let us
say “that present time was long, because when it was present it was
long.” For it had not as yet passed away so as not to be, and therefore
there was that which could be long. But after it passed, that ceased
also to be long which ceased to be.

<span id="vi.XI.XV-p3"></span>19. Let us therefore see, O human soul,
whether present time can be long; for to thee is it given to perceive
and to measure periods of time. What wilt thou reply to me? Is a hundred
years when present a long time? See, first, whether a hundred years can
be present. For if the first year of these is current, that is present,
but the other ninety and nine are future, and therefore they are not as
yet. But if the second year is current, one is already past, the other
present, the rest future. And thus, if we fix on any middle year of this
hundred as present, those before it are past, those after it are future;
wherefore a hundred years cannot be present. See at least whether that
year itself which is current can be present. For if its first month be
current, the rest are future; if the second, the first hath already
passed, and the remainder are not yet. Therefore neither is the year
which is current as a whole present; and if it is not present as a
whole, then the year is not present. For twelve months make the year, of
which each individual month which is current is itself present, but the
rest are either past or future. Although neither is that month which is
current present, but one day only: if the first, the rest being to come,
if the last, the rest being past; if any of the middle, then between
past and future.

<span id="vi.XI.XV-p4"></span>20. Behold, the present time, which alone
we <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> <span
id="vi.XI.XV-Page_169"></span>found could be called long, is abridged to
the space scarcely of one day. But let us discuss even that, for there
is not one day present as a whole. For it is made up of four-and-twenty
hours of night and day, whereof the first hath the rest future, the last
hath them past, but any one of the intervening hath those before it
past, those after it future. And that one hour passeth away in fleeting
particles. Whatever of it hath flown away is past, whatever remaineth is
future. If any portion of time be conceived which cannot now be divided
into even the minutest particles of moments, this only is that which may
be called present; which, however, flies so rapidly from future to past,
that it cannot be extended by any delay. For if it be extended, it is
divided into the past and future; but the present hath no space. Where,
therefore, is the time which we may call long? Is it nature? Indeed we
do not say, “It is long,” because it is not yet, so as to be long; but
we say, “It will be long.” When, then, will it be? For if even then,
since as yet it is future, it will not be long, because what may be long
is not as yet; but it shall be long, when from the future, which as yet
is not, it shall already have begun to be, and will have become present,
so that there could be that which may be long; then doth the present
time cry out in the words above that it cannot be long.
