id="vi.X.XLI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—Having Conquered His Triple
Desire, He Arrives at Salvation.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XLI-p2"></span>66. And thus have I reflected upon the
wearinesses of my sins, in that threefold “lust,” <span
id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md) and have invoked Thy right hand to my
aid. For with a wounded heart have I seen Thy brightness, and being
beaten back I exclaimed, “Who can attain unto it?” “I am cut off from
before Thine eyes.” <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) Thou art the
Truth, who presidest over all things, but I, through my covetousness,
wished not to lose Thee, but with Thee wished to possess a lie; as no
one wishes so to speak falsely as himself to be ignorant of the truth.
So then I lost Thee, because Thou deignest not to be enjoyed with a lie.
