<span id="vi.IX.II-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IX.II-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—As His Lungs Were Affected, He
Meditates Withdrawing Himself from Public Favour.</span>

<span id="vi.IX.II-p2"></span>2. And it seemed good to me, as before
Thee, not tumultuously to snatch away, but gently to withdraw the
service of my tongue from the talker’s trade; that the young, who
thought not on Thy law, nor on Thy peace, but on mendacious follies and
forensic strifes, might no longer purchase at my mouth equipments for
their vehemence. And opportunely there wanted but a few days unto the
Vacation of the Vintage; <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695) and I
determined to endure them, in order to leave in the usual way, and,
being redeemed by Thee, no more to return for sale. Our intention then
was known to Thee; but to men—excepting our own friends—was it not
known. For we had determined among ourselves not to let it get abroad to
any; although Thou hadst given to us, ascending from the valley of
tears, <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696) and singing the song of
degrees, “sharp arrows,” and destroying coals, against the “deceitful
tongue,” <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697) which in giving
coun<span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span
id="vi.IX.II-Page_130"></span>sel opposes, and in showing love consumes,
as it is wont to do with its food.

<span id="vi.IX.II-p6"></span>3. Thou hadst penetrated our hearts with
Thy charity, and we carried Thy words fixed, as it were, in our bowels;
and the examples of Thy servant, whom of black Thou hadst made bright,
and of dead, alive, crowded in the bosom of our thoughts, burned and
consumed our heavy torpor, that we might not topple into the abyss; and
they enkindled us exceedingly, that every breath of the deceitful tongue
of the gainsayer might inflame us the more, not extinguish us.
Nevertheless, because for Thy name’s sake which Thou hast sanctified
throughout the earth, this, our vow and purpose, might also find
commenders, it looked like a vaunting of oneself not to wait for the
vacation, now so near, but to leave beforehand a public profession, and
one, too, under general observation; so that all who looked on this act
of mine, and saw how near was the vintage-time I desired to anticipate,
would talk of me a great deal as if I were trying to appear to be a
great person. And what purpose would it serve that people should
consider and dispute about my intention, and that our good should be
evil spoken of? <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698)

<span id="vi.IX.II-p8"></span>4. Furthermore, this very summer, from too
great literary labour, my lungs <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699)
began to be weak, and with difficulty to draw deep breaths; showing by
the pains in my chest that they were affected, and refusing too loud or
prolonged speaking. This had at first been a trial to me, for it
compelled me almost of necessity to lay down that burden of teaching;
or, if I could be cured and become strong again, at least to leave it
off for a while. But when the full desire for leisure, that I might see
that Thou art the Lord, <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700) arose,
and was confirmed in me, my God, Thou knowest I even began to rejoice
that I had this excuse ready,—and that not a feigned one,—which might
somewhat temper the offence taken by those who for their sons’ good
wished me never to have the freedom of sons. Full, therefore, with such
joy, I bore it till that period of time had passed,—perhaps it was some
twenty days,—yet they were bravely borne; for the cupidity which was
wont to sustain part of this weighty business had departed, and I had
remained overwhelmed had not its place been supplied by patience. Some
of Thy servants, my brethren, may perchance say that I sinned in this,
in that having once fully, and from my heart, entered on Thy warfare, I
permitted myself to sit a single hour in the seat of falsehood. I will
not contend. But hast not Thou, O most merciful Lord, pardoned and
remitted this sin also, with my others, so horrible and deadly, in the
holy water?

<span id="vi.IX.II-p3"></span> “In harvest and vintage time had the
lawyers their vacation. So Minutius Felix. Scholars, their *Non
Terminus*, as here; yea, divinity lectures and catechizings then ceased.
So Cyprian, *Ep.* 2. The law terms gave way also to the great festivals
of the Church. Theodosius forbade any process to go out from fifteen
days before Easter till the Sunday after. For the four Terms, see Caroli
Calvi, *Capitula*, [Act viii.](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#000)<span

according to the *Old Ver.* This passage has many difficulties we need
not enter into. The Vulgate, however, we may say, renders verse 3: “Quid
detur tibi aut quid apponatur tibi ad linguam dolosam,”—that is, shall
be given as a defence against the tongues of evil speakers. In this way
Augustin understands it, and in his commentary on this place makes the
fourth verse give the answer to the third. Thus, “sharp arrows” he
interprets to be the word of God, and “destroying coals” those who,
being converted to Him, have become examples to the ungodly.

therefore led to give up his professorship, partly from this cause, and
partly from a desire to devote himself more entirely to God’s service.
