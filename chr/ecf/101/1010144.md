<span id="vi.IX.I-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IX.I-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—He Praises God, the Author of
Safety, and Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, Acknowledging His Own
Wickedness.</span>

<span id="vi.IX.I-p2"></span>1. “<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.IX.I-p2.1"></span>O Lord</span>, truly I am Thy servant; I am Thy
servant, and the son of Thine handmaid: Thou hast loosed my bonds. I
will offer to Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving.” <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) Let my heart and my tongue praise
Thee, and let all my bones say, “Lord, who is like unto Thee?” <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) Let them so say, and answer Thou me,
and “say unto my soul, I am Thy salvation.” <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) Who am I, and what is my nature? How
evil have not my deeds been; or if not my deeds, my words; or if not my
words, my will? But Thou, O Lord, art good and merciful, and Thy right
hand had respect unto the profoundness of my death, and removed from the
bottom of my heart that abyss of corruption. And this was the result,
that I willed not to do what I willed, and willed to do what thou
willedst. <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) But where, during all
those years, and out of what deep and secret retreat was my free will
summoned forth in a moment, whereby I gave my neck to Thy “easy yoke,”
and my shoulders to Thy “light burden,” <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) O Christ Jesus, “my strength and my
Redeemer”? <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) How sweet did it
suddenly become to me to be without the delights of trifles! And what at
one time I feared to lose, it was now a joy to me to put away. <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) For Thou didst cast them away from me,
Thou true and highest sweetness. Thou didst cast them away, and instead
of them didst enter in Thyself, <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md)
—sweeter than all pleasure, though not to flesh and blood; brighter than
all light, but more veiled than all mysteries; more exalted than all
honour, but not to the exalted in their own conceits. Now was my soul
free from the gnawing cares of seeking and getting, and of wallowing and
exciting the itch of lust. And I babbled unto Thee my brightness, my
riches, and my health, the Lord my God.

<span id="vi.IX.I-p9"></span> Archbishop Trench, in his exposition of
the parable of the Hid Treasure, which the man who found sold all that
he had to buy, remarks on this passage of the *Confessions*: “Augustin
excellently illustrates from his own experience this part of the
parable. Describing the crisis of his own conversion, and how easy he
found it, through this joy, to give up all those pleasures of sin that
he had long dreaded to be obliged to renounce, which had long held him
fast bound in the chains of evil custom, and which if he renounced, it
had seemed to him as though life itself would not be worth the living,
he exclaims, ‘How sweet did it suddenly become to me,’” etc.

<span id="vi.IX.I-p10"></span> His love of earthly things was expelled
by the indwelling love of God, “for,” as he says in his *De Musica*, vi.
52, “the love of the things of time could only be expelled by some
sweetness of things eternal.” Compare also Dr. Chalmers’ sermon on *The
Expulsive Power of a New Affection* (the ninth of his “Commercial
Discourses”), where this idea is expanded.
