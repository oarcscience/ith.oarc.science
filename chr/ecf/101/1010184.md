Long Without God.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXVII-p2"></span>38. Too late did I love Thee, O
Fairness, so ancient, and yet so new! Too late did I love Thee! For
behold, Thou wert within, and I without, and there did I seek Thee; I,
unlovely, rushed heedlessly among the things of beauty Thou
madest. <span id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md) Thou wert with me, but I
was <span id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span
id="vi.X.XXVII-Page_153"></span>not with Thee. Those things kept me far
from Thee, which, unless they were in Thee, were not. Thou calledst, and
criedst aloud, and forcedst open my deafness. Thou didst gleam and
shine, and chase away my blindness. Thou didst exhale odours, and I drew
in my breath and do pant after Thee. I tasted, and do hunger and thirst.
Thou didst touch me, and I burned for Thy peace.
