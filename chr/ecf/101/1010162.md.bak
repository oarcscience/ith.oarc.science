<span id="vi.X.V-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.V-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—That Man Knoweth Not Himself
Wholly.</span>

<span id="vi.X.V-p2"></span>7. For it is Thou, Lord, that judgest
me; <span id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) for although no “man knoweth
the things of a <span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span
id="vi.X.V-Page_144"></span>man, save the spirit of man which is in
him,” <span id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) yet is there something of
man which “the spirit of man which is in him” itself knoweth not. But
Thou, Lord, who hast made him, knowest him wholly. I indeed, though in
Thy sight I despise myself, and reckon “myself but dust and
ashes,” <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) yet know something
concerning Thee, which I know not concerning myself. And assuredly “now
we see through a glass darkly,” not yet “face to face.” <span
id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) So long, therefore, as I be “absent”
from Thee, I am more “present” with myself than with Thee; <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) and yet know I that Thou canst not
suffer violence; <span id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) but for myself
I know not what temptations I am able to resist, and what I am not
able. <span id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) But there is hope, because
Thou art faithful, who wilt not suffer us to be tempted above that we
are able, but wilt with the temptation also make a way to escape, that
we may be able to bear it. <span id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md) I
would therefore confess what I know concerning myself; I will confess
also what I know not concerning myself. And because what I do know of
myself, I know by Thee enlightening me; and what I know not of myself,
so long I know not until the time when my “darkness be as the
noonday” <span id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) in Thy sight.
