God Out of Nothing.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXIII-p2"></span>48. Let Thy works praise Thee, that
we may love Thee; and let us love Thee, that Thy works may praise Thee,
the which have beginning and end from time,—rising and setting, growth
and decay, form and privation. They have therefore their successions of
morning and evening, partly hidden, partly apparent; for they were made
from nothing by Thee, not of Thee, nor of any matter not Thine, or which
was created before, but of concreted matter (that is, matter at the same
time created by Thee), because without any interval of time Thou didst
form its formlessness. <span id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) For
since the matter of heaven and earth is one thing, and the form of
heaven and earth another, Thou hast made the matter indeed of almost
nothing, but the form of the world Thou hast formed of formless matter;
both, however, at the same time, so that the form should follow the
matter with no interval of delay.
