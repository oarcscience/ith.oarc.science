<span id="vi.XIII.XXV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—He Explains the Fruits of the
Earth (Ver. 29) of Works of Mercy.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXV-p2"></span>38. I would also say, O Lord my God,
what the following Scripture reminds me of; yea, I will say it without
fear. For I will speak the truth, Thou inspiring me as to what Thou
willest that I should say out of these words. For by none other than Thy
inspiration do I believe that I can speak the truth, since Thou art the
Truth, but every man a liar. <span id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md)
And therefore he that “speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own;” <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) therefore that I may speak the
truth, I will speak of Thine. Behold, Thou hast given unto us for food
“every herb bearing seed,” which is upon the face of all the earth, “and
every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed.” <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) Nor to us only, but to all the
fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth, and to all creeping
things; <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) but unto the fishes,
and great whales, Thou hast not given these things. Now we were saying,
that by these fruits of the earth works of mercy were signified and
figured in an allegory, the which are provided for the necessities of
this life out of the fruitful earth. Such an earth was the godly
Onesiphorus, unto whose house Thou didst give mercy, because he
frequently refreshed Thy Paul, and was not ashamed of his chain. <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md) This did also the brethren, and
such fruit did they bear, who out of Macedonia supplied what was wanting
unto him. <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) But how doth he
grieve for certain trees, which did not afford him the fruit due unto
him, when he saith, “At my first answer no man stood with me, but all
men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their
charge.” <span id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) For these fruits are
due to those who minister spiritual <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md) doctrine, through their
understanding of the divine mysteries; and they are due to them as men.
They are due to them, too, as to the living soul, supplying itself as an
example in all continency; and due unto them likewise as flying
creatures, for their blessings which are multiplied upon the earth,
since their sound went out into all lands. <span
