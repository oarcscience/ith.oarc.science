<span id="vii.1.I-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.I-p3.1"></span>To Hermogenianus <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) Augustin Sends Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.I-p5"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.I-p5.1"></span>I Would</span> not presume, even in playful
discussion, to attack the philosophers of the Academy; <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) for when could the authority of
such eminent men fail to move me, did I not believe their views to be
widely different from those commonly ascribed to them? Instead of
confuting them, which is beyond my power, I have rather imitated them to
the best of my ability. For it seems to me to have been suitable enough
to the times in which they flourished, that whatever issued pure from
the fountainhead of Platonic philosophy should be rather conducted into
dark and thorny thickets for the refreshment of a very few *men*, than
left to flow in open meadow-land, where it would be impossible to keep
it clear and pure from the inroads of the vulgar herd. I use the word
herd advisedly; for what is more brutish than the opinion that the soul
is material? For defence against the men who held this, it appears to me
that such an art and method of concealing the truth <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) was wisely contrived by the new
Academy. But in this age of ours, when we see none who are
philosophers,—for I do not consider those who merely wear the cloak of a
philosopher to be worthy of that venerable name,—it seems to me that men
(those, at least, whom the teaching of the Academicians has, through the
subtlety of the terms in which it was expressed, deterred from
attempting to understand its actual meaning) should be brought back to
the hope of discovering the truth, lest that which was then for the time
useful in eradicating obstinate error, should begin now to hinder the
casting in of the seeds of true knowledge.

<span id="vii.1.I-p8"></span>2. In that age the studies of contending
schools of philosophers were pursued with such ardour, that the one
thing to be feared was the possibility of error being approved. For
every one who had been driven by the arguments of the sceptical
philosophers from a position which he had supposed to be impregnable,
set himself to seek some other in its stead, with a perseverance and
caution corresponding to the greater industry which was characteristic
of the men of that time, and the strength of the persuasion then
prevailing, that truth, though deep and hard to be deciphered, does lie
hidden in the nature of things and of the human mind. Now, however, such
is the indisposition to strenuous exertion, and the indifference to the
liberal arts, that so soon as it is noised abroad that, in the opinion
of the most acute philosophers, truth is unattainable, men send their
minds to sleep, and cover them up for ever. For they presume not,
forsooth, to imagine themselves to be so superior in discernment to
those great men, that they shall find out what, during his singularly
long life, Carneades, <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) with
all his diligence, talents, and leisure, besides his extensive and
varied learning, failed to discover. And if, contending somewhat against
indolence, they rouse themselves so far as to read those books in which
it is, as it were, proved that the perception of truth is denied to man,
they relapse into lethargy so profound, that not even by the heavenly
trumpet can they be aroused.

<span id="vii.1.I-p10"></span>3. Wherefore, although I accept with the
greatest pleasure your candid estimate of my brief treatise, and esteem
you so much as to rely not less on the sagacity of your judgment than on
the sincerity of your friendship, I beg you to give more particular
attention to one point, and to write me again concerning it,—namely,
whether you approve of that which, in the end of the third book, <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) I have given as my opinion, in a
tone perhaps of hesitation rather than of certainty, but in statements,
as I think, more likely to be found useful than to be rejected as
incredible. But whatever be the value of those treatises <span
id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span id="vii.1.I-Page_220"></span> \[the
books against the Academicians\], what I most rejoice in is, not that I
have vanquished the Academicians, as you express it (using the language
rather of friendly partiality than of truth), but that I have broken and
cast away from me the odious bonds by which I was kept back from the
nourishing breasts of philosophy, through despair of attaining that
truth which is the food of the soul.

<span id="vii.1.I-p4"></span> Hermogenianus was one of the earliest and
most intimate friends of Augustin, and his associate in literary and
philosophical studies.

<span id="vii.1.I-p6"></span> \[Academy was a grove dedicated to the
Attic hero Academos, on the banks of the Kephissos near Athens, where
Plato taught. Hence it became the name of the Platonic school of
philosophy. It had three branches,—the Older, the Middle, and the
Younger Academy. The study of Platonism was a preparatory step to the
conversion of Augustin in 386.—P. S.\]

in the direction of scepticism than Arcesilas, and taught that certain
