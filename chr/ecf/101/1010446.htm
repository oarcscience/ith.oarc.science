<p class="c41"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p1.1"></A>Letter CLXXIII.</span></p>  
<p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p2"></A>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 416.)</p>  
<p class="c40"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p3"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p3.1"></A>To Donatus, a Presbyter of the Donatist Party, Augustin, a Bishop of the Catholic Church, Sends Greeting.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p4"></A>1. If you could see the sorrow of my heart and my concern for your salvation, you would perhaps take pity on your own soul, doing that which is pleasing to God, by giving heed to the word which is not ours but His; and would no longer give to His Scripture only a place in your memory, while shutting it out from your heart. You are angry because you are being drawn to salvation, although you have drawn so many of our fellow Christians to destruction. For what did we order beyond this, that you should be arrested, brought before the authorities, and guarded, in order to prevent you from perishing? As to your having sustained bodily injury, you have yourself to blame for this, as you would not use the horse which was immediately brought to you, and then dashed yourself violently to the ground; for, as you well know, your companion, who was brought along with you, arrived uninjured, not having done any harm to himself as you did.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p5"></A>2. You think, however, that even what we have done to you should not have been done, because, in your opinion, no man should be compelled to that which is good. Mark, therefore, the words of the apostle: &#8220;If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work,&#8221; and yet, in order to make the office of a bishop be accepted by many men, they are seized against their will,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2811"></A><A HREF="#fn_2811"><FONT SIZE="1">2812</FONT></A>
 subjected to importunate persuasion, shut up and detained in custody, and made to suffer so many things which they dislike, until a willingness to undertake the good work is found in them. How much more, then, is it fitting that you should be drawn forcibly away from a pernicious error, in which you are enemies to your own souls, and brought to acquaint yourselves with the truth, or to choose it when known, not only in order to your holding in a safe and advantageous way the honour belonging to your office, but also in order to preserve you from perishing miserably! You say that God has given us free will, and that therefore no man should be compelled even to good. Why, then, are those whom I have above referred to compelled to that which is good? Take heed, therefore, to something which you do not wish to consider. The aim towards which a good will compassionately devotes its efforts is to secure that a bad will be rightly directed. For who does not know that a man is not condemned on any other ground than because his bad will deserved it, and that no man is saved who has not a good will? Nevertheless, it does not follow from this that those who are loved should be cruelly left to yield themselves with impunity to their bad will; but in so far as power is given, they ought to be both prevented from evil and compelled to good.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p7"></A>3. For if a bad will ought to be always left to its own freedom, why were the disobedient and murmuring Israelites restrained from evil by such severe chastisements, and compelled to come into the land of promise? If a bad will ought always to be left to its own freedom, why was Paul not left to the free use of that most perverted will with which he persecuted the Church? Why was he thrown to the ground that he might be blinded, and struck blind that he might be changed, and changed that he might be sent as an apostle, and sent that he might suffer for the truth&#146;s sake such wrongs as he had inflicted on others when he was in error? If a bad will ought always to be left to its own freedom, why is a father instructed in Holy Scripture not only to correct an obstinate son by words of rebuke, but also to beat his sides, in order that, being compelled and subdued, he may be guided to good conduct?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2812"></A><A HREF="#fn_2812"><FONT SIZE="1">2813</FONT></A>
 For which reason Solomon <A NAME="page_545"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 545</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-Page_545"></A>also says: &#8220;Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2813"></A><A HREF="#fn_2813"><FONT SIZE="1">2814</FONT></A>
 If a bad will ought always to be left to its own freedom, why are negligent pastors reproved? and why is it said to them, &#8220;Ye have not brought back the wandering sheep, ye have not sought the perishing&#8221;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2814"></A><A HREF="#fn_2814"><FONT SIZE="1">2815</FONT></A>
 You also are sheep belonging to Christ, you bear the Lord&#146;s mark in the sacrament which you have received, but you are wandering and perishing. Let us not, therefore, incur your displeasure because we bring back the wandering and seek the perishing; for it is better for us to obey the will of the Lord, who charges us to compel you to return to His fold, than to yield consent to the will of the wandering sheep, so as to leave you to perish. Say not, therefore, what I hear that you are constantly saying, &#8220;I wish thus to wander; I wish thus to perish;&#8221; for it is better that we should so far as is in our power absolutely refuse to allow you to wander and perish.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p11"></A>4. When you threw yourself the other day into a well, in order to bring death upon yourself, you did so no doubt with your free will. But how cruel the servants of God would have been if they had left you to the fruits of this bad will, and had not delivered you from that death! Who would not have justly blamed them? Who would not have justly denounced them as inhuman? And yet you, with your own free will, threw yourself into the water that you might be drowned. They took you against your will out of the water, that you might not be drowned. You acted according to your own will, but with a view to your destruction; they dealt with you against your will, but in order to your preservation. If, therefore, mere bodily safety behoves to be so guarded that it is the duty of those who love their neighhour to preserve him even against his own will from harm, how much more is this duty binding in regard to that spiritual health in the loss of which the consequence to be dreaded is eternal death! At the same time let me remark, that in that death which you wished to bring upon yourself you would have died not for time only but for eternity, because even though force had been used to compel you&#8212;not to accept salvation, not to enter into the peace of the Church, the unity of Christ&#146;s body, the holy indivisible charity, but&#8212;to suffer some evil things, it would not have been lawful for you to take away your own life.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p12"></A>5. Consider the divine Scriptures, and examine them to the utmost of your ability, and see whether this was ever done by any one of the just and faithful, though subjected to the most grievous evils by persons who were endeavouring to drive them, not to eternal life, to which you are being compelled by us, but to eternal death. I have heard that you say that the Apostle Paul intimated the lawfulness of suicide, when he said, &#8220;Though I give my body to be burned,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2815"></A><A HREF="#fn_2815"><FONT SIZE="1">2816</FONT></A>
 supposing that because he was there enumerating all the good things which are of no avail without charity, such as the tongues of men and of angels, and all mysteries, and all knowledge, and all prophecy, and the distribution of one&#146;s goods to the poor, he intended to include among these good things the act of bringing death upon one-self. But observe carefully and learn in what sense Scripture says that any man may give his body to be burned. Certainly not that any man may throw himself into the fire when he is harassed by a pursuing enemy, but that, when he is compelled to choose between doing wrong and suffering wrong, he should refuse to do wrong rather than to suffer wrong, and so give his body into the power of the executioner, as those three men did who were being compelled to worship the golden image, while he who was compelling them threatened them with the burning fiery furnace if they did not obey. They refused to worship the image: they did not cast themselves into the fire, and yet of them it is written that they &#8220;yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2816"></A><A HREF="#fn_2816"><FONT SIZE="1">2817</FONT></A>
 This is the sense in which the apostle said, &#8220;If I give my body to be burned.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p15"></A>6. Mark also what follows:&#8212;&#8220;If I have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.&#8221; To that charity you are called; by that charity you are prevented from perishing: and yet you think, forsooth, that to throw yourself headlong to destruction, by your own act, will profit you in some measure, although, even if you suffered death at the hands of another, while you remain an enemy to charity it would profit you nothing. Nay, more, being in a state of exclusion from the Church, and severed from the body of unity and the bond of charity, you would be punished with eternal misery even though you were burned alive for Christ&#146;s name; for this is the apostle&#146;s declaration, &#8220;Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.&#8221; Bring your mind back, therefore, to rational reflection and sober thought; consider carefully whether it is to error and to impiety that you are being called, and, if you still think so, submit patiently to any hardship for the truth&#146;s sake. If, however, the fact rather be that you are living in error and in impiety, and that in the Church to which you are called truth and piety are found, because there is Christian unity and the love (<i>charitas</i>) of the Holy Spirit, why  <A NAME="page_546"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 546</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-Page_546"></A>do you labour any longer to be an enemy to yourself?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p16"></A>7. For this end the mercy of the Lord appointed that both we and your bishops met at Carthage in a conference which had repeated meetings, and was largely attended, and reasoned together in the most orderly manner in regard to the grounds of our separation from each other. The proceedings of that conference were written down; our signatures are attached to the record: read it, or allow others to read it to you, and then choose which party you prefer. I have heard that you have said that you could to some extent discuss the statements in that record with us if we would omit these words of your bishops: &#8220;No case forecloses the investigation of another case, and no person compromises the position of another person.&#8221; You wish us to leave out these words, in which, although they knew it not, the truth itself spoke by them. You will say, indeed, that here they made a mistake, and fell through want of consideration into a false opinion. But we affirm that here they said what was true, and we prove this very easily by a reference to yourself. For if in regard to these bishops of your own, chosen by the whole party of Donatus on the understanding that they should act as representatives, and that all the rest should regard whatever they did as acceptable and satisfactory, you nevertheless refuse to allow them to compromise your position by what you think to have been a rash and mistaken utterance on their part, in this refusal you confirm the truth of their saying: &#8220;No case forecloses the investigation of another case, and no person compromises the position of another person.&#8221; And at the same time you ought to acknowledge, that if you refuse to allow the conjoint authority of so many of your bishops represented in these seven to compromise Donatus, presbyter in Mutugenna, it is incomparably less reasonable that one person, C&aelig;cilianus, even had some evil been found in him, should compromise the position of the whole unity of Christ, the Church, which is not shut up within the one village of Mutugenna, but spread abroad throughout the entire world.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p17"></A>8. But, behold, we do what you have desired; we treat with you as if your bishops had not said: &#8220;No case forecloses the investigation of another case, and no person compromises the position of another person.&#8221; Discover, if you can, what they ought, rather than this, to have said in reply, when there was alleged against them the case and the person of Primianus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2817"></A><A HREF="#fn_2817"><FONT SIZE="1">2818</FONT></A>
 who, notwithstanding his joining the rest of the bishops in passing sentence of condemnation on those who had passed sentence of condemnation upon him, nevertheless received back into their former honours those whom he had condemned and denounced, and chose to acknowledge and accept rather than despise and repudiate the baptism administered by these men while they were &#8220;dead&#8221; (for of them it was said in the notable decree [of the Council of Bagai], that &#8220;the shores were full of dead men&#8221;), and by so doing swept away the argument which you are accustomed to rest on a perverse interpretation of the words: &#8220;Qui baptizatur a mortuo quid ei prodest lavacrum ejus?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2818"></A><A HREF="#fn_2818"><FONT SIZE="1">2819</FONT></A>
 If, therefore, your bishops had not said: &#8220;No case forecloses the investigation of another case, and no person compromises the position of another person,&#8221; they would have been compelled to plead guilty in the case of Primianus; but, in saying this, they declared the Catholic Church to be, as we mentioned, not guilty in the case of C&aelig;cilianus.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p20"></A>9. However, read all the rest and examine it well. Mark whether they have succeeded in proving any charge of evil brought against C&aelig;cilianus himself, through whose person they attempted to compromise the position of the Church. Mark whether they have not rather brought forward much that was in his favour, and confirmed the evidence that his case was a good one, by a number of extracts which, to the prejudice of their own case, they produced and read. Read these or let them be read to you. Consider the whole matter, ponder it carefully, and choose which you should follow: whether you should, in the peace of Christ, in the unity of the Catholic Church, in the love of the brethren, be partaker of our joy, or, in the cause of wicked discord, the Donatist faction and impious schism, continue to suffer the annoyance caused to you by the measures which out of love to you we are compelled to take.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p21"></A>10. I hear that you have remarked and often quote the fact recorded in the gospels, that the seventy disciples went back from the Lord, and that they had been left to their own choice in this wicked and impious desertion, and that to the twelve who alone remained the Lord said, &#8220;Will ye also go away?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2819"></A><A HREF="#fn_2819"><FONT SIZE="1">2820</FONT></A>
 But you have neglected to remark, that at that time the Church was only beginning to burst into life from the recently planted seed, and that there was not yet fulfilled in her the prophecy: &#8220;All kings shall fall down before Him; yea, all nations shall serve <A NAME="page_547"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 547</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-Page_547"></A>Him;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2820"></A><A HREF="#fn_2820"><FONT SIZE="1">2821</FONT></A>
 and it is in proportion to the more enlarged accomplishment of this prophecy that the Church wields greater power, so that she may not only invite, but even compel men to embrace what is good. This our Lord intended then to illustrate, for although He had great power, He chose rather to manifest His humility. This also He taught, with sufficient plainness, in the parable of the Feast, in which the master of the house, after He had sent a message to the invited guests, and they had refused to come, said to his servants: &#8220;Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. And the Lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2821"></A><A HREF="#fn_2821"><FONT SIZE="1">2822</FONT></A>
 Mark, now, how it was said in regard to those who came first, &#8220;bring them in;&#8221; it was not said, &#8220;compel them to come in,&#8221;&#8212;by which was signified the incipient condition of the Church, when it was only growing towards the position in which it would have strength to compel men to come in. Accordingly, because it was right that when the Church had been strengthened, both in power and in extent, men should be compelled to come in to the feast of everlasting salvation, it was afterwards added in the parable, &#8220;The servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. And the Lord said unto the servants, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in.&#8221; Wherefore, if you were walking peaceably, absent from this feast of everlasting salvation and of the holy unity of the Church, we should find you, as it were, in the &#8220;highways;&#8221; but since, by multiplied injuries and cruelties, which you perpetrate on our people, you are, as it were, full of thorns and roughness, we find you as it were in the &#8220;hedges,&#8221; and we compel you to come in. The sheep which is compelled is driven whither it would not wish to go, but after it has entered, it feeds of its own accord in the pastures to which it was brought. Wherefore restrain your perverse and rebellious spirit, that in the true Church of Christ you may find the feast of salvation.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vii.1.CLXXIII-p18"></A> Primianus, Donatist bishop in Carthage, was in 393 deposed by a factious clique of bishops, who appointed Maximianus in his place. The other Donatist bishops, however, assembled in the following year at Bagai in Numidia, and, reversing the decision of their co-bishops deposed them in turn, and passed a sentence to which, as stated in the text, they did not inexorably adhere. The matter is referred to in Letter XLIII. p. 276.</p>
