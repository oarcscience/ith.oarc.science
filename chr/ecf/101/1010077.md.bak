<span id="vi.V.I-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.V.I-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—That It Becomes the Soul to Praise
God, and to Confess Unto Him.</span>

<span id="vi.V.I-p2"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.V.I-p2.1"></span>Accept</span> the sacrifice of my confessions by
the agency of my tongue, which Thou hast formed and quickened, that it
may confess to Thy name; and heal Thou all my bones, and let them say,
“Lord, who is like unto Thee?” <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md)
For neither does he who confesses to Thee teach Thee what may be passing
within him, because a closed heart doth not exclude Thine eye, nor does
man’s hardness of heart repulse Thine hand, but Thou dissolvest it when
Thou wiliest, either in pity or in vengeance, “and there is no One who
can hide himself from Thy heart.” <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) But let my soul praise Thee, that it
may love Thee; and let it confess Thine own mercies to Thee, that it may
praise Thee. Thy whole creation ceaseth not, nor is it silent in Thy
praises—neither the spirit of man, by the voice directed unto Thee, nor
animal nor corporeal things, by the voice of those meditating
thereon; <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) so that our souls may
from their weariness arise towards Thee, leaning on those things which
Thou hast made, and passing on to Thee, who hast made them wonderfully
and there is there refreshment and true strength.

<span id="vi.V.I-p5"></span> St. Paul speaks of a “minding of the flesh”
and a “minding of the spirit” ([Rom.
8.6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006.md)<span id="vi.V.I-p5.1"></span>,
margin), and we are prone to be attracted and held by the carnal
surroundings of life; that is, “quæ per carnem sentiri querunt id est
per oculos, per aures, ceterosque corporis sensus” (*De Vera Relig.*.
xxiv.). But God would have us, as we meditate on the things that enter
by the gates of the senses, to arise towards Him, through these His
creatures. Our Father in heaven might have ordered His creation simply
in a utilitarian way, letting, for example, hunger be satisfied without
any of the pleasures of taste, and so of the other senses. But He has
not so done. To every sense He has given its appropriate pleasure as
well as its proper use. And though this presents to us a source of
temptation, still ought we for it to praise His goodness to the full,
and that *corde are opere.*—Bradward, ii. c. 23. See also i. sec. 1,
note 3, and iv. sec. 18, above.
