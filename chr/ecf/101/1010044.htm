<p class="c10"><a name="vi.II_1.IX-p2"></A>17. By what feelings, then, was I animated? For it was in truth too shameful; and woe was me who had it. But still what was it? &#8220;Who can understand his errors?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">216</FONT></A>
 We laughed, because our hearts were tickled at the thought of deceiving those who little imagined what we were doing, and would have vehemently disapproved of it. Yet, again, why did I so rejoice in this, that I did it not alone? Is it that no one readily laughs alone? No one does so readily; but yet sometimes, when men are alone by themselves, nobody being by, a fit of laughter overcomes them when anything very droll presents itself to their senses or mind. Yet alone I would not have done it&#8212;alone I could not at all have done it. Behold, my God, the lively recollection of my soul is laid bare before Thee&#8212;alone I had not committed that theft, wherein what I stole pleased me not, but rather the act of stealing; nor to have done it alone would I have liked so well, neither would I have done it. O Friendship too unfriendly! thou mysterious seducer of the soul, thou greediness to do mischief out of mirth and wantonness, thou craving for others&#146; loss, without desire for my own profit or revenge; but when they say, &#8220;Let us go, let us do it,&#8221; we are ashamed not to be shameless.</p>
