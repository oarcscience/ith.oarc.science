<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXIV.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 396.)

<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXIV-p3.1"></span>To Eusebius, My Excellent Lord and Brother,
Worthy of Affection and Esteem, Augustin Sends Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p4"></span>1. God, to whom the secrets of the
heart of man are open, knoweth that it is because of my love for
Christian peace that I am so deeply moved by the profane deeds of those
who basely and impiously persevere in dissenting from it. He knoweth
also that this feeling of mine is one tending towards peace, and that my
desire is, not that any one should against his will be coerced into the
Catholic communion, but that to all who are in error the truth may be
openly declared, and being by God’s help clearly exhibited through my
ministry, may so commend itself as to make them embrace and follow it.

<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p5"></span>2. Passing many other things unnoticed,
what could be more worthy of detestation than what has just happened? A
young man is reproved by his bishop for frequently beating his mother
like a madman, and not restraining his impious hands from wounding her
who bore him, even on those days on which the sternness of law shows
mercy to the most guilty criminals. <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) He then threatens his mother that
he would pass to the party of the Donatists, and that he would kill her
whom he is accustomed to beat with incredible ferocity. He utters these
threats, then passes over to the Donatists, and is rebaptized while
filled with wicked rage, and is arrayed in white vestments while he is
burning to shed his mother’s blood. He is placed in a prominent and
conspicuous position within the railing in the church; and to the eyes
of sorrowful and indignant beholders, he who is purposing matricide is
exhibited as a regenerate man.

<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p7"></span>3. I appeal to you, as a man of most
mature judgment, can these things find favour in your eyes? I do not
believe this of you: I know your wisdom. A mother is wounded by her son
in the members of that body which bore and nursed the ungrateful wretch;
and when the Church, his spiritual mother, interferes, she too is
wounded in those sacraments by which, to the same ungrateful son, she
ministered life and nourishment. Do you not seem to hear the young man
gnashing his teeth in rage for a parent’s blood, and saying, “What shall
I do to the Church which forbids my wounding my mother? I have found out
what to do: let the Church herself be wounded by such blows as she can
suffer; let that be done in me which may cause her members pain. Let me
go to those who know how to despise the grace with which she gave me
spiritual birth, and to mar the form which in her womb I received. Let
me vex both my natural and my spiritual mother with cruel tortures: let
the one who was the second to give me birth be the first to give me
burial; for her sorrow let me seek spiritual death, and for the other’s
death let me prolong my natural life.” Oh, Eusebius! I appeal to you as
an honourable man, what else may we expect than that now he shall feel
himself, as a Donatist, so armed as to have no fear in assailing that
unhappy woman, decrepit with age and helpless in her widowhood, from
wounding whom he was restrained while he remained a Catholic? For what
else had he purposed in his passionate <span id="page_263">p. 263</span>
<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-Page_263"></span>heart when he said to his mother,
“I will pass over to the party of Donatus, and I will drink your blood?”
Behold, arrayed in white vestments, but with conscience crimson with
blood, he has fulfilled his threat in part; the other part remains, viz.
that he drink his mother’s blood. If, therefore, these things find
favour in your eyes, let him be urged by those who are now his clergy
and his sanctifiers to fulfil within eight days the remaining portion of
his vow.

<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p8"></span>4. The Lord’s right hand indeed is
strong, so that He may keep back this man’s rage from that unhappy and
desolate widow, and, by means known unto His own wisdom, may deter him
from his impious design; but could I do otherwise than utter my feelings
when my heart was pierced with such grief? Shall they do such things,
and am I to be commanded to hold my peace? When He commands me by the
mouth of the apostle saying that those who teach what they ought not
must be rebuked by the bishop, <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) shall I be silent through dread of
their displeasure? The Lord deliver me from such folly! As to my desire
for having such an impious crime recorded in our public registers, it
was desired by me chiefly for this end, that no one who may hear me
bewailing these proceedings, especially in other towns where it may be
expedient for me to do so, may think that I am inventing a falsehood,
and the rather, because in Hippo itself it is already affirmed that
Proculeianus did not issue the order which was in the official report
ascribed to him.

<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p10"></span>5. In what more temperate way could we
dispose of this important matter than through the mediation of such a
man as you, invested with most illustrious rank, and possessing calmness
as well as great prudence and goodwill? I beg, therefore, as I have
already done by our brethren, good and honourable men, whom I sent to
your Excellency, that you will condescend to inquire whether it is the
case that the presbyter Victor did not receive from his bishop the order
which the public official records reported; or whether, since Victor
himself has said otherwise, they have in their records laid a thing
falsely to his charge, though they belong to the same communion with
him. Or, if he consents to our calmly discussing the whole question of
our differences, in order that the error which is already manifest may
become yet more so, I willingly embrace the opportunity. For I have
heard that he proposed that without popular tumult, in the presence only
of ten esteemed and honourable men from each party, we should
investigate what is the truth in this matter according to the
Scriptures. As to another proposal which some have reported to me as
made by him, that I should rather go to Constantina, <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) because in that town his party was
more numerous; or that I should go to Milevis, because there, as they
say, they are soon to hold a council;—these things are absurd, for my
special charge does not extend beyond the Church of Hippo. The whole
importance of this question to me, in the first place, is as it affects
Proculeianus and myself; and if, perchance, he thinks himself not a
match for me, let him implore the aid of any one whom he pleases as his
colleague in the debate. For in other towns we interfere with the
affairs of the Church only so far as is permitted or enjoined by our
brethren bearing the same priestly office with us, the bishops of these
towns.

<span id="vii.1.XXXIV-p12"></span>6. And yet I cannot comprehend what
there is in me, a novice, that should make him, who calls himself a
bishop of so many years’ standing, unwilling and afraid to enter into
discussion with me. If it be my acquaintance with liberal studies, which
perhaps he did not pursue at all, or at least not so much as I have
done, what has this to do with the question in debate, which is to be
decided by the Holy Scriptures or by ecclesiastical or public documents,
with which he has for so many years been conversant, that he ought to be
more skilled in them than I am? Once more, I have here my brother and
colleague Samsucius, bishop of the Church of Turris, <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) who has not learned any of those
branches of culture of which he is said to be afraid: let him attend in
my place, and let the debate be between them. I will ask him, and, as I
trust in the name of Christ, he will readily consent to take my place in
this matter; and the Lord will, I trust, give aid to him when contending
for the truth: for although unpolished in language, he is well
instructed in the true faith. There is therefore no reason for his
referring me to others whom I do not know, instead of letting us settle
between ourselves that which concerns ourselves. However, as I have
said, I will not decline meeting them if he himself asks their
assistance.
