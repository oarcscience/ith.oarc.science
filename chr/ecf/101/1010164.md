id="vi.X.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—That God is to Be Found Neither
from the Powers of the Body Nor of the Soul.</span>

<span id="vi.X.VII-p2"></span>11. What then is it that I love when I
love my God? Who is He that is above the head of my soul? By my soul
itself will I mount up unto Him. I will soar beyond that power of mine
whereby I cling to the body, and fill the whole structure of it with
life. Not by that power do I find my God; for then the horse and the
mule, “which have no understanding,” <span
id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849) might find Him, since it is the same
power by which their bodies also live. But there is another power, not
that only by which I quicken, but that also by which I endow with sense
my flesh, which the Lord hath made for me; bidding the eye not to hear,
and the ear not to see; but that, for me to see by, and this, for me to
hear by; and to each of the other senses its own proper seat and office,
which being different, I, the single mind, do through them govern. I
will soar also beyond this power of mine; for this the horse and mule
possess, for they too discern through the body.
