id="vi.XII.X-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—He Begs of God that He May Live in
the True Light, and May Be Instructed as to the Mysteries of the Sacred
Books.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.X-p2"></span>10. Oh, let Truth, the light of my
heart, <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) not my own darkness,
speak unto me! I have descended to that, and am darkened. But thence,
even thence, did I love Thee. I went astray, and remembered Thee. I
heard Thy voice behind me bidding me return, and scarcely did I hear it
for the tumults of the unquiet ones. And now, behold, I return burning
and panting after Thy fountain. Let no one prohibit me; of this will I
drink, and so have life. Let me not be my own life; from myself have I
badly lived,—death was I unto myself; in Thee do I revive. Do Thou speak
unto me; do Thou discourse unto me. In Thy books have I believed, and
their words are very deep. <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md)

<span id="vi.XII.X-p4"></span> As Gregory the Great has it, Revelation
is a river broad and deep, “In quo et agnus ambulet, et elephas natet.”
And these deep things of God are to be learned only by patient
searching. We must, says St. Chrysostom (*De Prec.* serm. ii.), dive
down into the sea as those who would fetch up pearls from its depths.
The very mysteriousness of Scripture is, doubtless, intended by God to
stimulate us to search the Scriptures, and to strengthen our spiritual
insight (*Enar. in Ps.* cxlvi. 6). See also, p. 48, note 5; p. 164, note
2, above; and the notes on pp. 370, 371, below.
