<span id="vi.II_1.III-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.II_1.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Concerning His Father, a
Freeman of Thagaste, the Assister of His Son’s Studies, and on the
Admonitions of His Mother on the Preservation of Chastity.</span>

<span id="vi.II_1.III-p2"></span>5. And for that year my studies were
intermitted, while after my return from Madaura <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) (a neighbouring city, whither I had
begun to go in order to learn grammar and rhetoric), the expenses for a
further residence at Carthage were provided for me; and that was rather
by the determination than the means of my father, who was but a poor
freeman of Thagaste. To whom do I narrate this? Not unto Thee, my God;
but before Thee unto my own kind, even to that small part of the human
race who may chance to light upon these my writings. And to what end?
That I and all who read the same may reflect out of what depths we are
to cry unto Thee. <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) For what
cometh nearer to Thine ears than a confessing heart and a life of faith?
For who did not extol and praise my father, in that he went even beyond
his means to supply his son with all the necessaries for a far journey
for the sake of his studies? For many far richer citizens did not the
like for their children. But yet this same father did not trouble
himself how I grew towards Thee, nor how chaste I was, so long as I was
skilful in speaking—however barren I was to Thy tilling, O God, who art
the sole true and good Lord of my heart, which is Thy field.

<span id="vi.II_1.III-p5"></span>6. But while, in that sixteenth year of
my age, I resided with my parents, having holiday from school for a time
(this idleness being imposed upon me by my parents’ necessitous
circumstances), the thorns of lust grew rank over my head, and there was
no hand to pluck them out. Moreover when my father, seeing me at the
baths, perceived that I was becoming a man, and was stirred with a
restless youthfulness, he, as if from this anticipating future
descendants, joyfully told it to my mother; rejoicing in that
intoxication wherein the world so often forgets Thee, its Creator, and
falls in love with Thy creature instead of Thee, from the invisible wine
of its own perversity turning and bowing down to the most infamous
things. But in my mother’s breast Thou hadst even now begun Thy temple,
and the commencement of Thy holy habitation, whereas my father was only
a catechumen as yet, and that but recently. She then started up with a
pious fear and trembling; and, although I had not yet been
baptized, <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) she feared those
crooked ways in which they walk who turn their back to Thee, and not
their face. <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md)

<span id="vi.II_1.III-p8"></span>7. Woe is me! and dare I affirm that
Thou heldest Thy peace, O my God, while I strayed farther from Thee?
Didst Thou then hold Thy peace to me? And whose words were they but
Thine which by my mother, Thy faithful handmaid, Thou pouredst into my
ears, none of which sank into my heart to make me do it? For she
desired, and I remember privately warned me, with great solicitude, “not
to commit fornication; but above all things never to defile another
man’s wife.” These appeared to me but womanish counsels, which I should
blush to obey. But they were Thine, and I knew it not, and I thought
that Thou heldest Thy peace, and that it was she who spoke, through whom
Thou heldest not Thy peace to me, and in her person wast despised by me,
her son, “the son of Thy handmaid, Thy servant.” <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) But this I knew not; and rushed on
headlong with such blindness, that amongst my equals I was ashamed to be
less shameless, when I heard them pluming themselves upon their
disgraceful acts, yea, and glorying all the more in proportion to the
greatness of their baseness; and I took pleasure in doing it, not for
the pleasure’s sake only, but for the praise. What is worthy of
dispraise but vice? But I made myself out worse than I was, in order
that I might not be dispraised; and when in anything I had not sinned as
the abandoned ones, I would affirm that I had done what I had not, that
I might not appear abject for being more innocent, or of less esteem for
being more chaste.

<span id="vi.II_1.III-p10"></span>8. Behold with what companions I
walked the streets of Babylon, in whose filth I was rolled, as if in
cinnamon and precious ointments. And that I might cleave the more
tena<span id="page_57">p. 57</span> <span
id="vi.II_1.III-Page_57"></span>ciously to its very centre, my invisible
enemy trod me down, and seduced me, I being easily seduced. Nor did the
mother of my flesh, although she herself had ere this fled “out of the
midst of Babylon,” <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) —progressing,
however, but slowly in the skirts of it,—in counselling me to chastity,
so bear in mind what she had been told about me by her husband as to
restrain in the limits of conjugal affection (if it could not be cut
away to the quick) what she knew to be destructive in the present and
dangerous in the future. But she took no heed of this, for she was
afraid lest a wife should prove a hindrance and a clog to my hopes. Not
those hopes of the future world, which my mother had in Thee; but the
hope of learning, which both my parents were too anxious that I should
acquire,—he, because he had little or no thought of Thee, and but vain
thoughts for me—she, because she calculated that those usual courses of
learning would not only be no drawback, but rather a furtherance towards
my attaining Thee. For thus I conjecture, recalling as well as I can the
dispositions of my parents. The reins, meantime, were slackened towards
me beyond the restraint of due severity, that I might play, yea, even to
dissoluteness, in whatsoever I fancied. And in all there was a mist,
shutting out from my sight the brightness of Thy truth, O my God; and my
iniquity displayed itself as from very “fatness.” <span
