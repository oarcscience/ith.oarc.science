<span id="vi.X.XXXVII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XXXVII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—He is Forcibly Goaded on by
the Love of Praise.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXXVII-p2"></span>60. By these temptations, O Lord, are
we daily tried; yea, unceasingly are we tried. Our daily “furnace” <span
id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953) is the human tongue. And in this
respect also dost Thou command us to be continent. Give what Thou
commandest, and command what Thou wilt. Regarding this matter, Thou
knowest the groans of my heart, and the rivers <span
id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954) of mine eyes. For I am not able to
ascertain how far I am clean of this plague, and I stand in great fear
of my “secret faults,” <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955) which
Thine eyes perceive, though mine do not. For in other kinds of
temptations I have some sort of power of examining myself; but in this,
hardly any. For, both as regards the pleasures of the flesh and an idle
curiosity, I see how far I have been able to hold my mind in check when
I do without them, either voluntarily or by reason of their not being at
hand; <span id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956) for then I inquire of
myself how much more or less troublesome it is to me not to have them.
Riches truly which are sought for in order that they may minister to
some one of these three “lusts,” <span id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957)
or to two, or the whole of them, if the mind be not able to see clearly
whether, when it hath them, it despiseth them, they may be cast on one
side, that so it may prove itself. But if we desire to test our power of
doing without praise, need we live ill, and that so flagitiously and
immoderately as that every one who knows us shall detest us? What
greater madness than this can be either said or conceived? But if praise
both is wont and ought to be the companion of a good life and of good
works, we should as little forego its companionship as a good life
itself. But unless a thing be absent, I do not know whether I shall be
contented or troubled at being without it.

<span id="vi.X.XXXVII-p8"></span>61. What, then, do I confess unto Thee,
O Lord, in this kind of temptation? What, save that I am delighted with
praise, but more with the truth itself than with praise? For were I to
have my choice, whether I had rather, being <span id="page_160">p.
160</span> <span id="vi.X.XXXVII-Page_160"></span>mad, or astray on all
things, be praised by all men, or, being firm and well-assured in the
truth, be blamed by all, I see which I should choose. Yet would I be
unwilling that the approval of another should even add to my joy for any
good I have. Yet I admit that it doth increase it, and, more than that,
that dispraise doth diminish it. And when I am disquieted at this misery
of mine, an excuse presents itself to me, the value of which Thou, God,
knowest, for it renders me uncertain. For since it is not continency
alone that Thou hast enjoined upon us, that is, from what things to hold
back our love, but righteousness also, that is, upon what to bestow it,
and hast wished us to love not Thee only, but also our neighbour, <span
id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958) —often, when gratified by intelligent
praise, I appear to myself to be gratified by the proficiency or
towardliness of my neighbour, and again to be sorry for evil in him when
I hear him dispraise either that which he understands not, or is good.
For I am sometimes grieved at mine own praise, either when those things
which I am displeased at in myself be praised in me, or even lesser and
trifling goods are more valued than they should be. But, again, how do I
know whether I am thus affected, because I am unwilling that he who
praiseth me should differ from me concerning myself—not as being moved
with consideration for him, but because the same good things which
please me in myself are more pleasing to me when they also please
another? For, in a sort, I am not praised when my judgment of myself is
not praised; since either those things which are displeasing to me are
praised, or those more so which are less pleasing to me. Am I then
uncertain of myself in this matter?

<span id="vi.X.XXXVII-p10"></span>62. Behold, O Truth, in Thee do I see
that I ought not to be moved at my own praises for my own sake, but for
my neighbour’s good. And whether it be so, in truth I know not. For
concerning this I know less of myself than dost Thou. I beseech Thee
now, O my God, to reveal to me myself also, that I may confess unto my
brethren, who are to pray for me, what I find in myself weak. Once again
let me more diligently examine myself. <span
id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959) If, in mine own praise, I am moved
with consideration for my neighbour, why am I less moved if some other
man be unjustly dispraised than if it be myself? Why am I more irritated
at that reproach which is cast upon myself, than at that which is with
equal injustice cast upon another in my presence? Am I ignorant of this
also? or does it remain that I deceive myself, <span
id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960) and do not the “truth” <span
id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961) before Thee in my heart and tongue?
Put such madness far from me, O Lord, lest my mouth be to me the oil of
sinners, to anoint my head. <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962)

<span id="vi.X.XXXVII-p11"></span> It may be well, in connection with
the striking piece of soul-anatomy in this and the last two sections, to
advert to other passages in which Augustin speaks of the temptation
arising from the praise of men. In *Serm.* cccxxxix. 1, he says that he
does not altogether dislike praise when it comes from the good, though
feeling it to be a snare, and does not reject it: “Ne *ingrati* sint
quibus prædico.” That is, as he says above, he accepted it for his
“neighbour’s good,” since, had his neighbour not been ready to give
praise, it would have indicated a wrong condition of heart in him. We
are, therefore, as he argues in his *De Serm. Dom. in Mon.* ii. 1, 2, 6,
to see that the *design* of our acts be not that men should see and
praise us (compare also *Enarr. in Ps.* lxv. 2). If they praise us it is
well, since it shows that their heart is right; but if we “act rightly
only *because* of the praise of men” ([Matt.
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005)<span
id="vi.X.XXXVII-p11.1"></span>), we seek our own glory and not that of
God. See also *Serms.* xciii. 9, clix. 10, etc.; and *De Civ. Dei*, v.
13, 14.

Authorized Version (with which the *Targum* is in accord) gives the more
probable sense, when it makes the oil to be that of the righteous and
not that of the sinner: “Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a
kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil, which
shall not break my head.”
