<span id="vi.XII.XXIV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XXIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Out of the Many True Things,
It is Not Asserted Confidently that Moses Understood This or
That.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XXIV-p2"></span>33. But which of us, amid so many
truths which occur to inquirers in these words, understood as they are
in different ways, shall so discover that one interpretation as to
confidently say “that Moses thought this,” and “that in that narrative
he wished this to be understood,” as confidently as he says “that this
is true,” whether he thought this thing or the other? For behold, O my
God, I Thy servant, who in this book have vowed unto Thee a sacrifice of
confession, and beseech Thee that of Thy mercy I may pay my vows unto
Thee, <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) behold, can I, as I
confidently assert that Thou in Thy immutable word hast created all
things, invisible and visible, with equal confidence assert that Moses
meant nothing else than this when he wrote, “In the beginning God
created. the heaven and the earth.” <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) No. Because it is not as clear to
me that this was in his mind when he wrote these things, as I see it to
be certain in Thy truth. For his thoughts might be set upon the very
beginning of the creation when he said, “In the beginning;” and he might
wish it to be understood that, in this place, “the heaven and the earth”
were no formed and perfected nature, whether spiritual or corporeal, but
each of them newly begun, and as yet formless. Because I see, that
which-soever of these had been said, it might have been said truly; but
which of them he may have thought in these words, I do not so perceive.
Although, whether it were one of these, or some other meaning which has
not been mentioned by me, that this great man saw in his mind when he
used these words, I make no doubt but that he saw it truly, and
expressed it suitably.

<span id="vi.XII.XXIV-p4"></span> It is curious to note here Fichte’s
strange idea (*<span id="vi.XII.XXIV-p4.1"></span>Anweisung zum seligen
Leben*, Werke, v. 479), that St. John, at the commencement of his
Gospel, in his teaching as to the “Word,” intended to confute the Mosaic
statement, which Fichte—since it ran counter to that idea of “the
absolute” which he made the point of departure in his
philosophy—antagonizes as a heathen and Jewish error. On “In the
Beginning,” see p. 166, note 2, above.
