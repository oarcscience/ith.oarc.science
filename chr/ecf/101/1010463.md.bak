<span id="vii.1.CCXIX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCXIX-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXIX-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXIX-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 436.)

<span id="vii.1.CCXIX-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXIX-p3.1"></span>To Proculus and Cylinus, Brethren Most
Beloved and Honourable, and Partners in the Sacerdotal Office, Augustin,
Florentius, and Secundinus Send Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXIX-p4"></span>1. When our son Leporius, whom for his
obstinacy in error you had justly and fitly rebuked, came to us after he
had been expelled by you, we received him as one afflicted for his good,
whom we should, if possible, deliver from error and restore to spiritual
health. For, as you obeyed in regard to him the apostolic precept, “Warn
the unruly,” so it was our part to obey the precept immediately annexed,
“Comfort the feeble-minded, and support the weak.” <span
id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md) His error was indeed not
unimportant, seeing that he neither approved what is right nor perceived
what is true in some things relating to the only-begotten Son of God, of
whom it is written that, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God,” but that when the fulness of time
had come, “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;” <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957.md) for he denied that God became man,
regarding it as a doctrine from which it must follow necessarily that
the divine substance in which He is equal to the Father suffered some
unworthy change or corruption, and not seeing that he was thus
introducing into the Trinity a fourth person, which is utterly contrary
to the sound doctrine of the Creed and of Catholic truth. Since,
however, dearly beloved and honourable brethren, he had as a fallible
man” been overtaken” in this error, we did our utmost, the Lord helping
us, to instruct him “in the spirit of meekness,” especially remembering
that when the “chosen vessel “gave this command to which we refer, he
added, “Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted,”—lest some,
perchance, should so rejoice in the measure of spiritual progress as to
imagine that they could no longer be tempted like other men,—and joined
with it the salutary and peace-promoting sentence, “Bear ye one
another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. For if a man think
himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth
himself.” <span id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958.md)

<span id="vii.1.CCXIX-p8"></span>2. This restoration of Leporius we
could perhaps in nowise have accomplished, had you not previously
censured and punished those things in him which required correction. So
then the same Lord, our Divine Physician, using His own instruments and
servants, has by you wounded him when he was proud, and by us healed him
when he was penitent, according to his own saying, “I wound, and I
heal.” <span id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959.md) The same Divine Ruler
and Overseer of His own house has by you thrown down what was defective
in the building, and has by us replaced with a well-ordered structure
what he had removed. The same Divine Husbandman has in His careful
diligence by you rooted up what was barren and noxious in His field, and
by us planted what is useful and fruitful. Let us not, therefore,
ascribe glory to ourselves, but to the mercy of Him in whose hand both
we and all our words are. And as we humbly praise the work which you
have done as His ministers in the case of our son aforesaid, so do you
rejoice with holy joy in the work performed by us. Receive, then, with
the love of fathers and of brethren, him whom we have with merciful
severity corrected. For although one part of the work was done by you
and another part by us, both parts, being indispensable to our brother’s
salvation, were done by the same love. The same God was therefore
working in both, for “God is love.” <span
id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960.md)

<span id="vii.1.CCXIX-p11"></span>3. Wherefore, as he has been welcomed
into fellowship by us on the ground of his repentance, let him be
welcomed by you on the ground of his letter, <span
id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md) to which letter we have thought it
right to adhibit our signatures attesting its genuiness. We have not the
least doubt that you, in the exercise of Christian love, will not only
hear with pleasure of his amendment, but also make it known to those to
whom his error was a stumbling-block. For those who came with him to us
have also been corrected and restored along with him, as is declared by
their signatures, which have been adhibited to the letter in our
presence. It remains only that you, being made joyful by the salvation
of a brother, condescend to make us joyful in our turn by sending a
reply to our communication. Farewell in the Lord, most beloved and
honourable brethren; such is our desire on your behalf: remember us.
