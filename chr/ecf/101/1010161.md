<span id="vi.X.IV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.IV-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—That in His Confessions He May Do
Good, He Considers Others.</span>

<span id="vi.X.IV-p2"></span>5. But for what fruit do they desire this?
Do they wish me happiness when they learn how near, by Thy gift, I come
unto Thee; and to pray for me, when they learn how much I am kept back
by my own weight? To such will I declare myself. For it is no small
fruit, O Lord my God, that by many thanks should be given to Thee on our
behalf, <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) and that by many Thou
shouldest be entreated for us. Let the fraternal soul love that in me
which Thou teachest should be loved, and lament that in me which Thou
teachest should be lamented. Let a fraternal and not an alien soul do
this, nor that “of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and
their right hand is a right hand of falsehood,” <span
id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) but that fraternal one which, when it
approves me, rejoices for me, but when it disapproves me, is sorry for
me; because whether it approves or disapproves it loves me. To such will
I declare myself; let them breathe freely at my good deeds, and sigh
over my evil ones. My good deeds are Thy institutions and Thy gifts, my
evil ones are my delinquencies and Thy judgments. <span
id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) Let them breathe freely at the one,
and sigh over the other; and let hymns and tears ascend into Thy sight
out of the fraternal hearts—Thy censers. <span
id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) And do Thou, O Lord, who takest
delight in the incense of Thy holy temple, have mercy upon me according
to Thy great mercy, <span id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) “for Thy
name’s sake;” <span id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) and on no account
leaving what Thou hast begun in me, do Thou complete what is imperfect
in me.

<span id="vi.X.IV-p9"></span>6. This is the fruit of my confessions, not
of what I was, but of what I am, that I may confess this not before Thee
only, in a secret exultation with trembling, <span
id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) and a secret sorrow with hope, but in
the ears also of the believing sons of men,—partakers of my joy, and
sharers of my mortality, my fellow-citizens and the companions of my
pilgrimage, those who are gone before, and those that are to follow
after, and the comrades of my way. These are Thy servants, my brethren,
those whom Thou wishest to be Thy sons; my masters, whom Thou hast
commanded me to serve, if I desire to live with and of Thee. But this
Thy word were little to me did it command in speaking, without going
before in acting. This then do I both in deed and word, this I do under
Thy wings, in too great danger, were it not that my soul, under Thy
wings, is subject unto Thee, and my weakness known unto Thee. I am a
little one, but my Father liveth for ever, and my Defender is
“sufficient” <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) for me. For He is
the same who begat me and who defends me; and Thou Thyself art all my
good; even Thou, the Omnipotent, who art with me, and that before I am
with Thee. To such, therefore, whom Thou commandest me to serve will I
declare, not what I was, but what I now am, and what I still am. But
neither do I judge myself. <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) Thus
then I would be heard.

<span id="vi.X.IV-p5"></span> In note 9, p. 79, we have seen how God
makes man’s sin its own punishment. Reference may also be made to
Augustin’s *Con. Advers. Leg. et Proph*. i. 14, where he argues that
“the punishment of a man’s disobedience is found in himself, when he in
his turn cannot get obedience even from himself.” And again, in his *De
Lib. Arb*. v. 18, he says, God punishes by taking from him that which he
does not use well, “et qui recte facere cum possit noluit amittat posse
cum velit.” See also *Serm.* clxxi. 4, and *Ep.* cliii.
