<span id="vi.XIII.XX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Concerning Reptiles and Flying
Creatures (Ver. 20),—The Sacrament of Baptism Being Regarded.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XX-p2"></span>26. Let the sea also conceive and bring
forth your works, and let the waters bring forth the moving creatures
that have life. <span id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) For ye, who
“take forth the precious from the vile,” <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) have been made the mouth of God,
through which He saith, “Let the waters bring forth,” not the living
creature which the earth bringeth forth, but the moving creature having
life, and the fowls that fly above the earth. For Thy sacraments, O God,
by the ministry of Thy holy ones, have made their way amid the billows
of the temptations of the world, to instruct the Gentiles in Thy Name,
in Thy Baptism. And amongst these things, many great works of wonder
have been wrought, like as great whales; and the voices of Thy
messengers flying above the earth, near to the firmament of Thy Book;
that being set over them as an authority, under which they were to fly
whithersoever they were to go. For “there is no speech, nor language,
where their voice is not heard;” seeing their sound <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) “hath gone through all the earth,
and their words to the end of the world,” because Thou, O Lord, hast
multiplied these things by blessing. <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md)

<span id="vi.XIII.XX-p7"></span>27. Whether do I lie, or do I mingle and
confound, and not distinguish between the clear knowledge of these
things that are in the firmament of heaven, and the corporeal works in
the undulating sea and under the firmament of heaven? For of those
things whereof the knowledge is solid and defined, without increase by
generation, as it were lights of wisdom and knowledge, yet of these
self-same things the material operations are many and varied; and one
thing in growing from another is multiplied by Thy blessing, O God, who
hast refreshed the fastidiousness of mortal senses; so that in the
knowledge of our mind, one thing may, through the motions of the body,
be in many ways <span id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md) set out and
expressed. These sacraments have the waters brought forth; <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md) but in Thy Word. The wants of the
people estranged from the eternity of Thy truth have produced them, but
in Thy Gospel; because the waters themselves have cast them forth, the
bitter weakness of which was the cause of these things being sent forth
in Thy Word.

<span id="vi.XIII.XX-p10"></span>28. Now all things are fair that Thou
hast made, but behold, Thou art inexpressibly fairer who hast made all
things; from whom had not Adam fallen, the saltness of the sea would
never have flowed from him,—the human race so profoundly curious, and
boisterously swelling, and restlessly moving; and thus there would be no
need that Thy dispensers should work in many waters, <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md) in a corporeal and sensible manner,
mysterious doings and sayings. For so these creeping and flying
creatures now present themselves to my mind, whereby men, instructed,
initiated, and subjected by corporeal sacraments, should not further
profit, unless their soul had a higher spiritual life, and unless, after
the word of admission, it looked forwards to perfection. <span

The word “sound” in this verse (as given in the LXX. and *Vulg.*), is in
the Hebrew <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="vi.XIII.XX-p5.2"></span>קַוָּם</span>, which is rightly rendered in
the Authorized Version a “line” or “rule.” It may be noted, in
connection with Augustin’s interpretation, that the word “firmament” in
the first verse of this psalm is the <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="vi.XIII.XX-p5.3"></span> רָקִיעַ</span> of [Gen.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.XIII.XX-p5.4"></span>;
translated in both places by the LXX. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.XIII.XX-p5.5"></span> στερέωμα</span>. The “heavens” and the
“firmament” are constantly interpreted by the Fathers as referring to
the apostles and their firmness in teaching the word: and this is
supported by reference to St. Paul’s quotation of the text in [Rom.
10.18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.XIII.XX-p5.6"></span>: “But I say, Have they not heard? Yes,
verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the
ends of the world.”

Supper, which ancients called the sacrament of perfection or
consummation.”—W. W. Compare also sec. 24, note, and p. 140, note 3,
