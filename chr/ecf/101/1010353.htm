<p class="c41"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p1.1"></A>Letter XLVI.</span></p>  
<p class="c1"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p2"></A>(<span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 398.)</p>  
<p><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p3"></A>A letter propounding several cases of conscience.</p>  
<p class="c40"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p4"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p4.1"></A>To My Beloved and Venerable Father the Bishop Augustin, Publicola Sends Greeting.</span></p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p5"></A>It is written: &#8220;Ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1662"></A><A HREF="#fn_1662"><FONT SIZE="1">1663</FONT></A>
 I have therefore judged it right to &#8220;seek the law at the mouth of the priest&#8221; in regard to a certain case which I shall state in this letter, desiring at the same time to be instructed in regard to several other matters. I have distinguished the several questions by stating each in a separate paragraph, and I beg you kindly to give an answer to each in order.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p7"></A>I. In the country of the Arzuges it is customary, as I have heard, for the barbarians to take an oath, swearing by their false gods, in the presence of the decurion stationed on the frontier or of the tribune, when they have come under engagement to carry baggage to any part, or to protect the crops from depredation; and when the decurion certifies in writing that this oath has been taken, the owners or farmers of land employ them as watchmen of their crops; or travellers who have occasion to pass through their country hire them, as if assured of their now being trustworthy. Now a doubt has arisen in my mind whether the landowner who thus employs a barbarian, of whose fidelity he is persuaded in consequence of such an oath, does not make himself and the crops committed to that man&#146;s charge to share the defilement of that sinful oath; and so also with the traveller who may employ his services. I should mention, however, that in both cases the barbarian is rewarded for his services with money. Nevertheless in both transactions there comes in, besides the pecuniary remuneration, this oath before the decurion or tribune involving mortal sin. I am concerned as to whether this sin does not defile either him who accepts the oath of the barbarian, or at least the things which are committed to the barbarian&#146;s keeping. For whatever other terms be in the arrangement, even such as the payment of gold, and giving of hostages in security, nevertheless this sinful oath has been a real part of the transaction. Be pleased to resolve my doubts definitely and positively. For if your answer indicate that you are in doubt yourself, I may fall into greater perplexity than before.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p8"></A>II. I have also heard that my own land-stewards receive from the barbarians hired to protect the crops an oath in which they appeal to their false gods. Does not this oath so defile these crops, that if a Christian uses them or takes the money realized by their sale, he is himself defiled? Do answer this.</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p9"></A>III. Again, I have heard from one person that no oath was taken by the barbarian in making agreement with my steward, but another has said to me that such an oath was taken. Suppose now that the latter statement were false, tell me if I am bound to forbear from using these crops, or the money obtained for them, merely because I have heard the statement made, according to the scriptural rule: &#8220;If any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not, for his sake that showed it.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1663"></A><A HREF="#fn_1663"><FONT SIZE="1">1664</FONT></A>
 Is this case parallel to the case of meat offered to idols; and if it is, what am I to do with the crops, or with the price of them?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p11"></A>IV. In this case ought I to examine both him who said that no oath was taken before my steward, and the other who said that the oath was taken, and bring witnesses to prove which of the two spoke truly, leaving the crops or their price untouched so long as there is uncertainty in the matter?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p12"></A>V. If the barbarian who swears this sinful oath were to require of the steward or of the tribune stationed on the frontier, that he, being a Christian, should give him assurance of his faithfulness to his part of the engagement about watching the crops, by the same oath which he <A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A> <a name="vii.1.XLVI-Page_291"></A>himself has taken, involving mortal sin, does the oath pollute only that Christian man? Does it not also pollute the things regarding which he took the oath? Or if a pagan who has authority on the frontier thus give to a barbarian this oath in token of acting faithfully to him, does he not involve in the defilement of his own sin those in whose interest he swears? If I send a man to the Arzuges, is it lawful for him to take from a barbarian that sinful oath? Is not the Christian who takes such an oath from him also defiled by his sin?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p13"></A>VI. Is it lawful for a Christian to use wheat or beans from the threshing-floor, wine or oil from the press, if, with his knowledge, some part of what has been taken thence was offered in sacrifice to a false god?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p14"></A>VII. May a Christian use for any purpose wood which he knows to have been taken from one of their idols&#146; groves?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p15"></A>VIII. If a Christian buy in the market meat which has not been offered to idols, and have in his mind conflicting doubts as to whether it has been offered to idols or not, but eventually adopt the opinion that it was not, does he sin if he partake of this meat?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p16"></A>IX. If a man does an action good in itself, about which he has some misgivings as to whether it is good or bad, can it be reckoned as a sin to him if he does it believing it to be good, although formerly he may have thought it bad?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p17"></A>X. If any one has falsely said that some meat has been offered to idols, and afterwards confess that it was a falsehood, and this confession is believed, may a Christian use the meat regarding which he heard that statement, or sell it, and use the price obtained?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p18"></A>XI. If a Christian on a journey, overpowered by want, having fasted for one, two, or several days, so that he can no longer endure the privation, should by chance, when in the last extremity of hunger, and when he sees death close at hand, find food placed in an idol&#146;s temple, where there is no man near him, and no other food to be found; whether should he die or partake of that food?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p19"></A>XII. If a Christian is on the point of being killed by a barbarian or a Roman, ought he to kill the aggressor to save his own life? or ought he even, without killing the assailant, to drive him back and fight with him, seeing it has been said, &#8220;Resist not evil&#8221;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1664"></A><A HREF="#fn_1664"><FONT SIZE="1">1665</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p21"></A>XIII. May a Christian put a wall for defence against an enemy round his property? and if some use that wall as a place from which to fight and kill the enemy, is the Christian the cause of the homicide?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p22"></A>XIV. May a Christian drink at a fountain or well into which anything from a sacrifice has been cast? May he drink from a well found in a deserted temple? If there be in a temple where an idol is worshipped a well or fountain which nothing has defiled, may he draw water thence, and drink of it?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p23"></A>XV. May a Christian use baths&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1665"></A><A HREF="#fn_1665"><FONT SIZE="1">1666</FONT></A>
 in places in which sacrifice is offered to images? May he use baths which are used by pagans on a feastday, either while they are there or after they have left?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p25"></A>XVI. May a Christian use the same sedanchair&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1666"></A><A HREF="#fn_1666"><FONT SIZE="1">1667</FONT></A>
 as has been used by pagans coming down from their idols on a feastday, if in that chair they have performed any part of their idolatrous service, and the Christian is aware of this?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p27"></A>XVII. If a Christian, being the guest of another, has forborne from using meat set before him, concerning which it was said to him that it had been offered in sacrifice, but afterwards by some accident finds the same meat for sale and buys it, or has it presented to him at another man&#146;s table, and then eat of it, without knowing that it is the same, is he guilty of sin?</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p28"></A>XVIII. May a Christian buy and use vegetables or fruit which he knows to have been brought from the garden of a temple or of the priests of an idol? That you may not be put to trouble in searching the Scriptures concerning the oath of which I have spoken and the idols, I resolved to set before you those texts which, by the Lord&#146;s help, I have found; but if you have found anything better or more to the purpose in Scripture, be so good as let me know. For example, when Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor judge betwixt us,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1667"></A><A HREF="#fn_1667"><FONT SIZE="1">1668</FONT></A>
 Scripture does not declare which god is meant. Again, when Abimelech came to Isaac, and he and those who were with him sware to Isaac, we are not told what kind of oath it was.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1668"></A><A HREF="#fn_1668"><FONT SIZE="1">1669</FONT></A>
 As to the idols, Gideon was commanded by the Lord to make a whole burnt-offering of the bullock which he killed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1669"></A><A HREF="#fn_1669"><FONT SIZE="1">1670</FONT></A>
 And in the book of Joshua the son of Nun, it is said of Jericho that all the silver, and gold, and brass should be brought into the treasures of the Lord, and the things found in the accursed city were called sacred.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1670"></A><A HREF="#fn_1670"><FONT SIZE="1">1671</FONT></A>
 Also we read in Deuteronomy:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1671"></A><A HREF="#fn_1671"><FONT SIZE="1">1672</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="vii.1.XLVI-p34"></A>May the Lord preserve thee. I salute thee. Pray for me.</p>
