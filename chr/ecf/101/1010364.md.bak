<span id="vii.1.LVIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LVIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.)

<span id="vii.1.LVIII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LVIII-p3.1"></span>To My Noble and Worthy Lord Pammachius, My
Son, Dearly Beloved in the Bowels of Christ, Augustin Sends Greeting in
the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LVIII-p4"></span>1. The good works which spring from the
grace of Christ in you have given you a claim to be esteemed by us His
members, and have made you as truly known and as much beloved by us as
you could be. For even were I daily seeing your face, this could add
nothing to the completeness of the acquaintance with you which I now
have, when in the shining light of one of your actions I have seen your
inner being, fair with the loveliness of peace, and beaming with the
brightness of truth. Seeing this has made me know you, and knowing you
has made me love you; and therefore, in addressing you, I write to one
who, notwithstanding our distance from each other, has become known to
me, and is my beloved friend. The bond which binds us together is indeed
of earlier date, and we were living united under One Head: for had you
not been rooted in His love, the Catholic unity would not have been so
dear to you, and you would not have dealt as you have done with your
African tenants <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) settled in
the midst of the consular province of Numidia, the very country in which
the folly of the Donatists began, addressing them in such terms, and
encouraging them with such enthusiasm, as to persuade them with
unhesitating devotion to choose that course which they believed that a
man of your character and position would not adopt on other grounds than
truth ascertained and acknowledged, and to submit themselves, though so
remote from you, to the same Head; so that along with yourself they are
reckoned for ever as members of Him by whose command they are for the
time dependent upon you.

<span id="vii.1.LVIII-p6"></span>2. Embracing you, therefore, as known
to me by this transaction, I am moved by joyful feelings to congratulate
you in Christ Jesus our Lord, and to send you this letter as a proof of
my heart’s love towards you; for I cannot do more. I beseech you,
however, not to measure the amount of my love by this letter; but by
means of this letter, when you have read it, pass on by the unseen inner
passage which thought opens up into my heart, and see what is there felt
towards you. For to the eye of love that sanctuary of love shall be
unveiled which we shut against the disquieting trifles of this world
when there we worship God; and there you will see the ecstasy of my joy
in your good work, an ecstasy which I cannot describe with tongue or
pen, glowing and burning in the offering of praise to Him by whose
inspiration you were made willing, and by whose help you were made able
to serve Him in this way. “Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable
gift!” <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md)

<span id="vii.1.LVIII-p8"></span>3. Oh how we desire in Africa to see
such work as this by which you have gladdened us done by many, who are,
like yourself, senators in the State, and sons of the holy Church! It
<span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="vii.1.LVIII-Page_317"></span>is, however, hazardous to give them
this exhortation: they may refuse to follow it, and the enemies of the
Church will take advantage of this to deceive the weak, as if they had
gained a victory over us in the minds of those who disregarded our
counsel. But it is safe for me to express gratitude to you; for you have
already done that by which, in the emancipation of those who were weak,
the enemies of the Church are confounded. I have therefore thought it
sufficient to ask you to read this letter with friendly boldness to any
to whom you can do so on the ground of their Christian profession. For
thus learning what you have achieved, they will believe that that, about
which as an impossibility they are now indifferent, can be done in
Africa. As to the snares which these heretics contrive in the perversity
of their hearts, I have resolved not to speak of them in this letter,
because I have been only amused at their imagining that they could gain
any advantage over your mind, which Christ holds as His possession. You
will hear them, however, from my brethren, whom I earnestly commend to
your Excellency: they fear lest you should disdain some things which to
you might seem unnecessary in connection with the great and unlooked for
salvation of those men over whom, in consequence of your work, their
Catholic Mother rejoices.
