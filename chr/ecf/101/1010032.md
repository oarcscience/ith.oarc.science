<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.I_1.XVI-p2.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—He Disapproves of the Mode of
Educating Youth, and He Points Out Why Wickedness is Attributed to the
Gods by the Poets.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p3"></span>25. But woe unto thee, thou stream of
human custom! Who shall stay thy course? How long shall it be before
thou art dried up? How long wilt thou carry down the sons of Eve into
that huge and formidable ocean, which even they who are embarked on the
cross (*lignum*) can scarce pass over? <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171) Do I not read in thee of Jove the
thunderer and adulterer? And the two verily he could not be; but it was
that, while the fictitious thunder served as a cloak, he might have
warrant to imitate real adultery. Yet which of our gowned masters can
lend a temperate ear to a man of his school who cries out and says:
“These were Homer’s fictions; he transfers things human to the gods. I
could have wished him to transfer divine things to us.” <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172) But it would have been more true had
he said: “These are, indeed, his fictions, but he attributed divine
attributes to sinful men, that crimes might not be accounted crimes, and
that whosoever committed any might appear to imitate the celestial gods
and not abandoned men.”

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p6"></span>26. And yet, thou stream of hell, into
thee are cast the sons of men, with rewards for learning these things;
and much is made of it when this is going on in the forum in the sight
of laws which grant a salary over and above the rewards. And thou
beatest against thy rocks and roarest, saying, “Hence words are learnt;
hence eloquence is to be attained, most necessary to persuade people to
your way of thinking, and to unfold your opinions.” So, in truth, we
should never have understood these words, “golden shower,” “bosom,”
“intrigue,” “highest heavens,” and other words written in the same
place, unless Terence had introduced a good-for-nothing youth upon the
stage, setting up Jove as his example of lewdness:—

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p7"></span>“Viewing a picture, where the tale was
drawn,

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p8"></span>Of Jove’s descending in a golden shower

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p9"></span>To Danaë’s bosom . . . with a woman to
intrigue.”

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p10"></span>And see how he excites himself to lust,
as if by celestial authority, when he says:—

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p11"></span><span id="page_53">p. 53</span> <span
id="vi.I_1.XVI-Page_53"></span>“Great Jove,

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p12"></span>Who shakes the highest heavens with his
thunder,

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p13"></span>And I, poor mortal man, not do the
same!

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p14"></span>I did it, and with all my heart I did
it.” <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173)

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p16"></span>Not one whit more easily are the words
learnt for this vileness, but by their means is the vileness perpetrated
with more confidence. I do not blame the words, they being, as it were,
choice and precious vessels, but the wine of error which was drunk in
them to us by inebriated teachers; and unless we drank, we were beaten,
without liberty of appeal to any sober judge. And yet, O my God,—in
whose presence I can now with security recall this,—did I, unhappy one,
learn these things willingly, and with delight, and for this was I
called a boy of good promise. <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174)

<span id="vi.I_1.XVI-p4"></span> So in Tract. II. on John, he has: “The
sea has to be crossed, and dost thou despise *the wood?*” explaining it
to mean the cross of Christ. And again: “Thou art not at all able to
walk in the sea, be carried by a ship—be carried by *the wood*—believe
on the Crucified,” etc.

was recited at “the play” of at least one of our public schools. See *De
Civ. Dei*, ii. secs. 7, 8, where Augustin again alludes to this matter.
