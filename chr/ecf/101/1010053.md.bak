<span id="vi.III.VII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.III.VII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—He Attacks the Doctrine of the
Manichæans Concerning Evil, God, and the Righteousness of the
Patriarchs.</span>

<span id="vi.III.VII-p2"></span>12. For I was ignorant as to that which
really is, and was, as it were, violently moved to give <span
id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span id="vi.III.VII-Page_64"></span>my
support to foolish deceivers, when they asked me, “Whence is
evil?” <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) —and, “Is God limited by
a bodily shape, and has He hairs and nails?”—and, “Are they to be
esteemed righteous who had many wives at once and did kill men, and
sacrificed living creatures?” <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) At
which things I, in my ignorance, was much disturbed, and, retreating
from the truth, I appeared to myself to be going towards it; because as
yet I knew not that evil was naught but a privation of good, until in
the end it ceases altogether to be; which how should I see, the sight of
whose eyes saw no further than bodies, and of my mind no further than a
phantasm? And I knew not God to be a Spirit, <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) not one who hath parts extended in
length and breadth, nor whose being was bulk; for every bulk is less in
a part than in the whole, and, if it be infinite, it must be less in
such part as is limited by a certain space than in its infinity; and
cannot be wholly everywhere, as Spirit, as God is. And what that should
be in us, by which we were like unto God, and might rightly in Scripture
be said to be after “the image of God,” <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) I was entirely ignorant.

<span id="vi.III.VII-p7"></span>13. Nor had I knowledge of that true
inner righteousness, which doth not judge according to custom, but out
of the most perfect law of God Almighty, by which the manners of places
and times were adapted to those places and times—being itself the while
the same always and everywhere, not one thing in one place, and another
in another; according to which Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses,
and David, and all those commended by the mouth of God were
righteous, <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) but were judged
unrighteous by foolish men, judging out of man’s judgment, <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) and gauging by the petty standard of
their own manners the manners of the whole human race. Like as if in an
armoury, one knowing not what were adapted to the several members should
put greaves on his head, or boot himself with a helmet, and then
complain because they would not fit. Or as if, on some day when in the
afternoon business was forbidden, one were to fume at not being allowed
to sell as it was lawful to him in the forenoon. Or when in some house
he sees a servant take something in his hand which the butler is not
permitted to touch, or something done behind a stable which would be
prohibited in the dining-room, and should be indignant that in one
house, and one family, the same thing is not distributed everywhere to
all. Such are they who cannot endure to hear something to have been
lawful for righteous men in former times which is not so now; or that
God, for certain temporal reasons, commanded them one thing, and these
another, but both obeying the same righteousness; though they see, in
one man, one day, and one house, different things to be fit for
different members, and a thing which was formerly lawful after a time
unlawful—that permitted or commanded in one corner, which done in
another is justly prohibited and punished. Is justice, then, various and
changeable? Nay, but the times over which she presides are not all
alike, because they are times. <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md)
But men, whose days upon the earth are few, <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) because by their own perception they
cannot harmonize the causes of former ages and other nations, of which
they had no experience, with these of which they have experience, though
in one and the same body, day, or family, they can readily see what is
suitable for each member, season, part, and person—to the one they take
exception, to the other they submit.

<span id="vi.III.VII-p12"></span>14. These things I then knew not, nor
observed. They met my eyes on every side, and I saw them not. I composed
poems, in which it was not permitted me to place every foot everywhere,
but in one metre one way, and in another, nor even in any one verse the
same foot in all places. Yet the art itself by which I composed had not
different principles for these different cases, but comprised all in
one. Still I saw not how that righteousness, which good and holy men
submitted to, far more excellently and sublimely comprehended in one all
those things which God commanded, <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="vi.III.VII-Page_65"></span>and in no part varied, though in varying
times it did not prescribe all things at once, but distributed and
enjoined what was proper for each. And I, being blind, blamed those
pious fathers, not only for making use of present things as God
commanded and inspired them to do, but also for foreshowing things to
come as God was revealing them. <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md)

<span id="vi.III.VII-p3"></span> The strange mixture of the pensive
philosophy of Persia with Gnosticism and Christianity, propounded by
Manichæus, attempted to solve this question, which was “the great object
of heretical inquiry” (Mansel’s *Gnostics*, lec. i.). It was Augustin’s
desire for knowledge concerning it that united him to this sect, and
which also led him to forsake it, when he found therein nothing but
empty fables (*De Lib. Arb*. i. sec. 4). Manichæus taught that evil and
good were primeval, and had independent existences. Augustin, on the
other hand, maintains that it was not possible for evil so to exist (*De
Civ. Dei*, xi. sec. 22) but, as he here states, evil is “a privation of
good.” The evil will has a *causa deficiens*, but not a *causa
efficiens* (*ibid*. xii. 6), as is exemplified in the fall of the
angels.

<span id="vi.III.VII-p10"></span> The law of the development of
revelation implied in the above passage is one to which Augustin
frequently resorts in confutation of objections such as those to which
he refers in the previous and following sections. It may likewise be
effectively used when similar objections are raised by modern sceptics.
In the Rabbinical books there is a tradition of the wanderings of the
children of Israel, that not only did their clothes not wax old ([Deut.
29.5](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.III.VII-p10.1"></span>) during those forty years, but that they
*grew* with their growth. The written word is as it were the
swaddling-clothes of the holy child Jesus; and as the revelation
concerning Him—the Word Incarnate—grew, did the written word grow. God
spoke in sundry parts \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.III.VII-p10.2"></span>πολυέμρως</span>\] and in divers manners
unto the fathers by the prophets ([Heb.
1.1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.III.VII-p10.3"></span>); but when the “fulness of the time was
come” ([Gal. 4.4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.III.VII-p10.4"></span>), He completed the revelation in His Son.
Our Lord indicates this principle when He speaks of divorce in [Matt.
19.8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.III.VII-p10.5"></span>. “Moses,” he says, “because of the
hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives; but from
the beginning it was not so.” (See *Con. Faust*. xix. 26, 29.) When
objections, then, as to obsolete ritual usages, or the sins committed by
Old Testament worthies are urged, the answer is plain: the ritual has
become obsolete, because only intended for the infancy of revelation,
and the sins, while recorded in, are not approved by Scripture, and
those who committed them will be judged according to the measure of
revelation they received. See also *De Ver. Relig.* xvii.; *in Ps.*
lxxiii. 1, liv. 22; *Con. Faust*. xxii. 25; Trench, *Hulsean Lecs.* iv.,
v. (1845); and Candlish’s *Reason and Revelation*, pp. 58–75.

<span id="vi.III.VII-p11"></span> [Job

<span id="fn_248"></span>[65:249](1010053.htm#fr_248.md) <span
id="vi.III.VII-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.III.VII-p13"></span> Here, as at the end of sec. 17, he
alludes to the typical and allegorical character of Old Testament
histories. Though he does not with Origen go so far as to disparage the
letter of Scripture (see *De Civ. Dei*, xiii. 21), but upholds it, he
constantly employs the allegorical principle. He (alluding to the
patriarchs) goes so far, indeed, as to say (*Con.* *Faust.*, xxii. 24),
that “not only the speech but the life of these men was prophetic; and
the whole kingdom of the Hebrews was like a great prophet;” and again:
“We may discover a prophecy of the coming of Christ and of the Church
both in what they said and what they did”. This method of interpretation
he first learned from Ambrose. See note on “the letter killeth,” etc.
(below, vi. sec. 6), for the danger attending it. On the general
subject, reference may also be made to his *in Ps.* cxxxvi. 3; *Serm.*
2; *De Tentat. Abr*. sec. 7; and *De Civ. Dei*, xvii. 3.
