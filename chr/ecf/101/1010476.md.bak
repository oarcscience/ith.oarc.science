<span id="vii.1.CCLXIX-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCLXIX-p2.1"></span>To Nobilius, My Most Blessed and Venerable
Brother and Partner in the Priestly Office, Augustin Sends
Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIX-p3"></span>So important is the solemnity at which
your brotherly affection invites me to be present, that my heart’s
desire would carry my poor body to you, were it not that infirmity
renders this impossible. I might have come if it had not been winter; I
might have braved the winter if I had been young: for in the latter case
the warmth of youth would have borne uncomplainingly the cold of the
season; in the former case the warmth of summer would have met with
gentleness the chill languor of old age. For the present, my lord most
blessed, my holy and venerable partner in the priestly office, I cannot
undertake in winter so long a journey, carrying with me as I must the
frigid feebleness of very many years. I reciprocate the salutation due
to your worth, on behalf of my own welfare I ask an interest in your
prayers, and I myself beseech the Lord God to grant that the prosperity
of peace may follow the dedication of so great an edifice to His sacred
service. <span id="fr_3033"></span>[3034](#fn_3033.md)

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIX-p4"></span> This letter, probably one of the
latest from the pen of Augustin, is the last of his letters in the
Benedictine edition; the only remaining one, the 270th, was not written
by Augustin, but addressed to him by an unknown correspondent.
