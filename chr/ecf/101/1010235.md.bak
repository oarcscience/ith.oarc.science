<span id="vi.XII.II-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.II-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Of the Double Heaven,—The
Visible, and the Heaven of Heavens.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.II-p2"></span>2. The weakness of my tongue confesseth
unto Thy Highness, seeing that Thou madest heaven and earth. This heaven
which I see, and this earth upon which I tread (from which is this earth
that I carry about me), Thou hast made. But where is that heaven of
heavens, <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) O Lord, of which we
hear in the words of the Psalm, The heaven of heavens are the Lord’s,
but the earth hath He given to the children of men? <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) Where is the heaven, which we
behold not, in comparison of which all this, which we behold, is earth?
For this corporeal whole, not as a whole everywhere, hath thus received
its beautiful figure in these lower parts, of which the bottom is our
earth; but compared with that heaven of heavens, even the heaven of our
earth is but earth; yea, each of these great bodies is not absurdly
called earth, as compared with that, I know not what manner of heaven,
which is the Lord’s, not the sons’ of men.

<span id="vi.XII.II-p3"></span> That is, not the atmosphere which
surrounds the earth, as when we say, “the birds of heaven” ([Jer.
4.25](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.XII.II-p3.1"></span>), “the dew of heaven” ([Gen.
27.28](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.XII.II-p3.2"></span>); nor that “firmament of heaven” ([Gen.
1.17](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#017)<span id="vi.XII.II-p3.3"></span>.md)
in which the stars have their courses; nor both these together; but that
“third heaven” to which Paul was “caught up” ([2 Cor.
12.1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001)<span id="vi.XII.II-p3.4"></span>.md)
in his rapture, and where God most manifests His glory, and the angels
do Him homage.
