<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p1.1"></span>Fourth Division.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p2"></span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p3"></span>\[Hitherto the order followed in the
arrangement of the letters has been the chronological. It being
impossible to ascertain definitely the date of composition of
thirty-nine of the letters, these have been placed by the Benedictine
editors in the fourth division, and in it they are arranged under two
principal divisions, the first embracing some controversial letters, and
the second a number of those which were occasioned either by Augustin’s
interest in the welfare of individuals, or by the claims of official
duty.\]

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p5"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p5.1"></span>Letter CCXXXII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p6.1"></span>To the People of Madaura, My Lords Worthy
of Praise, and Brethren Most Beloved, Augustin Sends Greeting, in Reply
to the Letter Received by the Hands of Brother Florentinus.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p7"></span>1. If, perchance, such a letter as I
have received was sent to me by those among you who are Catholic
Christians, the only thing at which I am surprised is, that it was sent
in the name of the municipality, and not in their own name. If, however,
it has pleased all or almost all of your men of rank to send a letter to
me, I am surprised at the title “Father” and the “salutation in the
Lord” addressed to me by you, of whom I know certainly, and with much
regret, that you regard with superstitious veneration those idols
against which your temples are more easily shut than your hearts; or, I
should rather say, those idols which are not more truly shut up in your
temples than in your hearts. <span id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006.md)
Can it be that you are at last, after wise reflection, seriously
thinking of that salvation which is in the Lord, in whose name you have
chosen to salute me? For if it be not so, I ask you, my lords worthy of
all praise, and brethren most beloved, in what have I injured, in what
have I offended your benevolence, that you should think it right to
treat me with ridicule rather than with respect in the salutation
prefixed to your letter?

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p9"></span>2. For when I read the words, “To
Father Augustin, eternal salvation in the Lord,” I was suddenly elated
with such fulness of hope, that I believed you either already converted
to the Lord Himself, and to that eternal salvation of which He is the
author, or desirous, through our ministry, to be so converted. But when
I read the rest of the letter my heart was chilled. I inquired, however,
from the bearer of the letter, whether you were already Christians or
were desirous to be so. After I learned from his answer that you were in
no way changed, I was deeply grieved that you thought it right not only
to reject the name of Christ, to whom you already see the whole world
submitting, but even to insult His name in my person; for I could not
think of any other Lord than Christ the Lord in whom a bishop could be
addressed by you as a father, and if there had been any doubt as to the
meaning to be attached to your words, it would have been removed by the
closing sentence of your letter, where you say plainly, “We desire that,
for many years, your lordship may always, in the midst of your clergy,
be glad in God and His Christ.” After reading and pondering all these
things, what could I (or, indeed, could any man) think but that these
words were written either as the genuine expression of the mind of the
writers, or with an intention to deceive? If you write these things as
the genuine expression of your mind, who has barred your way to the
truth? Who has strewn it with thorns? What enemy has placed masses of
rock across your path? In fine, if you are desiring to come in, who has
shut the door of our places of worship against you, so that you are
unwilling to enjoy the same salvation with us in the same Lord in whose
name you salute us? But if you write these things deceitfully and
mockingly, do you, then, in the very act of imposing on me the care of
your affairs, presume to insult, with the language of feigned adulation,
the name of Him through whom alone I can do anything, instead of
honouring Him with the veneration which is due to Him?

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p10"></span>3. Be assured, dearest brethren,
that it is with inexpressible trembling of heart on your account that I
write this letter to you, for I know how much greater in the judgment of
God must be your guilt and your doom if I shall have said these things
to you in vain. In regard to everything in the history of the human race
which our forefathers observed and handed down to us, and not less in
regard to everything connected with the seeking and holding of true
religion which we now see and put on record for those who come after us,
the Divine Scriptures have not been silent; so far from this, all things
come to pass exactly according to the predictions of Scripture. You
cannot deny that you see the Jewish people torn from the abodes of their
ancestry, dispersed and scattered over almost every country: now, the
origin of that people, their gradual increase, their losing of the
kingdom, <span id="page_586">p. 586</span> <span
id="vii.1.CCXXXII-Page_586"></span>their dispersion through all the
world, have happened exactly as foretold. You cannot deny that you see
that the word of the Lord, and the law coming forth from that people
through Christ, who was miraculously born among their nation, has taken
and retained possession of the faith of all nations: now we read of all
these announced beforehand as we see them. You cannot deny that you see
what we call heresies and schisms, that is, many cut off from the root
of the Christian society, which by means of the Apostolic Sees, and the
successions of bishops, is spread abroad in an indisputably world-wide
diffusion, claiming the name of Christians, and as withering branches
boasting of the mere appearance of being derived from the true vine: all
this has been foreseen, predicted, and described in Scripture. You
cannot deny that you see some temples of the idols fallen into ruin
through neglect, others thrown down by violence, others closed, and some
applied to other purposes; you see the idols themselves either broken to
pieces, or burnt, or shut up, or destroyed, and the same powers of this
world, who in defence of idols persecuted Christians, now vanquished and
subdued by Christians, who did not fight for the truth but died for it,
and directing their attacks and their laws against the very idols in
defence of which they put Christians to death, and the highest dignitary
of the noblest empire laying aside his crown and kneeling as a suppliant
at the tomb of the fisherman Peter.

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p11"></span>4. The Divine Scriptures, which have
now come into the hands of all, testified long before that all these
things would come to pass. We rejoice that all these things have
happened, with a faith which is strong in proportion to the discovery
thereby made of the greatness of the authority with which they are
declared in the sacred Scriptures. Seeing, then, that all these things
have come to pass as foretold, are we, I ask, to suppose that the
judgment of God, which we read of in the same Scriptures as appointed to
separate finally between the believing and the unbelieving, is the only
event in regard to which the prophecy is to fail? Yea, certainly, as all
these events have come, it shall also come. Nor shall there be a man of
our time who shall be able in that day to plead anything in defence of
his unbelief. For the name of Christ is on the lips of every man: it is
invoked by the just man in doing justice, by the perjurer in the act of
deceiving, by the king to confirm his rule, by the soldier to nerve
himself for battle, by the husband to establish his authority, by the
wife to confess her submission, by the father to enforce his command, by
the son to declare his obedience, by the master in supporting his right
to govern, by the slave in performing his duty, by the humble in
quickening piety, by the proud in stimulating ambition, by the rich man
when he gives, and by the poor when he receives an alms, by the drunkard
at his wine-cup, by the beggar at the gate, by the good man in keeping
his word, by the wicked man in violating his promises: all frequently
use the name of Christ, the Christian with genuine reverence, the Pagan
with feigned respect; and they shall undoubtedly give to that same Being
whom they invoke an account both of the spirit and of the language in
which they repeat His name.

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p12"></span>5. There is One invisible, from
whom, as the Creator and First Cause, all things seen by us derive their
being: He is supreme, eternal, unchangeable, and comprehensible by none
save Himself alone. There is One by whom the supreme Majesty utters and
reveals Himself, namely, the Word, not inferior to Him by whom it is
begotten and uttered, by which Word He who begets it is manifested.
There is One who is holiness, the sanctifier of all that becomes holy,
who is the inseparable and undivided mutual communion between this
unchangeable Word by whom that First Cause is revealed, and that First
Cause who reveals Himself by the Word which is His equal. But who is
able with perfectly calm and pure mind to contemplate this whole Essence
(whom I have endeavoured to describe without giving His name, instead of
giving His name without describing Him), and to draw blessedness from
that contemplation, and by sinking, as it were, in the rapture of such
meditation, to become oblivious of self, and to press on to that the
sight of which is beyond our sphere of perception; in other words, to be
clothed with immortality, and obtain that eternal salvation which you
were pleased to desire on my behalf in your greeting? Who, I say, is
able to do this but the man who, confessing his sins, shall have
levelled with the dust all the vain risings of pride, and prostrated
himself in meekness and humility to receive God as his Teacher?

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p13"></span>6. Since, therefore, it is necessary
that we be first brought down from vain self-sufficiency to lowliness of
spirit, that rising thence we may attain to real exaltation, it was not
possible that this spirit could be produced in us by any method at once
more glorious and more gentle (subduing our haughtiness by persuasion
instead of violence) than that the Word by whom the Father reveals
Himself to angels, who is His Power and Wisdom, who could not be
discerned by the human heart so long as it was blinded by love for the
things which are seen, should condescend to assume our nature, and so to
exercise and manifest His personality when incarnate as to make men more
afraid of being elated by the pride of man, than of being brought low
after the example of God. Therefore the Christ who is preached
throughout the whole world is not <span id="page_587">p. 587</span>
<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-Page_587"></span>Christ adorned with an earthly
crown, nor Christ rich in earthly treasures, nor Christ illustrious for
earthly prosperity, but Christ crucified. This was ridiculed, at first,
by whole nations of proud men, and is still ridiculed by a remnant among
the nations, but it was the object of faith at first to a few and now to
whole nations, because when Christ crucified was preached at that time,
notwithstanding the ridicule of the nations, to the few who believed,
the lame received power to walk, the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear,
the blind to see, and the dead were restored to life. Thus, at length,
the pride of this world was convinced that, even among the things of
this world, there is nothing more powerful than the humility of
God, <span id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007.md) so that beneath the
shield of a divine example that humility, which it is most profitable
for men to practise, might find defence against the contemptuous
assaults of pride.

<span id="vii.1.CCXXXII-p15"></span>7. O men of Madaura, my brethren,
nay, my fathers, <span id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md) I beseech
you to awake at last: this opportunity of writing to you God has given
to me. So far as I could, I rendered my service and help in the business
of brother Florentinus, by whom, as God willed it, you wrote to me; but
the business was of such a nature, that even without my assistance it
might have been easily transacted, for almost all the men of his family,
who reside at Hippo, know Florentinus, and deeply regret his
bereavement. But the letter was sent by you to me, that, having occasion
to reply, it might not seem presumptuous on my part, when the
opportunity was afforded me by yourselves, to say something concerning
Christ to the worshippers of idols. But I beseech you, if you have not
taken His name in vain in that epistle, suffer not these things which I
write to you to be in vain; but if in using His name you wished to mock
me, fear Him whom the world formerly in its pride scorned as a condemned
criminal, and whom the same world now, subjected to His sway, awaits as
its Judge. For the desire of my heart for you, expressed as far as in my
power by this letter, shall witness against you at the judgment-seat of
Him who shall establish for ever those who believe in Him and confound
the unbelieving. May the one true God deliver you wholly from the vanity
of this world, and turn you to Himself, my lords worthy of all praise
and brethren most beloved.
