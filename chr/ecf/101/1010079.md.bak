<span id="vi.V.III-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.V.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Having Heard Faustus, the Most
Learned Bishop of the Manichæans, He Discerns that God, the Author Both
of Things Animate and Inanimate, Chiefly Has Care for the Humble.</span>

<span id="vi.V.III-p2"></span>3. Let me lay bare before my God that
twenty-ninth year of my age. There had at this time come to Carthage a
certain bishop of the Manichæans, by name Faustus, a great snare of the
devil, and in any were entangled by him through the allurement of his
smooth speech; the which, although I did commend, yet could I separate
from the truth of those things which I was eager to learn. Nor did I
esteem the small dish of oratory so much as the science, which this
their so praised Faustus placed before me to feed upon. Fame, indeed,
had before spoken of him to me, as most skilled in all becoming
learning, and pre-eminently skilled in the liberal sciences. And as I
had read and retained in memory many injunctions of the philosophers, I
used to compare some teachings of theirs with those long fables of the
Manichæans and the former things which they declared, who could only
prevail so far as to estimate this lower world, while its lord they
could by no means find out, <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md)
seemed to me the more probable. For Thou art great, O Lord, and hast
respect unto the lowly, but the proud Thou knowest afar off.” <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) Nor dost Thou draw near but to the
contrite heart, <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) nor art Thou
found by the proud, <span id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) —not even
could they number by cunning skill the stars and the sand, and measure
the starry regions, and trace the courses of the planets.

<span id="vi.V.III-p7"></span>4. For with their understanding and the
capacity which Thou hast bestowed upon them they search out these
things; and much have they found out, and foretold many years
before,—the eclipses of those luminaries, the sun and moon, on what day,
at what hour, and from how many particular points they were likely to
come. Nor did their calculation fail them; and it came to pass even as
they foretold. And they wrote down the rules found out, which are read
at this day; and from these others foretell in what year and in what
month of the year, and on what day of the month, and at what hour of the
day, and at what quarter of its light, either moon or sun is to be
eclipsed, and thus it shall be even as it is foretold. And men who are
ignorant of these things marvel and are amazed, and they that know them
exult and are exalted; and by an impious pride, departing from Thee, and
forsaking Thy light, they foretell a failure of the sun’s light which is
likely to occur so long before, but see not their own, which is now
present. For they seek not religiously whence they have the ability
where-with they seek out these things. And finding that Thou hast made
them, they give not themselves up to Thee, that Thou mayest preserve
what Thou hast made, nor sacrifice themselves to Thee, even such as they
have made themselves to be; nor do they slay their own pride, as fowls
of the air, <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) nor their own
curiosities, by which (like the fishes of the sea) they wander over the
unknown paths of the abyss, nor their own extravagance, as the “beasts
of the field,” <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) that Thou, Lord,
“a consuming fire,” <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) mayest burn
up their lifeless cares and renew them immortally.

<span id="vi.V.III-p11"></span>5. But the way—Thy Word, <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) by whom Thou didst make these things
which they number, and themselves who number, and the sense by which
they perceive what they number, and the judgment out of which they
number—they knew not, and that of Thy wisdom there is no number. <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) But the Only-begotten has been “made
unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,” <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) and has been numbered amongst us, and
paid tribute to Cæsar. <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) This way,
by which they might descend to Him from themselves, they knew not; nor
that through Him they might ascend unto Him. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) This way they knew not, and they think
themselves exalted with the stars <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) and shining, and lo! they fell upon
the earth, <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) and “their foolish
heart <span id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span
id="vi.V.III-Page_81"></span>was darkened.” <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) They say many true things concerning
the creature; but Truth, the Artificer of the creature, they seek not
with devotion, and hence they find Him not. Or if they find Him, knowing
that He is God, they glorify Him not as God, neither are they
thankful, <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) but become vain in
their imaginations, and say that they themselves are wise, <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) attributing to themselves what is
Thine; and by this, with most perverse blindness, they desire to impute
to Thee what is their own, forging lies against Thee who art the Truth,
and changing the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like
corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping
things, <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md) —changing Thy truth into
a lie, and worshipping and serving the creature more than the
Creator. <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md)

<span id="vi.V.III-p24"></span>6. Many truths, however, concerning the
creature did I retain from these men, and the cause appeared to me from
calculations, the succession of seasons, and the visible manifestations
of the stars; and I compared them with the sayings of Manichæus, who in
his frenzy has written most extensively on these subjects, but
discovered not any account either of the solstices, or the equinoxes,
the eclipses of the luminaries, or anything of the kind I had learned in
the books of secular philosophy. But therein I was ordered to believe,
and yet it corresponded not with those rules acknowledged by calculation
and my own sight, but was far different.
