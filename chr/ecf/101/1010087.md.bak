<span id="vi.V.XI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.V.XI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Helpidius Disputed Well Against the
Manichæans as to the Authenticity of the New Testament.</span>

<span id="vi.V.XI-p2"></span>21. Furthermore, whatever they had
censured <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) in Thy Scriptures I
thought impossible to be defended; and yet sometimes, indeed, I desired
to confer on these several points with some one well learned in those
books, and to try what he thought of them. For at this time the words of
one Helpidius, speaking and disputing face to face against the said
Manichæans, had begun to move me even at Carthage, in that he brought
forth things from the Scriptures not easily withstood, to which their
answer appeared to me feeble. And this answer they did not give forth
publicly, but only to us in private,—when they said that the writings of
the New Testament had been tampered with by I know not whom, who were
desirous of ingrafting the Jewish law upon the Christian faith; <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) but they themselves did not bring
forward any uncorrupted copies. <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md)
But I, thinking of corporeal things, very much ensnared and in a measure
stifled, was oppressed by those masses; <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) panting under which for the breath of
Thy Truth, I was not able to breathe it pure and undefiled.

<span id="vi.V.XI-p5"></span> They might well not like to give the
answer in public, for, as Augustin remarks (*De Mor.* *Eccles. Cath.*
sec. 14), every one could see “that this is all that is left for men to
say when it is proved that they are wrong. The astonishment that he
experienced now, that they did “not bring forward any uncorrupted
copies,” had fast hold of him, and after his conversion he confronted
them on this very ground. “You ought to bring forward,” he says (*ibid.*
sec. 61), “another manuscript with the same contents, but incorrupt and
more correct, with only the passage wanting which you charge with being
spurious.…You say you will not, lest you be suspected of corrupting it.
This is your usual reply, and a true one.” See also *De Mor. Manich.*
sec. 55; and *Con. Faust.* xi. 2, xiii. 5, xviii. 7, xxii. 15, xxxii.
16.
