id="vi.XI.XXVI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—We Measure Longer Events by
Shorter in Time.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XXVI-p2"></span>33. Doth not my soul pour out unto Thee
truly in confession that I do measure times? But do I thus measure, O my
God, and know not what I measure? I measure the motion of a body by
time; and the time itself do I not measure? But, in truth, could I
measure the motion of a body, how long it is, and how long it is in
coming from this place to that, unless I should measure the time in
which it is moved? How, therefore, do I measure this very time itself?
Or do we by a shorter time measure a longer, as by the space of a cubit
the space of a crossbeam? For thus, indeed, we seem by the space of a
short syllable to measure the space of a long syllable, and to say that
this is double. Thus we measure the spaces of stanzas by the spaces of
the verses, and the spaces of the verses by the spaces of the feet, and
the spaces of the feet by the spaces of the syllables, and the spaces of
long by the spaces of short syllables; not measuring by pages (for in
that manner we measure spaces, not times), but when in uttering the
words they pass by, and we say, “It is a long stanza because it is made
up of so many verses; long verses, because they consist of so many feet;
long feet, because they are prolonged by so many syllables; a long
syllable, because double a short one.” But neither thus is any certain
measure of time obtained; since it is possible that a shorter verse, if
it be pronounced more fully, may take up more time than a longer one, if
pronounced more hurriedly. Thus for a stanzas, thus for a foot, thus for
a syllable. Whence it appeared to me that time is nothing else than
protraction; but of what I know not. It is wonderful to me, if it be not
of the mind itself. For what do I measure, I beseech Thee, O my God,
even when I say either indefinitely, “This time is longer than that;” or
even definitely, “This is double that?” That I measure time, I know. But
I measure not the future, for it is not yet; nor do I measure the
present, because it is extended by no space; nor do I measure the past,
because it no longer is. What, therefore, do I measure? Is it times
passing, not past? For thus had I said.
