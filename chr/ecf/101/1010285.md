<span id="vi.XIII.XIX-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XIX-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—All Men Should Become Lights
in the Firmament of Heaven.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XIX-p2"></span>24. But first, “Wash you, make you
clean;” <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) put away iniquity
from your souls, and from before mine eyes, that the dry land may
appear. “Learn to do well; judge the fatherless; plead for the
widow,” <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) that the earth may
bring forth the green herb for meat, and the tree bearing fruit; <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) and come let us reason together,
saith the Lord, <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) that there
may be lights in the firmament of heaven, and that they may shine upon
the earth. <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md) That rich man
asked of the good Master what he should do to attain eternal life. <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) Let the good Master, whom he
thought a man, and nothing more, tell him (but He is “good” because He
is God)—let Him tell him, that if he would “enter into life” he must
“keep the commandments;” <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) let
him banish from himself the bitterness of malice and wickedness; <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) let him not kill, nor commit
adultery, nor steal, nor bear false witness; that the dry land may
appear, and bud forth the honouring of father and mother, and the love
of our neighbour. <span id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md) All these,
saith he, have I kept. <span id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md)
Whence, then, are there so many thorns, if the earth be fruitful? Go,
root up the woody thicket of avarice; sell that thou hast, and be filled
with fruit by giving to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
heaven; and follow the Lord “if thou wilt be perfect,” <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) coupled with those amongst whom He
speaketh wisdom, Who knoweth what to distribute to the day and to the
night, that thou also mayest know it, that for thee also there may be
lights in the firmament of heaven, which will not be unless thy heart be
there; <span id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) which likewise also
will not be unless thy treasure be there, as thou hast heard from the
good Master. But the barren earth was grieved, <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) and the thorns choked the
word. <span id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md)

<span id="vi.XIII.XIX-p17"></span>25. But you, “chosen generation, <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) you weak things of the world,” who
have forsaken all things that you might “follow the Lord,” go after Him,
and “confound the things which are mighty;” <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) go after Him, ye beautiful
feet, <span id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) and shine in the
firmament, <span id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md) that the heavens
may declare His glory, dividing between the light of the perfect, though
not as of the angels, and the darkness of the little, though not
despised ones. Shine over all the earth, and let the day, lightened by
the sun, utter unto day the word of wisdom; and let night, shining by
the moon, announce unto night the word of knowledge. <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) The moon and the stars shine for
the night, but the night obscureth them not, since they illumine it in
its degree. For behold God (as it were) saying, “Let there be lights in
the firmament of the heaven.” There came suddenly a sound from heaven,
as it had been the rushing of a mighty wind, and there appeared cloven
tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) And there were made lights in the
firmament of heaven, having the word of life. <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) Run ye to and fro everywhere, ye
holy fires, ye beautiful fires; for ye are the light of the world, <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) nor are ye put under a
bushel. <span id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) He to whom ye cleave
is exalted, and hath exalted you. Run ye to and fro, and be known unto
all nations.
