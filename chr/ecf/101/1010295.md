Times that “God Saw that It Was Good,” Yet Time Has No Relation to God
and His Word.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXIX-p2"></span>44. And I looked attentively to find
whether seven or eight times Thou sawest that Thy works were good, when
they were pleasing unto Thee; but in Thy seeing I found no times, by
which I might understand that thou sawest so often what Thou madest. And
I said, “O Lord,! is not this Thy Scripture true, since Thou art true,
and being Truth hast set it forth? Why, then, dost Thou say unto me that
in thy seeing there are no times, while this Thy Scripture telleth me
that what Thou madest each day, Thou sawest to be good; and when I
counted them I found how often?” Unto these things Thou repliest unto
me, for Thou art my God, and with strong voice tellest unto Thy servant
in his inner ear, bursting through my deafness, and crying, “O man, that
which My Scripture saith, I say; and yet doth that speak in time; but
time has no reference to My Word, because My Word existeth in equal
eternity with Myself. Thus those things which ye see through My Spirit,
I see, just as those things which ye speak through My Spirit, I speak.
And so when ye see those things in time, I see them not in time; as when
ye speak them in time, I speak them not in time.”
