<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXLVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 413.)

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p3.1"></span>A Letter of Instructions (Commonitorium)
to the Holy Brother Fortunatianus.</span>* <span
id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p5"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p5.1"></span>Chap. I.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p6"></span>1. I write this to remind you of the
request which I made when I was with you, that you would do me the
kindness of visiting our brother, whom we mentioned in conversation, in
order to ask him to forgive me, if he has construed as a harsh and
unfriendly attack upon himself any statement made by me in a recent
letter (which I do not regret having written), affirming that the eyes
of this body cannot see God, and never shall see Him. I added
immediately the reason why I made this statement, namely, to prevent men
from believing that God Himself is corporeal and visible, as occupying a
place determined by size and by distance from us (for the eye of this
body can see nothing except under these conditions), and to prevent men
from understanding the expression “face to face” <span
id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) as if God were limited within the
members of a body. Therefore I do not regret having made this statement,
as a protest against our forming such unworthy and profane ideas
concerning God as to think that He is not everywhere in His totality,
but susceptible of division, and distributed through localities in
space; for such are the only objects cognizable through these eyes of
ours.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p8"></span>2. But if, while holding no such
opinion as this concerning God, but believing Him to be a Spirit,
unchangeable, incorporeal, present in His whole Being everywhere, any
one thinks that the change on this body of ours (when from being a
natural body it shall become a spiritual body) will be so great that in
such a body it will be possible for us to see a spiritual substance not
susceptible of division according to local distance or dimension, or
even confined within the limits of bodily members, but everywhere
present in its totality, I wish him to instruct me in this matter, if
what he has discovered is true; but if in this opinion he is mistaken,
it is far less objectionable to ascribe to the body something that does
not belong to it, than to take away from God that which belongs to Him.
And even if that opinion be correct, it will not contradict my words in
that letter; for I said that the eyes of this body shall not see God,
meaning that the eyes of this body of ours can see nothing but bodies
which are separated from them by some interval of space, for if there be
no interval, even bodies themselves cannot through the eyes be seen by
us.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p9"></span>3. Moreover, if our bodies shall be
changed into something so different from what they now are as to have
eyes by means of which a substance shall be seen which is not diffused
through space or confined within limits, having one part in one place,
another in another, a smaller in a less space, a greater in a larger,
but in its totality spiritually present everywhere,—these bodies shall
be something very different from what they are at present, and shall no
longer be themselves, and shall be not only freed from mortality, and
corruption, and weight, but somehow or other shall be changed into the
quality of the mind itself, if they shall be able to see in a manner
which shall be then granted to the mind, but which is meanwhile not
granted even to the mind itself. For if, when a man’s habits are
changed, we say he is not the man he was,—if, when our age is changed,
we say that the body is not what it was, how much more may we say that
the body shall not be the same when it shall have undergone so great a
change as not only to have immortal life, but also to have power to see
Him who is invisible? Wherefore, if they shall thus see God, it is not
with the eyes of this body that He shall be seen, because in this also
it shall not be the same body, since it has been <span id="page_499">p.
499</span> <span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-Page_499"></span>changed to so great
an extent in capacity and power; and this opinion is, therefore, not
contrary to the words of my letter. If, however, the body shall be
changed only to this extent, that whereas now it is mortal, then it
shall be immortal, and whereas now it weighs down the soul, then, devoid
of weight, it shall be most ready for every motion, but unchanged in the
faculty of seeing objects which are discerned by their dimensions and
distances, it will still be utterly impossible for it to see a substance
that is incorporeal and is in its totality present everywhere. Whether,
therefore, the former or the latter supposition be correct, in both
cases it remains true that the eyes of this body shall not see God; or
if they are to see Him, they shall not be the eyes of *this* body, since
after so great a change they shall be the eyes of a body very different
from this.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p10"></span>4. But if this brother is able to
propound anything better on this subject, I am ready to learn either
from himself or from his instructor. If I were saying this ironically, I
would also say that I am prepared to learn concerning God that He has a
body having members, and is divisible in different localities in space;
which I do not say, because I am not speaking ironically, and I am
perfectly certain that God is not in any respect of such a nature; and I
wrote that letter to prevent men from believing Him to be such. In that
letter, being carried away by my zeal to warn against error, and writing
more freely because I did not name the person whose views I assailed, I
was too vehement and not sufficiently guarded, and did not consider as I
ought to have done the respect which was due by one brother and bishop
to the office of another: this I do not defend, but blame; this I
condemn rather than excuse, and beg that it may be forgiven. I entreat
him to remember our old friendship, and forget my recent offence. Let
him do that which he is displeased with me for not having done; let him
exhibit in granting pardon the gentleness which I have failed to show in
writing that letter. I thus ask, through your kindly mediation, what I
had resolved to ask of him in person if I had had an opportunity. I
indeed made an effort to obtain an interview with him (a venerable man,
worthy of being honoured by us all, writing to request it in my name),
but he declined to come, suspecting, I suppose, that, as very often
happens among men, some plot was prepared against him. Of my absolute
innocence of such guile, I beg you to do your utmost to assure him,
which by seeing him personally you can more easily do. State to him with
what deep and genuine grief I conversed with you about my having hurt
his feelings. Let him know how far I am from slighting him, how much in
him I fear God, and am mindful of our Head in whose body we are
brethren. My reason for thinking it better not to go to the place in
which he resides was, that we might not make ourselves a laughing-stock
to those without the pale of the Church, thereby bringing grief to our
friends and shame to ourselves. All this may be satisfactorily arranged
through the good offices of your Holiness and Charity; nay, rather, the
satisfactory issue is in the hands of Him who, by the faith which is His
gift, dwells in your heart, whom I am confident that our brother does
not refuse to honour in you, since he knows Christ experimentally as
dwelling in himself.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p11"></span>5. I, at all events, do not know
what I could do better in this case than ask pardon from the brother who
has complained that he was wounded by the harshness of my letter. He
will, I hope, do what he knows to be enjoined on him by Him who,
speaking through the apostle, says: “Forgiving one another, if any man
have a quarrel against any: even as God in Christ has forgiven
you;” <span id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615.md) “Be ye therefore
followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also
hath loved us.” <span id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616.md) Walking in
this love, let us inquire with oneness of heart, and, if possible, with
yet greater diligence than hitherto, into the nature of the spiritual
body which we shall have after our resurrection. “And if in anything we
be diversely minded, God shall reveal even this unto us,” <span
id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617.md) if we abide in Him. Now he who
dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, for “God is love,” <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618.md) —whether as the fountain of love in
its ineffable essence, or as the fountain whence He freely gives it to
us by His Spirit. If, then, it can be shown that love can at any time
become visible to our bodily eyes, then we grant that possibly God shall
be so too; but if love never can become visible, much less can He who is
Himself its Fountain or whatever other figurative name more excellent or
more appropriate can be employed in speaking of One so great.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p16"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p16.1"></span>Chap. II.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p17"></span>6. Some men of great gifts, and very
learned in the Holy Scriptures, who have, when an opportunity presented
itself, done much by their writings to benefit the Church and promote
the instruction of believers, have said that the invisible God is seen
in an invisible manner, that is, by that nature which in us also is
invisible, namely, a pure mind or heart. The holy Ambrose, when speaking
of Christ as the Word, says: “Jesus is seen not by the bodily, but by
the spiritual eyes;” and shortly after he adds: “The Jews saw Him not,
for their foolish heart was blinded,” <span
id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619.md) showing in this way how Christ is
seen. Also, when he was speaking of the <span id="page_500">p.
500</span> <span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-Page_500"></span>Holy Spirit, he
introduced the words of the Lord, saying: “I will pray the Father, and
He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for
ever, even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because
it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him;” <span
id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) and adds: “With good reason,
therefore, did He show Himself in the body, since in the substance of
His Godhead He is not seen. We have seen the Spirit, but in a bodily
form: let us see the Father also; but since we cannot see Him, let us
hear Him.” A little after he says: “Let us hear the Father, then, for
the Father is invisible; but the Son also is invisible as regards His
Godhead, for ‘no man hath seen God at any time;’ <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md) and since the Son is God, He is
certainly not seen in that in which He is God.” <span
id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p22"></span>7. The holy Jerome also says: “The
eye of man cannot see God as He is in His own nature; and this is true
not of man only; neither angels, nor thrones, nor powers, nor
principalities, nor any name which is named can see God, for no creature
can see its Creator.” By these words this very learned man sufficiently
shows what his opinion was on this subject in regard not only to the
present life, but also to that which is to come. For however much the
eyes of our body may be changed for the better, they shall only be made
equal to the eyes of the angels. Here, however, Jerome has affirmed that
the nature of the Creator is invisible even to the angels, and to every
creature without exception in heaven. If, however, a question arise on
this point, and a doubt is expressed whether we shall not be superior to
the angels, the mind of the Lord Himself is plain from the words which
He uses in speaking of those who shall rise again to the kingdom: “They
shall be equal unto the angels.” <span
id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) Whence the same holy Jerome thus
expresses himself in another passage: “Man, therefore, cannot see the
face of God but the angels of the least in the Church do always behold
the face of God. <span id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624.md) And now we
see as in a mirror darkly, in a riddle, but then face to face; <span
id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625.md) when from being men we shall
advance to the rank of angels, and shall be able to say with the
apostle, ‘We all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory
of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even
as by the Spirit of the Lord;’ <span
id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626.md) although no creature can see the
face of God, according to the essential properties of His nature, and He
is, in these cases, seen by the mind, since He is believed to be
invisible.” <span id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p28"></span>8. In these words of this man of God
there are many things deserving our consideration: first, that in
accordance with the very clear declaration of the Lord, he also is of
opinion that we shall then see the face of God when we shall have
advanced to the rank of angels, that is, shall be made equal to the
angels, which doubtless shall be at the resurrection of the dead. Next,
he has sufficiently explained by the testimony of the apostle, that the
face is to be understood not of the outward but of the inward man, when
it is said we shall “see face to face;” for the apostle was speaking of
the face of the heart when he used the words quoted in this connection
by Jerome: “We, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory
of the Lord, are changed into the same image.” <span
id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628.md) If any one doubt this, let him
examine the passage again, and notice of what the apostle was speaking,
namely, of the veil, which remains on the heart of every one in reading
the Old Testament, until he pass over to Christ, that the veil may be
removed. For he there says: “We also, with unveiled face, beholding as
in a mirror the glory of the Lord,”—which face had not been unveiled in
the Jews, of whom he says, “the veil is upon their heart,”—in order to
show that the face unveiled in us when the veil is taken away is the
face of the heart. In fine, lest any one, looking on these things with
too little care and therefore failing to discern their meaning, should
believe that God now is or shall hereafter be visible either to angels
or to men, when they shall have been made equal to the angels, he has
most plainly expressed his opinion by affirming that “no creature can
see the face of God according to the essential properties of His
nature,” and that “He is, in these cases, seen by the mind, since He is
believed to be invisible.” From these statements he sufficiently showed
that when God has been seen by men through the eyes of the body as if He
had a body, He has not been seen as to the essential properties of his
nature, in which He is seen by the mind, since He is believed to be
invisible—invisible, that is to say, to the bodily perception even of
celestial beings, as Jerome had said above, of angels, and powers, and
principalities. How much more, then, is He invisible to terrestrial
beings!

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p30"></span>9. Wherefore, in another place,
Jerome says in still plainer terms, it is true not only of the divinity
of the Father but equally of that of the Son and of that of the Holy
Spirit, forming one nature in the Trinity, that it cannot be seen by the
eyes of the flesh, but by the eyes of the mind, of which the Saviour
Himself says: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.” <span id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629.md) <span id="page_501">p.
501</span> <span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-Page_501"></span>What could be more
clear than this statement? For if he had merely said that it is
impossible for the divinity of the Father, or of the Son, or of the Holy
Spirit, to be seen by the eyes of the flesh, and had not added the
words, “but only by the eyes of the mind,” it might perhaps have been
said, that when the body shall have become spiritual it can no longer be
called “flesh;” but by adding the words, “but only by the eyes of the
mind,” he has excluded the vision of God from every sort of body. Lest,
however, any one should suppose that he was speaking only of the present
state of being, observe that he has subjoined also a testimony of the
Lord, quoted with the design of defining the eyes of the mind of which
he had spoken; in which testimony a promise is given not of present, but
of future vision: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they *shall* see
God.”

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p32"></span>10. The very blessed Athanasius,
also, Bishop of Alexandria, when contending against the Arians, who
affirm that the Father alone is invisible, but suppose the Son and the
Holy Spirit to be visible, asserted the equal invisibility of all the
Persons of the Trinity, proving it by testimonies from Holy Scripture,
and arguing with all his wonted care in controversy, labouring earnestly
to convince his opponents that God has never been seen, except through
His assuming the form of a creature; and that in His essential Deity God
is invisible, that is, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are
invisible, except in so far as the Divine Persons can be known by the
mind and the spirit. Gregory, also, a holy Eastern bishop, very plainly
says that God, by nature invisible, had, on those occasions on which He
was seen by the fathers (as by Moses, with whom He talked face to face),
made it possible for Himself to be seen by assuming the form of
something material and discernible. <span
id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630.md) Our Ambrose says the same: “That
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, when visible, are seen
under forms assumed by choice, not prescribed by the nature of
Deity;” <span id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631.md) thus clearing the
truth of the saying, “No man hath seen God at any time,” <span
id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632.md) which is the word of the Lord
Christ Himself, and of that other saying, “Whom no man hath seen, nor
can see,” <span id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633.md) which is the word
of the apostle, yea, rather, of Christ by His apostle; as well as
vindicating the consistency of those passages of Scripture in which God
is related to have been seen, because He is both invisible in the
essential nature of His Deity, and able to become visible when He
pleases, by assuming such created form as shall seem good to Him.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p37"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p37.1"></span>Chap. III.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p38"></span>11. Moreover, if invisibility is a
property of the divine nature, as incorruptibility is, that nature shall
assuredly not undergo such a change in the future world as to cease to
be invisible and become visible; because it shall never be possible for
it to cease to be incorruptible and become corruptible, for it is in
both attributes alike immutable. The apostle assuredly declared the
excellence of the divine nature when he placed these two together,
saying, “Now, unto the King of ages, invisible, incorruptible, the only
God, be honour and glory for ever and ever.” <span
id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634.md) Wherefore I dare not make such a
distinction as to say incorruptible, indeed, for ever and ever, but
invisible—not for ever and ever, but only in this world. At the same
time, since the testimonies which we are next to quote cannot be
false,—”Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,” <span
id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635.md) and, “We know that, when He shall
appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is,” <span
id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) —we cannot deny that the sons of
God shall see God; but they shall see Him as invisible things are seen,
in the manner in which He who appeared in the flesh, visible to men,
promised that He would manifest Himself to men, when, speaking in the
presence of the disciples and seen by their eyes, He said: “I will love
him, and *will* manifest myself to him.” In what other manner are
invisible things seen than by the eyes of the mind, concerning which, as
the instruments of our vision of God, I have shortly before quoted the
opinion of Jerome?

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p42"></span>12. Hence, also, the statement of
the Bishop of Milan, whom I have quoted before, who says that even in
the resurrection it is not easy for any but those who have a pure heart
to see God, and therefore it is written, “Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.” “How many,” he says, “had He already enumerated
as blessed, and yet to them He had not promised the power of seeing
God;” and he adds this inference, “If, therefore, the pure in heart
shall see God, it is obvious that others shall not see Him;” and to
prevent our understanding him to refer to those others of whom the Lord
had said, “Blessed are the poor, blessed are the meek,” he immediately
subjoined, “For those that are unworthy shall not see God,” intending it
to be understood that the unworthy are those who, although they shall
rise again, shall not be able to see God, since they shall rise to
condemnation, because they refused to purify their hearts through that
true faith which “worketh by love.” <span
id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637.md) For this reason he goes on to say,
<span id="page_502">p. 502</span> <span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-Page_502"></span>“Whosoever has been unwilling to see
God cannot see Him.” Then, since it occurred to him that, in a sense,
even all wicked men have a desire to see God, he immediately explains
that he used the words, “Whosoever has been unwilling to see God,”
because the fact that the wicked do not desire to purify the heart, by
which alone God can be seen, shows that they do not desire to see God,
and follows up this statement with the words: “God is not seen in space,
but in the pure heart; nor is He sought out by the eyes of the body; nor
is He defined in form by our faculty of sight; nor grasped by the touch;
His voice does not fall on the ear; nor are His goings perceived by the
senses.” <span id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638.md) By these words the
blessed Ambrose desired to teach the preparation which men ought to make
if they wish to see God, viz. to purify the heart by the faith which
worketh by love, through the gift of the Holy Spirit, from whom we have
received the earnest by which we are taught to desire that vision. <span
id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p46"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p46.1"></span>Chap. IV.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p47"></span>13. For as to the members of God
which the Scripture frequently mentions, lest any one should suppose
that we resemble God as to the form and figure of the body, the same
Scripture speaks of God as having also wings, which we certainly have
not. As then, when we hear of the “wings” of God, we understand the
divine protection, so by the “hands” of God we ought to understand His
working,—by His “feet,” His presence,—by His “eyes,” His power of seeing
and knowing all things,—by His face, that whereby He reveals Himself to
our knowledge; and I believe that any other such expression used in
Scripture is to be spiritually understood. In this opinion I am not
singular, nor am I the first who has stated it. It is the opinion of all
who by any spiritual interpretation of such language in Scripture resist
those who are called Anthropomorphites. Not to occupy too much time by
quoting largely from the writings of these men, I introduce here one
extract from the pious Jerome, in order that our brother may know that,
if anything moves him to maintain an opposite opinion, he is bound to
carry on the debate with those who preceded me not less than with
myself.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p48"></span>14. In the exposition which that
most learned student of Scripture has given of the psalm in which occur
the words, “Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
will ye be wise? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? or He that
formed the eye, doth He not behold?” <span
id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640.md) he says, among other things: “This
passage furnishes a strong argument against those who are
Anthropomorphites, and say that God has members such as we have. For
example, God is said by them to have eyes, because ‘the eyes of the Lord
behold all things:’ in the same, literal manner they take the statements
that the hand of the Lord doeth all things, and that Adam ‘heard the
sound of the feet of the Lord walking in the garden,’ and thus they
ascribe the infirmities of men to the majesty of God. But I affirm that
God is all eye, all hand, all foot: all eye, because He sees all things;
all hand, because He worketh all things; all foot, because He is
everywhere present. See, therefore, what the Psalmist saith: ‘He that
planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, doth He not
behold?’ He doth not say: ‘He that planted the ear, has He not an ear?
and He that formed the eye, has He not an eye?’ But what does he say?
‘He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye,
doth He not behold?’ The Psalmist has ascribed to God the powers of
seeing and hearing, but has not assigned members to Him.” <span
id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p51"></span>15. I have thought it my duty to
quote all these passages from the writings of both Latin and Greek
authors who, being in the Catholic Church before our time, have written
commentaries on the divine oracles, in order that our brother, if he
hold any different opinion from theirs, may know that it becomes him,
laying aside all bitterness of controversy, and preserving or reviving
fully the gentleness of brotherly love, to investigate with diligent and
calm consideration either what he must learn from others, or what others
must learn from him. For the reasonings of any men whatsoever, even
though they be Catholics, and of high reputation, are not to be treated
by us in the same way as the canonical Scriptures are treated. We are at
liberty, without doing any violence to the respect which these men
deserve, to condemn and reject anything in their writings, if perchance
we shall find that they have entertained opinions differing from that
which others or we ourselves have, by the divine help, discovered to be
the truth. I deal thus with the writings of others, and I wish my
intelligent readers to deal thus with mine. In fine, I do by the help of
the Lord most stedfastly believe, and, in so far as He enables me, I
understand what is taught in all the statements which I have now quoted
from the works of the holy and learned Ambrose, Jerome, Athanasius,
Gregory, and in any other similar statements in other writers which I
have read, but have for the sake of brevity forborne from quoting,
namely, that God is not a body, that He has not the members of the human
frame, that He is not divisible through space, and that He is
unchangeably invisible, and appeared not in His essential nature and
substance, <span id="page_503">p. 503</span> <span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-Page_503"></span>but in such visible form as He
pleased to those to whom he appeared on the occasions on which Scripture
records that He was seen by holy persons with the eyes of the body.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p52"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p52.1"></span>Chap. V.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p53"></span>16. As to the spiritual body which
we shall have in the resurrection, how great a change for the better it
is to undergo,—whether it shall become pure spirit, so that the whole
man shall then be a spirit, or shall (as I rather think, but do not yet
confidently maintain) become a spiritual body in such a way as to be
called spiritual because of a certain ineffable facility in its
movements, but at the same time to retain its material substance, which
cannot live and feel by itself, but only through the spirit which uses
it (for in our present state, in like manner, although the body is
spoken of as animated \[animal\], the nature of the animating principle
is different from that of the body), and whether, if the properties of
the body then immortal and incorruptible shall remain unchanged, it
shall then in some degree aid the spirit to see visible, i,e. material
things, as at present we are unable to see anything of that kind except
through the eyes of the body, or our spirit shall then be able, even in
its higher state, to know material things without the instrumentality of
the body (for God Himself does not know these things through bodily
senses), on these and on many other things which may perplex us in the
discussion of this subject, I confess that I have not yet read anywhere
anything which I would esteem sufficiently established to deserve to be
either learned or taught by men.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p54"></span>17. And for this reason, if our
brother will bear patiently any degree whatever of hesitation on my
part, let us in the meantime, because of that which is written, “We
shall see Him as He is,” prepare, so far as with the help of God Himself
we are enabled, hearts purified for that vision. Let us at the same time
inquire more calmly and carefully concerning the spiritual body, for it
may be that God, if He know this to be useful to us, may condescend to
show us some definite and clear view on the subject, in accordance with
His written word. For if a more careful investigation shall result in
the discovery that the change on the body shall be so great that it
shall be able to see things that are invisible, such power imparted to
the body will not, I think, deprive the mind of the power of seeing, and
thus give the outward man a vision of God which is denied to the inward
man; as if, in contradiction of the plain words of Scripture, “that God
may be all and in all,” <span id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642.md) God
were only beside the man—without him, and not in the man, in his inner
being; or as if He, who is everywhere present in his entirety, unlimited
in space, is so within man that He can be seen outside only by the
outward man, but cannot be seen inside by the inward man. If such
opinions are palpably absurd,—for, on the contrary, the saints shall be
full of God; they shall not, remaining empty within, be surrounded
outside by Him; nor shall they, through being blind within, fail to see
Him of whom they are full, and, having eyes only for that which is
outside of themselves, behold Him by whom they shall be surrounded,—if,
I say, these things are absurd, it remains for us to rest meanwhile
certainly assured as to the vision of God by the inward man. But if, by
some wondrous change, the body shall be endowed with this power, another
new faculty shall be added; the faculty formerly possessed shall not be
taken away.

<span id="vii.1.CXLVIII-p56"></span>18. It is better, then, that we
affirm that concerning which we have no doubt,—that God shall be seen by
the inward man, which alone is able, in our present state, to see that
love in commendation of which the apostle says, “God is love;” <span
id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643.md) the inward man, which alone is able
to see “peace and holiness, without which no man shall see the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644.md) For no fleshly eye now
sees love, peace, and holiness, and such things; yet all of them are
seen, so far as they can be seen, by the eye of the mind, and the purer
it is the more clearly it sees; so that we may, without hesitation,
believe that we shall see God, whether we succeed or fail in our
investigations as to the nature of our future body—although, at the same
time, we hold it to be certain that the body shall rise again, immortal
and incorruptible, because on this we have the plainest and strongest
testimony of Holy Scripture. If, however, our brother affirm now that he
has arrived at certain knowledge as to that spiritual body, in regard to
which I am only inquiring, he will have just cause to be displeased with
me if I shall refuse to listen calmly to his instructions, provided only
that he also listen calmly to my questions. Now, however, I entreat you,
for Christ’s sake, to obtain his forgiveness for me for that harshness
in my letter, by which, as I have learned, he was, not without cause,
offended; and may you, by God’s help, cheer my spirit by your answer.

one of the seven bishop selected to represent the Catholics in the
Conference of Carthage with the Donatists in 411. He was probably a
neighbour of the bishop who had regarded himself as aggrieved by the
arguments with which Augustin confuted some extravagant speculations of
his.
