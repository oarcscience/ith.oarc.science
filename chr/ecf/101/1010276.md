id="vi.XIII.X-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—That Nothing Arose Save by the
Gift of God.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.X-p2"></span>11. Happy creature, which, though in
itself it was other than Thou, hath known no other state than that as
soon as it was made, it was, without any interval of time, by Thy Gift,
which is borne over everything mutable, raised up by that calling
whereby Thou saidst, “Let there be light, and there was light.” Whereas
in us there is a difference of times, in that we were darkness, and are
made light; <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) but of that it is
only said what it would have been had it not been enlightened. And this
is so spoken as if it had been fleeting and darksome before; that so the
cause whereby it was made to be otherwise might appear,—that is to say,
being turned to the unfailing Light it might become light. Let him who
is able understand this; and let him who is not, <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) ask of Thee. Why should he trouble
me, as if I could enlighten any “man that cometh into the world?” <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md)
