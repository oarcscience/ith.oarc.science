id="vi.X.XXIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—He Who Finds Truth, Finds
God.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXIV-p2"></span>35. Behold how I have enlarged in my
memory seeking Thee, O Lord; and out of it have I not found Thee. Nor
have I found aught concerning Thee, but what I have retained in memory
from the time I learned Thee. For from the time I learned Thee have I
never forgotten Thee. For where I found truth, there found I my God, who
is the Truth itself, <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869) which from
the time I learned it have I not forgotten. And thus since the time I
learned Thee, Thou abidest in my memory; and there do I find Thee
whensoever I call Thee to remembrance, and delight in Thee. These are my
holy delights, which Thou hast bestowed upon me in Thy mercy, having
respect unto my poverty.
