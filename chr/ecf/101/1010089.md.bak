id="vi.V.XIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—He is Sent to Milan, that He,
About to Teach Rhetoric, May Be Known by Ambrose.</span>

<span id="vi.V.XIII-p2"></span>23. When, therefore, they of Milan had
sent <span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span
id="vi.V.XIII-Page_88"></span>to Rome to the prefect of the city, to
provide them with a teacher of rhetoric for their city, and to despatch
him at the public expense, I made interest through those identical
persons, drunk with Manichæan vanities, to be freed from whom I was
going away,—neither of us, however, being aware of it,—that Symmachus,
the then prefect, having proved me by proposing a subject, would send
me. And to Milan I came, unto Ambrose the bishop, known to the whole
world as among the best of men, Thy devout servant; whose eloquent
discourse did at that time strenuously dispense unto Thy people the
flour of Thy wheat, the “gladness” of Thy “oil,” and the sober
intoxication of Thy “wine.” <span id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) To
him was I unknowingly led by Thee, that by him I might knowingly be led
to Thee. That man of God received me like a father, and looked with a
benevolent and episcopal kindliness on my change of abode. And I began
to love him, not at first, indeed, as a teacher of the truth,—which I
entirely despaired of in Thy Church,—but as a man friendly to myself.
And I studiously hearkened to him preaching to the people, not with the
motive I should, but, as it were, trying to discover whether his
eloquence came up to the fame thereof, or flowed fuller or lower than
was asserted; and I hung on his words intently, but of the matter I was
but as a careless and contemptuous spectator; and I was delighted with
the pleasantness of his speech, more erudite, yet less cheerful and
soothing in manner, than that of Faustus. Of the matter, however, there
could be no comparison; for the latter was straying amid Manichæan
deceptions, whilst the former was teaching salvation most soundly. But
“salvation is far from the wicked,” <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) such as I then stood before him; and
yet I was drawing nearer gradually and unconsciously.
