multiplied, and my mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to
my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and
bleeding. And she went back to Africa, making a vow unto Thee never to
know another man, leaving with me my natural son by her. But I, unhappy
one, who could not imitate a woman, impatient of delay, since it was not
until two years’ time I was to obtain her I sought,—being not so much a
lover of marriage as a slave to lust,—procured another (not a wife,
though), that so by the bondage of a lasting habit the disease of my

“Likewise in the body, better is a wound with pain than putrefaction
without pain, which is specially styled corruption;” and the same idea
is embodied in the extract from Caird’s *Sermons*, on p. 5, note 7.
