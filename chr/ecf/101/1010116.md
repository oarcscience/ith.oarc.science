Degrees Arrives at the Truth.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.VIII-p2"></span>12. “But Thou, O Lord, shall endure for
ever,” <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495) yet not for ever art Thou
angry with us, because Thou dost commiserate our dust and ashes; and it
was pleasing in Thy sight to reform my deformity, and by inward stings
didst Thou disturb me, that I should be dissatisfied until Thou wert
made sure to my inward sight. And by the secret hand of Thy remedy was
my swelling lessened, and the disordered and darkened eyesight of my
mind, by the sharp anointings of healthful sorrows, was from day to day
made whole.
