id="vii.1.CXXXI-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXI.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXXXI-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXXXI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 412.)

<span id="vii.1.CXXXI-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXXXI-p3.1"></span>To His Most Excellent Daughter, the Noble
and Deservedly Illustrious Lady Proba, Augustin Sends Greeting in the
Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXXXI-p4"></span>You speak the truth when you say that
the soul, having its abode in a corruptible body, is restrained by this
measure of contact with the earth, and is somehow so bent and crushed by
this burden that its desires and thoughts go more easily downwards to
many things than upwards to one. For Holy Scripture says the same: “The
corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle
weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.” <span
id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md) But our Saviour, who by His healing
word raised up the woman in the gospel that had been eighteen years
bowed down <span id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495.md) (whose case was,
perchance, a figure of spiritual infirmity), came for this purpose, that
Christians might not hear in vain the call, “Lift up your hearts,” and
might truly reply, “We lift them up to the Lord.” Looking to this, you
do well to regard the evils of this world as easy to bear because of the
hope of the world to come. For thus, by being rightly used, these evils
become a blessing, because, while they do not increase our desires for
this world, they exercise our patience; as to which the apostle says,
“We know that all things work together for good to them that love
God:” <span id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) *all* things, he
saith—not only, therefore, those which are desired because pleasant, but
also those which are shunned because painful; since we receive the
former without being carried away by them, and bear the latter without
being crushed by them, and in all give thanks, according to the divine
command, to Him of whom we say, “I will bless the Lord at all times; His
praise shall continually be in my mouth,” <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md) and, “It is good for me that Thou
hast humbled me, that I might learn Thy statutes.” <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) The truth is, most noble lady, that
if the calm of this treacherous prosperity were always smiling upon us,
the soul of man would never make for the haven of true and certain
safety. Wherefore, in returning the respectful salutation due to your
Excellency, and expressing my gratitude for your most pious care for my
welfare, I ask of the Lord that He may grant to you the rewards of the
life to come, and consolation in the present life; and I commend myself
to the love and prayers of all of you in whose hearts Christ dwells by
faith.

<span id="vii.1.CXXXI-p10"></span>(*In another hand*.) May the true and
faithful God truly comfort your heart and preserve <span
id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span id="vii.1.CXXXI-Page_470"></span>your
health, my most excellent daughter and noble lady, deservedly
illustrious.
