<span id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXIV.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 405.)

<span id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p3.1"></span>To My Lord Novatus, Most Blessed, My
Brother and Partner in the Priestly Office, Esteemed and Longed For, and
to the Brethren Who are with Him, Augustin and the Brethren with Him
Send Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p4"></span>1. I myself feel how hard-hearted I
must appear to you, and I can scarcely excuse to myself my conduct in
not consenting to send to your Holiness my son the deacon Lucillus, your
own brother. But when your own time comes to surrender to the claims of
Churches in remote places some of those whom you have educated, and who
are most dear and sweet to you, then, and not till then, will you know
the pangs of longing which pierce me through and through for some who,
once united to me in the strongest and most pleasing intimacy, are no
more beside me. Let me submit to your thoughts the case of one who is
far away. However strong be the bond of kindred between brothers, it
does not surpass the bond by which my brother Severus and I are united
to each other, and yet you know how rarely I have the happiness of
seeing him. And this has been caused neither by his wish nor by mine,
but because of our giving to the claims of our mother the Church
precedency above the claims of this present world, out of regard to that
coming eternity in which we shall dwell together and part no more. How
much more reasonable, therefore, is it for you to submit for the sake of
the Church’s welfare to the absence of that brother, with whom you have
not shared the food which the Lord our Shepherd provides for nearly so
long a period as I <span id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span
id="vii.1.LXXXIV-Page_364"></span>did with my most amiable
fellow-townsman Severus, who now only with an effort and at long
intervals converses with me by means of brief letters,—letters,
moreover, which are for the most part burdened with the cares and
affairs of other men, instead of bearing to me any reminiscence of those
green pastures in which we were wont to lie down under Christ’s loving
care!

<span id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p5"></span>5. You will perhaps reply, “What then?
May not my brother be of service to the Church here also? Is it for any
other end than usefulness to the Church that I desire to have him with
me?” Truly, if his being beside you seemed to me to be as important for
the gathering in or ruling of the Lord’s flock as his presence here is
for these ends, every one might justly blame me for being not merely
hard-hearted, but unjust. But since he is conversant with the
Punic <span id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md) language, through want
of which the preaching of the gospel is greatly hindered in these parts,
whereas the use of that language is general with you, do you think that
we would be doing our duty in consulting for the welfare of the Lord’s
flocks, if we were to send this talent to a place where it is not
specially needful, and remove it from this region, where we thirst for
it with such parched spirits? Forgive me, therefore, when I do, not only
against your will, but also against my own feeling, what the care of the
burden imposed upon me compels me to do. The Lord, to whom you have
given your heart, will grant you such aid in your labours that you shall
be recompensed for this kindness; for we acknowledge that you have with
a good grace rather than of necessity conceded the deacon Lucillus to
the burning thirst of the regions in which our lot is cast. For you will
do me no small favour if you do not burden me with any further request
upon this subject, lest I should have occasion to appear anything more
than somewhat hard-hearted to you, whom I revere for your holy benignity
of disposition.

<span id="vii.1.LXXXIV-p6"></span> The text here gives *latinâ*. All
that we know of the languages then spoken in Hippo would lead us to
suppose that *punicâ* must have been written here by Augustin.
