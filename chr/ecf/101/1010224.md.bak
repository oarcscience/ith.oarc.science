<span id="vi.XI.XXIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XI.XXIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—That Time is a Certain
Extension.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XXIII-p2"></span>29. I have heard from a learned man
that the motions of the sun, moon, and stars constituted time, and I
assented not. <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) For why should
not rather the motions of all bodies be time? What if the lights of
heaven should cease, and a potter’s wheel run round, would there be no
time by which we might measure those revolutions, and say either that it
turned with equal pauses, or, if it were moved at one time more slowly,
at another more quickly, that some revolutions were longer, others less
so? Or while we were saying this, should we not also be speaking in
time? Or should there in our words be some syllables long, others short,
but because those sounded in a longer time, these in a shorter? God
grant to men to see in a small thing ideas common to things great and
small. Both the stars and luminaries of heaven are “for signs and for
seasons, and for days and years.” <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) No doubt they are; but neither
should I say that the circuit of that wooden wheel was a day, nor yet
should he say that therefore there was no time.

<span id="vi.XI.XXIII-p5"></span>30. I desire to know the power and
nature of time, by which we measure the motions of bodies, and say (for
example) that this motion is twice as long as that. For, I ask, since
“day” declares not the stay only of the sun upon the earth, according to
which day is one thing, night another, but also its entire circuit from
east even to east,—according to which we say, “So many days have passed”
(the nights being included when we say “so many days,” and their spaces
not counted apart),—since, then, the day is finished by the motion of
the sun, and by his circuit from east to east, I ask, whether the motion
itself is the day, or the period in which that motion is completed, or
both? For if the first be the day, then would there be a day although
the sun should finish that course in so small a space of time as an
hour. If the second, then that would not be a day if from one sunrise to
another there were but so short a period as an hour, but the sun must go
round four-and-twenty times to complete a day. If both, neither could
that be called a day if the sun should run his entire round in the space
of an hour; nor that, if, while the sun stood still, so much time should
pass as the sun is accustomed to accomplish his whole course in from
morning to morning. I shall not therefore now ask, what that is which is
called day, but what time is, by which we, measuring the circuit of the
sun, should say that it was accomplished in half the space of time it
was wont, if it had been completed in so small a space as twelve hours;
and comparing both times, we should call that single, this double time,
although the sun should run his course from east to east sometimes in
that single, sometimes in that double time. Let no man then tell me that
the motions of the heavenly bodies are times, because, when at the
prayer of one the sun stood still in order that he might achieve his
victorious battle, the sun stood still, but time went on. For in such
space of time as was sufficient was that battle fought and ended. <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) I see that time, then, is a certain
extension. But do I see it, or do I seem to see it? Thou, O Light and
Truth, wilt show me.

<span id="vi.XI.XXIII-p3"></span> Compare Gillies (*Analysis of
Aristotle*, c. 2, p. 138): “As our conception of space originates in
that of body, and our conception of motion in that of space, so our
conception of time originates in that of motion; and particularly in
those regular and equable motions carried on in the heavens, the parts
of which, from their perfect similarity to each other, are correct
measures of the continuous and successive quantity called Time, with
which they are conceived to co-exist. Time, therefore, may be defined
the perceived number of successive movements; for, as number ascertains
the greater or lesser quantity of things numbered, so time ascertains
the greater or lesser quantity of motion performed.” And with this
accords Monboddo’s definition of time (*Ancient Metaphysics*, vol. i.
book 4, chap. i.), as “the measure of the duration of things that exist
in succession by the motion of the heavenly bodies.” See xii. sec. 40,
and note, below.
