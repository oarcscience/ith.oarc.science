<span id="vii.1.XXXVII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.XXXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXXVII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XXXVII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 397.)

<span id="vii.1.XXXVII-p3"></span>*<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXVII-p3.1"></span>To Simplicianus,</span>* <span
id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) *<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XXXVII-p4.2"></span>My Lord Most Blessed, and My Father Most
Worthy of Being Cherished with Respect and Sincere Affection, Augustin
Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>*

<span id="vii.1.XXXVII-p5"></span>1. I received the letter which your
Holiness kindly sent,—a letter full of occasions of much joy to me,
because assuring me that you remember me, that you love me as you used
to do, and that you take great pleasure in every one of the gifts which
the Lord has in His compassion <span id="page_271">p. 271</span> <span
id="vii.1.XXXVII-Page_271"></span>been pleased to bestow on me. In
reading that letter, I have eagerly welcomed the fatherly affection
which flows from your benignant heart towards me: and this I have not
found for the first time, as something short-lived and new, but long ago
proved and well known, my lord, most blessed, and most worthy of being
cherished with respect and sincere love.

<span id="vii.1.XXXVII-p6"></span>2. Whence comes so great a recompense
for the literary labour given by me to the writing of a few books as
this, that your Excellency should condescend to read them? Is it not
that the Lord, to whom my soul is devoted, has purposed thus to comfort
me under my anxieties, and to lighten the fear with which in such labour
I cannot but be exercised, lest, notwithstanding the evenness of the
plain of truth, I stumble through want either of knowledge or of
caution? For when what I write meets your approval, I know by whom it is
approved, for I know who dwells in you; and the Giver and Dispenser of
all spiritual gifts designs by your approbation to confirm my obedience
to Him. For whatever in these writings of mine merits your approbation
is from God, who has by me as His instrument said, “Let it be done,” and
it was done; and in your approval God has pronounced that what was done
is “good.” <span id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md)

<span id="vii.1.XXXVII-p8"></span>3. As for the questions which you have
condescended to command me to resolve, even if through the dulness of my
mind I did not understand them, I might through the assistance of your
merits find an answer to them. This only I ask, that on account of my
weakness you intercede with God for me, and that whatever writings of
mine come into your sacred hands, whether on the topics to which you
have in a manner so kind and fatherly directed my attention, or on any
others, you will not only take pains to read them, but also accept the
charge of reviewing and correcting them; for I acknowledge the mistakes
which I myself have made, as readily as the gifts which God has bestowed
on me.
