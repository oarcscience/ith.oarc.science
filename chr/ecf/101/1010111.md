<span id="vi.VII.III-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VII.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—That the Cause of Evil is the
Free Judgment of the Will.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.III-p2"></span>4. But I also, as yet, although I said
and was firmly persuaded, that Thou our Lord, the true God, who madest
not only our souls but our bodies, and not our souls and bodies alone,
but all creatures and all things, wert uncontaminable and inconvertible,
and in no part mutable: yet understood I not readily and clearly what
was the cause of evil. And yet, whatever it was, I perceived that it
must be so sought out as not to constrain me by it to believe that the
immutable God was mutable, lest I myself <span id="page_104">p.
104</span> <span id="vi.VII.III-Page_104"></span>should become the thing
that I was seeking out. I sought, therefore, for it free from care,
certain of the untruthfulness of what these asserted, whom I shunned
with my whole heart; for I perceived that through seeking after the
origin of evil, they were filled with malice, in that they liked better
to think that Thy Substance did suffer evil than that their own did
commit it. <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md)

<span id="vi.VII.III-p4"></span>5. And I directed my attention to
discern what I now heard, that free will <span
id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) was the cause of our doing evil, and
Thy righteous judgment of our suffering it. But I was unable clearly to
discern it. So, then, trying to draw the eye of my mind from that pit, I
was plunged again therein, and trying often, was as often plunged back
again. But this raised me towards Thy light, that I knew as well that I
had a will as that I had life: when, therefore, I was willing or
unwilling to do anything, I was most certain that it was none but myself
that was willing and unwilling; and immediately I perceived that there
was the cause of my sin. But what I did against my will I saw that I
suffered rather than did, and that judged I not to be my fault, but my
punishment; whereby, believing Thee to be most just, I quickly confessed
myself to be not unjustly punished. But again I said: “Who made me? Was
it not my God, who is not only good, but goodness itself? Whence came I
then to will to do evil, and to be unwilling to do good, that there
might be cause for my just punishment? Who was it that put this in me,
and implanted in me the root of bitterness, seeing I was altogether made
by my most sweet God? If the devil were the author, whence is that
devil? And if he also, by his own perverse will, of a good angel became
a devil, whence also was the evil will in him whereby he became a devil,
seeing that the angel was made altogether good by that most Good
Creator?” By these reflections was I again cast down and stifled; yet
not plunged into that hell of error (where no man confesseth unto
Thee), <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) to think that Thou dost
suffer evil, rather than that man doth it.
