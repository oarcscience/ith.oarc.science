<span id="vii.1.C-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.C-p1.1"></span>Letter C.</span>

<span id="vii.1.C-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.C-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 409.)

<span id="vii.1.C-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.C-p3.1"></span>To Donatus His Noble and Deservedly Honourable
Lord, and Eminently Praiseworthy Son, Augustin Sends Greeting in the
Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.C-p4"></span>1. I would indeed that the African Church
were not placed in such trying circumstances as to need the aid of any
earthly power. But since, as the apostle says, “there is no power but of
God,” <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) it is unquestionable
that, when by you the sincere sons of your Catholic Mother help is given
to her, our help is in the name of the Lord, “who made heaven and
earth.” <span id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md) For oh, noble and
deservedly honourable lord, and eminently praiseworthy son, who does not
perceive that in the midst of so great calamities no small consolation
has been bestowed upon us by God, in that you, such a man, and so
devoted to the name of Christ, have been raised to the dignity of
proconsul, so that power allied with your goodwill may restrain the
enemies of the Church from their wicked and sacrilegious attempts? In
fact, there is only one thing of which we are much afraid in your
administration of justice, viz., lest perchance, seeing that every
injury done by impious and ungrateful men against the Christian society
is a more serious and heinous crime than if it had been done against
others, you should on this ground consider that it ought to be punished
with a severity corresponding to the enormity of the crime, and not with
the moderation which is suitable to Christian forbearance. We beseech
you, in the name of Jesus Christ, not to act in this manner. For we do
not seek to revenge ourselves in this world; nor ought the things which
we suffer to reduce us to such distress of mind as to leave no room in
our memory for the precepts in regard to this which we have <span
id="page_412">p. 412</span> <span id="vii.1.C-Page_412"></span>received
from Him for whose truth and in whose name we suffer; we “love our
enemies,” and we “pray for them.” <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) It is not their death, but their
deliverance from error, that we seek to accomplish by the help of the
terror of judges and of laws, whereby they may be preserved from falling
under the penalty of eternal judgment; we do not wish either to see the
exercise of discipline towards them neglected, or, on the other hand, to
see them subjected to the severer punishments which they deserve. Do
you, therefore, check their sins in such a way, that the sinners may be
spared to repent of their sins.

<span id="vii.1.C-p8"></span>2. We beg you, therefore, when you are
pronouncing judgment in cases affecting the Church, how wicked soever
the injuries may be which you shall ascertain to have been attempted or
inflicted on the Church, to forget that you have the power of capital
punishment, and not to forget our request. Nor let it appear to you an
unimportant matter and beneath your notice, my most beloved and honoured
son, that we ask you to spare the lives of the men on whose behalf we
ask God to grant them repentance. For even granting that we ought never
to deviate from a fixed purpose of overcoming evil with good, let your
own wisdom take this also into consideration, that no person beyond
those who belong to the Church is at pains to bring before you cases
pertaining to her interests. If, therefore, your opinion be, that death
must be the punishment of men convicted of these crimes, you will deter
us from endeavouring to bring anything of this kind before your
tribunal; and this being discovered, they will proceed with more
unrestrained boldness to accomplish speedily our destruction, when upon
us is imposed and enjoined the necessity of choosing rather to suffer
death at their hands, than to bring them to death by accusing them at
your bar. Disdain not, I beseech you, to accept this suggestion,
petition, and entreaty from me. For I do not think that you are
unmindful that I might have great boldness in addressing you, even were
I not a bishop, and even though your rank were much above what you now
hold. Meanwhile, let the Donatist heretics learn at once through the
edict of your Excellency that the laws passed against their error, which
they suppose and boastfully declare to be repealed, are still in force,
although even when they know this they may not be able to refrain in the
least degree from injuring us. You will, however, most effectively help
us to secure the fruit of our labours and dangers, if you take care that
the imperial laws for the restraining of their sect, which is full of
conceit and of impious pride, be so used that they may not appear either
to themselves or to others to be suffering hardship in any form for the
sake of truth and righteousness; but suffer them, when this is requested
at your hands, to be convinced and instructed by incontrovertible proofs
of things which are most certain, in public proceedings in the presence
of your Excellency or of inferior judges, in order that those who are
arrested by your command may themselves incline their stubborn will to
the better part, and may read these things profitably to others of their
party. For the pains bestowed are burdensome rather than really useful,
when men are only compelled, not persuaded by instruction, to forsake a
great evil and lay hold upon a great benefit.
