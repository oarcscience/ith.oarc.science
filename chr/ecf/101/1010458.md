*and Brother Rusticus, and to the Sisters Who are with Them, Augustin
and Those Who are with Him Send Greeting in the Lord.*</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCX-p5"></span>1. Good is the Lord, and to every place
extends His mercy, which comforts us by your love to us in Him. How much
He loves those who believe and hope in Him, and who both love Him and
love one another, and what blessings He keeps in store for them
hereafter, He proves most remarkably in this, that on the unbelieving,
the abandoned, and the perverse, whom He threatens with eternal fire, if
they persevere in their evil disposition to the end, He does in this
life bestow so many benefits, making “His sun to rise on the evil and on
the good,” “on the just and on the unjust,” <span
id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915.md) words in which, for the sake of
brevity, some instances are mentioned that many more may be suggested to
reflection; for who can reckon up how many gracious benefits the wicked
receive in this life from Him whom they despise? Amongst these, this is
one of great value, that by the experience of the occasional
afflictions, which like a good physician He mingles the pleasures of
this life, He admonishes them, if only they will give heed, to flee from
the wrath to come, and while they are in the way, that is, in this life,
to agree with the word of God, which they have made an adversary to
themselves by their wicked lives. What, then, is not bestowed in mercy
on men by the Lord God, since even affliction sent by Him is a blessing?
For prosperity is a gift of God when He comforts, adversity a gift of
God when He warns; and if He bestows these things, as I have said, even
on the wicked, what does He prepare for those who bear with one another?
Into this number you rejoice that through His grace you have been
gathered, “forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” <span
id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916.md) For there shall not be awanting
occasion for <span id="page_563">p. 563</span> <span
id="vii.1.CCX-Page_563"></span>your bearing one with another till God
shall have so purified you, that, death being “swallowed up in
victory,” <span id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917.md) “God shall be all
in all.” <span id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918.md)

<span id="vii.1.CCX-p10"></span>2. We ought never, indeed, to take
pleasure in quarrels; but however averse we may be to them, they
occasionally either arise from love, or put it to the test. For how
difficult is it to find any one willing to be reproved; and where is the
wise man of whom it is said, “Rebuke a wise man, and he will love
thee”? <span id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919.md) But are we on that
account not to reprove and find fault with a brother, to prevent him
from going down through false security to death? For it is a common and
frequent experience, that when a brother is found fault with he is
mortified at the time, and resists and contradicts his friend, but
afterwards reconsiders the matter in silence alone with God, where he is
not afraid of giving offence to men by submitting to correction, but is
afraid of offending God by refusing to be reformed, and thenceforward
refrains from doing that for which he has been justly reproved; and in
proportion as he hates his sin, he loves the brother whom he feels to
have been the enemy of his sin. But if he belong to the number of those
of whom it is said, “Reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee,” <span
id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920.md) the quarrel does not arise from
love on the part of the reproved, but it exercises and tests the love of
the reprover; for he does not return hatred for hatred, but the love
which constrains him to find fault endures unmoved, even when he who is
found fault with requites it with hatred. But if the reprover renders
evil for evil to the man who takes offence at being reproved, he was not
worthy to reprove another, but evidently deserves to be himself
reproved. Act upon these principles, so that either quarrels may not
arise, or, if they do arise, may quickly terminate in peace. Be more
earnest to dwell in concord than to vanquish each other in controversy.
For as vinegar corrodes a vessel if it remain long in it, so anger
corrodes the heart if it is cherished till the morrow. These things,
therefore, observe, and the God of peace shall be with you. Pray also
unitedly for us, that we may cheerfully practise the good advices which
we give to you.
