<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 426.)

<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p3.1"></span>To Palatinus, My Well-Beloved Lord and
Son, Most Tenderly Longed For, Augustin Sends Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p4"></span>1. Your life of eminent fortitude and
fruitfulness towards the Lord our God has brought to us great joy. For
“you have made choice of instruction from your youth upwards, that you
may still find wisdom even to grey hairs;” <span
id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) for “wisdom is the grey hair unto
men, and an unspotted life is old age;” <span
id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md) which may the Lord, who knoweth how
to give good gifts unto His children, give to you asking, seeking,
knocking. <span id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939.md) Although you have
many counsellors and many counsels to direct you in the path which leads
to eternal glory, and although, above all, you have the grace of Christ,
which has so effectually spoken in saving power in your heart,
nevertheless we also, as in duty bound by the love which we owe to you,
offer to you, in hereby reciprocating your salutation, some words of
counsel, designed not to awaken you as one hindered by sloth or sleep,
but to stimulate and quicken you in the race which you are already
running.

<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p8"></span>2. You require wisdom, my son, for
stedfastness in this race, as it was under the influence of wisdom that
you entered on it at first. Let this then be “a part of your wisdom, to
know whose gift it is.” <span id="fr_2940"></span>[2941](#fn_2940.md)
“Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him, and He shall bring it
to pass: and He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
thy judgment as the noonday.” <span id="fr_2941"></span>[2942](#fn_2941.md)
“He will make straight thy path, and guide thy steps in peace.” <span
id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942.md) As you despised your prospects of
greatness in this world, lest you should glory in the abundance of
riches which you had begun to covet after the manner of the children of
this world, so now, in taking up the yoke of the Lord and His burden,
let not your confidence be in your own strength; so shall “His yoke be
easy, and His burden light.” <span id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943.md)
For in the book of Psalms those are alike censured “who trust in their
strength,” and “who boast themselves in the multitude of their
riches.” <span id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md) Therefore, as
formerly you did not seek glory in riches, but most wisely despised that
which you had begun to desire, so now be on your guard against insidious
temptation to trust in your strength; for you are but man, and “cursed
is every one that trusteth in man.” <span
id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md) But by all means trust in God with
your whole heart, and He will Himself be your strength, wherein you may
trust with piety and thankfulness, and to Him you may say with humility
and boldness, “I will love thee, O Lord, my strength; <span
id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946.md) because even the love of God,
which, when it is perfect, “casteth out fear,” <span
id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947.md) is shed abroad in our hearts, not
by our strength, that is, by any human power, but, as the apostle says,
“by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.” <span
id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md)

<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p18"></span>3. “Watch, therefore, and pray that
you enter not into temptation.” <span
id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949.md) Such prayer is indeed in itself an
admonition to you that you need the help of the Lord, and that you ought
not to rest upon yourself your hope of living well. For now you pray,
not that you may obtain the riches and honours of this present world, or
any unsubstantial human possession, but that you may not enter into
temptation, a thing which would not be asked in prayer if a man could
accomplish it for himself by his own will. Wherefore we would not pray
that we may not enter into temptation if our own will sufficed for our
protection and yet if the will to avoid temptation were wanting to us,
we could not so pray. It may, therefore, be present with us to
will, <span id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) when we have through
his own gift been made wise, but we must pray that we may be able to
perform that which we have so willed. In the fact that you have begun to
exercise this true wisdom, you have reason to give thanks. “For what
have you which you have not received? But if you have received it,
beware that you boast not as if you had not received it,” <span
id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md) that is, as if you could have had
it of yourself. Knowing, however, whence you have received it, ask Him
by whose gift it was begun to grant that it may be perfected. “Work out
your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God that worketh
in you, both to will and to do, of His good pleasure;” <span
id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952.md) for “the will is prepared by
God,” <span id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) and “the steps of a
good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delighteth in his way.” <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) Holy meditation on these things
will preserve you, so that your wisdom shall be piety, that is, that by
God’s gift you shall be good, and not ungrateful for the grace of
Christ.

<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p25"></span>4. Your parents, unfeignedly
rejoicing with you in the better hope which in the Lord you have begun
to cherish, are longing earnestly for your presence. But whether you be
absent from us or present with us in the body, we desire to have you
with us in the one Spirit by whom love <span id="page_572">p. 572</span>
<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-Page_572"></span>is shed abroad in our hearts,
so that, in whatever place our bodies may sojourn, our spirits may be in
no degree sundered from each other.

<span id="vii.1.CCXVIII-p26"></span>We have most thankfully received the
cloaks of goat’s-hair cloth <span id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md)
which you sent to us, in which gift you have yourself anticipated me in
admonition as to the duty of being often engaged in prayer, and of
practising humility in our supplications.
