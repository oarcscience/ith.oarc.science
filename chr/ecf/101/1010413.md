<span id="vii.1.CXVI-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.1.CXVI-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXVI-p3.1"></span>To Generosus, My Noble and Justly
Distinguished Lord, My Honoured and Much-Loved Son, Augustin Sends
Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXVI-p4"></span>Although the praises and favourable
report of your administration and your own illustrious good name always
give me the greatest pleasure because of the love which we feel due to
your merit and to your benevolence, on no occasion have I hitherto been
burdensome to your Excellency as an intercessor requesting any favour
from you, my much-loved lord and justly-honoured son. When, however,
your Excellency has learned from the letters which I have sent to my
venerable brother and colleague, Fortunatus, what has occurred in the
town in which I serve the Church of God, your kind heart will at once
perceive the necessity under which I have been constrained to trespass
by this petition on your time, already fully occupied. I am perfectly
assured that, cherishing towards us the feeling which, in the name of
Christ, we are fully warranted to expect, you will act in this matter as
becomes not only an upright, but also a Christian magistrate.
