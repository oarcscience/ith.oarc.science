<span id="vii.1.XV-p2"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.XV-p2.1"></span>Letter XV.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XV-p3"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XV-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 390.)

<span id="vii.1.XV-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XV-p4.1"></span>To Romanianus Augustin Sends Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XV-p5"></span>1. This letter indicates a scarcity of
paper, <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) but not so as to
testify that parchment is plentiful here. My ivory tablets I used in the
letter which I sent to your uncle. You will more readily excuse this
scrap of parchment, because what I wrote to him could not be delayed,
and I thought that not to write to you for want of better material would
be most absurd. But if any tablets of mine are with you, I request you
to send them to meet a case of this kind. I have written something, as
the Lord has deigned to enable me, concerning the Catholic religion,
which before my coming I wish to send to you, if my paper does not fail
me in the meantime. For you will receive with indulgence any kind of
writing from the office of the brethren who are with me. As to the
manuscripts of which you speak, I have entirely forgotten them, except
the books *de Oratore*; but I could not have written anything better
than that you should take such of them as you please, and I am still of
the same mind; for at this distance I know not what else I can do in the
matter.

<span id="vii.1.XV-p7"></span>2. It gave me very great pleasure that in
your <span id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span
id="vii.1.XV-Page_233"></span>last letter you desired to make me a
sharer of your joy at home; but

<span id="vii.1.XV-p8"></span>“Wouldst thou have me forget how soon the
deep,

<span id="vii.1.XV-p9"></span>So tranquil now, may wear another face,

<span id="vii.1.XV-p10"></span>And rouse these slumbering waves?” <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md)

<span id="vii.1.XV-p12"></span>Yet I know you would not have me forget
this, nor are you yourself unmindful of it. Wherefore, if some leisure
is granted you for more profound meditation, improve this divine
blessing. For when these things fall to our lot, we should not only
congratulate ourselves, but show our gratitude to those to whom we owe
them; for if in the stewardship of temporal blessings we act in a manner
that is just and kind, and with the moderation and sobriety of spirit
which befits the transient nature of these possessions,—if they are held
by us without laying hold on us, are multiplied without entangling us,
and serve us without bringing us into bondage, such conduct entitles us
to the recompense of eternal blessings. For by Him who is the Truth it
was said: “If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s,
who will give you that which is your own?” Let us therefore disengage
ourselves from care about the passing things of time; let us seek the
blessings that are imperishable and sure; let us soar above our worldly
possessions. The bee does not the less need its wings when it has
gathered an abundant store; for if it sink in the honey it dies.
