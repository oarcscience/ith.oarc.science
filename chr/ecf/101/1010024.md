id="vi.I_1.VIII-p2.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—That When a Boy He Learned to
Speak, Not by Any Set Method, But from the Acts and Words of His
Parents.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.VIII-p3"></span>13. Did I not, then, growing out of the
state of infancy, come to boyhood, or rather did it not come to me, and
succeed to infancy? Nor did my infancy depart (for whither went it?);
and yet it did no longer abide, for I was no longer an infant that could
not speak, but a chattering boy. I remember this, and I afterwards
observed how I first learned to speak, for my elders did not teach me
words in any set method, as they did letters afterwards; but myself,
when I was unable to say all I wished and to whomsoever I desired, by
means of the whimperings and broken utterances and various motions of my
limbs, which I used to enforce my wishes, repeated the sounds in my
memory by the mind, O my God, which Thou gavest me. When they called
anything by name, and moved the body towards it while they spoke, I saw
and gathered that the thing they wished to point out was called by the
name they then uttered; and that they did mean this was made plain by
the motion of the body, even by the natural language of all nations
expressed by the countenance, glance of the eye, movement of other
members, and by the sound of the voice indicating the affections of the
mind, as it seeks, possesses, rejects, or avoids. So it was that by
frequently hearing words, in duly placed sentences, I gradually gathered
what things they were the signs of; and having formed my mouth to the
utterance of these signs, I thereby expressed my will. <span

the signs by which we express our wishes, and advanced deeper into the
stormy fellowship of human life, depending the while on the authority of
parents, and the beck of elders.
