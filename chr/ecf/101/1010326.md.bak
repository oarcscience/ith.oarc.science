<span id="vii.1.XIX-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XIX-p3.1"></span>To Gaius Augustin Sends Greeting.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XIX-p4"></span>1. Words cannot express the pleasure with
which the recollection of you filled my heart after I parted with you,
and has often filled my heart since then. For I remember that,
notwithstanding the amazing ardour which pervaded your inquiries after
truth, the bounds of proper moderation in debate were never transgressed
by you. I shall not easily find any one who is more eager in putting
questions, and at the same time more patient in hearing answers, than
you approved yourself. Gladly therefore would I spend much time in
converse with you; for the time thus spent, however much it might be,
would not seem long. But what avails it to discuss the hindrances on
account of which it is difficult for us to enjoy such converse? Enough
that it is exceedingly difficult. Perhaps at some future period it may
be made very easy; may God grant this! Meanwhile it is otherwise. I have
given to the brother by whom I have sent this letter the charge of
submitting all my writings to your eminent wisdom and charity, that they
may be read by you. For nothing written by me will find in you a
reluctant reader; for I know the goodwill which you cherish towards me.
Let me say, however, that if, on reading these things, you approve of
them, and perceive them to be true, you must not consider them to be
mine otherwise than as given to me; and you are at liberty to turn to
that same source whence proceeds also the power given you to appreciate
their truth. For no one discerns the truth of that which he reads from
anything which is in the mere manuscript, or in the writer, but rather
by something within himself, if the light of truth, shining with a
clearness beyond what is men’s common lot, and very far removed from the
darkening influence of the body, has penetrated his own mind. If,
however, you discover some things which are false and deserve to be
rejected, I would have you know that these things have fallen as dew
from the mists of human frailty, and these you are to reckon as truly
mine. I would exhort you to persevere in seeking the truth, were it not
that I seem to see the mouth of your heart already opened wide to drink
it in. I would also exhort you to cling with manly tenacity to the truth
which you have learned, were it not that you already manifest in the
clearest manner that you possess strength of mind and fixedness of
purpose. For all that lives within you has, in the short time of our
fellowship, revealed itself to me, almost as if the bodily veil had been
rent asunder. And surely the merciful providence of our God can in no
wise permit a man so good and so remarkably gifted as you are to be an
alien from the flock of Christ.
