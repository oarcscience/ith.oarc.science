id="vi.I_1.XII-p2.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Being Compelled, He Gave His
Attention to Learning; But Fully Acknowledges that This Was the Work of
God.</span>

<span id="vi.I_1.XII-p3"></span>19. But in this my childhood (which was
far less dreaded for me than youth) I had no love of learning, and hated
to be forced to it, yet was I forced to it notwithstanding; and this was
well done towards me, but I did not well, for I would not have learned
had I not been compelled. For no man doth well against his will, even if
that which he doth be well. Neither did they who forced me do well, but
<span id="page_51">p. 51</span> <span id="vi.I_1.XII-Page_51"></span>the
good that was done to me came from Thee, my God. For they considered not
in what way I should employ what they forced me to learn, unless to
satisfy the inordinate desires of a rich beggary and a shameful glory.
But Thou, by whom the very hairs of our heads are numbered, <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) didst use for my good the error of all
who pressed me to learn; and my own error in willing not to learn, didst
Thou make use of for my punishment—of which I, being so small a boy and
so great a sinner, was not unworthy. Thus by the instrumentality of
those who did not well didst Thou well for me; and by my own sin didst
Thou justly punish me. For it is even as Thou hast appointed, that every
inordinate affection should bring its own punishment. <span
