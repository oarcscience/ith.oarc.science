Past and Future.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XVII-p2"></span>2. I ask, Father, I do not affirm. O my
God, rule and guide me. “Who is there who can say to me that there are
not three times (as we learned when boys, and as we have taught boys),
the past, present, and future, but only present, because these two are
not? Or are they also; but when from future it becometh present, cometh
it forth from some secret place, and when from the present it becometh
past, doth it retire into anything secret? For where have they, who have
foretold future things, seen these things, if as yet they are not? For
that which is not cannot be seen. And they who relate things past could
not relate them as true, did they not perceive them in their mind. Which
things, if they were not, they could in no wise be discerned. There are
therefore things both future and past.
