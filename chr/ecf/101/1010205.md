id="vi.XI.IV-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Heaven and Earth Cry Out that They
Have Been Created by God.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.IV-p2"></span>6. Behold, the heaven and earth are; they
proclaim that they were made, for they are changed and varied. Whereas
whatsoever hath not been made, and yet hath being, hath nothing in it
which there was not before; this is what it is to be changed and varied.
They also proclaim that they made not themselves; “therefore we are,
because we have been made; we were not therefore before we were, so that
we could have made ourselves.” And the voice of those that speak is in
itself an evidence. Thou, therefore, Lord, didst make these things; Thou
who art beautiful, for they are beautiful; Thou who art good, for they
are good; Thou who art, for they are. Nor even so are they beautiful,
nor good, nor are they, as Thou their Creator art; compared with whom
they are neither beautiful, nor good, nor are at all. <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025) These things we know, thanks be to
Thee. And our knowledge, compared with Thy knowledge, is ignorance.

<span id="vi.XI.IV-p3"></span> It was the doctrine of Aristotle that
excellence of character is the proper object of love, and in proportion
as we recognise such excellence in others are we attracted to become
like them (see Sidgwick’s *Methods of Ethics*, book iv. c. 5, sec. 4).
If this be true of the creature, how much more should it be so of the
Creator, who is the perfection of all that we can conceive of goodness
and truth. Compare *De Trin.* viii. 3–6, *De Vera Relig.* 57, and an
extract from Athanese Coquerel in Archbishop Thomson’s *Bampton
Lectures*, note 73.
