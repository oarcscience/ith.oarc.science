<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CXLV-p1.1"></span>Letter CXLV.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 412 or 413.)

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CXLV-p3.1"></span>To Anastasius, My Holy and Beloved Lord and
Brother, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p4"></span>1. A most satisfactory opportunity of
saluting your genuine worth is furnished by our brethren Lupicinus and
Concordialis, honourable servants of God, from whom, even without my
writing, you might learn all that is going on among us here. But
knowing, as I do, how much you love us in Christ, because of your
knowing how warmly your love is reciprocated by us in Him, I was sure
that it might have disappointed you if you had seen them, and could not
but know that they had come directly from us, and were most intimately
united in friendship with us, and yet had received with them no letter
from me. Besides this, I am owing you a reply, for I am not aware of
having written to you since I received your last letter; so great are
the cares by which I am encumbered and distracted, that I know not
whether I have written or not before now.

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p5"></span>2. We desire eagerly to know how you
are, and whether the Lord has given you some rest, so far as in this
world He can bestow it; for “if one member be honoured, all the members
rejoice with it;” <span id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585.md) and so it
is almost always our experience, that when, in the midst of our
anxieties, we turn our thoughts to some of our brethren placed in a
condition of comparative rest, we are in no small measure revived, as if
in them we ourselves enjoyed a more peaceful and tranquil life. At the
same time, when vexatious cares are multiplied in this uncertain life,
they compel us to long for the everlasting rest. For this world is more
dangerous to us in pleasant than in painful hours, and is to be guarded
against more when it allures us to love it than when it warns and
constrains us to despise it. For although “all that is in the world” is
“the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
life,” <span id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586.md) nevertheless, even in
the case of men who prefer to these the things which are spiritual,
unseen, and eternal, the sweetness of earthly things insinuates itself
into our affections, and accompanies our steps on the path of duty with
its seductive allurements. For the violence with which present things
acquire sway over our weakness is exactly proportioned to the superior
value by which future things command our love. And oh that those who
have learned to observe and bewail this may succeed in overcoming and
escaping from this power of terrestrial things! Such victory and <span
id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span
id="vii.1.CXLV-Page_496"></span>emancipation cannot, without God’s
grace, be achieved by the human will, which is by no means to be called
free so long as it is subject to prevailing and enslaving lusts; “For of
whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.” <span
id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587.md) And the Son of God has Himself
said, “If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” <span
id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p10"></span>3. The law, therefore, by teaching and
commanding what cannot be fulfilled without grace, demonstrates to man
his weakness, in order that the weakness thus proved may resort to the
Saviour, by whose healing the will may be able to do what in its
feebleness it found impossible. So, then, the law brings us to faith,
faith obtains the Spirit in fuller measure, the Spirit sheds love abroad
in us, and love fulfils the law. For this reason the law is called a
“schoolmaster,” <span id="fr_2589"></span>[2590](#fn_2589.md) under whose
threatenings and severity “whosoever shall call upon the name of the
Lord shall be delivered.” <span id="fr_2590"></span>[2591](#fn_2590.md) But
how shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?” <span
id="fr_2591"></span>[2592](#fn_2591.md) Wherefore unto them that believe
and call on Him the quickening Spirit is given, lest the letter without
the Spirit should kill them. <span id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592.md)
But by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us, the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts, <span id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593.md) so that
the words of the same apostle, “Love is the fulfilling of the
law,” <span id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594.md) are realized. So the
law is good to the man who uses it lawfully; <span
id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595.md) and he uses it lawfully who,
understanding wherefore it was given, betakes himself, under the
pressure of its threatenings, to grace, which sets him free. Whoever
unthankfully despises this grace, by which the ungodly are justified,
and trusts in his own strength, as if he thereby could fulfil the law,
being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish his
own righteousness, is not submitting himself to the righteousness of
God; <span id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) and thus the law becomes
to him not a help to pardon, but the bond fastening his guilt to him.
Not that the law is evil, but because sin worketh death in such persons
by that which is good. <span id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md) For by
occasion of the commandment he sins more grievously who, by the
commandment, knows how evil are the sins which he commits.

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p20"></span>4. In vain, however, does any one think
himself to have gained the victory over sin, if, through nothing but
fear of punishment, he refrains from sin; because, although the outward
action to which an evil desire prompts him is not performed, the evil
desire itself within the man is an enemy unsubdued. And who is found
innocent in God’s sight who is willing to do the sin which is forbidden
if you only remove the punishment which is feared? And consequently,
even in the volition itself, he is guilty of sin who wishes to do what
is unlawful, but refrains from doing it because it cannot be done with
impunity; for, so far as he is concerned, he would prefer that there
were no righteousness forbidding and punishing sins. And assuredly, if
he would prefer that there should be no righteousness, who can doubt
that he would if he could abolish it altogether? How, then, can that man
be called righteous who is such an enemy to righteousness that, if he
had the power, he would abolish its authority, that he might not be
subject to its threatenings or its penalties? He, then, is an enemy to
righteousness who refrains from sin only through fear of punishment; but
he will become the friend of righteousness if through love of it he sin
not, for then he will be really afraid to sin. For the man who only
fears the flames of hell is afraid not of sinning, but of being burned;
but the man who hates sin as much as he hates hell is afraid to sin.
This is the “fear of the Lord,” which “is pure, enduring for
ever.” <span id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md) For the fear of
punishment has torment, and is not in love; and love, when it is
perfect, casts it out. <span id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p23"></span>5. Moreover, every one hates sin just
in proportion as he loves righteousness; which he will be enabled to do
not through the law putting him in fear by the letter of its
prohibitions, but by the Spirit healing him by grace. Then that is done
which the apostle enjoins in the admonition, “I speak after the manner
of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded
your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even
so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto
holiness.” <span id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md) For what is the
force of the conjunctions “as” and “even so,” if it be not this: “As no
fear compelled you to sin, but the desire for it, and the pleasure taken
in sin, even so let not the fear of punishment drive you to a life of
righteousness; but let the pleasure found in righteousness and the love
you bear to it draw you to practise it”? And even this is, as it seems
to me, a righteousness, so to speak, somewhat mature, but not perfect.
For he would not have prefaced the admonition with the words, “I speak
after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh,” had
there not been something else that ought to have been said if they had
been by that time able to bear it. For surely more devoted service is
due to righteousness <span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="vii.1.CXLV-Page_497"></span>than men are wont to yield to sin. For
pain of body restrains men, if not from the desire of sin, at least from
the commission of sinful actions; and we should not easily find any one
who would openly commit a sin procuring to him an impure and unlawful
gratification, if it was certain that the penalty of torture would
immediately follow the crime. But righteousness ought to be so loved
that not even bodily sufferings should hinder us from doing its works,
but that, even when we are in the hands of cruel enemies, our good works
should so shine before men that those who are capable of taking pleasure
therein may glorify our Father who is in heaven. <span
id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p26"></span>6. Hence it comes that that most
devoted lover of righteousness exclaims, “Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written, For Thy
sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the
slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through
Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor
angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord.” <span id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) Observe how he does
not say simply, “Who shall separate us from Christ?” but, indicating
that by which we cling to Christ, he says, “Who shall separate us from
the love of Christ?” We cling to Christ, then, by love, not by fear of
punishment. Again, after having enumerated those things which seem to be
sufficiently fierce, but have not sufficient force to effect a
separation, he has, in the conclusion, called that the love of God which
he had previously spoken of as the love of Christ. And what is this
“love of Christ” but love of righteousness? for it is said of Him that
He “is made of God unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is written, He
that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md) As, therefore he is superlatively
wicked who is not deterred even by the penalty of bodily sufferings from
the vile works of sordid pleasure, so is he superlatively righteous who
is not restrained even by the fear of bodily sufferings from the holy
works of most glorious love.

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p29"></span>7. This love of God, which must be
maintained by unremitting, devout meditation, “is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us,” <span
id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604.md) so that he who glories in it must
glory in the Lord. Forasmuch, therefore, as we feel ourselves to be poor
and destitute of that love by which the law is most truly fulfilled, we
ought not to expect and demand its riches from our own indigence, but to
ask, seek, and knock in prayer, that He with whom is “the fountain of
life” “may satisfy us abundantly with the fatness of His house, and make
us drink of the river of His pleasures,” <span
id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605.md) so that, watered and revived by its
full flood, we may not only escape from being swallowed up by sorrow,
but may even “glory in tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh
patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope
maketh not ashamed;”—not that we can do this of ourselves, but “because
the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is
given to us.” <span id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606.md)

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p33"></span>8. It has been a pleasure to me to say,
at least by a letter, these things which I could not say when you were
present. I write them, not in reference to yourself, for you do not
affect high things, but are contented with that which is lowly, <span
id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607.md) but in reference to some who
arrogate too much to the human will, imagining that, the law being
given, the will is of its own strength sufficient to fulfil that law,
though not assisted by any grace imparted by the Holy Spirit, in
addition to instruction in the law; and by their reasonings they
persuade the wretched and impoverished weakness of man to believe that
it is not our duty to pray that we may not enter into temptation. Not
that they dare openly to say this; but this is, whether they acknowledge
it or not, an inevitable consequence of their doctrine. <span
id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608.md) For wherefore is it said to us,
“Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation;” <span
id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609.md) and wherefore was it that, when He
was teaching us to pray, He prescribed, in accordance with this
injunction, the use of the petition “lead us not into temptation,” <span
id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610.md) if this be wholly in the power of
the will of man, and does not require the help of divine grace in order
to its accomplishment?

<span id="vii.1.CXLV-p38"></span>Why should I say more? Salute the
brethren who are with you, and pray for us, that we may be saved with
that salvation of which it is said, “They that are whole need not a
physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners.” <span id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611.md) Pray, therefore,
for us that we may be righteous,—an attainment wholly beyond a man’s
reach, unless he know righteousness and be willing to practise it, but
one which is immediately realized when he is perfectly willing; but this
full consent of his will can <span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="vii.1.CXLV-Page_498"></span>never be in him unless he is healed and
assisted by the grace of the Spirit.
