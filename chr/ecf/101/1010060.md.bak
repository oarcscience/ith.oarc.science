<span id="vi.IV.I-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IV.I-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—Concerning that Most Unhappy Time in
Which He, Being Deceived, Deceived Others; And Concerning the Mockers of
His Confession.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.I-p2"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.IV.I-p2.1"></span>During</span> this space of nine years, then,
from my nineteenth to my eight and twentieth year, we went on seduced
and seducing, deceived and deceiving, in divers lusts; publicly, by
sciences which they style “liberal”—secretly, with a falsity called
religion. Here proud, there superstitious, everywhere vain! Here,
striving after the emptiness of popular fame, even to theatrical
applauses, and poetic contests, and strifes for grassy garlands, and the
follies of shows and the intemperance of desire. There, seeking to be
purged from these our corruptions by carrying food to those who were
called “elect” and “holy,” out of which, in the laboratory of their
stomachs, they should make for us angels and gods, by whom we might be
delivered. <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) These things did I
follow eagerly, and practise with my friends—by me and with me deceived.
Let the arrogant, and such as have not been yet savingly cast down and
stricken by Thee, O my God, laugh at me; but notwithstanding I would
confess to Thee mine own shame in Thy praise. Bear with me, I beseech
Thee, and give me grace to retrace in my present remembrance the
circlings of my past errors, and to “offer to Thee the sacrifice of
thanksgiving.” <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) For what am I to
myself without Thee, but a guide to mine own downfall? Or what am I even
at the best, but one sucking Thy milk, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) and feeding upon Thee, the meat that
perisheth not? <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) But what kind of
man is any man, seeing that he is but a man? Let, then, the strong and
the mighty laugh at us, but let us who are “poor and needy” <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) confess unto Thee.

<span id="vi.IV.I-p3"></span> Augustin tells us that he went not beyond
the rank of a “hearer,” because he found the Manichæan teachers readier
in refuting others than in establishing their own views, and seems only
to have looked for some esoteric doctrine to have been disclosed to him
under their materialistic teaching as to God—viz. that He was an
unmeasured Light that extended all ways but one, infinitely (*Serm.* iv.
sec 5.)—rather than to have really accepted it.—*De Util. Cred. Præf.*
