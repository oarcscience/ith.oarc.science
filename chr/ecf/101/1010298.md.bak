id="vi.XIII.XXXII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Of the Particular Works of
God, More Especially of Man.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXII-p2"></span>47. Thanks to Thee, O Lord. We behold
the heaven and the earth, whether the corporeal <span id="page_206">p.
206</span> <span id="vi.XIII.XXXII-Page_206"></span>part, superior and
inferior, or the spiritual and corporeal creature; and in the
embellishment of these parts, whereof the universal mass of the world or
the universal creation consisteth, we see light made, and divided from
the darkness. We see the firmament of heaven, <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) whether the primary body of the
world between the spiritual upper waters and the corporeal lower waters,
or—because this also is called heaven—this expanse of air, through which
wander the fowls of heaven, between the waters which are in vapours
borne above them, and which in clear nights drop down in dew, and those
which being heavy flow along the earth. We behold the waters gathered
together through the plains of the sea; and the dry land both void and
formed, so as to be visible and compact, and the matter of herbs and
trees. We behold the lights shining from above,—the sun to serve the
day, the moon and the stars to cheer the night; and that by all these,
times should be marked and noted. We behold on every side a humid
element, fruitful with fishes, beasts, and birds; because the density of
the air, which bears up the flights of birds, is increased by the
exhalation of the waters. <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) We
behold the face of the earth furnished with terrestrial creatures, and
man, created after Thy image and likeness, in that very image and
likeness of Thee (that is, the power of reason and understanding) on
account of which he was set over all irrational creatures. And as in his
soul there is one power which rules by directing, another made subject
that it might obey, so also for the man was corporeally made a
woman, <span id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) who, in the mind of
her rational understanding should also have a like nature, in the sex,
however, of her body should be in like manner subject to the sex of her
husband, as the appetite of action is subjected by reason of the mind,
to conceive the skill of acting rightly. These things we behold, and
they are severally good, and all very good.

<span id="vi.XIII.XXXII-p5"></span> “‘Concipiendam,’ or the reading may
be ‘concupiscendam,’ according to St. Augustin’s interpretation of [Gen.
3.16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.XIII.XXXII-p5.1"></span>, in the *De Gen. con. Manich.* ii. 15.
‘As an instance hereof was woman made, who is in the order of things
made subject to the man; that what appears more evidently in two human
beings, the man and the woman, may be contemplated in the one, man; viz.
that the inward man, as it were manly reason, should have in subjection
the appetite of the soul, whereby we act through the bodily
members.’”—E. B. P.
