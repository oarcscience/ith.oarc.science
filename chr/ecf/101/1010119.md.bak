id="vi.VII.XI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—That Creatures are Mutable and
God Alone Immutable.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XI-p2"></span>17. And I viewed the other things below
Thee, and perceived that they neither altogether are, nor altogether are
not. They are, indeed, because they are from Thee; but are not, because
they are not what Thou art. For that truly is which remains
immutably. <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) It is good, then, for
me to cleave unto God, <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) for if I
remain not in Him, neither shall I in myself; but He, remaining in
Himself, reneweth all things. <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md)
And Thou art the Lord my God, since Thou standest not in need of my
goodness. <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md)

I AM (*De Nat. Boni*, 19): for *omnis mutatio facit non esse quod erat.*
Similarly, we find him speaking in his *De Mor. Manich.* (c. I.): “For
that exists in the highest sense of the word which continues always the
same, which is throughout like itself, which cannot in any part be
corrupted or changed, which is not subject to time, which admits of no
variation in its present as compared with its former condition. This is
existence in its true sense.” See also note 3, p. 158.
