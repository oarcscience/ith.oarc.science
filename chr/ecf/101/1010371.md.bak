of Veneration, and My Father and Colleague in the Priestly Office,
Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.*</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXV-p5"></span>1. Saluting your Excellency with the
respect due to your worth, and earnestly seeking an interest in your
prayers, I beg to submit to the consideration of your wisdom the case of
a certain Abundantius, ordained a presbyter in the domain of Strabonia,
belonging to my diocese. He had begun to be unfavourably reported of,
through his not walking in the way which becomes the servants of God;
and I being on this account alarmed, though not believing the rumours
without examination, was made more watchful of his conduct, and devoted
some pains to obtain, if possible, indisputable evidences of the evil
courses with which he was charged. The first thing which I ascertained
was, that he had embezzled the money of a countryman, entrusted to him
for religious purposes, and could give no satisfactory account of his
stewardship. The next thing proved against him, and admitted by his own
confession, was, that on Christmas day, on which the fast was observed
by the Church of Gippe as by all the other Churches, after taking leave
of his colleague the presbyter of Gippe, as if going to his own church
about 11 A.M., he remained, without having any ecclesiastic in his
company, in the same parish, and dined, supped, and spent the night in
the house of a woman of ill fame. It happened that lodging in the same
place was one of our clergy of Hippo, who had gone thither; and as the
facts were known beyond dispute to this witness, Abundantius could not
deny the charge. As to the things which he did deny, I left them to the
divine tribunal, passing sentence upon him only in regard to those
things which he had not been permitted to conceal. I was afraid to leave
him in charge of a Church, especially of one placed as his was, in the
very midst of rabid and barking heretics. And when he begged me to give
him a letter with a statement of his case to the presbyter of the parish
of Armema, in the district of Bulla, from which he had come to us, so as
to prevent any exaggerated suspicion there of his character, and in
order that he might there live, if possible, a more consistent life,
having no duties as a presbyter, I was moved by compassion to do as he
desired. At the same time, it was very specially incumbent on me to
submit to your wisdom these facts, lest any deception should be
practised upon you.

<span id="vii.1.LXV-p6"></span>2. I pronounced sentence in his case one
hundred days before Easter Sunday, which falls this year on the 7th of
April. I have taken care to acquaint you with the date, because of the
decree of Council, <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) which I
also did not conceal from him, but explained to him the law of the
Church, that if he thought anything could be done to reverse my
decision, unless he began proceedings with this view within a year, no
one would, after the lapse of that time, listen to his pleading. For my
own part, my lord most blessed, and father worthy of all veneration, I
assure you that if I did not think that these instances of vicious
conversation in an ecclesiastic, especially when accompanied with an
evil reputation, deserved <span id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span
id="vii.1.LXV-Page_323"></span>to be visited with the punishment
appointed by the Council, I would be compelled now to attempt to sift
things which cannot be known, and either to condemn the accused upon
doubtful evidence, or acquit him for want of proof. When a presbyter,
upon a day of fasting which was observed as such also in the place in
which he was, having taken leave of his colleague in the ministry in
that place, and being unattended by any ecclesiastic, ventured to tarry
in the house of a woman of ill fame, and to dine and sup and spend the
night there, it seemed to me, whatever others might think, that he
behoved to be deposed from his office, as I durst not commit to his
charge a Church of God. If it should so happen that a different opinion
be held by the ecclesiastical judges to whom he may appeal, seeing that
it has been decreed by the Council <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) that the decision of six bishops be
final in the case of a presbyter, let who will commit to him a Church
within his jurisdiction, I confess, for my own part, that I fear to
entrust any congregation whatever to persons like him, especially when
nothing in the way of general good character can be alleged as a reason
for excusing these delinquencies; lest, if he were to break forth into
some more ruinous wickedness, I should be compelled with sorrow to blame
myself for the harm done by his crime.
