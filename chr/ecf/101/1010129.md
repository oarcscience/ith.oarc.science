<span id="vi.VII.XXI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—What He Found in the Sacred
Books Which are Not to Be Found in Plato.</span>

<span id="vi.VII.XXI-p2"></span>27. Most eagerly, then, did I seize that
venerable writing of Thy Spirit, but more especally the Apostle
Paul; <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) and those difficulties
vanished away, in which he at one time appeared to me to contradict
himself, and the text of his discourse not to agree with the testimonies
of the Law and the Prophets. And the face of that pure speech appeared
to me one and the same; and I learned to “rejoice with trembling.” <span
id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md) So I commenced, and found that
whatsoever truth I had there read was declared here with the
recommendation of Thy grace; that he who sees may not so glory as if he
had not received <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) not only that
which he sees, but also that he can see (for what hath he which he hath
not received?); and that he may not only be admonished to see Thee, who
art ever the same, but also may be healed, to hold Thee; and that he who
from afar off is not able to see, may still walk on the way by which he
may reach, behold, and possess Thee. For though a man “delight in the
law of God after the inward man,” <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md) what shall he do with that other law
in his members which warreth against the law of his mind, and bringeth
him into captivity to the law of sin, which is in his members? <span
id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md) For Thou art righteous, O Lord, but we
have sinned and committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) and Thy hand is grown heavy upon us,
and we are justly delivered over unto that ancient sinner, the governor
of death; for he induced our will to be like his will, whereby he
remained not in Thy truth. What shall “wretched man” do? “Who shall
deliver him from the body of this death,” but Thy grace only, “through
Jesus ‘Christ our Lord,’” <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md) whom
Thou hast begotten co-eternal, and createdst <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) in the begin<span id="page_115">p.
115</span> <span id="vi.VII.XXI-Page_115"></span>ning of Thy ways, in
whom the Prince of this world found nothing worthy of death, <span
id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) yet killed he Him, and the handwriting
which was contrary to us was blotted out? <span
id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) This those writings contain not. Those
pages contain not the expression of this piety,—the tears of confession,
Thy sacrifice, a troubled spirit, “a broken and a contrite heart,” <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md) the salvation of the people, the
espoused city, <span id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) the earnest of
the Holy Ghost, <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) the cup of our
redemption. <span id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) No man sings there,
Shall not my soul be subject unto God? For of Him cometh my salvation,
for He is my God and my salvation, my defender, I shall not be further
moved. <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md) No one there hears Him
calling, “Come unto me all ye that labour.” They scorn to learn of Him,
because He is meek and lowly of heart; <span
id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581.md) for “Thou hast hid those things from
the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.” <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md) For it is one thing, from the
mountain’s wooded summit to see the land of peace, <span
id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) and not to find the way thither,—in
vain to attempt impassable ways, opposed and waylaid by fugitives and
deserters, under their captain the “lion” <span
id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md) and the “dragon;” <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) and another to keep to the way that
leads thither, guarded by the host of the heavenly general, where they
rob not who have deserted the heavenly army, which they shun as torture.
These things did in a wonderful manner sink into my bowels, when I read
that “least of Thy apostles,” <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md)
and had reflected upon Thy works, and feared greatly.

<span id="vi.VII.XXI-p3"></span> Literally, “The venerable *pen* of Thy
Spirit (*<span class="c75"><span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p3.1"></span>Logos</span>*); words which would seem to
imply a belief on Augustin’s part in a verbal inspiration of Scripture.
That he gave Scripture the highest honour as God’s inspired word is
clear not only from this, but other passages in his works. It is equally
clear, however, that he gave full recognition to the human element in
the word. See *De Cons. Evang.* ii. 12, where both these aspects are
plainly discoverable. Compare also *ibid*. c. 24.

<span id="vi.VII.XXI-p10"></span> [Prov.
8.22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.1"></span>, as quoted from the old Italic version. It
must not be understood to teach that the Lord is a creature. (1)
Augustin, as indeed is implied in the *Confessions* above, understands
the passage of the incarnation of Christ, and in his *De Doct. Christ.*
i. 38, he distinctly so applies it: “For Christ…desiring to be Himself
the Way to those who are just setting out, determined to take a fleshly
body. Whence also that expression, ‘The Lord created me in the beginning
of his Way,’—that is, that those who wish to come might begin their
journey in Him.” Again, in a remarkable passage in his *De Trin.* i. 24,
he makes a similar application of the words: “According to the form of a
servant, it is said, ‘The Lord created me in the beginning of His ways.’
Because, according to the form of God, he said, ‘I am the Truth;’ and,
according to the form of a servant, ‘I am the Way.’” (2) Again,
*creasti* is from the LXX. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.2"></span>ἔκτισε</span>, which is that version’s
rendering in this verse of the Hebrew <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.3"></span> קָנָנִי</span>. The *Vulgate*, more
correctly translating from the Hebrew, gives *possedit*, thus
corresponding to our English version, “The Lord *possessed* me,” etc.
The LXX. would appear to have made an erroneous rendering here, for
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.4"></span>κτίζω</span> is
generally in that version the equivalent for <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.5"></span>בָרָא</span>, “to create,” while <span
class="Hebrew"><span id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.6"></span>קָגָה</span> is
usually rendered by <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.7"></span>κτάομαι</span>, “to possess,” “to acquire.”
It is true that Gesenius supposes that in a few passages, and [Prov.
viii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.8"></span> among them, <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p10.9"></span>קָנָה</span> should be rendered “to
create;” but these very passages our authorized version renders “to
get,” or “to possess;” and, as Dr. Tregelles observes, referring to
M’Call on the Divine Sonship, “in all passages cited for that sense, ‘to
possess’ appears to be the true meaning.”

15.9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.VII.XXI-p23.1"></span>. In giving an account, remarks Pusey, of
this period to his friend and patron Romanianus, St. Augustin seems to
have blended together this and the history of his completed conversion,
which was also wrought in connection with words in the same apostle, but
the account of which he uniformly suppresses, for fear, probably, of
injuring the individual to whom he was writing (see on book ix. sec. 4,
note, below). “Since that vehement flame which was about to seize me as
yet was not, I thought that by which I was slowly kindled was the very
greatest. When lo! certain books, when they had distilled a very few
drops of most precious unguent on that tiny flame, it is past belief,
Romanianus, past belief, and perhaps past what even you believe of me
(and what could I say more?), nay, to myself also is it past belief,
what a conflagration of myself they lighted. What ambition, what human
show, what empty love of fame, or, lastly, what incitement or band of
this mortal life could hold me then? I turned speedily and wholly back
into myself. I cast but a glance, I confess, as one passing on, upon
that religion which was implanted into us as boys, and interwoven with
our very inmost selves; but she drew me unknowing to herself. So then,
stumbling, hurrying, hesitating, I seized the Apostle Paul; ‘for never,’
said I, ‘could they have wrought such things, or lived as it is plain
they did live, if their writings and arguments were opposed to this so
high good.’ I read the whole most intently and carefully. But then,
never so little light having been shed thereon, such a countenance of
wisdom gleamed upon me, that if I could exhibit it—I say not to you, who
ever hungeredst after her, though unknown—but to your very adversary
(see book vi. sec. 24, note, above), casting aside and abandoning
whatever now stimulates him so keenly to whatsoever pleasures, he would,
amazed, panting, enkindled, fly to her Beauty” (*Con. Acad.* ii. 5).
