id="vi.X.II-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—That All Things are Manifest to
God. That Confession Unto Him is Not Made by the Words of the Flesh, But
of the Soul, and the Cry of Reflection.</span>

<span id="vi.X.II-p2"></span>2. And from Thee, O Lord, unto whose eyes
the depths of man’s conscience are naked, <span
id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) what in me could be hidden though I
were unwilling to confess to Thee? For so should I hide Thee from
myself, not myself from Thee. But now, because my groaning witnesseth
that I am dissatisfied with myself, Thou shinest forth, and satisfiest,
and art beloved and desired; that I may blush for myself, and renounce
myself, and choose Thee, and may neither please Thee nor myself, except
in Thee. To Thee, then, O Lord, am I manifest, whatever I am, and with
what fruit I may confess unto Thee I have spoken. Nor do I it with words
and sounds of the flesh, but with the words of the soul, and that cry of
reflection which Thine ear knoweth. For when I am wicked, to confess to
Thee is naught but to be dissatisfied with myself; but when I am truly
devout, it is naught but not to attribute it to myself, because Thou, O
Lord, dost “bless the righteous;” <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) but first Thou justifiest him
“ungodly.” <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) My confession,
therefore, O my God, in Thy sight, is made unto Thee silently, and yet
not silently. For in noise it is silent, in affection it cries aloud.
For neither do I give utterance to anything that is right unto men which
Thou hast not heard from me before, nor dost Thou hear anything of the
kind from me which Thyself saidst not first unto me.
