<span id="vi.XIII.XXVII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXVII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Many are Ignorant as to
This, and Ask for Miracles, Which are Signified Under the Names Of
“Fishes” And “Whales.”</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXVII-p2"></span>42. Therefore will I speak before
Thee, O Lord, what is true, when ignorant men and infidels (for the
initiating and gaining of whom the sacraments of initiation and great
works of miracles are necessary, <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) which we believe to be signified
under the name of “fishes” and “whales”) undertake that Thy servants
should be bodily refreshed, or should be otherwise succoured for this
present life, although they may be ignorant wherefore this is to be
done, and to what end; neither do the former feed the latter, nor the
latter the former; for neither do the one perform these things through a
holy and right intent, nor do the other rejoice in the gifts of those
who behold not as yet the fruit. For on that is the mind fed wherein it
is gladdened. And, therefore, fishes and whales are not fed on such food
as the earth bringeth not forth until it had been separated and divided
from the bitterness of the waters of the sea.

<span id="vi.XIII.XXVII-p3"></span> We have already referred (p. 69,
note 5, above) to the cessation of miracles. Augustin has a beautiful
passage in *Serm.* ccxliv. 8, on the evidence which we have in the
spread of Christianity—it doing for us what miracles did for the early
Church. Compare also *De* *Civ. Dei*, xxii. 8. And he frequently
alludes, as, for example, *in Ps.* cxxx., to “charity” being more
desirable than the power of working miracles.
