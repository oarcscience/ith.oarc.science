<span id="vi.VIII.VI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VIII.VI-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Pontitianus’ Account of Antony,
the Founder of Monachism, and of Some Who Imitated Him.</span>

<span id="vi.VIII.VI-p2"></span>13. And how, then, Thou didst deliver me
out of the bonds of carnal desire, wherewith I was most firmly fettered,
and out of the drudgery of worldly business, will I now declare and
confess unto Thy name, “O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.” <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) Amid increasing anxiety, I was
transacting my usual affairs, and daily <span id="page_122">p.
122</span> <span id="vi.VIII.VI-Page_122"></span>sighing unto Thee. I
resorted as frequently to Thy church as the business, under the burden
of which I groaned, left me free to do. Alypius was with me, being after
the third sitting disengaged from his legal occupation, and awaiting
further opportunity of selling his counsel, as I was wont to sell the
power of speaking, if it can be supplied by teaching. But Nebridius had,
on account of our friendship, consented to teach under Verecundus, a
citizen and a grammarian of Milan, and a very intimate friend of us all;
who vehemently desired, and by the right of friendship demanded from our
company, the faithful aid he greatly stood in need of. Nebridius, then,
was not drawn to this by any desire of gain (for he could have made much
more of his learning had he been so inclined), but, as a most sweet and
kindly friend, he would not be wanting in an office of friendliness, and
slight our request. But in this he acted very discreetly, taking care
not to become known to those personages whom the world esteems great;
thus avoiding distraction of mind, which he desired to have free and at
leisure as many hours as possible, to search, or read, or hear something
concerning wisdom.

<span id="vi.VIII.VI-p4"></span>14. Upon a certain day, then, Nebridius
being away (why, I do not remember), lo, there came to the house to see
Alypius and me, Pontitianus, a countryman of ours, in so far as he was
an African, who held high office in the emperor’s court. What he wanted
with us I know not, but we sat down to talk together, and it fell out
that upon a table before us, used for games, he noticed a book; he took
it up, opened it, and, contrary to his expectation, found it to be the
Apostle Paul,—for he imagined it to be one of those books which I was
wearing myself out in teaching. At this he looked up at me smilingly,
and expressed his delight and wonder that he had so unexpectedly found
this book, and this only, before my eyes. For he was both a Christian
and baptized, and often prostrated himself before Thee our God in the
church, in constant and daily prayers. When, then, I had told him that I
bestowed much pains upon these writings, a conversation ensued on his
speaking of Antony, <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) the Egyptian
monk, whose name was in high repute among Thy servants, though up to
that time not familiar to us. When he came to know this, he lingered on
that topic, imparting to us a knowledge of this man so eminent, and
marvelling at our ignorance. But we were amazed, hearing Thy wonderful
works most fully manifested in times so recent, and almost in our own,
wrought in the true faith and the Catholic Church. We all wondered—we,
that they were so great, and he, that we had never heard of them.

<span id="vi.VIII.VI-p6"></span>15. From this his conversation turned to
the companies in the monasteries, and their manners so fragrant unto
Thee, and of the fruitful deserts of the wilderness, of which we knew
nothing. And there was a monastery at Milan <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) full of good brethren, without the
walls of the city, under the fostering care of Ambrose, and we were
ignorant of it. He went on with his relation, and we listened intently
and in silence. He then related to us how on a certain afternoon, at
Triers, when the emperor was taken up with seeing the Circensian
games, <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) he and three others, his
comrades, went out for a walk in the gardens close to the city walls,
and there, as they chanced to walk two and two, one strolled away with
him, while the other two went by themselves; and these, in their
ram<span id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span
id="vi.VIII.VI-Page_123"></span>bling, came upon a certain cottage
inhabited by some of Thy servants, “poor in spirit,” of whom “is the
kingdom of heaven,” <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) where they
found a book in which was written the life of Antony. This one of them
began to read, marvel at, and be inflamed by it; and in the reading, to
meditate on embracing such a life, and giving up his worldly employments
to serve Thee. And these were of the body called “Agents for Public
Affairs.” <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) Then, suddenly being
overwhelmed with a holy love and a sober sense of shame, in anger with
himself, he cast his eyes upon his friend, exclaiming, “Tell me, I
entreat thee, what end we are striving for by all these labours of ours.
What is our aim? What is our motive in doing service? Can our hopes in
court rise higher than to be ministers of the emperor? And in such a
position, what is there not brittle, and fraught with danger, and by how
many dangers arrive we at greater danger? And when arrive we thither?
But if I desire to become a friend of God, behold, I am even now made
it.” Thus spake he, and in the pangs of the travail of the new life, he
turned his eyes again upon the page and continued reading, and was
inwardly changed where Thou sawest, and his mind was divested of the
world, as soon became evident; for as he read, and the surging of his
heart rolled along, he raged awhile, discerned and resolved on a better
course, and now, having become Thine, he said to his friend, “Now have I
broken loose from those hopes of ours, and am determined to serve God;
and this, from this hour, in this place, I enter upon. If thou art
reluctant to imitate me, hinder me not.” The other replied that he would
cleave to him, to share in so great a reward and so great a service.
Thus both of them, being now Thine, were building a tower at the
necessary cost, <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) —of forsaking
all that they had and following Thee. Then Pontitianus, and he that had
walked with him through other parts of the garden, came in search of
them to the same place, and having found them, reminded them to return
as the day had declined. But they, making known to him their resolution
and purpose, and how such a resolve had sprung up and become confirmed
in them, entreated them not to molest them, if they refused to join
themselves unto them. But the others, no whit changed from their former
selves, did yet (as he said) bewail themselves, and piously
congratulated them, recommending themselves to their prayers; and with
their hearts inclining towards earthly things, returned to the palace.
But the other two, setting their affections upon heavenly things,
remained in the cottage. And both of them had affianced brides, who,
when they heard of this, dedicated also their virginity unto God.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[122:653](1010136.htm#fr_652.md) <span
id="vi.VIII.VI-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.VIII.VI-p5"></span> It may be well here to say a few words
in regard to Monachism and Antony’s relation to it:—(1) There is much in
the later Platonism, with its austerities and bodily mortifications (see
vii. sec. 13, note 2, above), which is in common with the asceticism of
the early Church. The Therapeutæ of Philo, indeed, of whom there were
numbers in the neighbourhood of Alexandria in the first century, may be
considered as the natural forerunners of the Egyptian monks. (2)
Monachism, according to Sozomen (i. 12), had its origin in a desire to
escape persecution by retirement into the wilderness. It is probable,
however, that, as in the case of Paul the hermit of Thebais, the desire
for freedom from the cares of life, so that by contemplation and
mortification of the body, the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.VIII.VI-p5.1"></span>λόγος</span> or inner reason (which was held
to be an emanation of God) might be purified, had as much to do with the
hermit life as a fear of persecution. Mosheim, indeed (*Ecc. Hist.* i.
part 2, c. 3), supposes Paul to have been influenced entirely by these
Platonic notions. (3) Antony was born in the district of Thebes, <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.VIII.VI-p5.2"></span> A.D.</span> 251, and
visited Paul in the Egyptian desert a little before his death. To Antony
is the world indebted for establishing communities of monks, as
distinguished from the solitary asceticism of Paul; he therefore is
rightly viewed as the founder of Monachism. He appears to have known
little more than how to speak his native Coptic, yet during his long
life (said to have been 100 years) he by his fervent enthusiasm made for
himself a name little inferior to that of the “king of men,” Athanasius,
whom in the time of the Arian troubles he stedfastly supported, and by
whom his life has been handed down to us. Augustin, in his *De Doctr.
Christ.* (Prol. sec. 4), speaks of him as “a just and holy man, who, not
being able to read himself, is said to have committed the Scriptures to
memory through hearing them read by others, and by dint of wise
meditation to have arrived at a thorough understanding of them.” (4)
According to Sozomen (iii. 14), monasteries had not been established in
Europe <span class="c9"><span id="vi.VIII.VI-p5.3"></span> A.D.</span>
340. They were, Baronius tells us, introduced into Rome about that date
by Athanasius, during a visit to that city. Athanasius mentions
“ascetics” as dwelling at Rome <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.VIII.VI-p5.4"></span>A.D.</span> 355. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan,
Martin, Bishop of Tours, and Jerome were enthusiastic suppporters of the
system. (5) Monachism in Europe presented more of its practical and less
of its contemplative side, than in its cradle in the East. An example of
how the monks of the East did work for the good of others is seen in the
instance of the monks of Pachomius; still in this respect, as in matters
of doctrine, the West has generally shown itself more practical than the
East. Probably climate and the style of living consequent thereon have
much to do with this. Sulpicius Severus (dial. i. 2, *De Vita Martini*)
may be taken to give a quaint illustration of this, when he makes one of
his characters say, as he hears of the mode of living of the Eastern
monks, that their diet was only suited to angels. However mistaken we
may think the monkish systems to be, it cannot be concealed that in the
days of anarchy and semi-barbarism they were oftentimes centres of
civilisation. Certainly in its originating idea of meditative seclusion,
there is much that is worthy of commendation; for, as Farindon has it
(*Works*, iv. 130), “This has been the practice not only of holy men,
but of heathen men. Thus did Tully, and Antony, and Crassus make way to
that honour and renown which they afterwards purchased in eloquence
(Cicero, *De Officiis*, ii. 13, viii. 7); thus did they pass a
*solitudine in scholas, a scholis in forum*,—‘from their secret
retirement into the schools, and from the schools into the
pleading-place.’”

id="vi.VIII.VI-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.VIII.VI-p7"></span> Augustin, when comparing Christian with
Manichæan asceticism, says in his *De Mor. Eccl. Cath.* (sec. 70), “I
saw at Milan a lodging-house of saints, in number not a few, presided
over by one presbyter, a man of great excellence and learning.” In the
previous note we have given the generally received opinion, that the
first monastery in Europe was established at Rome. It may be mentioned
here that Muratori maintains that the institution was transplanted from
the East first to Milan; others contend that the first European society
was at Aquileia.

Roman commentators are ever ready to use this text of Scripture as an
argument in favour of monastic poverty, and some may feel disposed from
its context to imagine such an interpretation to be implied in this
place. This, however, can hardly be so. Augustin constantly points out
in his sermons, etc. in what the poverty that is pleasing to God
consists. “Pauper Dei,” he says (*in Ps.* cxxxi. 15), “in animo est, non
in sacculo;” and his interpretation of this passage in his *Exposition
of the Sermon on the Mount* (i. 3) is entirely opposed to the Roman
view. We there read: “The poor in spirit are rightly understood here as
meaning the humble and God-fearing, *i.e.* those who have not a spirit
which puffeth up. Nor ought blessedness to begin at any other point
whatever, if indeed it is to reach the highest wisdom. ‘The fear of the
Lord is the beginning of wisdom’ ([Ps.
111.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.VIII.VI-p9.2"></span>); whereas, on the other hand also, ‘pride’
is entitled ‘the beginning of all sin’ ([Ecclus.
10.13](../../../bib/apo/sir010.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.VIII.VI-p9.3"></span>). Let the proud, therefore, seek after and
love the kingdoms of the earth, but ‘blessed are the poor in spirit, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven.’”

<span id="fn_656"></span>[123:657](1010136.htm#fr_656.md) <span
id="vi.VIII.VI-p9.4"></span>

<span id="vi.VIII.VI-p10"></span> “*Agentes in rebus*. There was a
society of them still about the court. Their militia or employments were
to gather in the emperor’s tributes; to fetch in offenders; to do
*Palatini obsequia*, offices of court provide corn, etc., ride on
errands like messengers of the chamber, lie abroad as spies and
intelligencers. They were often preferred to places of magistracy in the
provinces; such were called *Principes* or *Magistriani*. St. Hierome
upon Abdias, c. 1, calls them messengers. They succeeded the
*Frumentarii*, between which two and the *Curiosi* and the
*Speculatores* there was not much difference.”—W. W.
