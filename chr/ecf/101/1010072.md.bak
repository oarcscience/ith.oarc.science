Beauty Enticing Us.</span>

<span id="vi.IV.XIII-p2"></span>20. These things I knew not at that
time, and I loved these lower beauties, and I was sinking to the very
depths; and I said to my friends, “Do we love anything but the
beautiful? What, then, is the beautiful? And what is beauty? What is it
that allures and unites us to the things we love; for unless there were
a grace and beauty in them, they could by no means attract us to them?”
And I marked and perceived that in bodies themselves there was a beauty
from their forming a kind of whole, and another from mutual fitness, as
one part of the body with its whole, or a shoe with a foot, and so on.
And this consideration sprang up in my mind out of the recesses of my
heart, and I wrote books (two or three, I think) “on the fair and fit.”
Thou knowest, O Lord, for it has escaped me; for I have them not, but
they have strayed from me, I know not how.
