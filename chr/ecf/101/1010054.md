<span id="vi.III.VIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.III.VIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—He Argues Against the Same as
to the Reason of Offences.</span>

<span id="vi.III.VIII-p2"></span>15. Can it at any time or place be an
unrighteous thing for a man to love God with all his heart, with all his
soul, and with all his mind, and his neighbour as himself? <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) Therefore those offences which be
contrary to nature are everywhere and at all times to be held in
detestation and punished; such were those of the Sodomites, which should
all nations commit, they should all be held guilty of the same crime by
the divine law, which hath not so made men that they should in that way
abuse one another. For even that fellowship which should be between God
and us is violated, when that same nature of which He is author is
polluted by the perversity of lust. But those offences which are
contrary to the customs of men are to be avoided according to the
customs severally prevailing; so that an agreement made, and confirmed
by custom or law of any city or nation, may not be violated at the
lawless pleasure of any, whether citizen or stranger. For any part which
is not consistent with its whole is unseemly. But when God commands
anything contrary to the customs or compacts of any nation to be done,
though it were never done by them before, it is to be done; and if
intermitted it is to be restored, and, if never established, to be
established. For if it be lawful for a king, in the state over which he
reigns, to command that which neither he himself nor any one before him
had commanded, and to obey him cannot be held to be inimical to the
public interest,—nay, it were so if he were not obeyed (for obedience to
princes is a general compact of human society),—how much more, then,
ought we unhesitatingly to obey God, the Governor of all His creatures!
For as among the authorities of human society the greater authority is
obeyed before the lesser, so must God above all.

<span id="vi.III.VIII-p4"></span>16. So also in deeds of violence, where
there is a desire to harm, whether by contumely or injury; and both of
these either by reason of revenge, as one enemy against another; or to
obtain some advantage over another, as the highwayman to the traveller;
or for the avoiding of some evil, as with him who is in fear of another;
or through envy, as the unfortunate man to one who is happy; or as he
that is prosperous in anything to him who he fears will become equal to
himself, or whose equality he grieves at; or for the mere pleasure in
another’s pains, as the spectators of gladiators, or the deriders and
mockers of others. These be the chief iniquities which spring forth from
the lust of the flesh, of the eye, and of power, whether singly, or two
together, or all at once. And so do men live in opposition to the three
and seven, that psaltery “of ten strings,” <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) Thy ten commandments, O God most high
and most sweet. But what foul offences can there be against Thee who
canst not be defiled? Or what deeds of violence against thee who canst
not be harmed? But Thou avengest that which men perpetrate against
themselves, seeing also that when they sin against Thee, they do
wickedly against their own souls; and iniquity gives itself the
lie, <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) either by corrupting or
perverting their nature, which Thou hast made and ordained, or by an
immoderate use of things permitted, or in “burning” in things forbidden
to that use which is against nature; <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) or when convicted, raging with heart
and voice against Thee, kicking against the pricks; <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) or when, breaking through the pale of
human society, they audaciously rejoice in private combinations or
divisions, according as they have been pleased or offended. And these
things are done whenever Thou art forsaken, O Fountain of Life, who art
the only and true Creator and Ruler of the universe, and by a
self-willed pride any one false thing is selected therefrom and loved.
So, then, by a humble piety we return to Thee; and thou purgest us from
our evil customs, and art merciful unto the sins of those who confess
unto Thee, and dost “hear the groaning of the prisoner,” <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) and dost loosen us from those fetters
which we have forged for ourselves, if we lift not up against Thee the
horns of a false liberty,—<span id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span
id="vi.III.VIII-Page_66"></span>losing all through craving more, by
loving more our own private good than Thee, the good of all.

71) mentions the two modes of dividing the ten commandments into three
and seven, or four and six, and gives what appear to have been his own
private reasons for preferring the first. Both commonly existed in his
day, but the Anglican mode appears to have been the most usual. It
occurs in Origen, Greg. Naz., Jerome, Ambrose, Chrys. St. Augustin
alludes to his division again, *Serm*. 8, 9, *de* x.*Chordis*, and sec.
33 on this psalm: ‘To the first commandment there belong three strings
because God is trine. To the other, *i.e.*, the love of our neighbour,
seven strings. These let us join to those three, which belong to the
love of God, if we would on the psaltery of ten strings sing a new
song.’”—E.B.P.
