<span id="vii.1.LXIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.)

<span id="vii.1.LXIII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXIII-p3.1"></span>To Severus, My lord Most Blessed and
Venerable, a Brother Worthy of Being Embraced with Unfeigned Love, and
Partner in the Priestly Office, and to the Brethren that are With Him,
Augustin and the Brethren with Him Send Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXIII-p4"></span>1. If I frankly say all that this case
compels me to say, you may perhaps ask me where is my concern for the
preservation of charity but if <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="vii.1.LXIII-Page_320"></span>I may not thus say all that the case
demands, may I not ask you where is the liberty conceded to friendship?
Hesitating between these two alternatives, I have chosen to write so
much as may justify me without accusing you. You wrote that you were
surprised that we, notwithstanding our great grief at what was done,
acquiesced in it, when it might have been remedied by our correction; as
if when things wrongly done have been afterwards, so far as possible,
corrected, they are no longer to be deplored; and more particularly, as
if it were absurd for us to acquiesce in that which, though wrongly
done, it is impossible for us to undo. Wherefore, my brother, sincerely
esteemed as such, your surprise may cease. For Timotheus was ordained a
subdeacon at Subsana against my advice and desire, at the time when the
decision of his case was still pending as the subject of deliberation
and conference between us. Behold me still grieving over this, although
he has now returned to you; and we do not regret that in our consenting
to his return we obeyed your will.

<span id="vii.1.LXIII-p5"></span>2. May it please you to hear how, by
rebuke, admonition, and prayer, we had, even before he went away from
this place, corrected the wrong which had been done, lest it should
appear to you that up to that time nothing had been corrected by us
because he had not returned to you. By *rebuke*, addressing ourselves
first to Timotheus himself, because he did not obey you, but went away
to your Holiness without consulting our brother Carcedonius, to which
act of his the origin of this affliction is to be traced; and afterwards
censuring the presbyter (Carcedonius) and Verinus, through whom we found
that the ordination of Timotheus had been managed. When all of these
admitted, under our rebuke, that in all the things alleged they had done
wrong and begged forgiveness, we would have acted with undue haughtiness
if we had refused to believe that they were sufficiently corrected. For
they could not make that to be not done which had been done; and we by
our rebuke were not expecting or desiring to do more than bring them to
acknowledge their faults, and grieve over them. By *admonition*: first,
in warning all never to dare again to do such things, lest they should
incur God’s wrath; and then especially charging Timotheus, who said that
he was bound only by his oath to go to your Grace, that if your
Holiness, considering all that we had spoken together on the matter,
should, as we hoped might be the case, decide not to have him with you,
out of regard for the weak for whom Christ died, who might be offended,
and for the discipline of the Church, which it is perilous to disregard,
seeing that he had begun to be a reader in this diocese,—he should then,
being free from the bond of his oath, devote himself with undisturbed
mind to the service of God, to whom we are to give an account of all our
actions. By such admonitions as we were able to give, we had also
persuaded our brother Carcedonius to submit with perfect resignation to
whatever might be seen to be necessary in regard to him for the
preservation of the discipline of the Church. By *prayer*, moreover, we
had laboured to correct ourselves, commending both the guidance and the
issues of our counsels to the mercy of God, and seeking that if any
sinful anger had wounded us, we might be cured by taking refuge under
His healing right hand. Behold how much we had corrected by rebuke,
admonition, and prayer!

<span id="vii.1.LXIII-p6"></span>3. And now, considering the bond of
charity, that we may not be possessed by Satan,—for we are not ignorant
of his devices,—what else ought we to have done than obey your wish,
seeing that you thought that what had been done could be remedied in no
other way than by our giving back to your authority him in whose person
you complained that wrong had been done to you. Even our brother
Carcedonius himself consented to this, not indeed without much distress
of spirit, on account of which I entreat you to pray for him, but
eventually without opposition, believing that he submitted to Christ in
submitting to you. Nay, even when I still thought it might be our duty
to consider whether I should not write a second letter to you, my
brother, while Timotheus still remained here, he himself, with filial
reverence, feared to displease you, and cut my deliberations short by
not only consenting, but even urging, that Timotheus should be restored
to you.

<span id="vii.1.LXIII-p7"></span>4. I therefore, brother Severus, leave
my case to be decided by you. For I am sure that Christ dwells in your
heart, and by Him I beseech you to ask counsel from Him, submitting your
mind to His direction regarding the question whether, when a man had
begun to be a Reader in the Church confided to my care, having read, not
once only, but a second and a third time, at Subsana, and in company
with the presbyter of the Church of Subsana had done the same also at
Turres and Ciza and Verbalis, it is either possible or right that he be
pronounced to have never been a Reader. And as we have, in obedience to
God, corrected that which was afterwards done contrary to our will, do
you also, in obedience to Him, correct in like manner that which was
formerly, through your not knowing the facts of the case, wrongly done.
For I have no fear of your failing to perceive what a door is opened for
breaking down the discipline of the Church, if, when a clergyman of any
church has sworn to one of another church that he will not leave him,
that other encourage him to remain with him, alleging that he does so
that he <span id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span
id="vii.1.LXIII-Page_321"></span>may not be the occasion of the breaking
of an oath; seeing that he who forbids this, and declines to allow the
other to remain with him (because that other could by his vow bind only
his own conscience), unquestionably preserves the order which is
necessary to peace in a way which none can justly censure.
