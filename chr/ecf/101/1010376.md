<span id="vii.1.LXX-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.1.LXX-p3"></span>This letter is addressed by Alypius and
Augustin to Naucelio, a person through whom they had discussed the
question of the Donatist schism with Clarentius, an aged Donatist bishop
(probably the same with the Numidian bishop of Tabraca, who took part in
the Conference at Carthage in 411 <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXX-p3.1"></span> a.d.</span>). The ground traversed in the
letter is the same as in pages 296 and 297, in Letter LI., regarding the
inconsistencies of the Donatists in the case of Felicianus of Musti. We
therefore leave it untranslated.
