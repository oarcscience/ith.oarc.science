id="vi.XII.VI-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—He Confesses that at One Time He
Himself Thought Erroneously of Matter.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.VI-p2"></span>6. But were I, O Lord, by my mouth and by
my pen to confess unto Thee the whole, whatever Thou hast taught me
concerning that matter, the name of which hearing beforehand, and not
understanding (they who could not understand it telling me of it), I
conceived <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) it as having
innumerable and varied forms. And therefore did I not conceive it; my
mind revolved in disturbed order foul and horrible “forms,” but yet
“forms;” and I called it formless, not that it lacked form, but because
it had such as, did it appear, my mind would turn from, as unwonted and
incongruous, and at which human weakness would be disturbed. But even
that which I did conceive was formless, not by the privation of all
form, but in comparison of more beautiful forms; and true reason
persuaded me that I ought altogether to remove from it all remnants of
any form whatever, if I wished to conceive matter wholly without form;
and I could not. For sooner could I imagine that that which should be
deprived of all form was not at all, than conceive anything between form
and nothing,—neither formed, nor nothing, formless, nearly nothing. And
my mind hence ceased to question my spirit, filled (as it was) with the
images of formed bodies, and changing and varying them according to its
will; and I applied myself to the bodies themselves, and looked more
deeply into their mutability, by which they cease to be what they had
been, and begin to be what they were not; and this same transit from
form unto form I have looked upon to be through some formless condition,
not through a very nothing; but I desired to know, not to guess. And if
my voice and my pen should confess the whole unto Thee, whatsoever knots
Thou hast untied for me concerning this question, who of my readers
would endure to take in the whole? Nor yet, therefore, shall my heart
cease to give Thee honour, and a song of praise, for those things which
it is not able to express. For the mutability of mutable things is
itself capable of all those forms into which mutable things are changed.
And this mutability, what is it? Is it soul? Is it body? Is it the outer
appearance of soul or body? Could it be said, “Nothing were something,”
and “That which is, is not,” I would say that this were it; and yet in
some manner was it already, since it could receive these visible and
compound shapes.
