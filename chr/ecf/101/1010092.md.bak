<span id="vi.VI.I-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.VI.I-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.—His Mother Having Followed Him to
Milan, Declares that She Will Not Die Before Her Son Shall Have Embraced
the Catholic Faith.</span>

<span id="vi.VI.I-p2"></span>1. <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.VI.I-p2.1"></span>O Thou</span>, my hope from my youth, <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) where wert Thou to me, and whither
hadst Thou gone? For in truth, hadst Thou not created me, and made a
difference between me and the beasts of the field and fowls of the air?
Thou hadst made me wiser than they, yet did I wander about in dark and
slippery places, and sought Thee abroad out of myself, and found not the
God of my heart; <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) and had entered
the depths of the sea, and distrusted and despaired finding out the
truth. By this time my mother, made strong by her piety, had come to me,
following me over sea and land, in all perils feeling secure in Thee.
For in the dangers of the sea she comforted the very sailors (to whom
the inexperienced passengers, when alarmed, were wont rather to go for
comfort), assuring them of a safe arrival, because she had been so
assured by Thee in a vision. She found me in grievous danger, through
despair of ever finding truth. But when I had disclosed to her that I
was now no longer a Manichæan, though not yet a Catholic Christian, she
did not leap for joy as at what was unexpected; although she was now
reassured as to that part of my misery for which she had mourned me as
one dead, but who would be raised to Thee, carrying me forth upon the
bier of her thoughts, that Thou mightest say unto the widow’s son,
“Young man, I say unto Thee, arise,” and he should revive, and begin to
speak, and Thou shouldest deliver him to his mother. <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) Her heart, then, was not agitated with
any violent exultation, when she had heard that to be already in so
great a part accomplished which she daily, with tears, entreated of Thee
might be done,—that though I had not yet grasped the truth, I was
rescued from falsehood. Yea, rather, for that she was fully confident
that Thou, who hadst promised the whole, wouldst give the rest, most
calmly, and with a breast full of confidence, she replied to me, “She
believed in Christ, that before she departed this life, she would see me
a Catholic believer.” <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) And thus
much said she to me; but to Thee, O Fountain of mercies, poured she out
more frequent prayers and tears, that Thou wouldest hasten Thy aid, and
enlighten my darkness; and she hurried all the more assiduously to the
church, and hung upon the words of Ambrose, praying for the fountain of
water that springeth up into everlasting life. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) For she loved that man as an angel of
God, because she knew that it was by him that I had been brought, for
the present, to that perplexing state of agitation <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) I was now in, through which she was
fully persuaded that I should pass from <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>
<span id="vi.VI.I-Page_90"></span>sickness unto health, after an excess,
as it were, of a sharper fit, which doctors term the “crisis.”

<span id="vi.VI.I-p6"></span> *Fidelem Catholicum*—those who are
baptized being usually designated *Fideles*. The following extract from
Kaye’s *Tertullian* (pp. 230, 231) is worthy of note:—“As the converts
from heathenism, to use Tertullian’s expression, were not born, but
became Christians \[*fiunt, nascuntur, Christiani*\], they went through
a course of instruction in the principles and doctrines of the gospel,
and were subjected to a strict probation before they were admitted to
the rite of baptism. In this stage of their progress they were called
catechumens, of whom, according to Suicer, there were two classes,—one
called ‘Audientes,’ who had only entered upon their course, and begun to
hear the word of God; the other, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.VI.I-p6.1"></span>συναιτοῦντες,</span> or ‘Competentes,’ who had
made such advances in Christian knowledge and practice as to be
qualified to appear at the font. Tertullian, however, appears either not
to have known or to have neglected this distinction, since he applies
the names of ‘Audientes’ and ‘Auditores’ indifferently to all who had
not partaken of the rite of baptism. When the catechumens had given full
proof of the ripeness of their knowledge, and of the stedfastness of
their faith, they were baptized, admitted to the table of the Lord, and
styled *Fideles*. The importance which Tertullian attached to this
previous probation of the candidates for baptism, appears from the fact
that he founds upon the neglect of it one of his charges against the
heretics. ‘Among them,’ he says, ‘no distinction is made between the
catechumen and the faithful or confirmed Christian; the catechumen is
pronounced fit for baptism before he is instructed; all come in
indiscriminately; all hear, all pray together.’” There were certain
peculiar forms used in the admission of catechumens; as, for example,
anointing with oil, imposition of hands, and the consecration and giving
of salt; and when, from the progress of Christianity, Tertullian’s above
description as to converts from heathenism had ceased to be correct,
these forms were continued in many churches as part of the baptismal
service, whether of infants or adults. See Palmer’s *Origines
Liturgicæ*, v. 1, and also i. sec. 17, above, where Augustin says: “I
was signed with the sign of the cross, and was seasoned with His salt,
even from the womb of my mother.”

<span id="vi.VI.I-p8"></span> “Sermons,” says Goodwin in his
*Evangelical Communicant*, “are, for the most part, as showers of rain
that water for the instant; such as may tickle the ear and warm the
affections, and put the soul into a posture of obedience. Hence it is
that men are oft-times sermon-sick, as some are sea-sick; very ill, much
troubled for the present, but by and by all is well again as they were.”
