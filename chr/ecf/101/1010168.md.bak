id="vi.X.XI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—What It is to Learn and to
Think.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XI-p2"></span>18. Wherefore we find that to learn these
things, whose images we drink not in by our senses, but perceive within
as they are by themselves, without images, is nothing else but by
meditation as it were to concentrate, and by observing to take care that
those notions which the memory did before contain scattered and
confused, be laid up at hand, as it were, in that same memory, where
before they lay concealed, scattered and neglected, and so the more
easily present themselves to the mind well accustomed to observe them.
And how many things of this sort does my memory retain which have been
found out already, and, as I said, are, as it were, laid up ready to
hand, which we are said to have learned and to have known; which, should
we for small intervals of time cease to recall, they are again so
submerged and slide back, as it were, into the more remote chambers,
that they must be evolved thence again as if new (for other sphere they
have none), and must be marshalled \[*cogenda*\] again that they may
become known; that is to say, they must be collected \[*colligenda*\],
as it were, from their dispersion; whence we have the word *cogitare*.
For *cogo* \[*I collect*\] and *cogito* \[*I recollect*\] have the same
relation to each other as *ago* and *agito*, *facio* and *factito*. But
the mind has appropriated to itself this word \[cogitation\], so that
not that which is collected anywhere, but what is collected, <span
id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) that is marshalled, <span
id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md) in the mind, is properly said to be
“cogitated.” <span id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md)
