<span id="vi.III.XI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.III.XI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—He Refers to the Tears, and the
Memorable Dream Concerning Her Son, Granted by God to His Mother.</span>

<span id="vi.III.XI-p2"></span>19. And Thou sendedst Thine hand from
above, <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) and drewest my soul out
of that profound darkness, when my mother, Thy faithful one, wept to
thee on my behalf more than mothers are wont to weep the bodily death of
their children. For she saw that I was dead by that faith and spirit
which she had from Thee, and Thou heardest her, O Lord. Thou heardest
her, and despisedst not her tears, when, pouring down, they watered the
earth <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) under her eyes in every
place where she prayed; yea, Thou heardest her. For whence was that
dream with which Thou consoledst her, so that she permitted me to live
with her, and to have my meals at the same table in the house, which she
had begun to avoid, hating and detesting the blasphemies of my error?
For she saw herself standing on a certain wooden rule, <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) and a bright youth advancing towards
her, joyous and smiling <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="vi.III.XI-Page_67"></span>upon her, whilst she was grieving and
bowed down with sorrow. But he having inquired of her the cause of her
sorrow and daily weeping (he wishing to teach, as is their wont, and not
to be taught), and she answering that it was my perdition she was
lamenting, he bade her rest contented, and told her to behold and see
“that where she was, there was I also.” And when she looked she saw me
standing near her on the same rule. Whence was this, unless that Thine
ears were inclined towards her heart? O Thou Good Omnipotent, who so
carest for every one of us as if Thou caredst for him only, and so for
all as if they were but one!

<span id="vi.III.XI-p6"></span>20. Whence was this, also, that when she
had narrated this vision to me, and I tried to put this construction on
it, “That she rather should not despair of being some day what I was,”
she immediately, without hesitation, replied, “No; for it was not told
me that ‘where he is, there shalt thou be,’ but ‘where thou art, there
shall he be’”? I confess to Thee, O Lord, that, to the best of my
remembrance (and I have oft spoken of this), Thy answer through my
watchful mother—that she was not disquieted by the speciousness of my
false interpretation, and saw in a moment what was to be seen, and which
I myself had not in truth perceived before she spoke—even then moved me
more than the dream itself, by which the happiness to that pious woman,
to be realized so long after, was, for the alleviation of her present
anxiety, so long before predicted. For nearly nine years passed in which
I wallowed in the slime of that deep pit and the darkness of falsehood,
striving often to rise, but being all the more heavily dashed down. But
yet that chaste, pious, and sober widow (such as Thou lovest), now more
buoyed up with hope, though no whit less zealous in her weeping and
mourning, desisted not, at all the hours of her supplications, to bewail
my case unto Thee. And her prayers entered into Thy presence, <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) and yet Thou didst still suffer me to
be involved and re-involved in that darkness.
