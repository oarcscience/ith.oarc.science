<span id="vi.XIII.XXVI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XIII.XXVI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—In the Confessing of
Benefits, Computation is Made Not as to The “Gift,” But as to the
“Fruit,”—That Is, the Good and Right Will of the Giver.</span>

<span id="vi.XIII.XXVI-p2"></span>39. But they who are delighted with
them are fed by those fruits; nor are they delighted with them “whose
god is their belly.” <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) For
neither in those that yield them are the things given the fruit, but in
what spirit they give them. Therefore he who serves God and not his own
belly, <span id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) I plainly see why he
may rejoice; I see it, and I rejoice with him exceedingly. For he hath
received from the Philippians those things which they had sent from
Epaphroditus; <span id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md) but yet I see
why he rejoiced. For whereat he rejoices, upon that he feeds; for
speaking in truth, “I rejoiced,” saith he, “in the Lord greatly, that
now at the last your care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were
also careful,” <span id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) but it had
become wearisome unto you. These Philippians, then, by protracted
wearisomeness, had become enfeebled, and as it were dried up, as to
bringing forth this fruit of a good work; and he rejoiceth for them,
because they flourished again, not for himself, because they ministered
to his wants. Therefore, adds he, “not that I speak in respect of want,
for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. I
know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound everywhere and in
all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to
abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which
strengtheneth me.” <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md)

<span id="vi.XIII.XXVI-p8"></span>40. Whereat, then, dost thou rejoice
in all things, O great Paul? Whereat dost thou rejoice? Whereon dost
thou feed, O man, re<span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="vi.XIII.XXVI-Page_204"></span>newed in the knowledge of God, after
the image of Him that created thee, thou living soul of so great
continency, and thou tongue like flying fowls, speaking mysteries,—for
to such creatures is this food due,—what is that which feeds thee? Joy.
Let us hear what follows. “Notwithstanding,” saith he, “ye have well
done that ye did communicate with My affliction.” <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) Hereat doth he rejoice, hereon doth
he feed; because they have well done, <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) not because his strait was
relieved, who saith unto thee, “Thou hast enlarged me when I was in
distress;” <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) because he knew
both “to abound and to suffer need,” <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md) in Thee Who strengthenest him. For,
saith he, “ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel,
when I departed from Macedonia, no Church communicated with me as
concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. For even in Thessalonica
ye sent once and again unto my necessity.” <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md) Unto these good works he now
rejoiceth that they have returned; and is made glad that they flourished
again, as when a fruitful field recovers its greenness.

<span id="vi.XIII.XXVI-p14"></span>41. Was it on account of his own
necessities that he said, “Ye have sent unto my necessity? Rejoiceth he
for that? Verily not for that. But whence know we this? Because he
himself continues, “Not because I desire a gift, but I desire
fruit.” <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) From Thee, O my God,
have I learned to distinguish between a “gift” and “fruit.” A gift is
the thing itself which he gives who bestows these necessaries, as money,
food, drink, clothing, shelter, aid; but the fruit is the good and right
will of the giver. For the good Master saith not only, “He that
receiveth a prophet,” but addeth, “in the name of a prophet.” Nor saith
He only, “He that receiveth a righteous man,” but addeth, “in the name
of a righteous man.” So, verily, the former shall receive the reward of
a prophet, the latter that of a righteous man. Nor saith He only,
“Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of
cold water,” but addeth, “in the name of a disciple” and so concludeth,
“Verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.” <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) The gift is to receive a prophet,
to receive a righteous man, to hand a cup of cold water to a disciple;
but the fruit is to do this in the name of a prophet, in the name of a
righteous man, in the name of a disciple. With fruit was Elijah fed by
the widow, who knew that she fed a man of God, and on this account fed
him; but by the raven was he fed with a gift. Nor was the inner
man <span id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414.md) of Elijah fed, but the
outer only, which might also from want of such food have perished.
