<span id="vi.IX.III-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.IX.III-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—He Retires to the Villa of His
Friend Verecundus, Who Was Not Yet a Christian, and Refers to His
Conversion and Death, as Well as that of Nebridius.</span>

<span id="vi.IX.III-p2"></span>5. Verecundus was wasted with anxiety at
that our happiness, since he, being most firmly held by his bonds, saw
that he would lose our fellowship. For he was not yet a Christian,
though his wife was one of the faithful; <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701) and yet hereby, being more firmly
enchained than by anything else, was he held back from that journey
which we had commenced. Nor, he declared, did he wish to be a Christian
on any other terms than those that were impossible. However, he invited
us most courteously to make use of his country house so long as we
should stay there. Thou, O Lord, wilt “recompense” him for this “at the
resurrection of the just,” <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702)
seeing that Thou hast already given him “the lot of the
righteous.” <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703) For although, when
we were absent at Rome, he, being overtaken with bodily sickness, and
therein being made a Christian, and one of the faithful, departed this
life, yet hadst Thou mercy on him, and not on him only, but on us
also; <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704) lest, thinking on the
exceeding kindness of our friend to us, and unable to count him in Thy
flock, we should be tortured with intolerable grief. Thanks be unto
Thee, our God, we are Thine. Thy exhortations, consolations, and
faithful promises assure us that Thou now repayest Verecundus for that
country house at Cassiacum, where from the fever of the world we found
rest in Thee, with the perpetual freshness of Thy Paradise, in that Thou
hast forgiven him his earthly sins, in that mountain flowing with
milk, <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705) that fruitful
mountain,—Thine own.

<span id="vi.IX.III-p8"></span>6. He then was at that time full of
grief; but Nebridius was joyous. Although he also, not being yet a
Christian, had fallen into the pit of that most pernicious error of
believing Thy Son to be a phantasm, <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706) yet, coming out thence, he <span
id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span id="vi.IX.III-Page_131"></span>held
the same belief that we did; not as yet initiated in any of the
sacraments of Thy Church, but a most earnest inquirer after truth. <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) Whom, not long after our conversion
and regeneration by Thy baptism, he being also a faithful member of the
Catholic Church, and serving Thee in perfect chastity and continency
amongst his own people in Africa, when his whole household had been
brought to Christianity through him, didst Thou release from the flesh;
and now he lives in Abraham’s bosom. Whatever that may be which is
signified by that bosom, <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708) there
lives my Nebridius, my sweet friend, Thy son, O Lord, adopted of a
freedman; there he liveth. For what other place could there be for such
a soul? There liveth he, concerning which he used to ask me much,—me, an
inexperienced, feeble one. Now he puts not his ear unto my mouth, but
his spiritual mouth unto Thy fountain, and drinketh as much as he is
able, wisdom according to his desire,—happy without end. Nor do I
believe that he is so inebriated with it as to forget me, <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709) seeing Thou, O Lord, whom he drinketh,
art mindful of us. Thus, then, were we comforting the sorrowing
Verecundus (our friendship being untouched) concerning our conversion,
and exhorting him to a faith according to his condition, I mean, his
married state. And tarrying for Nebridius to follow us, which being so
near, he was just about to do, when, behold, those days passed over at
last; for long and many they seemed, on account of my love of easeful
liberty, that I might sing unto Thee from my very marrow. My heart said
unto Thee,—I have sought Thy face; “Thy face, Lord, will I seek.” <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710)

<span id="vi.IX.III-p7"></span> Literally, *In monte incaseato*, “the
mountain of curds,” from the *Old Ver.* of [Ps. lxviii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016)<span id="vi.IX.III-p7.1"></span>.
The *Vulgate* renders *coagulatus*. But the Authorized Version is nearer
the true meaning, when it renders <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="vi.IX.III-p7.2"></span>גַּבְנֻנִים</span>, *hunched*, as “high.” The
LXX. renders it <span class="EL"><span
id="vi.IX.III-p7.3"></span>τετυρωμένος</span>, *condensed*, as if from
<span class="Hebrew"><span id="vi.IX.III-p7.4"></span> גְּבִינָה</span>,
*cheese*. This divergence arises from the unused root <span
class="Hebrew"><span id="vi.IX.III-p7.5"></span>גָּבַן</span>, *to be
curved*, having derivatives meaning (1) “hunch-backed,” when applied to
the body, and (2) “cheese” or “curds,” when applied to milk. Augustin,
in his exposition of this place, makes the “mountain” to be Christ, and
parallels it with [Isa. 2.2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)<span
id="vi.IX.III-p7.6"></span>; and the “milk” he interprets of the grace
that comes from Him for Christ’s little ones: *Ipse est mons incaseatus,
propter parvulos gratia tanquam lacte nutriendos*.

<span id="vi.IX.III-p11"></span> Though Augustin, in his *Quæst. Evang.*
ii. qu. 38, makes Abraham’s bosom to represent the rest into which the
Gentiles entered after the Jews had put it from them, yet he, for the
most part, in common with the early Church (see *Serm.* xiv. 3; *Con.
Faust.* xxxiii. 5; and *Eps.* clxiv. 7, and clxxxvii. Compare also
Tertullian, *De Anima*, lviii), takes it to mean the resting-place of
the souls of the righteous after death. Abraham’s bosom, indeed, is the
same as the “Paradise” of [Luke
23.43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043)<span
id="vi.IX.III-p11.1"></span>. The souls of the faithful after they are
delivered from the flesh are in “joy and felicity” (*De Civ. Dei*, i.
13, and xiii. 19); but they will not have “their perfect consummation
and bliss both in *body and soul*” until the morning of the
resurrection, when they shall be endowed with “spiritual *bodies.*” See
note p. 111; and for the difference between the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.IX.III-p11.2"></span>ᾳδης</span> of [Luke
16.23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023)<span
id="vi.IX.III-p11.3"></span>, that is, the place of departed
spirits,—into which it is said in the Apostles’ Creed Christ
descended,—and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.IX.III-p11.4"></span>γέεννα</span>, or Hell, see Campbell on *The
Gospels*, i. 253. In the A.V. both Greek words are rendered “Hell.”
