What God Did Before He Created Heaven and Earth.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.X-p2"></span>12. Lo, are they not full of their ancient
way, who say to us, “What was God doing before He made heaven and earth?
For if,” say they, “He were unoccupied, and did nothing, why does He not
for ever also, and from henceforth, cease from working, as in times past
He did? For if any new motion has arisen in God, and a new will, to form
a creature which He had never before formed, however can that be a true
eternity where there ariseth a will which was not before? For the will
of God is not a creature, but before the creature; because nothing could
be created unless the will of the Creator were before it. The will of
God, therefore, pertaineth to His very Substance. But if anything hath
arisen in the Substance of God which was not before, that Substance is
not truly called eternal. But if it was the eternal will of God that the
creature should be, why was not the creature also from eternity?”
