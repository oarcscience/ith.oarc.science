id="vi.X.XXXIII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—He Overcame the Pleasures
of the Ear, Although in the Church He Frequently Delighted in the Song,
Not in the Thing Sung.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXXIII-p2"></span>49. The delights of the ear had more
powerfully inveigled and conquered me, but Thou didst unbind and
liberate me. Now, in those airs which Thy words breathe soul into, when
sung with a sweet and trained voice, do I somewhat repose; yet not so as
to cling to them, but so as to free myself when I wish. But with the
words which are their life do they, that they may gain admission into
me, strive after a place of some honour in my heart; and I can hardly
assign them a fitting one. Sometimes I appear to myself to give them
more respect than, is fitting, as I perceive that our minds are more
devoutly and earnestly elevated into a flame of piety by the holy words
themselves when they are thus sung, than when they are not; and that all
affections of our spirit, by their own diversity, have their appropriate
measures in the voice and singing, wherewith by I know not what secret
relationship they are stimulated. But the gratification of my flesh, to
which the mind ought never to be given over to be enervated, often
beguiles me, while the sense does not so attend on reason as to follow
her patiently; but having gained admission merely for her sake, it
strives even to run on before her, and be her leader. Thus in these
things do I sin unknowing, but afterwards do I know it.

<span id="vi.X.XXXIII-p3"></span>50. Sometimes, again, avoiding very
earnestly this same deception, I err out of too great preciseness; and
sometimes so much as to desire that every air of the pleasant songs to
which David’s Psalter is often used, be banished both from my ears and
those of the Church itself; and that way seemed unto me safer which I
remembered to have been often related to me of Athanasius, Bishop of
Alexandria, who obliged the reader of the psalm to give utterance to it
with so slight an inflection of voice, that it was more like speaking
than singing. Notwithstanding, when I call to mind the tears I shed at
the songs of Thy Church, at the outset of my recovered faith, and how
even now I am moved not by the singing but by what is sung, when they
are sung with a clear and skilfully modulated voice, I then acknowledge
the great utility of this custom. Thus vacillate I between dangerous
pleasure and tried soundness; being inclined rather (though I pronounce
no irrevocable opinion upon the subject) to approve of the use of
singing in the church, that so by the delights of the ear the weaker
minds may be stimulated to a devotional frame. Yet when it happens to me
to be more moved by the singing than by what is sung, I confess myself
to have sinned criminally, and then I would rather not have heard the
singing. See now the condition I am in! Weep with me, and weep for me,
you who so control your inward feelings as that good results ensue. As
for you who do not thus act, these things concern you not. But Thou, O
Lord my God, give ear, behold and see, and have mercy upon me, and heal
me, <span id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) —Thou, in whose sight I am
become a puzzle to myself; and “this is my infirmity.” <span
