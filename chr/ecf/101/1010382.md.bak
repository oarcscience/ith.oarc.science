<span id="vii.1.LXXVI"></span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXVI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.LXXVI-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXVI.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXVI-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXVI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 402.)

<span id="vii.1.LXXVI-p3"></span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXVI-p4"></span>1. Hear, O Donatists, what the Catholic
Church says to you: “O ye sons of men, how long will ye be slow of
heart? why will ye love vanity, and follow after lies?” <span
id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md) Why have you severed yourselves, by
the heinous impiety of schism, from the unity of the whole world? You
give heed to the falsehoods concerning the surrendering of the divine
books to persecutors, which men who are either deceiving you, or are
themselves deceived, utter in order that you may die in a state of
heretical separation: and you do not give heed to what these divine
books themselves proclaim, in order that you may live in the peace of
the Catholic Church. Wherefore do you lend an open ear to the words of
men who tell you things which they have never been able to prove, and
are deaf to the voice of God speaking thus: “The Lord hath said unto me,
Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall
give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
the earth for Thy possession”? <span
id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md) “To Abraham and his seed were the
promises made. He saith not, ‘And to seeds,’ as of many, but as of one,
‘And to thy seed,’ which is Christ.” <span
id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md) And the promise to which the
apostle refers is this: “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
be blessed.” <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956.md) Therefore lift
up the eyes of your souls, and see how in the whole world all nations
are blessed in Abraham’s seed. Abraham, in his day, believed what was
not yet seen; but you who see it refuse to believe what has been
fulfilled. <span id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957.md) The Lord’s death
was the ransom of the world; He paid the price for the whole world; and
you do not dwell in concord with the whole world, as would be for your
advantage, but stand apart and strive contentiously to destroy the whole
world, to your own loss. Hear now what is said in the Psalm concerning
this ransom: “They pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell all my
bones; they look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them,
and cast lots upon my vesture.” <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) Wherefore will you be guilty of
dividing the garments of the Lord, and not hold in common with the whole
world that coat of charity, woven from above throughout, which even His
executioners did not rend? In the same Psalm we read that the whole
world holds this, for he says: “All the ends of the world shall remember
and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall
worship before Thee; for the kingdom is the Lord’s, and He is the
Governor among the nations.” <span id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md)
Open the ears of your soul, and hear: “The mighty God, even the <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.1.LXXVI-p11.2"></span>Lord</span>, hath spoken,
and called the earth, from the rising of the sun unto the going down
thereof; out of Zion, the perfection of beauty.” <span
id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md) If you do not wish to understand
this, hear the gospel from the Lord’s own lips, how He said: “All things
must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the
Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Him; and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations,
beginning at Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md) The
words in the Psalm, “the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going
down thereof,” correspond to these in the Gospel, “among all nations;”
and as He said in the Psalm, “from Zion, the perfection of beauty,” He
has said in the Gospel, “beginning at Jerusalem.”

<span id="vii.1.LXXVI-p14"></span>2. Your imagination that you are
separating yourselves, before the time of the harvest, from the tares
which are mixed with the wheat, proves that you are only tares. For if
you were wheat, you would bear with the tares, and not separate
yourselves from that which is growing in Christ’s field. Of the tares,
indeed, it has been said, “Because iniquity shall abound, the love of
many shall wax cold;” but of the wheat it is said, “He that shall endure
unto the end, the same shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md) What grounds have you for believing
that the tares have increased and filled the world, and that the wheat
has decreased, and is found now in Africa alone? You claim to be
Christians, and you disclaim the authority of Christ. He said, “Let both
grow together till the harvest;” He said not, “Let the wheat decrease,
and let the tares multiply.” He said, “The field is the world;” He said
not, “The field is Africa.” He said, “The harvest is the end of the
world;” He said not, “The harvest is the time of Donatus.” He said, “The
reapers are the angels;” He said not, “The reapers are the captains of
the Circumcelliones.” <span id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md) But
you, by charging the good wheat with being tares, have proved yourselves
to be tares; and <span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="vii.1.LXXVI-Page_344"></span>what is worse, you have prematurely
separated yourselves from the wheat. For some of your predecessors, in
whose impious schism you obstinately remain, delivered up to persecutors
the sacred <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXVI-p16.2"></span>Mss.</span> and the vessels of the Church
(as may be seen in municipal records <span
id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964) .md); others of them passed over the
fault which these men confessed, and remained in communion with them;
and both parties having come together to Carthage as an infatuated
faction, condemned others without a hearing, on the charge of that fault
which they had agreed, so far as they themselves were concerned, to
forgive, and then set up a bishop against the ordained bishop, and
erected an altar against the altar already recognised. Afterwards they
sent to the Emperor Constantine a letter begging that bishops of
churches beyond the sea should be appointed to arbitrate between the
bishops of Africa. When the judges whom they sought were granted, and at
Rome had given their decision, they refused to submit to it, and
complained to the Emperor or against the bishops as having judged
unrighteously. From the sentence of another bench of bishops sent to
Arles to try the case, they appealed to the Emperor himself. When he had
heard them, and they had been proved guilty of calumny, they still
persisted in their wickedness. Awake to the interest of your salvation!
love peace, and return to unity! Whensoever you desire it, we are ready
to recite in detail the events to which we have referred.

<span id="vii.1.LXXVI-p18"></span>3. He is the associate of wicked men
who consents to the deeds of wicked men; not he who suffers the tares to
grow in the Lord’s field unto the harvest, or the chaff to remain until
the final winnowing time. If you hate those who do evil, shake
yourselves free from the crime of schism. If you really feared to
associate with the wicked, you would not for so many years have
permitted Optatus <span id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md) to remain
among you when he was living in the most flagrant sin. And as you now
give him the name of martyr, you must, if you are consistent, give him
for whom he died the name of Christ. Finally, wherein has the Christian
world offended you, from which you have insanely and wickedly cut
yourselves off? and what claim upon your esteem have those followers of
Maximianus, whom you have received back with honour after they had been
condemned by you, and violently cast forth by warrant of the civil
authorities from their churches? Wherein has the peace of Christ
offended you, that you resist it by separating yourselves from those
whom you calumniate? and wherein has the peace of Donatus earned your
favour, that to promote it you receive back those whom you condemned?
Felicianus of Musti is now one of you. We have read concerning him, that
he was formerly condemned by your council, and afterwards accused by you
at the bar of the proconsul, and in the town of Musti was attacked as is
stated in the municipal records.

<span id="vii.1.LXXVI-p20"></span>4. If the surrendering of the sacred
books to destruction is a crime which, in the case of the king who
burned the book of Jeremiah, God punished with death as a prisoner of
war, <span id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md) how much greater is the
guilt of schism! For those authors of schism to whom you have compared
the followers of Maximianus, the earth opening, swallowed up
alive. <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) Why, then, do you
object against us the charge of surrendering the sacred books which you
do not prove, and at the same time both condemn and welcome back those
among yourselves who are schismatics? If you are proved to be in the
right by the fact that you have suffered persecution from the Emperor, a
still stronger claim than yours must be that of the followers of
Maximianus, whom you have yourselves persecuted by the help of judges
sent to you by Catholic emperors. If you alone have baptism, what weight
do you attach to the baptism administered by followers of Maximianus in
the case of those whom Felicianus baptized while he was under your
sentence of condemnation, who came along with him when he was afterwards
restored by you? Let your bishops answer these questions to your laity
at least, if they will not debate with us; and do you, as you value your
salvation, consider what kind of doctrine that must be about which they
refuse to enter into discussion with us. If the wolves have prudence
enough to keep out of the way of the shepherds, why have the flock so
lost their prudence, that they go into the dens of the wolves?
