<span id="vii.1.LXXXVI-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span

<span id="vii.1.LXXXVI-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.LXXXVI-p3.1"></span>To My Noble Lord Cæcilianus, My Son Truly
and Justly Honourable and Esteemed in the Love of Christ, Augustin,
Bishop, Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.LXXXVI-p4"></span>The renown of your administration and
the fame of your virtues, as well as the praiseworthy zeal and faithful
sincerity of your Christian piety,—gifts of God which make you rejoice
in Him from whom they came, and from whom you hope to receive yet
greater things,—have moved me to acquaint your Excellency by this letter
with the cares which agitate my mind. As our joy is great that
throughout the rest of Africa you have taken measures with remarkable
success on behalf of Catholic unity, our sorrow is proportionately great
because the district of Hippo <span id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084.md)
and the neighbouring regions on the borders of Numidia have not enjoyed
the benefit of the vigour with which as a magistrate you have enforced
your proclamation, my noble lord, and my son truly and justly honourable
and esteemed in the love of Christ. Lest this should be regarded rather
as due to the neglect of duty by me who bear the burden of the episcopal
office at Hippo, I have considered myself bound to mention it to your
Excellency. If you condescend to acquaint yourself with the extremities
to which the effrontery of the heretics has proceeded in the region of
Hippo, as you may do by questioning my brethren and colleagues, who are
able to furnish your Excellency with information, or the presbyter whom
I have sent with this letter, I am sure you will so deal with this
tumour of impious presumption, that it shall be healed by warning rather
than painfully removed afterwards by punishment.
