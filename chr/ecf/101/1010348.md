<span id="vii.1.XLI"></span>

<span id="vii.1.XLI-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.XLI-p1.1"></span>Letter XLI.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XLI-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XLI-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 397.)

<span id="vii.1.XLI-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XLI-p3.1"></span>To Father Aurelius, Our Lord Most Blessed and
Worthy of Veneration, Our Brother Most Sincerely Beloved, and Our
Partner in the Sacerdotal Office, Alypius and Augustin Send Greeting in
the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XLI-p4"></span>1. “Our mouth is filled with laughter,
and our tongue with singing,” <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md)
by your letter informing us that, by the help of that God whose
inspiration guided you, you have carried into effect your pious purpose
concerning all our brethren in orders, and especially concerning the
regular delivering of a sermon to the people in your presence by the
presbyters, through whose tongues thus engaged your love sounds louder
in the hearts than their voice does in the ears of men. Thanks be unto
God! Is there anything better for us to have in our heart, or utter with
our lips, or record with our pen, than this? Thanks be unto God! No
other phrase is more easily spoken, and nothing more pleasant in sound,
profound in significance, and profitable in practice, than this. Thanks
be unto God, who has endowed you with a heart so true to the interests
of your sons, and who has brought to light what you had latent in the
inner soul, beyond the reach of human eye, giving you not only the will
to do good, but the means of realizing your desires. So be it, certainly
so be it! let these works shine before men, that they may see them, and
rejoice and glorify your Father in heaven. <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) In such things delight yourself in
the Lord; and may your prayers for these presbyters be graciously heard
on their behalf by Him whose voice you do not consider it beneath you to
hear when He speaks by them! May they go on, and walk, yea, run in the
way of the Lord! May the small and the great be blessed together, being
made glad by those who say unto them, “Let us go into the house of the
Lord!” <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) Let the stronger lead;
let the weaker imitate their example, being followers of them, as they
are of Christ. May we all be as ants pursuing eagerly the path of holy
industry, as bees labouring amidst the fragrance of holy duty; and may
fruit be brought forth in patience by the saving grace of stedfastness
unto the end! May the Lord “not suffer us to be tempted above that we
are able, but with the temptation may He make a way to escape, that we
may be able to bear it”! <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md)

<span id="vii.1.XLI-p9"></span>2. Pray for us: we value your prayers as
worthy to be heard, since you go to God with so great an offering of
unfeigned love, and of praise brought to Him by your works. Pray that in
us also these works may shine, for He to whom you pray knows with what
fulness of joy we behold them shining in you. Such are our desires; such
are the abounding comforts which in the multitude of our thoughts within
us delight our souls. <span id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) It is
so now because such is the promise of God; and as He hath promised, so
shall it be in the time to come. We beseech you, by Him who hath blessed
you, and has by you bestowed this blessing on the people whom you serve,
to order any of the presbyters’ sermons which you please to be
transcribed, and after revisal sent to us. For I on my part am not
neglecting what you required of me; and as I have written often before,
I am still longing to know what you think of Tychonius’ seven Rules or
Keys. <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md)

<span id="vii.1.XLI-p12"></span>We warmly commend to you our brother
Hilarinus, leading physician and magistrate of Hippo. As to our brother
Romanus, we know how actively you are exerting yourself on his behalf,
and that we need ask nothing but that God may prosper your endeavours.
