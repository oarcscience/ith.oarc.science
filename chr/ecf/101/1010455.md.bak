<span id="vii.1.CCIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CCIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCIII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 420.)

<span id="vii.1.CCIII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCIII-p3.1"></span>To My Noble Lord and Most Excellent and
Loving Son, Largus, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCIII-p4"></span>I received the letter of your
Excellency, in which you ask me to write to you. This assuredly you
would not have done unless you had esteemed acceptable and pleasant that
which you suppose me capable of writing to you. In <span
id="page_558">p. 558</span> <span id="vii.1.CCIII-Page_558"></span>other
words, I assume that, having desired the vanities of this life when you
had not tried them, now, after the trial has been made, you despise
them, because in them the pleasure is deceitful, the labour fruitless,
the anxiety perpetual, the elevation dangerous. Men seek them at first
through imprudence, and give them up at last with disappointment and
remorse. This is true of all the things which, in the cares of this
mortal life, are coveted with more eagerness than wisdom by the uneasy
solicitude of the men of the world. But it is wholly otherwise with the
hope of the pious: very different is the fruit of their labours, very
different the reward of their dangers. Fear and grief, and labour and
danger are unavoidable, so long as we live in this world; but the great
question is, for what cause, with what expectation, with what aim a man
endures these things. When, indeed, I contemplate the lovers of this
world, I know not at what time wisdom can most opportunely attempt their
moral improvement; for when they have apparent prosperity, they reject
disdainfully her salutary admonitions, and regard them as old wives
fables; when, again, they are in adversity, they think rather of
escaping merely from present suffering than of obtaining the real remedy
by which they may be made whole, and may arrive at that place where they
shall be altogether exempt from suffering. Occasionally, however, some
open their ears and hearts to the truth,—rarely in prosperity, more
frequently in adversity. These are indeed the few, for such it is
predicted that they shall be. Among these I desire you to be, because I
love you truly, my noble lord and most excellent and loving son. Let
this counsel be my answer to your letter, because though I am unwilling
that you should henceforth suffer such things as you have endured, yet I
would grieve still more if you were found to have suffered these things
without any change for the better in your life.
