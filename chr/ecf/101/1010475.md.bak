<span id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXIII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p2"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p2.1"></span>To the Eminently Religious Lady and Holy
Daughter Sapida, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p3"></span>1. The gift prepared by the just and
pious industry of your own hands, and kindly presented by you to me, I
have accepted, lest I should increase the grief of one who needs, as I
perceive, much rather to be comforted by me; especially because you
expressed yourself as esteeming it no small consolation to you if I
would wear this tunic, which you had made for that holy servant of God
your brother, since he, having departed from the land of the dying, is
raised above the need of the things which perish in the using. I have,
therefore, complied with your desire, and whatever be the kind and
degree of consolation which you may feel this to yield, I have not
refused it to your affection for your brother. <span
id="fr_3023"></span>[3024](#fn_3023.md) The tunic which you sent I have
accordingly ac<span id="page_592">p. 592</span> <span
id="vii.1.CCLXIII-Page_592"></span>cepted, and have already begun to
wear it before writing this to you. Be therefore of good cheer; but
apply yourself, I beseech you, to far better and far greater
consolations, in order that the cloud which, through human weakness,
gathers darkness closely round your heart, may be dissipated by the
words of divine authority; and, at all times, so live that you may live
with your brother, since he has so died that he lives still.

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p5"></span>2. It is indeed a cause for tears
that your brother, who loved you, and who honoured you especially for
your pious life, and your profession as a consecrated virgin, is no more
before your eyes, as hitherto, going in and out in the assiduous
discharge of his ecclesiastical duties as a deacon of the church of
Carthage, and that you shall no more hear from his lips the honourable
testimony which, with kindly, pious, and becoming affection, he was wont
to render to the holiness of a sister so dear to him. When these things
are pondered, and are regretfully desired <span
id="fr_3024"></span>[3025](#fn_3024.md) with all the vehemence of
long-cherished affection, the heart is pierced, and, like blood from the
pierced heart, tears flow apace. But let your heart rise heavenward, and
your eyes will cease to weep. <span id="fr_3025"></span>[3026](#fn_3025.md)
The things over the loss of which you mourn have indeed passed away, for
they were in their nature temporary, but their loss does not involve the
annihilation of that love with which Timotheus loved \[his sister\]
Sapida, and loves her still: it abides in its own treasury, and is
hidden with Christ in God. Does the miser lose his gold when he stores
it in a secret place? Does he not then become, so far as lies in his
power, more confidently assured that the gold is in his possession when
he keeps it in some safer hiding-place, where it is hidden even from his
eyes? Earthly covetousness believes that it has found a safer
guardianship for its loved treasures when it no longer sees them; and
shall heavenly love sorrow as if it had lost for ever that which it has
only sent before it to the garner of the upper world? O Sapida, give
yourself wholly to your high calling, and set your affections <span
id="fr_3026"></span>[3027](#fn_3026.md) on things above, where, at the
right hand of God, Christ sitteth, who condescended for us to die, that
we, though we were dead, might live, and to secure that no man should
fear death as if it were destined to destroy him, and that no one of
those for whom the Life died should after death be mourned for as if he
had lost life. Take to yourself these and other similar divine
consolations, before which human sorrow may blush and flee away.

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p9"></span>3. There is nothing in the sorrow of
mortals over their dearly beloved dead which merits displeasure; but the
sorrow of believers ought not to be prolonged. If, therefore, you have
been grieved till now, let this grief suffice, and sorrow not as do the
heathen, “who have no hope.” <span id="fr_3027"></span>[3028](#fn_3027.md)
For when the Apostle Paul said this, he did not prohibit sorrow
altogether, but only such sorrow as the heathen manifest who have no
hope. For even Martha and Mary, pious sisters, and believers, wept for
their brother Lazarus, of whom they knew that he would rise again,
though they knew not that he was at that time to be restored to life;
and the Lord Himself wept for that same Lazarus, whom He was going to
bring back from death; <span id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028.md)
wherein doubtless He by His example permitted, though He did not by any
precept enjoin, the shedding of tears over the graves even of those
regarding whom we believe that they shall rise again to the true life.
Nor is it without good reason that Scripture saith in the book of
Ecclesiasticus: “Let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament
as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself;” but adds, a little
further on, this counsel, “and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness.
For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh
strength.” <span id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029.md)

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p13"></span>4. Your brother, my daughter, is
alive as to the soul, is asleep as to the body: “Shall not he who sleeps
also rise again from sleep?” <span id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030.md)
God, who has already received his spirit, shall again give back to him
his body, which He did not take away to annihilate, but only took aside
to restore. There is therefore no reason for protracted sorrow, since
there is a much stronger reason for everlasting joy. For even the mortal
part of your brother, which has been buried in the earth, shall not be
for ever lost to you;—that part in which he was visibly present with
you, through which also he addressed you and conversed with you, by
which he spoke with a voice not less thoroughly known to your ear than
was his countenance when presented to your eyes, so that, wherever the
sound of his voice was heard, even though he was not seen, he used to be
at once recognised by you. These things are indeed withdrawn so as to be
no longer perceived by the senses of the living, that the absence of the
dead may make surviving friends mourn for them. But seeing that even the
bodies of the dead shall not perish (as not even a hair of the head
shall perish), <span id="fr_3031"></span>[3032](#fn_3031.md) but shall,
after being laid aside for a time, be received again never more to be
laid aside, but fixed finally in the higher condition of existence into
which they shall have <span id="page_593">p. 593</span> <span
id="vii.1.CCLXIII-Page_593"></span>been changed, certainly there is more
cause for thankfulness in the sure hope for an immeasurable eternity,
than for sorrow in the transient experience of a very short span of
time. This hope the heathen do not possess, because they know not the
Scriptures nor the power of God, <span
id="fr_3032"></span>[3033](#fn_3032.md) who is able to restore what was
lost, to quicken what was dead, to renew what has been subjected to
corruption, to re-unite things which have been severed from each other,
and to preserve thenceforward for evermore what was originally
corruptible and shortlived. These things He has promised, who has, by
the fulfilment of other promises, given our faith good ground to believe
that these also shall be fulfilled. Let your faith often discourse now
to you on these things, because your hope shall not be disappointed,
though your love may be now for a season interrupted in its exercise;
ponder these things; in them find more solid and abundant consolation.
For if the fact that I now wear (because he could not) the garment which
you had woven for your brother yields some comfort to you, how much more
full and satisfactory the comfort which you should find in considering
that he for whom this was prepared, and who then did not require an
imperishable garment, shall be clothed with incorruption and
immortality!

id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p4"></span> The hesitation which Augustin here
indicates in regard to accepting this gift may be understood from the
following sentences of one of his sermons:—“Let no one give me a present
of clothing, whether linen, or tunic, or any other article of dress,
except as a gift to be used in common by my brethren and myself. I will
accept nothing for myself which is not to be of service to our
community, because I do not wish to have anything which does not equally
belong to all the rest. Wherefore I request you, my brethren, to offer
me no gift of apparel which may not be worn by the others as suitably as
by me. A gift of costly raiment, for example, may sometimes be presented
to me as becoming apparel for a bishop to wear; but it is not becoming
for Augustin, who is poor, and who is the son of poor parents. Would you
have men say that in the Church I found means to obtain richer clothing
than I could have had in my father’s house, or in the pursuit of secular
employment? That would be a shame to me! The clothing worn by me must be
such that I can give it to my brethren if they require it. I do not wish
anything which would not be suitable for a presbyter, a deacon, or a
sub-deacon, for I receive everything in common with them. If gifts of
more costly apparel be given to me, I shall sell them, as has been my
custom hitherto, in order that, if the dress be not available for all,
the money realized by the sale may be a common benefit. I sell them
accordingly, and distribute their price among the poor. Wherefore if any
wish me to wear articles of clothing presented to me as gifts let them
give such clothing as shall not make me blush when I use it. For I
assure you that a costly dress makes me blush, because it is not in
harmony with my profession, or with such exhortations as I now give to
you, and ill becomes one whose frame is bent, and whose locks are
whitened, as you see, by age.”—*Sermon* 356, Bened. edition, vol. v.
col. 1389, quoted by Tillemont, xiii. p. 222.

<span id="vii.1.CCLXIII-p6"></span> For *requiritur* the Benedictine
editors suggest *recurrit*, as a conjectural emendation of the text. We
propose, and adopt in the translation, a simpler and perhaps more
probable alteration, and read *requiruntur*.

employed, there is an allusion to her name (Sapida), which he has with a
view to this repeated immediately before.
