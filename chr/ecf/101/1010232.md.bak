id="vi.XI.XXXI-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—How the Knowledge of God
Differs from that of Man.</span>

<span id="vi.XI.XXXI-p2"></span>41. O Lord my God, what is that secret
place of Thy mystery, and how far thence have the consequences of my
transgressions cast me? Heal my eyes, that I may enjoy Thy light.
Surely, if there be a mind, so greatly abounding in knowledge and
foreknowledge, to which all things past and future are so known as one
psalm is well known to me, that mind is exceedingly wonderful, and very
astonishing; because whatever is so past, and whatever is to come of
after ages, is no more concealed from Him than was it hidden from me
when singing that psalm, what and how much of it had been sung from the
beginning, what and how much remained unto the end. But far be it that
Thou, the Creator of the universe, the Creator of souls and <span
id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span
id="vi.XI.XXXI-Page_175"></span>bodies,—far be it that Thou shouldest
know all things future and past. Far, far more wonderfully, and far more
mysteriously, Thou knowest them. <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) For it is not as the feelings of
one singing known things, or hearing a known song, are—through
expectation of future words, and in remembrance of those that are
past—varied, and his senses divided, that anything happeneth unto Thee,
unchangeably eternal, that is, the truly eternal <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) Creator of minds. As, then, Thou in
the Beginning knewest the heaven and the earth without any change of Thy
knowledge, so in the Beginning didst Thou make heaven and earth without
any distraction of Thy action. <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) Let him who understandeth confess
unto Thee; and let him who understandeth not, confess unto Thee. Oh, how
exalted art Thou, and yet the humble in heart are Thy dwelling-place;
for Thou raisest up those that are bowed down, <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) and they whose exaltation Thou art
fall not.

<span id="vi.XI.XXXI-p3"></span> Dean Mansel’s argument, in his *Bampton
Lectures*, as to our knowledge of the Infinite, is well worthy of
consideration. He refers to Augustin’s views on the subject of this book
in note 13 to his third lecture, and in the text itself says: “The
limited character of all existence which can be conceived as having a
continuous duration, or as made up of successive moments, is so far
manifest that it has been assumed almost as an axiom, by philosophical
theologians, that in the existence of God there is no distinction
between past, present, and future. ‘In the changes of things,’ say
Augustin, ‘there is a past and a future; in God there is a present, in
which neither past nor future can be.’ ‘Eternity,’ says Beethius, ‘is
the perfect possession of interminable life, and of all that life at
once;’ and Aquinas, accepting the definition, adds, ‘Eternity has no
succession, but exists all together.’ But whether this assertion be
literally true or not (and this we have no means of ascertaining), it is
clear that such a mode of existence is altogether inconceivable by us,
and that the words in which it is described represent not thought, but
the refusal to think at all.” See notes to xiii. 12, below.

<span id="vi.XI.XXXI-p4"></span> “With God, indeed, all things are
arranged and fixed; and when He seemeth to act upon sudden motive, He
doth nothing but what He foreknew that He should do from eternity” (Aug.
*in Ps.* cvi. 35). With this passage may well be compared Dean Mansel’s
remarks (*Bampton Lectures*, lect. vi., and notes 23–25) on the
doctrine, that the world is but a machine and is not under the continual
government and direction of God. See also note 4, on p. 80 and note 2 on
p. 136, above.
