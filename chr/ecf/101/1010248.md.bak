<span id="vi.XII.XV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.XII.XV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—He Argues Against Adversaries
Concerning the Heaven of Heavens.</span>

<span id="vi.XII.XV-p2"></span>18. “Will you say that these things are
false, which, with a strong voice, Truth tells me in my inner ear,
concerning the very eternity of the Creator, that His substance is in no
wise changed by time, nor that His will is separate from His substance?
Wherefore, He willeth not one thing now, another anon, but once and for
ever He willeth all things that He willeth; not again and again, nor now
this, now that; nor willeth afterwards what He willeth not before, nor
willeth not what before He willed. Because such a will is mutable and no
mutable thing is eternal; but our God is eternal. <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md) Likewise He tells me, tells me in
my inner ear, that the expectation of future things is turned to sight
when they have come; and this same sight is turned to memory when they
have passed. Moreover, all thought which is thus varied is mutable, and
nothing mutable is eternal; but our God is eternal.” These things I sum
up and put together, and I find that my God, the eternal God, hath not
made any creature by any new will, nor that His knowledge suffereth
anything transitory.

<span id="vi.XII.XV-p4"></span>19. What, therefore, will ye say, ye
objectors? Are these things false? “No,” they say. “What is this? Is it
false, then, that every nature already formed, or matter formable, is
only from Him who is supremely good, because He is supreme? . . . .
Neither do we deny this,” say they. “What then? Do you deny this, that
there is a certain sublime creature, clinging with so chaste a love with
the true and truly eternal God, that although it be not co-eternal with
Him, yet it separateth itself not from Him, nor floweth into any variety
and vicissitude of times, but resteth in the truest contemplation of Him
only?” Since Thou, O God, showest Thyself unto him, and sufficest him,
who loveth Thee as much as Thou commandest, and, therefore, he declineth
not from Thee, nor toward himself. <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) This is the house of God, <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) not earthly, nor of any celestial
bulk corporeal, but a spiritual house and a partaker of Thy eternity,
because without blemish for ever. For Thou hast made it fast for ever
and ever; Thou hast given it a law, which it shall not pass. <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) Nor yet is it co-eternal with Thee,
O God, because not without beginning, for it was made.

<span id="vi.XII.XV-p8"></span>20. For although we find no time before
it, for wisdom was created before all things, <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) —not certainly that Wisdom
manifestly co-eternal and equal unto Thee, our God, His Father, <span
id="page_181">p. 181</span> <span id="vi.XII.XV-Page_181"></span>and by
Whom all things were created, and in Whom, as the Beginning, Thou
createdst heaven and earth; but truly that wisdom which has been
created, namely, the intellectual nature, <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) which, in the contemplation of
light, is light. For this, although created, is also called wisdom. But
as great as is the difference between the Light which enlighteneth and
that which is enlightened, <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) so
great is the difference between the Wisdom that createth and that which
hath been created; as between the Righteousness which justifieth, and
the righteousness which has been made by justification. For we also are
called Thy righteousness; for thus saith a certain servant of Thine:
“That we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.” <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) Therefore, since a certain created
wisdom was created before all things, the rational and intellectual mind
of that chaste city of Thine, our mother which is above, and is
free, <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) and “eternal in the
heavens” <span id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) (in what heavens,
unless in those that praise Thee, the “heaven of heavens,” <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) because this also is the “heaven of
heavens,” which is the Lord’s)—although we find not time before it,
because that which hath been created before all things also precedeth
the creature of time, yet is the Eternity of the Creator Himself before
it, from Whom, having been created, it took the beginning, although not
of time,—for time as yet was not,—yet of its own very nature.

<span id="vi.XII.XV-p16"></span>21. Hence comes it so to be of Thee, our
God, as to be manifestly another than Thou, and not the Self-same. <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) Since, although we find time not
only not before it, but not in it (it being proper ever to behold Thy
face, nor is ever turned aside from it, wherefore it happens that it is
varied by no change), yet is there in it that mutability itself whence
it would become dark and cold, but that, clinging unto Thee with sublime
love, it shineth and gloweth from Thee like a perpetual noon. O house,
full of light and splendour! I have loved thy beauty, and the place of
the habitation of the glory of my Lord, <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) thy builder and owner. Let my
wandering sigh after thee; and I speak unto Him that made thee, that He
may possess me also in thee, seeing He hath made me likewise. “I have
gone astray, like a lost sheep;” <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) yet upon the shoulders of my
Sheperd, <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) thy builder, I hope
that I may be brought back to thee.

<span id="vi.XII.XV-p21"></span>22. “What say ye to me, O ye objectors
whom I was addressing, and who yet believe that Moses was the holy
servant of God, and that his books were the oracles of the Holy Ghost?
Is not this house of God, not indeed co-eternal with God, yet, according
to its measure, eternal in the heavens, <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) where in vain you seek for changes
of times, because you will not find them? For that surpasseth all
extension, and every revolving space of time, to which it is ever good
to cleave fast to God.” <span id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) “It
is,” say they. “What, therefore, of those things which my heart cried
out unto my God, when within it heard the voice of His praise, what then
do you contend is false? Or is it because the matter was formless,
wherein, as there was no form, there was no order? But where there was
no order there could not be any change of times; and yet this ‘almost
nothing,’ inasmuch as it was not altogether nothing, was verily from
Him, from Whom is whatever is, in what state soever anything is.” “This
also,” say they, “we do not deny.”
