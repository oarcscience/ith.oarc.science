<span id="vii.1.CII-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p1.1"></span>Letter CII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 409.)

<span id="vii.1.CII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p3.1"></span>To Deogratias, My Brother in All Sincerity,
and My Fellow-Presbyter, Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.CII-p4"></span>1. In choosing to refer to me questions
which were submitted to yourself for solution, you have not done so, I
suppose, from indolence, but because, loving me more than I deserve, you
prefer to hear through me even those things which you already know quite
well. I would rather, however, that the answers were given by yourself,
because the friend who proposed the questions seems to be shy of
following advice from me, if I may judge from the fact that he has
written no reply to a letter of mine, for what reason he knows best. I
suspect this, however, and there is neither ill-will nor absurdity in
the suspicion; for you also know very well how much I love him, and how
great is my grief that he is not yet a Christian; and it is not
unreasonable to think that one whom I see unwilling to answer my letters
is not willing to have anything written by me to him. I therefore
implore you to comply with a request of mine, seeing that I have been
obedient to you, and, notwithstanding most engrossing duties, have
feared to disappoint the wish of one so dear to me by declining to
comply with your request. What I ask is this, that you do not refuse
yourself to give an answer to all his questions, seeing that, as you
have told me, he begged this from you; and it is a task to which, even
before receiving this letter, you were competent; for when you have read
this letter, you will see that scarcely anything has been said by me
which you did not already know, or which you could not have come to know
though I had been silent. This work of mine, therefore, I beg you to
keep for the use of yourself and of all other persons whose desire for
instruction you deem it suited to satisfy. But as for the treatise of
your own composition which I demand from you, give it to him to whom
this treatise is most specially adapted, and not to him only, but also
all others who find exceedingly acceptable such statements concerning
these things as you are able to make, among whom I number myself. May
you live always in Christ, and remember me.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p5"></span>2. <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p5.1"></span>Question I.</span> Concerning the
resurrection. This question perplexes some, and they ask, Which of two
kinds of resurrection corresponds to that which is promised to us? is it
that of Christ, or that of Lazarus? They say, “If the former, how can
this correspond with the resurrection of those who have been born by
ordinary generations, seeing that He was not thus born? <span
id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) If, on the other hand, the
resurrection of Lazarus is said to correspond to ours, here also there
seems to be a discrepancy, since the resurrection of Lazarus was
accomplished in the case of a body not yet dissolved, but the same body
in which he was known by the name of Lazarus; whereas ours is to be
rescued after many centuries from the mass in which it has ceased to be
distinguishable from other things. Again, if our state after the
resurrection is one of blessedness, in which the body shall be exempt
from every kind of wound, and from the pain of hunger, what is meant by
the statement that Christ took food, and showed his wounds after His
resurrection? For if He did it to convince the doubting, when the wounds
were not real, He practised on them a deception; whereas, if He showed
them what was real, it follows that wounds received by the body shall
remain in the state which is to ensue after resurrection.”

<span id="vii.1.CII-p7"></span>3. To this I answer, that the
resurrection of Christ and not of Lazarus corresponds to that which is
promised, because Lazarus was so raised that he died a second time,
whereas of Christ it is written: “Christ, being raised from the dead,
dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over Him.” <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) The same is promised to those who
shall rise at the end of the world, and shall reign for ever with
Christ. As to the difference in the manner of Christ’s generation and
that of other men, this has no bearing upon the nature <span
id="page_415">p. 415</span> <span id="vii.1.CII-Page_415"></span>of His
resurrection, just as it had none upon the nature of His death, so as to
make it different from ours. His death was not the less real because of
His not having been begotten by an earthly father; just as the
difference between the mode of the origination of the body of the first
man, who was formed immediately from the dust of the earth, and of our
bodies, which we derive from our parents, made no such difference as
that his death should be of another kind than ours. As, therefore,
difference in the mode of birth does not make any difference in the
nature of death, neither does it make any difference in the nature of
resurrection.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p9"></span>4. But lest the men who doubt this
should, with similar scepticism, refuse to accept as true what is
written concerning the first man’s creation, let them inquire or
observe, if they can at least believe this, how numerous are the species
of animals which are born from the earth without deriving their life
from parents, but which by ordinary procreation reproduce offspring like
themselves, and in which, notwithstanding the different mode of
origination, the nature of the parents born from the earth and of the
offspring born from them is the same; for they live alike and they die
alike, although born in different ways. There is therefore no absurdity
in the statement that bodies dissimilar in their origination are alike
in their resurrection. But men of this kind, not being competent to
discern in what respect any diversity between things affects or does not
affect them, so soon as they discover any unlikeness between things in
their original formation, contend that in all that follows the same
unlikeness must still exist. Such men may as reasonably suppose that oil
made from fat should not float on the surface in water as olive oil
does, because the origin of the two oils is so different, the one being
from the fruit of a tree, the other from the flesh of an animal.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p10"></span>5. Again, as to the alleged difference
in regard to the resurrection of Christ’s body and of ours, that His was
raised on the third day not dissolved by decay and corruption, whereas
ours shall be fashioned again after a long time, and out of the mass
into which undistinguished they shall have been resolved,—both of these
things are impossible for man to do, but to divine power both are most
easy. For as the glance of the eye does not come more quickly to objects
which are at hand, and more slowly to objects more remote, but darts to
either distance with equal swiftness, so, when the resurrection of the
dead is accomplished “in the twinkling of an eye,” <span
id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) it is as easy for the omnipotence
of God and for the ineffable expression of His will <span
id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337.md) to raise again bodies which have by
long lapse of time been dissolved, as to raise those which have recently
fallen under the stroke of death. These things are to some men
incredible because they transcend their experience, although all nature
is full of wonders so numerous, that they do not seem to us to be
wonderful, and are therefore accounted unworthy of attentive study or
investigation, not because our faculties can easily comprehend them, but
because we are so accustomed to see them. For myself, and for all who
along with me labour to understand the invisible things of God by means
of the things which are made, <span id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md)
I may say that we are filled not less, perhaps even more, with wonder by
the fact, that in one grain of seed, so insignificant, there lies bound
up as it were all that we praise in the stately tree, than by the fact
that the bosom of this earth, so vast, shall restore entire and perfect
to the future resurrection all those elements of human bodies which it
is now receiving when they are dissolved.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p14"></span>6. Again, what contradiction is there
between the fact that Christ partook of food after His resurrection, and
the doctrine that in the promised resurrection-state there shall be no
need of food, when we read that angels also have partaken of food of the
same kind and in the same way, not in empty and illusive simulation, but
in unquestionable reality; not, however, under the pressure of
necessity, but in the free exercise of their power? For water is
absorbed in one way by the thirsting earth, in another way by the
glowing sunbeams; in the former we see the effect of poverty, in the
latter of power. Now the body of that future resurrection-state shall be
imperfect in its felicity if it be incapable of taking food; imperfect,
also, if, on the other hand, it be dependent on food. I might here enter
on a fuller discussion concerning the changes possible in the qualities
of bodies, and the dominion which belongs to higher bodies over those
which are of inferior nature; but I have resolved to make my reply
short, and I write this for mind so endowed that the simple suggestion
of the truth is enough for them.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p15"></span>7. Let him who proposed these questions
know by all means that Christ did, after His resurrection, show the
scars of His wounds, not the wounds themselves, to disciples who
doubted; for whose sake, also, it pleased Him to take food and drink
more than once, lest they should suppose that His body was not real, but
that He was a spirit, appearing to them as a phantom, and not a
substantial form. These scars would indeed have been mere illusive
appearances if no wounds had gone before; yet even the scars would not
have remained if He had willed it otherwise. But it pleased Him to
retain them <span id="page_416">p. 416</span> <span
id="vii.1.CII-Page_416"></span>with a definite purpose, namely, that to
those whom He was building up in faith unfeigned He might show that one
body had not been substituted for another, but that the body which they
had seen nailed to the cross had risen again. What reason is there,
then, for saying, “If He did this to convince the doubting, He practised
a deception”? Suppose that a brave man, who had received many wounds in
confronting the enemy when fighting for his country, were to say to a
physician of extraordinary skill, who was able so to heal these wounds
as to leave not a scar visible, that he would prefer to be healed in
such a way that the traces of the wounds should remain on his body as
tokens of the honours he had won, would you, in such a case, say that
the physician practised deception, because, though he might by his art
make the scars wholly disappear, he did by the same art, for a definite
reason, rather cause them to continue as they were? The only ground upon
which the scars could be proved to be a deception would be, as I have
already said, if no wounds had been healed in the places where they were
seen.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p16"></span>8. <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p16.1"></span>Question II.</span> Concerning the epoch of
the Christian religion, they have advanced, moreover, some other things,
which they might call a selection of the more weighty arguments of
Porphyry against the Christians: “If Christ,” they say, “declares
Himself to be the Way of salvation, the Grace and the Truth, and affirms
that in Him alone, and only to souls believing in Him, is the way of
return to God, <span id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) what has
become of men who lived in the many centuries before Christ came? To
pass over the time,” he adds, “which preceded the founding of the
kingdom of Latium, let us take the beginning of that power as if it were
the beginning of the human race. In Latium itself gods were worshipped
before Alba was built; in Alba, also, religious rites and forms of
worship in the temples were maintained. Rome itself was for a period of
not less duration, even for a long succession of centuries, unacquainted
with Christian doctrine. What, then, has become of such an innumerable
multitude of souls, who were in no wise blameworthy, seeing that He in
whom alone saving faith can be exercised had not yet favoured men with
His advent? The whole world, moreover, was not less zealous than Rome
itself in the worship practised in the temples of the gods. Why, then,”
he asks, “did He who is called the Saviour withhold Himself for so many
centuries of the world? And let it not be said,” he adds, “that
provision had been made for the human race by the old Jewish law. It was
only after a long time that the Jewish law appeared and flourished
within the narrow limits of Syria, and after that, it gradually crept
onwards to the coasts of Italy; but this was not earlier than the end of
the reign of Caius, or, at the earliest, while he was on the throne.
What, then, became of the souls of men in Rome and Latium who lived
before the time of the Cæsars, and were destitute of the grace of
Christ, because He had not then come?”

<span id="vii.1.CII-p18"></span>9. To these statements we answer by
requiring those who make them to tell us, in the first place, whether
the sacred rites, which we know to have been introduced into the worship
of their gods at times which can be ascertained, were or were not
profitable to men. If they say that these were of no service for the
salvation of men, they unite with us in putting them down, and confess
that they were useless. We indeed prove that they were baneful; but it
is an important concession that by them it is at least admitted that
they were useless. If, on the other hand, they defend these rites, and
maintain that they were wise and profitable institutions, what, I ask,
has become of those who died before these were instituted? for they were
defrauded of the saving and profitable efficacy which these possessed.
If, however, it be said that they could be cleansed from guilt equally
well in another way, why did not the same way continue in force for
their posterity? What use was there for instituting novelties in
worship.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p19"></span>10. If, in answer to this, they say that
the gods themselves have indeed always existed, and were in all places
alike powerful to give liberty to their worshippers, but were pleased to
regulate the circumstances of time, place, and manner in which they were
to be served, according to the variety found among things temporal and
terrestrial, in such a way as they knew to be most suitable to certain
ages and countries, why do they urge against the Christian religion this
question, which, if it be asked in regard to their own gods, they either
cannot themselves answer, or, if they can, must do so in such a way as
to answer for our religion not less than their own? For what could they
say but that the difference between sacraments which are adapted to
different times and places is of no importance, if only that which is
worshipped in them all be holy, just as the difference between sounds of
words belonging to different languages and adapted to different hearers
is of no importance, if only that which is spoken be true; although in
this respect there is a difference, that men can, by agreement among
themselves, arrange as to the sounds of language by which they may
communicate their thoughts to one another, but that those who have
discerned what is right have been guided only by the will of God in
regard to the sacred rites which were agreeable to the Divine Being.
This divine will has never been <span id="page_417">p. 417</span> <span
id="vii.1.CII-Page_417"></span>wanting to the justice and piety of
mortals for their salvation; and whatever varieties of worship there may
have been in different nations bound together by one and the same
religion, the most important thing to observe was this how far, on the
one hand, human infirmity was thereby encouraged to effort, or borne
with while, on the other hand, the divine authority was not assailed.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p20"></span>11. Wherefore, since we affirm that
Christ is the Word of God, by whom all things were made and is the Son,
because He is the Word, not a word uttered and belonging to the past but
abides unchangeably with the unchangeable Father, Himself unchangeable,
under whose rule the whole universe, spiritual and material, is ordered
in the way best adapted to different times and places, and that He has
perfect wisdom and knowledge as to what should be done, and when and
where everything should be done in the controlling and ordering of the
universe,—most certainly, both before He gave being to the Hebrew
nation, by which He was pleased, through sacraments suited to the time,
to prefigure the manifestation of Himself in His advent, and during the
time of the Jewish commonwealth, and, after that, when He manifested
Himself in the likeness of mortals to mortal men in the body which He
received from the Virgin, and thenceforward even to our day, in which He
is fulfilling all which He predicted of old by the prophets, and from
this present time on to the end of the world, when He shall separate the
holy from the wicked, and give to every man his due recompense,—in all
these successive ages He is the same Son of God, co-eternal with the
Father, and the unchangeable Wisdom by whom universal nature was called
into existence, and by participation in whom every rational soul is made
blessed.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p21"></span>12. Therefore, from the beginning of the
human race, whosoever believed in Him, and in any way knew Him, and
lived in a pious and just manner according to His precepts, was
undoubtedly saved by Him, in whatever time and place he may have lived.
For as we believe in Him both as dwelling with the Father and as having
come in the flesh, so the men of the former ages believed in Him both as
dwelling with the Father and as destined to come in the flesh. And the
nature of faith is not changed, nor is the salvation made different, in
our age, by the fact that, in consequence of the difference between the
two epochs, that which was then foretold as future is now proclaimed as
past. Moreover, we are not under necessity to suppose different things
and different kinds of salvation to be signified, when the self-same
thing is by different sacred words and rites of worship announced in the
one case as fulfilled, in the other as future. As to the manner and
time, however, in which anything that pertains to the one salvation
common to all believers and pious persons is brought to pass, let us
ascribe wisdom to God, and for our part exercise submission to His will.
Wherefore the true religion, although formerly set forth and practised
under other names and with other symbolical rites than it now has, and
formerly more obscurely revealed and known to fewer persons than now in
the time of clearer light and wider diffusion, is one and the same in
both periods.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p22"></span>13. Moreover, we do not raise any
objection to their religion on the ground of the difference between the
institutions appointed by Numa Pompilius for the worship of the gods by
the Romans, and those which were up till that time practised in Rome or
in other parts of Italy; nor on the fact that in the age of Pythagoras
that system of philosophy became generally adopted which up to that time
had no existence, or lay concealed, perhaps, among a very small number
whose views were the same, but whose religious practice and worship was
different: the question upon which we join issue with them is, whether
these gods were true gods, or worthy of worship, and whether that
philosophy was fitted to promote the salvation of the souls of men. This
is what we insist upon discussing; and in discussing it we pluck up
their sophistries by the root. Let them, therefore, desist from bringing
against us objections which are of equal force against every sect, and
against religion of every name. For since, as they admit, the ages of
the world do not roll on under the dominion of chance, but are
controlled by divine Providence, what may be fitting and expedient in
each successive age transcends the range of human understanding, and is
determined by the same wisdom by which Providence cares for the
universe.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p23"></span>14. For if they assert that the reason
why the doctrine of Pythagoras has not prevailed always and universally
is, that Pythagoras was but a man, and had not power to secure this, can
they also affirm that in the age and in the countries in which his
philosophy flourished, all who had the opportunity of hearing him were
found willing to believe and follow him? And therefore it is the more
certain that, if Pythagoras had possessed the power of publishing his
doctrines where he pleased and when he pleased, and if he had also
possessed along with that power a perfect foreknowledge of events, he
would have presented himself only at those places and times in which he
foreknew that men would believe his teaching. Wherefore, since they do
not object to Christ on the ground of His doctrine not being universally
embraced,—for they feel that this would be a futile objection if alleged
either <span id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="vii.1.CII-Page_418"></span>against the teaching of philosophers or
against the majesty of their own gods,—what answer, I ask, could they
make, if, leaving out of view that depth of the wisdom and knowledge of
God within which it may be that some other divine purpose lies much more
deeply hidden, and without prejudging the other reasons possibly
existing, which are fit subjects for patient study by the wise, we
confine ourselves, for the sake of brevity in this discussion, to the
statement of this one position, that it pleased Christ to appoint the
time in which He would appear and the persons among whom His doctrine
was to be proclaimed, according to His knowledge of the times and places
in which men would believe on Him? <span
id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) For He foreknew, regarding those
ages and places in which His gospel has not been preached, that in them
the gospel, if preached, would meet with such treatment from all,
without exception, as it met with, not indeed from all, but from many,
at the time of His personal presence on earth, who would not believe in
Him, even though men were raised from the dead by Him; and such as we
see it meet with in our day from many who, although the predictions of
the prophets concerning Him are so manifestly fulfilled, still refuse to
believe, and, misguided by the perverse subtlety of the human heart,
rather resist than yield to divine authority, even when this is so clear
and manifest, so glorious and so gloriously published abroad. So long as
the mind of man is limited in capacity and in strength, it is his duty
to yield to divine truth. Why, then, should we wonder if Christ knew
that the world was so full of unbelievers in the former ages, that He
righteously refused to manifest Himself or to be preached to those of
whom He foreknew that they would not believe either His words or His
miracles? For it is not incredible that all may have been then such as,
to our amazement, so many have been from the time of His advent to the
present time, and even now are.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p25"></span>15. And yet, from the beginning of the
human race, He never ceased to speak by His prophets, at one time more
obscurely, at another time more plainly, as seemed to divine wisdom best
adapted to the time; nor were there ever wanting men who believed in
Him, from Adam to Moses, and among the people of Israel itself, which
was by a special mysterious appointment a prophetic nation, and among
other nations before He came in the flesh. For seeing that in the sacred
Hebrew books some are mentioned, even from Abraham’s time, not belonging
to his natural posterity nor to the people of Israel, and not proselytes
added to that people, who were nevertheless partakers of this holy
mystery, <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) why may we not
believe that in other nations also, here and there, some more were
found, although we do not read their names in these authoritative
records? Thus the salvation provided by this religion, by which alone,
as alone true, true salvation is truly promised, was never wanting to
any one who was worthy of it, and he to whom it was wanting was not
worthy of it. <span id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) And from the
beginning of the human family, even to the end of time, it is preached,
to some for their advantage, to some for their condemnation.
Accordingly, those to whom it has not been preached at all are those who
were foreknown as persons who would not believe; those to whom,
notwithstanding the certainty that they would not believe, the salvation
has been proclaimed are set forth as an example of the class of
unbelievers; and those to whom, as persons who would believe, the truth
is proclaimed are being prepared for the kingdom of heaven and for the
society of the holy angels.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p28"></span>16. <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p28.1"></span>Question III.</span> Let us now look to the
question which comes next in order. “They find fault,” he says, “with
the sacred ceremonies, the sacrificial victims, the burning of incense,
and all the other parts of worship in our temples; and yet the same kind
of worship had its origin in antiquity with themselves, or from the God
whom they worship, for He is represented by them as having been in need
of the first-fruits.”

<span id="vii.1.CII-p29"></span>17. This question is obviously founded
upon the passage in our Scriptures in which it is written that Cain
brought to God a gift from the fruits of the earth, but Abel brought a
gift from the firstlings of the flock. <span
id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) Our reply, therefore, is, that from
this passage the more suitable inference to be drawn is, how ancient is
the ordinance of sacrifice which the infallible and sacred <span
id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span
id="vii.1.CII-Page_419"></span>writings declare to be due to no other
than to the one true God; not because God needs our offerings, seeing
that, in the same Scriptures, it is most clearly written, “I said unto
the Lord, Thou art my Lord, for Thou hast no need of my good,” <span
id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) but because, even in the acceptance
or rejection or appropriation of these offerings, He considers the
advantage of men, and of them alone. For in worshipping God we do good
to ourselves, not to Him. When, therefore, He gives an inspired
revelation, and teaches how He is to be worshipped, He does this not
only from no sense of need on His part, but from a regard to our highest
advantage. For all such sacrifices are significant, being symbols of
certain things by which we ought to be roused to search or know or
recollect the things which they symbolize. To discuss this subject
satisfactorily would demand of us something more than the short
discourse in which we have resolved to give our reply at this time, more
particularly because in other treatises we have spoken of it
fully. <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) Those also who have
before us expounded the divine oracles, have spoken largely of the
symbols of the sacrifices of the Old Testament as shadows and figures of
things then future.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p33"></span>18. With all our desire, however, to be
brief, this one thing we must by no means omit to remark, that the false
gods, that is to say, the demons, which are lying angels, would never
have required a temple, priesthood, sacrifice, and the other things
connected with these from their worshippers, whom they deceive, had they
not known that these things were due to the one true God. When,
therefore, these things are presented to God according to His
inspiration and teaching, it is true religion; but when they are given
to demons in compliance with their impious pride, it is baneful
superstition. Accordingly, those who know the Christian Scriptures of
both the Old and the New Testaments do not blame the profane rites of
Pagans on the mere ground of their building temples, appointing priests,
and offering sacrifices, but on the ground of their doing all this for
idols and demons. As to idols, indeed, who entertains a doubt as to
their being wholly devoid of perception? And yet, when they are placed
in these temples and set on high upon thrones of honour, that they may
be waited upon by suppliants and worshippers praying and offering
sacrifices, even these idols, though devoid both of feeling and of life,
do, by the mere image of the members and senses of beings endowed with
life, so affect weak minds, that they appear to live and breathe,
especially under the added influence of the profound veneration with
which the multitude freely renders such costly service.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p34"></span>19. To these morbid and pernicious
affections of the mind divine Scripture applies a remedy, by repeating,
with the impressiveness of wholesome admonition, a familiar fact, in the
words, “Eyes have they, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear
not,” <span id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) etc. For these words,
by reason of their being so plain, and commending themselves to all
people as true, are the more effective in striking salutary shame into
those who, when they present divine worship before such images with
religious fear, and look upon their likeness to living beings while they
are venerating and worshipping them, and utter petitions, offer
sacrifices, and perform vows before them as if present, are so
completely overcome, that they do not presume to think of them as devoid
of perception. Lest, moreover, these worshippers should think that our
Scriptures intend only to declare that such affections of the human
heart spring naturally from the worship of idols, it is written in the
plainest terms, “All the gods of the nations are devils.” <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) And therefore, also, the teaching
of the apostles not only declares, as we read in John, “Little children,
keep yourselves from idols,” <span id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md)
but also, in the words of Paul, “What say I then? that the idol is
anything, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything?
But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice
to devils, and not to God; and I would not that ye should have
fellowship with devils.” <span id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md) From
which it may be clearly understood, that what is condemned in heathen
superstitions by the true religion is not the mere offering of
sacrifices (for the ancient saints offered these to the true God), but
the offering of sacrifices to false gods and to impious demons. For as
the truth counsels men to seek the fellowship of the holy angels, in
like manner impiety turns men aside to the fellowship of the wicked
angels, for whose associates everlasting fire is prepared, as the
eternal kingdom is prepared for the associates of the holy angels.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p39"></span>20. The heathen find a plea for their
profane rites and their idols in the fact that they interpret with
ingenuity what is signified by each of them, but the plea is of no
avail. For all this interpretation relates to the creature, not to the
Creator, to whom alone is due that religious service which is in the
Greek language distinguished by the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p39.1"></span> λατρεία</span>. Neither do we say that the
earth, the seas, the heaven, the sun, the moon, the stars, and any other
celestial influences which may be beyond our ken are demons; but since
all created things are divided into material and immaterial, the latter
of which we also call spir<span id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span
id="vii.1.CII-Page_420"></span>itual, it is manifest that what is done
by us under the power of piety and religion proceeds from the faculty of
our souls known as the will, which belongs to the spiritual creation,
and is therefore to be preferred to all that is material. Whence it is
inferred that sacrifice must not be offered to anything material. There
remains, therefore, the spiritual part of creation, which is either
pious or impious,—the pious consisting of men and angels who are
righteous, and who duly serve God; the impious consisting of wicked men
and angels, whom we also call devils. Now, that sacrifice must not be
offered to a spiritual creature, though righteous, is obvious from this
consideration, that the more pious and submissive to God any creature
is, the less does he presume to aspire to that honour which he knows to
be due to God alone. How much worse, therefore, is it to sacrifice to
devils, that is, to a wicked spiritual creature, which, dwelling in this
comparatively dark heaven nearest to earth, as in the prison assigned to
him in the air, is doomed to eternal punishment. Wherefore, even when
men say that they are offering sacrifices to the higher celestial
powers, which are not devils, and imagine that the only difference
between us and them is in a name, because they call them gods and we
call them angels, the only beings which really present themselves to
these men, who are given over to be the sport of manifold deceptions,
are the devils who find delight and, in a sense, nourishment in the
errors of mankind. For the holy angels do not approve of any sacrifice
except what is offered, agreeably to the teaching of true wisdom and
true religion, unto the one true God, whom in holy fellowship they
serve. Therefore, as impious presumption, whether in men or in angels,
commands or covets the rendering to itself of those honours which belong
to God, so, on the other hand, pious humility, whether in men or in holy
angels, declines these honours when offered, and declares to whom alone
they are due, of which most notable examples are conspicuously set forth
in our sacred books.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p40"></span>21. In the sacrifices appointed by the
divine oracles there has been a diversity of institution corresponding
to the age in which they were observed. Some sacrifices were offered
before the actual manifestation of that new covenant, the benefits of
which are provided by the one true offering of the one Priest, namely,
by the shed blood of Christ; and another sacrifice, adapted to this
manifestation, and offered in the present age by us who are called
Christians after the name of Him who has been revealed, is set before us
not only in the gospels, but also in the prophetic books. For a change,
not of the God, who is worshipped, nor of the religion itself, but of
sacrifices and of sacraments, would seem to be proclaimed without
warrant now, if it had not been foretold in the earlier dispensation.
For just as when the same man brings to God in the morning one kind of
offering, and in the evening another, according to the time of day, he
does not thereby change either his God or his religion, any more than he
changes the nature of a salutation who uses one form of salutation in
the morning and another in the evening: so, in the complete cycle of the
ages, when one kind of offering is known to have been made by the
ancient saints, and another is presented by the saints in our time, this
only shows that these sacred mysteries are celebrated not according to
human presumption, but by divine authority, in the manner best adapted
to the times. There is here no change either in the Deity or in the
religion.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p41"></span>22. <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p41.1"></span>Question IV.</span> Let us, in the next
place, consider what he has laid down concerning the proportion between
sin and punishment when, misrepresenting the gospel, he says: “Christ
threatens eternal punishment to those who do not believe in Him;” <span
id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) and yet He says in another place,
“With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) “Here,” he remarks, “is something
sufficiently absurd and contradictory; for if He is to award punishment
according to measure, and all measure is limited by the end of time,
what mean these threats of eternal punishment?”

<span id="vii.1.CII-p44"></span>23. It is difficult to believe that this
question has been put in the form of objection by one claiming to be in
any sense a philosopher; for he says, “All measure is limited by time,”
as if men were accustomed to no other measures than measures of time,
such as hours and days and years, or such as are referred to when we say
that the time of a short syllable is one-half of that of a long
syllable. <span id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md) For I suppose that
bushels and firkins, urns and amphoræ, are not measures of time. How,
then, is all measure limited by time? Do not the heathen themselves
affirm that the sun is eternal? And yet they presume to calculate and
pronounce on the basis of geometrical measurements what is the
proportion between it and the earth. Whether this calculation be within
or beyond their power, it is certain, notwithstanding, that it has a
disc of definite dimensions. For if they do ascertain how large it is,
they know its dimensions, and if they do not succeed in their
investigation, they do not know these; but the fact that men cannot
discover them is no proof that they do not exist. It is possible,
therefore, for something to be eternal, and nevertheless to have a
definite <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="vii.1.CII-Page_421"></span>measure of its proportions. In this I
have been speaking upon the assumption of their own view as to the
eternal duration of the sun, in order that they may be convinced by one
of their own tenets, and obliged to admit that something may be eternal
and at the same time measurable. And therefore let them not think that
the threatening of Christ concerning eternal punishment is not to be
believed because of His also saying, “In what measure ye mete, it shall
be measured unto you.”

<span id="vii.1.CII-p46"></span>24. For if He had said, “That which you
have measured shall be measured unto you,” even in that case it would
not have been necessary to take the clauses as referring to something
which was in all respects the same. For we may correctly say, That which
you have planted you shall reap, although men plant not fruit but trees,
and reap not trees but fruit. We say it, however, with reference to the
kind of tree; for a man does not plant a fig-tree, and expect to gather
nuts from it. In like manner it might be said, What you have done you
shall suffer; not meaning that if one has committed adultery, for
example, he shall suffer the same, but that what he has in that crime
done to the law, the law shall do unto him, *i.e.* forasmuch as he has
removed from his life the law which prohibits such things, the law shall
requite him by removing him from that human life over which it presides.
Again, if He had said, “As much as ye shall have measured, so much shall
be measured unto you,” even from this statement it would not necessarily
follow that we must understand punishments to be in every particular
equal to the sins punished. Barley and wheat, for example, are not equal
in quality, and yet it might be said, “As much as ye shall have
measured, so much shall be measured unto you,” meaning for so much wheat
so much barley. Or if the matter in question were pain, it might be
said, “As great pain shall be inflicted on you as you have inflicted on
others;” this might mean that the pain should be in severity equal, but
in time more protracted, and therefore by its continuance greater. For
suppose I were to say of two lamps, “The flame of this one was as hot as
the flame of the other,” this would not be false, although, perchance,
one of them was earlier extinguished than the other. Wherefore, if
things be equally great in one respect, but not in another, the fact
that they are not alike in all respects does not invalidate the
statement that in one respect, as admitted, they are equally great.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p47"></span>25. Seeing, however, that the words of
Christ were these, “In what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto
you,” and that beyond all question the measure in which anything is
measured is one thing, and that which is measured in it is another, it
is obviously possible that with the same measure with which men have
measured, say, a bushel of wheat, there may be measured to them
thousands of bushels, so that with no difference in the measure there
may be all that difference in the quantity, not to speak of the
difference of quality which might be in the things measured; for it is
not only possible that with the same measure with which one has measured
barley to others, wheat may be measured to him, but, moreover, with the
same measure with which he has measured grain, gold may be measured to
him, and of the grain there may have been one bushel, while there may be
very many of the gold. Thus, although there is a difference both in kind
and quantity, it may be nevertheless truly said in reference to things
which are thus unlike: “In the measure in which he measured to others it
is measured unto him.”

<span id="vii.1.CII-p48"></span>The reason, moreover, why Christ uttered
this saying is sufficiently plain from the immediately preceding
context. “Judge not,” He said, “that ye be not judged; for in the
judgment in which ye judge ye shall be judged.” Does this mean that if
they have judged any one with injustice they shall themselves be
unjustly judged? Of course not; for there is no unrighteousness with
God. But it is thus expressed, “In the judgment in which ye judge ye
shall be judged,” as if it were said, In the will in which ye have dealt
kindly with others ye shall be set at liberty, or in the will in which
ye have done evil to others ye shall be punished. As if any one, for
example, using his eyes for the gratification of base desires, were
ordered to be made blind, this would be a just sentence for him to hear,
“In those eyes by which thou hast sinned, in them hast thou deserved to
be punished.” For every one uses the judgment of his own mind, according
as it is good or evil, for doing good or for doing evil. Wherefore it is
not unjust that he be judged in that in which he judges, that is to say,
that he suffer the penalty in the mind’s faculty of judgment when he is
made to endure those evils which are the consequences of the sinful
judgment of his mind.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p49"></span>26. For while other torments which are
prepared to be hereafter inflicted are visible, torments occasioned by
the same central cause, namely, a depraved will,—it is also the fact
that within the mind itself, in which the appetite of the will is the
measure of all human actions, sin is followed immediately by punishment,
which is for the most part increased in proportion to the greater
blindness of one by whom it is not felt. Therefore when He had said,
“With \[or rather, as Augustin renders it, In\] what judgment ye judge,
ye shall be judged,” He went on to add, “And in what measure ye mete, it
shall be meas<span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="vii.1.CII-Page_422"></span>ured unto you.” A good man, that is to
say, will measure out good actions in his own will, and in the same
shall blessedness be measured unto him; and in like manner, a bad man
will measure out bad actions in his own will, and in the same shall
misery be meted out to him; for in whatsoever any one is good when his
will aims at what is good, in the same he is evil when his will aims at
what is evil. And therefore it is also in this that he is made to
experience bliss or misery, viz. in the feeling experienced by his own
will, which is the measure both of all actions and of the recompenses of
actions. For we measure actions, whether good or bad, by the quality of
the volitions which produce them, not by the length of time which they
occupy. Were it otherwise, it would be regarded a greater crime to fell
a tree than to kill a man. For the former takes a long time and many
strokes, the latter may be done with one blow in a moment of time; and
yet, if a man were punished with no more than transportation for life
for this great crime committed in a moment, it would be said that he had
been treated with more clemency than he deserved, although, in regard to
the duration of time, the protracted punishment is not in any way to be
compared with the sudden act of murder. Where, then, is anything
contradictory in the sentence objected to, if the punishments shall be
equally protracted or even alike eternal, but differing in comparative
gentleness and severity? The duration is the same; the pain inflicted is
different in degree, because that which constitutes the measure of the
sins themselves is found not in the length of time which they occupy,
but in the will of those who commit them.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p50"></span>27. Certainly the will itself endures
the punishment, whether pain be inflicted on the mind or on the body; so
that the same thing which is gratified by the sin is smitten by the
penalty, and so that he who judgeth without mercy is judged without
mercy; for in this sentence also the standard of measure is the same
only in this point, that what he did not give to others is denied to
him, and therefore the judgment passed on him shall be eternal, although
the judgment pronounced by him cannot be eternal. It is therefore in the
sinner’s own measure that punishments which are eternal are measured out
to him, though the sins thus punished were not eternal; for as his wish
was to have an eternal enjoyment of sin, so the award which he finds is
an eternal endurance of suffering.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p51"></span>The brevity which I study in this reply
precludes me from collecting all, or at least as many as I could of the
statements contained in our sacred books as to sin and the punishment of
sin, and deducing from these one indisputable proposition on the
subject; and perhaps, even if I obtained the necessary leisure, I might
not possess abilities competent to the task. Nevertheless, I think that
in the meantime I have proved that there is no contradiction between the
eternity of punishment and the principle that sins shall be recompensed
in the same measure in which men have committed them.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p52"></span>28. <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p52.1"></span>Question V.</span> The objector who has
brought forward these questions from Porphyry has added this one in the
next place: Will you have the goodness to instruct me as to whether
Solomon said truly or not that God has no Son?

<span id="vii.1.CII-p53"></span>29. The answer is brief: Solomon not
only did not say this, but, on the contrary, expressly said that God
hath a Son. For in one of his writings Wisdom saith: “Before the
mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth.” <span
id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md) And what is Christ but the Wisdom
of God? Again, in another place in the book of Proverbs, he says: “God
hath taught me wisdom, and I have learned the knowledge of the
holy. <span id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md) Who hath ascended up
into heaven and descended? who hath gathered the winds in His fists? who
hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of
the earth? What is His name, and what is His Son’s name?” <span
id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md) Of the two questions concluding
this quotation, the one referred to the Father, namely, “What is His
name?”—with allusion to the foregoing words, “God hath taught me
wisdom,”—the other evidently to the Son, since he says, “or what is His
Son’s name?”—with allusion to the other statements, which are more
properly understood as pertaining to the Son, viz. “Who hath ascended up
into heaven and descended?”—a question brought to remembrance by the
words of Paul: “He that descended is the same also that ascended up far
above all heavens;” <span id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) —“Who
hath gathered the winds in His fists?” *i.e.* the souls of believers in
a hidden and secret place, to whom, accordingly, it is said, “Ye are
dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God;” <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) —“Who hath bound the waters in a
garment?” <span id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) whence it could be
said, “As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Christ;” <span id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) —“Who hath
established all the ends of the earth?” the same who said to His
disciples, “Ye shall be witnesses unto Me, both in Jerusalem, and in all
Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” <span
id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md)

<span id="vii.1.CII-p62"></span>30. <span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.CII-p62.1"></span>Question VI.</span> The last question
proposed is concerning Jonah, and it is put as if it were <span
id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span id="vii.1.CII-Page_423"></span>not
from Porphyry, but as being a standing subject of ridicule among the
Pagans; for his words are: “In the next place, what are we to believe
concerning Jonah, who is said to have been three days in a whale’s
belly? The thing is utterly improbable and incredible, that a man
swallowed with his clothes on should have existed in the inside of a
fish. If, however, the story is figurative, be pleased to explain it.
Again, what is meant by the story that a gourd sprang up above the head
of Jonah after he was vomited by the fish? What was the cause of this
gourd’s growth?” Questions such as these I have seen discussed by Pagans
amidst loud laughter, and with great scorn.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p63"></span>31. To this I reply, that either all the
miracles wrought by divine power may be treated as incredible, or there
is no reason why the story of this miracle should not be believed. The
resurrection of Christ Himself upon the third day would not be believed
by us, if the Christian faith was afraid to encounter Pagan ridicule.
Since, however, our friend did not on this ground ask whether it is to
be believed that Lazarus was raised on the fourth day, or that Christ
rose on the third day, I am much surprised that he reckoned what was
done with Jonah to be incredible; unless, perchance, he thinks it easier
for a dead man to be raised in life from his sepulchre, than for a
living man to be kept in life in the spacious belly of a sea monster.
For without mentioning the great size of sea monsters which is reported
to us by those who have knowledge of them, let me ask how many men could
be contained in the belly which was fenced round with those huge ribs
which are fixed in a public place in Carthage, and are well known to all
men there? Who can be at a loss to conjecture how wide an entrance must
have been given by the opening of the mouth which was the gateway of
that vast cavern? unless, perchance, as our friend stated it, the
clothing of Jonah stood in the way of his being swallowed without
injury, as if he had required to squeeze himself through a narrow
passage, instead of being, as was the case, thrown headlong through the
air, and so caught by the sea monster as to be received into its belly
before he was wounded by its teeth. At the same time, the Scripture does
not say whether he had his clothes on or not when he was cast down into
that cavern, so that it may without contradiction be understood that he
made that swift descent unclothed, if perchance it was necessary that
his garment should be taken from him, as the shell is taken from an egg,
to make him more easily swallowed. For men are as much concerned about
the raiment of this prophet as would be reasonable if it were stated
that he had crept through a very small window, or had been going into a
bath; and yet, even though it were necessary in such circumstances to
enter without parting with one’s clothes, this would be only
inconvenient, not miraculous.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p64"></span>32. But perhaps our objectors find it
impossible to believe in regard to this divine miracle that the heated
moist air of the belly, whereby food is dissolved, could be so moderated
in temperature as to preserve the life of a man. If so, with how much
greater force might they pronounce it incredible that the three young
men cast into the furnace by the impious king walked unharmed in the
midst of the flames! If, therefore, these objectors refuse to believe
*any* narrative of a divine miracle, they must be refuted by another
line of argument. For it is incumbent on them in that case not to single
out some one to be objected to, and called in question as incredible,
but to denounce as incredible all narratives in which miracles of the
same kind or more remarkable are recorded. And yet, if this which is
written concerning Jonah were said to have been done by Apuleius of
Madaura or Apollonius of Tyana, by whom they boast, though unsupported
by reliable testimony, that many wonders were performed (albeit even the
devils do some works like those done by the holy angels, not in truth,
but in appearance, not by wisdom, but manifestly by subtlety),—if, I
say, any such event were narrated in connection with these men to whom
they give the flattering name of magicians or philosophers, we should
hear from their mouths sounds not of derision, but of triumph. Be it so,
then; let them laugh at our Scriptures; let them laugh as much as they
can, when they see themselves daily becoming fewer in number, while some
are removed by death, and others by their embracing the Christian faith,
and when all those things are being fulfilled which were predicted by
the prophets who long ago laughed at them, and said that they would
fight and bark against the truth in vain, and would gradually come over
to our side; and who not only transmitted these statements to us, their
descendants, for our learning, but promised that they should be
fulfilled in our experience.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p65"></span>33. It is neither unreasonable nor
unprofitable to inquire what these miracles signify, so that, after
their significance has been explained, men may believe not only that
they really occurred, but also that they have been recorded, because of
their possessing symbolical meaning. Let him, therefore, who proposes to
inquire why the prophet Jonah was three days in the capacious belly of a
sea monster, begin by dismissing doubts as to the fact itself; for this
did actually occur, and did not occur in vain. For if figures which are
expressed in words only, and not in actions, aid our faith, how much
more should our <span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="vii.1.CII-Page_424"></span>faith be helped by figures expressed not
only in words, but also in actions! Now men are wont to speak by words;
but divine power speaks by actions as well as by words. And as words
which are new or somewhat unfamiliar lend brilliancy to a human
discourse when they are scattered through it in a moderate and judicious
manner, so the eloquence of divine revelation receives, so to speak,
additional lustre from actions which are at once marvellous in
themselves and skilfully designed to impart spiritual instruction.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p66"></span>34. As to the question, What was
prefigured by the sea monster restoring alive on the third day the
prophet whom it swallowed? why is this asked of us, when Christ Himself
has given the answer, saying, “An evil and adulterous generation seeketh
after a sign, and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of the
prophet Jonas: for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the
whale’s belly, so must the Son of man be three days and three nights in
the heart of the earth” <span id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) ? In
regard to the three days in which the Lord Christ was under the power of
death, it would take long to explain how they are reckoned to be three
whole days, that is, days along with their nights, because of the whole
of the first day and of the third day being understood as represented on
the part of each; moreover, this has been already stated very often in
other discourses. As, therefore, Jonah passed from the ship to the belly
of the whale, so Christ passed from the cross to the sepulchre, or into
the abyss of death. And as Jonah suffered this for the sake of those who
were endangered by the storm, so Christ suffered for the sake of those
who are tossed on the waves of this world. And as the command was given
at first that the word of God should be preached to the Ninevites by
Jonah, but the preaching of Jonah did not come to them until after the
whale had vomited him forth, so prophetic teaching was addressed early
to the Gentiles, but did not actually come to the Gentiles until after
the resurrection of Christ from the grave.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p68"></span>35. In the next place, as to Jonah’s
building for himself a booth, and sitting down over against Nineveh,
waiting to see what would befall the city, the prophet was here in his
own person the symbol of another fact. He prefigured the carnal people
of Israel. For he also was grieved at the salvation of the Ninevites,
that is, at the redemption and deliverance of the Gentiles, from among
whom Christ came to call, not righteous men, but sinners to
repentance. <span id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) Wherefore the
shadow of that gourd over his head prefigured the promises of the Old
Testament, or rather the privileges already enjoyed in it, in which
there was, as the apostle says, “a shadow of things to come,” <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) furnishing, as it were, a refuge
from the heat of temporal calamities in the land of promise. Moreover,
in that morning-worm, <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) which
by its gnawing tooth made the gourd wither away, Christ Himself is again
prefigured, forasmuch as, by the publication of the gospel from His
mouth, all those things which flourished among the Israelites for a
time, or with a shadowy symbolical meaning in that earlier dispensation,
are now deprived of their significance, and have withered away. And now
that nation, having lost the kingdom, the priesthood, and the sacrifices
formerly established in Jerusalem, all which privileges were a shadow of
things to come, is burned with grievous heat of tribulation in its
condition of dispersion and captivity, as Jonah was, according to the
history, scorched with the heat of the sun, and is overwhelmed with
sorrow; and notwithstanding, the salvation of the Gentiles and of the
penitent is of more importance in the sight of God than this sorrow of
Israel and the “shadow” of which the Jewish nation was so glad.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p72"></span>36. Again, let the Pagans laugh, and let
them treat with proud and senseless ridicule Christ the Worm and this
interpretation of the prophetic symbol, provided that He gradually and
surely, nevertheless, consume them. For concerning all such Isaiah
prophesies, when by him God says to us, “Hearken unto me, ye that know
righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the
reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings: for the moth
shall eat them up as a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool;
but my righteousness shall be for ever.” <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) Let us therefore acknowledge Christ
to be the morning-worm, because, moreover, in that psalm which bears the
title, “Upon the hind of the morning,” <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) He has been pleased to call Himself
by this very name: “I am,” He says, “a worm, and no man, a reproach of
men, and despised of the people.” This reproach is one of those
reproaches which we are commanded not to fear in the words of Isaiah,
“Fear ye not the reproach of men.” By that Worm, as by a moth, they are
being consumed who under the tooth of His gospel are made to wonder
daily at the diminution of their numbers, which is caused by desertion
from their party. Let us therefore acknowledge this symbol of Christ;
and because of the salvation of God, let us bear patiently the
reproaches of men. He is a Worm because of the lowliness of the flesh
which He assumed—perhaps, also, because of His being born of a virgin;
for the worm is generally not begotten, but spontaneously origi<span
id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span id="vii.1.CII-Page_425"></span>nated
in flesh or any vegetable product \[sine concubitu nascitur\]. He is the
*morning*-worm, because He rose from the grave before the dawn of day.
That gourd might, of course, have withered without any worm at its root;
and finally, if God regarded the worm as necessary for this work, what
need was there to add the epithet *morning*-worm, if not to secure that
He should be recognised as the Worm who in the psalm, “pro susceptione
matutina,” sings, “I am a worm, and no man”?

<span id="vii.1.CII-p75"></span>37. What, then, could be more palpable
than the fulfilment of this prophecy in the accomplishment of the things
foretold? That Worm was indeed despised when He hung upon the cross, as
is written in the same psalm: “They shoot out the lip, they shake the
head, saying, He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him; let him
deliver him, seeing he delighted in him;” <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) and again, when this was fulfilled
which the psalm foretold, “They pierced my hands and my feet. They have
told all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They part my garments
among them, and cast lots upon my vesture,” <span
id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) —circumstances which are in that
ancient book described when future by the prophet with as great
plainness as they are now recorded in the gospel history after their
occurrence. But if in His humiliation that Worm was despised, is He to
be still despised when we behold the accomplishment of those things
which are predicted in the latter part of the same psalm: “All the ends
of the world shall remember, and turn unto the Lord; and all the
kindreds of the nations shall worship in His presence. For the kingdom
is the Lord’s; and He shall govern among the nations”? <span
id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) Thus the Ninevites “remembered, and
turned unto the Lord.” The salvation granted to the Gentiles on their
repentance, which was thus so long before prefigured, Israel then, as
represented by Jonah, regarded with grief, as now their nation grieves,
bereft of their shadow, and vexed with the heat of their tribulations.
Any one is at liberty to open up with a different interpretation, if
only it be in harmony with the rule of faith, all the other particulars
which are hidden in the symbolical history of the prophet Jonah; but it
is obvious that it is not lawful to interpret the three days which he
passed in the belly of the whale otherwise than as it has been revealed
by the heavenly Master Himself in the gospel, as quoted above.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p79"></span>38. I have answered to the best of my
power the questions proposed; but let him who proposed them become now a
Christian at once, lest, if he delay until he has finished the
discussion of all difficulties connected with the sacred books, he come
to the end of this life before he pass from death to life. For it is
reasonable that he inquire as to the resurrection of the dead before he
is admitted to the Christian sacraments. Perhaps he ought also to be
allowed to insist on preliminary discussion of the question proposed
concerning Christ—why He came so late in the world’s history, and of a
few great questions besides, to which all others are subordinate. But to
think of finishing all such questions as those concerning the words, “In
what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you,” and concerning
Jonah, before he becomes a Christian, is to betray great unmindfulness
of man’s limited capacities, and of the shortness of the life which
remains to him. For there are innumerable questions the solution of
which is not to be demanded before we believe, lest life be finished by
us in unbelief. When, however, the Christian faith has been thoroughly
received, these questions behove to be studied with the utmost diligence
for the pious satisfaction of the minds of believers. Whatever is
discovered by such study ought to be imparted to others without vain
self-complacency; if anything still remain hidden, we must bear with
patience an imperfection of knowledge which is not prejudicial to
salvation.

<span id="vii.1.CII-p24"></span> Augustin, having been informed by
Hilary (*Ep.* 219) that this passage was quoted by Semipelagians in
defence of their error, made the following remark on it in his work *De
Prædestinatione Sanctorum*, c. ix.: “Do you not observe that my design
in this sentence was, without excluding the secret counsel of God and
any other causes, to say, in reference to Christ’s foreknowledge, what
seemed sufficient to reduce to silence the unbelief of the Pagans by
whom the objection had been raised? For what is more certain than this,
that Christ foreknew who would believe in Him, and in what time and
place they would live? But I did not deem it necessary, in that
connection, to investigate and discuss the question as to this faith in
Christ preached to them, whether they would have it of themselves or
would receive it from God—in other words, whether God merely foreknew,
or also predestinated them. The sentence, therefore, ‘that it pleased
Christ to appoint the time in which He would appear, and the persons
among whom His doctrine was to be proclaimed, according to His knowledge
of the times and places in which men would believe in Him,’ might have
been put thus: that it pleased Christ to appoint the time in which He
would appear, and the persons among whom His doctrine was to be
proclaimed, according to His knowledge of the times and places in which
those would be found who had been chosen in Him before the foundation of
the world.”

<span id="vii.1.CII-p27"></span> On these words Augustin remarks in his
*Retractations*, Book II. ch. xxxi.: “This I said, not meaning that any
one could be worthy through his own merit, but in the same sense as the
apostle said, ‘Not of works, but of Him that calleth; it was said unto
her, “The elder shall serve the younger”’ ([Rom.
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.1.CII-p27.1"></span>),—a calling which he affirms to pertain to
the purpose of God. For which reason he says, ‘Not according to our
works, but according to His own purpose and grace’ ([2 Tim.
1.9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.1.CII-p27.2"></span>); and again, ‘We know that all things work
together for good to them that love God, to them that are called
according to His purpose’ ([Rom.
8.28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md)<span
id="vii.1.CII-p27.3"></span>). Of which calling he says, ‘That our God
would count you worthy of this calling’ ([2 Thess.
1.11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.1.CII-p27.4"></span>).”
