<span id="vi.XIII.XXXV-p2"></span>50. O Lord God, grant Thy peace unto
us, for Thou hast supplied us with all things,—the peace of rest, the
peace of the Sabbath, which hath no evening. For all this most beautiful
order of things, “very good” (all their courses being finished), is to
pass away, for in them there was morning and evening.
