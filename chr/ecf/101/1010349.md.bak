id="vii.1.XLII-p1.1"></span>Letter XLII.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XLII-p2"></span>(<span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XLII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 397.)

<span id="vii.1.XLII-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.1.XLII-p3.1"></span>To Paulinus and Therasia, My Brother and
Sister in Christ, Worthy of Respect and Praise, Most Eminent for Piety,
Augustin Sends Greeting in the Lord.</span>

<span id="vii.1.XLII-p4"></span>Could this have been hoped or expected
by us, that now by our brother Severus we should have to claim the
answer which your love has not yet written to us, so long and so
impatiently desiring your reply? Why have we been doomed through two
summers (and these in the <span id="page_276">p. 276</span> <span
id="vii.1.XLII-Page_276"></span>parched land of Africa) to bear this
thirst? What more can I say? O generous man, who art daily giving away
what is your own, be just, and pay what is a debt to us. Perhaps the
reason of your long delay is your desire to finish and transmit to me
that book against heathen worship, in writing which I had heard that you
were engaged, and for which I had expressed a very earnest desire. O
that you might by so rich a feast satisfy the hunger which has been
sharpened by fasting (so far as your pen was concerned) for more than a
year! but if this be not yet prepared, our complaints will not cease
unless meanwhile you prevent us from being famished before that is
finished. Salute our brethren, especially Romanus and Agilis. <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) From this place all who are with me
salute you, and they would be less provoked by your delay in writing if
they loved you less than they do.
