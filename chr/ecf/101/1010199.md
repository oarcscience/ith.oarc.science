id="vi.X.XLII-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—In What Manner Many Sought the
Mediator.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XLII-p2"></span>67. Whom could I find to reconcile me to
Thee? Was I to solicit the angels? By what prayer? By what sacraments?
Many striving to return unto Thee, and not able of themselves, have, as
I am told, tried this, and have fallen into a longing for curious
visions, <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970) and were held worthy to
be deceived. For they, being exalted, sought Thee by the pride of
learning, thrusting themselves forward rather than beating their
breasts, and so by correspondence of heart drew unto themselves the
princes of the air, <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971) the
conspirators and companions in pride, by whom, through the power of
magic, <span id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972) they were deceived,
seeking a mediator by whom they might be cleansed; but none was there.
For the devil it was, transforming himself into an angel of light. <span
id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973) And he much allured proud flesh, in
that he had no fleshly body. For they were mortal, and sinful; but Thou,
O Lord, to whom they arrogantly sought to be reconciled, art immortal,
and sinless. But a mediator between God and man ought to have something
like unto God, and something like unto man; lest being in both like unto
man, he should be far from God; or if in both like unto God, he should
be far from man, and so should not be a mediator. That deceitful
mediator, then, by whom in Thy secret judgments pride deserved to be
deceived, hath one thing in common with man, that is, sin; another he
would appear to have with God, and, not being clothed with mortality of
flesh, would boast that he was immortal. <span
id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974) But since “the wages of sin is
death,” <span id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975) this hath he in common
with men, that together with them he should be condemned to death.

<span id="vi.X.XLII-p3"></span> It would be easy so to do, since even
amongst believers, as we find from Evodius’ letter to Augustin (*Ep.*
clvi.), there was a prevalent belief that the blessed dead visited the
earth, and that visions had an important bearing on human affairs. See
also Augustin’s answer to Evodius, in *Ep.* clix.; Chrysostom, *De
Sacer.* vi. 4; and on Visions, see sec. 41, note, above.

<span id="vi.X.XLII-p7"></span> In his *De Civ. Dei*, x. 24, in speaking
of the Incarnation of Christ as a mystery unintelligible to Porphyry’s
pride, he has a similar passage, in which he speaks of the “true and
benignant Mediator,” and the “malignant and deceitful mediators.” See
vii. sec. 24, above.
