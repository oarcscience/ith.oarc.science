<span id="vi.X.XXXIV-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="vi.X.XXXIV-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Of the Very Dangerous
Allurements of the Eyes; On Account of Beauty of Form, God, the Creator,
is to Be Praised.</span>

<span id="vi.X.XXXIV-p2"></span>51. There remain the delights of these
eyes of my flesh, concerning which to make my confessions in the hearing
of the ears of Thy temple, those fraternal and devout ears; and so to
conclude the temptations of “the lust of the flesh” <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926) which still assail me, groaning and
desiring to be clothed upon with my house from heaven. <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) The eyes delight in fair and varied
forms, and bright and pleasing colours. Suffer <span id="page_157">p.
157</span> <span id="vi.X.XXXIV-Page_157"></span>not these to take
possession of my soul; let God rather possess it, He who made these
things “very good” <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928) indeed; yet
is He my good, not these. And these move me while awake, during the day;
nor is rest from them granted me, as there is from the voices of melody,
sometimes, in silence, from them all. For that queen of colours, the
light, flooding all that we look upon, wherever I be during the day,
gliding past me in manifold forms, doth soothe me when busied about
other things, and not noticing it. And so strongly doth it insinuate
itself, that if it be suddenly withdrawn it is looked for longingly, and
if long absent doth sadden the mind.

<span id="vi.X.XXXIV-p6"></span>52. O Thou Light, which Tobias
saw, <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929) when, his eyes being
closed, he taught his son the way of life; himself going before with the
feet of charity, never going astray. Or that which Isaac saw, when his
fleshly “eyes were dim, so that he could not see” <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930) by reason of old age; it was permitted
him, not knowingly to bless his sons, but in blessing them to know them.
Or that which Jacob saw, when he too, blind through great age, with an
enlightened heart, in the persons of his own sons, threw light upon the
races of the future people, presignified in them; and laid his hands,
mystically crossed, upon his grandchildren by Joseph, not as their
father, looking outwardly, corrected them, but as he himself
distinguished them. <span id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) This is the
light, the only one, and all those who see and love it are one. But that
corporeal light of which I was speaking seasoneth the life of the world
for her blind lovers, with a tempting and fatal sweetness. But they who
know how to praise Thee for it, “O God, the world’s great
Architect,” <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932) take it up in Thy
hymn, and are not taken up with it <span
id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933) in their sleep. Such desire I to be. I
resist seductions of the eyes, lest my feet with which I advance on Thy
way be entangled; and I raise my invisible eyes to Thee, that Thou
wouldst be pleased to “pluck my feet out of the net.” <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934) Thou dost continually pluck them out,
for they are ensnared. Thou never ceasest to pluck them out, but I,
constantly remain fast in the snares set all around me; because Thou
“that keepest Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.” <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935)

<span id="vi.X.XXXIV-p14"></span>53. What numberless things, made by
divers arts and manufactures, both in our apparel, shoes, vessels, and
every kind of work, in pictures, too, and sundry images, and these going
far beyond necessary and moderate use and holy signification, have men
added for the enthralment of the eyes; following outwardly what they
make, forsaking inwardly Him by whom they were made, yea, and destroying
that which they themselves were made! But I, O my God and my Joy, do
hence also sing a hymn unto Thee, and offer a sacrifice of praise unto
my Sanctifier, <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) because those
beautiful patterns, which through the medium of men’s souls are conveyed
into their artistic hands, <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937)
emanate from that Beauty which is above our souls, which my soul sigheth
after day and night. But as for the makers and followers of those
outward beauties, they from thence derive the way of approving them, but
not of using them. <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938) And though
they see Him not, yet is He there, that they might not go astray, but
keep their strength for Thee, <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939)
and not dissipate it upon delicious lassitudes. And I, though I both say
and perceive this, impede my course with such beauties, but Thou dost
rescue me, O Lord, Thou dost rescue me; “for Thy loving-kindness is
before mine eyes.” <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940) For I am
taken miserably, and Thou rescuest me mercifully; sometimes not
perceiving it, in that I had come upon them hesitatingly; at other times
with pain, because I was held fast by them.
