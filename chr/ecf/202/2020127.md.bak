<span id="ii.vii.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Valentinian goes into the
West; Valens remains at Constantinople, and grants the Request of the
Macedonians to hold a Synod, but persecutes the Adherents of the
‘Homoousion.’*

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.ii-p2.1"></span>Of</span> the emperors one, i.e. Valentinian,
speedily went to the western parts of the empire; for the exigencies of
affairs required his presence thither: meanwhile Valens, residing at
Constantinople, was addressed by most of the prelates of the Macedonion
heresy, requesting that another Synod might be convened for the
correction of the creed. The emperor supposing they agreed in sentiment
with Eudoxius and Acacius, gave them permission to do so: they therefore
made preparations for assembling in the city of Lampsacus. But Valens
proceeded with the utmost despatch toward Antioch in Syria, fearing lest
the Persians should violate the treaty into which they had entered for
thirty years in the reign of Jovian, and invade the Roman territories.
They however remained quiet; and Valens employed this season of external
tranquillity to prosecute a <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span
id="ii.vii.ii-Page_97"></span>war of extermination against all who
acknowledged the *homoousion.* Paulinus their bishop, because of his
eminent piety, he left unmolested. Melitius he punished with exile: and
all the rest, as many as refused to communicate with Euzoïus, he drove
out from the churches in Antioch, and subjected to various losses and
punishments. It is even affirmed that he caused many to be drowned in
the river Orontes, which flows by that city.

Usurper arises at Constantinople named Procopius: and at the Same Time
an Earthquake and Inundation take Place and injure Several
Cities.](2020128.md)
