<span id="ii.x.vi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*The Leaders of Arianism at
this Time.*

<span id="ii.x.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.vi-p2.1"></span>Dorotheus</span> bishop of the Arians, who, as
we have said, <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915) was translated by
that sect from Antioch to Constantinople, having attained the age of one
hundred and nineteen years, died on the 6th of November, in the seventh
consulate of Honorius, and the second of Theodosius Augustus. <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916) After him Barbas presided over the
Arian sect, in whose time the Arian faction was favored by possessing
two very eloquent members, both having the rank of presbyter, one of
whom was named Timothy, and the other George. Now George excelled in
Grecian literature; Timothy, on the other hand, was proficient in the
sacred Scriptures. George indeed constantly had the writings of
Aristotle and Plato in his hands: Timothy found his inspiration in
Origen; he also evinced in his public expositions of the holy Scriptures
no inconsiderable acquaintance with the Hebrew language. Now Timothy had
formerly identified himself with the sect of the Psathyrians; <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917) but George had been ordained by
Barbas. I have myself conversed with Timothy, and was exceedingly struck
by the readiness with which he would answer the most difficult
questions, and clear up the most obscure passages in the Divine oracles;
he also invariably quoted Origen as an unquestionable authority in
confirmation of his own utterances. But it is astonishing to me that
these two men should continue to uphold the heresy of the Arians; the
one being so conversant with Plato, and the other having Origen so
frequently on his lips. For Plato does not say that the second and third
cause, as he usually terms them, had a beginning of existence: <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918) and Origen everywhere acknowledges the
Son to be co-eternal <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919) with the
Father. Nevertheless although they remained connected with their own
church, still they unconsciously changed the Arian sect for the better,
and displaced many of the blasphemies of Arius by their own teachings.
But enough of these persons. Sisinnius bishop of the Novatians dying
under the same consulate, Chrysanthus was ordained in his place, of whom
we shall have to speak by and by.
