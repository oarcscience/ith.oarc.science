<span id="ii.x.xliii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII</span>.—*Calamities of the
Barbarians who had been the Usurper John’s Allies.*

<span id="ii.x.xliii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xliii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the death of the usurper, the
barbarians whom he had called to his assistance against the Romans, made
preparations for ravaging the Roman provinces. The emperor being
informed of this, immediately, as his custom was, committed the
management of the matter to God; and continuing in earnest prayer, he
speedily obtained what he sought; for it is worth while to give
attention to disasters which befell the barbarians. <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) For their chief, whose name was
Rougas, was struck dead with a thunderbolt. Then a plague followed which
destroyed most of the men who were under him: and as if this was not
sufficient, fire came down from heaven, and consumed many of the
survivors. This filled the barbarians with the utmost terror; not so
much because they had dared to take up arms against a nation of such
valor as the Romans possessed, as that they perceived them to be
assisted by a mighty God. On this occasion, Proclus the bishop preached
a sermon in the church in which he applied a prophecy out of Ezekiel to
the deliverance effected by God in the late emergency, and was in
consequence much admired. This is the language of the prophecy: <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033.md)

<span id="ii.x.xliii-p5"></span>‘And thou, son of man, prophesy against
Gog the prince of Rhos, Mosoch, and Thobel. For I will judge him with
death, and with blood, and with overflowing rain, and with hail-stones.
I will also rain fire and brimstone upon him, and upon all his bands,
and upon many nations that are with him. And I will be magnified, and
glorified, and I will be known in the eyes of many nations: and they
shall know that I am the Lord.’

<span id="ii.x.xliii-p6"></span>This application of the prophecy was
received with great applause, as I have said, and enhanced the
estimation in which Proclus was held. Moreover the providence of God
rewarded the meekness of the emperor in various other ways, one of which
was the following.

<span id="ii.x.xliii-p3"></span>Who these barbarians were it is
impossible to find out precisely, and that not because no mention is
made of barbarian inroads on the imperial territories, but because so
many are mentioned by the chronographers and the historians of the Goths
(Jornandes, Prosper Aquitanus, Marcellinus, &c.) that it is impossible
to identify this with any of them to the exclusion of the rest. Rougas
also appears in these historians as Rouas (in Priscus), Roas (in
Jornandes), Rugilas (in Prosper Aquitanus), and is said to be related to
Attila; but nothing certain can be drawn from the accounts.

Ambrose has also used this prophecy, applying it to the Goths, and
exhorted Gratian to make war against them. Cf. Ambrose, *de Fide,* 2.
