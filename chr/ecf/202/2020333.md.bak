id="iii.vii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI</span>.—*Events which
occurred in Alexandria after the Death of Arius. Letter of Constantine
the Great to the Church there*.

<span id="iii.vii.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>The</span> death of Arius did not
terminate the doctrinal dispute which he had originated. <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) Those who adhered to his sentiments
did not cease from plotting against those who maintained opposite
opinions. The people of Alexandria loudly complained of the exile of
Athanasius, and offered up supplications for his return; and Antony, the
celebrated monk, wrote frequently to the emperor to entreat him to
attach no credit to the insinuations of the Melitians, but to reject
their accusations as calumnies; yet the emperor was not convinced by
these arguments, and wrote to the Alexandrians, accusing them of folly
and of disorderly conduct. He commanded the clergy and the holy virgins
to remain quiet, and declared that he would not change his mind nor
recall Athanasius, whom, he said, he regarded as an exciter of sedition,
justly condemned by the judgment of the Church. He replied to Antony, by
stating that he ought not to overlook the decree of the Synod; for even
if some few of the bishops, he said, were actuated by ill-will or the
desire to oblige others, it scarcely seems credible that so many prudent
and excellent bishops could have been impelled by such motives; and, he
added, that Athanasius was contumelious and arrogant, and the cause of
dissension and sedition. The enemies of Athanasius accused him the more
especially of these crimes, because they knew that the emperor regarded
them with peculiar aversion. When he heard that the Church was split
into two factions, of which one supported Athanasius and the other John,
he was transported with indignation, and exiled John himself. This John
had succeeded Melitius, and had, with those who held the same sentiments
as himself, been restored to communion and reestablished in the clerical
functions by the Synod of Tyre. His banishment was contrary to the
wishes of the enemies of Athanasius, yet it was done, and the decrees of
the Synod of Tyre did not benefit John, for the emperor was beyond
supplication or petition of any kind with respect to any one who was
suspected of stirring up Christian people to sedition or dissension.

People from holding Church in any place but the Catholic Church, and
thus the Greater Number of Heresies disappear. The Arians who sided with
Eusebius of Nicomedia, artfully attempted to obliterate the Term
“Consubstantial.”](2020334.md)
