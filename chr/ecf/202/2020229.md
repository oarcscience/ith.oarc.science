<span id="ii.x.xii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Of Chrysanthus Bishop of
the Novatians at Constantinople.*

<span id="ii.x.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the death of Sisinnius,
Chrysanthus was constrained to take upon him the episcopal office. He
was the son of Marcian the predecessor of Sisinnius, and having had a
military appointment in the palace at an early age, he was subsequently
under Theodosius the Great made governor <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934) of Italy, and after that
lord-lieutenant <span id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935) of the British
Isles, in both which capacities he elicited for himself the highest
admiration. Returning to Constantinople at an advanced age, earnestly
desiring to be constituted prefect of that city, he was made bishop of
the Novatians against his will. For as Sisinnius, when at the point of
death, had referred to him as a most suitable person to occupy the see,
the people regarding this declaration as law, sought to have him
ordained forthwith. Now as Chrysanthus attempted to avoid having this
dignity forced upon him, Sabbatius imagining that a seasonable
opportunity was now afforded him of making himself master of the
churches, and making no account of the oath by which he had bound
himself, <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) procured his own
ordination at the hands of a few insignificant bishops. <span
id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937) Among these was Hermogenes, who had
been excommunicated with curses by \[Sabbatius\] himself on account of
his blasphemous writings. But this perjured procedure of Sabbatius was
of no avail to him: for the people disgusted with his obstreperousness,
used every effort to discover the retreat of Chrysanthus; and having
found him secluded in Bithynia, they brought him back by force, and
invested him with the bishopric. He was a man of unsurpassed modesty and
prudence; and thus he established and enlarged the churches of the
Novatians at Constantinople. Moreover he was the first to distribute
gold among the poor out of his own private property. Furthermore he
would receive nothing from the churches but two loaves of the
consecrated bread <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938) every <span
id="page_159">p. 159</span> <span id="ii.x.xii-Page_159"></span>Lord’s
day. So anxious was he to promote the advantage of his own church, that
he drew Ablabius, the most eminent orator of that time from the school
of Troïlus, and ordained him a presbyter; whose sermons are in
circulation being remarkably elegant and full of point. But Ablabius was
afterwards promoted to the bishopric of the church of the Novatians at
Nicæa, where he also taught rhetoric at the same time.

emperors, for the governors of the imperial provinces to be called
consuls, and the title *consularis* became the established designation
of those intrusted with the administration of imperial provinces. See

used partly for the Eucharist and partly as food by the bishop and
clergy.
