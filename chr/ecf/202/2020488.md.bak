<span id="iii.xiii.i-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Successors of Theodosius
the Great. Rufinus, the Prætorian Prefect, is Slain. The Chief Priests
of the Principal Cities. Differences among the Heretics. Account of
Sisinius, Bishop of the Novatians*.

<span id="iii.xiii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.i-p3.1"></span>Such</span> was the death of Theodosius, who
had contributed so efficiently to the aggrandizement of the
Church. <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) He expired in the
sixtieth year of his age, and the sixteenth of his reign. He left his
two sons as his successors. Arcadius, the elder, reigned in the East,
and Honorius in the West. They both held the same religious sentiments
as their father.

<span id="iii.xiii.i-p5"></span>Damasus was dead; and at this period
Siricius was the leader of the church of Rome; Nectarius, of the church
in Constantinople; Theophilus, over the church of Alexandria; Flavian,
over the church of Antioch; and John, over that of Jerusalem. Armenia
and the Eastern provinces were at this time overrun by the barbarian
Huns. <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) Rufinus, prefect of the
East, was suspected of having clandestinely invited them to devastate
the Roman territories, in furtherance of his own ambitious designs; for
he was said to aspire to tyranny. For this reason, he was soon after
slain; for, on the return of the troops from the conquest of Eugenius,
the Emperor Arcadius, according to custom, went forth from
Constantinople to meet them; and the soldiers took this opportunity to
massacre Rufinus. These circumstances tended greatly to the extension of
religion. The emperors attributed to the piety of their father, the ease
with which the tyrant had been vanquished, and the plot of Rufinus to
gain their government arrested; and they readily confirmed all the laws
which had been enacted by their predecessors in favor of the churches,
and bestowed their own gifts in addition. Their subjects profited by
their example, so that even the pagans were converted without difficulty
to Christianity, and the heretics united themselves to the Catholic
Church.

<span id="iii.xiii.i-p7"></span>Owing to the disputes which had arisen
among the Arians and Eunomians, and to which I have already alluded,
these heretics daily diminished in number. Many of them, in reflecting
upon the diversity of sentiments which prevailed among those of their
own persuasion, judged that the truth of God could not be present with
them, and went over to those who held the same faith as the emperors.

<span id="iii.xiii.i-p8"></span>The interests of the Macedonians of
Constantinople were materially affected by their possessing no bishop in
that juncture; for, ever since they had been deprived of their churches
by Eudoxius, under the reign of Constantius, they had been governed only
by presbyters, and remained so until the next reign. The Novatians, on
the other hand, although they had been agitated by the controversy
concerning the Passover, which was an innovation made by Sabbatius, yet
the most of them remained in quiet possession of their churches, and had
not been molested by any of the punishments or laws enacted against
other heretics, because they maintained that the Three Persons of the
Trinity are of the same substance. The virtue of their leaders also
tended greatly to the maintenance of concord among them. After the
presidency of Agelius they were governed by Marcian, a good man; and on
his decease, <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) a little while
before the time now under consideration, the bishopric devolved upon
Sisinius, <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) a very eloquent
man, well versed in the doctrines of philosophy and of the Holy
Scriptures, and so expert in disputation that even Eunomius, who was
well approved in this art and effective in this work, often refused to
hold debates with him. His course of life was prudent and above the
reach of calumny; yet he indulged in luxury, and even in superfluities;
so that those who knew him not were incredulous as to whether he could
remain temperate in the midst of so much abundance. His manners were
gracious and suave in assemblies, and on this account he was esteemed by
the bishops of the Catholic Church, by the rulers, and by the learned.
His jests were replete with good nature, and he could bear ridicule
without manifesting the least resentment. He was very prompt and witty
in his rejoinders. Being once asked wherefore, as he was bishop, he
bathed twice daily, he replied, “Because I do not bathe thrice.” On
another occasion, being ridiculed by a member of the Catholic <span
id="page_399">p. 399</span> <span id="iii.xiii.i-Page_399"></span>Church
because he dressed in white, he asked where it was commanded that he
should dress in black; and, as the other hesitated for a reply, he
continued, “You can give no argument in support of your position; but I
refer you to Solomon, the wisest of men, who says, ‘Let your garments be
always white.’ Moreover Christ is described in the Gospel as having
appeared in white, and Moses and Elias manifested themselves to the
apostles in robes of white.” It appears to me that the following reply
was also very ingenious. Leontius, bishop of Ancyra, in Galatia, settled
in Constantinople after he had deprived the Novatians in his province of
their churches. Sisinius went to him to request that the churches might
be restored; but far from yielding compliance, he reviled the Novatians,
and said that they were not worthy of holding churches, because, by
abolishing the observance of penance, they intercepted the philanthropy
of God. To this Sisinius replied, “No one does penance as I do.”
Leontius asked him in what way he did penance. “In coming to see you,”
retorted Sisinius. Many other witty speeches are attributed to him, and
he is even said to have written several works with some elegance. But
his discourses obtained greater applause than his writings, since he was
best at declamation, and was capable of attracting the hearer by his
voice and look and pleasing countenance. This brief description may
serve as a proof of the disposition and mode of life of this great man.
