<span id="ii.ix.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*On the Death of Theodosius
his Two Sons divide the Empire. Rufinus is slain at the Feet of
Arcadius.*

<span id="ii.ix.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.ii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the death of the Emperor
Theodosius, in the consulate of Olybrius and Probinus or the seventeenth
of January, his two sons undertook the administration of the Roman
empire. Thus Arcadius assumed the government of the East, and Honorius
of the West. <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) At that time
Damasus was bishop of the church at Imperial Rome, and Theophilus of
that of Alexandria, John of Jerusalem, and Flavian of Antioch; while the
episcopal chair at Constantinople or New Rome was filled by Nectarius,
as we mentioned in the foregoing book. <span
id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) The body of the Emperor Theodosius was
taken to Constantinople on the 8th of November in the same consulate,
and was honorably interred by his son Arcadius with the usual funeral
solemnities. <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) Not long afterwards
on the 28th day of the same month the army also arrived, which had
served under the Emperor Theodosius in the war against the usurper. When
therefore <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="ii.ix.ii-Page_138"></span>according to custom the Emperor Arcadius
met the army without the gates, the soldiery slew Rufinus the Prætorian
prefect. For he was suspected of aspiring to the sovereignty, and had
the reputation of having invited into the Roman territories the
Huns, <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) a barbarous nation, who
had already ravaged Armenia, and were then making predatory incursions
into other provinces of the East. On the very day on which Rufinus was
killed, Marcian bishop of the Novatians died, and was succeeded in the
episcopate by Sisinnius, of whom we have already made mention. <span

<span id="ii.ix.ii-p6"></span>Zosimus (V. 5) says Rufinus invited Alaric
and the Goths to invade the Roman territories; Valesius reconciles
Socrates’ and Zosimus’ statements by assuming that they are partial and
supplementary to one another; Rufinus, according to him, invited both
the Huns and the Goths.
