<span id="ii.x.xxxv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*Maximian elected to the
Episcopate of Constantinople, though Some wished Proclus to take that
Place.*

<span id="ii.x.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxv-p2.1"></span>After</span> this there was another debate
concerning the election of a bishop of Constantinople. Many were in
favor of Philip, of whom we have already made mention; but a still
greater number advocated the claims of Proclus. And the candidacy of
Proclus would have succeeded, had not some of the most influential
persons interfered, on the ground of its being forbidden by <span
id="page_173">p. 173</span> <span id="ii.x.xxxv-Page_173"></span>the
ecclesiastical canon that a person nominated to one bishopric should be
translated to that of another city. <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015) The people believing this
assertion, were thereby restrained; and about four months after the
deposition of Nestorius, a man named Maximian was promoted to the
bishopric, who had lived an ascetic life, and was also ranked as a
presbyter. He had acquired a high reputation for sanctity, on account of
having at his own expense constructed sepulchral depositaries for the
reception of the pious after their decease, but was ‘rude in
speech’ <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016) and inclined to live
a quiet life.

<span id="ii.x.xxxv-p3"></span>The canon referred to is probably the
fifteenth of Nicæa, as follows: ‘On account of the numerous troubles and
divisions which have taken place, it has been thought good that…no
bishop, priest, or deacon should remove from one city to another. If any
one should venture, even after this ordinance of the holy and great
Synod, to act contrary to this present rule, and should follow the old
custom, the translation shall be null, and he shall return to the church
to which he had been ordained bishop or priest.’ Cf. also *Apostol.
Can.* 14 and 15, and the twenty-first of the Council of Antioch given by
Hefele, *Hist. of the Ch. Councils,* Vol. II. p. 72.
