<span id="ii.ix.xiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*The Author’s Defence of
Origen.* <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md)

<span id="ii.ix.xiv-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xiv-p3.1"></span>But</span> since carping detractors have
imposed upon many persons and have succeeded in deterring them from
reading Origen, as though he were a blasphemous writer, I deem it not
unseasonable to make a few observations respecting him. Worthless
characters, and such as are destitute of ability to attain eminence
themselves, often seek to get into notice by decrying those who excel
them. And first Methodius, bishop of a city in Lycia named Olympus,
labored under this malady; next Eustathius, who for a short time
presided over the church at Antioch; after him Apollinaris; and lastly
Theophilus. This quaternion of revilers has traduced Origen, but not on
the same grounds, one having found one cause of accusation against him,
and another another; and thus each has demonstrated that what he has
taken no objection to, he has fully accepted. For since one has attacked
one opinion in particular, and another has found fault with another, it
is evident that each has admitted as true what he has not assailed,
giving a tacit approbation to what he has not attacked. Methodius
indeed, when he had in various places railed against Origen, afterwards
as if retracting all he had previously said, expresses his admiration of
the man, in a dialogue which he entitled *Xenon.* <span
id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md) But I affirm that from the censure of
these men, greater commendation accrues to Origen. For those who have
sought out whatever they deemed worthy of reprobation in him, and yet
have never charged him with holding unsound views respecting the holy
Trinity, are in this way most distinctly shown to bear witness to his
orthodox piety: and by not reproaching him on this point, they commend
him by their own testimony. But Athanasius the defender <span
id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span id="ii.ix.xiv-Page_148"></span>of the
doctrine of consubstantiality, in his *Discourses against the
Arians* <span id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) continually cites this
author as a witness of his own faith, interweaving his words with his
own, and saying, ‘The most admirable and assiduous Origen,’ says he, ‘by
his own testimony confirms our doctrine concerning the Son of God,
affirming him to be co-eternal with the Father.’ Those therefore who
load Origen with opprobrium, overlook the fact that their maledictions
fall at the same time on Athanasius, the eulogist of Origen. So much
will be enough for the vindication of Origen; we shall now return to the
course of our history.

<span id="ii.ix.xiv-p2"></span>The views of Origen met with opposition
from the very outset. During his own lifetime he was condemned at
Alexandria, and after his death repeatedly until 541 <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.ix.xiv-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>, and perhaps
also by the fifth general council held at Constantinople in 553. For a
full account of the Origenistic Controversy, see Smith and Wace, *Dict.
