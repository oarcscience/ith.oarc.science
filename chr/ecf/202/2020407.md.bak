<span id="iii.x.xiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*The Partisans of
Macedonius disputed with the Arians concerning Acacius*.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xiv-p2.1"></span>At</span> this period the adherents of
Macedonius, among whom were Eleusius, Eustathius, and Sophronius, who
now began openly to be called Macedonians, as constituting a distinct
sect, adopted the bold measure on the death of Constantius, of calling
together those of their own sentiments who had been convened at
Seleucia, and of holding several councils. They condemned the partisans
of Acacius and the faith which had been established at Ariminum, and
confirmed the doctrines which had been set forth at Antioch, and
afterwards approved at Seleucia.

<span id="iii.x.xiv-p3"></span>When interrogated as to the cause of
their dispute with the partisans of Acacius, with whom, as being of the
same sentiments as themselves they had formerly held communion, they
replied by the mouth of Sophronius, <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) a bishop of Paphlagonia, that while
the Christians in the West maintained the use of the term
“consubstantial,” the followers of Aëtius in the East upheld the dogma
of dissimilarity as to substance; and that the former party irregularly
wove together into a unity the distinct persons of the Father and of the
Son, by their use of the term “consubstantial,” and that the latter
party represented too great a difference as existing in the relationship
between the nature of the Father and of the Son; but that they
themselves preserved the mean between the two extremes, and avoided both
errors, by religiously maintaining that in hypostasis, the Son is like
unto the Father. It was by such representations as these that the
Macedonians vindicated themselves from blame.
