<span id="iii.ix.xii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Aëtius, the Syrian, and
Eudoxius, the Successor of Leontius in Antioch. Concerning the Term
“Consubstantial*.”

<span id="iii.ix.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xii-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time, <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311) Aëtius broached his peculiar
opinions concerning the Godhead. He was then deacon of the church of
Antioch, and had been ordained by Leontius. <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312) He maintained, like Arius, that the
Son is a created being, that He was created out of nothing, and that He
is dissimilar from the Father. As he was extremely addicted to
contention, very bold in his assertions on theological subjects, and
prone to have <span id="page_308">p. 308</span> <span
id="iii.ix.xii-Page_308"></span>recourse to a very subtle mode of
argumentation, he was accounted a heretic, even by those who held the
same sentiments as himself. When he had been, for this reason,
excommunicated by the heterodox, he feigned a refusal to hold communion
with them, because, they had unjustly admitted Arius into communion
after he had perjured himself by declaring to the Emperor Constantine
that he maintained the doctrines of the council of Nicæa. Such is the
account given of Aëtius.

<span id="iii.ix.xii-p5"></span>While the emperor was in the West,
tidings arrived of the death of Leontius, bishop of Antioch. Eudoxius
requested permission of the emperor to return to Syria, that he might
superintend the affairs of that church. On permission being granted, he
repaired with all speed to Antioch, and installed himself as bishop of
that city without the sanction of George, bishop of Laodicea; of Mark,
bishop of Arethusa; of the other Syrian bishops; or of any other bishop
to whom the right of ordination pertained. It was reported that he acted
with the concurrence of the emperor, and of the eunuchs belonging to the
palace, who, like Eudoxius, favored the doctrines of Aëtius, and
believed that the Son is dissimilar from the Father. When Eudoxius found
himself in possession of the church of Antioch, he ventured to uphold
this heresy openly. He assembled in Antioch all those who held the same
opinions as himself, among whom was Acacius, bishop of Tyre, and
rejected the terms, “of like substance,” and “consubstantial,” under the
pretext that they had been denounced by the Western bishops. For Hosius,
with some of the priests there, had certainly, with the view of
arresting the contention excited by Valens, Ursacius, and
Germanius, <span id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313) consented, though
by compulsion, <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314) at Sirmium, as
it is reported, to refrain from the use of the terms “consubstantial”
and “of like substance,” because such terms do not occur in the Holy
Scriptures, and are beyond the understanding of men. <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315) They <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316) sent an epistle to the bishops as
though these sustained the writings of Hosius on this point, and
conveyed their thanks to Valens, Ursacius, and Germanius, because they
had given the impulse of right views to the Western bishops.
