<span id="ii.iv.xxxv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*The Synod not having
come to the Emperor, the Partisans of Eusebius accuse Athanasius of
having threatened to divert the Corn supplied to Constantinople from
Alexandria: the Emperor being exasperated at this banishes Athanasius
into Gaul.* <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md)

<span id="ii.iv.xxxv-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxv-p3.1"></span>This</span> letter rendered those who
constituted the Synod very fearful, wherefore most of them returned to
their respective cities. But Eusebius, Theognis, Maris, Patrophilus,
Ursacius, and Valens, having gone to Constantinople, would not permit
any further enquiry to be instituted concerning the broken cup, the
overturned communion table, and the murder of Arsenius; but they had
recourse to another calumny, informing the emperor that Athanasius had
threatened to prohibit the sending of corn which was usually conveyed
from Alexandria to Constantinople. They affirmed also that these menaces
were heard from the lips of Athanasius by the bishops Adamantius,
Anubion, Arbathion and Peter, for slander is most prevalent when of the
assertor of it appears to be a person worthy of credit. Hence the
emperor being deceived, and excited to indignation against Athanasius by
this charge, at once condemned him to exile, ordering him to reside in
the Gauls. Now some affirm that the emperor came to this decision with a
view to the establishment of unity in the church, since Athanasius was
inexorable in his refusal to hold any communion with Arius and his
adherents. He accordingly took up his abode at Treves, a city of Gaul.
