<span id="iii.xiii.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Eutropius the
Reader, and the Blessed Olympian, and the Presbyter Tigrius, are
persecuted on account of their Attachment to John. The Patriarchs*.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Eutropius</span>, a reader, <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) was required to name the persons
who had set fire to the church; but although he was scourged severely,
although his sides and cheeks were torn with iron nails, and although
lighted torches were applied to the most sensitive parts of his body, no
confession could be extorted from him, notwithstanding his youth and
delicacy of constitution. After having been subjected to these tortures,
he was cast into a dungeon, where he soon afterwards expired.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxiv-p4"></span>A dream of Sisinius concerning
Eutropius seems worthy of insertion in this history. Sisinius, the
bishop of the Novatians, saw in his sleep a man, conspicuous for beauty
and stature, standing near the altar of the church which the Novatians
erected to the honor of Stephen, the proto-martyr; the man complained of
the rarity of good men, and said that he had been searching throughout
the entire city, and had found but one who was good, and that one was
Eutropius. Astonished at what he had seen, Sisinius made known the dream
to the most faithful of the presbyters of his church, and commanded him
to seek Eutropius wherever he might be. The presbyter rightly
conjectured that this Eutropius could be no other than he who had been
so barbarously tortured by the prefect, and went from prison to prison
in quest of him. At length he found him, and in conversation with him
made known the dream of the bishop, and besought him with tears to pray
for him. Such are the details we possess concerning Eutropius.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxiv-p5"></span>Great fortitude was evinced in the
midst of these calamities by Olympias, the deaconess. <span
id="page_415">p. 415</span> <span
id="iii.xiii.xxiv-Page_415"></span>Being dragged for this reason before
the tribunal, and interrogated by the prefect as to her motives in
setting fire to the church, she replied, “My past life ought to avert
all suspicion from me, for I have devoted my large property to the
restoration of the temples of God.” The prefect alleged that he was well
acquainted with her past course of life. “Then,” continued she, “you
ought to appear in the place of the accuser and let another judge us.”
As the accusation against her was wholly unsubstantiated by proofs, and
as the prefect found that he had no ground on which he could justly
blame her, he changed to a milder charge as if desirous of advising her,
finding fault with her and the other women, because they refused
communion with his bishop, although it was possible for them to repent
and to change their own circumstances. They all through fear deferred to
the advice of the prefect, but Olympias said to him, “It is not just
that, after having been publicly calumniated, without having had
anything proved against me in the courts, I should be obliged to clear
myself of charges totally unconnected with the accusation in question.
Let me rather take counsel concerning the original accusation that has
been preferred against me. For even if you resort to unlawful
compulsion, I will not hold communion with those from whom I ought to
secede, nor consent to anything that is not lawful to the pious.” The
prefect, finding that he could not prevail upon her to hold communion
with Arsacius, dismissed her that she might consult the advocates. On
another occasion, however, he again sent for her and condemned her to
pay a heavy fine, for he imagined by this means she would be compelled
to change her mind. But she totally disregarded the loss of her
property, and quitted Constantinople for Cyzicus. Tigrius, a presbyter,
was about the same period stripped of his clothes, scourged on the back,
bound hand and foot, and stretched on the rack. He was a barbarian by
race, and a eunuch, but not by birth. He was originally a slave in the
house of a man in power, and on account of his faithful services had
obtained his freedom. He was afterwards ordained as presbyter, and was
distinguished by his moderation and meekness of disposition, and by his
charity towards strangers and the poor. Such were the events which took
place in Constantinople.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxiv-p6"></span>Meanwhile Siricius had died, after
having administered the bishopric of Rome fifteen years. Anastasius held
the same bishopric three years, and then died, and was succeeded by
Innocent. Flavian, who refused his consent to the deposition of John,
was also dead; and Porphyry, being appointed to succeed him in the
church of Antioch, where he agreed with those who had condemned John,
many of those in Syria seceded from the church in Antioch, and because
they made congregations among themselves, they were subjected to many
cruelties. For the purpose of enforcing fellowship with Arsacius, and
with this Porphyry and Theophilus, the bishop of Alexandria, a law was
established, by the zeal of the powerful at court, that those who were
orthodox should not assemble outside of the churches, and those who were
not in communion with them should be expelled.
