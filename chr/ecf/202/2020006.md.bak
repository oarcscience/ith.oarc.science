id="ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>II. Life of Socrates.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>We</span> cannot but regret the fact that the
age in which Socrates lived cared little, if at all, about recording the
lives of its literary men. The only sources of information in this
respect are the writings themselves of these literary men and the public
records, in case they held the double character of literary men and
political or ecclesiastical officials. As Socrates did not participate
in the public affairs of his day, our information respecting him is
confined to the scanty and incidental items we may gather from his
history. As he was not very fond of speaking of himself, these data are
few and often of doubtful significance. In fact, the reconstruction of
his biography from these scattered items is a matter of difficult
critical investigation.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p3"></span>All that these inadequate materials yield
of his biography may be summed up as follows:

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p4"></span>He was born in Constantinople. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) He nowhere mentions his parents or ancestry,
and no information has reached us on this point from any other source.
The year of his birth is inferred from what he says of his education at
the hands of the grammarians Helladius and Ammonias. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) These grammarians were originally Egyptian
priests living in Alexandria—the former of Jupiter, and the latter of
Pithecus (Simius); they fled from their native city in consequence of
the disturbances which followed the cleansing of the Mithreum and
destruction of the Serapeum by the bishop Theophilus. It appears that at
that time an open conflict took place between the pagans and Christians,
and many of the pagans having taken part in the tumult, laid themselves
open to criminal prosecution, and to avoid this, took refuge in other
cities,—a large number of them naturally in Constantinople.
The*Chronicon* of Marcellinus puts this event in the consulship of
Timasius and Promotus, i.e. 389 <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> Now, as Socrates was very
young <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) when he came to these
grammarians, and it was the custom to send children to the schools at
the age of ten, Valesius has reasoned that Socrates must have been born
in 379; others have named 380 <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) as a
more probable date for this event. Other data for ascertaining the exact
date of Socrates’ birth are of very doubtful significance. He speaks,
for instance, of Auxanon, <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) a Novatian
presbyter, from whom he had received certain information; but as Auxanon
lived till after the accession of Theodosius the Younger in 408 <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span>, it is
impossible to draw any conclusion from this fact. So again Socrates
mentions the patriarchate of Chrysostom in Constantinople (398–403) as
if he had received his information at second hand, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) and thus implies that he was perhaps too
young to be an interested eye-witness of the events of that period. But
how young he was we cannot infer from this fact; and so cannot take the
patriarchate of Chrysostom as a starting-point for our chronology of
Socrates’ life. Still another item that might have served as a datum in
the case, had it been definitely associated with a known event in
Socrates’ career, is his mention of a dispute between the Eunomians and
Macedonians which took place in Constantinople in 394. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) If he were an eye-witness of this
quarrel, he must have been old enough to take an interest in it, hence
about fourteen or fifteen years of age. But this conclusion, even though
it coincides exactly with the date found previously (379), is not at all
certain, as he does not state that he was an eye-witness; and if the
reasoning is correct, then he was not too young to be interested in the
events of Chrysostom’s patriarchate which occurred a little later. Thus,
on the whole, while it is extremely probable that Valesius is right in
setting the date of Socrates’ birth in 379, this event may have taken
place several years later.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p12"></span>Nothing further is known of Socrates’
early life and education except that he studied under Ammonius and
Helladius, as already noted. Valesius has conjectured from the mention
of Troï<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xi"></span>lus, the famous rhetorician, <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) that Socrates must have received
instruction from this teacher also, but with no sufficient
foundation. <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md)

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p15"></span>Socrates always remained a resident of
Constantinople, and was evidently proud of his native city, and fond of
alluding to its history as well as its actual condition. He relates how
the Emperor Constantine enlarged it and gave it its present name in
place of the former heathen name it bore (Byzantium). <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) He speaks of its populousness, and at the
same time of its ability to support its many inhabitants from its
abundant resources. <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) He looks on its
public structures very much as the ancient Israelite did on the ‘towers
and battlements’ of Jerusalem. He mentions especially the walls built by
Theodosius the Younger, the Forums of Constantine and Theodosius, the
Amphitheatre, the Hippodrome with its Delphic tripods, the baths,
especially that called Zeuxippus, <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)
the churches of which he names at different times as many as five; viz.:
the church of the *Apostles*, erected by Constantine especially for the
burying of the emperors and priests; <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) the church of *St. Sophia*, which he
calls ‘the great church’; the church of *St. Irene*, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) located in the same enclosure as that of
St. Sophia; the church of *St. Acacius*, together with its
appendages; <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) and the chapel of *St.
John*, built seven miles outside the city. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) Besides these he also mentions
circumstantially the porch and shambles and porphyry column near which
Arius was attacked with his sudden and fatal illness, <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) the region called Sycæ, and the tomb of
Alexander the Paphlagonian, who was tortured and died in prison during
the temporary supremacy of the Arians. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p25"></span>Although there is no distinct mention of
his ever having left the great city, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) it is improbable that, like his great
Athenian namesake, he was averse to traveling. In fact, his frequent
mention of the customs of Paphlagonians, Thessalians, Cyprians, and
others with minuteness of detail, rather gives the impression that he
had visited these places.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p27"></span>According to the preponderance of
evidence Socrates was trained as a pleader or advocate, and practiced
this profession for a time. Hence his cognomen of *Scholasticus*. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) At the instance of a certain Theodorus he
undertook to write a continuation of the Ecclesiastical History of
Eusebius, bringing it down to the seventeenth consulate of the Emperor
Theodosius the Younger (439 <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p28.1"></span>a.d.</span>). <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md)

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p30"></span>This year is the last definitely
mentioned in his work. He must have lived, however, until some time
after that date, as he speaks of a revision of the first two books of
the History. <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) How much later it is
impossible to tell: it was not certainly till after the end of
Theodosius’ reign; for then he would have brought down his history to
that event, and thus completed his seventh book according to the plan,
which is evident in his whole work, of assigning one complete book to
each one of the emperors comprised in his period.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p32"></span>Of the character of Socrates as a man we
know as little as of the events of his life. Evidently he was a lover of
peace, as he constantly speaks with abhorrence of the atrocities of war,
and deprecates even differences in theological standpoint on account of
the strife and ill-feeling which they engender.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p33"></span><span id="page_xii">p. xii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xii"></span>Socrates’ knowledge of Latin has been
inferred from his use of Rufinus, <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md)
but Dodwell <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) conjectures that
Socrates read Rufinus in a Greek translation, and that such translation
had been made by Gelasius.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p36"></span>Inasmuch as he lived in, and wrote of,
an age of controversies, and his testimony must be weighed according to
his theological standpoint, this standpoint has been made the subject of
careful study. There is no doubt left by his explicit declarations about
his agreement in the main with the position of the orthodox or catholic
church of his age, as far as these are distinguished from those of
Arians, Macedonians, Eunomians, and other heretics. But as to his
attitude towards Novatianism there has been considerable difference of
opinion. That he was a member of the Novatian sect has been held after
Nicephorus Callisti <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) by Baronius,
Labbæus, and others, and argued from various considerations drawn from
his work. Some of these are: that he gives the succession of the
Novatian bishops of Constantinople; <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md)
that he knows and mentions Novatian bishops of other places, e.g. of
Rome, <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) of Scythia, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) of Nicæa; <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) that he mentions Novatian churches as
existing in Phrygia and Paphlagonia, <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) in Lydia, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) in Cyzicum, <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) in Nicæa, <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) in Nicomedia and Cotyæum, <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) and in Alexandria; <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) that he knows and describes their church
edifices; <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) that he knows their
internal troubles and trials, <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)
especially their position on the Paschal controversy; <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) that he gives vent to expressions of a
sympathetic nature with the rigor practiced by the Novatian
church; <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) that he records the
criticisms of Novatians on Chrysostom and the opinion that his
deposition was a just retribution for his persecution of the
Novatians; <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) that he attributes
miracles to Paul, Novatian bishop of Constantinople, <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) takes the testimony of Novatian
witnesses, <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) rejects current charges
against them, <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) and finally speaks of
the death of Novatian as a martyrdom. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md)

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p57"></span>On the other hand, Valesius, followed by
most of the more recent writers on Socrates, claims that all these facts
are due to the extreme impartiality of the historian, his sense of the
justice due to a sect whose good he appreciated, together with his lack
of interest in the differences between their standpoint and that of the
Catholics. Socrates treats other heretical sects with the same generous
consideration, e.g. the Arian Goths, whose death he records as a
martyrdom; <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) and yet he has never
been suspected of inclining towards Arianism. At the same time he
mentions the Novatians as distinct from the Catholic Church, <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) and everywhere implies that the *Church*
for him is the latter.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p60"></span>To account for the apparently different
conclusions to which these two series of considerations point, some have
assumed that Socrates had been a Novatian, but before the writing of his
history had either gradually drifted into the Catholic Church, or for
reasons of prudence had severed his connection with the lesser body and
entered the state church, retaining, however, throughout his whole
course a strong sympathy for the communion of his earlier days. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) Others attribute his favorable attitude
towards Novatianism to his general indifference for theological
refinements, others to mere intellectual sympathy for their tenets. In
the absence of any definite utterance of his own on the subject, a
combination of the last two motives comes nearest to sufficiently
explaining the position of Socrates, although his rather unappreciative
estimate of Chrysostom <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) and his
severe censure of Cyril of Alexandria <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) are both more easily accounted for on the
ground of a more intimate relation between the historian and the
Novatians, as both of the above-named eminent men were declared enemies
of Novatianism.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p64"></span>In other respects it cannot be doubted
that the creed of Socrates was very simple and primi<span
id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xiii"></span>tive. The one essential article in it
was the doctrine of the Trinity; all others were subordinate. Even as to
the Trinity, he would have accepted a much less rigid definition than
the one propounded at Nicæa. As, however, the latter had been generally
adopted by the church, he finds himself defending it against Arianism as
well as against all sorts of compromise. He believed in the inspiration
of the great synods as well as in that of the Scriptures, and was
satisfied to receive without questioning the decisions of the former as
he did the teachings of the latter. He was not, however, particular
about the logical consequences of his theological positions, but ready
to break off upon sufficient extra-theological reasons. His warm defense
of Origen and arraignment of Methodius, Eustathius, Apollinaris, and
Theophilus, <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) for attempting to
belittle the great Alexandrian, shows how his admiration of a genius
came into and modified his estimates. He considered all disputes on
dogmatic statements as unnecessary and injurious, due to
misunderstanding; and this chiefly because the parties in the dispute
did not take pains to understand one another, and perhaps did not desire
to do so because of personal jealousies or previous and private
hatreds. <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) He is willing to refer
such lawful questions on doctrinal points as may come before him to the
clergy for decision, and is never backward about confessing his
ignorance and incompetency to deal with theological refinements.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p67"></span>He makes a cogent defense of the use of
pagan writings by Christians, <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md)
alleging that some of the pagan writers were not far from the knowledge
of the true God; that Paul himself had read and used their works; that
the neglect or refusal to use them could only lead to ignorance and
inability to meet pagans in debate; that St. Paul’s ‘prove all things,
hold fast that which is good,’ <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) and
Jesus Christ’s ‘be ye approved bankers’ <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) gave distinct support to the study of the
whole field of knowledge; and that whatever is worth studying in
non-Christian literature is capable of being separated from the rest and
known as the truth. Socrates himself was acquainted more or less
extensively with the works of Sophocles, Euripides, Plato, Xenophon,
from among the classic writers, besides those of Porphyry, Libanius,
Julian, and Themistius of a later period, and perhaps with those of many
others.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p71"></span>One more characteristic of Socrates must
be mentioned; viz., his respect for the church and its institutions. He
had a high regard for clergymen in virtue of their ordination. And
although, as already shown, he took occasion to express himself
critically of the highest dignitaries, such as Chrysostom and Cyril of
Alexandria, yet the person of a bishop or presbyter is in a certain
sense surrounded by sacredness to him. Monks are models of piety. In his
eulogy of Theodosius the Younger, <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md)
he compares the emperor’s devoutness to that of the monks, making the
latter, of course, the high-water mark in that respect. But even as
respects the ordinances of the church, his regard for them was not
slavish or superstitious. He advocates extremely broad views in regard
to the observance of Easter, considering a very precise determination of
it too formalistic to be consistent with the liberty of the New
Dispensation. So, likewise, in regard to many other of the ceremonies of
the church, he takes pains to show by a description of the various ways
in which they were performed in different quarters that they were not
essential, but of subordinate importance. <span

Socrates speaks of Troilus as a native of Side in Pamphilia, and
mentions Eusebius and Silvanus and Alabius (both the latter bishops) as
distinguished pupils of Troilus, and finally adds that Anthemius, who
during the minority of Theodosius acted as regent, was dependent on the
influence of Troilus; in which connection he further adds that Troilus
was not inferior to Anthemius in political sagacity.

primary meaning of ‘student’ it came to be applied to any one who had
passed through study to the professions, of which the advocate’s was
one. From the absence of the cognomen in Photius’ account of Socrates,

the title was rightly applied to him. Valesius argues from internal
grounds that Socrates was a layman and a lawyer. Harnack, on the other
hand, denies that there is any evidence of juristic knowledge in
Socrates’ *History*, even in such passages as I. 30, 31, and V. 18.
