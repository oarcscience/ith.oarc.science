id="ii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*The Emperor Constantius
ejects Paul after his Election to the Bishopric, and sending for
Eusebius of Nicomedia, invests him with the Bishopric of
Constantinople.*

<span id="ii.v.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span

arrived at Constantinople was highly incensed at the consecration \[of
Paul\]; and having convened an assembly of bishops of Arian sentiments,
he divested Paul of his dignity, and translating Eusebius from the see
of Nicomedia, he appointed him bishop of Constantinople. Having done
this the emperor proceeded to Antioch.
