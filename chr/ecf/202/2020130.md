id="ii.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Engagement between Valens
and Procopius near Nacolia in Phrygia; after which the Usurper is
betrayed by his Chief Officers, and with them put to Death.*

<span id="ii.vii.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.v-p2.1"></span>Under</span> the consulate <span
id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) of Gratian and Dagalaïfus in the
following year, the war was begun. For as soon as the usurper Procopius,
leaving Constantinople, began his march at the head of his army toward
the emperor, Valens hastened from Antioch, and came to an engagement
with him near a city of Phrygia, called Nacolia. In the first encounter
he was defeated; but soon after he took Procopius alive, through the
treachery of Agilo and Gomarius, two of his generals, whom he subjected
to the most extraordinary punishments. <span
id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) The traitors he caused to be executed
by being sawn asunder, disregarding the oaths he had sworn to them. Two
trees standing near each other being forcibly bowed down, one of the
usurper’s legs was fastened to each of them, after which the trees being
suddenly permitted to recover their erect position, by their rise rent
the tyrant into two parts; and thus torn apart the usurper perished.

<span id="ii.vii.v-p4"></span>Ammianus Marcellinus, *Rerum Gestarum,*
XXVI. ix. 8–10, says that Florentius and Barchalba, after the fight at
Nacolia, delivered Procopius bound to Valens, and that Procopius was
immediately beheaded, and Florentius and Barchalba soon underwent the
same punishment. Philostorgius also (IX.) relates that Procopius was
beheaded, and that Florentius, who delivered him to Valens, was burnt.
