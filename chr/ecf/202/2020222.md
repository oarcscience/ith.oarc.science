<span id="ii.x.v-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—</span>*The Presbyter Sabbatius,
formerly a Jew, separates from the Novatians.*

<span id="ii.x.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.v-p2.1"></span>Many</span>, however, making no account of these
events yielded to their own depravity; for not only did the Jews
continue in unbelief after this miracle, but others also who love to
follow them were shown to hold views similar to theirs. Among these was
Sabbatius, of whom mention has before been made; <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) who not being content with the dignity
of presbyter to which he had attained, but aiming at a bishopric from
the beginning, separated himself from the church of the Novatians,
making a pretext of observing the Jewish Passover. <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) Holding therefore schismatic
assemblies apart from his own bishop Sisinnius, in a place named
Xerolophus, where the forum of Arcadius now is, he ventured on the
performance of an act deserving the severest punishments. Reading one
day at one of these meetings that passage in the Gospel where it is
said, <span id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) ‘Now it was the Feast of
the Jews called the Passover,’ he added what was never written nor heard
of before: ‘Cursed be he that celebrates the Passover out of the days of
unleavened bread.’ When these words were reported among the people, the
more simple of the Novatian laity, deceived by this artifice, flocked to
him. But his fraudulent fabrication was of no avail to him; for his
forgery issued in most disastrous consequences. For shortly afterwards
he kept this feast in anticipation of the Christian Easter; and many
according to their custom <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> <span
id="ii.x.v-Page_156"></span>flocked to him. While they were passing the
night in the accustomed vigils, a panic as if caused by evil spirits
fell upon them, as if Sisinnius their bishop were coming with a
multitude of persons to attack them. From the perturbation that might be
expected in such a case, and their being shut up at night in a confined
place, they trod upon one another, insomuch that above seventy of them
were crushed to death. On this account many deserted Sabbatius: some
however, holding his ignorant prejudice, remained with him. In what way
Sabbatius, by a violation of his oath, afterwards managed to get himself
ordained a bishop, we shall relate hereafter. <span
