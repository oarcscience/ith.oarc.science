<span id="ii.vii.xxxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII</span>.—*The Goths, under
the Reign of Valens, embrace Christianity.*

<span id="ii.vii.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>The</span> barbarians, dwelling beyond
the Danube, called the Goths, <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md)
having engaged in a civil war among themselves, were divided into two
parties, one of which was headed by Fritigernes, the other by Athanaric.
When the latter had obtained an evident advantage over his rival,
Fritigernes had recourse to the Romans, and implored their assistance
against his adversary. This was reported to the Emperor Valens, and he
ordered the troops which were garrisoned in Thrace to assist those
barbarians who had appealed to him against their more powerful
countrymen; and by means of this subsidy they won a complete victory
over Athanaric beyond the Danube, totally routing the enemy. This became
the occasion for the conversion of many of the barbarians to the
Christian religion: <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) for
Fritigernes, to express his sense of the obligation the emperor had
conferred upon him, embraced the religion of his benefactor, and urged
those who were under his authority to do the same. Therefore it is that
so many of the Goths are even to the present time infected with the
errors of Arianism, they having on the occasion preferred to become
adherents to that heresy on the emperor’s account. Ulfilas, their bishop
at that time, invented the Gothic letters, <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) and translating the Sacred Scriptures
into their own language, undertook to instruct these barbarians in the
Divine oracles. And as Ulfilas did not restrict his labors to the
subjects of Fritigernes, but extended them to those who acknowledged the
sway of Athanaric also, Athanaric regarding this as a violation of the
privileges of the religion of his ancestors, subjected those who
professed Christianity to severe punishments; so that many of the Arian
Goths of that period became martyrs. Arius indeed, failing in his
attempt to refute the opinion of Sabellius the Libyan, fell from the
true faith, and asserted the Son of God to be ‘a new God’: <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) but the barbarians embracing
Christianity with greater simplicity of mind despised the present life
for the faith of Christ. With these remarks we shall close our notice of
the Christianized Goths.

<span id="ii.vii.xxxiii-p3"></span>The fullest and best ancient authors
on the origin and history of the Goths are Procopius of Cæsarea
(*Historia*, IV.–VIII., *de Bello Italico adversus Gothos gesto*),
Jornandes (*de Getarum* \[*Gothorum*\] *origine et rebus gestis*), and
Isidore Hispalensis (*Historia Gothorum*). On the conversion of the
Goths to Christianity, see Neander, *Hist. of the Christ. Ch.* Vol. II.
p. 125–129, and Schaff, *Hist. of the Christ. Ch.* Vol. III. p. 640,
641.
