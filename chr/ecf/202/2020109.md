<span id="ii.vi.xi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*The Emperor Julian
extracts Money from the Christians.*

<span id="ii.vi.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.xi-p2.1"></span>Although</span> at the beginning of his reign
the Emperor Julian conducted himself mildly toward <span id="page_85">p.
85</span> <span id="ii.vi.xi-Page_85"></span>all men; but as he went on
he did not continue to show the same equanimity. He most readily indeed
acceded to the requests of the Christians, when they tended in any way
to cast odium on the memory of Constantius; but when this inducement did
not exist, he made no effort to conceal the rancorous feelings which he
entertained towards Christians in general. Accordingly he soon ordered
that the church of the Novatians at Cyzicus, which Euzoïus had totally
demolished, should be rebuilt, imposing a very heavy penalty upon
Eleusius bishop of that city, if he failed to complete that structure at
his own expense within the space of two months. Moreover, he favored the
pagan superstitions with the whole weight of his authority: and the
temples of the heathen were opened, as we have before stated; <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514) but he himself also publicly offered
sacrifices to Fortune, goddess of Constantinople, in the
cathedral, <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515) where her image was
erected.

the term, see Bennett, Christian Archæology, pp. 157–163. The special
basilica meant here was situated, according to Valesius, in the fourth
precinct, and alone called <span class="Greek"><span

qualification. The ‘Theodosian cathedral’ was situated in the seventh
ward.
