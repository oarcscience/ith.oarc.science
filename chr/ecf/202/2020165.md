<span id="ii.viii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.i-p3.1"></span>Before</span> we begin the fifth book of our
history, we must beg those who may peruse this treatise, not to censure
us too hastily because having set out to write a church history we still
intermingle with ecclesiastical matters, such an account of the wars
which took place during the period under consideration, as could be duly
authenticated. For this we have done for several reasons: first, in
order to lay before our readers an exact statement of facts; but
secondly, in order that the minds of the readers might not become
satiated with the repetition of the contentious disputes of bishops, and
their insidious designs against one another; but more especially that it
might be made apparent, that whenever the affairs of the state were
disturbed, those of the Church, as if by some vital sympathy, became
disordered also. <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) Indeed whoever
shall attentively examine the subject will find, that the mischiefs of
the state, and the troubles of the church have been inseparably
connected; for he will perceive that they have either arisen together,
or immediately succeeded one another. Sometimes the affairs of the
Church come first in order; then commotions in the state follow, and
sometimes the reverse, so that I cannot believe this invariable
interchange is merely fortuitous, but am persuaded that it proceeds from
our iniquities; and that these evils are inflicted upon us as merited
chastisements, if indeed as the apostle truly says, ‘Some men’s sins are
open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow
after.’ <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) For this reason we have
interwoven many affairs of the state with our ecclesiastical history. Of
the wars carried on during the reign of Constantine we have made no
mention, having found no account of them that could be depended upon
because of their iniquity: but of subsequent events, as much information
as we could gather from those still living <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) in the order of their occurrence, we
have passed in rapid review. We have continually included the emperors
in these historical details; because from the time they began to profess
the Christian religion, the affairs of the Church have depended on them,
so that even the greatest Synods have been, and still are convened by
their appointment. Finally, we have particularly noticed the Arian
heresy, because it has so greatly disquieted the churches. Let these
remarks be considered sufficient in the way of preface: we shall now
proceed with our history.

<span id="ii.viii.i-p4"></span>The views here expressed show a crude
conception of the vital relation between church and state. The very tone
of apology which tinges their expression is based on a misconception of
the idea of history. But Socrates was not below his age in this respect.
See Introd., p. xiii.
