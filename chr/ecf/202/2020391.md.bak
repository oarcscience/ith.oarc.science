<span id="iii.ix.xxix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*The Partisans of
Acacius again do not remain Quiet, but strive to abolish the Term
“Consubstantial,” and to confirm the Heresy of Arius*.

<span id="iii.ix.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxix-p2.1"></span>The</span> partisans of Acacius <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354.md) were not able to <span
id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="iii.ix.xxix-Page_324"></span>remain in tranquillity; and they
therefore assembled together with a few others in Antioch, and condemned
the decrees which they had themselves enacted. They decided to erase the
term “similar” from the formulary which had been read at Ariminum and at
Constantinople, and affirmed that in all respects, in substance and in
will, the Son is dissimilar from the Father, and that He proceeded from
what had no previous existence, even as Arius had taught from the
commencement. They were joined by the partisans of Aëtius, who had been
the first after Arius to venture openly upon the profession of these
opinions; hence Aëtius was called atheist, and his approvers, Anomians
and Exucontians.

<span id="iii.ix.xxix-p4"></span>When those who maintained the Nicene
doctrines demanded of the Acacians how they could say that the Son is
dissimilar from the Father, and that He proceeded out of nothing, when
it was affirmed in their own formulary that He is “God of God,” they
replied that the Apostle Paul had declared that “All things are of
God,” <span id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355.md) and that the Son is
included in the term “all things”; and that it was in this sense, and in
accordance with the Sacred Scriptures, that the expressions in their
formulary were to be understood. Such were the equivocations and
sophistry to which they had recourse. At length, finding that they could
advance no efficient argument to justify themselves in the opinion of
those who pressed them on this point, they withdrew from the assembly,
after the formulary of Constantinople had been read a second time, and
returned to their own cities.
