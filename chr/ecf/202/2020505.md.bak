<span id="iii.xiii.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*Sedition of the
People against Theophilus; and they traduced their Rulers. John was
recalled, and again came to the See*.

<span id="iii.xiii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> people of Constantinople were
made acquainted with the decree of the council towards the evening; and
they immediately rose up in sedition. <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) At the break of day they ran to the
church, and shouted, among many other plans, that a larger council ought
to be convened to take cognizance of the matter; and they prevented the
officers, who had been sent by the emperor to convey John into
banishment, from carrying the edict into execution. John, apprehensive
lest another accusation should be preferred against him, under the
pretext that he had disobeyed the mandate of the emperor, or excited an
insurrection among the people, when the multitude was dispersed,
secretly made his escape from the church at noon, three days after his
deposition. When the people became aware that he had gone into exile,
the sedition became serious, and many insulting speeches were uttered
against the emperor and the council; and particularly against Theophilus
and Severian, who were regarded as the originators of the plot. Severian
happened to be teaching in the church at the very time that these
occurrences were taking place; and he took occasion to commend the
deposition of John, and stated that, even supposing him guiltless of
other crimes, John deserved to be deposed on account of his pride;
because, while God willingly forgives men all other sins, he resists the
proud. At this <span id="page_411">p. 411</span> <span
id="iii.xiii.xviii-Page_411"></span>discourse the people became restive
under the wrong, and renewed their wrath, and fell into unrestrainable
revolt. They ran to the churches, to the market-places, and even to the
palace of the emperor, and with howls and groans demanded the recall of
John. The empress was at length overcome by their importunity; and she
persuaded her husband to yield to the wishes of the people. She quickly
sent a eunuch, named Briso, in whom she placed confidence, to bring back
John from Prenetus, a city of Bithynia; and protested that she had taken
no part in the machinations that had been carried on against him, but
had, on the contrary, always respected him as a priest and the initiator
of her children.

<span id="iii.xiii.xviii-p4"></span>When John, on his journey homeward,
reached the suburbs belonging to the empress, he stopped near Anaplus;
and refused to re-enter the city until the injustice of his deposition
had been recognized by a larger synod of bishops; but as this refusal
tended to augment the popular excitement, and led to many public
declamations against the emperor and the empress, he allowed himself to
be persuaded to enter the city. The people went to meet him, singing
psalms composed with reference to the circumstances; many carried light
wax tapers. They conducted him to the church; and although he refused,
and frequently affirmed that those who had condemned him ought first to
reconsider their vote, yet they compelled him to take the episcopal
throne, and to speak peace to the people according to the custom of the
priests. He then delivered an extemporaneous discourse, in which, by a
pleasing figure of speech, he declared that Theophilus had meditated an
injury against his church, even as the king of Egypt had contemplated
the violation of Sarah, the wife of the patriarch Abraham, which is
recorded in the books of the Hebrews: he then proceeded to commend the
zeal of the people, and to extol the emperor and the empress for their
good will to him; he stirred the people to much applause and good
acclaim for the emperor and his spouse, so that he had to leave his
speech half ended.
