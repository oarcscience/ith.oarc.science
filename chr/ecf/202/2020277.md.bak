<span id="iii.vi.i-p5"></span> ————————————

<span id="iii.vi.i-p6"></span><span class="c22"><span
id="iii.vi.i-p6.1"></span>Book I.</span>

<span id="iii.vi.i-p7"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.i-p7.1"></span>Chapter I.—</span>*The Preface of the Book, in
which he investigates the History of the Jewish Nation; Mention of those
who began such a Work; how and from what Sources he collected his
History; how he was intent upon the Truth, and what other Details the
History will contain.*

<span id="iii.vi.i-p8"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.i-p8.1"></span>My</span> mind has been often exercised in
inquiring how it is that other men are very ready to believe in God the
Word, while the Jews are so incredulous, although it was to them that
instruction concerning the things of God was, from the beginning,
imparted by the prophets, who likewise made them acquainted with the
events attendant upon the coming of Christ, before they came to
pass. <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) Besides, Abraham, the
founder of their nation and of the circumcision, was accounted worthy to
be an eye-witness, and the host of the Son of God. <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) And Isaac, his son, was honored as
the type of the sacrifice on the cross, for he was led bound to the
altar by his father and, as accurate students of the sacred Scriptures
affirm, the sufferings of Christ came to pass in like manner. Jacob
predicted that the expectation of the nations would be for Christ, as it
now is; and he likewise foretold the time in which he came, when he said
“the rulers of the Hebrews of the tribe of Judah, the tribal leader,
shall fail.” <span id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md)

<span id="iii.vi.i-p12"></span>This clearly referred to the reign of
Herod, who was an Idumean, on his father’s side, and on his mother’s, an
Arabian, and the Jewish nation was delivered to him by the Roman senate
and Augustus Cæsar. And of the rest of the prophets some declared
beforehand the birth of Christ, His ineffable conception, the mother
remaining a virgin after His birth, His people, and country. <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) Some predicted His divine and
marvelous deeds, while others foretold His sufferings, His resurrection
from the dead, His ascension into the heavens, and the event
accompanying each. But if any be ignorant of these facts it is not
difficult to know them by reading the sacred books. Josephus, the son of
Matthias, also who was a priest, and was most distinguished among Jews
and Romans, may be regarded as a noteworthy witness to the truth
concerning Christ <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) ; for he
hesitates to call Him a man since He wrought marvelous works, and was a
teacher of truthful doctrines, but openly calls him Christ; that He was
condemned to the death of the cross, and appeared alive again the third
day. Nor was Josephus ignorant of numberless other wonderful predictions
uttered beforehand by the holy prophets concerning Christ. He further
testifies that Christ brought over many to Himself both Greeks and Jews,
who continued to love Him, and that the people named after Him had not
become extinct. It appears to me that in narrating these things, he all
but proclaims that Christ, by comparison of works, is God. As if struck
by the miracle, he ran, somehow, a middle course, assailing in no way
those who believed in Jesus, but rather agreeing with them.

<span id="iii.vi.i-p15"></span>When I consider this matter it seems
reasonably remarkable to me, that the Hebrews did not anticipate, and,
before the rest of men, immediately turn to Christianity; for though the
Sibyl and some oracles announced beforehand the future of events
concerning Christ we are not on this <span id="page_240">p. 240</span>
<span id="iii.vi.i-Page_240"></span>account to attribute unbelief to all
the Greeks. For they were few, who, appearing superior in education,
could understand such prophecies, which were, for the most part, in
verse, and were declared with more recondite words to the people.
Therefore in my judgment, it was the result of the heavenly
preknowledge, for the sake of the agreement in future events, that the
coming facts were to be made known, not only by his own prophets, but in
part also by strangers. Just as a musician, under pressure of a strange
melody, may treat the superfluous tones of the chords lightly with his
plectrum, or add others to those already existing.

<span id="iii.vi.i-p16"></span>Having now shown that the Hebrews,
although in the possession of numerous and more distinct prophecies
concerning the coming of Christ, were less willing than the Greeks to
embrace the faith that is in Him, let what has been said on the subject
suffice. Yet let it by no means be hence accounted contrary to reason
that the church should have been mainly built up by the conversion of
other nations; for in the first place, it is evident that, in divine and
great affairs, God delights to bring to pass changes in a marvelous
manner; and then, be it remembered, it was by the exercise of no common
virtues that those who, at the very beginning, were at the head of
religious affairs, maintained their influence. If they did not, indeed,
possess a language sharpened for expression or for beauty of diction,
nor the power of convincing their hearers by means of phrases or
mathematical demonstrations, yet they did not the less accomplish the
work they had undertaken. They gave up their property, neglected their
kindred, were stretched upon a cross, and as if endowed with bodies not
their own, suffered many and excruciating tortures; neither seduced by
the adulation of the people and rulers of any city, nor terrified by
their menaces, they clearly evidenced by their conduct, that they were
supported in the struggle by the hope of a high reward. So that they, in
fact needed not to resort to verbal arguments; for without any effort on
their part, their very deeds constrained the inhabitants of every house
and of every city to give credit to their testimony, even before they
knew wherein it consisted.

<span id="iii.vi.i-p17"></span>Since then so divine and marvelous a
change has taken place in the circumstances of men, that ancient cults
and national laws have fallen into contempt; since many of the most
celebrated writers among the Greeks have tasked their powers of
eloquence in describing the Calydonian boar, the bull of Marathon and
other similar prodigies, which have really occurred in countries or
cities, or have a mystic origin, why should not I rise above myself, and
write a history of the Church? For I am persuaded that, as the topic is
not the achievements of men, it may appear almost incredible that such a
history should be written by me; but, with God, nothing is impossible.

<span id="iii.vi.i-p18"></span>I at first felt strongly inclined to
trace the course of events from the very commencement; but on reflecting
that similar records of the past up to their own time had been compiled
by those wisest of men, Clemens <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) and Hegesippus, successors of the
apostles, by Africanus the historian, and by Eusebius, surnamed
Pamphilus, <span id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) a man intimately
acquainted with the sacred Scriptures and the writings of the Greek
poets and historians, I merely draw up an epitome in two books of all
that is recorded to have happened to the churches, from the ascension of
Christ to the deposition of Licinius. <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) Now, however, by the help of God, I
will endeavor to relate the subsequent events as well.

<span id="iii.vi.i-p22"></span>I shall record the transactions with
which I have been connected, and also those concerning which I have
heard from persons who knew or saw the affairs in our own day or before
our own generation. But I have sought for records of events of earlier
date, amongst the established laws appertaining to religion, amongst the
proceedings of the synods of the period, amongst the innovations that
arose, and in the epistles of kings and priests. Some of these documents
are preserved in palaces and churches, and others are dispersed and in
the possession of the learned. I thought frequently of transcribing the
whole, but on further reflection I deemed it better, on account of the
mass of the documents, to give merely a brief synopsis of their
contents; yet whenever controverted topics are introduced, I will
readily transcribe freely from any work that may tend to the elucidation
of truth. If any one who is ignorant of past events should conclude my
history to be false, because he meets with conflicting statements in
other writings, let him know that since the dogmas of Arius and other
more recent hypotheses have been broached, the rulers of the churches,
differing in opinion among themselves, have transmitted in writing their
own peculiar views, for the benefit of their respective followers; and
further, be it remembered, these rulers convened councils and issued
what decrees they pleased, often condemning unheard those whose creed
was dissimilar to their own, and striving to their utmost to induce the
reigning prince and nobles of the time to side with them. Intent upon
maintaining the orthodoxy of their own dogmas, the partisans of each
sect respectively formed a <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="iii.vi.i-Page_241"></span>collection of such epistles as favored
their own heresy, omitting all documents of a contrary tendency. Such
are the obstacles by which we are beset in our endeavors to arrive at a
conclusion on this subject! Still, as it is requisite, in order to
maintain historical accuracy, to pay the strictest attention to the
means of eliciting truth, I felt myself bound to examine all writings of
this class according to my ability.

<span id="iii.vi.i-p23"></span>Let not an impertinent or malignant
spirit be imputed to me, for having dwelt upon the disputes of
ecclesiastics among themselves, concerning the primacy and the
pre-eminence of their own heresy. In the first place, as I have already
said, an historian ought to regard everything as secondary in importance
to truth; moreover, the doctrine of the Catholic Church is shown to be
especially the most genuine, since it has been tested frequently by the
plots of opposing thinkers; yet, the disposal of the lot being of God,
the Catholic Church has maintained its own ascendancy, has reassumed its
own power, and has led all the churches and the people to the reception
of its own truth.

<span id="iii.vi.i-p24"></span>I have had to deliberate whether I ought
to confine myself to the recital of events connected with the Church
under the Roman government; but it seemed more advisable to include, as
far as possible, the record of transactions relative to religion among
the Persians and barbarians. Nor is it foreign to ecclesiastical history
to introduce in this work an account of those who were the fathers and
originators of what is denominated monachism, and of their immediate
successors, whose celebrity is well known to us either by observation or
report. For I would neither be considered ungracious <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) towards them, nor willing to
consign their virtue to oblivion, nor yet be thought ignorant of their
history; but I would wish to leave behind me such a record of their
manner of life that others, led by their example, might attain to a
blessed and happy end. As the work proceeds, these subjects shall be
noted as far as possible.

<span id="iii.vi.i-p26"></span>Invoking the help and propitiousness of
God, I now proceed to the narration of events; the present history shall
have its beginning from this point.
