<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Concerning Melitius;
the Excellent Directions made by the Holy Council in his Complications*.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxiv-p2.1"></span>After</span> an investigation had been made
into the conduct of Melitius when in Egypt, the Synod sentenced him to
reside in Lycus, <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134.md) and to
retain only the name of bishop; and prohibited him from ordaining any
one either in a city or a village. Those who had previously been
ordained by him, were permitted by this law, to remain in communion and
in the ministry, but were to be accounted secondary in point of dignity
to the clergy in church and parish. <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135.md) When by death an appointment became
vacant, they were allowed to succeed to it, if deemed worthy, by the
vote of the multitude, but in this case, were to be ordained by the
bishop of the Church of Alexandria, for they were interdicted from
exercising any power or influence in elections. This regulation appeared
just to the Synod, <span id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span
id="iii.vi.xxiv-Page_257"></span>for Melitius <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) and his followers had manifested
great rashness and temerity in administering ordination; so that it also
deprived the ordinations which differed from those of Peter of all
consideration. He, when he conducted the Alexandrian Church, fled on
account of the persecution then raging, but afterwards suffered
martyrdom.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p3"></span>Lycus (Lycopolis) is not named in the
letter of the Synod which says simply that he should reside in his own
city. Soz. took the fact from Athan. *Apol. cont. Arian.* 71, where
Melitius, in the brief to Alexander, calls himself bishop of Lycus. This
is a proof of our historian’s use of the same documents to amplify the
statements of Socrates.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p5"></span>The best text reads Melitius, not
Meletius, so Athanas. and Soc.; usually the books write Meletius and
Meletians. We follow the reading.

its Members to Constantinople, and honoring them with Gifts, he exhorted
all to be of One Mind, and forwarded to Alexandria and every other place
the Decrees of the Holy Synod.](2020301.md)
