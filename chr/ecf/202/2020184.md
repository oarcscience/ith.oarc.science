<span id="ii.viii.xx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*Of the Office of
Penitentiary Presbyters and its Abolition.*

<span id="ii.viii.xx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xx-p2.1"></span>At</span> this time it was deemed requisite
to abolish the office of those presbyters in the churches who had charge
of the penitences: <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) this was done
on the following account. When the Novatians separated themselves from
the Church because they would not communicate with those who had lapsed
during the persecution under Decius, the bishops added to the
ecclesiastical canon <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) a presbyter
of penitence in order that those who had sinned after baptism might
confess their sins in the presence of the presbyter thus
appointed. <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) And this mode of
discipline is still maintained among other heretical institutions by all
the rest of the sects; the Homoousians only, together with the Novatians
who hold the same doctrinal views, have abandoned it. The latter indeed
would never admit of its establishment: <span
id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md) and the Homoousians who are now in
possession of the churches, after retaining this function for a
considerable period, abrogated it in the time of Nectarius, in
consequence of an event which occured in the Constantinopolitan church,
which is as follows: A woman of noble family coming to the penitentiary,
made a general confession of those sins she had committed since her
baptism: and the presbyter enjoined fasting and prayer continually, that
together with the acknowledgment of error, she might have to show works
also meet for repentance. Some time after this, the same lady again
presented herself, and confessed that she had been guilty of another
crime, a deacon of the church having slept with her. When this was
proved the deacon was ejected from the church: <span
id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) but the people were very indignant,
being not only offended at what had taken place, but also because the
deed had brought scandal and degradation upon the Church. When in
consequence of this, ecclesiastics were subjected to taunting and
reproach, Eudæmon a presbyter of the church, by birth an Alexandrian,
persuaded Nectarius the bishop to abolish the office of penitentiary
presbyter, and to leave every one to his own conscience with regard to
the participation of the sacred mysteries: <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) for thus only, in his judgment, could
the Church be preserved from obloquy. Having heard this explanation of
the matter from Eudæmon I have ventured to put in the present treatise:
for as I have often remarked, <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) I
have spared no pains to procure an authentic account of affairs from
those who were best acquainted with them, and to scrutinize every
report, lest I should advance what might be untrue. My observation to
Eudæmon, when he first related the circumstance, was this: ‘Whether, O
presbyter, your counsel has been profitable for the Church or otherwise,
God knows; but I see that it takes away the means of rebuking one
another’s faults, and prevents our acting upon that precept of the
apostle, <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) “Have no fellowship
with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.”’
Concerning this affair let this suffice.

<span id="ii.viii.xx-p8"></span>Although the plural is used here, the
reference is, no doubt, to the sacrament of the Lord’s supper only. The
mysteries recognized by Theodorus Studites, *Epist.* II. 165, are six;
i.e. baptism, eucharist, unction, orders, monastic tonsure, and the
mystery of death or funeral ceremonies. The Greek Church of modern times
enumerates seven: baptism, unction, eucharist, orders, penitence,
marriage, and extreme unction.

Valesius rightly infers from this answer of Socrates to Eudæmon that the
former was not a Novatian. For he disapproves of the abolition of the
penitentiary bishop’s office, whereas as a Novatian he would have been
against its institution before it was established, and in favor of its
abolition afterwards. The Novatians never admitted either of penitence
or of the penitentiary bishop.
