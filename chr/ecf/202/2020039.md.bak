<span id="ii.iv.xxx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*Athanasius is found
Innocent of what he was accused; his Accusers take to Flight.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxx-p2.1"></span>Matters</span> having been brought to this
issue with regard to Arsenius, the contrivers of this imposture were
reduced to perplexity; and Achab, <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) who was also called John, one of the
principal accusers, having slipped out of court in the tumult, effected
his escape. Thus Athanasius cleared himself from this charge, without
having recourse to any pleading; <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md)
for he was confident that the sight only of Arsenius alive would
confound his calumniators.

<span id="ii.iv.xxx-p3"></span>In Athanasius’ account (*Apol. c. Arian.*
65) this man’s name is given as <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxx-p3.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxx-p3.2"></span>Αρχαφ</span>(Archaph), which is an Egyptian
name; its assonance with the biblical <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxx-p3.3"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxx-p3.4"></span>Αχαάβ</span> may have made the latter a
current appellation. John was no doubt his monastic name.
