<span id="iii.vii.xx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Concerning Maximus, who
succeeded Macarius in the See of Jerusalem*.

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xx-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time Mark, <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) who had succeeded Silvester, and
who had held the episcopal sway during a short period, died, and Julius
was raised to the see of Rome. Maximus succeeded Macarius in the
bishopric of Jerusalem. <span id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md) It is
said that Macarius had ordained him bishop over the church of Diospolis,
but that the members of the church of Jerusalem insisted upon his
remaining among them. For since he was a confessor, and otherwise
excellent, he was secretly chosen beforehand in the approbation of the
people for their bishopric, after that Macarius should die. The dread of
offending the people and exciting an insurrection led to the election of
another bishop over Diospolis, and Maximus remained in Jerusalem, and
exercised the priestly functions conjointly with Macarius; and after the
death of this latter, he governed that church. It is, however, well
known to those who are accurately acquainted with these circumstances,
that Macarius concurred with the people in their desire to retain
Maximus; for it is said that he regretted the ordination of Maximus, and
thought that he ought necessarily to have been reserved for his own
succession on account of his holding right views concerning God and his
confession, which had so endeared him to the people. He likewise feared
that, at his death, the adherents of Eusebius and Patrophilus, who had
embraced Arianism, would take that opportunity to place one of their own
views in his see; for even while Macarius was living, they had attempted
to introduce some innovations, but since they were to be separated from
him, they on this account kept quiet.

<span id="iii.vii.xx-p3"></span>Marcus is not mentioned by Soc. or
Theodoret, only by the Latins. The order is correct, whereas in i. 17
Julius is mistakenly made to do duty for Silvester.
