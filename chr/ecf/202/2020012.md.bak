<span id="ii.iv.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*While Constantine favors
the Christians, Licinius, his Colleague, persecutes them.*

<span id="ii.iv.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>Now</span> Constantine, the emperor, having
thus embraced Christianity, conducted himself as a Christian of his
profession, rebuilding the churches, and enriching them with splendid
offerings: he also either closed or destroyed the temples of the
pagans, <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) and exposed the images
which were in them to popular contempt. But his colleague Licinius,
holding his pagan tenets, hated Christians; and although from fear of
the emperor Constantine he avoided exciting open persecution, yet he
managed to plot against them covertly, and at length proceeded to harass
them without disguise. This persecution, however, was local, extending
only to those districts where Licinius himself was: but as these and
other public outrages did not long remain concealed from Constantine,
finding out that the latter was indignant at his conduct, Licinius had
recourse to an apology. Having thus propitiated him, he entered into a
feigned league of friendship, pledging himself by many oaths not to act
again tyrannically. But no sooner did he pledge himself than he
committed perjury; for he neither changed his tyrannical mood nor ceased
persecuting Christians. Indeed, he even prohibited the bishops by law
from visiting the uncoverted pagans, lest it should be made a pretext
for proselyting them to the Christian faith. And the persecution was
thus at the same time well known and secret. It was conceded in name but
manifest in fact; for those who were exposed to his persecution suffered
most severely both in their persons and property.

id="ii.iv.iii-p3.2"></span>Ελλήνων</span>: the word is used without the
sense of nationality. So also in the New Testament often: [Mark

2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#003.md), [Gal.
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md)<span id="ii.iv.iii-p3.3"></span>,
where the Syriac (Peschitto) version renders, more according to sense
than according to the letter, ‘an Aramæan.’
