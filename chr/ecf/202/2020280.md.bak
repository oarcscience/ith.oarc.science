<span id="iii.vi.iv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Constantine commands the
Sign of the Cross to be carried before him in Battle; an Extraordinary
Narrative about the Bearers of the Sign of the Cross.*

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor, amazed at the prophecies
concerning Christ which were expounded to him by the priests, sent for
some skillful artisans, and commanded them to remodel the standard
called by the Romans *Labarum*, <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) to convert it into a representation
of the cross, and to adorn it with gold and precious stones. This
warlike trophy was valued beyond all others; for it was always wont to
be carried before the emperor, and was worshiped by the soldiery. I
think that Constantine changed the most honorable symbol of the Roman
power into the sign of Christ, chiefly that by the habit of having it
always in view, and of worshiping it, the soldiers might be induced to
abandon their ancient forms of superstition, and to recognize the true
God, whom the emperor worshiped, as their leader and their help in
battle; for this symbol was always borne in front of his own troops, and
was, at the command of the emperor, carried among the phalanxes in the
thickest of the fight by an illustrious band of spearmen, of whom each
one in turn took the standard upon his shoulders, and paraded it through
the ranks. It is said that on one occasion, on an unexpected movement of
the hostile forces, the man who held the standard in terror, placed it
in the hands of another, and secretly fled from the battle. When he got
beyond the reach of the enemy’s weapons, he suddenly received a wound
and fell, while the man who had stood by the divine symbol remained
unhurt, although many weapons were aimed at him; for the missiles of the
enemy, marvelously directed by divine agency, lighted upon the standard,
and the bearer thereof, although in the midst of danger, was preserved.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p4"></span>It is also asserted that no soldier who
bore this standard in battle ever fell, through any dark calamity, such
as is wont to happen to the soldiery in war, or was wounded, or taken
prisoner.
