<span id="ii.vii.xxvii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*Of Gregory
Thaumaturgus (the Wonder-Worker).*

<span id="ii.vii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>But</span> since from the likeness of the
name, and the title of the books attributed to Gregory, <span
id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xxvii-Page_112"></span>persons are liable to confound very
different parties, it is important to notice that Gregory of Pontus is a
different person. He was a native of Neocæsarea in Pontus, of greater
antiquity than the one above referred to, inasmuch as he was a disciple
of Origen. <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646) This Gregory’s fame
was celebrated at Athens, at Berytus, throughout the entire diocese of
Pontus, and I might almost add in the whole world. When he had finished
his education in the schools of Athens, he went to Berytus to study
civil law, where hearing that Origen expounded the Holy Scriptures at
Cæsarea, he quickly proceeded thither; and after his understanding had
been opened to perceive the grandeur of these Divine books, bidding
adieu to all further cultivation of the Roman laws, he became
thenceforth inseparable from Origen, from whom having acquired a
knowledge of the true philosophy, he was recalled soon after by his
parents and returned to his own country; and there, while still a
layman, he performed many miracles, healing the sick, and casting out
devils even by his letters, insomuch that the pagans were no less
attracted to the faith by his acts, than by his discourses. Pamphilus
Martyr mentions this person in the books which he wrote in defence of
Origen; to which there is added a commendatory oration of Gregory’s,
composed in praise of Origen, when he was under the necessity of leaving
him. There were then, to be brief, several Gregories: the first and most
ancient was the disciple of Origen; the second was the bishop of
Nazianzus; the third was Basil’s brother; and there was another
Gregory <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647) whom the Arians
constituted bishop during the exile of Athanasius. But enough has been
said respecting them.
