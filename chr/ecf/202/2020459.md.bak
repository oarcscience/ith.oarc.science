<span id="iii.xii.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Gratian elects
Theodosius of Spain to reign with him, Arianism prevails throughout the
Eastern Churches except that of Jerusalem. Council of Antioch. The
Settlement of the Presidency of the Churches*.

<span id="iii.xii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.ii-p2.1"></span>On</span> reflecting that, while it was
indispensably requisite to check the incursions of the barbarians of the
Ister in Illyria and Thrace, his presence was equally necessary in Gaul
to repel the inroads of the Alemanni, Gratian associated
Theodosius <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) with himself at
Sirmich, in the government of the empire. Theodosius belonged to an
illustrious family of the Pyrenees in Iberia, and had acquired so much
renown in war, that before he was raised to the imperial power, he was
universally considered capable of guiding the reins of the empire.

<span id="iii.xii.ii-p4"></span>At this period all the churches of the
East, with the exception of that of Jerusalem, were in the hands of the
Arians. The Macedonians differed but little in opinion from those who
maintained the doctrine of Nicæa, and held intercourse and communion
with them in all the cities; and this had been more especially the case
with the Macedonians of Constantinople, ever since their reconciliation
with Liberius. But after the enactment of Gratian’s law, some bishops of
the Macedonian heresy took courage and repossessed the churches from
which they had been ejected by Valens. They assembled together at
Antioch in Caria, and protested that the Son is not to be declared
“consubstantial” with the Father, but only like unto Him in substance.
From that period, many of the Macedonians seceded from the others, and
held separate churches; while others, condemning this opposition and
contentiousness of those who had made these decisions, united themselves
still more firmly with the followers of the Nicene doctrines.

<span id="iii.xii.ii-p5"></span>Many of the bishops who had been
banished by Valens, and who were recalled about this period in
consequence of the law of Gratian, manifested no ambition to be restored
to the highest offices of the Church; but they preferred the unity of
the people, and therefore begged the Arian bishops to retain the posts
they occupied, and not to rend by dissension the Church, which had been
transmitted by God and the apostles as one, but which contentiousness
and ambition for precedence had divided into many parts. Eulalius,
bishop of Amasia in Pontus, was one of those who pursued this course of
conduct. It is said that when he returned from exile, he found that his
church was presided over by an Arian bishop, and that scarcely fifty
inhabitants of the city had submitted to the control of this new bishop.
Eulalius, desiring unity above all other considerations, offered to take
part with the Arian bishop in the government of the church, and
expressly agreed to allow him the precedence. But as the Arian would not
comply with this proposition, it was not long before he found himself
deserted by the few who had followed him, and who went over to the other
party.
