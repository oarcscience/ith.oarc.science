<span id="iii.xi.xxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*At that Time, the
Doctrine of the Holy Ghost was agitated, and it was decided that he is
to be considered Consubstantial with the Father and the Son*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxii-p2.1"></span>A question</span> was renewed at this
juncture which had previously excited much inquiry and now more; namely,
whether the Holy Ghost is or is not to be considered consubstantial with
the Father and the Son. <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466)

<span id="iii.xi.xxii-p4"></span>Many contentions and debates ensued on
this subject, similar to those which had been held concerning the nature
of God the Word. Those who asserted that the Son is dissimilar from the
Father, and those who insisted that He is similar in substance to the
Father, came to one common opinion concerning the Holy Ghost; for both
parties maintained that the Holy Ghost differs in substance, and that He
is but the Minister and the third in point of order, honor, and
substance. Those, on the contrary, who believed that the Son is
consubstantial with the Father, held also the same view about the
Spirit. This doctrine was nobly maintained in Syria by Apolinarius,
bishop of Laodicea; in Egypt by Athanasius, <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467) the bishop; and in Cappadocia and
in the churches of Pontus by Basil <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) and Gregory. <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469) The bishop of Rome, on learning
that this question was agitated with great acrimony, and that it of
course was augmented daily by controversies, wrote to the churches of
the East and urged them to receive the doctrine upheld by the Western
clergy; namely, that the three Persons of the Trinity are of the same
substance and of equal dignity. The question having been thus decided by
the Roman churches, peace was restored, and the inquiry appeared to have
an end.
