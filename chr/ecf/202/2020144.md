id="ii.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—</span>*Slaughter of Many
Persons by Valens an Account of their Names, in Consequence of a Heathen
Prediction.* <span id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md)

<span id="ii.vii.xix-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xix-p3.1"></span>The</span> cruel disposition of the emperor
was at this time abused by an execrable demon, who induced certain
curious persons to institute an inquiry by means of necromancy as to who
should succeed Valens on the throne. To their magical incantations the
demon gave responses not distinct and unequivocal, but as the general
practice is, full of ambiguity; for displaying the four letters <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.vii.xix-p3.2"></span>q, e, o, and d</span>,
he declared that the name of the successor of Valens began with these;
and that it was a compound name. When the emperor was apprised of this
oracle, instead of committing to God, who alone can penetrate futurity,
the decision of this matter, in contravention of those Christian
principles to which he pretended the most zealous adherence, he put to
death very many persons of whom he had the suspicion that they aimed at
the sovereign power: thus such as were named ‘Theodore,’ ‘Theodotus,’
‘Theodosius,’ ‘Theodulus,’ and the like, were sacrificed to the
emperor’s fears; and among the rest was Theodosiolus, a very brave man,
descended from a noble family in Spain. Many persons therefore, to avoid
the danger to which they were exposed, changed their names, giving up
those which they had received from their parents in infancy as
dangerous. This will be enough on that subject.
