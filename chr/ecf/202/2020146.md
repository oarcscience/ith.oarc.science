<span id="ii.vii.xxi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*The Arians are allowed
by the Emperor to imprison Peter and to set Lucius over the See of
Alexandria.*

<span id="ii.vii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Upon</span> this the Arians, emboldened by
their knowledge of the emperor’s religious sentiments, again took
courage, and without delay informed him of the circumstance. He was then
residing at Antioch. Then indeed Euzoïus who presided over the Arians of
that city, eagerly embracing the favorable opportunity thus presented,
begged permission to go to Alexandria, for the purpose of putting Lucius
the Arian in possession of the churches there. The emperor acceded to
this request, and as speedily as possible Euzoïus proceeded forthwith to
Alexandria, attended by the imperial troops. Magnus, also, the emperor’s
treasurer, went with him. Moreover an imperial mandate had been issued
to Palladius, the governor of Egypt, enjoining him to aid them with a
military force. Wherefore having apprehended Peter, they cast him into
prison; and after dispersing the rest of the clergy, they placed Lucius
in the episcopal chair.
