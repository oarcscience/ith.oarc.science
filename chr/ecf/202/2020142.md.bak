id="ii.vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*The Emperor Valens,
while at Antioch, again persecutes the Adherents of the ‘Homoousion.’*

<span id="ii.vii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Emperor Valens, little affected
by the calamities resulting from the famine, went to Antioch in Syria,
and during his residence there cruelly persecuted such as would not
embrace Arianism. For not content with ejecting out of almost all the
churches of the East those who maintained the ‘homoousian’ opinion, he
inflicted on them various punishments besides. He destroyed a greater
number even than before, delivering them up to many different kinds of
death, but especially drowning in the river.
