<span id="ii.ix.v-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Of Serapion the Deacon on
whose Account John becomes Odious to his Clergy.*

<span id="ii.ix.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.v-p2.1"></span>Being</span> such in disposition and manners,
and promoted to the episcopacy, John was led to conduct himself toward
his clergy with more than proper superciliousness, designing to correct
the morals of the clergy under him. Having thus chafed the temper of the
ecclesiastics, he was disliked by them; and so many of them stood aloof
from him as a passionate man, and others became his bitter enemies.
Serapion, a deacon of his retinue, led him to alienate their minds still
more from him; and once in presence of the whole assembled clergy he
cried out with a loud voice to the bishop—‘You will never be able to
govern these men, my lord, unless you drive them all with a rod.’ This
speech of his excited a general feeling of animosity against the bishop;
the bishop also not long after expelled many of them from the church,
some for one cause, and some for another. And, as it usually happens
when persons in office adopt such violent measures, those who were thus
expelled by him formed combinations and inveighed against him to the
people. What contributed greatly to gain credence for these complaints
was the fact that the bishop was not willing to eat with any one else,
and never accepted an invitation to a <span id="page_140">p. 140</span>
<span id="ii.ix.v-Page_140"></span>feast. On account of this the plot
against him became widespread. His reasons for not eating with others no
one knew with any certainty, <span id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) but
some persons in justification of his conduct state that he had a very
delicate stomach, and weak digestion, which obliged him to be careful in
his diet, and therefore he ate alone; while others thought this was due
to his rigid and habitual abstinence. Whatever the real motive may have
been, the circumstance itself contributed not a little to the grounds of
accusation by his calumniators. The people nevertheless continued to
regard him with love and veneration, on account of his valuable
discourses in the church, and therefore those who sought to traduce him,
only brought themselves into contempt. How eloquent, convincing, and
persuasive his sermons were, both those which were published by himself,
and such as were noted down by short-hand writers as he delivered them,
why should we stay to declare? Those who desire to form an adequate idea
of them, must read for themselves, and will thereby derive both pleasure
and profit.

<span id="ii.ix.v-p3"></span>These reasons are given by Palladius as
follows: ‘He was accustomed to eat alone, as I partially know, for these
reasons: first, he drank no wine…secondly, his stomach was, on account
of certain infirmities, irregular, so that often the food prepared for
him was repugnant, and other food not put before him was desired. Again
he at times neglected to eat, lengthening out his meal until evening,
sometimes being absorbed in ecclesiastical cares and sometimes in
contemplation;…but it is a custom with table companions if we do not
relish the same articles of food which they do, or laugh at
insignificant witticisms…to make this an occasion of ill-speech.’
Palladius, *de Vita S. Joannis,* 12.
