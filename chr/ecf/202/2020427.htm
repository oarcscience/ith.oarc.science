<p class="c25"><a name="iii.xi.xi-p4"></A>&#8220;On account of the mad opinions of the heretics who do not cease to keep on sowing scandals for the Catholic churches, we who nul<A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A> <a name="iii.xi.xi-Page_353"></A>lify their every attack confess the Synod which was held at Lampsacus, the one at Smyrna and the councils held in other places, by the orthodox bishops. We have furnished letters and sent on an embassy to your Goodness, as likewise to all the other bishops of Italy and of the West, to confirm and preserve the Catholic faith, which was established at the holy council of Nic&aelig;a, by the blessed Constantine and three hundred and eighteen God-fearing fathers.</p>  
<p class="c25"><a name="iii.xi.xi-p5"></A>&#8220;This remains, by an unmixed and immovable settlement, until now, and will remain perpetually; in which the term &#145;consubstantial&#146; is fixed in all holiness and piety in testimony against the perverseness of Arius. We confess, each with his own hand, that we with the aforesaid have always held this same faith, that we still hold it, and that we shall adhere to it to the last. We condemn Arius, his impious dogmas, and his disciples. We also condemn the heresies of Patropasianus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1447"></A><A HREF="#fn_1447"><FONT SIZE="1">1448</FONT></A>
  of Photinus, of Marcellus, of Paul of Samosata, and all who maintain such doctrines themselves. We anathematize all heresies opposed to the aforesaid faith established by the saintly fathers at Nic&aelig;a. We anathematize Arius especially, and condemn all such decrees as were enacted at Ariminum, in opposition to the aforesaid faith established by the holy council of Nic&aelig;a. We were formerly deluded by the guile and perjury of certain parties, and subscribed to these decrees when they were transmitted to Constantinople from Nic&aelig;a, a city of Thrace.&#8221; </p>   
<p class="c25"><a name="iii.xi.xi-p7"></A>After this confession they subjoined a copy of the entire formulary of Nic&aelig;a to their own creed, and, having received from Liberius a written account of all that they had transacted, they sailed to Sicily.</p>
