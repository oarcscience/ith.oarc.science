<span id="ii.v.xiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Paul is again ejected
from the Church by Constantius, in consequence of the Slaughter of
Hermogenes, his General.*

<span id="ii.v.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xiii-p2.1"></span>Intelligence</span> of these proceedings
reached the ears of the Emperor Constantius, whose residence was then at
Antioch. Accordingly he ordered his general Hermogenes, who had been
despatched to Thrace, to pass through Constantinople on his way, and
expel Paul from the church. He, on arriving at Constantinople, threw the
whole city into confusion, attempting to cast out the bishops; for
sedition immediately arose from the people in their eagerness to defend
the bishop. And when Hermogenes persisted in his efforts to drive out
Paul by means of his military force, the people became exasperated as is
usual in such cases; and making a desperate attack upon him, they set
his house on fire, and after dragging through the city, they at last put
him to death. This took place in the consulate <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) of the two Augusti,—that is to say,
the third consulship,—Constantius, and the second of Constans: at which
time Constans, having subdued the Franks, compelled them to enter into a
treaty of peace with the Romans. The Emperor Constantius, on being
informed of the assassination of Hermogenes, set off on horseback from
Antioch, and arriving at Constantinople immediately expelled Paul, and
then punished the inhabitants by withdrawing from them more than 40,000
measures of the daily allowance of wheat which had been granted by his
father for gratuitous distribution among them: for prior to this
catastrophe, nearly 80,000 measures of wheat brought from Alexandria had
been bestowed on the citizens. <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md)
He hesitated, however, to ratify <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md)
the appointment of Macedonius to the bishopric of that city, being
irritated against him not only because he had been ordained without his
own consent; but also because on account of the contests in which he had
been engaged with Paul, Hermogenes, his general, and many other persons
had been slain. But having given him permission to minister in the
church in which he had been consecrated, he returned to Antioch.

was evidently recorded in that portion of Am. Marcellinus’ work which
has been lost; at least a record of it is referred to in that author’s
*Rerum Gestarum,* XIV. x. 2 (ed. Eyssenhart).
