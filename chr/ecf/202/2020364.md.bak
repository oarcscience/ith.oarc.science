<span id="iii.ix.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Constantius again ejects
Athanasius, and banishes those who represented the Homoousian Doctrine.
Death of Paul, Bishop of Constantinople. Macedonius: his Second
Usurpation of the See, and his Evil Deeds*.

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor, <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md) deceived by the calumnies of the
heterodox, changed his mind, and, in opposition to the decrees of the
council of Sardica, exiled the bishops whom he had previously restored.
Marcellus was again deposed, and Basil re-acquired possession of the
bishopric of Ancyra. Lucius was thrown into prison, and died there. Paul
was condemned to perpetual banishment, and was conveyed to Cucusum, in
Armenia, where he died. I have never, however, been able to ascertain
whether or not he died a natural death. It is still reported, that he
was strangled by the adherents of Macedonius. <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) As soon as he was sent into exile,
Macedonius seized the government of his church; and, being aided by
several orders of monks whom he had incorporated at Constantinople, and
by alliances with many of the neighboring bishops, he commenced, it is
said, a persecution against those who held the sentiments of Paul. He
ejected them, in the first place, from the church, and then compelled
them to enter into communion with himself. Many perished from wounds
received in the struggle; some were deprived of their possessions; some,
of the rights of citizenship; and others were branded on the forehead
with an iron instrument, in order that they might be stamped as
infamous. The emperor was displeased when he heard of these
transactions, and imputed the blame of them to Macedonius and his
adherents.
