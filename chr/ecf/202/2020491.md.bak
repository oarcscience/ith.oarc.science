<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Enterprise of Gaïnas,
the Gothic Barbarian. Evils which he perpetrated*.

<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.iv-p2.1"></span>A barbarian</span>, named Gaïnas, <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) who had taken refuge among the
Romans, and who had risen from the lowest ranks of the army to military
command, formed a design to usurp the throne of the Roman Empire. With
this in view, he sent for his countrymen, the Goths, from their own
homes to come to the Roman territories, and appointed his relatives to
be tribunes and chiliarchs. Tirbingilus, a relative of his, who
commanded a large body of troops in Phrygia, commenced an insurrection;
and to all persons of judgment it was patent that he was preparing the
way. Under the pretext of resenting the devastation of many of the
Phrygian cities, which had been committed to his superintendence, Gaïnas
turned to their assistance; but on his arrival, when a multitude of
barbarians had been equipped for war, he disclosed his plan which he had
previously concealed, and pillaged the cities which he had been
commanded to guard, and was about to attack others. He then proceeded to
Bithynia, and encamped in the boundaries of Chalcedon, and threatened
war. The cities of the East of Asia, and as many as lived between these
regions and about the Euxine, being thus in danger, the emperor and his
counsellors judged that it would not be safe to venture into any
hazardous undertaking without preparation against men who were already
desperate; for the emperor declared that he was ready to be favorable to
him in every point, and sent to Gaïnas to offer him whatever he might
demand.

<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p4"></span>Gaïnas requested that two consuls,
named Saturninus and Aurelian, whom he suspected of being inimical,
should be delivered up to him; and when they were in his power, he
pardoned them. He afterwards held a conference with the emperor near
Chalcedon, in the house of prayer in which the tomb of Euphemia the
martyr is deposited; and after he and the emperor had mutually bound
themselves by vows of friendship to each other, he threw down his arms,
and repaired to Constantinople, where, by an imperial edict, he was
appointed general of the infantry and cavalry. Prosperity so far beyond
his deserts was more than he could bear with moderation; and as,
contrary to all expectations, he had succeeded so wonderfully in his
former enterprise, he determined to undermine the peace of the Catholic
Church. He was a Christian, and, like the rest of the barbarians, had
espoused the Arian heresy. Urged either by the presidents of this party,
or by the suggestions of his own ambition, he applied to the emperor to
place one of the churches of the city in the hands of the Arians. He
represented that it was neither just nor proper that, while he was
general of the Roman troops, he should be compelled to retire without
the walls of the city when he wished to engage in prayer. John did not
remain inactive when made acquainted with these proceedings. He
assembled all the bishops who were then residing in the city, and went
with them to the palace. He spoke at great length in the presence of the
emperor and of Gaïnas, reproached the latter with being a stranger and a
fugitive, and reminded him that his life had been saved by the father of
the emperor, to whom he had sworn fidelity, as likewise to his children,
to the Romans, and to the laws which he was striving to make powerless.
When he had made this speech he showed the law which Theodosius had
established, forbidding the heterodox to hold a church within the walls.
Then, addressing himself to the emperor, John exhorted him to maintain
the laws which had been established against heretics; and told him that
it would be better to be deprived of the empire, than to be guilty of
impiety by becoming a traitor to the house of God. Thus did John speak
boldly like a man, and gave no place to innovation in the churches under
his care. Gaïnas, however, regardless of his oaths, attacked the city.
His enterprise was pre-announced by the appearance of a comet directly
over the city; this comet was of extraordinary magnitude, larger, it is
said, than any that had previously been seen, and reaching almost to the
earth itself. Gaïnas intended to seize first upon the stores of the
bankers, and hoped to collect together their enormous wealth. But since
the rumor of his plan was spread, the bankers concealed their ready
wealth and no longer set forth silver upon the tables, as they were wont
publicly to do. Gaïnas then sent some of the barbarians by <span
id="page_402">p. 402</span> <span id="iii.xiii.iv-Page_402"></span>night
to set fire to the palace; but they were unskillful and overcome with
fear, so they turned back. For when they drew near the edifice, they
fancied that they saw a multitude of heavily armed men of immense
stature, and they returned to inform Gaïnas that fresh troops had just
arrived. Gaïnas disbelieved their report, for he was confident that no
troops had entered the city. As, however, other individuals whom he
despatched to the palace for the same purpose, on the following night,
returned with the same report, he went out himself to be an eye-witness
of the extraordinary spectacle. Imagining that the army before him
consisted of soldiers who had been withdrawn from other cities, and that
these troops protected the city and palace by night and concealed
themselves by day, Gaïnas feigned to be possessed of a demon; and under
the pretext of offering up a prayer, went to the church which the father
of the emperor had erected in honor of John the Baptist, at Hebdomos.
Some of the barbarians remained in Constantinople, and others
accompanied Gaïnas; they secretly carried arms and pots full of darts in
the women’s chariots, but when they were discovered, they slew the guard
at the gates, who attempted to hinder the carrying out of the arms. From
this the city was filled with as much confusion and uproar, as if it had
suddenly been captured. A good thought ruled this terrible moment; for
the emperor without delay declared Gaïnas a public enemy, and commanded
that all the barbarians left in the city should be slain. No sooner was
this mandate issued, than the soldiers rushed upon the barbarians, and
slew the greater number of them; they then set fire to the church which
was named after the Goths; for as was customary, they had congregated
there in the house of prayer, because there was no other refuge, since
the gates were shut. On hearing of this calamity, Gaïnas passed through
Thrace, and proceeded towards the Cherronesus, intending to cross the
Hellespont; for he thought that if he could conquer the opposite coast
of Asia, he could easily subjugate to himself all the provinces of the
empire in the East. All these things proved contrary to his hopes,
because the Romans were there favored by Divine power. For the army sent
by the emperor was on hand by land and by sea, under the command of
Flavita, who although a barbarian by birth, was a good man, and an able
general. The barbarians, having no ships, imprudently attempted to cross
the Hellespont to the opposite continent on rafts; when suddenly a great
wind blew and violently separated them, and drove them against the Roman
vessels. The greater part of the barbarians and their horses were
drowned; but many were slain by the military. Gaïnas, however, with a
few of his followers escaped; but not long after, when fleeing through
Thrace, they fell in with another detachment of the Roman army, and
Gaïnas, with all his barbarians, perished. Such was the termination of
the daring schemes and life of Gaïnas.

<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p5"></span>Flavita had rendered himself very
conspicuous in this war, and was therefore appointed consul. <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) During his consulate, and that of
Vincentius, a son was born to the emperor. The young prince was named
after his grandfather, and at the commencement of the next
consulate, <span id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) was proclaimed
Augustus.
