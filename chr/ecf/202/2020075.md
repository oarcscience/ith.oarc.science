<span id="ii.v.xxv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Of the Usurpers
Magnentius and Vetranio.*

<span id="ii.v.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxv-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time an extraordinary
commotion shook the whole state, of the principal heads, of which we
shall give a brief account, deeming it necessary not to pass over them
altogether. We mentioned in our first book, <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338) that after the death of the founder of
Constantinople, his three sons succeeded him in the empire: it must now
be also stated, that a kinsman of theirs, Dalmatius, so named from his
father, shared with them the imperial authority. This person after being
associated with them in the sovereignty for a very little while, the
soldiers put to death, <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339)
Constantius having neither commanded his destruction, nor forbidden it.
The manner in which Constantine the younger was also killed by the
soldiers, on his invading that division of the empire which belonged to
his brother, has already been recorded <span
id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340) more than once. After his death, the
Persian war was raised against the Romans, in which Constantius did
nothing prosperously: for in a battle fought by night on the frontiers
of both parties, the Persians had to some slight extent the advantage.
And this at a time when the affairs of the Christians became no less
unsettled, there being great disturbance throughout the churches on
account of Athanasius, and the term *homoousion.* Affairs having reached
this pass, there sprang up a tyrant in the western parts called
Magnentius, <span id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341) who by treachery
slew Constans, the emperor of the western division of the empire, at
that time residing in the Gauls. This being done, a furious civil war
arose, and Magnentius made himself master of all Italy, reduced Africa
and Libya under his power, and even obtained possession of the Gauls.
But at the city of Sirmium in Illyricum, the military set up another
tyrant whose name was Vetranio; <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342)
while a fresh trouble threw Rome itself into commotion. For there was a
nephew of Constantine’s, Nepotian by name, who, supported by a body of
gladiators, there assumed the sovereignty. He was, however, slain by
some of the officers of Magnentius, who himself invaded the western
provinces, and spread desolation in every direction.
