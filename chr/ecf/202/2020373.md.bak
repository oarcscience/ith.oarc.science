<span id="iii.ix.xi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*Liberius, Bishop of Rome,
and the cause of his being exiled by Constantius. Felix his Successor*.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xi-p2.1"></span>Although</span> what I have recorded did not
occur to Athanasius and the church of Alexandria, at the same period of
time after the death of Constans, yet I deemed it right, for the sake of
greater clearness, to relate all these events collectively. The council
of Milan <span id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) was dissolved
without any business having been transacted, and the emperor condemned
to banishment all those who had opposed the designs of the enemies of
Athanasius. As Constantius <span id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span
id="iii.ix.xi-Page_307"></span>wished to establish uniformity of
doctrine throughout the Church, and to unite the priesthood in the
maintenance of the same sentiments, he formed a plan to convene the
bishops of every religion to a council, to be held in the West. He was
aware of the difficulty of carrying this scheme into execution, arising
from the vast extent of land and seas which some of the bishops would
have to traverse, yet he did not altogether despair of success. While
this project was occupying his mind, and before he prepared to make his
triumphal entrance into Rome, he sent for Liberius, the bishop of Rome,
and strove to persuade him to conformity of sentiment with the priests
by whom he was attended, amongst whom was Eudoxius. As Liberius,
however, refused compliance, and protested that he would never yield on
this point, the emperor banished him to Berœa, in Thrace. It is alleged,
that another pretext for the banishment of Liberius was, that he would
not withdraw from communion with Athanasius, but manfully opposed the
emperor, who insisted that Athanasius had injured the Church, had
occasioned the death of the elder of his two brothers, <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) and had sown the seeds of enmity
between Constans and himself. As the emperor revived all the decrees
which had been enacted against Athanasius by various councils, and
particularly by that of Tyre, Liberius told him that no regard ought to
be paid to edicts which were issued from motives of hatred, of favor, or
of fear. He desired that the bishops of every region should be made to
sign the formulary of faith compiled at Nicæa, and that those bishops
who had been exiled on account of their adherence to it should be
recalled. He suggested that after these matters were righted all the
bishops should, at their own expense, and without being furnished either
with public conveyances or money, so as not to seem burdensome and
destructive, proceed to Alexandria, and make an accurate test of the
truth, which could be more easily instituted at that city than
elsewhere, as the injured and those who had inflicted injury as well as
the confuters of the charges dwelt there. He then exhibited the letter
written by Valens and Ursacius to Julius, his predecessor in the Roman
see, in which they solicited his forgiveness, and acknowledged that the
depositions brought against Athanasius, at the Mareotis, were false; and
he besought the emperor not to condemn Athanasius during his absence,
nor to give credit to enactments which were evidently obtained by the
machinations of his enemies. With respect to the alleged injuries which
had been inflicted on his two brothers, he entreated the emperor not to
revenge himself by the hands of priests who had been set apart by God,
not for the execution of vengeance, but for sanctification, and the
performance of just and benevolent actions.

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p5"></span>The emperor perceiving that Liberius was
not disposed to comply with his mandate, commanded that he should be
conveyed to Thrace, unless he would change his mind within two days. “To
me, O emperor,” replied Liberius, “there is no need of deliberation; my
resolution has long been formed and decided, and I am ready to go forth
to exile.” It is said, that when he was being conducted to banishment,
the emperor sent him five hundred pieces of gold; he, however, refused
to receive them, and said to the messenger who brought them, “Go, and
tell him who sent this gold to give it to the flatterers and
hypocrites <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) who surround him,
for their insatiable cupidity plunges them into a state of perpetual
want which can never be relieved. Christ, who is in all respects, <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md) like unto his Father, supplies us
with food and with all good things.”

<span id="iii.ix.xi-p8"></span>Liberius having for the above reasons
been deposed from the Roman church, his government was transferred to
Felix, a deacon of the clergy there. It is said that Felix always
continued in adherence to the Nicene faith; and that, with respect to
his conduct in religious matters he was blameless. The only thing
alleged against him was, that, prior to his ordination, he held
communion with the heterodox. When the emperor entered Rome, the people
loudly demanded Liberius, and besought his return; after consulting with
the bishops who were with him, he replied that he would recall Liberius
and restore him to the people, if he would consent to embrace the same
sentiments as those held by the priests of the court.
