<span id="ii.vii.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—</span>*Eunomius supersedes
Eleusius the Macedonian in the See of Cyzicus, His Origin and Imitation
of Aëtius, whose Amanuensis he had been.*

<span id="ii.vii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.vii-p2.1"></span>The</span> bishop of Constantinople being
informed of these circumstances, constituted Eunomius bishop of Cyzicus,
inasmuch as he was a person able by his eloquence to win over the minds
of the multitude to his own way of thinking. On his arrival at Cyzicus
an imperial edict was published in which it was ordered that Eleusius
should be ejected, and Eunomius installed in his place. This being
carried into effect, those who attached themselves to Eleusius, after
erecting a sacred edifice without the city, assembled there with him.
But enough has been said of Eleusius: let us now give some account of
Eunomius. He had been secretary to Aëtius, surnamed Atheus, of whom we
have before spoken, <span id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) and had
learnt from conversing with him, to imitate his sophistical mode of
reasoning; being little aware that while exercising himself in framing
fallacious arguments, and in the use of certain insignificant terms, he
was really deceiving himself. This habit however inflated him with
pride, and he fell into blasphemous heresies, and so became an advocate
of the dogmas of Arius, and in various ways an adversary to the
doctrines of truth. And as he had but a very slender knowledge of the
letter of Scripture, he was wholly unable to enter into the spirit of
it. Yet he abounded in words, and was accustomed to repeat the same
thoughts in different terms, without ever arriving at a clear
explanation of what he had proposed to himself. Of this his seven books
*On the Apostle’s Epistle to the Romans,* on which he bestowed a
quantity of vain labor, is a remarkable proof: for although he has
employed an immense number of words in the attempt to expound it, he has
by no means succeeded in apprehending the scope and object of that
epistle. All other works of his extant are of a similar character, in
which he that would take the trouble to examine them, would find a great
scarcity of sense, amidst a profusion of verbiage. This Eunomius
Eudoxius promoted to the see of Cyzicus; <span
id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) who being come thither, astonished his
auditors by the extraordinary display of his ‘dialectic’ art, and thus a
great sensation was produced at Cyzicus. At length the people unable to
endure any longer the empty and assumptions parade of his language,
drove him out of their city. He therefore withdrew to Constantinople,
and taking up his abode with Eudoxius, was regarded as a titular <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) bishop. But lest we should seem to
have said these things for the sake of detraction, let us hear what
Eunomius himself has the hardihood to utter in his sophistical
discourses concerning the Deity himself, for he uses the following
language: ‘God knows no more of his own substance than we do; nor is
this more known to him, and less to us: but whatever we know about the
Divine substance, that precisely is known to God; and on the other hand,
whatever he knows, the same also you will find without any difference in
us.’ This and many other similar tedious and absurd fallacies Eunomius
was accustomed to draw up in utter insensibility to his own folly. On
what account he afterwards separated from the Arians, we shall state in
its proper place. <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md)

<span id="ii.vii.vii-p4"></span>Sozom. VI. 8, gives the same account;
but Philostorgius (V. 3) and Theodoret (*H. E.* II. 37 and 39) say that
Eunomius was made bishop of Cyzicus under the Emperor Constantius
immediately after the Synod of Seleucia. He was banished by Valens
because he favored the usurper Procopius.

(*Greek Lexicon of the Rom. and Byzantine Periods*) as *suspended*. It
appears, however, that among the civil and military officers in the
Roman system there were some who bore the title without being concerned
in the management of their offices, and that these were termed
*vacantes* and therefore that Socrates is using the Greek equivalent of
a Latin term and applying it in ecclesiastical matters as its original
was applied in civil and military affairs. Cf., on the position of
bishops without churches Bingham, *Christ. Antiq.* IV. ii. 14. This
system of clerics without charges was abused so much that the Council of
Chalcedon (Canon 6) forbade further ordination *sine titulo.*
