<span id="iii.xi.xxx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*Monks of Scetis:
Origen, Didymus, Cronion, Orsisius, Putubatus, Arsion, Serapion, Ammon,
Eusebius, and Dioscorus, the Brethren who are called Long, and Evagrius
the Philosopher*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxx-p2.1"></span>At</span> this period, Origen, one of the
disciples of Antony the Great, was still living at a great age, in the
monasteries of Scetis. <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) Also,
Didymus, and Cronion, who was about one hundred and ten years of age,
Arsisius the Great, Putubatus, Arsion, and Serapion, all of whom had
been contemporary with Antony the Great. They had grown old in the
exercise of philosophy, and were at this period presiding over the
monasteries. There were some holy men among them who were young and
middle aged, but who were celebrated for their excellent and good
qualities. Among these were Ammonius, Eusebius, and Dioscorus. They were
brothers, but on account of their height of stature were called the
“Long Brothers.” <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) It is said
that Ammon attained the summit of philosophy, and consequently overcame
the love of ease and pleasure. He was very studious, and had read the
works of Origen, of Didymus, and of other ecclesiastical writers. From
his youth to the day of his death he never tasted anything, with the
exception of bread, that had been prepared by means of fire. He was once
chosen to be ordained bishop; and after urging every argument that could
be devised in rejection of the honor, but in vain, he cut off one of his
ears, and said to those who had come for him, “Go away. Henceforward the
priestly law forbids my ordination, for the person of a priest should be
perfect.” Those who had been sent for him accordingly departed; but, on
ascertaining that the Church does not observe the Jewish law in
requiring a priest to be perfect in all his members, but merely requires
him to be irreprehensible in point of morals, they returned to Ammon,
and endeavored to take him by force. He protested to them that, if they
attempted any violence against him, he would cut out his tongue; and,
terrified at this menace, they immediately took their departure. Ammon
was ever after surnamed Parotes. Some time afterwards, during the
ensuing reign, the wise Evagrius formed an intimacy with him.
Evagrius <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) was a wise man,
powerful in thought and in word, and skillful in discerning the
arguments which led to virtue and to vice, and capable in urging others
to imitate the one, and to eschew the other. His eloquence is fully
attested by the works he has left behind him. <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) With respect to his moral
character, it is said that he was totally free from all pride or
superciliousness, so that he was not elated when just commendations were
awarded him, nor displeased when unjust reproaches were brought against
him. He was a citizen of Iberia, near the Euxine. He had philosophized
and studied the Sacred Scriptures under Gregory, bishop of Nazianzen,
and had filled the office of archdeacon when Gregory administered the
church in Constantinople. He was handsome in person, and careful in his
mode of attire; and hence an acquaintanceship he had formed with a
certain lady excited the jealousy of her husband, who plotted his death.
While the plot was about being carried forward into deed, God sent him
while sleeping, a fearful and saving vision in a dream. It appeared to
him that he had been arrested in the act of committing some crime, and
that he was bound hand and foot in irons. As he was being led before the
magistrates to receive the sentence of condemnation, a man who held in
his hand the book of the Holy Gospels addressed him, and promised to
deliver him from his bonds, and confirmed this <span id="page_369">p.
369</span> <span id="iii.xi.xxx-Page_369"></span>with an oath, provided
he would quit the city. Evagrius touched the book, and made oath that he
would do so. Immediately his chains appeared to fall off, and he awoke.
He was convinced by this divine dream, and fled the danger. He resolved
upon devoting himself to a life of asceticism, and proceeded from
Constantinople to Jerusalem. Some time after he went to visit the
philosophers of Scetis, and gladly determined to live there.
