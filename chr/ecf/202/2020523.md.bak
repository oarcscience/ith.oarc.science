<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Innocent the Bishop of
the Presbytery of Rome. He sent an Embassy to Alaric. Jovius, Prefect of
Italy. Embassy dispatched to the Emperor. Events concerning Alaric*.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p2.1"></span>Although</span> ambassadors were dispatched
to treat of peace, <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) the
enemies of Alaric at the court of the emperor sedulously guarded against
the conclusion of any treaty with him. But after this, when an embassy
had been sent to him by Innocent, bishop of Rome, and Alaric was
summoned by a letter of the emperor, he repaired to the city of
Ariminum, which is two hundred and ten stadia distant from Ravenna.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p4"></span>He encamped beyond the walls of the
city; and Jovius, the prefect of Italy, held a conference with him and
conveyed his demands to the emperor, one of which was, that he might be
appointed by an edict to the generalship of the cavalry and infantry.
The emperor gave full power to Jovius to grant Alaric as much money and
provision as he might desire, but refused ever to confer this dignity
upon him. Jovius unadvisedly awaited the messenger from the palace, in
the camp of Alaric; and commanded the decision of the emperor to be read
in the presence of all the barbarians. On finding that the dignity was
denied him, Alaric was enraged at the result, ordered the trumpets to be
sounded, and marched towards Rome. Jovius, apprehensive of being
suspected by the emperor of siding with Alaric, committed a still
greater act of imprudence by taking an oath on the safety of the
emperor, and compelling the principal officers to swear that they would
never consent to any terms of peace with Alaric. The barbarian chief,
however, soon after changed his mind, and sent word he did not desire
any post of dignity, but was willing to act as an ally of the Romans,
provided that they would grant him a certain quantity of corn, and some
territory of secondary importance to them, in which he might establish
himself.
