<span id="ii.x.xlviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII</span>.—*Thalassius is
ordained Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia.*

<span id="ii.x.xlviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xlviii-p2.1"></span>About</span> this same time, under the
seventeenth consulate of Theodosius, <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039) Proclus the bishop undertook the
performance of an act, such as no one among the ancients had done.
Firmus bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia being dead, the inhabitants of
that place came to Constantinople to consult Proclus about the
appointment of a bishop. While Proclus was considering whom he should
prefer to that see, it so happened that all the senators came to the
church to visit him on the sabbath day; among whom was Thalassius also,
a man who had administered the government of the nations and cities of
Illyricum. And as it was reported that the emperor was about to entrust
the government of the Eastern parts to him, Proclus laid his hands on
him, and ordained him bishop of Cæsarea, instead of Prætorian Prefect.

<span id="ii.x.xlviii-p4"></span>In such a flourishing condition were
the affairs of the Church at this time. But we shall here close our
history, praying that the churches everywhere, with the cities and
nations, may live in peace; for as long as peace continues, those who
desire to write histories will find no materials for their purpose. And
we ourselves, O holy man of God, Theodore, should have been unable to
accomplish in seven books the task we undertook at your request, had the
lovers of seditions chosen to be quiet.

<span id="ii.x.xlviii-p5"></span>This last book contains an account of
the transactions of thirty-two years: and the whole history which is
comprised in seven books, comprehends a period of 140 years. <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040) It commences from the first year of
the 271st Olympiad, in which Constantine was proclaimed emperor; and
ends at the second year of the 305th Olympiad, in which the Emperor
Theodosius bore his seventeenth consulate. <span

with the year 305 (cf. I. 1), and the exact number of years included in
the history cannot be more than 135.
