<span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Canons appointed by
the Council; Paphnutius, a certain Confessor, restrains the Council from
forming a Canon enjoining Celibacy to all who were about to be honored
with the Priesthood*.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Zealous</span> of reforming the life of
those who were engaged about the churches, the Synod enacted laws which
were called canons. <span id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md) While
they were deliberating about this, some thought that a law ought to be
passed enacting that bishops and presbyters, deacons and subdeacons,
should hold no intercourse with the wife they had espoused before they
entered the priesthood; but Paphnutius, <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133.md) the confessor, stood up and
testified against this proposition; he said that marriage was honorable
and chaste, and that cohabitation with their own wives was chastity, and
advised the Synod not to frame such a law, for it would be difficult to
bear, and might serve as an occasion of incontinence to them and their
wives; and he reminded them, that according to the ancient tradition of
the church, those who were unmarried when they took part in the
communion of sacred orders, were required to remain so, but that those
who were married, were not to put away their wives. Such was the advice
of Paphnutius, although he was himself unmarried, and in accordance with
it, the Synod concurred in his counsel, enacted no law about it, but
left the matter to the decision of individual judgment, and not to
compulsion. The Synod, however, enacted other laws regulating the
government of the Church; and these laws may easily be found, as they
are in the possession of many individuals.
