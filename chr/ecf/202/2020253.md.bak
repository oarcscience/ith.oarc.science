<span id="ii.x.xxxvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI</span>.—*The Author’s Opinion
of the Validity of Translations from One See to Another.*

<span id="ii.x.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> since some parties by appealing
to a prohibition in the ecclesiastical canon, prevented the election of
Proclus, because of his previous appointment to the see of Cyzicus, I
wish to make a few remarks on this subject. Those who then presumed to
interpose such a cause of exclusion do not appear to me to have stated
the truth; but they were either influenced by prejudice against Proclus,
or at least have been themselves completely ignorant both of the canons,
and of the frequent and often advantageous precedents that had been
established in the churches. Eusebius Pamphilus relates in the sixth
book of his *Ecclesiastical History,* <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md) that Alexander bishop of a certain
city in Cappadocia, coming to Jerusalem for devotional purposes, was
detained by the inhabitants of that city, and constituted bishop, as the
successor of Narcissus; and that he continued to preside over the
churches there during the remainder of his life. So indifferent a thing
was it amongst our ancestors, to transfer a bishop from one city to
another as often as it was deemed expedient. But if it is necessary to
place beyond a doubt the falsehood of the statement of those who
prevented the ordination of Proclus, I shall annex to this treatise the
canon bearing on the subject. It runs thus: <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md)

<span id="ii.x.xxxvi-p5"></span>‘If any one after having been ordained a
bishop should not proceed to the church unto which he has been
appointed, from no fault on his part, but either because the people are
unwilling to receive him, or for some other reason arising from
necessity, let him be partaker of the honor and functions of the rank
with which he has been invested, provided he intermeddles not with the
affairs of the church wherein he may minister. It is his duty however to
submit to whatever the Synod of the province may see fit to determine,
after it shall have taken cognizance of the matter.’

<span id="ii.x.xxxvi-p6"></span>Such is the language of the canon. That
many bishops have been transferred from one city to another to meet the
exigencies of peculiar cases, I shall now prove by giving the names of
those bishops who have been so translated. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) Perigenes was ordained bishop of
Patræ: but inasmuch as the inhabitants of that city refused to admit
him, the bishop of Rome directed that he should be assigned to the
metropolitan see of Corinth, which had become vacant by the decease of
its former bishop; here he presided during the rest of his days. Gregory
was first made bishop of Sasima, one of the cities of Cappadocia, but
was afterwards transferred to Nazianzus. Melitius after having presided
over the church at Sebastia, subsequently governed that of Antioch.
Alexander bishop of Antioch transferred Dositheus bishop of Seleucia, to
Tarsus in Cilicia. Reverentius was removed from Arca in Phœnicia, and
afterwards to Tyre. John was transferred from Gordum a city of Lydia, to
Proconnesus, and presided over the church there. Palladius was
transferred from Helenopolis to Aspuna; and Alexander from the same city
to Adriani. Theophilus was removed from Apamea in Asia, to Eudoxiopolis
anciently called Salambria. Polycarp was transferred from Sexantaprista
a city of Mysia, to Nicopolis in Thrace. Hierophilus from Trapezopolis
in Phrygia to Plotinopolis in Thrace. Optimus from Agdamia in Phrygia to
Antioch in Pisidia; and Silvanus from Philippopolis in Thrace to Troas.
This enumeration of bishops who have passed from one see to another is
sufficient for the present; concerning Silvanus who was removed from
Philippopolis in Thrace to Troas I deem it desirable here to give a
concise account.
