malevolent and impious practices against the Christians, and drew down
upon themselves deserved punishment. At a place named Inmestar, situated
between Chalcis and Antioch in Syria, the Jews were amusing themselves
in their usual way with a variety of sports. In this way they indulged
in many absurdities, and at length impelled by drunkenness they were
guilty of scoffing at Christians and even Christ himself; and in
derision of the cross and those who put their trust in the Crucified
One, they seized a Christian boy, and having bound him to a cross, began
to laugh and sneer at him. But in a little while becoming so transported
with fury, they scourged the child until he died under their hands. This
conduct occasioned a sharp conflict between them and the Christians; and
as soon as the emperors were informed of the circumstance, they issued
orders to the governor of the province to find out and punish the
delinquents. And thus the Jewish inhabitants of this place paid the
penalty for the wickedness they had committed in their impious sport.
