<span id="iii.vii.ix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Sapor King of Persia is
Excited against the Christians. Symeon, Bishop of Persia, and
Usthazanes, a Eunuch, Suffer the Agony of Martyrdom*.

<span id="iii.vii.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>When</span>, in course of time, the
Christians increased in number, and began to form churches, and
appointed priests and deacons, the Magi, who as a priestly tribe had
from the beginning in successive generations acted as the guardians of
the Persian religion, became deeply incensed against them. <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md) The Jews, who through envy are in
some way naturally opposed to the Christian religion, were likewise
offended. They therefore brought accusations before Sapor, the reigning
sovereign, against Symeon, who was then archbishop of Seleucia and
Ctesiphon, royal cities of Persia, and charged him with being a friend
of the Cæsar of the Romans, and with communicating the affairs of the
Persians to him. Sapor believed these accusations, and at first, ground
the Christians with excessive taxes, although he knew that the
generality of them had voluntarily embraced poverty. He entrusted the
exaction to cruel men, hoping that, by the want of necessaries, and the
atrocity of the exactors, they might be compelled to abjure their
religion; for this was his aim. Afterwards, however, he commanded that
the priests and conductors of the worship of God should be slain with
the sword. The churches were demolished, their vessels were deposited in
the treasury, and Symeon was arrested as a traitor to the kingdom and
the religion of the Persians. Thus the Magi, with the co-operation of
the Jews, quickly destroyed the houses of prayer. Symeon, on his
apprehension, was bound with chains, and brought before the king. There
the man evinced his excellence and courage; for when Sapor commanded
that he should be led away to the torture, he did not fear, and would
not prostrate himself. The king, greatly exasperated, demanded why he
did not prostrate himself as he had done formerly. Symeon replied,
“Formerly I was not led away bound in order that I might abjure the
truth of God, and there<span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="iii.vii.ix-Page_265"></span>fore I did not then object to pay the
customary respect to royalty; but now it would not be proper for me to
do so; for I stand here in defense of godliness and of our opinion.”
When he ceased speaking, the king commanded him to worship the sun,
promising, as an inducement, to bestow gifts upon him, and to hold him
in honor; but on the other hand, threatening, in case of non-compliance,
to visit him and the whole body of Christians with destruction. When the
king found that he neither frightened him by menaces, nor caused him to
relax by promises, and that Symeon remained firm and refused to worship
the sun, or to betray his religion, he commanded him to be put in bonds
for a while, probably imagining that he would change his mind.

<span id="iii.vii.ix-p4"></span>When Symeon was being conducted to
prison, Usthazanes, an aged eunuch, the foster-father of Sapor and
superintendent of the palace, who happened to be sitting at the gates of
the palace, arose to do him reverence. Symeon reproachfully forbade him
in a loud and haughty voice, averted his countenance, and passed by; for
the eunuch had been formerly a Christian, but had recently yielded to
authority, and had worshiped the sun. This conduct so affected the
eunuch that he wept aloud, laid aside the white garment with which he
was robed, and clothed himself, as a mourner, in black. He then seated
himself in front of the palace, crying and groaning, and saying, “Woe is
me! What must not await me since I have denied God; and on this account
Symeon, formerly my familiar friend, does not think me worthy of being
spoken to, but turns away and hastens from me.” When Sapor heard of what
had occurred, he called the eunuch to him, and inquired into the cause
of his grief, and asked him whether any calamity had befallen his
family. Usthazanes replied and said, “O king, nothing has occurred to my
family; but I would rather have suffered any other affliction whatsoever
than that which has befallen me, and it would have been easy to bear.
Now I mourn because I am alive, and ought to have been dead long ago;
yet I still see the sun which, not voluntarily, but to please thee, I
professed to worship. Therefore, on both accounts, it is just that I
should die, for I have been a betrayer of Christ, and a deceiver of
thee.” He then swore by the Maker of heaven and earth, that he would
never swerve from his convictions. Sapor, astonished at the wonderful
conversion of the eunuch, was still more enraged against the Christians,
as if they had effected it by enchantments. Still, he spared the old
man, and strove with all his strength, by alternate gentleness and
harshness, to bring him over to his own sentiments. But finding that his
efforts were useless, and that Usthazanes persisted in declaring that he
would never be so foolish as to worship the creature instead of the
creator, he became inflamed with passion, and commanded that the
eunuch’s head should be struck off with a sword. When the executioners
came forward to perform their office, Usthazanes requested them to wait
a little, that he might communicate something to the king. He then
called one of the most faithful eunuchs, and bade him say to Sapor,
“From my youth until now I have been well affected, O king, to your
house, and have ministered with fitting diligence to your father and
yourself. I need no witnesses to corroborate my statements; these facts
are well established. For all the matters wherein at divers times I have
gladly served you, grant me this reward; let it not be imagined by those
who are ignorant of the circumstances, that I have incurred this
punishment by acts of unfaithfulness against the kingdom, or by the
commission of any other crime; but let it be published and proclaimed
abroad by a herald, that Usthazanes loses his head for no knavery that
he has ever committed in the palaces, but for being a Christian, and for
refusing to obey the king in denying his own God.” The eunuch delivered
this message, and Sapor, according to the request of Usthazanes,
commanded a herald to make the desired proclamation; for the king
imagined that others would be easily deterred from embracing
Christianity, by reflecting that he who sacrificed his aged
foster-father and esteemed household servant, would assuredly spare no
other Christian. Usthazanes, however, believed that as by his timidity
in consenting to worship the sun, he had caused many Christians to fear,
so now, by the diligent proclamation of the cause of his sufferings,
many might be edified by learning that he died for the sake of religion,
and so became imitators of his fortitude.
