id="iii.xiii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*Effort of
Innocent, Bishop of Rome, to recall John through a Council. Concerning
those who were sent by him to make Trial of the Matter. The Death of
John Chrysostom*.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Innocent</span>, bishop of Rome, was
very anxious, as appears by his former letter, to procure the recall of
John. <span id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619)  <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620) He sent five bishops and two
presbyters of the Roman church, with the bishops who had been delegated
as ambassadors to him from the East, to the emperors Honorius <span
id="page_418">p. 418</span> <span
id="iii.xiii.xxviii-Page_418"></span>and Arcadius, to request the
convocation of a council, and solicit them to name time and place. The
enemies of John at Constantinople framed a charge as though these things
were done to insult the Eastern emperor, and caused the ambassadors to
be ignominiously dismissed as if they had invaded a foreign government.
John was at the same time condemned by an imperial edict to a remoter
place of banishment, and soldiers were sent to conduct him to Pityus;
the soldiers were soon on hand, and effected the removal. It is said
that during this journey, Basiliscus, the martyr, appeared to him at
Comani, in Armenia, and apprised him of the day of his death. Being
attacked with pain in the head, and being unable to bear the heat of the
sun, he could not prosecute his journey, but closed his life in that
town.
