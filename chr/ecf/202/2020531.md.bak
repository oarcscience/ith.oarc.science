Honorius again laid siege to the city. <span

of Edovicus he cast aside his purple robe and imperial ornaments, and
repaired to the church, where he caused him<span id="page_427">p.

presbyter. Those within the walls, having first received oaths, opened
the gates, and their lives were spared. From that period the whole
province returned to its allegiance to Honorius, and has since been
obedient to the rulers of his appointment. Constantine, with his son
Julian, was sent into Italy, but he was waylaid and killed. Not long
afterwards Jovianus and Maximus, the tyrants above mentioned, Saros, and
many others who had conspired against Honorius, were unexpectedly slain.
