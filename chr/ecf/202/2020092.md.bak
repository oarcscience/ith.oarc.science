<span id="ii.v.xlii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII</span>.—*On the Deposition of
Macedonius, Eudoxius obtains the Bishopric of Constantinople.*

<span id="ii.v.xlii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xlii-p2.1"></span>Acacius</span>, Eudoxius, and those at
Constantinople who took part with them, became exceedingly anxious that
they also on their side might depose some of the opposite party. Now it
should be observed that neither of the factions were influenced by
religious considerations in making depositions, but by other motives:
for although they did not agree respecting the faith, yet the ground of
their reciprocal depositions was not error in doctrine. The Acacian
party therefore availing themselves of the emperor’s indignation against
others, and especially against Macedonius, which he was cherishing and
anxious to vent, in the first place deposed Macedonius, both on account
of his having occasioned so much slaughter, and also because he had
admitted to communion a deacon who had been found guilty of
fornication. <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) They then depose
Eleusius bishop of Cyzicus, for having baptized, and afterwards invested
with the diaconate, a priest of Hercules at Tyre named Heraclius, who
was known to have practiced magic arts. <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) A like sentence was pronounced against
Basil, or Basilas,—as he was also called,—who had been constituted
bishop of Ancyra instead of Marcellus: the causes assigned for this
condemnation were, that he had unjustly imprisoned a certain individual,
loaded him with chains, and put him to the torture; that he had traduced
some persons; and that he had disturbed the churches of Africa by his
epistles. Dracontius was also deposed, because he had left the Galatian
church for that of Pergamos. Moreover they deposed, on various
pretenses, Neonas bishop of Seleucia, the city in which the Synod had
been convened, Sophronius of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, Elpidius of
Satala, in Macedonia, and Cyril of Jerusalem, and others for various
reasons.
