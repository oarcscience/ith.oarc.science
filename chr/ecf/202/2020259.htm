<p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xlii-p3"></A><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xlii-p3.1"></A>For</span> these reasons the emperor had the highest esteem for Proclus. For in fact he himself was a pattern to all true clergymen, and never approved of those who attempted to persecute others. Nay I may venture to affirm, that in meekness he surpassed all those who have ever faithfully borne the sacerdotal office. And what is recorded of Moses in the book of Numbers,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1030"></A><A HREF="#fn_1030"><FONT SIZE="1">1031</FONT></A>
  &#145;Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth&#146;&#8212;may most justly be applied at this day; for the Emperor Theodosius is &#145;meek above all the men which are upon the face of the earth.&#146; It is because of this meekness that God subdued his enemies without martial conflicts, as the capture of the usurper John,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1031"><FONT SIZE="1">1032</FONT></A>
  and the subsequent discomfiture of the barbarians clearly demonstrate. For the God of the universe has afforded this most devout emperor in our times supernatural aid of a similar kind to what was vouchsafed to the righteous heretofore. I write not these things from adulation, but truthfully narrate facts such as everybody can attest. </p>
