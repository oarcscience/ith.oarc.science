<span id="iii.xiv.x-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*A Roman Lady who
manifested a Deed of Modesty*.

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.x-p2.1"></span>It</span> is obvious that the capture of so
great a city as Rome must have been attended with many remarkable
circumstances. I shall, therefore, now proceed to the narration of such
events as seem worthy of a place in ecclesiastical history. <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633) I shall recount a pious action
performed by a barbarian, and record the bravery of a Roman lady for the
preservation of her chastity. The barbarian and the lady were both
Christians, but not of the same heresy, the former being an Arian, and
the latter a zealous follower of the Nicene doctrines. A young man of
Alaric’s soldiers saw this very beautiful woman, and was conquered by
her loveliness, and tried to drag her into intercourse; but she drew
back, and exerted herself that she might not suffer pollution. He drew
his sword, and threatened to <span id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span
id="iii.xiv.x-Page_425"></span>slay her; but he was restrained by the
passion which he entertained toward her, and merely inflicted a slight
wound on her neck. The blood flowed in abundance, and she offered her
neck to the sword; for she preferred to die in her chastity than to
survive, after having consorted lawfully with a husband, and then to be
attempted by another man. When the barbarian repeated his purpose, and
followed it with more fearful threats, he accomplished nothing further;
struck with wonder at her chastity, he conducted her to the church of
Peter the apostle, and gave six pieces of gold for her support to the
officers who were guarding the church, and commanded them to keep her
for her husband.
