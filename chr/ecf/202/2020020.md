<span id="ii.iv.xi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*Of the Bishop Paphnutius.*

<span id="ii.iv.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xi-p2.1"></span>As</span> we have promised above <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194) to make some mention of Paphnutius and
Spyridon, it is time to speak of them here. Paphnutius then was bishop
of one of the cities in Upper Thebes: he was a man so favored divinely
that extraordinary miracles were done by him. In the time of the
persecution he had been deprived of one of his eyes. The emperor honored
this man exceedingly, and often sent for him to the palace, and kissed
the part where the eye had been torn out. So great devoutness
characterized the emperor Constantine. Let this single fact respecting
Paphnutius suffice: I shall now explain another thing which came to pass
in consequence of his advice, both for the good of the Church and the
honor of the clergy. It seemed fit to the bishops to introduce a new law
into the Church, that those who were in holy orders, I speak of bishops,
presbyters, and deacons, should have no conjugal intercourse with the
wives whom they had married while still laymen. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195) Now when discussion on this matter was
impending, Paphnutius having arisen in the midst of the assembly of
bishops, earnestly entreated them not to impose so heavy a yoke on the
ministers of religion: asserting that ‘marriage itself is honorable, and
the bed undefiled’; <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196) urging
before God that they ought not to injure the Church by too stringent
restrictions. ‘For all men,’ said he, ‘cannot bear the practice of rigid
continence; neither perhaps would the chastity of the wife of each be
preserved’: and he termed the intercourse of a man with his lawful wife
chastity. It would be sufficient, he thought, that such as had
previously entered on their sacred calling should abjure matrimony,
according to the ancient tradition of the Church: but that none should
be separated from her to whom, while yet unordained, he had been united.
And these sentiments he expressed, although himself without experience
of marriage, and, to speak plainly, without ever having known a woman:
for from a boy he had been brought up in a monastery, <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197) and was specially renowned above all
men for his chastity. The whole assembly of the clergy assented to the
reasoning of Paphnutius: wherefore they silenced all further debate on
this point, leaving it to the discretion of those who were husbands to
exercise abstinence if they so wished in reference to their wives. Thus
much concerning Paphnutius.
