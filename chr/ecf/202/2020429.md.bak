<span id="iii.xi.xiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Demophilus, an Arian,
became Bishop of Constantinople after Eudoxius. The Pious elect
Evagrius. Account of the Persecution which ensued*.

<span id="iii.xi.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xiii-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time the Emperor Valens
went to Antioch on the Orontes; while he was on his journey Eudoxius
died, after having governed the churches of Constantinople during the
space of eleven years. <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md)
Demophilus was immediately ordained as his successor by the Arian
bishops. The followers of the Nicene doctrines, believing that the
course of events was in their power, elected Evagrius as their bishop.
He had been ordained by Eustathius, who had formerly governed the church
of Antioch in Syria, and who having been recalled from banishment by
Jovian, lived in a private manner at Constantinople, and devoted himself
to the instruction of those who held his sentiments, exhorting them to
perseverance in their view of the Divine Being. The Arian heretics were
stirred to revolt, and commenced a violent persecution against those who
had participated in the ordination of Evagrius. The Emperor Valens, who
was then at Nicomedia, on being apprised of the occurrences that had
taken place in Constantinople since the death of Eudoxius, was fearful
lest any interest of the city should suffer by sedition, and therefore
sent thither as many troops as he thought requisite to preserve
tranquillity.

<span id="iii.xi.xiii-p4"></span><span id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xiii-Page_355"></span>Eustathius was arrested by his command
and banished to Bizya, a city of Thrace, and Evagrius was exiled to some
other region. And such was the manner of this event.
