<span id="ii.x.xl-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL</span>.—*Proclus succeeds Maximian
Bishop of Constantinople.*

<span id="ii.x.xl-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xl-p2.1"></span>Maximian</span>, having peacefully governed the
church during two years and five months, died on the 12th of April, in
the consulate of Areobindus and Aspar. <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md) This happened to be on the fifth
day of the week of fasts which immediately precedes Easter. The day of
the week was Thursday. Then the Emperor Theodosius wishing to prevent
the disturbances in the church which usually attend the election of a
bishop, made a wise provision for this affair; for in order that there
might be no dispute again about the choice of a bishop and tumult thus
arise, without delaying, before the body of Maximian was interred, he
directed the bishops who were then in the city to place Proclus in the
episcopal chair. For he had received already letters from Cælestinus
bishop of Rome approving of this election, which he had forwarded to
Cyril of Alexandria, John of Antioch, and Rufus of Thessalonica; in
which he assured them that there was no impediment to the translation to
another see, of a person who had been nominated and really was the
bishop of some one church. Proclus, being thus invested with the
bishopric, performed the funeral obsequies of Maximian: but it is now
time briefly to give some account of him also.
