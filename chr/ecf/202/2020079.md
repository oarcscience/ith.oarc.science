<span id="ii.v.xxix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Of the Heresiarch
Photinus.*

<span id="ii.v.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxix-p2.1"></span>During</span> this time Photinus, <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) who then presided over the church in
that city more openly avowed the creed he had devised; wherefore a
tumult being made in consequence, the emperor ordered a Synod of bishops
to be held at Sirmium. There were accordingly convened there of the
Oriental bishops, <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) Mark of
Arethusa, George of Alexandria, whom the Arians sent, as I have before
said, having placed him over that see on the removal of Gregory, Basil
who presided over the church at Ancyra after Marcellus was ejected,
Pancratius of Pelusium, and Hypatian of Heraclea. Of the Western bishops
there were present Valens of Mursa, and the then celebrated Hosius of
Cordova in Spain, who attended much against his will. These met at
Sirmium, after the consulate of Sergius and Nigrinian, <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) in which year no consul celebrated the
customary inaugural <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) solemnities,
in consequence of the tumults of war; and having met and found that
Photinus held the heresy of Sabellius the Libyan, and Paul of Samosata,
they immediately deposed him. This decision was both at that time and
afterwards universally commended as honorable and just; but those who
continued there, subsequently acted in a way which was by no means so
generally approved.
