<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*Alaric the Goth. He
assaulted Rome, and straitened it by War*.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.vi-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> was the Eastern Empire preserved
from the evils of war, <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) and
governed with high order, contrary to all expectations, for its ruler
was still young. In the meantime, the Western Empire fell a prey to
disorders, because many tyrants arose. After the death of Stilicho,
Alaric, the leader of the Goths, sent an embassy to Honorius to treat of
peace; but without avail. He advanced to Rome, and laid siege to it; and
by posting a large army of barbarians on the banks of the Tiber, he
effectually prevented the transmission of all provisions into the city
from Portus. After the siege had lasted some time, and fearful ravages
had been made in the city by famine and pestilence, many of the slaves,
and most of the barbarians by race within the walls, deserted to Alaric.
Those among the senators who still adhered to pagan superstition,
proposed to offer sacrifices in the Capitol and the other temples; and
certain Tuscans, who were summoned by the prefect of the city, promised
to drive out the barbarians with thunder and lightning; they boasted of
having performed a similar exploit at Larnia, a city of Tuscany, which
Alaric had passed by for Rome, and had not taken. The event, however,
proved that no advantage could be derived from these persons for the
city. All persons of good sense were aware that the calamities which
this siege entailed upon the Romans were indications of Divine wrath
sent to chastise them for their luxury, their debauch<span
id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span id="iii.xiv.vi-Page_423"></span>ery,
and their manifold acts of injustice towards each other, as well as
towards strangers. It is said that, when Alaric was marching against
Rome, a good monk of Italy besought him to spare the city, and not to
become the author of so many calamities. Alaric, in reply, assured him
that he did not feel disposed to commence the siege, but that some
resistless influence compelled and commanded him to go against Rome; and
this he eventually did. While he was besieging the city, the inhabitants
presented many gifts to him, and for some time he raised the siege, when
the Romans agreed to persuade the emperor to enter into a treaty of
peace with him.
