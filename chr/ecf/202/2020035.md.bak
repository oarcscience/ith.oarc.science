<span id="ii.iv.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Arius, on being
recalled, presents a Recantation to the Emperor, and pretends to accept
the Nicene Creed.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxvi-p2.1"></span>They</span> having drawn up a declaration to
the following effect, presented it to the emperor.

<span id="ii.iv.xxvi-p3"></span>‘Arius and Euzoïus, to our Most
Religious and Pious Lord, the Emperor Constantine.

<span id="ii.iv.xxvi-p4"></span>‘In accordance with the command of your
devout piety, sovereign lord, we declare our faith, and before God
profess in writing, that we and our adherents believe as follows:

<span id="ii.iv.xxvi-p5"></span>‘We believe in one God the Father
Almighty: and in the Lord Jesus Christ his Son, who was begotten <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) of him before all ages, God the Word
through whom all things were made, both those which are in the heavens
and those upon the earth; who descended, and became incarnate, and
suffered, and rose again, ascended into the heavens, and will again come
to judge the living and the dead. \[We believe\] also in the Holy
Spirit, and in the resurrection of the flesh, and in the life of the
coming age, and in the kingdom of the heavens, and in one Catholic
Church of God, extending from one end of the earth to the other.

<span id="ii.iv.xxvi-p7"></span>‘This faith we have received from the
holy gospels, the Lord therein saying to his disciples: <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) “Go and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”
If we do not so believe and truly receive the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit, as the whole Catholic Church and the holy <span
id="page_29">p. 29</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xxvi-Page_29"></span>Scriptures teach (in which we believe in
every respect), God is our judge both now, and in the coming judgment.
Wherefore we beseech your piety, most devout emperor, that we who are
persons consecrated to the ministry, and holding the faith and
sentiments of the church and of the holy Scriptures, may by your pacific
and devoted piety be reunited to our mother, the Church, all superfluous
questions and disputings being avoided: that so both we and the whole
church being at peace, may in common offer our accustomed prayers for
your tranquil reign, and on behalf of your whole family.’

<span id="ii.iv.xxvi-p6"></span>The old English translation rendered
‘made’ on the assumption that the Greek was <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxvi-p6.1"></span>γεγενημένον</span> , not <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.xxvi-p6.2"></span>γεγεννημένον</span> . So
also Valesius read and translated ‘*factum*’; but Bright without
mentioning any variant reading, gives <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.xxvi-p6.3"></span>γεγεννημένον</span> , and we have ventured
to translate accordingly.
