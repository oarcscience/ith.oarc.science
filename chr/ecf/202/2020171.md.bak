<span id="ii.viii.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—</span>*Gregory of Nazianzus is
transferred to the See of Constantinople. The Emperor Theodosius falling
Sick at Thessalonica, after his Victory over the Barbarians, is there
baptized by Ascholius the Bishop.*

<span id="ii.viii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>By</span> the common suffrage of many
bishops, Gregory was at this time translated from the see of Nazianzus
to that of Constantinople, <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) and
this happened in the manner before described. About the same time the
emperors Gratian and Theodosius each obtained a victory over the
barbarians. <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) And Gratian
immediately set out for Gaul, because the Alemanni were ravaging those
provinces: but Theodosius, after erecting a trophy, hastened towards
Constantinople, and arrived at Thessalonica. There he was taken
dangerously ill, and expressed a desire to receive Christian
baptism. <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) Now he had been
instructed in Christian principles by his ancestors, and professed the
‘homoousian’ faith. Becoming increasingly anxious to be baptized
therefore, as his malady grew worse, he sent for the bishop of
Thessalonica, and first asked him what doctrinal views he held? The
bishop having replied, ‘that the opinion of Arius had not yet invaded
the provinces of Illyricum, nor had the novelty to which that heretic
had given birth begun to prey upon the churches in those countries; but
they continued to preserve unshaken that faith which from the beginning
was delivered by the apostles, and had been confirmed in the Nicene
Synod,’ the emperor was most gladly baptized by the bishop Ascholius;
and having recovered from his disease not many days after, he came to
Constantinople on the twenty-fourth of November, in the fifth consulate
of Gratian, and the first of his own. <span

members of the flock inviting.’ See, however, on Gregory’s episcopate at
Nazianzus, IV. 26 and note.

<span id="ii.viii.vii-p5"></span>Cf. Zosimus, IV. 39, on the dangerous
illness of Theodosius. On delayed baptism, called ‘clinic,’ see I. 39,
note 2. Evidently baptism was not thought essential to one’s title to be
called a Christian. Theodosius and Constantine were both considered
Christians and ‘professed the homoousian faith, and yet they both
postponed their baptism to what they believed to be the latest moments
of their lives.’

[Next: Gregory, finding Some Dissatisfaction about his Appointment,
abdicates the Episcopate of Constantinople. The Emperor orders
Demophilus the Arian Bishop either to assent to the 'Homoousion,' or
leave the City. He chooses the Latter.](2020172.md)
