id="ii.x.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*The Bishops of Rome.*

<span id="ii.x.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xi-p2.1"></span>After</span> Innocent, Zosimus governed the
Roman church for two years: and after him Boniface <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md) presided over it for three years. He
was succeeded by Celestinus. And this Celestinus took away the churches
from the Novatians at Rome also, and obliged Rusticula their bishop to
hold his meetings secretly in private houses. Until this time the
Novatians had flourished exceedingly in Rome, possessing many churches
there, which were attended by large congregations. But envy attacked
them also, as soon as the Roman episcopate, like that of Alexandria,
extended itself beyond the limits of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and
degenerated into its present state of secular domination. For
thenceforth the bishops would not suffer even those who agreed with them
in matters of faith to enjoy the privilege of assembling in peace, but
stripped them of all they possessed, praising them merely for these
agreements in faith. The bishops of Constantinople kept themselves free
from this \[sort of conduct\]; inasmuch as in addition to tolerating
them and permitting them to hold their assemblies within the city, as I
have already stated, <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933.md) they
treated them with every mark of Christian regard.
