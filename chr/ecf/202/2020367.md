id="iii.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Cyril directs the
Sacerdotal Office after Maximus, and the Largest Form of the Cross,
surpassing the Sun in Splendor, again appears in the Heavens, and is
visible during several Days*.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p2.1"></span>At</span> the time that Cyril administered the
church of Jerusalem after Maximus, the sign of the cross appeared in the
heavens. It shone brilliantly, not with divergent rays like a comet, but
with the concentration of a great deal of light, apparently dense and
yet transparent. Its length was about fifteen stadia from Calvary to the
Mount of Olives, and its breadth was in proportion to its length. So
extraordinary a phenomenon excited universal terror. Men, women, and
children left their houses, the market-place, or their respective
employments, and ran to the church, where they sang hymns to Christ
together, and voluntarily confessed their belief in God. The
intelligence disturbed in no little measure our entire dominions, and
this happened rapidly; for, as the custom was, there were travelers from
every part of the world, so to speak, who were dwelling at Jerusalem for
prayer, or to visit its places of interest, these were spectators of the
sign, and divulged the facts to their friends at home. The emperor was
made acquainted with the occurrence, partly by numerous reports
concerning it which were then current, and partly by a letter from
Cyril <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289) the bishop. It was said
that this prodigy was a fulfillment of an ancient prophecy contained in
the Holy Scriptures. It was the means of the conversion of many pagans
and Jews to Christianity.
