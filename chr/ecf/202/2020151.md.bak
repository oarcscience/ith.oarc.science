<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Of Basil of Cæsarea,
and Gregory of Nazianzus.* <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md)

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-p3.1"></span>Now</span> Providence opposed Didymus to
the Arians at Alexandria. But for the purpose of confuting them in other
cities, it raised up Basil of Cæsarea and Gregory of Nazianzus;
concerning these it will be reasonable to give a brief account in this
place. Indeed the universally prevalent memory of the men would be
enough as a token of their fame; and the extent of their knowledge is
sufficiently perceptible in their writings. Since, however, the exercise
of their talents was of great service to the Church, tending in a high
degree to the maintenance of the catholic faith, the nature of my
history obliges me to take particular notice of these two persons. If
any one should compare Basil and Gregory with one another, and consider
the life, morals, and virtues of each, he would find it difficult to
decide to which of them he ought to assign the pre-eminence: so equally
did they both appear to excel, whether you regard the rectitude of their
conduct, or their deep acquaintance with Greek literature and the sacred
Scriptures. In their youth they were pupils at Athens of Himerius <span
id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) and Prohæresius, <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) the most celebrated sophists of that
age: subsequently they frequented the <span id="page_111">p. 111</span>
<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-Page_111"></span>school of Libanius <span
id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) at Antioch in Syria, where they
cultivated rhetoric to the utmost. Having been deemed worthy of the
profession of sophistry, they were urged by many of their friends to
enter the profession of teaching eloquence; others would have persuaded
them to practice law: but despising both these pursuits, they abandoned
their former studies, and embraced the monastic life. Having had some
slight taste of philosophical science from him who then taught it at
Antioch, they procured Origen’s works, and drew from them the right
interpretation of the sacred Scriptures; for the fame of Origen was very
great and widespread throughout the whole world at that time; after a
careful perusal of the writings of that great man, they contended
against the Arians with manifest advantage. And when the defenders of
Arianism quoted the same author in confirmation, as they imagined, of
their own views, these two confuted them, and clearly proved that their
opponents did not at all understand the reasoning of Origen. Indeed,
although Eunomius, <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) who was then
their champion, and many others on the side of the Arians were
considered men of great eloquence, yet whenever they attempted to enter
into controversy with Gregory and Basil, they appeared in comparison
with them ignorant and illiterate. Basil being ordained to the office of
deacon, was by Meletius, bishop of Antioch, from that rank elevated to
the bishopric of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, which was his native country.
Thither he therefore hastened, fearing lest these Arian dogmas should
have infected the provinces of Pontus; and in order to counteract them,
he founded several monasteries, diligently instructed the people in his
own doctrines, and confirmed the faith of those whose minds were
wavering. Gregory being constituted bishop of Nazianzus, <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) a small city of Cappadocia over which
his own father had before presided, pursued a course similar to that
which Basil took; for he went through the various cities, and
strengthened the weak in faith. To Constantinople in particular he made
frequent visits, and by his ministrations there, comforted and assured
the orthodox believers, wherefore a short time after, by the suffrage of
many bishops, he was made bishop of the church at Constantinople. When
intelligence of the proceedings of these two zealous and devoted men
reached the ears of the emperor Valens, he immediately ordered Basil to
be brought from Cæsarea to Antioch; <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) where being arraigned before the
tribunal of the prefect, that functionary asked him ‘why he would not
embrace the emperor’s faith?’ Basil with much boldness condemned the
errors of that creed which his sovereign countenanced, and vindicated
the doctrine of the *homoousion:* and when the prefect threatened him
with death, ‘Would,’ said Basil, ‘that I might be released from the
bonds of the body for the truth’s sake.’ The prefect having exhorted him
to reconsider the matter more seriously, Basil is reported to have said,
‘I am the same to-day that I shall be to-morrow: but I wish that you had
not changed yourself.’ At that time, therefore, Basil remained in
custody throughout the day. It happened, however, not long afterwards
that Galates, the emperor’s infant son, was attacked with a dangerous
malady, so that the physicians despaired of his recovery; when the
empress Dominica, his mother, assured the emperor that she had been
greatly disquieted in her dreams by fearful visions, which led her to
believe that the child’s illness was a chastisement on account of the
ill treatment of the bishop. The emperor after a little reflection sent
for Basil, and in order to prove his faith said to him, ‘If the doctrine
you maintain is the truth, pray that my son may not die.’ ‘If your
majesty should believe as I do,’ replied Basil, ‘and the church should
be unified, the child shall live.’ To these conditions the emperor would
not agree: ‘God’s will concerning the child will be done then,’ said
Basil; as Basil said this the emperor ordered him to be dismissed; the
child, however, died shortly after. Such is an epitome of the history of
these distinguished ecclesiastics, both of whom have left us many
admirable works, some of which Rufinus says he has translated into
Latin. Basil had two brothers, Peter and Gregory; the former of whom
adopted Basil’s monastic mode of life; while the latter emulated his
eloquence in teaching, and completed after his death Basil’s treatise on
the *Six Days’ Work,* which had been left unfinished. He also pronounced
at Constantinople the funeral oration of Meletius, bishop of Antioch;
and many other orations of his are still extant.

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p4"></span>Himerius, a native of Prusias (mod.
Broussa) in Bithynia, flourished about 360 <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> as a sophist under Julian the
Apostate. He published various discourses, which, according to Photius,
contained insidious attacks on Christianity. Cf. Eunapius, p. 153, under
title *Prohæresius*; Photius, *Bibl. Cod.* 165.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[110:642](2020151.htm#fr_641.md) <span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p5"></span>Prohæresius was a native of Cæsarea in
Cappadocia, and taught in Athens a short time before Libanius. Cf.
Eunapius, *Prohæresius,* par. 129–162.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[111:643](2020151.htm#fr_642.md) <span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p6"></span>This is doubted by Valesius on the
ground that Gregory in his autobiography (in verse) says that he was
thirty years of age when he left Athens, where his friends wished him to
stay and teach rhetoric; but if he stayed at Athens until the thirtieth
year of his age, it is not likely that he could have studied with
Libanius after that time. So also Rufinus, *H. E.* II. 9.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[111:644](2020151.htm#fr_643.md) <span

<span id="fn_644"></span>[111:645](2020151.htm#fr_644.md) <span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p8"></span>Rufinus (*H. E.* II. 9) says this. But
from Gregory’s own works (*Orat.* VIII.) it appears that he was not made
bishop of Nazianzus but assistant to his father, and on the express
condition that he should not succeed his father. He was first
consecrated bishop of Sasimi by Basil the Great, from thence transferred
to Constantinople, but resigned that bishopric (V. 7) and retired to
Nazianzus, where he remained bishop until he chose his successor there.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[111:646](2020151.htm#fr_645.md) <span
id="ii.vii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.xxvi-p9"></span>Sozomen (VI. 16) says that Valens came
from Antioch to Cæsarea and ordered Basil to be brought before the
prefect of the prætorium. This account agrees better with what both
Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa say of this experience of
Basil.
