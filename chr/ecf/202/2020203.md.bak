<span id="ii.ix.xi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Epiphanius Bishop of Cyprus
convenes a Synod to condemn the Books of Origen.*

<span id="ii.ix.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xi-p2.1"></span>He</span> moreover renewed his friendship with
Epiphanius <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) bishop of Constantia
in Cyprus, with whom he had formerly been at variance. For Theophilus
accused Epiphanius of entertaining low thoughts of God, by supposing him
to have a human form. <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) Now
although Theophilus was really unchanged in sentiment, and had denounced
those who thought that the divinity was human in form, yet on account of
his hatred of others, he openly denied his own convictions; and he now
professed to be friendly with Epiphanius, as if he had altered his mind
and agreed with him in his views of God. He then managed it so that
Epiphanius by letter should convene a Synod of the bishops in Cyprus, in
order to condemn the writings of Origen. Epiphanius being on account of
his extraordinary piety a man of simple mind and manners was easily
influenced by the letters of Theophilus: having therefore assembled a
council of bishops in that island, he caused a prohibition to be therein
made of the reading of Origen’s works. He also wrote to John, exhorting
him to abstain from the study of Origen’s books, and to convoke a Synod
for decreeing the same thing as he had done. Accordingly when Theophilus
had in this way deluded Epiphanius, who was famous for his piety, seeing
his design prosper according to his wish, he became more confident, and
himself also assembled a great number of bishops. In that convention,
pursuing the same course as Epiphanius, he caused a like sentence of
condemnation to be pronounced on the writings of Origen, who had been
dead nearly two hundred years: not having this as his first object, but
rather his purpose of revenge on Dioscorus and his brethren. John paying
but little attention to the communications of Epiphanius and Theophilus,
was intent on instructing the churches; and he flourished more and more
as a preacher, but made no account of the plots which were laid against
him. As soon, however, as it became apparent to every body that
Theophilus was endeavoring to divest John of his bishopric, then all
those who had any ill-will against John, combined in calumniating him.
And thus many of the clergy, and many of those in office, and of those
who had great influence at the court, believing that they had found an
opportunity now of avenging themselves upon John, exerted themselves to
procure the convocation of a Grand Synod at Constantinople, partly by
sending letters and partly by dispatching messengers in all directions
for that purpose.

<span id="ii.ix.xi-p3"></span>There were thirty-five bishops, besides
several presbyters and laymen of some distinction in the ancient church,
who bore the name of Epiphanius. The bishop here mentioned is the most
illustrious of them all, being the author of the well-known treatise *de
Hæres.* His see—that of Constantia in Cyprus—was the old ‘Salamis’ of
[Acts xiii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.ix.xi-p3.1"></span>.

id="ii.ix.xi-p3.2"></span>

<span id="ii.ix.xi-p4"></span>It seems strange that Epiphanius should be
classed with the Anthropomorphitæ as Epiphanius himself repudiates their
views according to the testimony of Jerome. Cf. Jerome, *ad Pammachium,*
2 *et seq.* Socrates must have been imposed upon by some Origenist, as
the Origenists were accustomed to call all who condemned their views
Anthropomorphitæ. Cf. above, chap. 7.
