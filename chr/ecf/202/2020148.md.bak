<span id="ii.vii.xxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*The Deeds of Some
Holy Persons who devoted themselves to a Solitary Life*. <span
id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md)

<span id="ii.vii.xxiii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxiii-p3.1"></span>Since</span> I have referred to the
monasteries of Egypt, it may be proper here to give a brief account of
them. They were founded probably at a very early period, but were
greatly enlarged and augmented by a devout man whose name was Ammoun. In
his youth this person had an aversion to matrimony; but when some of his
relatives urged him not to contemn marriage, but to take a wife to
himself, he was prevailed upon and was married. On leading the bride
with the customary ceremonies from the banquet-room to the nuptial
couch, after their mutual friends had withdrawn, he took a book <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md) containing the epistles of the
apostles and read to his wife Paul’s Epistle to the Corinthians,
explaining to her the apostle’s admonitions to married persons. <span
id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) Adducing many external considerations
besides, he descanted on the inconveniences and discomforts attending
matrimonial intercourse, the pangs of child-bearing, and the trouble and
anxiety connected with rearing a family. He contrasted with all this the
advantages of chastity; described the liberty, and immaculate purity of
a life of continence; and affirmed that virginity places persons in the
nearest relation to the Deity. By these and other arguments of a similar
kind, he persuaded his virgin bride to renounce with him a secular life,
prior to their having any conjugal knowledge of each other. Having taken
this resolution, they retired together to the mountain of Nitria, and in
a hut there inhabited for a short time one common ascetic apartment,
without regarding their difference of sex, being according to the
apostles, ‘one in Christ.’ <span id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) But
not long after, the recent and unpolluted bride thus addressed Ammoun:
‘It is unsuitable,’ said she, ‘for you who practice chastity, to look
upon a woman in so confined a dwelling; let us therefore, if it is
agreeable to you, perform our exercise apart.’ This agreement again was
satisfactory to both, and so they separated, and spent the rest of their
lives in abstinence from wine and oil, eating dry bread alone, sometimes
passing over one day, at others fasting two, and sometimes more.
Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, asserts in his *Life of
Anthony*, <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md) that the subject of
his memoir who was contemporary with this Ammoun, saw his soul taken up
by angels after his decease. Accordingly, a great number of persons
emulated Ammoun’s manner of life, so that by degrees the mountains of
Nitria and Scitis were filled with monks, an account of whose lives
would require an express work. As, however, there were among them
persons of eminent piety, distinguished for their strict discipline and
apostolic lives, who said and did many things worthy of being recorded,
I deem it useful to interweave with my history a few particulars
selected out of the great number for the information of my readers. It
is said that Ammoun never saw himself naked, being accustomed to say
that ‘it became not a monk to see even his own person exposed.’ And when
once he wanted to pass a river, but was unwilling to undress, he
besought God to enable him to cross without his being obliged to break
his resolution; and immediately an angel transported him to the other
side of the river. Another monk named Didymus <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) lived entirely alone to the day of his
death, although he had reached the age of ninety years. Arsenius,
another of them, would not separate young delinquents from communion,
but only those that were advanced in age: ‘for,’ said he, ‘when a young
person is excommunicated he becomes hardened; but an elderly one is soon
sensible of the misery of excommunication.’ Pior was accustomed to take
his food as he walked along. As a certain one asked him, ‘Why do you eat
thus?’ ‘That I may not <span id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xxiii-Page_107"></span>seem,’ said he, ‘to make eating
serious business but rather a thing done by the way.’ To another putting
the same question he replied, ‘Lest even in eating my mind should be
sensible of corporeal enjoyment.’ Isidore affirmed that he had not been
conscious of sin even in thought for forty years; and that he had never
consented either to lust or anger. Pambos being an illiterate man went
to some one for the purpose of being taught a psalm; and having heard
the first verse of the thirty-eighth psalm, ‘I said I will take heed to
my ways, that I offend not with my tongue,’ <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) he departed without staying to hear
the second verse, saying, ‘this one will suffice, if I can practically
acquire it.’ And when the person who had given him the verse reproved
him because he had not seen him for the space of six months, he answered
that he had not yet learnt to practice the verse of the psalm. After a
considerable lapse of time, being asked by one of his friends whether he
had made himself master of the verse, his answer was, ‘I have scarcely
succeeded in accomplishing it during nineteen years.’ A certain
individual having placed gold in his hands for distribution to the poor,
requested him to reckon what he had given him. ‘There is no need of
counting,’ said he, ‘but of integrity of mind.’ This same Pambos, at the
desire of Athanasius the bishop, came out of the desert to Alexandria
and on beholding an actress there, he wept. When those present asked him
why he wept, he replied, ‘Two causes have affected me: one is the
destruction of this woman; the other is that I exert myself less to
please my God than she does to please obscene characters.’ Another said
that ‘a monk who did not work ought to be regarded as on a level with
the covetous man.’ Piterus was well-informed in many branches of natural
philosophy, and was accustomed frequently to enter into expositions of
the principles sometimes of one and sometimes of another department of
science, but he always commenced his expositions with prayer. There were
also among the monks of that period, two of the same name, of great
sanctity, each being called Macarius; one of whom was from Upper Egypt,
the other from the city of Alexandria. Both were celebrated for their
ascetic discipline, the purity of their life and conversation, and the
miracles which were wrought by their hands. The Egyptian Macarius
performed so many cures, and cast out so many devils, that it would
require a distinct treatise to record all that the grace of God enabled
him to do. His manner toward those who resorted to him was austere, yet
at the same time calculated to inspire veneration. The Alexandrian
Macarius, while in all respects resembling his Egyptian namesake,
differed from him in this, that he was always cheerful to his visitors;
and by the affability of his manners led many young men to asceticism.
Evagrius <span id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) became a disciple of
these men, acquired from them the philosophy of deeds, whereas he had
previously known that which consisted in words only. He was ordained
deacon at Constantinople by Gregory of Nazianzus, and afterwards went
with him into Egypt, where he became acquainted with these eminent
persons, and emulated their course of conduct, and miracles were done by
his hands as numerous and important as those of his preceptors. Books
were also composed by him of very valuable nature, one of which is
entitled *The Monk,* or, *On Active Virtue;* another *The
Gnostic,* <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md) or, *To him who is
deemed worthy of Knowledge:* this book is divided into fifty chapters. A
third is designated *Antirrheticus,* and contains selections from the
Holy Scriptures against tempting spirits, distributed into eight parts,
according to the number of the arguments. He wrote moreover *Six Hundred
Prognostic Problems,* and also two compositions in verse, one addressed
*To the Monks living in Communities,* and the other *To the Virgin.*
Whoever shall read these productions will be convinced of their
excellence. It will not be out of place here, I conceive, to subjoin to
what has been before stated, a few things mentioned by him respecting
the monks. These are his words: <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md)

<span id="ii.vii.xxiii-p13"></span>It becomes us to enquire into the
habits of the pious monks who have preceded us, in order that we may
correct ourselves by their example: for undoubtedly very many excellent
things have been said and done by them. One of them was accustomed to
say, that ‘a drier and not irregular diet combined with love, would
quickly conduct a monk into the haven of tranquillity.’ The same
individual freed one of his brethren from being troubled by apparitions
at night, by enjoining him to minister while fasting to the sick. And
being asked why he prescribed this: ‘Such affections,’ said he, ‘are by
nothing so effectually dissipated as by the exercise of compassion.’ A
certain philosopher of those times coming to Anthony the Just, said to
him, ‘How can you endure, father, being deprived of the comfort of
books?’ ‘My book, O philosopher,’ replied Anthony, ‘is the nature of
things that are made, and it is present whenever I wish to read the
words of God.’ That ‘chosen vessel,’ <span
id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) the aged Egyptian Macarius, asked me,
why the <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xxiii-Page_108"></span>strength of the faculty of memory is
impaired by cherishing the remembrance of injury received from men;
while by remembering those done us by devils it remains uninjured? And
when I hesitated, scarcely knowing what answer to make, and begged him
to account for it: ‘Because,’ said he, ‘the former is an affection
contrary to nature, and the latter is conformable to the nature of the
mind.’ Going on one occasion to the holy father Macarius about mid-day,
and being overcome with the heat and thirst, I begged for some water to
drink: ‘Content yourself with the shade,’ was his reply, ‘for many who
are now journeying by land, or sailing on the deep, are deprived even of
this.’ Discussing with him afterwards the subject of abstinence, ‘Take
courage, my son,’ said he: ‘for twenty years I have neither eaten,
drunk, nor slept to satiety; my bread has always been weighed, my water
measured, and what little sleep I have had has been stolen by reclining
myself against a wall.’ <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md) The
death of his father was announced to one of the monks: ‘Cease your
blasphemy,’ said he to the person that told him; ‘my father is
immortal.’ One of the brethren who possessed nothing but a copy of the
Gospels, sold it, and distributed the price in food to the hungry,
uttering this memorable saying—‘I have sold the book which says, “Sell
that thou hast and give to the poor.”’ <span
id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628.md) There is an island about the northern
part of the city of Alexandria, beyond the lake called Maria, where a
monk from Parembole <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) dwells, in
high repute among the Gnostics. This person was accustomed to say, that
all the deeds of the monks were done for one of these five reasons;—on
account of God, nature, custom, necessity, or manual labor. The same
also said that there was only one virtue in nature, but that it assumes
various characteristics according to the dispositions of the soul: just
as the light of the sun is itself without form, but accommodates itself
to the figure of that which receives it. Another of the monks said, ‘I
withdraw myself from pleasures, in order to cut off the occasions of
anger: for I know that it always contends for pleasures, disturbing my
tranquillity of mind, and unfitting me for the attainment of knowledge.’
One of the aged monks said that ‘Love knows not how to keep a deposit
either of provisions or money.’ He added, ‘I never remember to have been
twice deceived by the devil in the same thing.’ Thus wrote Evagrius in
his book entitled *Practice*. <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md)
And in that which he called *The Gnostic* he says, ‘We have learned from
Gregory the Just, that there are four virtues, having distinct
characteristics:—prudence and fortitude, temperance and justice. That it
is the province of prudence to contemplate the sacred and intelligent
powers apart from expression, because these are unfolded by wisdom: of
fortitude to adhere to truth against all opposition, and never to turn
aside to that which is unreal: of temperance to receive seed from the
chief husbandman, <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md) but to repel
him who would sow over it seed of another kind: and finally, of justice
to adapt discourse to every one, according to their condition and
capacity; stating some things obscurely, others in a figurative manner,
and explaining others clearly for the instruction of the less
intelligent.’ That pillar of truth, Basil of Cappadocia, used to say
that ‘the knowledge which men teach is perfected by constant study and
exercise; but that which proceeds from the grace of God, by the practice
of justice, patience, and mercy.’ That the former indeed is often
developed in persons who are still subject to the passions; whereas the
latter is the portion of those only who are superior to their influence,
and who during the season of devotion, contemplate that peculiar light
of the mind which illumines them. That luminary of the Egyptians, holy
Athanasius, assures us ‘that Moses was commanded to place the table on
the north <span id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md) side. Let the Gnostics
therefore understand what wind is contrary to them, and so nobly endure
every temptation, and minister nourishment with a willing mind to those
who apply to them.’ Serapion, the angel of the church of the Thmuïtae,
declared that ‘the mind is completely purified by drinking in spiritual
knowledge’: that ‘charity cures the inflammatory tendencies of the
soul’; and that ‘the depraved lusts which spring up in it are restrained
by abstinence.’ ‘Exercise thyself continually,’ said the great and
enlightened teacher Didymus, ‘in reflecting on providence and judgment;
and endeavor to bear in memory the material of whatever discourses thou
mayst have heard on these topics, for almost all fail in this respect.
Thou wilt find reasonings concerning judgment in the difference of
created forms, and the constitution of the universe: sermons on
providence comprehended in those means by which we are led from vice and
ignorance to virtue and knowledge.’

<span id="ii.vii.xxiii-p21"></span>These few extracts from Evagrius we
thought it would be appropriate to insert here. There was another
excellent man among the monks, named Ammonius, who had so little
interest in secular matters, that when he went to Rome with Athanasius,
he chose to investigate none <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xxiii-Page_109"></span>of the magnificent works of that city,
contenting himself with examining the Cathedral of Peter and Paul only.
This same Ammonius on being urged to enter upon the episcopal office,
cut off his own right ear, that by mutilation of his person he might
disqualify himself for ordination. But when long afterwards Evagrius,
whom Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, wished to make a bishop, having
effected his escape without maiming himself in any way, afterwards
happened to meet Ammonius, and told him jocosely, that he had done wrong
in cutting off his own ear, as he had by that means rendered himself
criminal in the sight of God. To which Ammonius replied, ‘And do you
think, Evagrius, that you will not be punished, who from self-love have
cut out your own tongue, to avoid the exercise of that gift of utterance
which has been committed to you?’ There were at the same time in the
monasteries very many other admirable and devout characters whom it
would be too tedious to enumerate in this place, and besides if we
should attempt to describe the life of each, and the miracles they did
by means of that sanctity with which they were endowed, we should
necessarily digress too far from the object we have in view. Should any
one desire to become acquainted with their history, in reference both to
their deeds and experiences and discourses for the edification of their
auditors, as well as how wild beasts became subject to their authority,
there is a specific treatise <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md) as
on the subject, composed by the monk Palladius, who was a disciple of
Evagrius, and gives all these particulars in minute detail. In that work
he also mentions several women, who practiced the same kind of
austerities as the men that have been referred to. Both Evagrius and
Palladius flourished a short time after the death of Valens. We must now
return to the point whence we diverged.
