<span id="ii.ix.xxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*John dies in Exile.*

<span id="ii.ix.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xxii-p2.1"></span>John</span> taken into exile died in Comana
on the Euxine, on the 14th of September, in the following <span
id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span
id="ii.ix.xxii-Page_152"></span>consulate, which was the seventh of
Honorius, and the second of Theodosius. <span
id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892.md) A man, as we have before
observed, <span id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md) who on account of zeal
for temperance was inclined rather to anger than forbearance: and his
personal sanctity of character led him to indulge in a latitude of
speech which to others was intolerable. Indeed, it is most inexplicable
to me, how with a zeal so ardent for the practice of self-control and
blamelessness of life, he should in his sermons appear to teach a loose
view of temperance. For whereas by the Synod of bishops repentance was
accepted but once from those who had sinned after baptism; he did not
scruple to say, ‘Approach, although you may have repented a thousand
times.’ <span id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) For this doctrine, many
even of his friends censured him, but especially Sisinnius bishop of the
Novatian; who wrote a book condemnatory of the above quoted expression
of Chrysostom’s, and severely rebuked him for it. But this occurred long
before. <span id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md)

<span id="ii.ix.xxii-p5"></span>These words are not found in any of
Chrysostom’s extant homilies. There is no reason, however, for thinking
that they were not uttered by him in a sermon now not in existence.
Socrates’ remarks on Chrysostom’s attitude made here are among the
considerations which have led some to think that he was a Novatian. Cf.
Introd. p. x.
