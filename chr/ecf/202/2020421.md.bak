<span id="iii.xi.v-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Athanasius the Great is
Very Highly Esteemed by the Emperor, and rules over the Churches of
Egypt. Vision of Antony the Great*.

<span id="iii.xi.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.v-p2.1"></span>At</span> this period, <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) Athanasius, who governed the see of
Alexandria, and some of his friends, deemed it requisite, as the emperor
was a Christian, to repair to his court. <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) Accordingly Athanasius went to
Antioch, and laid such matters before the emperor as he deemed
expedient. Others, however, say that the emperor sent for him in order
to consult him concerning the affairs relative to religion and the right
tenet. When the business of the Church had as far as possible been
transacted, Athanasius began to think of returning.

<span id="iii.xi.v-p5"></span>Euzoïus, bishop of the Arian heresy in
Antioch, endeavored to install Probatius, a eunuch who held the same
sentiments as himself, in Alexandria. The whole party of Euzoïus
conspired with him to effect this design; and Lucius, a citizen of
Alexandria, who had been ordained presbyter by George, endeavored to
prejudice the emperor against Athanasius, by representing <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) that he had been accused of divers
crimes and had been condemned to perpetual banishment by preceding
emperors, as the author of the dissensions and troubles of the Church
concerning the Divine Being. Lucius likewise besought Jovian to appoint
another bishop over the church of Alexandria. The emperor, since he knew
the plots which had happened against Athanasius, attached no credit to
the calumny, and with threatening, commanded Lucius to retire quietly;
he also ordered Probatius and the other eunuchs belonging to his palace,
whom he regarded as the originators of these troubles, to act more
advisedly. From that period Jovian manifested the greatest friendship
towards Athanasius, and sent him back to Egypt, with directions to
govern the churches and people of that country as he might think fit. It
is also said that he passed commendations on the virtue of the bishop,
on his life, his intellectual endowments, and his eloquence.

<span id="iii.xi.v-p7"></span>Thus, after having been exposed to
opposition for a long while, as has been narrated in the former books,
was the Nicene faith fully reestablished under the present government;
but further embarrassment awaited it within a very short period. For, as
it appeared afterwards, the whole of the prediction of Antony the Monk
was not fulfilled by the occurrences which befell the Church during the
reign of Constantius; part thereof was not accomplished until the reign
of Valens. It is said that before the Arians got control of the churches
during the reign of Constantius, Antony had a dream in which he saw
mules kicking the altar with their hoofs and overturning the holy table.
On awakening, he immediately predicted that the Church would be troubled
by the introduction of spurious and mixed doctrines, and by the
rebellion of the heterodox. The truth of this prediction was evidenced
by the events which occurred before and after the period now under
review.
