id="iii.xii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Discovery of the
Remains of the Prophets Habakkuk and Micah. Death of the Emperor
Theodosius the Great*.

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p2.1"></span>While</span> the Church everywhere was
under the sway of these eminent men, the clergy and people were excited
to the imitation of their virtue and zeal. Nor was the Church of this
era distinguished only by these illustrious examples of piety; for the
relics of the proto-prophets, <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md)
Habakkuk, and a little while after, Micah, were brought to light about
this time. As I understand, God made known the place where both these
bodies were deposited by a divine vision in a dream to Zebennus, who was
then acting as bishop of the church of Eleutheropolis. The relics of
Habakkuk were found at Cela, a city formerly called Ceila. The tomb of
Micah was discovered at a distance of ten stadia from Cela, at a place
called Berathsatia. <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) This tomb
was ignorantly styled by the people of the country, “the tomb of the
faithful”; or, in their native language, Nephsameemana. These events,
which occurred during the reign of Theodosius, were sufficient for the
good repute of the Christian religion.

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p5"></span>After conquering Eugenius, <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) Theodosius the emperor remained for
some time at Milan, and here he was attacked with a serious malady. He
recalled to mind the prediction of the monk, John, and conjectured that
his sickness was unto death. He sent in haste for his son Honorius from
Constantinople; and on seeing him by, he seemed to be easier, so that he
was able to be present at the sports of the Hippodrome. After dinner,
however, he suddenly grew worse, and sent to desire his son to preside
at the spectacle. He died on the following night. This event happened
during the consulate of the brothers Olybrius and Probianus. <span
