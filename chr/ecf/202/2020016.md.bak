<span id="ii.iv.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*The Emperor Constantine
being grieved at the Disturbance of the Churches, sends Hosius the
Spaniard to Alexandria, exhorting the Bishop and Arius to Reconciliation
and Unity.*

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>When</span> the emperor was made acquainted
with these disorders, he was very deeply grieved; and regarding the
matter as a personal misfortune, immediately exerted himself to
extinguish the conflagration which had been kindled, and sent a letter
to Alexander and Arius by a trustworthy person named Hosius, who was
bishop of Cordova, in Spain. The emperor greatly loved this man and held
him in the highest estimation. It will not be out of place to introduce
here a portion of this letter, the whole of which is given in the life
of Constantine by Eusebius. <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md)

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p4"></span>Victor Constantine Maximum Augustus to
Alexander and Arius.

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p5"></span>I am informed that your present
controversy originated thus. When you, Alexander, inquired of your
presbyters what each thought on a certain inexplicable passage of the
written Word, rather on a subject improper for discussion; and you,
Arius, rashly gave expression to a view of the matter such as ought
either never to have been conceived, or when suggested to your mind, it
became you to bury it in silence. This dispute having thus been excited
among you, communion <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) has been
denied; and the most holy people being rent into two factions, have
departed from the harmony of the common body. Wherefore let each one of
you, showing consideration for the other, listen to the impartial
exhortation of your fellow-servant. And what counsel does he offer? It
was neither prudent at first to agitate such a question, nor to reply to
such a question when proposed: for the claim of no law demands the
investigation of such subjects, but the idle useless talk of leisure
occasions them. And even if they should exist for the sake of exercising
our natural faculties, yet we ought to confine them to our own
consideration, and not incautiously bring them forth in public
assemblies, nor thoughtlessly confide them to the ears of everybody.
Indeed how few are capable either of adequately expounding, or even
accurately understanding the import of matters so vast and profound!

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p7"></span>And even if any one should be considered
able to satisfactorily accomplish this, how large a portion of the
people would he succeed in convincing? Or who can grapple with the
subtilties of such investigations without danger of lapsing into error?
It becomes us therefore on such topics to check loquacity, lest either
on account of the weakness of our nature we should be incompetent to
explain the subject proposed; or the dull understanding of the audience
should make them unable to apprehend clearly what is attempted to be
taught: and in the case of one or the other of these failures, the
people must be necessarily involved either in blasphemy or schism.
Wherefore let an unguarded question, and an inconsiderate answer, on the
part of each of you, procure equal forgiveness from one another. No
cause of difference has been started by you bearing on any important
precept contained in the Law; nor has any new heresy been introduced by
you in connection with the worship of God; but ye both hold one and the
same judgment on these points, which is the Creed. <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) Moreover, while you thus
pertinaciously contend with one another about matters of small or
scarcely the least importance, it is unsuitable for you to have charge
of so many people of God, because you are divided in opinion: <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) and not only is it unbe<span
id="page_7">p. 7</span> <span id="ii.iv.vii-Page_7"></span>coming, but
it is also believed to be altogether unlawful.

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p10"></span>In order to remind you of your duty by
an example of an inferior kind, I may say: you are well aware that even
the philosophers themselves are united under one sect. Yet they often
differ from each other on some parts of their theories: but although
they may differ on the very highest branches of science, in order to
maintain the unity of their body, they still agree to coalesce. Now, if
this is done amongst them, how much more equitable will it be for you,
who have been constituted ministers of the Most High God, to become
unanimous with one another in such a religious profession. But let us
examine with closer consideration, and deeper attention, what has been
already stated. Is it right on account of insignificant and vain
contentions between you about words, that brethren should be set in
opposition against brethren; and that the honorable communion should be
distracted by unhallowed dissension, through our striving with one
another respecting things so unimportant, and by no means essential?
These quarrels are vulgar and rather consistent with puerile
thoughtlessness, than suitable to the intelligence of priests and
prudent men. We should spontaneously turn aside from the temptations of
the devil. The great God and Saviour of us all has extended to all the
common light. Under his providence, allow me, his servant, to bring this
effort of mine to a successful issue; that by my exhortation, ministry,
and earnest admonition, I may lead you, his people, back to unity of
communion. <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) For since, as I have
said, there is but one faith among you, and one sentiment respecting
religion, <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) and since the precept
of the law, <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) in all its parts,
combines all in one purpose of soul, let not this diversity of opinion,
which has excited dissension among you, by any means cause discord and
schism, inasmuch as it does not affect the force of the law as a whole.
Now, I say these things, not as compelling you all to see exactly alike
on this very insignificant subject of controversy, whatever it may be;
since the dignity <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) of the
communion may be preserved unaffected, and the same fellowship with all
be retained, even though there should exist among you some dissimilarity
of sentiment on unimportant matters. For, of course, we do not all
desire the same thing in every respect; nor is there one unvarying
nature, or standard of judgment in us. Therefore, in regard to divine
providence, let there be one faith, one sentiment, and one covenant of
the Godhead: <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) but those minute
investigations which ye enter into among yourselves with so much nicety,
even if ye should not concur in one judgment in regard to them, should
remain within the sphere of your own reflection, kept in the secret
recesses of the mind. Let then an ineffable and select bond of general
friendship, with faith in the truth, reverence for God, and a devout
observance of his law, remain unshaken among you. Resume mutual
friendship and grace; restore to the whole people their accustomed
familiar embraces; and do ye yourselves, on the strength of having
purified your own souls, again recognize one another. For friendship
often becomes sweeter after the removal of animosity. Thus restore to me
tranquil days, and nights free from care; that to me also some pleasure
in the pure light may be preserved, and a cheerful serenity during the
rest of my life: otherwise, I must necessarily groan, and be wholly
suffused with tears; neither will the remaining period of my earthly
existence be peacefully sustained. For while the people of God (I speak
of my fellow-servants) are severed from one another by so unworthy and
injurious a contest, how is it possible for me to maintain my usual
equanimity? But in order that you may have some idea of my excessive
grief on account of this unhappy difference, listen to what I am about
to state. On my recent arrival at the city of Nicomedia, it was my
intention immediately after to proceed into the East: but while I was
hastening toward you, and had advanced a considerable distance on my
way, intelligence of this affair altogether reversed my purpose, lest I
should be obliged to see with my own eyes a condition of things such as
I could scarcely bear the report of. Open to me therefore by your
reconciliation henceforth, the way into the East, which ye have
obstructed by your contentions against one another: and permit me
speedily to behold both you and all the rest of the people rejoicing
together; and to express my due thanks to the Divine Being, because of
the general harmony and liberty of all parties, accompanied by the
cordial utterance of your praise. <span

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p16"></span>Socrates’ lack of theological training
can be inferred from his admiration for this rather superficial letter
of Constantine’s; so also the rudimentary character of Constantine’s
views of Gospel truth and his want of appreciation for the vital nature
of the question in the Arian controversy. It may be noted, however, that
the statesmanship shown in the tone and recommendations of the letter is
just as farsighted as the theology of it is superficial. Constantine had
sought to unite the empire through the church, and now that very church
threatened to disrupt the empire; and this, at the very time, when by
his final victory over Licinius and the foundation of his new capital,
he seemed to have realized the ideal of a reunited empire.
