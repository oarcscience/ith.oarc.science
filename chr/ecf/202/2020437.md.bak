id="iii.xi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*List of the Places in
which the Nicene Doctrines were Represented; Faith manifested by the
Scythians; Vetranio, the Leader of this Race*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxi-p2.1"></span>Arianism</span> met with similar opposition
at the same period in Osröene; but in the Cappadocias, Providence
allotted such a divine and most educated pair of men,—Basil, the bishop
of Cæsarea in that country, and Gregory, bishop of Nazianzen. <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) Syria and the neighboring
provinces, and more especially the city of Antioch, were plunged into
confusion and disorder; for the Arians were very numerous in these
parts, and had possession of the churches. The members of the Catholic
Church were not, however, few in number. They were called Eustathians
and Paulinists, and were under the guidance of Paulinus and Meletius, as
has been before stated. It was through their instrumentality that the
church of Antioch was preserved from the encroachments of the Arians,
and enabled to resist the zeal of the emperor and of those in power
about him. Indeed, it appears that in all the churches which were
governed by brave men, the people did not deviate from their former
opinions.

<span id="iii.xi.xxi-p4"></span>It is said that this was the cause of
the firmness with which the Scythians adhered to their <span
id="page_359">p. 359</span> <span id="iii.xi.xxi-Page_359"></span>faith.
There are in this country a great number of cities, villages, and
fortresses. The metropolis is called Tomi; it is a large and populous
city, and lies on the sea-shore to the left of one sailing to the sea,
called the Euxine.

<span id="iii.xi.xxi-p5"></span>According to an ancient custom which
still prevails, all the churches of the whole country are under the sway
of one bishop. <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xxi-p7"></span>Vetranio ruled over these churches at
the period that the emperor visited Tomi. Valens repaired to the church,
and strove, according to his usual custom, to gain over the bishop to
the heresy of Arius; but this latter manfully opposed his arguments, and
after a courageous defense of the Nicene doctrines, quitted the emperor
and proceeded to another church, whither he was followed by the people.
Almost the entire city had crowded to see the emperor, for they expected
that something extraordinary would result from this interview with the
bishop.

<span id="iii.xi.xxi-p8"></span>Valens was extremely offended at being
left alone in the church with his attendants, and in resentment,
condemned Vetranio to banishment. Not long after, however, he recalled
him, because, I believe, he apprehended an insurrection; for the
Scythians were offended at the absence of their bishop.

<span id="iii.xi.xxi-p9"></span>He well knew that the Scythians were a
courageous nation, and that their country, by the position of its
places, possessed many natural advantages which rendered it necessary to
the Roman Empire, for it served as a barrier to ward off the barbarians.

<span id="iii.xi.xxi-p10"></span>Thus was the intention of the ruler
openly frustrated by Vetranio. The Scythians themselves testify that he
was good in all other respects and eminent for the virtue of his life.

<span id="iii.xi.xxi-p11"></span>The resentment of the emperor was
visited upon all the clergy except those of the Western churches; for
Valentinian, who reigned over the Western regions, was an admirer of the
Nicene doctrines, and was imbued with so much reverence for religion,
that he never imposed any commands upon the priests, nor ever attempted
to introduce any alteration for better or for worse in ecclesiastical
regulations. Although he had become one of the best of emperors, and had
shown his capacity to rule affairs, he considered that ecclesiastical
matters were beyond the range of his jurisdiction.
