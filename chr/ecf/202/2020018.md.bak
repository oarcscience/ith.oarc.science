<span id="ii.iv.ix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*The Letter of the Synod,
relative to its Decisions: and the Condemnation of Arius and those who
agreed with him.*

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>To</span> the holy, by the grace of God, and
great church of the Alexandrians, and to our beloved brethren throughout
Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, the bishops assembled at Nicæa,
constituting the great and holy Synod, send greeting in the Lord.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p3"></span>Since, by the grace of God, a great and
holy Synod has been convened at Nicæa, our most pious sovereign
Constantine having summoned us out of various cities and provinces for
that purpose, it appeared to us indispensably necessary that a letter
should be written to you on the part of the sacred Synod; in order that
ye may know what subjects were brought under consideration and examined,
and what was eventually determined on and decreed.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p4"></span>In the first place, then, the impiety and
guilt of Arius and his adherents were examined into, in the presence of
our most religious emperor Constantine: and it was unanimously decided
that his impious opinion should be anathematized, with all the
blasphemous expressions he has uttered, in affirming that ‘the Son of
God sprang from nothing,’ and that ‘there was a time when he was not’;
saying moreover that ‘the Son of God, because possessed of free will,
was capable either of vice or virtue; and calling him a creature and a
work. All these sentiments the holy Synod has anathematized, having
scarcely patience to endure the hearing of such an impious opinion, or,
rather, madness, and such blasphemous words. But the conclusion of our
proceedings against him you must either have been informed of already or
will soon learn; for we would not seem to trample on a man who has
received the chastisement which his crime deserved. Yet so contagious
has his pestilential error proved, as to drag into perdition Theonas,
bishop of Marmarica, and Secundus of Ptolemaïs; for they have suffered
the same condemnation as himself. But when the grace of God delivered us
from those execrable dogmas, with all their impiety and blasphemy, and
from those persons, who had dared to cause discord and division among a
people previously at peace, there still remained the contumacy of
Melitius \[to be dealt with\] and those who had been ordained by him;
and we now state to you, beloved brethren, what resolution the Synod
came to on this point. It was decreed, the Synod being moved to great
clemency towards Melitius, although strictly speaking he was wholly
undeserving of favor, that he remain in his own city but exercise no
authority either to ordain or nominate for ordination; and that he
appear in no other district or city on this pretense, but simply retain
a nominal dignity. That those who had received appointments from him,
after having been confirmed by a more legitimate ordination, should be
admitted to communion on these conditions: that they should continue to
hold their rank and ministry, but regard themselves as inferior in every
respect to all those who have been ordained and established in each
place and <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ix-Page_13"></span>church by our most-honored fellow-minister,
Alexander, so that they shall have no authority to propose or nominate
whom they please, or to do anything at all without the concurrence of
some bishop of the Catholic Church who is one of Alexander’s suffragans.
On the other hand, such as by the grace of God and your prayers have
been found in no schism, but have continued in the Catholic Church
blameless, shall have authority to nominate and ordain those who are
worthy of the sacred office, <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) and
to act in all things according to ecclesiastical law and usage. When it
may happen that any of those holding preferments in the church die, then
let these who have been thus recently admitted be advanced to the
dignity of the deceased, provided that they should appear worthy, and
that the people should elect them, the bishop of Alexandria also
ratifying their choice. This privilege is conceded to all the others
indeed, but to Melitius personally we by no means grant the same
license, on account of his former disorderly conduct, and because of the
rashness and levity of his character, in order that no authority or
jurisdiction should be given him as a man liable again to create similar
disturbances. These are the things which specially affect Egypt, and the
most holy church of the Alexandrians: and if any other canon or
ordinance has been established, our Lord and most-honored
fellow-minister and brother Alexander being present with us, will on his
return to you enter into more minute details, inasmuch as he has been a
participator in whatever is transacted, and has had the principal
direction of it. We have also gratifying intelligence to communicate to
you relative to unity of judgment on the subject of the most holy feast
of Easter: for this point also has been happily settled through your
prayers; so that all the brethren in the East who have heretofore kept
this festival when the Jews did, will henceforth conform to the Romans
and to us, and to all who from the earliest time have observed our
period of celebrating Easter. Rejoicing therefore in these conclusions
and in the general unanimity and peace, as well as in the extirpation of
all heresy, receive with the greater honor and more abundant love our
fellow-minister and your bishop Alexander, who has greatly delighted us
by his presence, and even at his advanced age has undergone
extraordinary exertions in order that peace might be re-established
among you. Pray on behalf of us all, that the things decided as just may
be inviolably maintained through Almighty God, and our Lord Jesus
Christ, together with the Holy Spirit; to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p6"></span>This epistle of the Synod makes it plain
that they not only anathematized Arius and his adherents, but the very
expressions of his tenets; and that having agreed among themselves
respecting the celebration of Easter, they readmitted the heresiarch
Melitius into communion, suffering him to retain his episcopal rank, but
divesting him of all authority to act as a bishop. It is for this reason
I suppose that even at the present time the Melitians in Egypt are
separated from the church, because the Synod deprived Melitius of all
power. It should be observed moreover that Arius had written a treatise
on his own opinion which he entitled *Thalia;* but the character of the
book is loose and dissolute, similar in its style and metres to the
songs of Sotades. <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) This
production also the Synod condemned at the same time. Nor was it the
Synod alone that took the trouble to write letters to the churches
announcing the restoration of peace, but the emperor Constantine himself
also wrote personally and sent the following address to the church of
the Alexandrians.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p8"></span>The Emperor’s Letter.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p9"></span>Constantine Augustus, to the Catholic
church of the Alexandrians. Beloved brethren, hail! We have received
from Divine Providence the inestimable blessing of being relieved from
all error, and united in the acknowledgment of one and the same faith.
The devil will no longer have any power against us, since all that which
he had malignantly devised for our destruction has been entirely
overthrown from the foundations. The splendor of truth has dissipated at
the command of God those dissensions, schisms, tumults, and so to speak,
deadly poisons of discord. Wherefore we all worship one true God, and
believe that he is. But in order that this might be done, by divine
admonition I assembled at the city of Nicæa most of the bishops; with
whom I myself also, who am but one of you, and who rejoice exceedingly
in being your fellow-servant, undertook the investigation of the truth.
Accordingly, all points which seemed in consequence of ambiguity to
furnish any pretext for dissension, have been discussed and accurately
examined. And may the Divine Majesty pardon the fearful enormity of the
blasphemies which some were shamelessly uttering concerning the mighty
Saviour, our life and hope; declaring and confessing that they believe
things contrary to the divinely inspired Scriptures. While more than
three hundred bishops remarkable for their moderation and intellectual
keenness, were unanimous in their confirmation of one and the same
faith, which according to the truth and legitimate construction of the
law <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ix-Page_14"></span>of God can only be *the* faith; Arius alone
beguiled by the subtlety of the devil, was discovered to be the sole
disseminator of this mischief, first among you, and afterwards with
unhallowed purposes among others also. Let us therefore embrace that
doctrine which the Almighty has presented to us: let us return to our
beloved brethren from whom an irreverent servant of the devil has
separated us: let us go with all speed to the common body and our own
natural members. For this is becoming your penetration, faith and
sanctity; that since the error has been proved to be due to him who is
an enemy to the truth, ye should return to the divine favor. For that
which has commended itself to the judgment of three hundred bishops
cannot be other than the doctrine of God; seeing that the Holy Spirit
dwelling in the minds of so many dignified persons has effectually
enlightened them respecting the Divine will. Wherefore let no one
vacillate or linger, but let all with alacrity return to the undoubted
path of duty; that when I shall arrive among you, which will be as soon
as possible, I may with you return due thanks to God, the inspector of
all things, for having revealed the pure faith, and restored to you that
love for which ye have prayed. May God protect you, beloved brethren.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p10"></span>Thus wrote the emperor to the Christians
of Alexandria, assuring them that the exposition of the faith was
neither made rashly nor at random, but that it was dictated with much
research, and after strict investigation: and not that some things were
spoken of, while others were suppressed in silence; but that whatever
could be fittingly advanced in support of any opinion was fully stated.
That nothing indeed was precipitately determined, but all was previously
discussed with minute accuracy; so that every point which seemed to
furnish a pretext for ambiguity of meaning, or difference of opinion,
was thoroughly sifted, and its difficulties removed. In short he terms
the thought of all those who were assembled there the thought of God,
and does not doubt that the unanimity of so many eminent bishops was
effected by the Holy Spirit. Sabinus, however, the chief of the heresy
of the Macedonians, willfully rejects these authorities, and calls those
who were convened there ignorant and illiterate persons; nay, he almost
accuses Eusebius of Cæsarea himself of ignorance: nor does he reflect,
that even if those who constituted that synod had been laymen, yet as
being illuminated by God, and the grace of the Holy Spirit, they were
utterly unable to err from the truth. <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) Nevertheless, hear farther what the
emperor decreed in another circular both against Arius and those who
held his opinions, sending it in all directions to the bishops and
people.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p12"></span>Another Epistle of Constantine.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p13"></span>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to
the bishops and people.—Since Arius has imitated wicked and impious
persons, it is just that he should undergo the like ignominy. Wherefore
as Porphyry, <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) that enemy of
piety, for having composed licentious treatises against religion, found
a suitable recompense, and such as thenceforth branded him with infamy,
overwhelming him with deserved reproach, his impious writings also
having been destroyed; so now it seems fit both that Arius and such as
hold his sentiments should be denominated Porphyrians, that they may
take their appellation from those whose conduct they have imitated. And
in addition to this, if any treatise composed by Arius should be
discovered, let it be consigned to the flames, in order that not only
his depraved doctrine may be suppressed, but also that no memorial of
him may be by any means left. This therefore I decree, that if any one
shall be detected in concealing a book compiled by Arius, and shall not
instantly bring it forward and burn it, the penalty for this offense
shall be death; for immediately after conviction the criminal shall
suffer capital punishment. May God preserve you!

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p15"></span>*Another Epistle.* <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md)

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p17"></span>Constantine Augustus, to the Churches.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p18"></span>Having experienced from the flourishing
condition of public affairs, how great has been the grace of divine
power, I judged this to be an object above all things claiming my care,
that one faith, with sincere love, and uniform piety toward Almighty God
should be maintained amongst the most blessed assemblies of the Catholic
Church. But inasmuch as I perceived that this could not be firmly and
permanently established, unless all, or at least the greatest part of
the bishops could be convened in the same place, and every point of our
most holy religion should be discussed by them in council; therefore as
many as possible were assembled, and I myself also as one of you was
present; for I will not deny what I especially rejoice in, that I am
your fellow-servant. All points were then minutely investigated, until a
decision acceptable to Him who is the inspector of all things, was
published for the promotion of uni<span id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ix-Page_15"></span>formity of judgment and practice; so that
nothing might be henceforth left for dissension or controversy in
matters of faith. There also the question having been considered
relative to the most holy day of Easter, it was determined by common
consent that it should be proper that all should celebrate it on one and
the same day everywhere. For what can be more appropriate, or what more
solemn, than that this feast from which we have received the hope of
immortality, should be invariably kept in one order, and for an obvious
reason among all? And in the first place, it seemed very unworthy of
this most sacred feast, that we should keep it following the custom of
the Jews; a people who having imbrued their hands in a most heinous
outrage, have thus polluted their souls, and are deservedly blind.
Having then cast aside their usage, we are free to see to it that the
celebration of this observance should occur in future in the more
correct order which we have kept from the first day of the Passion until
the present time. Therefore have nothing in common with that most
hostile people the Jews. We have received from the Saviour another way;
for there is set before us both a legitimate and accurate course in our
holy religion: unanimously pursuing this, let us, most honored brethren,
withdraw ourselves from that detestable association. For it is truly
absurd for them to boast that we are incapable of rightly observing
these things without their instruction. For on what subject will they be
competent to form a correct judgment, who after that murder of their
Lord, having been bereft of their senses, are led not by any rational
motive, but by an ungovernable impulse, wherever their innate fury may
drive them? Thence it is therefore, that even in this particular they do
not perceive the truth, so that they constantly erring in the utmost
degree, instead of making a suitable correction, celebrate the Feast of
Passover a second time in the same year. <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) Why then should we follow the example
of those who are acknowledged to be infected with grievous error? Surely
we should never suffer Easter to be kept twice in one and the same year!
But even if these considerations were not laid before you, it became
your prudence at all times to take heed, both by diligence and prayer,
that the purity of your soul should in nothing have communion, or seem
to do so with the customs of men so utterly depraved. Moreover this
should also be considered, that in a matter so important and of such
religious significance, the slightest disagreement is most irreverent.
For our Saviour left us but one day to be observed in commemoration of
our deliverance, that is the day of his most holy Passion: he also
wished his Catholic Church to be one; the members of which, however much
they may be scattered in various places, are notwithstanding cherished
by one Spirit, that is by the will of God. Let the prudence consistent
with your sacred character consider how grievous and indecorous it is,
that on the same days some should be observing fasts, while others are
celebrating feasts; and after the days of Easter some should indulge in
festivities and enjoyments, and others submit to appointed fastings. On
this account therefore Divine Providence directed that an appropriate
correction should be effected, and uniformity of practice established,
as I suppose you are all aware.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p20"></span>Since then it was desirable that this
should be so amended that we should have nothing in common with that
nation of parricides, and of those who slew their Lord; and since the
order is a becoming one which is observed by all the churches of the
western, southern, and northern parts, and by some also in the eastern;
from these considerations for the present all thought it to be proper,
and I pledged myself that it would be satisfactory to your prudent
penetration, that what is observed with such general unanimity of
sentiment in the city of Rome, throughout Italy, Africa, all Egypt,
Spain, France, Britain, Libya, the whole of Greece, and the dioceses of
Asia, Pontus, and Cilicia, your intelligence also would cheerfully
accept; reflecting too that not only is there a greater number of
churches in the places before mentioned, but also that this in
particular is a most sacred obligation, that all should in common desire
whatever strict reason seems to demand, and what has no communion with
the perjury of the Jews. But to sum up matters briefly, it was
determined by common consent that the most holy festival of Easter
should be solemnized on one and the same day; for it is not even seemly
that there should be in such a hallowed solemnity any difference: and it
is more commendable to adopt that opinion in which there will be no
intermixture of strange error, or deviation from what is right. These
things therefore being thus consistent, do you gladly receive this
heavenly and truly divine command: for whatever is done in the sacred
assemblies of the bishops is referable to the Divine will. Wherefore,
when ye have indicated the things which have been prescribed to all our
beloved brethren, it behooves you to publish the above written
statements and to accept the reasoning which has been adduced, and to
establish this observance of the most holy day: that when I arrive at
the long and earnestly desired view of your order, I may be able to
<span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ix-Page_16"></span>celebrate the sacred festival with you on
one and the same day; and may rejoice with you for all things, in seeing
Satanic cruelty frustrated by divine power through our efforts, while
your faith, peace and concord are everywhere flourishing. May God
preserve you, beloved brethren.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p21"></span>*Another Epistle to Eusebius.* <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md)

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p23"></span>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to
Eusebius.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p24"></span>Since an impious purpose and tyranny have
even to the present time persecuted the servants of God our Saviour, I
have been credibly informed and am fully persuaded, most beloved
brother, that all our sacred edifices have either by neglect gone to
decay, or from dread of impending danger have not been adorned with
becoming dignity. But now that liberty has been restored, and that
persecuting dragon Licinius has by the providence of the Most High God,
and our instrumentality, been removed from the administration of public
affairs, I imagine that the divine power has been made manifest to all,
and at the same time that those who either through fear or unbelief fell
into any sins, having acknowledged the living God, will come to the true
and right course of life. Wherefore enjoin the churches over which you
yourself preside, as well as the other bishops presiding in various
places, together with the presbyters and deacons whom you know, to be
diligent about the sacred edifices, either by repairing those which
remain standing, or enlarging them, or by erecting new ones wherever it
may be requisite. And do you yourself ask, and the rest through you, the
necessary supplies both from the governors of the provinces, and the
officers of the prætorian prefecture: for directions have been given to
them to execute with all diligence the orders of your holiness. May God
preserve you, beloved brother.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p25"></span>These instructions, concerning the
building of churches were sent by the emperor to the bishops in every
province: but what he wrote to Eusebius of Palestine respecting the
preparation of some copies of the Scriptures, we may ascertain from the
letters themselves: <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md)

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p27"></span>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to
Eusebius of Cæsarea.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p28"></span>In the city which derives its name from
us, a very great multitude of persons, through the assisting providence
of our Saviour God, have united themselves to the most holy Church, so
that it has received much increase there. It is therefore requisite that
more churches should be furnished in that place: wherefore do you most
cordially enter into the purpose which I have conceived. I have thought
fit to intimate this to your prudence, that you should order to be
transcribed on well-prepared parchment, by competent writers accurately
acquainted with their art, fifty copies of the Sacred Scriptures, both
legibly described, and of a portable size, the provision and use of
which you know to be needful for the instruction of the Church. Letters
have also been despatched from our clemency, to the financial
agent <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) of the diocese that he be
careful to provide all things necessary for the preparation of them.
That these copies may be got ready as quickly as possible, let it be a
task for your diligence: and you are authorized, on the warrant of this
our letter, to use two of the public carriages for their conveyance; for
thus the copies which are most satisfactorily transcribed, may be easily
conveyed for our inspection, one of the deacons of your church
fulfilling this commission; who when he has reached us shall experience
our bounty. May God preserve you, beloved brother.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p30"></span>*Another Epistle to Macarius.* <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md)

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p32"></span>Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to
Macarius of Jerusalem.—Such is the grace of our Saviour, that no supply
of words seems to be adequate to the expression of its present
manifestation. For that the monument <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) of his most holy passion, long since
hidden under the earth, should have lain concealed for a period of so
many years, until, through the destruction of the common enemy of
all, <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) it should shine forth to
his own servants after their having regained their freedom, exceeds all
admiration. For if all those who throughout the whole habitable earth
are accounted wise, should be convened in one and the same place,
desiring to say something worthy of the event, they would fall
infinitely short of the least part of it; for the apprehension of this
wonder as far transcends every nature capable of human reasoning, as
heavenly things are mightier than human. Hence therefore this is always
my especial aim, that as the credibility of the truth daily demonstrates
itself by fresh miracles, so the souls of us all should become more
diligent respecting the holy <span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span
id="ii.iv.ix-Page_17"></span>law, with modesty and unanimous eagerness.
But I desire that you should be fully aware of what I conceive is pretty
generally known, that it is now my chief care, that we should adorn with
magnificent structures that hallowed spot, which by God’s appointment I
have disencumbered of a most disgraceful addition <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) of an idol, as of some grievous
burden; which was consecrated indeed from the beginning in the purpose
of God, but has been more manifestly sanctified since he has brought to
light the evidence of the Saviour’s passion. Wherefore it is becoming
your prudence to make such arrangements, and provision of everything
necessary, that not only a church <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) should be built in itself superior to
any elsewhere, but that the rest of its parts also may be such that all
the most splendid edifices in every city may be excelled by this. With
regard to the workmanship and chaste execution of the walls, know that
we have entrusted the care of these things to our friend Dracilian,
deputy to the most illustrious prefects of the prætorium, and to the
governor of the province: for my piety has ordered that artificers and
workmen, and whatever other things they may be informed from your
sagacity to be necessary for the structure, shall through their care be
immediately sent. Respecting the columns or the marbles, whatever you
may judge to be more precious and useful, do you yourself after having
inspected the plan take care to write to us; that when we shall
understand from your letter how many things and of what kind there may
be need of, these may be conveyed to you from all quarters: for it is
but just that the most wonderful place in the world, should be adorned
in accordance with its dignity. But I wish to know from you, whether you
consider that the vault of the basilica should be fretted, or
constructed on some other plan: for if it is to be fretted, it can also
be decorated with gold. It remains that your holiness should inform the
officers before mentioned as soon as possible, how many workmen and
artificers, and what money for expenses you will want. Be careful at the
same time to report to me speedily, not only concerning the marbles and
columns, but also concerning the fretted vault, if indeed you should
decide this to be the more beautiful. May God preserve you, beloved
brother.

<span id="ii.iv.ix-p37"></span>The emperor having also written other
letters of a more oratorical character against Arius and his adherents,
caused them to be everywhere published throughout the cities, exposing
him to ridicule, and taunting him with irony. Moreover, writing to the
Nicomedians against Eusebius and Theognis, he censures the misconduct of
Eusebius, not only on account of his Arianism, but because also having
formerly been well-affected to the ruler, he had traitorously conspired
against his affairs. He then exhorts them to elect another bishop
instead of him. But I thought it would be superfluous to insert here the
letters respecting these things, because of their length: those who wish
to do so may find them elsewhere and give them a perusal. This is
sufficient notice of these transactions.

id="ii.iv.ix-p29.1"></span>διοικήσεως καθολικόν</span>: this office was
peculiar to the Eastern Church. The nearest equivalent to it in the
terminology of the Western Church is that of vicar-general; but as the
non-technical expression ‘financial agent’ describes the official to the
modern reader, it has been adopted in the present translation.
Concerning the office, cf. Euseb. *H. E.* VII. 10. It may be also noted
that the very common ecclesiastical term diocese (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.ix-p29.2"></span>διοίκησις</span> )
originated during the reign of Constantine, as becomes evident from his
letters. See Euseb. *Life of Const.* III. 36.
