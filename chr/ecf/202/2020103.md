id="ii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Of Lucifer and Eusebius.*

<span id="ii.vi.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.v-p2.1"></span>About</span> the same time Lucifer and
Eusebius <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471) were by an imperial
order, recalled from banishment out of the Upper Thebaïs; the former
being bishop of Carala, a city of Sardinia, the latter of Vercellæ, a
city of the Ligurians in Italy, as I have said <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472) previously. These two prelates
therefore consulted together on the most effectual means of preventing
the neglected canons <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473) and
discipline of the church from being in future violated and despised.

recalled from exile by Julian’s edict, and joined Lucifer and Eusebius
in these deliberations about restoring the authority of the canons and
correcting abuses in the church.
