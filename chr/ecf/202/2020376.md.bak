id="iii.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*Letter of the Emperor
Constantius against Eudoxius and his Partisans*.

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.xiv-p2.1"></span>Constantius Augustus</span> the Conqueror,
to the holy church in Antioch. <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p4"></span>“Eudoxius came without our authority;
let no one suppose that he had it, for we are far from regarding such
persons with favor. If they have recourse to deceit with others in
transactions like this, they give evidence that they will refine away
the truth in still higher things. For from what will they voluntarily
refrain, who, for the sake of power, follow the round of the cities,
leaping from one to another, as a kind of wanderer, prying into every
nook, led by the desire for more? It is reported that there are among
these people certain quacks and sophists, whose very names are scarcely
to be tolerated, and whose deeds are evil and most impious. You all know
to what set of people I allude; for you are all thoroughly acquainted
with the doctrines of Aëtius and the heresy which he has cultivated. He
and his followers have devoted themselves exclusively to the task of
corrupting the people; and these clever fellows have had the audacity to
publish that we approved of their ordination. Such is the report they
circulate, after the manner of those who talk overmuch; but it is not
true, and, indeed, far removed from the truth. Recall to your
recollection the words of which we made use, when we first made a
declaration of our belief; for we confessed that our Saviour is the Son
of God, and of like substance with the Father. But these people, who
have the audacity to set forth whatever enters their imagination,
concerning the Godhead, are not far removed from atheism; and they
strive, moreover, to propagate their opinions among others. We are
convinced that their iniquitous proceedings will fall back upon their
own heads. In the meantime, it is sufficient to eject them from synods
and from ordinary conference; for I will not now allude to the
chastisements which must hereafter overtake them, unless they will
desist from their madness. How great is the evil they perpetrate, when
they collect together the most wicked persons, as if by an edict, and
they select the leaders of heresy for the clergy, thus debasing the
reverend order as though they were allowed to do what they please! Who
can bear with people who fill the cities with impiety, who secrete
impurity in the most distant regions, and who delight in nothing but in
injuring the righteous? What an evil-working unity it is, which limps
forward to enthrone itself in the diviner seats! Now is the time for
those who have imbibed the truth to come forward into the light, and
whoever were previously restrained through fear, and now would escape
from conventionalism, let them step into the middle; for the artifices
of these evil men have been thoroughly confuted, and no sort of device
can be invented which will deliver them from acting impiously. It is the
duty of good men to retain the faith of the Fathers, and, so to speak,
to augment it, without busying themselves with other matters. I
earnestly exhort those who have escaped, though but recently, from the
precipice of this heresy, to assent to the decrees which the bishops who
are wise in divine learning, have rightly determined for the better.”

<span id="iii.ix.xiv-p5"></span>Thus we see that the heresy usually
denominated Anomian was within a little of becoming predominant at this
period.
