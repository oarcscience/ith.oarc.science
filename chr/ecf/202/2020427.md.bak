<span id="iii.xi.xi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*The Confession of
Eustathius, Silvanus, and Theophilus, the Deputies of the Macedonians,
to Liberius, Bishop of Rome*.

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xi-p2.1"></span>To</span> Liberius, our Lord and Brother, and
Fellow-minister—Eustathius, Silvanus, and Theophilus send greeting in
the Lord. <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md)

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p4"></span>“On account of the mad opinions of the
heretics who do not cease to keep on sowing scandals for the Catholic
churches, we who nul<span id="page_353">p. 353</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xi-Page_353"></span>lify their every attack confess the Synod
which was held at Lampsacus, the one at Smyrna and the councils held in
other places, by the orthodox bishops. We have furnished letters and
sent on an embassy to your Goodness, as likewise to all the other
bishops of Italy and of the West, to confirm and preserve the Catholic
faith, which was established at the holy council of Nicæa, by the
blessed Constantine and three hundred and eighteen God-fearing fathers.

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p5"></span>“This remains, by an unmixed and
immovable settlement, until now, and will remain perpetually; in which
the term ‘consubstantial’ is fixed in all holiness and piety in
testimony against the perverseness of Arius. We confess, each with his
own hand, that we with the aforesaid have always held this same faith,
that we still hold it, and that we shall adhere to it to the last. We
condemn Arius, his impious dogmas, and his disciples. We also condemn
the heresies of Patropasianus, <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) of Photinus, of Marcellus, of Paul
of Samosata, and all who maintain such doctrines themselves. We
anathematize all heresies opposed to the aforesaid faith established by
the saintly fathers at Nicæa. We anathematize Arius especially, and
condemn all such decrees as were enacted at Ariminum, in opposition to
the aforesaid faith established by the holy council of Nicæa. We were
formerly deluded by the guile and perjury of certain parties, and
subscribed to these decrees when they were transmitted to Constantinople
from Nicæa, a city of Thrace.”

<span id="iii.xi.xi-p7"></span>After this confession they subjoined a
copy of the entire formulary of Nicæa to their own creed, and, having
received from Liberius a written account of all that they had
transacted, they sailed to Sicily.

be held in Cilicia is dissolved by Valens. The Persecution at that Time.
Athanasius the Great flees again, and is in Concealment; by the Letter
of Valens he reappears, and governs the Churches in Egypt.](2020428.md)
