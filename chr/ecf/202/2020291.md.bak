<span id="iii.vi.xv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*The Arian Heresy, its
Origin, its Progress, and the Contention which it occasioned among the
Bishops*.

<span id="iii.vi.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xv-p2.1"></span>Although</span>, as we have shown, religion
was in a flourishing condition at this period, yet the churches were
disturbed by sore contentions; for under the pretext of piety and of
seeking the more perfect discovery of God, certain questions were
agitated, which had not, till then, been examined. Arius <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) was the originator of these
disputations. He was a presbyter of the church at Alexandria in Egypt,
and was at first a zealous thinker about doctrine, and upheld the
innovations of Melitius. Eventually, however, he abandoned this latter
opinion, <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) and was ordained
deacon by Peter, bishop of Alexandria, who afterwards cast him out of
the church, because when Peter anathematized the zealots of Melitius and
rejected their baptism, Arius assailed him for these acts and could not
be restrained in quietness. After the martyrdom of Peter, Arius asked
forgiveness of Achillas, and was restored to his office as deacon, and
afterwards elevated to the presbytery. Afterwards Alexander, also, held
him in high repute, since he was a most expert logician; for it was said
that he was not lacking in such knowledge. He fell into absurd
discourses, so that he had the audacity to preach in the church what no
one before him had ever suggested; namely, that the Son of God was made
out of that which had no prior existence, that there was a period of
time in which he existed not; that, as possessing free will, he was
capable of vice and virtue, and that he was created and made: to these,
many other similar assertions were added as he went forward into the
arguments and the details of inquiry. Those who heard these doctrines
advanced, blamed Alexander for not opposing the innovations at variance
with doctrine. But this bishop deemed it more advisable to leave each
party to the free discussion of doubtful topics, so that by persuasion
rather than by force, they might cease from contention; hence he sat
down as a judge with some of his clergy, and led both sides into a
discussion. But it happened on this occasion, as is generally the case
in a strife of words, that each party claimed the victory. Arius
defended his assertions, but the others contended that the Son is
consubstantial and co-eternal with the Father. The council was convened
a second time, and the same points contested, but they came to no
agreement amongst themselves. During the debate, Alexander seemed to
incline first to one party and then to the other <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) ; finally, however, he declared
himself in favor of those who affirmed that the Son was consubstantial
and co-eternal with the Father, and he commanded Arius to receive this
doctrine, and to reject his former opinions. Arius, however, would not
be persuaded to compliance, and many of the bishops and clergy
considered his statement of doctrine to be correct. Alexander,
therefore, ejected him and the clergy who concurred with him in
sentiment from the church. Those of the parish of Alexandria, who had
embraced his opinions, were the presbyters Aithalas, Achillas, Carpones,
Sarmates, and Arius, <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) and the
deacons Euzoïus, Macarius, Julius, Menas, and Helladius. Many of the
people, likewise, sided with them: some, because they imagined their
doctrines to be of God; others, as frequently happens in similar cases,
because they believed them to have <span id="page_252">p. 252</span>
<span id="iii.vi.xv-Page_252"></span>been ill-treated and unjustly
excommunicated. Such being the state of affairs at Alexandria, the
partisans of Arius, deeming it prudent to seek the favor of the bishops
of other cities, sent legations to them; they sent a written statement
of their doctrines to them, requesting them that, if they considered
such sentiments to be of God, they would signify to Alexander that he
ought not to molest them; but that if they disapproved of the doctrines,
they should teach them what opinions were necessary to be held. This
precaution was of no little advantage to them; for their tenets became
thus universally disseminated, and the questions they had started became
matters of debate among all the bishops. Some wrote to Alexander,
entreating him not to receive the partisans of Arius into communion
unless they repudiated their opinions, while others wrote to urge a
contrary line of conduct. When Alexander perceived that many who were
revered by the appearance of good conduct, and weighty by the
persuasiveness of eloquence, held with the party of Arius, and
particularly Eusebius, president of the church of Nicomedia, a man of
considerable learning and held in high repute at the palace; he wrote to
the bishops of every church desiring them not to hold communion with
them. This measure kindled the zeal of each party the more, and as might
have been expected, the contest was increasingly agitated. Eusebius and
his partisans had often petitioned Alexander, but could not persuade
him; so that considering themselves insulted, they became indignant and
came to a stronger determination to support the doctrine of Arius. A
synod having been convened in Bithynia, they wrote to all the bishops,
desiring them to hold communion with the Arians, as with those making a
true confession, and to require Alexander to hold communion with them
likewise. As compliance could not be extorted from Alexander, Arius sent
messengers to Paulinas, bishop of Tyre, to Eusebius Pamphilus, who
presided over the church of Cæsarea in Palestine, and to Patrophilus,
bishop of Scythopolis, soliciting permission for himself and for his
adherents, as they had previously attained the rank of presbyters, to
form the people who were with them into a church. For it was the custom
in Alexandria, as it still is in the present day, that all the churches
should be under one bishop, but that each presbyter should have his own
church, in which to assemble the people. These three bishops, in
concurrence with others who were assembled in Palestine, granted the
petition of Arius, and permitted him to assemble the people as before;
but enjoined submission to Alexander, and commanded Arius to strive
incessantly to be restored to peace and communion with him.
