<span id="ii.ix.xvii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*Sedition on Account of
John Chrysostom’s Banishment. He is recalled.*

<span id="ii.ix.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> people then became intolerably
tumultuous; and as it frequently happens in such cases, many who before
were adversely disposed against him, now changed their hostility into
compassion, and said of him whom they had so recently desired to see
deposed, that he had been traduced. By this means therefore they became
very numerous who exclaimed against both the emperor and the Synod of
bishops; but the origin of the intrigue they more particularly referred
to Theophilus. For his fraudulent conduct could no longer be concealed,
being exposed by many other indications, and especially by the fact of
his having held communion with Dioscorus, and those termed ‘the Tall
Monks,’ <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) immediately after John’s
deposition. But Severian preaching in the church, and thinking it a
suitable occasion to declaim against John, said: ‘If John had been
condemned for nothing else, yet the haughtiness of his demeanor was a
crime sufficient to justify his deposition. Men indeed are forgiven all
other sins: but “God resisteth the proud,” <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) as the Divine Scriptures teach us.’
These reproaches made the people still more inclined to opposition; so
that the emperor gave orders for his immediate recall. Accordingly Briso
a eunuch in the service of the empress <span
id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) was sent after him, who finding him at
Prænetum—a commercial town situated over against Nicomedia—brought him
back toward Constantinople. And as he had been recalled, John refused to
enter the city, declaring he would not do so until his innocence had
been admitted by a higher tribunal. Thus he remained at a suburb called
Marianæ. Now as he delayed at that place the commotion increased, and
caused the people to break forth into very indignant and opprobrious
language against their rulers, wherefore to check their fury John was
constrained to proceed. On his way a vast multitude, with veneration and
honor, conducted him immediately to the church; there they entreated him
to seat himself in the episcopal chair, and give them his accustomed
benediction. When he sought to excuse himself, saying that ‘this ought
to be brought about by an order from his judges, and that those who
condemned him must first revoke their sentence,’ they were only the more
inflamed with the desire of seeing him reinstated, and of hearing him
address them again. The people finally prevailed on him to resume his
seat, and pray as usual for peace upon them; after which, acting under
the same constraint, he preached to them. This compliance on John’s part
afforded his adversaries another ground of crimination; but respecting
this they took no action at that time.
