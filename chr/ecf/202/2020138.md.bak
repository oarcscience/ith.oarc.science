<span id="ii.vii.xiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*Eunomius separates
from Eudoxius; a Disturbance is raised at Alexandria by Eudoxius, and
Athanasius flees into Voluntary Exile again, but in Consequence of the
Clamors of the People the Emperor recalls and re-establishes him in his
See.*

<span id="ii.vii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xiii-p2.1"></span>About</span> the same time Eunomius <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md) separated himself from Eudoxius, and
held assemblies apart, because after he had repeatedly entreated that
his preceptor Aëtius might be received into communion, Eudoxius
continued to oppose it. Now Eudoxius did this against his preference,
for he did not reject the opinion with Aëtius since it was the same as
his own; <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md) but he yielded to the
prevailing sentiment of his own party, who objected to Aëtius as
heterodox. This was the cause of the division between Eunomius and
Eudoxius, and such was the state of things at Constantinople. But the
church at Alexandria was disturbed by an edict of the prætorian
prefects, sent hither by means of Eudoxius. Whereupon Athanasius,
dreading the irrational impetuosity of the multitude, and fearing lest
he should be regarded as the author of the excesses that might be
committed, concealed himself for four entire months in an ancestral
tomb. Inasmuch however as the people, on account of their affection for
him, became seditious in impatience of his absence, the emperor, on
ascertaining that on this account agitation prevailed at Alexandria,
ordered by his letters that Athanasius should be suffered to preside
over the churches without molestation; and this was the reason why the
Alexandrian church enjoyed tranquillity until the death of Athanasius.
How the Arian faction became possessed of the churches after his
decease, we shall unfold in the course of our history. <span

<span id="ii.vii.xiii-p3"></span>Eunomius adopted the standpoint and
also the views of Aëtius and gave them his own name. Briefly his
fundamental principle was that the Son is absolutely unlike the Father
in substance, and hence a creature among other creatures, a mere man.
