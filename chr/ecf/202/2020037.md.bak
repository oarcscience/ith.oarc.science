id="ii.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*On Account of the
Charges against Athanasius, the Emperor convokes a Synod of Bishops at
Tyre.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor had ordered a Synod of
bishops to be present at the consecration of the church which he had
erected at Jerusalem. He therefore directed that, as a secondary matter,
they should on their way first assemble at Tyre, to examine into the
charges against Athanasius; in order that all cause of contention being
removed there, they might the more peacefully perform the inaugural
ceremonies <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) in the dedication of
the church of God. This was the thirtieth year of Constantine’s reign,
and sixty bishops were thus convened at Tyre from various places, on the
summons of Dionysius the consul. As to Macarius the presbyter, he was
conducted from Alexandria in chains, under a military escort; while
Athanasius was unwilling to go thither, not so much from dread, because
he was innocent of the charges made, as because he feared lest any
innovations should be made on the decisions of the council at Nicæa; he
was, however, constrained to be present by the menacing letters of the
emperor. For it had been written him that if he did not come
voluntarily, he should be brought by force.
