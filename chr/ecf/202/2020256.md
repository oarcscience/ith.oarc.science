<span id="ii.x.xxxix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX</span>.—*Preservation of the
Church of the Novatians from Fire.*

<span id="ii.x.xxxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxix-p2.1"></span>A little</span> while after this, Paul
bishop of the Novatians acquired the reputation of a man truly beloved
of God in a greater measure than he had before. For a terrible
conflagration having broken out at Constantinople, such as had never
happened before,—for the fire destroyed the greater part of the city,—as
the largest of the public granaries, the Achillean bath, <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025) and everything else in the way of
the fire were being consumed, it at length approached the church of the
Novatians situated near Pelargus. When the bishop Paul saw the church
endangered, he ran upon the altar, where he commended to God the
preservation of the church and all it contained; nor did he cease to
pray not only for it, but also for the city. And God heard him, as the
event clearly proved: for although the fire entered this oratory through
all its doors and windows, it did no damage. And while many adjacent
edifices fell a prey to the devouring element, the church itself was
seen unscathed in the midst of the whole conflagration triumphing over
its raging flames. This went on for two days and two nights, when the
fire was extinguished, after it had burnt down a great part of the city:
but the church remained entire, and what is more marvelous still, there
was not the slightest trace even of smoke to be observed either on its
timbers or its walls. This occurred on the 17th of August, in the
fourteenth consulate of Theodosius, which he bore together with
Maximus. <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026) Since that time the
Novatians annually celebrate the preservation of their church, on the
17th of August, by special thanksgivings to God. And almost all men,
Christians and most of the pagans from that time forth continue to
regard that place with veneration as a peculiarly consecrated spot,
because of the miracle which was wrought for its safeguard. So much
concerning these affairs.
