<span id="ii.vi.ix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*After the Synod of
Alexandria, Eusebius proceeding to Antioch finds the Catholics at
Variance on Account of Paulinus’ Consecration; and having exerted
himself in vain to reconcile them, he departs; Indignation of Lucifer
and Origin of a Sect called after him.*

<span id="ii.vi.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.ix-p2.1"></span>As</span> soon as the council of Alexandria
was dissolved, Eusebius bishop of Vercellæ went from Alexandria to
Antioch; there finding that Paulinus had been ordained by Lucifer, and
that the people were disagreeing among themselves,—for the partisans of
Meletius held their assemblies apart,—he was exceedingly grieved at the
want of harmony concerning this election, and in his own mind
disapproved of what had taken <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="ii.vi.ix-Page_84"></span>place. His respect for Lucifer however
induced him to be silent about it, and on his departure he engaged that
all things should be set right by a council of bishops. Subsequently he
labored with great earnestness to unite the dissentients, but did not
succeed. Meanwhile Meletius returned from exile; and finding his
followers holding their assemblies apart from the others, he set himself
at their head. But Euzoïus, the chief of the Arian heresy, had
possession of the churches: Paulinus <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) only retained a small church within
the city, from which Euzoïus had not ejected him, on account of his
personal respect for him. But Meletius assembled his adherents without
the gates of the city. It was under these circumstances that Eusebius
left Antioch at that time. When Lucifer understood that his ordination
of Paul was not approved of by Eusebius, regarding it as an insult, he
became highly incensed; and not only separated himself from communion
with him, but also began, in a contentious spirit, to condemn what had
been determined by the Synod. These things occurring at a season of
grievous disorder, alienated many from the church; for many attached
themselves to Lucifer, and thus a distinct sect arose under the name of
‘Luciferians.’ <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) Nevertheless
Lucifer was unable to give full expression to his anger, inasmuch as he
had pledged himself by his deacon to assent to whatever should be
decided on by the Synod. Wherefore he adhered to the tenets of the
church, and returned to Sardinia to his own see: but such as at first
identified themselves with his quarrel, still continue separate from the
church. Eusebius, on the other hand, traveling throughout the Eastern
provinces like a good physician, completely restored those who were weak
in the faith, instructing and establishing them in ecclesiastical
principles. After this he passed over to Illyricum, and thence to Italy,
where he pursued a similar course.
