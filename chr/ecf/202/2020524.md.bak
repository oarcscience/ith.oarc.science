<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*Rebellion of Attalus
and his General Heraclean; and how he eventually craved Forgiveness at
the Feet of Honorius*.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.viii-p2.1"></span>After</span> having sent some bishops as
ambassadors, on two different occasions, to treat on this subject, but
without effect, Alaric returned to Rome, and besieged the city; he took
possession of one part of Portus, and compelled the Romans to recognize
Attalus, then prefect of the city, as their king. <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) When the Romans had been nominated
for the other offices, Alaric was appointed general of the cavalry and
infantry, and Ataulphus, the brother of his wife, was raised to the
command of the force called the domestic cavalry. Attalus assembled the
senators, and addressed them in a long and very elaborate discourse, in
which he promised to restore the ancient customs of the senate, and also
to bring Egypt and the other Eastern provinces under the sway of Italy.
Such was the boastfulness of a man, who was not destined to bear the
name of sovereign during the space of a single year. He was deceived by
the representations of some diviners, who assured him that he would be
able to conquer Africa without a battle; he disobeyed Alaric, who urged
him to send a moderate force to Carthage, to slay the officers of
Honorius, in case of their attempting any resistance. He also refused to
follow the counsels of John, to whom he had given the command of the
royal cohorts about his own person, and who advised him to entrust
Constans, on his proposed departure for Libya, with a document which
they call edict, as though sent by Honorius, by which Heraclean might be
dispossessed of office; he had been entrusted with the rule of the
soldiers in Africa. Had this artifice been adopted, it would probably
have proved successful, for the designs of Attalus were unknown in
Libya. But as soon as Constans had set sail for Carthage, according to
the advice of the diviners, Attalus was so weak in mind that he did not
think it doubtful, but believed that the Africans would be his subjects,
according to the prediction of the diviners, and marched at the head of
his army towards Ravenna. When it was announced that Attalus had reached
Ariminum, with an army composed partly of Roman and partly of barbarian
troops, Honorius wrote to him to acknowledge him as emperor, and deputed
the highest officers of his <span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="iii.xiv.viii-Page_424"></span>court to wait upon him, and offer him
a share in the empire. Attalus, however, refused to share power with
another, and sent word that Honorius might choose an island or any spot
of ground that he pleased for his private residence, and that he would
be allowed every imperial service. The affairs of Honorius were reduced
to so critical a condition, that ships were kept in readiness to convey
him, if it were necessary, to his nephew, when an army of four thousand
men which had started from the west arrived unexpectedly during the
night at Ravenna; Honorius caused the walls of the city to be guarded by
this reinforcement, for he distrusted the native troops as inclined to
treachery.

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p4"></span>In the meantime Heraclean had put
Constans to death, and had ranged troops along the ports and coasts of
Africa to hinder the merchant vessels from going to Rome. When, as a
consequence, a famine seized the Romans, they sent a deputation to
Attalus about it. Being at a loss what measures to adopt, he returned to
Rome to consult the senate. The famine was so grievous that chestnuts
were used by the people to supply the place of corn, and some persons
were suspected of having partaken of human flesh. Alaric advised that
five hundred barbarians should be sent into Africa against Heraclean,
but the senators and Attalus objected that Africa ought not to be
entrusted to barbarians. It then became evident to Alaric that God
disapproved of the rule of Attalus; and finding that it would be futile
to labor for a matter which was beyond his power, and after receiving
certain pledges, he agreed with Honorius to deprive Attalus of his
sovereignty. All the parties concerned assembled together without the
walls of the city, and Attalus threw aside the symbols of imperial
power. His officers also threw aside their girdles, and Honorius granted
pardon to all for these occurrences, and each was to hold the honor and
office which he had first had. Attalus retired with his son to Alaric,
for he thought his life would not be in safety as yet, if he continued
to dwell among the Romans.
