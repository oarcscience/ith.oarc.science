<span id="ii.viii.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*The Emperor Gratian
recalls the Orthodox Bishops, and expels the Heretics from the Churches.
He takes Theodosius as his Colleague in the Empire.*

<span id="ii.viii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>Gratian</span> being now in possession of
the empire, together with Valentinian the younger, and condemning the
cruel policy of his uncle Valens towards the \[orthodox\] Christians,
recalled those whom he had sent into exile. He moreover enacted that
persons of all sects, without distinction, might securely assemble
together in their <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span
id="ii.viii.iii-Page_119"></span>churches; and that only the
Eunomians, <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) Photinians, <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) and Manichæans <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) should be excluded from the churches.
Being also sensible of the languishing condition of the Roman empire,
and of the growing power of the barbarians and perceiving that the state
was in need of a brave and prudent man, he took Theodosius as his
colleague in the sovereign power. This \[Theodosius\] was descended from
a noble family in Spain, and had acquired so distinguished a celebrity
for his prowess in the wars, that he was universally considered worthy
of imperial dignity, even before Gratian’s election of him. Having
therefore proclaimed him emperor at Sirmium a city of Illyricum in the
consulate <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) of Ausonius and
Olybrius, on the 16th of January, he divided with him the care of
managing the war against the barbarians.
