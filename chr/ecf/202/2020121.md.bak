<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Refutation of what
Libanius the Sophist said concerning Julian.*

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>‘<span class="c13"><span
id="ii.vi.xxiii-p2.1"></span>When</span> the winter,’ says he, <span
id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) ‘had lengthened the nights, the
emperor made an attack on those books which made the man of Palestine
both God, and the Son of God: and by a long series of arguments having
proved that these writings, which are so much revered by Christians, are
ridiculous and unfounded, he has evinced himself wiser and more skillful
than the Tyrian <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) old man. But may
this Tyrian sage be propitious to me, and mildly bear with what has been
affirmed, seeing that he has been excelled by his son!’ Such is the
language of Libanius the Sophist. But I confess, indeed, that he was an
excellent rhetorician, but am persuaded that had he not coincided with
the emperor in religious sentiment, he would not only have given
expression to all that has been said against him by Christians, but
would have magnified every ground of censure as naturally becomes a
rhetorician. For while Constantius was alive he wrote encomiums upon
him; but after his death he brought the most insulting and reproachful
charges against him. So that if Porphyry had been emperor, Libanius
would certainly have preferred his books to Julian’s: and had Julian
been a mere sophist, he would have termed him a very indifferent one, as
he does Ecebolius in his *Epitaph upon Julian.* Since then he has spoken
in the spirit of a pagan, a sophist, and the friend of him whom he
lauded, we shall endeavor to meet what he has advanced, as far as we are
able. In the first place he says that the emperor undertook to ‘attack’
these books during the long winter nights. Now to ‘attack’ means to make
the writing of a confutation of them a task, as the sophists commonly do
in teaching the rudiments of their art; for he had perused these books
long before, but attacked them at this time. But throughout the long
contest into which he entered, instead of attempting to disprove
anything by sound reasoning, as Libanius asserts, in the absence of
truth he had recourse to sneers and contemptuous jests, of which he was
excessively fond; and thus he sought to hold up to derision what is too
firmly established to be overthrown. For every one who enters into
controversy with another, sometimes trying to pervert the truth, and at
others to conceal it, falsifies by every possible means the position of
his antagonist. And an adversary is not satisfied with doing malignant
acts against one with whom he is at variance, but will speak against him
also, and charge upon the object of his dislike the very faults he is
conscious of in himself. That both Julian and Porphyry, whom Libanius
calls the ‘Tyrian old man,’ took great delight in scoffing, is evident
from their own works. For Porphyry in his *History of the Philosophers*
has treated with ridicule the life of Socrates, the most eminent of
<span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span
id="ii.vi.xxiii-Page_92"></span>all the philosophers, making such
remarks on him as neither Melitus, nor Anytus, his accusers, would have
dared to utter; of Socrates, I say, who was admired by all the Greeks
for his modesty, justice, and other virtues; whom Plato, <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) the most admirable among them,
Xenophon, and the rest of the philosophic band, not only honor as one
beloved of God, but also are accustomed to think of as having been
endowed with superhuman intelligence. And Julian, imitating his
‘father,’ displayed a like morbidness of mind in his book, entitled *The
Cæsars,* wherein he traduces all his imperial predecessors, not sparing
even Mark the philosopher. <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) Their
own writings therefore show that they both took pleasure in taunts and
reviling; and I have no need of profuse and clever expressions to do
this; but what has been said is enough concerning their mood in this
respect. Now I write these things, using the oration of each as
witnesses respecting their dispositions, but of Julian in particular,
what Gregory of Nazianzus <span id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) says
in his *Second Oration against the Pagans* is in the following terms:

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p8"></span>‘These things were made evident to
others by experience, after the possession of imperial authority had
left him free to follow the bent of his inclinations: but I had foreseen
it all, from the time I became acquainted with him at Athens. Thither he
came, by permission of the emperor, soon after the change in his
brother’s fortune. His motive for this visit was twofold: one reason was
honorable to him, viz. to see Greece, and attend the schools there; the
other was a more secret one, which few knew anything about, for his
impiety had not yet presumed to openly avow itself, viz. to have
opportunity of consulting the sacrificers and other impostors respecting
his own destiny. I well remember that even then I was no bad diviner
concerning this person, although I by no means pretend to be one of
those skilled in the art of divination: but the fickleness of his
disposition, and the incredible extravagancy of his mind, rendered me
prophetic; if indeed he is the “best prophet who conjectures
correctly” <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) events. For it seemed
to me that no good was portended by a neck seldom steady, the frequent
shrugging of shoulders, an eye scowling and always in motion, together
with a frenzied aspect; a gait irregular and tottering, a nose breathing
only contempt and insult, with ridiculous contortions of countenance
expressive of the same thing; immoderate and very loud laughter, nods as
it were of assent, and drawings back of the head as if in denial,
without any visible cause; speech with hesitancy and interrupted by his
breathing; disorderly and senseless questions, answers no better, all
jumbled together without the least consistency or method. Why need I
enter into minute particulars? Such I foresaw he would be beforehand as
I found him afterwards from experience. And if any of those who were
then present and heard me, were now here, they would readily testify
that when I observed these prognostics I exclaimed, “Ah! how great a
mischief to itself is the Roman empire fostering!” And that when I had
uttered these words I prayed God that I might be a false prophet. For it
would have been far better \[that I should have been convicted of having
formed an erroneous judgment\], than that the world should be filled
with so many calamities, and that such a monster should have appeared as
never before had been seen: although many deluges and conflagrations are
recorded, many earthquakes and chasms, and descriptions are given of
many ferocious and inhuman men, as well as prodigies of the brute
creation, compounded of different races, of which nature produced
unusual forms. His end has indeed been such as corresponds with the
madness of his career.’

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p10"></span>This is the sketch which Gregory has
given us of Julian. Moreover, that in their various compilations they
have endeavored to do violence to the truth, sometimes by the corruption
of passages of sacred Scripture, at others by either adding to the
express words, and putting such a construction upon them as suited their
own purpose, many have demonstrated, by confuting their cavils, and
exposing their fallacies. Origen in particular, who lived long before
Julian’s time, by himself raising objections to such passages of Holy
Scripture <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) as seemed to disturb
some readers, and then fully meeting them, has shut out the invidious
clamors of the thoughtless. And had Julian and Porphyry given his
writings a candid and serious perusal, they would have discoursed on
other topics, and not have turned to the framing of blasphemous
sophisms. It is also very obvious that the emperor in his discourses was
intent on beguiling the ignorant, and did not address himself to those
who possess the ‘form’ of the truth as it is presented in the sacred
Scriptures. For having grouped together various expressions in which God
is spoken of dispensationally, and more according to the manner of men,
he thus comments on them. <span id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) ‘Every
one of these expressions is full of blasphemy against <span
id="page_93">p. 93</span> <span id="ii.vi.xxiii-Page_93"></span>God,
unless the phrase contains some occult and mysterious sense, which
indeed I can suppose.’ This is the exact language he uses in his third
book against the Christians. But in his treatise *On the Cynic
Philosophy,* where he shows to what extent fables may be invented on
religious subjects, he says that in such matters the truth must be
veiled: ‘For,’ to quote his very words, <span
id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) ‘Nature loves concealment; and the
hidden substance of the gods cannot endure being cast into polluted ears
in naked words.’ From which it is manifest that the emperor entertained
this notion concerning the divine Scriptures, that they are mystical
discourses, containing in them some abstruse meaning. He is also very
indignant because all men do not form the same opinion of them; and
inveighs against those Christians who understand the sacred oracles in a
more literal sense. But it ill became him to rail so vehemently against
the simplicity of the vulgar, and on their account to behave so
arrogantly towards the sacred Scriptures: nor was he warranted in
turning with aversion from those things which others rightly
apprehended, because forsooth they understood them otherwise than he
desired they should. But now as it seems a similar cause of disgust
seems to have operated upon him to that which affected Porphyry, who
having been beaten by some Christians at Cæsarea in Palestine and not
being able to endure \[such treatment\], from the working of
unrestrained rage renounced the Christian religion: and from hatred of
those who had beaten him he took to write blasphemous works against
Christians, as Eusebius Pamphilus has proved who at the same time
refuted his writings. So the emperor having uttered disdainful
expressions against the Christians in the presence of an unthinking
multitude, through the same morbid condition of mind fell into
Porphyry’s blasphemies. Since therefore they both willfully broke forth
into impiety, they are punished by the consciousness of their guilt. But
when Libanius the Sophist says <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md)
in derision, that the Christians make ‘a man of Palestine both God and
the Son of God,’ he appears to have forgotten that he himself has
deified Julian at the close of his oration. ‘For they almost killed,’
says he, ‘the first messenger of his death, as if he had lied against a
god.’ And a little afterwards he adds, ‘O thou cherished one of the
gods! thou disciple of the gods! thou associate <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) with the gods!’ Now although Libanius
may have meant otherwise, yet inasmuch as he did not avoid the ambiguity
of a word which is sometimes taken in a bad sense, he seems to have said
the same things as the Christians had done reproachfully. If then it was
his intention to praise him, he ought to have avoided equivocal terms;
as he did on another occasion, when being criticised he avoided a
certain word, cutting it out of his works. Moreover, that man in Christ
was united to the Godhead, so that while he was apparently but man, he
was the invisible God, and that both these things are most true, the
divine books of Christians distinctly teach. But the heathen before they
believe, cannot understand: for it is a divine oracle that
declares <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) ‘Unless ye believe,
assuredly ye shall not understand.’ Wherefore they are not ashamed to
place many men among the number of their gods: and would that they had
done this, at least to the good, just, and sober, instead of the impure,
unjust, and those addicted to drunkenness, like the Hercules, the
Bacchus, and the Æsculapius, by whom Libanius does not blush to swear
frequently in his orations. And were I to attempt to enumerate the
unnatural debaucheries and infamous adulteries of these, the digression
would be lengthened beyond measure: but for those who desire to be
informed on the subject, *Aristotle’s Peplum, Dionysius’ Corona,
Rheginus’ Polymnemon,* and the whole host of poets will be enough to
show that the pagan theology is a tissue of extravagant absurdities. We
might indeed show by a variety of instances that the practice of
deifying human beings was far from uncommon among the heathen, nay, that
they did so without the slightest hesitation: let a few examples
suffice. The Rhodians having consulted an oracle on some public
calamity, a response was given directing them to pay their adoration to
Atys, a pagan priest who instituted frantic rites in Phrygia. The oracle
was thus expressed:

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p17"></span>‘Atys propitiate, the great god, the
chaste Adonis, the blessed fair-haired Dionysius rich in gifts.’

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p18"></span>Here Atys, who from an amatory mania
had castrated himself, is by the oracle designated as Adonis and
Bacchus.

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p19"></span>Again, when Alexander, king of the
Macedonians, passed over into Asia, the Amphictyons courted his favor,
and the Pythoness uttered this oracle:

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p20"></span>‘To Zeus supreme among the gods, and
Athene Tritogenia pay homage, and to the king divine concealed in mortal
form, him Zeus begat in honor to be the protector and dispenser of
justice among mortals, Alexander the king.’

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p21"></span>These are the words of the demon at
Delphi, who when he wished to flatter potentates, did not scruple to
assign them a place among the gods. The motive here was perhaps to
concili<span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="ii.vi.xxiii-Page_94"></span>ate by adulation: but what could one say
of the case of Cleomedes the pugilist, whom they ranked among the gods
in this oracle?

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p22"></span>‘The last of the heroes is Cleomedes,
the Astypalian. Him honor with sacrifices; for he is no longer a
mortal.’

<span id="ii.vi.xxiii-p23"></span>Because of this oracle Diogenes the
cynic, and Oënomaus the philosopher, strongly condemned Apollo. The
inhabitants of Cyzicus declared Hadrian to be the thirteenth god; and
Adrian himself deified his own catamite Antinoüs. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) Libanius does not term these
‘ridiculous and contemptible absurdities,’ although he was familiar with
these oracles, as well as with the work of Adrias on the life of
Alexander <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) (the pseudo-prophet of
Paphlagonia): nor does he himself hesitate to dignify Porphyry in a
similar manner, when after having preferred Julian’s books to his, he
says, ‘May the Syrian be propitious to me.’ This digression will suffice
to repel the scoffs of the sophist, without following him farther in
what he has advanced; for to enter into a complete refutation would
require an express work. We shall therefore proceed with our history.
