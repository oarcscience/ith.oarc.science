<span id="iii.ix.xxx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*George, Bishop of
Antioch, and the Chief-Priests of Jerusalem. Three Chief-Priests
successively succeed Cyril; Restoration of Cyril to the See of
Jerusalem*.

<span id="iii.ix.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxx-p2.1"></span>During</span> this period, <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md) Athanasius was obliged to remain in
concealment, and George returned to Alexandria, and commenced a cruel
persecution against the pagans, and against the Christians who differed
from him in opinion. He compelled both parties to offer worship in the
mode he indicated, and where opposition was made, he enforced obedience
by compulsion. He was hated by the rulers because he scorned them and
was giving orders to the officers; and the multitude detested him on
account of his tyranny, for his power was greater than all the rest. The
pagans regarded him with even greater aversion than the Christians,
because he prohibited them from offering sacrifices, and from
celebrating their ancestral festivals; and because he had on one
occasion, introduced the governor of Egypt <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md) and armed soldiery into the city,
and despoiled their images, votives and temple ornaments. This was, in
fact, the cause of his death, on which I will dwell.

<span id="iii.ix.xxx-p5"></span>On the deposition of Cyril, Erennius
obtained the church of Jerusalem; <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) he was succeeded by Heraclius, and
to Heraclius succeeded Hilarius; for we have gathered from tradition
that in that period these persons administered the church there, until
the reign of Theodosius, when Cyril was once more restored to his own
see.
