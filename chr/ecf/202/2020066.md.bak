<span id="ii.v.xvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*The Emperor Constantius,
through an Order to Philip the Prætorian Prefect, secures the Exile of
Paul, and the Installation of Macedonius in his See.*

<span id="ii.v.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xvi-p2.1"></span>When</span> the Emperor Constantius, who then
held his court at Antioch, heard that Paul had again obtained possession
of the episcopal throne, he was excessively enraged at his presumption.
He therefore despatched a written order to Philip, the Prætorian
Prefect, whose power exceeded that of the other governors of provinces,
and who was styled the second person from the emperor, <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) to drive Paul out of the church again,
and introduce Macedonius into it in his place. Now the prefect Philip,
dreading an insurrectionary movement among the people, used artifice to
entrap the bishop: keeping, therefore, the emperor’s mandate secret, he
went to the <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span
id="ii.v.xvi-Page_43"></span>public bath called Zeuxippus, and on
pretense of attending to some public affairs, sent to Paul with every
demonstration of respect, requesting his attendance there, on the ground
that his presence was indispensable. The bishop came; and as he came in
obedience to this summons, the prefect immediately showed him the
emperor’s order; the bishop patiently submitted condemnation without a
hearing. But as Philip was afraid of the violence of the multitude—for
great numbers had gathered around the building to see what would take
place, for their suspicions had been aroused by current reports—he
commanded one of the bath doors to be opened which communicated with the
imperial palace, and through that Paul was carried off, put on board a
vessel provided for the purpose, and so sent into exile immediately. The
prefect directed him to go to Thessalonica, the metropolis of Macedonia,
whence he had derived his origin from his ancestors; commanding him to
reside in that city, but granting him permission to visit other cities
of Illyricum, while he strictly forbade his passing into any portion of
the Eastern empire. Thus was Paul, contrary to his expectation, at once
expelled from the church, and from the city, and again hurried off into
exile. Philip, the imperial prefect, leaving the bath, immediately
proceeded to the church. Together with him, as if thrown there by an
engine, Macedonius rode seated in the same seat with the prefect in the
chariot seen by everybody, and a military guard with drawn swords was
about them. The multitude was completely overawed by this spectacle, and
both Arians and Homoousians hastened to the church, every one
endeavoring to secure an entrance there. As the prefect with Macedonius
came near the church, an irrational panic seized the multitude and even
the soldiers themselves; for as the assemblage was so numerous and no
room to admit the passage of the prefect and Macedonius was found, the
soldiers attempted to thrust aside the people by force. But the confined
space into which they were crowded together rendering it impossible to
recede, the soldiers imagined that resistance was offered, and that the
populace intentionally stopped the passage; they accordingly began to
use their naked swords, and to cut down those that stood in their way.
It is affirmed that about 3150 persons were massacred on this occasion;
of whom the greater part fell under the weapons of the soldiers, and the
rest were crushed to death by the desperate efforts of the multitude to
escape their violence. After such distinguished achievements,
Macedonius, as if he had not been the author of any calamity, but was
altogether guiltless of what had been perpetrated, was seated in the
episcopal chair by the prefect, rather than by the ecclesiastical canon.
Thus, then, by means of so many murders in the church, Macedonius and
the Arians grasped the supremacy in the churches. About this period the
emperor built the great church called *Sophia,* adjoining to that named
*Irene,* which being originally of small dimensions, the emperor’s
father had considerably enlarged and adorned. In the present day both
are seen within one enclosure, and have but one appellation.
