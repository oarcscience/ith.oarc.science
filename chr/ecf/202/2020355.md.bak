<span id="iii.viii.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*Concerning the
Doctrines held by the Sons of Constantine. Distinction between the Terms
“Homoousios” and “Homoiousios.” Whence it came that Constantius quickly
abandoned the Correct Faith*.

<span id="iii.viii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperors <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md) had, from the beginning, preserved
their father’s view about doctrine; for they both favored the Nicene
form of belief. Constans maintained these opinions till his death;
Constantius held a similar view for some time; he, however, renounced
his former sentiments when the term “consubstantial” was calumniated,
yet he did not altogether refrain from confessing that the Son is of
like substance with the Father. The followers of Eusebius, and other
bishops of the East, who were admired for their speech and life, made a
distinction, as we know, between the term “consubstantial”
(*homoousios*) and the expression “of like substance,” which latter they
designated by the term, “*homoiousios.*” They say that the term
“consubstantial” (homoousios) properly belongs to corporeal beings, such
as men and other animals, trees and plants, whose participation and
origin is in like things; but that the term “homoiousios” appertains
exclusively to incorporeal beings, such as God and the angels, of each
one of whom a conception is formed according to his own peculiar
substance. The Emperor Constantius was deceived by this distinction; and
although I am certain that he retained the same doctrines as those held
by his father and brother, yet he adopted a change of phraseology, and,
instead of using the term “homoousios,” made use of the term
“homoiousios.” The teachers to whom we have alluded maintained that it
was necessary to be thus precise in the use of terms, and that otherwise
we should be in danger of conceiving that to be a body which is
incorporeal. Many, however, regard this distinction as an absurdity,
“for,” say they, “the things which are conceived by the mind can be

id="iii.viii.xviii-Page_298"></span>designated only by names derived
from things which are seen; and there is no danger in the use of words,
provided that there be no error about the idea.
