<span id="ii.v.viii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*Eusebius having
convened Another Synod at Antioch in Syria, causes a New Creed to be
promulgated.*

<span id="ii.v.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p2.1"></span>Eusebius</span>, however, could by no means
remain quiet, but as the saying is, left no stone unturned, in order to
effect the purpose he had in view. He therefore causes a Synod to be
convened at Antioch in Syria, under pretense of dedicating the church
which the father of the Augusti had commenced, and which his son
Constantius had finished in the tenth year after its foundations were
laid, but with the real intention of subverting and abolishing the
doctrine of the *homoousion.* There were present at this Synod ninety
bishops from various cities. Maximus, however, bishop of Jerusalem; who
had succeeded Macarius, did not attend, recollecting that he had been
deceived and induced to subscribe the deposition of Athanasius. Neither
was Julius, bishop of the great Rome, <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266) there, nor had he sent a substitute,
although an ecclesiastical canon <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267)
commands that the churches shall not make any ordinances against the
opinion of the bishop of Rome. This Synod assembled at Antioch in
presence of the emperor Constantius in the consulate of Marcellus and
Probinus, <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268) which was the fifth
year after the death of Constantine, father of the Augusti. Placitus,
otherwise called Flaccillus, successor to Euphronius, at that time
presided over the church at Antioch. The confederates of Eusebius had
previously designed to calumniate Athanasius; accusing him in the first
place of having acted contrary to a canon which they then constituted,
in resuming his episcopal authority without the license of a general
council of bishops, inasmuch as on his return from exile he had on his
own responsibility taken possession of the church; and then because a
tumult had been excited on his entrance and many were killed in the
riot; <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> <span
id="ii.v.viii-Page_39"></span>moreover that some had been scourged by
him, and others brought before the tribunals. Besides they brought
forward what had been determined against Athanasius at Tyre.

<span id="ii.v.viii-p4"></span>The word ‘canon’ here is evidently used
in its general sense. There is no record of any enactment requiring the
consent of the bishop of Rome to the decisions of the councils before
they could be considered valid. There may have been a general
understanding to that effect, having the force of an unwritten law. In
any case the use of the word by Socrates is quite singular, unless we
assume that he supposed there was such an enactment somewhere, as is
implied by its use ordinarily.
