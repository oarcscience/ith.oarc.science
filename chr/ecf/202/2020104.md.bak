id="ii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*Lucifer goes to Antioch
and consecrates Paulinus.*

<span id="ii.vi.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.vi-p2.1"></span>It</span> was decided therefore that Lucifer
should go to Antioch in Syria, and Eusebius to Alexandria, that by
assembling a Synod in conjunction with Athanasius, they might confirm
the doctrines of the church. Lucifer sent a deacon as his
representative, by whom he pledged himself to assent to whatever the
Synod might decree; but he himself went to Antioch, where he found the
church in great disorder, the people not being agreed among themselves.
For not only did the Arian heresy, which had been introduced by Euzoïus,
divide the church, but, as we before said, <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) the followers of Meletius also, from
attachment to their teacher, separated themselves from those with whom
they agreed in sentiment. When therefore Lucifer had constituted
Paulinus their bishop, he again departed.
