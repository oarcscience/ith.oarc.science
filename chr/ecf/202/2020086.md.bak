<span id="ii.v.xxxvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI</span>.—*Of the Synod at
Milan.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>Now</span> at that time the bishops met in
Italy, very few indeed from the East, most of them being hindered from
coming either by the firmities of age or by the distance; but of the
West there were more than three hundred. <span
id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) It was a command of the emperor that
they should be assembled at Milan. On meeting, the Eastern prelates
opened the Synod by calling upon those convened to pass a unanimous
sentence of condemnation against Athanasius; with this object in view,
that he might thenceforward be utterly shut out from Alexandria. But
Paulinus, bishop of Treves in Gaul, and Dionysius, of whom the former
was bishop of Alba, <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) the
metropolis of Italy, and Eusebius of Vercellæ, a city of Liguria in
Italy, perceiving that the Eastern bishops, by demanding a ratification
of the sentence against Athanasius, were intent on subverting the faith,
arose and loudly exclaimed that ‘this proposition indicated a covert
plot against the principles of Christian truth. For they insisted that
the charges against Athanasius were unfounded, and merely invented by
his accusers as a means of corrupting the faith.’ <span id="page_61">p.
61</span> <span id="ii.v.xxxvi-Page_61"></span>Having made this protest
with much vehemence of manner, the congress of bishops was then
dissolved.

<span id="ii.v.xxxvi-p3"></span>So also Sozomen, IV. 9; but the number
appears exorbitant. Valesius conjectures that the texts of Socrates and
Sozomen are corrupted, and that we must read thirty instead of three
hundred. The smaller number agrees exactly with the list given in the
epistle of this council to Eusebius of Vercellæ; in this list thirty
bishops are named as agreeing to the condemnation of Athanasius,
Marcellus, and Photinus. Cf. Baronius, *Annal.* year 355.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[60:390](2020086.htm#fr_389.md) <span
id="ii.v.xxxvi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.xxxvi-p4"></span>Sozomen (IV. 9) agrees here also with
Socrates; but Athanasius, in *Epist. ad Solitar.,* and after him
Baronius and Valesius, make Milan and not Alba, the metropolis of Italy,
and Dionysius bishop of Milan, and not of Alba.
