id="iii.xii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*Ordination of Flavian as
Bishop of Antioch, and Subsequent Occurrences on Account of the Oath*.

<span id="iii.xii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xi-p2.1"></span>After</span> the pompous interment of the
remains of Meletius, Flavian was ordained in his stead, and that, too,
in direct violation of the oath he had taken; <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) for Paulinus was still alive. This
gave rise to fresh troubles in the church of Antioch. Many persons
refused to maintain communion with Flavian, and held their church apart
with Paulinus. Even the priests differed among themselves on this
subject. The Egyptians, Arabians, and Cypriots were indignant at the
injustice that had been manifested towards Paulinus. On the other hand,
the Syrians, the Palestinians, the Phœnicians, and the greater part of
Armenia, Cappadocia, Galatia, and Pontus, sided with Flavian. The bishop
of Rome, and all the Western priests, regarded the conduct of Flavian
with the utmost displeasure. They addressed the customary epistles,
called synodical, to Paulinus as bishop of Antioch, and took no notice
of Flavian. They also withdrew from communion with Diodorus, bishop of
Tarsus, and Acacius, bishop of Berea, because they had ordained
Flavian. <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) To take further
cognizance of the affair, the Western bishops and the Emperor Gratian
wrote to the bishops of the East, and summoned them to attend a council
in the West.
