id="ii.ix.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Epiphanius, in order to
gratify Theophilus, performs Ordinations at Constantinople without
John’s Permission.*

<span id="ii.ix.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xiii-p2.1"></span>Not</span> long after this, at the
suggestion of Theophilus, the bishop Epiphanius again came from Cyprus
to Constantinople; he brought also with him a copy of the synodical
decree in which they did not excommunicate Origen himself but condemned
his books. On reaching *St. John’s* church, which is seven miles distant
from the city, he disembarked, and there celebrated a service; then
after having ordained a deacon, <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md)
he again entered the city. In complaisance to Theophilus he declined
John’s courtesy, and engaged apartments in a private house. He
afterwards assembled those of the bishops who were then in the capital,
and producing his copy of the synodical decree condemnatory of Origen’s
works, recited it before them; not being able to assign any reason for
this judgment, than that it seemed fit to Theophilus and himself to
reject them. Some indeed from a reverential respect for Epiphanius
subscribed the decree; but many refused to do so among whom was
Theotimus bishop of Scythia, who thus addressed Epiphanius:—‘I neither
choose, Epiphanius,’ said he, ‘to insult the memory of one who ended his
life piously long ago; nor dare I be guilty of so impious an act, as
that of condemning what our predecessors did not reject: and especially
when I know of no evil doctrine contained in Origen’s books.’ Having
said this, he brought forward one of that author’s works, and reading a
few passages therefrom, showed that the sentiments propounded were in
perfect accordance with the orthodox faith. He then added, ‘Those who
speak evil of these writings are unconsciously casting dishonor upon the
sacred volume whence their principles are drawn.’ Such was the reply
which Theotimus, a bishop celebrated for his piety and rectitude of
life, made to Epiphanius.

<span id="ii.ix.xiii-p3"></span>It was contrary to the canons of the
church for a bishop to ordain a presbyter or a deacon in another’s
diocese. Cf. *Apostol. Can.* 35. ‘Let not a bishop dare to ordain beyond
his own limits in cities and places not subject to him. But if he be
convicted of doing so without the consent of those persons who have
authority over such cities and places, let him be deposed, and those
also whom he has ordained.’ Also *Can.* 16 of the Council of Nicæa; ‘If
any one should dare to steal, as it were, a person who belongs to
another \[bishop\], and to ordain him for his own church, without
permission of the bishop from whom he was withdrawn, the ordination
shall be void.’
