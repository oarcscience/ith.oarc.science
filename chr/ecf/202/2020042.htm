<p class="c32"><a name="ii.iv.xxxiii-p1"></A><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXXIII</span>.&#8212;<i>The Members of the Synod proceed from Tyre to Jerusalem, and having celebrated the Dedication of the &#145;New Jerusalem,&#146; receive Arius and his Followers into Communion.</i></p>  
<p class="c24"><a name="ii.iv.xxxiii-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="ii.iv.xxxiii-p2.1"></A>Letters</span> in the meantime were brought from the emperor directing those who composed the Synod to hasten to the <i>New Jerusalem:</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">249</FONT></A>
  having therefore immediately left Tyre, they set forward with all despatch to Jerusalem, where, after celebrating a festival in connection with the consecration of the place, they readmitted Arius&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">250</FONT></A>
  and his adherents into communion, in obedience, as they said, to the wishes of the emperor, who had signified in his communication to them, that he was fully satisfied respecting the faith of Arius and Euzo&iuml;us. They moreover wrote to the church at Alexandria,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">251</FONT></A>
  stating that all envy being now banished, the affairs of the church were established in peace: and that since Arius had by his recantation acknowledged the truth, it was but just that, being thenceforth a member of the church, he should also be henceforth received by them, alluding to the banishment of Athanasius [in their statement that &#145;all envy was now banished&#146;]. At the same time they sent information of what had been done to the emperor, in terms nearly to the same effect. But whilst the bishops were engaged in these transactions, other letters came unexpectedly from the emperor, intimating that Athanasius had fled to him for protection; and that it was necessary for them on his account to come to Constantinople. This unanticipated communication from the emperor was as follows. </p>
