<span id="ii.iv.xvii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*The Emperor’s Mother
Helena having come to Jerusalem, searches for and finds the Cross of
Christ, and builds a Church.*

<span id="ii.iv.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>Helena,</span> the emperor’s mother (from
whose name having made Drepanum, once a village, a city, the emperor
called it Helenopolis), being divinely directed by dreams went to
Jerusalem. Finding that which was once Jerusalem, desolate ‘as a
Preserve for autumnal fruits,’ <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)
according to the prophet, she sought carefully the sepulchre of Christ,
from which he arose after his burial; and after much difficulty, by
God’s help she discovered it. What the cause of the difficulty was I
will explain in a few words. Those who embraced the Christian faith,
after the period of his passion, greatly venerated this tomb; but those
who hated Christianity, having covered the spot with a mound of earth,
erected on it a temple to Venus, and set up her image there, not caring
for the memory of the place. <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md)
This succeeded for a long time; and it became known to the emperor’s
mother. Accordingly she having caused the statue <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) to be thrown down, the earth to be
removed, and the ground entirely cleared, found three crosses in the
sepulchre: one of these was that blessed cross on which Christ had hung,
the other two were those on which the two thieves that were crucified
with him had died. With these was also found the tablet <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) of Pilate, on which he had inscribed
in various characters, that the Christ who was crucified was king of the
Jews. Since, however, it was doubtful which was the cross they were in
search of, the emperor’s mother was not a little distressed; but from
this trouble the bishop of Jerusalem, Macarius, shortly relieved her.
And he solved the doubt by faith, for he sought a sign from God and
obtained it. The sign was this: a certain woman of the neighborhood, who
had been long afflicted with disease, was now just at the point of
death; the bishop therefore arranged it so that each of the crosses
should be brought to the dying woman, believing that she would be healed
on touching the precious cross. Nor was he disappointed in his
expectation: for the two crosses having been applied which were not the
Lord’s, the woman still continued in a dying state; but when the third,
which was the true cross, touched her, she was immediately healed, and
recovered her former strength. In this manner then was the genuine cross
discovered. The emperor’s mother erected over the place of the sepulchre
a magnificent church, <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) and named
it *New Jerusalem,* having built it facing that old and deserted city.
There she left a portion of the cross, enclosed in a silver case, as a
memorial to those who might wish to see it: the other part she sent to
the emperor, who being persuaded that the city would be perfectly secure
where that relic should be preserved, privately enclosed it in his own
statue, which stands on a large column of porphyry in the forum called
Constantine’s at Constantinople. I have written this from report indeed;
but almost all the inhabitants of Constantinople affirm that it is true.
Moreover the nails with which Christ’s hands were fastened to the cross
(for his mother having found these also in the sepulchre had sent them)
Constantine took and had made into bridle-bits and a helmet, which he
used in his military expeditions. The emperor supplied all materials for
the construction of the churches, and wrote to Macarius the bishop to
expedite these edifices. When the emperor’s mother had completed the
*New Jerusalem,* she reared another church not at all inferior, over the
cave at Bethlehem where Christ was born according to the flesh: nor did
she stop here, but built a third on the <span id="page_22">p. 22</span>
<span id="ii.iv.xvii-Page_22"></span>mount of his Ascension. So devoutly
was she affected in these matters, that she would pray in the company of
women; and inviting the virgins enrolled in the register <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) of the churches to a repast, serving
them herself, she brought the dishes to table. She was also very
munificent to the churches and to the poor; and having lived a life of
piety, she died when about eighty years old. Her remains were conveyed
to New Rome, the capital, and deposited in the imperial sepulchres.
