<span id="ii.x.xlvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI</span>.—*Death of Paul Bishop of
the Novatians, and Election of Marcian as his Successor.*

<span id="ii.x.xlvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xlvi-p2.1"></span>A little</span> while after the removal of
John’s body, Paul bishop of the Novatians died, on the 21st of July,
under the same consulate: <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) who
at his own funeral united, in a certain sense, all the different sects
into one church. For all parties attended his body to the tomb, chanting
psalms together, inasmuch as even during his lifetime by his rectitude
he was in universal esteem by all. But as Paul just before his death
performed a memorable act, I deem it advantageous to insert it in this
history as it may be interesting to the readers of this work to be
acquainted with it. And lest the brilliancy of that important deed
should be obscured by dwelling on circumstantial details of minor
consequence, I shall not stay to expatiate on the strictness with which
he maintained his ascetic discipline as to diet even throughout his
illness, without the least departure from the course he had prescribed
for himself, or the omission of any of the ordinary exercises of
devotion with his accustomed fervor. But what was this deed? Conscious
that his departure was at hand, he sent for all the presbyters of the
churches under his care, and thus addressed them: ‘Give your attention
while I am alive to the election of a bishop to preside over you, lest
the peace of your churches should hereafter be disturbed.’ They having
answered that this affair had better not be left to them: ‘For
inasmuch,’ said they, ‘as some of us have one judgment about the matter,
and some another, we would by no means nominate the same individual. We
wish therefore that you would yourself designate the person you would
desire to succeed you.’ ‘Give me then,’ said Paul, ‘this declaration of
yours in writing, that you will elect him whom I should appoint.’ When
they had written this pledge, and ratified it by their signatures, Paul,
rising in his bed and sitting up, wrote the name of Marcian in the
paper, without informing any of those present what he had inserted. This
person had been promoted to the rank of presbyter, and instructed in the
ascetic discipline by him, but was then gone abroad. Having folded this
document and put his own seal on it, he caused the principal presbyters
to seal it also; after which he delivered it into the hands of Marcus
<span id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span id="ii.x.xlvi-Page_178"></span>a
bishop of the Novatians in Scythia, who was at that time staying at
Constantinople, to whom he thus spake, ‘If it shall please God that I
should continue much longer in this life, restore me this deposit, now
entrusted to your safe keeping. But should it seem fit to him to remove
me, you will herein discover whom I have chosen as my successor in the
bishopric.’ Soon after this he died; and on the third day after his
death, the paper having been unfolded in the presence of a great number
of persons, Marcian’s name was found within it, when they all cried out
that he was worthy of the honor. Messengers were therefore sent off
without delay to bring him to Constantinople. These, by a pious fraud,
finding him residing at Tiberiopolis in Phrygia, brought him back with
them; whereupon he was ordained and placed in the episcopal chair on the
21st of the same month. <span id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md)

<span id="ii.x.xlvi-p4"></span>This seems hardly probable when compared
with the opening sentence of the chapter, and so Valesius with
Christophorson and others change it into August. The emendation
suggested in the Greek is not a difficult one; it simply adds between
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.x.xlvi-p4.1"></span>αὐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.x.xlvi-p4.2"></span>-</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.x.xlvi-p4.3"></span>τοῦ</span> of the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.x.xlvi-p4.4"></span>αὐτοῦ</span> (above
translated ‘the same’), the syllable <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.x.xlvi-p4.5"></span>γουσ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.x.xlvi-p4.6"></span>-</span> making it thus, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.x.xlvi-p4.7"></span>αὐγούστου μηνός</span>,
‘month of August.’ The emendation, or something equivalent to it, must
be accepted, otherwise we are compelled to place the death of Paul and
the ordination of Marcian together with the intervening events on the
same day.
