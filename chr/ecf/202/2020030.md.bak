id="ii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*Of Anthony the Monk.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxi-p2.1"></span>What</span> sort of a man the monk Anthony
was, who lived in the same age, in the Egyptian desert, and how he
openly contended with devils, clearly detecting their devices and wily
modes of warfare, and how he performed many miracles, it would be
superfluous for us to say; for Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, has
anticipated us, having devoted an entire book to his biography. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) Of such good men there was a large
number at one time during the years of the Emperor Constantine.
