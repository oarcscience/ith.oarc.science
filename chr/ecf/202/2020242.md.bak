<span id="ii.x.xxv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Christian Benevolence of
Atticus Bishop of Constantinople. He registers John’s Name in the
Diptychs. His Fore-knowledge of his Own Death.*

<span id="ii.x.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxv-p2.1"></span>Meanwhile</span> Atticus the bishop caused the
affairs of the church to flourish in an extraordinary manner;
administering all things with prudence, and inciting the people to
virtue by his instruction. Perceiving that the church was on the point
of being divided inasmuch as the Johannites <span
id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) assembled themselves apart, he ordered
that mention of John should be made in the prayers, as was customary to
be done of the other deceased <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md)
bishops; by which means he trusted that many would be induced to return
to the Church. And he was so liberal that he not only provided for the
poor of his own parishes, but transmitted contributions to supply the
wants and promote the comfort of the indigent in the neighboring cities
also. On one occasion as he sent to Calliopius a presbyter of the church
at Nicæa, three hundred pieces <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971.md)
of gold he also dispatched the following letter.

<span id="ii.x.xxv-p6"></span>‘Atticus to Calliopius—salutations in the
Lord.

<span id="ii.x.xxv-p7"></span>‘I have been informed that there are in
your city ten thousand necessitous persons whose condition demands the
compassion of the pious. <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span
id="ii.x.xxv-Page_167"></span>And I say ten thousand, designating their
multitude rather than using the number precisely. As therefore I have
received a sum of money from him, who with a bountiful hand is wont to
supply faithful stewards; and since it happens that some are pressed by
want, that those who have may be proved, who yet do not minister to the
needy—take, my friend, these three hundred pieces of gold, and dispose
of them as you may think fit. It will be your care, I doubt not, to
distribute to such as are ashamed to beg, and not to those who through
life have sought to feed themselves at others’ expense. In bestowing
these alms make no distinction on religious grounds; but feed the hungry
whether they agree with us in sentiment, or not.’

<span id="ii.x.xxv-p8"></span>Thus did Atticus consider even the poor
who were at a distance from him. He labored also to abolish the
superstitions of certain persons. For on being informed that those who
had separated themselves from the Novatians, on account of the Jewish
Passover, had transported the body of Sabbatius <span
id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) from the island of Rhodes—for in that
island he had died in exile—and having buried it, were accustomed to
pray at his grave, he caused the body to be disinterred at night, and
deposited in a private sepulchre; and those who had formerly paid their
adorations at that place, on finding his tomb had been opened, ceased
honoring that tomb thenceforth. Moreover he manifested a great deal of
taste in the application of names to places. To a port in the mouth of
the Euxine sea, anciently called Pharmaceus, <span
id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973.md) he gave the appellation of
Therapeia; <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974.md) because he would not
have a place where religious assemblies were held, dishonored by an
inauspicious name. Another place, a suburb of Constantinople, he termed
Argyropolis, <span id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md) for this reason.
Chrysopolis <span id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md) is an ancient port
situated at the head of the Bosphorus, and is mentioned by several of
the early writers, especially Strabo, Nicolaus Damascenus, and the
illustrious Xenophon in the sixth book of his *Anabasis of Cyrus*; <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md) and again in the first of his
*Hellenica* <span id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) he says concerning
it, ‘that Alcibiades having walled it round, established a toll in it;
for all who sailed out of Pontus were accustomed to pay tithes there.’
Atticus seeing the former place to be directly opposite to Chrysopolis,
and very delightfully situated, declared that it was most fitting it
should be called Argyropolis; and as soon as this was said it firmly
established the name. Some persons having said to him that the Novatians
ought not to be permitted to hold their assemblies within the cities:
‘Do you not know,’ he replied, ‘that they were fellow-sufferers with us
in the persecution under Constantius and Valens? <span
id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md) Besides,’ said he, ‘they are witnesses
to our creed: for although they separated from the church a long while
ago, they have never introduced any innovations concerning the faith.’
Being once at Nicæa on account of the ordination of a bishop, and seeing
there Asclepiades bishop of the Novatians, then very aged, he asked him,
‘How many years have you been a bishop?’ When he was answered fifty
years: ‘You are a happy man,’ said he, ‘to have had charge of so “good a
work” <span id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) for such a length of
time.’ To the same Asclepiades he observed: ‘I commend Novatus; but can
by no means approve of the Novatians.’ And when Asclepiades, surprised
at this strange remark, said, ‘What is the meaning of your remark,
bishop?’ Atticus gave him this reason for the distinction. ‘I approve of
Novatus for refusing to commune with those who had sacrificed, for I
myself would have done the same: but I cannot praise the Novatians,
inasmuch as they exclude laymen from communion for very trivial
offenses.’ Asclepiades answered, ‘There are many other “sins unto
death,” <span id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) as the Scriptures term
them, besides sacrificing to idols; on account of which even you
excommunicate ecclesiastics only, but we laymen also, reserving to God
alone the power of pardoning them.’ <span
id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) Atticus had moreover a presentiment of
his own death; for at his departure from Nicæa, he said to Calliopius a
presbyter of that place: ‘Hasten to Constantinople before autumn if you
wish to see me again alive; for if you delay beyond that time, you will
not find me surviving.’ Nor did he err in this prediction; for he died
on the 10th of October, in the 21st year of his episcopate, under the
eleventh consulate of Theodosius, and the first of Valentinian
Cæsar. <span id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983.md) The Emperor Theodosius
indeed, being then on his way from Thessalonica, did not reach
Constantinople in time for his funeral, for Atticus had been consigned
to the grave one day before the emperor’s arrival. Not long afterwards,
on the 23d of the same month, October, the young Valentinian was
proclaimed Augustus. <span id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md)

senses, viz. (1) healing, (2) service, (3) worship. Probably, and as the
sentence following seems to indicate, the last of these was the one
meant to be emphasized; this is also borne out by the plural number
used. If the first sense were the one for which the word was chosen, it
must have been because of its being in complete contrast to the previous
name. The place retains the name thus given it to this day and
constitutes one of the suburbs of Constantinople.

<span id="ii.x.xxv-p19"></span>The Catholic Church was more severe in
its discipline regarding the clergy than the laity, but it does not
appear that excommunication was in any case absolute and reinstatement
impossible. See on this point the liberal views of Chrysostom, VI. 21.
