id="iii.x.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Concerning St. Hilarion and
the Virgins in Heliopolis who were destroyed by Swine. Strange Martyrdom
of Mark, Bishop of Arethusa*.

<span id="iii.x.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.x-p2.1"></span>At</span> the same period the inhabitants of
Gaza sought for the monk Hilarion; but he had fled to Sicily. <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) Here he employed himself in
collecting wood in the deserts and on the mountains, which he carried on
his shoulders for sale in the cities, and, by these means, obtained
sufficient food for the support of the body. But as he was at length
recognized by a man of quality whom he had dispossessed of a demon, he
retired to Dalmatia, where, by the power of God, he performed numerous
miracles, and through prayer, repressed an inundation of the sea and
restored the waves to their proper bounds, and again departed, for it
was no joy to him to live among those who praised him; but when he
changed his place of abode, he was desirous of being unobserved and by
frequent migrations to be rid of the fame which prevailed about him.
Eventually he sailed for the island of Cyprus, but touched at Paphos,
and, at the entreaty of the bishop of Cyprus, he loved the life there
and practiced philosophy at a place called Charburis.

<span id="iii.x.x-p4"></span>Here he only escaped martyrdom by flight;
for he fled in compliance with the Divine precept which commands us not
to expose ourselves to persecution; but that if we fall into the hands
of persecutors, to overcome by our own fortitude the violence of our
oppressors.

<span id="iii.x.x-p5"></span>The inhabitants of Gaza and of Alexandria
were not the only citizens who exercised such atrocities against the
Christians as those I have described. The inhabitants of Heliopolis,
near Mount Libanus, and of Arethusa in Syria, seem to have surpassed
them in excess of cruelty. <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md)
The former were guilty of an act of barbarity which could scarcely be
credited, had it not been corroborated by the testimony of those who
witnessed it. They stripped the holy virgins, who had never been looked
upon by the multitude, of their garments, and exposed them in a state of
nudity as a public spectacle and objects of insult. After numerous other
inflictions they at last shaved them, ripped them open, and concealed in
their viscera the food usually given to pigs; and since the swine could
not distinguish, but were impelled by the need of their customary food,
they also tore in pieces the human flesh.

<span id="iii.x.x-p7"></span>I am convinced that the citizens of
Heliopolis perpetrated this barbarity against the holy virgins on
account of the prohibition of the ancient custom of yielding up virgins
to prostitution with any chance comer before being united in marriage to
their betrothed. This custom was prohibited by a law enacted by
Constantine, after he had destroyed the temple of Venus at Heliopolis,
and erected a church upon its ruins. <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md)

<span id="iii.x.x-p9"></span>Mark, bishop of Arethusa, <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) an old man and venerable for his
gray hairs and life, was put to a very cruel death by the inhabitants of
that city, who had long entertained inimical feelings against him,
because, during the reign of Constantine, he had more spiritedly than
persuasively elevated the pagans to Christianity, and had demolished a
most sacred and magnificent temple. On the accession of Julian he saw
that the people were excited against the bishop; an edict was issued
commanding the bishop either to defray the expenses of its re-erection,
or to rebuild the temple. Reflecting that the one was impossible and the
other unlawful for a Christian and still less for a priest, he at first
fled from the city. On hearing, however, that many were suffering on his
account, that some were dragged before the tribunals and others
tortured, he returned, and offered to suffer whatever the multitude
might choose to inflict upon him. The entire people, instead of admiring
him the more as having manifested a deed befitting a philosopher,
conceived that he was actuated by contempt towards them, and rushed upon
him, dragged him through the streets, pressing and plucking and beating
whatever member each one happened upon. People of each sex and of all
ages joined with alacrity and fury in this atrocious proceeding. His
ears were severed by fine ropes; the boys who frequented the schools
made game of him by tossing him aloft and rolling him over and over,
sending him forward, catching him up, and unsparingly piercing him with
their styles. When his whole body was covered with wounds, and he
nevertheless was still breathing, they anointed him with honey and a
certain mixture, and placing him in a fish-basket made of woven rushes,
raised him up on an eminence. It is said that while he was in this
position, and the wasps and bees lit upon him and consumed his flesh, he
told the inhabitants of Arethusa that he was raised up above them, and
could look down upon them below him, and that this reminded him of the
difference that would exist between them in the life to come. It is also
related that the prefect <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) who,
although a pagan, was of such noble conduct that his memory is still
honored in that country, admired the self-control of Mark, and boldly
uttered reproaches against the emperor for allowing himself to be <span
id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span
id="iii.x.x-Page_334"></span>vanquished by an old man, who was exposed
to innumerable tortures; and he added that such proceedings reflected
ridicule on the emperor, while the names of the persecuted were at the
same time rendered illustrious. Thus did the blessed one <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) endure all the torments inflicted
upon him by the inhabitants of Arethusa with such unshaken fortitude
that even the pagans praised him.
