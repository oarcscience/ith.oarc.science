<span id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII</span>.—*Monks of Syria
and Persia: Battheus, Eusebius, Barges, Halas, Abbo, Lazarus, Abdaleus,
Zeno, Heliodorus, Eusebius of Carræ, Protogenes, and Aones*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us pass thence to Syria and
Persia, <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) the parts adjacent to
Syria. We shall find that the monks of these countries emulated those of
Egypt in the practice of philosophy. Battheus, Eusebius, Barges, Halas,
Abbos, Lazarus, who attained the episcopal dignity, Abdaleus, Zeno, and
Heliodorus, flourished in Nisibis, near the mountain called Sigoron.
When they first entered upon the philosophic career, they were
denominated shepherds, because they had no houses, ate neither bread nor
meat, and drank no wine; but dwelt constantly on the mountains, and
passed their time in praising God by prayers and hymns, according to the
law of the Church. At the usual hours of meals, they each took a sickle,
and went to the mountain to cut some grass on the mountains, as though
they were flocks in pasture; and this served for their repast. Such was
their course of philosophy. Eusebius voluntarily shut himself up in a
cell to philosophize, near Carræ. <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) Protogenes dwelt in the same
locality, and ruled the church there after Vitus who was then bishop.
This is the celebrated Vitus of whom they say that when the Emperor
Constantine first saw him, he confessed that God had frequently shown
this man in appearances to him and enjoined him to obey implicitly what
he should say. Aones had a monastery in Phadana; this was the spot where
Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, on his journey from Palestine, met the
damsel whom he afterwards married, and where he rolled away the stone,
that her flock might drink of the water of the well. It is said that
Aones was the first who introduced the life apart from all men, and the
severe philosophy into Syria, just as it was first introduced by Antony
into Egypt.

biographies. Theodoret, *H. E.* iv. 28, has but one identical name; and
the same is true of his *Historia Religiosa.* Battheus, Halas, and
Heliodorus are repeated in the following chapter.
