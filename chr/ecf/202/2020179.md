<span id="ii.viii.xv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*Overthrow and Death of
the Usurper Maximus.*

<span id="ii.viii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xv-p2.1"></span>As</span> the emperor marched against the
usurper the intelligence of the formidable preparations made by him so
alarmed the troops under Maximus, that instead of fighting for him, they
delivered him bound to the emperor, who caused him to be put to death,
on the twenty-seventh of August, under the same consulate. <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) Andragathius, who with his own hand
had slain Gratian, understanding the fate of Maximus, precipitated
himself into the adjacent river, and was drowned. Then the victorious
emperors made their public entry into Rome, accompanied by Honorius the
son of Theodosius, still a mere boy, whom his father had sent for from
Constantinople immediately after Maximus had been vanquished. They
continued therefore at Rome celebrating their triumphal festivals:
during which time the Emperor Theodosius exhibited a remarkable instance
of clemency toward Symmachus, a man who had borne the consular office,
and was at the head of the senate at Rome. For this Symmachus was
distinguished for his eloquence, and many of his orations are still
extant composed in the Latin tongue: but inasmuch as he had written a
panegyric on Maximus, and pronounced it before him publicly, he was
afterwards impeached for high treason; wherefore to escape capital
punishment he took sanctuary in a church. <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) The emperor’s veneration for religion
led him not only to honor the bishops of his own communion, but to treat
with consideration those of the Novatians also, who embraced the
‘homoousian’ creed: to gratify therefore Leontius the bishop of the
Novatian church at Rome, who interceded in behalf of Symmachus, he
graciously pardoned him for that crime. Symmachus, after he had obtained
his pardon, wrote an apologetic address to the Emperor Theodosius. Thus
the war, which at its commencement threatened so seriously, was brought
to a speedy termination.

<span id="ii.viii.xv-p3"></span>The same account is given in substance
by Zosimus, IV. 46, who also confirms the statements of Socrates
concerning the end of Andragathius. Valesius, however, relying on
Idatius’ *Fasti,* asserts that Maximus was put to death on the 28th of
July, not on the 27th of August.
