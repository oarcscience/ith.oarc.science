<span id="iii.xii.iv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*Reign of Theodosius the
Great; he was initiated into Divine Baptism by Ascholius, Bishop of
Thessalonica. The Letters he addressed to those who did not hold the
Definition of the Council of Nice*.

<span id="iii.xii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.iv-p2.1"></span>As</span> Gaul was about this period
infested by the incursions of the Alemanni, <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) Gratian returned to his paternal
dominions, which he had reserved for himself and his brother, when he
bestowed the government of Illyria and of the Eastern provinces upon
Theodosius. He effected his purpose with regard to the barbarians; and
Theodosius was equally successful against the tribes from the banks of
the Ister; he defeated them, compelled them to sue for peace, and, after
accepting hostages from them, proceeded to Thessalonica. He fell ill
while in this city, and after receiving instruction from Ascholius, the
bishop, he was initiated, and was soon after restored to health. The
parents of Theodosius were Christians, and were attached to the Nicene
doctrines; he was pleased with Ascholius, who maintained the same
doctrines, and was, in a word, endowed with every virtue of the
priesthood. He also rejoiced at finding that the Arian heresy had not
been participated in by Illyria. <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) He inquired concerning the
religious sentiments which were prevalent in the other provinces, and
ascertained that, as far as Macedonia, <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) all the churches were like minded,
and all held that equal homage ought to be rendered to God the Word, and
to the Holy Ghost, as to God the Father; but that towards the East, and
particularly at Constantinople, the people were divided into many
different heresies. Reflecting that it would be better to propound his
own religious views to his subjects, so as not to appear to be using
force by commanding the unwilling subject to worship contrary to his
judgment, Theodosius enacted a law at Thessalonica, which he caused to
be published at Constantinople, well knowing that the rescript would
speedily become public to all the other cities, if issued from that
city, which is as a citadel of the whole empire. He made known by this
law his intention of leading all his subjects to the reception of that
faith which Peter, the chief of the apostles, had, from the beginning,
preached to the Romans, and which was professed by Damasus, bishop of
Rome, and by Peter, bishop of Alexandria. He enacted <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) that the title of “Catholic Church”
should be exclusively confined to those who rendered equal homage to the
Three Persons of the Trinity, and that those individuals who entertained
opposite opinions should be treated as heretics, regarded with contempt,
and delivered over to punishment.
