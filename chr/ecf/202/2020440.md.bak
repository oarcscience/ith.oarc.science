<span id="iii.xi.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Concerning St.
Ambrose and his Elevation to the High Priesthood; how he persuaded the
People to practice Piety. The Novatians of Phrygia and the Passover*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxiv-p2.1"></span>The</span> clergy of the West having thus
anticipated the designs of those who sought to introduce innovations
among them, <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) carefully
continued to preserve the inviolability of the faith which had from the
beginning been handed down to them. With the solitary exception of
Auxentius and his partisans, there were no individuals among them who
entertained heterodox opinions. Auxentius, however, did not live long
after this period. At his death a sedition arose among the people
concerning the choice of a bishop for the church of Milan, and the city
was in danger. Those who had aspired to the bishopric, and been defeated
in their expectations, were loud in their menaces, as is usual in such
commotions.

<span id="iii.xi.xxiv-p4"></span>Ambrosius, who was then the governor of
the province, being fearful of the movement of the people, went to the
church, and exhorted the people to cease from contention, to remember
the laws, and to re-establish concord and the prosperity which springs
from peace. Before he had ceased speaking, all his auditors at once
suppressed the angry feelings by which they had been mutually agitated
against each other, and directed the vote of the bishopric upon him, as
a fulfillment of his counsel to harmony. They exhorted him to be
baptized, for he was still uninitiated, and begged him to receive the
priesthood. After he had refused and declined, and unfeignedly fled the
business, the people still insisted, and declared that the contention
would never be appeased unless he would accede to their wishes; and at
length intelligence of these transactions was conveyed to the court. It
is said that the Emperor Valentinian prayed, and returned thanks to God
that the very man whom he had appointed governor had been chosen to fill
a priestly office. When he was informed of the earnest desires of the
people and the refusal of Ambrosius, he inferred that events had been so
ordered by God for the purpose of restoring peace to the church of
Milan, and commanded that Ambrosius should be ordained as quickly as
possible. <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) He was initiated
and ordained at the same time, and forthwith proceeded to bring the
church under his sway to unanimity of opinion concerning the Divine
nature; for, while under the guidance of Auxentius, it had long been
rent by dissensions on this subject. We shall hereafter have occasion to
speak of the conduct of Ambrosius after his ordination, and of the
courageous and holy manner in which he discharged the functions of the
priesthood.

<span id="iii.xi.xxiv-p6"></span>About this period, the Novatians of
Phrygia, contrary to their ancient custom, began to celebrate the
festival of the Passover on the same day as the Jews. Novatius, the
originator of their heresy, refused to receive those who repented of
their sins into communion, and it was in this respect alone that he
innovated upon the established doctrine. But he and those who succeeded
him celebrated the feast of the Passover after the vernal equinox,
according to the custom of the Roman church. Some Novatian bishops,
however, assembled about this time at Pazi, a town of Phrygia, near the
source of the river Sangarus, and agreeing not to follow, in this point
of discipline, the practice of those who differed in doctrine from them,
established a new law; they determined upon keeping the feast of
unleavened bread, and upon celebrating the Passover on the same days as
the Jews. Agelius, the bishop of the Novatians at Constantinople, and
the bishops of the Novatians at Nicæa, Nicomedia, and Cotyæum, a noted
city of Phrygia, did not take part in this Synod, although the Novatians
consider them to be lords and colophons, so to speak, of the
transactions affecting their heresy and their churches. How for this
reason, these innovators advanced into divergence, and having cut
themselves off, formed a separate church, I will speak of at the right
time.
