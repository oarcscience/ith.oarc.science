<span id="iii.vi.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*By the Vision of the
Cross, and by the Appearance of Christ, Constantine is led to embrace
Christianity.—He receives Religious Instruction from our Brethren.*

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.iii-p2.1"></span>We</span> have been informed that
Constantine was led to honor the Christian religion by the concurrence
of several different events, particularly by the appearance of a sign
from heaven.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p3"></span>When he first formed the resolution of
entering into a war against Maxentius, he was beset with doubts as to
the means of carrying on his military operations, and as to the quarter
whence he could look for assistance. In the midst of his perplexity, he
saw, in a vision, the sight of the cross <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) shining in heaven. He was amazed at
the spectacle, but some holy angels who were standing by, exclaimed,
“Oh, Constantine! by this symbol, conquer!” And it is said that Christ
himself appeared to him, and showed him the symbol of the cross, and
commanded him to construct one like unto it, and to retain it as his
help in battle, as it would insure the victory.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p5"></span>Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) affirms that he heard the emperor
declare with an oath, as the sun was on the point of inclining about the
middle of the day, he and the soldiers who were with him saw in heaven
the trophy of the cross <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="iii.vi.iii-Page_242"></span>composed of light, and encircled by the
following words: “By this sign, conquer.”

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p7"></span>This vision met him by the way, when he
was perplexed as to whither he should lead his army. While he was
reflecting on what this could mean, night came; and when he fell asleep,
Christ appeared <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) with the sign
which he had seen in heaven, and commanded him to construct a
representation of the symbol, and to use it as his help in hostile
encounters. There was nothing further to be elucidated; for the emperor
clearly apprehended the necessity of serving God.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p9"></span>At daybreak, <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) he called together the priests of
Christ, and questioned them concerning their doctrines. They opened the
sacred Scriptures, and expounded the truths relative to Christ, and
showed him from the prophets, how the signs which had been predicted,
had been fulfilled. The sign which had appeared to him was the symbol,
they said, of the victory over hell; for Christ came among men, was
stretched upon the cross, died, and returned to life the third day. On
this account, they said, there was hope that at the close of the present
dispensation, there would be a general resurrection of the dead, and
entrance upon immortality, when those who had led a good life would
receive accordingly, and those who had done evil would be punished. Yet,
continued they, the means of salvation and of purification from sin are
provided; namely, for the uninitiated, <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) initiation according to the canons
of the church; and for the initiated, abstinence from renewed sin. But
as few, even among holy men, are capable of complying with this latter
condition, another method of purification is set forth, namely,
repentance; for God, in his love towards man, bestows forgiveness on
those who have fallen into sin, on their repentance, and the
confirmation of their repentance by good works.
