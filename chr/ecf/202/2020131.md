id="ii.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*After the Death of
Procopius Valens constrains those who composed the Synod, and All
Christians, to profess Arianism.*

<span id="ii.vii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.vi-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor having thus successfully
terminated the conflict, immediately began to move <span id="page_98">p.
98</span> <span id="ii.vii.vi-Page_98"></span>against the Christians,
with the design of converting every sect to Arianism. But he was
especially incensed against those who had composed the Synod at
Lampsacus, not only on account of their deposition of the Arian bishops,
but because they had anathematized the creed published at Ariminum. On
arriving therefore at Nicomedia in Bithynia, he sent for Eleusius bishop
of Cyzicus, who, as I have before said, <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576) closely adhered to the opinions of
Macedonius. Therefore the emperor having convened a council of Arian
bishops, commanded Eleusius to give his assent to their faith. At first
he refused to do so, but on being terrified with threats of banishment
and confiscation of property, he was intimidated and assented to the
Arian belief. Immediately afterwards, however, he repented; and
returning to Cyzicus, bitterly complained in presence of all the people,
asserting that his quiescence was due to violence, and not of his own
choice. He then exhorted them to seek another bishop for themselves,
since he had been compelled to renounce his own opinion. But the
inhabitants of Cyzicus loved and venerated him too much to think of
losing him; they therefore refused to be subject to any other bishop,
nor would they permit him to retire from his own church: and thus
continuing under his oversight, they remained steadfast in their own
heresy.
