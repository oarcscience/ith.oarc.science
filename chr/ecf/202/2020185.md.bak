<span id="ii.viii.xxi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Divisions among the
Arians and Other Heretics.*

<span id="ii.viii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxi-p2.1"></span>I conceive</span> it right moreover not to
leave unnoticed the proceedings of the other religious bodies, viz. the
Arians, <span id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) Novatians, and those who
received their denominations from Macedonius and Eunomius. For the
Church once being divided, rested not in that schism, but the
separatists taking occasion from the slightest and most frivolous
pretences, disagreed among themselves. The manner and time, as well as
the causes for which they raised mutual dissensions, we will state as we
proceed. But let it be observed here, that the emperor Theodosius
persecuted none of them except Eunomius; but inasmuch as the latter, by
holding meetings in private houses at Constantinople, where he read
<span id="page_129">p. 129</span> <span
id="ii.viii.xxi-Page_129"></span>the works he had composed, corrupted
many with his doctrines, he ordered him to be sent into exile. Of the
other heretics he interfered with no one; nor did he constrain them to
hold communion with himself; but he allowed them all to assemble in
their own conventicles, and to entertain their own opinions on points of
Christian faith. Permission to build themselves churches without the
cities was granted to the rest: but inasmuch as the Novatians held
sentiments precisely identical with his own as to faith, he ordered that
they should be suffered to continue unmolested in their churches within
the cities, as I have before noticed. <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) Concerning these I think it opportune,
however, to give in this place some farther account, and shall therefore
retrace a few circumstances in their history.
