<span id="iii.xi.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Troubles again arise in
the Churches, and the Synod of Lampsacus is held. The Arians who
supported Eudoxius prevail and eject the Orthodox from the Churches.
Among the Ejected is Meletius of Antioch*.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.vii-p2.1"></span>When</span> Valentinian was journeying from
Constantinople to Rome, <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) he
had to pass through Thrace; and the bishops of Hellespontus and of
Bithynia, with others, who maintained that the Son is consubstantial
with the Father, dispatched Hypatian, bishop of Heraclea in Perinthus,
to meet him, and to request permission to assemble themselves together
for deliberation on questions of doctrine.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p4"></span>When Hypatian had delivered the message
with which he was intrusted, Valentinian made the following reply: “I am
but one of the laity, and have therefore no right to interfere in these
transactions; let the priests, to whom such matters appertain, assemble
where they please.” On receiving this answer through Hypatian, their
deputy, the bishops assembled at Lampsacus.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p5"></span>After having conferred together for the
space of two months, they annulled all that had been decreed at
Constantinople, through the machinations of the partisans of Eudoxius
and Acacius. They likewise declared null and void the formulary of faith
which had been circulated under the false assertion that it was the
compilation of the Western bishops, and to which the signatures of many
bishops had been obtained, by the promise that the dogma of
dissimilarity as to substance should be condemned,—a promise which had
never been performed.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p6"></span>They decreed that the doctrine of the
Son being in substance like unto the Father, should have the ascendancy;
for they said that it was necessary to resort to the use of the term
“like” as indicative of the hypostases of the Godhead. They agreed that
the form of belief which had been confessed at Seleucia, and set forth
at the dedication of the church of Antioch, should be maintained by all
the churches.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p7"></span>They directed that all the bishops who
had been deposed by those who hold that the Son is dissimilar from the
Father, should forthwith be reinstated in their sees, as having been
unjustly ejected from their churches. They declared that if any wished
to bring accusations against them, they would be permitted to do so, but
under the penalty of incurring the same punishment as that due to the
alleged crime, should the accusation prove to be false. The orthodox
bishops of the province and of the neighboring countries were to preside
as judges, and to assemble in the church, with the witnesses who were to
make the depositions.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p8"></span>After making these decisions, the
bishops <span id="page_351">p. 351</span> <span
id="iii.xi.vii-Page_351"></span>summoned the partisans of Eudoxius, and
exhorted them to repentance; but as they would give no heed to these
remonstrances, the decrees enacted by the council were sent to all the
churches. Judging that Eudoxius would be likely to endeavor to persuade
the emperor to side with him, and would calumniate them, they determined
to be beforehand with him, and to send an account of their proceedings
in Lampsacus to the court.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p9"></span>Their deputies met the Emperor Valens as
he was returning from Heraclea to Thrace, where he had been traveling in
company with his brother, who had gone on to Old Rome.

<span id="iii.xi.vii-p10"></span>Eudoxius, however, had previously
gained over the emperor and his courtiers to his own sentiments; so that
when the deputies of the council of Lampsacus presented themselves
before Valens, he merely exhorted them not to be at variance with
Eudoxius. The deputies replied by reminding him of the artifices to
which Eudoxius had resorted at Constantinople, and of his machinations
to annul the decrees of the council of Seleucia; and these
representations kindled the wrath of Valens to such a pitch, that he
condemned the deputies to banishment, and made over the churches to the
partisans of Eudoxius. He then passed over into Syria, for he feared
lest the Persians should break the truce which they had concluded with
Jovian for thirty years. On finding, however, that the Persians were not
disposed to insurrection, he fixed his residence at Antioch. He sent
Meletius, the bishop, into banishment, but spared Paul, because he
admired the sanctity of his life. Those who were not in communion with
Euzoïus were either ejected from the churches, or maltreated and
harassed in some other form.
