id="iii.xi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Sufferings of those who
maintained the Nicene Faith. Agelius, the Ruler of the Novatians*.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> Christians who represented the
Nicene doctrines and the followers of the Novatian views <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) were treated with equal severity in
the city of Constantinople.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p4"></span>They were all ultimately expelled from
the city; and the churches of the Novatians were closed by order of the
emperor. The other party had no churches to be closed, having been <span
id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span
id="iii.xi.ix-Page_352"></span>deprived of them all during the reign of
Constantius.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p5"></span>At this period, Agelius who, from the
time of Constantius, had governed the church of the Novatians at
Constantinople, was condemned to banishment. It is said that he was
especially remarkable for his course of life according to the
ecclesiastical laws. With respect to his mode of life, he had attained
to the highest degree of philosophy, namely, freedom from worldly
possessions; this was evidenced by his daily conduct; he had but one
tunic, and always walked barefooted. Not long after his banishment, he
was recalled, received the churches under him, and boldly convened
churches through the influence of Marcian, a man of extraordinary virtue
and eloquence, who had formerly been enrolled among the troops of the
palace, but at this period was a presbyter of the Novatian heresy, and
the teacher of grammar to Anastasia and Carosa, <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) the daughters of the emperor. There
are still baths at Constantinople which bear the names of these
princesses. It was for the sake of Marcian alone that the privilege
above-mentioned was conceded to the Novatians.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p6"></span>According to Am. Marcel. xxvi. 6, 14, the
Anastasian baths were so called after a sister of Constantine. But Soz.
supposes that there were baths in his day named after the sisters, not
the one, but both. Soc. says only Anastasia. Cf. Idatius, *Desc. Coss.
