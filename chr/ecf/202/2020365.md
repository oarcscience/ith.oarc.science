<span id="iii.ix.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Martyrdom of the Holy
Notaries*.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.iii-p2.1"></span>The</span> persecution increased in
violence, <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286) and led to deeds of
blood. Martyrius and Marcian were among those who were slain. They had
lived in Paul’s house, <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287) and
were delivered up by Macedonius to the governor, as having been guilty
of the murder of Hermogenes, and of exciting the former sedition against
him. Martyrius was a sub-deacon, and Marcian a singer and a reader of
Holy Scripture. Their tomb is famous, and is situated before the walls
of Constantinople, as a memorial of the martyrs; it is placed in a house
of prayer, which was commenced by John and completed by Sisinnius; these
both afterwards presided over the church of Constantinople. For they who
had been unworthily adjudged to have no part in the honors of martyrdom,
were honored by God, because the very place where those conducted to
death had been decapitated, and which previously was not approached on
account of ghosts, was now purified, and those who were under the
influence of demons were released from the disease, and many other
notable miracles were wrought at the tomb. These are the particulars
which should be stated concerning Martyrius and Marcian. If what I have
related appears <span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span
id="iii.ix.iii-Page_302"></span>to be scarcely credible, it is easy to
apply for further information to those who are more accurately
acquainted with the circumstances; and perhaps far more wonderful things
are related concerning them than those which I have detailed.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p4"></span>Niceph. Coll. *H. E.* ix. 30 adds that
they were the notaries of Paul; hence the caption. The memory of these
martyrs is celebrated in the Greek Church under the name of the
Notaries, on the 25th of October.
