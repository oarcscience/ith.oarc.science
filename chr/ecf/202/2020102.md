id="ii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*On the Death of George,
Athanasius returns to Alexandria, and takes Possession of his See.*

<span id="ii.vi.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>Not</span> long after this, Athanasius
returning from his exile, was received with great joy by the people of
Alexandria. They expelled at that time the Arians from the churches, and
restored Athanasius to the possession of them. The Arians meanwhile
assembling themselves in low and obscure buildings, ordained Lucius to
supply the place of George. Such was the state of things at that time at
Alexandria.
