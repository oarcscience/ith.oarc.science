<span id="ii.v.xi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*On the Arrival of Gregory
at Alexandria, tended by a Military Escort, Athanasius flees.*

<span id="ii.v.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xi-p2.1"></span>After</span> these things, Syrian, the military
commander, and the corps of heavy armed soldiers, five thousand in
number, conducted Gregory to Alexandria; and such of the citizens as
were of Arian sentiments combined with them. But it will be proper here
to relate by what means Athanasius escaped the hands of those who wished
to apprehend him, after his expulsion from the church. It was evening,
and the people were attending the vigil there, a service <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) being expected. The commander arrived,
and posted his forces in order of battle on every side of the church.
Athanasius having observed what was done, considered within himself how
he might prevent the people’s suffering in any degree on his account:
accordingly having directed the deacon to give notice of prayer, after
that he ordered the recitation of a psalm; and when the melodious chant
of the psalm arose, all went out through one of the church doors. While
this was doing, the troops remained inactive spectators, and Athanasius
thus escaped unhurt in the midst of those who were chanting the psalm,
and immediately hastened to Rome. Gregory then prevailed in the church:
but the people of Alexandria, being indignant at this procedure, set the
church called that of Dionysius on fire. Let this be sufficient on this
subject. Now Eusebius, having thus far obtained his object, sent a
deputation to Julius, bishop of Rome, <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) begging that he would himself take
cog<span id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span
id="ii.v.xi-Page_41"></span>nizance of the charges against Athanasius,
and order a judicial investigation to be made in his presence. <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md)

later applied to any service held in the church. In mod. <span

<span id="ii.v.xi-p4"></span>So also Sozom. III. 7. But according to
Valesius, both Socrates and Sozomen are here mistaken, and Eusebius sent
the deputation before the council at Antioch, as is shown by the words
of Athanasius in his *Apol. contra Arian*., 21.
