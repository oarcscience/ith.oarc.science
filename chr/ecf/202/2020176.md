<span id="ii.viii.xii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*The Emperor Gratian is
slain by the Treachery of the Usurper Maximus. From Fear of him Justina
ceases persecuting Ambrose.*

<span id="ii.viii.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xii-p2.1"></span>Nearly</span> at the same time with the
holding of these Synods at Constantinople, the following events occurred
in the Western parts. Maximus, from the island of Britain, rebelled
against the Roman empire, and attacked Gratian, who was then wearied and
exhausted in a war with the Alemanni. <span
id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720) In Italy, Valentinian being still a
minor, Probus, a man of consular dignity, had the chief administration
of affairs, and was at that time prefect of the Prætorium. Justina, the
mother of the young prince, who entertained Arian sentiments, as long as
her husband lived had been unable to molest the Homoousians; but going
to Milan while her son was still young, she manifested great hostility
to Ambrose the bishop, and commanded that he should be banished. <span
id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721) While the people from their excessive
attachment to Ambrose, were offering resistance to those who were
charged with taking him into exile, intelligence was brought that
Gratian had been assassinated by the treachery of the usurper Maximus.
In fact Andragathius, a general under Maximus, having concealed himself
in a litter resembling a couch, which was carried by mules, ordered his
guards to spread a report before him that the litter contained the
Emperor Gratian’s wife. They met the emperor near the city of Lyons in
France just as he had crossed the river: who believing it to be his
wife, and not suspecting any treachery, fell into the hands of his enemy
as a blind man into the ditch; for Andragathius, suddenly springing
forth from the litter, slew him. <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722)
Gratian thus perished in the consulate of Merogaudes and
Saturninus, <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723) in the twenty-fourth
year of his age, and the fifteenth of his reign. When this happened the
Empress Justina’s indignation against Ambrose was repressed. Afterwards
Valentinian most unwillingly, but constrained by the necessity of the
time, admitted Maximus as his colleague in the empire. Probus alarmed at
the power of Maximus, resolved to retreat into the regions of the East:
leaving Italy therefore, he proceeded to Illyricum, and fixed his
residence at Thessalonica a city of Macedonia.

Zosimus, though not inconsistent with that of Socrates, does not contain
the details given by Socrates. Andragathius is simply said to have
pursued Gratian, and overtaking him near the bridge to have slain him.
