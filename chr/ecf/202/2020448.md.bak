<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII</span>.—*Monks of Palestine:
Hesycas, Epiphanius, who was afterwards in Cyprus, Ammonius, and
Silvanus*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Many</span> monastical institutions
flourished in Palestine. <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) Many
of those whom I enumerated under the reign of Constantius were still
cultivating the science. They and their associates attained the summit
of philosophical perfection, and added still greater reputation to their
monasteries; and among them Hesycas, <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) a companion of Hilarion, and
Epiphanius, afterwards bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, deserve to be
particularly noticed. Hesycas devoted himself to a life of <span
id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xxxii-Page_370"></span>philosophy in the same locality where
his master had formerly resided; and Epiphanius <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) fixed his abode near the village of
Besauduc, which was his birthplace, in the government of Eleutheropolis.
Having been instructed from his youth by the most celebrated ascetics,
and having on this account passed the most of his time in Egypt,
Epiphanius became most celebrated in Egypt and Palestine by his
attainments in monastic philosophy, and was chosen by the inhabitants of
Cyprus to act as bishop of the metropolis of their island. Hence he is,
I think, the most revered man under the whole heaven, so to speak; for
he fulfilled his priesthood in the concourse of a large city and in a
seaport; and when he threw himself into civil affairs, he conducted them
with so much virtue that he became known in a little while to all
citizens and every variety of foreigner; to some, because they had seen
the man himself, and had experience of his manner of living; and to
others, who had learned it from these spectators. Before he went to
Cyprus, he resided for some time, during the present reign, in
Palestine.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p6"></span>At the same period in the monasteries,
Salamines, Phuscon, Malachion, and Crispion, four brethren, were highly
distinguished: they practiced philosophy near Bethelia, a village of
Gaza; they were of a resident noble family, and had been instructed in
philosophy by Hilarion. It is related that the brothers were once
journeying homewards, when Malachion was suddenly snatched away and
became invisible; soon afterwards, however, he reappeared and continued
the journey with his brothers. He did not long survive this occurrence,
but died in the flower of his youth. He was not behind men of advanced
age in the philosophy of virtuous life and of piety.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxii-p7"></span>Ammonius lived at a distance of ten
stadia from those last mentioned; he dwelt near Capharcobra, the place
of his birth, a town of Gaza. He was very exact and courageous in
carrying through asceticism. I think that Silvanus, a native of
Palestine, to whom, on account of his high virtue, an angel was once
seen to minister, practiced philosophy about the same time in Egypt.
Then he lived at Mount Sinai, and afterwards founded at Gerari, in the
wady, a very extensive and most noted cœnobium for many good men, over
which the excellent Zacharias subsequently presided.
