<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*Of the Holy Men
who flourished at this Period in Egypt. John, or Amon,* <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) *Benus, Theonas, Copres, Helles,
Elias, Apelles, Isidore, Serapion, Dioscorus, and Eulogius*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxviii-p3.1"></span>As</span> this period was distinguished
by many holy men, <span id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) who devoted
themselves to a life of philosophy, it seems requisite to give some
account of them, for in that time there flourished a very great
abundance of men beloved of God. There was not, it appears, a more
celebrated man in Egypt than John. He had received from God the power of
discerning the future and the most hidden things as clearly as the
ancient prophets, and he had, moreover, the gift of healing those who
suffered with incurable afflictions and diseases. Or was another eminent
man of this period; he had lived in solitude from his earliest youth,
occupying himself continually in singing the praises of God. He
subsisted on herbs and roots, and his drink was water, when he could
find it. In his old age he went, by the command of God, to Thebaïs,
where he presided over several monasteries, nor was he without part in
divine works. By means of prayer alone he expelled diseases and devils.
He knew nothing of letters, nor did he need books to support his memory;
for whatever he received into his mind was never afterwards forgotten.

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p5"></span>Ammon, the leader of the monks called
Tabennesiotians, dwelt in the same region, and was followed by about
three thousand disciples. Benus and Theonas likewise presided over
monastic orders, and possessed the gift of foreknowledge and of
prophecy. It is said that though Theonas was versed in all the learning
of the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans, he practiced silence for
the space of thirty years. Benus was never seen to manifest any signs of
anger, and never heard to swear, or to utter a false, a vain, a rash, or
a useless word.

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p6"></span>Copres, Helles, and Elias also
flourished at this period. It is said that Copres had received from God
the power of healing sickness and divers diseases, and of overcoming
demons. Helles had from his youth upwards been trained in the monastic
life, and he wrought many wonderful works. He could carry fire in his
bosom without burning his clothes. He excited his fellow-monks to the
practice of virtue by representing that with a good conduct, the display
of miracles would follow. Elias, who practiced philosophy near the city
of Antinoüs, was at this period about a hundred and ten years of age;
before this he said he had passed seventy years alone in the desert.
Notwithstanding his advanced age, he was unremitting in the practice of
fasting and courageous discipline.

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p7"></span>Apelles flourished at the same
period, and performed numerous miracles in the Egyptian monasteries,
near the city of Acoris. He at one time worked as a smith, for this was
his trade; and one night the devil undertook to tempt him to
incontinence, by appearing before him in the form of a beautiful woman;
Apelles, however, seized the iron which was heating in the furnace, and
burnt the face of the devil, who screamed like a wild bird and ran away.

<span id="iii.xi.xxviii-p8"></span>Isidore, Serapion, and Dioscorus, at
this period, were among the most celebrated fathers of the monks.
Isidore caused his monastery to be closed, so that no one could obtain
egress or ingress, and supplied the wants of those within the walls.
Serapion lived in the neighborhood of Arsenoites, and had about a
thousand monks under his guidance. He taught all to earn their
provisions by their labors and to provide for others who were poor.
During harvest-time they busied themselves in reaping for pay; they set
aside sufficient corn for their own use, and shared it with the rest of
the monks. Dioscorus had not more than a hundred disciples; he was a
presbyter, and applied himself with great exactness to the duties of his
priesthood; he examined and carefully questioned those who presented
themselves as candidates for participation in the holy mysteries, so
that they might purify their minds and not be without a consciousness of
any evil they might have committed. The presbyter Eulogius was still
more scrupulous in the dispensation of the Divine mysteries. It is said
that, when he was officiating in the priestly office, he could discern
what was in the minds of those who came to him, so that he could clearly
detect sin, and the secret thoughts of each one of his audience. He
excluded from the altar all who had perpetrated crime or formed evil
resolutions, and publicly convicted them of sin; but, on their purifying
themselves by repentance, he again received them into communion.
