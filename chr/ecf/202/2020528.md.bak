id="iii.xiv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Theodosiolus and
Lagodius. The Races of the Vandals and Suevi. Death of Alaric. Flight of
the Tyrants Constantine and Constans*.

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.xii-p2.1"></span>The</span> troops of Constans were shortly
afterwards strengthened by reinforcements, and Didymus and Verinian,
with their wives, were taken prisoners, and were eventually put to
death. <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) Their brothers,
Theodosiolus and Lagodius, who were living in other provinces, fled the
country; the former escaped to Italy, to the Emperor Honorius; the
latter fled to the East, to Theodosius. After these transactions,
Constans returned to his father, after he had posted a guard of his own
soldiers for the road to Spain; for he did not permit the Spaniards to
act as guard, according to the ancient custom, a privilege for which
they had petitioned. This precaution was probably afterwards the cause
of the ruin of the country; for when Constantine was deprived of his
power, the barbarous races of the Vandals, Suevi, and Alani took
confidence and conquered the road, and took possession of many forts and
cities in Spain and Gaul, and arrested the officers of the tyrant.

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p4"></span>In the meantime, Constantine, who still
thought that matters would go according to his purpose, caused his son
to be proclaimed emperor instead of Cæsar, and determined to possess
himself of Italy. With this view, he crossed the Cottian Alps, and
entered Liverona, a city of Liguria. He was on the point of crossing the
Po, when he was compelled to retrace his steps, upon being informed of
the death of Alavicus. This Alavicus was the commander of the troops of
Honorius, and being suspected of conspiring to place the entire Western
government under the domination of Constantine, he was slain when
returning from a procession, in which, according to custom, it was his
office to march in advance of the emperor. Immediately after this
occurrence, the emperor descended from horseback, and publicly returned
thanks to God for having delivered him from one who had openly conspired
against him. Constantine fled and seized Arles, and Constans, his son,
hastened from Spain, and sought refuge in the same city.

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p5"></span>On the decline of the power of
Constantine, the Vandals, Suevi, and Alani eagerly took the Pyrenees
when they heard that it was a prosperous and most abundant region. And
since those who had been entrusted by Constans <span id="page_426">p.
426</span> <span id="iii.xiv.xii-Page_426"></span>with the guard of the
passage had neglected their duty, the invaders passed by into Spain.
