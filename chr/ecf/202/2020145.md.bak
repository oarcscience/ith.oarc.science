id="ii.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Death of Athanasius, and
Elevation of Peter to His See.* <span id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md)

<span id="ii.vii.xx-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xx-p3.1"></span>It</span> must be said that as long as
Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, was alive, the emperor, restrained by
the Providence of God, abstained from molesting Alexandria and Egypt:
indeed he knew very well that the multitude of those who were attached
to Athanasius was very great; and on that account he was careful lest
the public affairs should be hazarded, by the Alexandrians, who are an
irritable race, being excited to sedition. But Athanasius, after being
engaged in so many and such severe conflicts on behalf of the church,
departed this life in the second consulate <span
id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md) of Gratian and Probus, having governed
that church amidst the greatest perils forty-six years. He left as his
successor Peter, a devout and eloquent man.

hence also the death of Athanasius himself in the same year. The later
date is now universally accepted.
