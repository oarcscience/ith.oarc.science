<span id="ii.v.xxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*The Council of Sardica
restores Paul and Athanasius to their Sees; and on the Eastern Emperor’s
Refusal to admit them, the Emperor of the West threatens him with War.*

<span id="ii.v.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> convened at Sardica, as well as
those who had formed a separate council at Philippopolis in Thrace,
having severally performed what they deemed requisite, returned to their
respective cities. From that time, therefore, the Western church was
severed from the Eastern; <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326) and
the boundary of communion between them was the mountain called
Soucis, <span id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327) which divides the
Illyrians from the Thracians. As far as this mountain there was
indiscriminate communion, although there was a difference of faith; but
beyond it they did not commune with one another. Such was the perturbed
condition of the churches at that period. Soon after these transactions,
the emperor of the Western parts informed his brother Constantius of
what had taken place at Sardica, and begged him to restore Paul and
Athanasius to their sees. But as Constantius delayed to carry this
matter into effect, the emperor of the West again wrote to him, giving
him the choice either of re-establishing Paul and Athanasius in their
former dignity, and restoring their churches to them; or, on his failing
to do this, of regarding him as his enemy, and immediately expecting
war. The letter which he addressed to his brother was as follows:

<span id="ii.v.xxii-p5"></span>‘Athanasius and Paul are here with me;
and I am quite satisfied after investigation, that they are persecuted
for the sake of piety. If, therefore, you will pledge yourself to
reinstate them in their sees, and to punish those who have so unjustly
injured them, I will send them to you; but should you refuse to do this,
be assured, that I will myself come thither, and restore them to their
own sees, in spite of your opposition.’

<span id="ii.v.xxii-p3"></span>This separation was only temporary and
must be distinguished from the great schism, which grew slowly and
culminated with the adoption of the expression ‘*filioque’* into the
Apostles’ Creed by the Western church in the eleventh century. On the
various degrees of unity and communion recognized in the ancient church,
see Bingham, *Eccl. Antiq.* Bk. XVI. 1.
