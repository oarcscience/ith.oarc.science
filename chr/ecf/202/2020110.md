<span id="ii.vi.xii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*Of Maris Bishop of
Chalcedon; Julian forbids Christians from entering Literary Pursuits.*

<span id="ii.vi.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.xii-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time, Maris bishop of
Chalcedon in Bithynia being led by the hand into the emperor’s
presence,—for on account of extreme old age he had a disease in his eyes
termed ‘cataract,’—severely rebuked his impiety, apostasy, and atheism.
Julian answered his reproaches by loading him with contumelious
epithets: and he defended himself by words calling him ‘blind.’ ‘You
blind old fool,’ said he, ‘this Galilæan God of yours will never cure
you.’ For he was accustomed to term Christ ‘the Galilæan,’ <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516) and Christians Galilæans. Maris with
still greater boldness replied, ‘I thank God for bereaving me of my
sight, that I might not behold the face of one who has fallen into such
awful impiety.’ The emperor suffered this to pass without farther notice
at that time; but he afterwards had his revenge. Observing that those
who suffered martyrdom under the reign of Diocletian were greatly
honored by the Christians, and knowing that many among them were eagerly
desirous of becoming martyrs, he determined to wreak his vengeance upon
them in some other way. Abstaining therefore from the excessive
cruelties which had been practiced under Diocletian; he did not however
altogether abstain from persecution (for any measures adopted to
disquiet and molest I regard as persecution). This then was the plan he
pursued: he enacted a law <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517) by
which Christians were excluded from the cultivation of literature;
‘lest,’ said he, ‘when they have sharpened their tongue, they should be
able the more readily to meet the arguments of the heathen.’
