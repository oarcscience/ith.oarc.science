<span id="iii.viii.xii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*The Bishops of the
Party of Julius and Hosius held another Session and deposed the Eastern
High Priests, and also made a Formulary of Faith*.

<span id="iii.viii.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xii-p2.1"></span>The</span> adherents of Hosius, <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md) in the meantime, assembled
together, and declared them innocent: Athanasius, because unjust
machinations had been carried on against him by those who had convened
at Tyre; and Marcellus, because he did not hold the opinions with which
he was charged; and Asclepas, because he had been re-established in his
diocese by the vote of Eusebius Pamphilus and of many other judges; that
this was true he proved by the records of the trial; and lastly, Lucius,
because his accusers had fled. They wrote to the parishes of each of the
acquitted, commanding them to receive and recognize their bishops. They
stated that Gregory had not been nominated by them bishop of Alexandria;
nor Basil, bishop of Ancyra; nor Quintianus, bishop of Gaza; and that
they had not received these men into communion, and did not even account
them Christians. They deposed from the episcopates, Theodore, bishop of
Thrace; Narcissus, bishop of Irenopolis; Acacius, bishop of Cæsarea, in
Palestine; Menophantus, bishop of Ephesus; Ursacius, bishop of Sigidunus
in Mœsia; Valens, bishop of Mursia in Pannonia; and George, bishop of
Laodicea, although this latter had not attended the Synod with the
Eastern bishops. They ejected the above-named individuals from the
priesthood and from communion, because they separated the Son from the
substance of the Father, and had received those who had been formerly
deposed on account of their holding the Arian heresy, and had, moreover,
promoted them to the highest offices in the service of God. After they
had excided them for these perversions and decreed them to be aliens to
the Catholic Church, they afterwards wrote to the bishops of every
nation, <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) commanding them to
confirm these decrees, and to be of one mind on doctrinal subjects with
themselves. They likewise compiled another document of faith, which was
more copious than that of Nicæa, although the same thought was carefully
preserved, and very little change was made in the words of that
instrument. Hosius and Protogenes, who held the first rank among the
Western bishops assembled at Sardica, fearing perhaps lest they should
be suspected of making any innovations upon the doctrines of the Nicene
council, wrote to Julius, <span id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md) and
testified that they were firmly attached to these doctrines, but,
pressed by the need of perspicuity, they had to expand the identical
thought, in order that the Arians might not take advantage of the
brevity of the document, to draw those who were unskilled in dialectics
into some absurdity. When what I have related had been transacted by
each party, the conference was dissolved, and the members returned to
their respective homes. This Synod was held during the consulate of
Rufinus and Eusebius, and about eleven years after the death of
Constantine. <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md) There were about
three hundred <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) bishops of
cities in the West, and upwards of seventy-six Eastern bishops, among
whom was Ischyrion, who had been appointed bishop of Mareotis by the
enemies of Athanasius.

nobly adheres to the Faith of the Nicene Council, while the East is
