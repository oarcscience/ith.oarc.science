id="ii.vii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*Abatement of
Persecution against the Christians because of the War with the Goths.*

<span id="ii.vii.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxxv-p2.1"></span>The</span> barbarians having been put into
possession of Thrace, and securely enjoying that Roman province, were
unable to bear their good fortune with moderation; but committing
hostile aggressions upon their benefactors, devastated all Thrace and
the adjacent countries. When these proceedings came to the knowledge of
Valens, he desisted from sending the adherents of the *homoousion* into
banishment; and in great alarm left Antioch, and came to Constantinople,
where also the persecution of the orthodox Christians was for the same
reason come to an end. At the same time Euzoïus, bishop of the Arians at
Antioch, departed this life, in the fifth consulate <span

Valentinian the younger; and Dorotheus was appointed in his place.
