<span id="ii.vi.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Of the Sedition excited at
Alexandria, and how George was slain.*

<span id="ii.vi.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.ii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is now proper to mention what took
place in the churches under the same \[emperor\]. A great disturbance
occurred at Alexandria in consequence of the following circumstance.
There was a place in that city which had long been abandoned to neglect
and filth, wherein the pagans had formerly celebrated their mysteries,
and sacrificed human beings to Mithra. <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) This being empty and otherwise
useless, Constantius had granted to the church of the Alexandrians; and
George wishing to erect a church on the site of it, gave directions that
the place should be cleansed. In the process of clearing it, an
adytum <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) of vast depth was
discovered which unveiled the nature of their heathenish rites: <span
id="page_79">p. 79</span> <span id="ii.vi.ii-Page_79"></span>for there
were found there the skulls of many persons of all ages, who were said
to have been immolated for the purpose of divination by the inspection
of entrails, when the pagans performed these and such like magic arts
whereby they enchanted the souls of men. The Christians on discovering
these abominations in the adytum of the Mithreum, went forth eagerly to
expose them to the view and execration of all; and therefore carried the
skulls throughout the city, in a kind of triumphal procession, for the
inspection of the people. When the pagans of Alexandria beheld this,
unable to bear the insulting character of the act, they became so
exasperated, that they assailed the Christians with whatever weapon
chanced to come to hand, in their fury destroying numbers of them in a
variety of ways: some they killed with the sword, others with clubs and
stones; some they strangled with ropes, others they crucified, purposely
inflicting this last kind of death in contempt of the cross of Christ:
most of them they wounded; and as it generally happens in such a case,
neither friends nor relatives were spared, but friends, brothers,
parents, and children imbrued their hands in each other’s blood.
Wherefore the Christians ceased from cleansing the Mithreum: the pagans
meanwhile having dragged George out of the church, fastened him to a
camel, and when they had torn him to pieces, they burnt him together
with the camel. <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md)

<span id="ii.vi.ii-p5"></span>This George is, according to some
authorities, the St. George of the legend. In its Arian form the legend
represents St. George as warring against the wizard Athanasius; later,
the wizard was transformed to a dragon, and George to an armed knight
slaying the dragon. On other forms and features of the legend, see Smith
& Wace, *Dict. of Christ. Biogr.,* <span class="c13"><span
