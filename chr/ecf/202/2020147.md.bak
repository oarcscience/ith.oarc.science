<span id="ii.vii.xxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Silence of Sabinus on
the Misdeeds of the Arians; Flight of Peter to Rome; Massacre of the
Solitaries at the Instigation of the Arians.*

<span id="ii.vii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Of</span> the outrages perpetrated upon the
installation of Lucius, and the treatment of those who were ejected,
both in the courts and outside of the courts, and how some were
subjected to a variety of tortures, and others sent into exile even
after this excruciating process, Sabinus takes not the slightest notice.
In fact, being half disposed <span id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xxii-Page_106"></span>to Arianism himself, he purposely veils
the atrocities of his friends. Peter, however, has exposed them, in the
letters he addressed to all the churches, when he had escaped from
prison. For this \[bishop\] having managed to escape from prison, fled
to Damasus, bishop of Rome. The Arians though not very numerous,
becoming thus possessed of the Alexandrian churches soon after obtained
an imperial edict directing the governor of Egypt to expel not only from
Alexandria but even out of the country, the favorers of the ‘homoousian’
doctrine, and all such as were obnoxious to Lucius. After this they
assailed and disturbed and terribly harassed the monastic institutions
in the desert; armed men rushed in the most ferocious manner upon those
who were utterly defenceless, and who would not lift an arm to repel
their violence: so that numbers of unresisting victims were in this
manner slaughtered with a degree of wanton cruelty beyond description.
