<span id="ii.v.xlv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV</span>.—*The Heresy of
Macedonius.*

<span id="ii.v.xlv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xlv-p2.1"></span>Macedonius</span> on being ejected from
Constantinople, bore his condemnation ill and became restless; he
therefore associated himself with the other faction that had deposed
Acacius and his party at Seleucia, and sent a deputation to Sophronius
and Eleusius, to encourage them to adhere to that creed which was first
promulgated at Antioch, and afterwards confirmed at Seleucia, proposing
to give it the counterfeit <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) name
of the ‘*homoiousian*’ creed. <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) By
this means he drew around him a great number of adherents, who from him
are still denominated ‘Macedonians.’ And although such as dissented from
the Acacians at the Seleucian Synod had not previously used the term
*homoiousios,* yet from that period they distinctly asserted it. There
was, however, a popular report that this <span id="page_74">p. 74</span>
<span id="ii.v.xlv-Page_74"></span>term did not originate with
Macedonius, but was the invention rather of Marathonius, who a little
before had been set over the church at Nicomedia; on which account the
maintainers of this doctrine were also called ‘Marathonians.’ To this
party Eustathius joined himself, who for the reasons before stated had
been ejected from the church at Sebastia. But when Macedonius began to
deny the Divinity of the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, Eustathius said: ‘I
can neither admit that the Holy Spirit is God, nor can I dare affirm him
to be a creature.’ For this reason those who hold the *homoousion* of
the Son call these heretics ‘*Pneumatomachi.*’ <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) By what means these Macedonians became
so numerous in the Hellespont, I shall state in its proper place. <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) The Acacians meanwhile became
extremely anxious that another Synod should be convened at Antioch, in
consequence of having changed their mind respecting their former
assertion of the likeness ‘in all things’ of the Son to the Father. A
small number of them therefore assembled in the following
consulate <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) which was that of
Taurus and Florentius, at Antioch in Syria, where the emperor was at
that time residing, Euzoïus being bishop. A discussion was then renewed
on some of those points which they had previously determined, in the
course of which they declared that the term ‘*homoios*’ ought to be
erased from the form of faith which had been published both at Ariminum
and Constantinople; and they no longer concealed but openly declared
that the Son was altogether unlike the Father, not merely in relation to
his essence, but even as it respected his will; asserting boldly also,
as Arius had already done, that he was made of nothing. Those in that
city who favored the heresy of Aëtius, gave their assent to this
opinion; from which circumstance in addition to the general appellation
of Arians, they were also termed ‘Anomœans,’ <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) and ‘Exucontians,’ <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) by those at Antioch who embraced the
homoousian, who nevertheless were at that time divided among themselves
on account of Meletius, as I have before observed. Being therefore
questioned by them, how they dared to affirm that the Son is unlike the
Father, and has his existence from nothing, after having acknowledged
him ‘God of God’ in their former creed? they endeavored to elude this
objection by such fallacious subterfuges as these. ‘The expression,
“*God of God,*”’ said they, ‘is to be understood in the same sense as
the words of the apostle, <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) “*but
all things of God.*” Wherefore the Son is *of God,* as being one of
these *all things:* and it is for this reason the words “according to
the Scriptures” are added in the draught of the creed.’ The author of
this sophism was George bishop of Laodicea, who being unskilled in such
phrases, was ignorant of the manner in which Origen had formerly
explained these peculiar expressions of the apostle, having thoroughly
investigated the matter. But notwithstanding these evasive cavilings,
they were unable to bear the reproach and contumely they had drawn upon
themselves, and fell back upon the creed which they had before put forth
at Constantinople; and so each one retired to his own district. George
returning to Alexandria, resumed his authority over the churches there,
Athanasius still not having made his appearance. Those in that city who
were opposed to his sentiments he persecuted; and conducting himself
with great severity and cruelty, he rendered himself extremely odious to
the people. At Jerusalem Arrenius <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) was placed over the church instead of
Cyril: we may also remark that Heraclius was ordained bishop there after
him, and after him Hilary. At length, however, Cyril returned to
Jerusalem, and was again invested with the presidency over the church
there. About the same time another heresy sprang up, which arose from
the following circumstance.
