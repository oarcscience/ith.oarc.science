<span id="ii.x.xlv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV</span>.—*The Body of John
Chrysostom transferred to Constantinople, and placed in the Church of
the Apostles by the Emperor at the Instigation of Proclus.*

<span id="ii.x.xlv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xlv-p2.1"></span>Not</span> long after this, Proclus the bishop
brought back to the Church those who had separated themselves from it on
account of Bishop John’s deposition, he having soothed the irritation by
a prudent expedient. What this was we must now recount. Having obtained
the emperor’s permission, he removed the body of John from Comana, where
it was buried, to Constantinople, in the thirty-fifth year after his
deposition. And when he had carried it in solemn procession through the
city, he deposited it with much honor in the church termed *The
Apostles.* By this means the admirers of that prelate were conciliated,
and again associated in communion with the \[catholic\] Church. This
happened on the 27th of January, in the sixteenth consulate of the
Emperor Theodosius. <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035) But it
astonishes me that envy, which has been vented against Origen since his
death, has spared John. For the former was excommunicated by Theophilus
about two hundred years after his decease; while the latter was restored
to communion by Proclus in the thirty-fifth year after his death! So
different was Proclus from Theophilus. And men of observation and
intelligence cannot be deceived in reference to how these things were
done and are continually being done.
