<span id="iii.x.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*He prohibited the
Christians from the Markets and from the Judicial Seats and from Sharing
in Greek Education. Resistance of Basil the Great, Gregory the
Theologian, and Apolinarius to this Decree. They rapidly translate the
Scripture into Greek Modes of Expression. Apolinarius and Gregory
Nazianzen do this more than Basil, the one in a Rhetorical Vein, the
other in Epic Style and in Imitation of every Poet*.

<span id="iii.x.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xviii-p2.1"></span>Julian</span> entertained the same
sentiments as those above described towards all Christians, as he
manifested whenever an opportunity was offered. Those who refused to
sacrifice to the gods, although perfectly blameless in other respects,
were deprived of the rights of citizenship, <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) and of the privilege of
participating in assemblies, and in the forum; and he would not allow
them to be judges or magistrates, or to share in offices.

<span id="iii.x.xviii-p4"></span>He forbade the children of Christians
from frequenting the public schools, and from being instructed in the
writings of the Greek poets and authors. <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md) He entertained great resentment
against Apolinarius the Syrian, a man of manifold knowledge and
philological attainments, against Basil and Gregory, natives of
Cappadocia, the most celebrated orators of the time, and against other
learned and eloquent men, of whom some were attached to the Nicene
doctrines, and others to the dogmas of Arius. His sole motive for
excluding the children of Christian parents from instruction in the
learning of the Greeks, was because he considered such studies conducive
to the acquisition of argumentative and persuasive power. Apolinarius,
therefore, employed his great learning and ingenuity in the production
of a heroic epic on the antiquities of the Hebrews to the reign of Saul,
as a substitute for the poem of Homer. He divided this work into
twenty-four parts, to each of which he appended the name of one of the
letters of the Greek alphabet, according to their number and order. He
also wrote comedies in imitation of Menander, tragedies resembling those
of Euripides, and odes on the model of Pindar. In short, taking themes
of the entire circle of knowledge from the Scriptures, he produced
within a very brief space of time, a set of works which in manner,
expression, character, and arrangement are well approved as similar to
the Greek literatures and which were equal in number and in force. Were
it not for the extreme partiality with which the productions of
antiquity are regarded, I doubt not but that the writings of Apolinarius
would be held in as much estimation as those of the ancients. <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md)

<span id="iii.x.xviii-p7"></span>The comprehensiveness of his intellect
is more especially to be admired; for he excelled in every branch of
literature, whereas ancient writers were proficient only in one. He
wrote a very remarkable work entitled “The Truth” <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) against the emperor and the pagan
philosophers, in which he clearly proved, without any appeal to the
authority of Scripture, that they were far from having attained right
opinions of God. The emperor, for the purpose of casting ridicule on
works of this nature, wrote to the bishops in the following words: “I
have read, I have understood, and I have condemned.” <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) To this they sent the following
reply, “You have read, but you have not understood; for, had you
understood, you would not have condemned.”

<span id="iii.x.xviii-p10"></span>Some have attributed this letter to
Basil, the president of the church in Cappadocia, and perhaps not
without reason; but whether dictated by him or by another, it fully
displays the magnanimity and learning of the writer.
