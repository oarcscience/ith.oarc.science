<span id="iii.vi.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*Two Philosophers
are converted to the Faith by the Simplicity of Two Old Men with whom
they hold a Disputation*.

<span id="iii.vi.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xviii-p2.1"></span>While</span> these disputations were being
carried on, certain of the pagan philosophers became desirous of taking
part in them; some, because they wished for information as to the
doctrine that was inculcated; and others, because, feeling incensed
against the Christians on account of the recent suppression of the pagan
religion, they wished to convert the inquiry about doctrine into a
strife about words, so as to introduce dissensions among them, and to
make them appear as holding contradictory opinions. It is related that
one of these philosophers, priding himself on his acknowledged
superiority of eloquence, began to ridicule the priests, and thereby
roused the indignation of a simple old man, highly esteemed <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span id="iii.vi.xviii-Page_254"></span>as a
confessor, who, although unskilled in logical refinements and wordiness,
undertook to oppose him. The less serious of those who knew the
confessor, raised a laugh <span id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) at
his expense for engaging in such an undertaking; but the more thoughtful
felt anxious lest, in opposing so eloquent a man, he should only render
himself ridiculous; yet his influence was so great, and his reputation
so high among them, that they could not forbid his engaging in the
debate; and he accordingly delivered himself in the following terms: “In
the name of Jesus Christ, O philosopher, hearken to me. There is one
God, the maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and
invisible. He made all things by the power of the Word, and established
them by the holiness of His Spirit. The Word, whom we call the Son of
God, seeing that man was sunk in error and living like unto the beasts
pitied him, and vouchsafed to be born of woman, to hold intercourse with
men, and to die for them. And He will come again to judge each of us as
to the deeds of this present life. We believe these things to be true
with all simplicity. Do not, therefore, expend your labor in vain by
striving to disprove facts which can only be understood by faith or by
scrutinizing the manner in which these things did or did not come to
pass. Answer me, dost thou believe?” The philosopher, astonished at what
had occurred, replied, “I believe”; and having thanked the old man for
having overcome him in argument, he began to teach the same doctrines to
others. He exhorted those who still held his former sentiments to adopt
the views he had embraced, assuring them on oath, that he had been
impelled to embrace Christianity by a certain inexplicable impulse.

<span id="iii.vi.xviii-p4"></span>It is said that a similar miracle was
performed by Alexander, who governed the church of Constantinople. When
Constantine returned to Byzantium, certain philosophers came to him to
complain of the innovations in religion, and particularly of his having
introduced a new form of worship into the state, contrary to that
followed by his forefathers, and by all who were formerly in power,
whether among the Greeks or the Romans. They likewise desired to hold a
disputation on the doctrine with Alexander the bishop; and he, although
unskilled in such argumentative contests, and perhaps persuaded by his
life, seeing that he was an excellent and good man, accepted the
struggle at the command of the emperor. When the philosophers were
assembled, since every one wished to engage in the discussion, he
requested that one whom they esteemed worthy might be chosen as
spokesman, while the others were to remain silent. When one of the
philosophers began to open the debate, Alexander said to him, “I command
thee in the name of Jesus Christ not to speak.” The man was
instantaneously silenced. It is then right to consider whether it is a
greater miracle that a man, and he a philosopher, should so easily be
silenced by a word, or that a stone-wall should be cleft by the power of
a word, which miracle I have heard some attribute to Julian, surnamed
the Chaldean. <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) I have
understood that these events happened in the way above narrated.

<span id="iii.vi.xviii-p5"></span>Suidas says he was a philosopher, and
the father of Julian, called the Theurgist. He was the author of a work
concerning demons, in four books. The son, who flourished under Marcus
Aurelius, was so skilled in the magic art, that he called down rain from
heaven, when the Roman soldiers were perishing from thirst. Arnuphis, an
Egyptian philosopher, was said to have wrought a similar miracle.
Suidas, s. v.
