<span id="ii.ix.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—</span>*Death of Nectarius and
Ordination of John.*

<span id="ii.ix.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.iii-p2.1"></span>A short</span> time after Nectarius <span
id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) also, bishop of Constantinople died,
during the consulate of Cæsarius and Atticus, <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) on the 27th of September. A contest
thereupon immediately arose respecting the appointment of a successor,
some proposing one person, and some another: at length however it was
determined to send for John, <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) a
presbyter of the church at Antioch, for there was a report that he was
very instructive, and at the same time eloquent. By the general consent
therefore of both the clergy and laity, he was summoned very soon
afterwards to Constantinople by the Emperor Arcadius: and to render the
ordination more authoritative and imposing, several prelates were
requested to be present, among whom also was Theophilus bishop of
Alexandria. <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) This person did
everything he could to detract from John’s reputation, being desirous of
promoting to that see, Isidore <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) a
presbyter of his own church, to whom he was greatly attached, on account
of a very delicate and perilous affair which Isidore had undertaken to
serve his interests. What this was I must now unfold. While the Emperor
Theodosius was preparing to attack the usurper Maximus, Theodosius sent
Isidore with gifts giving twofold letters, and enjoining him to present
both the gifts and the proper letters to him who should become the
victor. In accordance with these injunctions Isidore on his arrival at
Rome awaited there the event of the war. But this business did not long
remain a secret: for a reader who accompanied him privately sequestered
the letters; upon which Isidore in great alarm returned to Alexandria.
This was the reason why Theophilus so warmly favored Isidore. The court
however gave the preference to John: and inasmuch as many had revived
the accusations against Theophilus, and prepared for presentation to the
bishops then convened memorials of various charges, Eutropius <span
id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) the chief officer of the imperial
bed-chamber collected these documents, and showed them to Theophilus,
bidding him ‘choose between ordaining John, and undergoing a trial on
the charges made against him.’ Theophilus terrified at this alternative,
consented to ordain John. Accordingly John was invested with the
episcopal dignity on the 26th of February, under the following
consulate, <span id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) which the Emperor
Honorius celebrated with public games at Rome, and Eutychian, then
Prætorian prefect, at Constantinople. But since the man is famous, both
for the writings he has left, and the many troubles he fell into, it is
proper that I should not pass over his affairs in silence, but to relate
as compendiously as possible whence he was, and from what ancestry; also
the particulars of his elevation to the episcopate, and the means by
which he was subsequently degraded; and finally how he was more honored
after his death, than he had been during his life.
