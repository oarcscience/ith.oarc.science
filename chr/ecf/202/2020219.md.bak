<span id="ii.x.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Character and Conduct of
Atticus Bishop of Constantinople.*

<span id="ii.x.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.ii-p2.1"></span>When</span> Theodosius the emperor was in the
eighth year of his age, Atticus was in the third year of his presidency
over the church at Constantinople, a man as we have by anticipation
said <span id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md) distinguished alike for his
learning, piety, and discretion, wherefore it came about that the
churches under his episcopate attained a very flourishing condition. For
he not only united those of ‘the household of faith,’ <span
id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906.md) but also by his prudence called forth
the admiration of the heretics, whom indeed he by no means desired to
harass; but if he sometimes was obliged to impress them with the fear of
himself, he soon afterward showed himself mild and clement toward them.
But indeed he did not neglect his studies; for he assiduously labored in
perusing the writings of the ancients, and often spent whole nights in
the task; and thus he could not be confused by the reasonings of the
philosophers, and the fallacious subtleties of the sophists. Besides
this he was affable and entertaining in conversation, and ever ready to
sympathize with the afflicted: and in a word, to sum up his excellences
in the apostle’s saying, ‘He was made all things to all men.’ <span
id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907.md) Formerly while a presbyter, he had
been accustomed, after composing his sermons, to commit them to memory,
and then recite them in the church: but by diligent application he
acquired confidence and made his instruction extemporaneous and
eloquent. His discourses however were not such as to be received with
much applause by his auditors, nor to deserve to be committed to
writing. Let these particulars respecting his talents, erudition, and
manners suffice. We must now proceed to relate such things as are worthy
of record, that happened in his time.
