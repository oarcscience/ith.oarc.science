<span id="ii.v.xl-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL</span>.—*Acacius, Bishop of Cæsarea,
dictates a new Form of Creed in the Synod at Seleucia.*

<span id="ii.v.xl-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xl-p2.1"></span>Acacius</span> and his adherents criticised
what was done: because, that is to say, they closed the church doors and
thus affixed their signatures; declaring that ‘all such secret
transactions were justly to be suspected, and had no validity whatever.’
These objections he made because he was anxious to bring forward another
exposition of the faith drawn up by himself, which he had already
submitted to the governors Leonas and Lauricius, and was now intent on
getting it alone confirmed and established, instead of that which had
been subscribed. The second day was thus occupied with nothing else but
exertions on his part to effect this object. On the third day Leonas
endeavored to produce an amicable meeting of both parties; Macedonius of
Constantinople, and also Basil of Ancyra, having arrived during its
course. But when the Acacians found that both the parties had come to
the same position, they refused to meet; saying <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> <span id="ii.v.xl-Page_69"></span>that not only those who had
before been deposed, but also such as were at present under any
accusation, ought to be excluded from the assembly.’ And as after much
cavilling on both sides, this opinion prevailed; those who lay under any
charge went out of the council, and the party of Acacius entered in
their places. Leonas then said that a document had been put into his
hand by Acacius, to which he desired to call their attention: but he did
not state that it was the drought of a creed, which in some particulars
covertly, and in others unequivocally contradicted the former. When
those present became silent, thinking that the document contained
something else besides an exposition of a creed, the following creed
composed by Acacius, together with its preamble, was read.

<span id="ii.v.xl-p3"></span>’We having yesterday assembled by the
emperor’s command at Seleucia, a city of Isauria, on the 27th day of
September, exerted ourselves to the utmost, with all moderation, to
preserve the peace of the church, and to determine doctrinal questions
on prophetic and evangelical authority, so as to sanction nothing in the
ecclesiastic confession of faith at variance with the sacred Scriptures,
as our Emperor Constantius most beloved of God has ordered. But inasmuch
as certain individuals in the Synod have acted injuriously toward
several of us, preventing some from expressing their sentiments, and
excluding others from the council against their wills; and at the same
time have introduced such as have been deposed, and persons who were
ordained contrary to the ecclesiastical canon, so that the Synod has
presented a scene of tumult and disorder, of which the most illustrious
Leonas, the Comes, and the most eminent Lauricius, governor of the
province, have been eye-witnesses, we are therefore under the necessity
of making this declaration. That we do not repudiate the faith which was
ratified at the consecration of the church at Antioch; <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) for we give it our decided preference,
because it received the concurrence of our fathers who were assembled
there to consider some controverted points. Since, however, the terms
*homoousion* and *homoiousion* have in time past troubled the minds of
many, and still continue to disquiet them; and moreover that a new term
has recently been coined by some who assert the *anomoion* of the Son to
the Father: we reject the first two, as expressions which are not found
in the Scriptures; but we utterly anathematize the last, and regard such
as countenance its use, as alienated from the church. We distinctly
acknowledge the *homoion* of the Son to the Father, in accordance with
what the apostle has declared concerning him, <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) “Who is the image of the invisible
God.”

<span id="ii.v.xl-p6"></span>‘We confess then, and believe in one God
the Father Almighty, the Maker of heaven and earth, and of things
visible and invisible. We believe also in his Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
who was begotten of him without passion before all ages, God the Word,
the only-begotten of God, the Light, the Life, the Truth, the Wisdom:
through whom all things were made which are in the heavens and upon the
earth, whether visible or invisible. We believe that he took flesh of
the holy Virgin Mary, at the end of the ages, in order to abolish sin;
that he was made man, suffered for our sin, and rose again, and was
taken up into the heavens, to sit at the right hand of the Father,
whence he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. We
believe also in the Holy Spirit, whom our Lord and Saviour has
denominated the Comforter, and whom he sent to his disciples after his
departure, according to his promise: by whom also he sanctifies all
believers in the church, who are baptized in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Those who preach anything contrary to
this creed, we regard as aliens from the catholic church.’

<span id="ii.v.xl-p7"></span>This was the declaration of faith proposed
by Acacius, and subscribed by himself and as many as adhered to his
opinion, the number of whom we have already given. When this had been
read, Sophronius bishop of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, thus expressed
himself: ‘If to express a separate opinion day after day, be received as
the exposition of the faith, we shall never arrive at any accurate
understanding of the truth.’ These were the words of Sophronius. And I
firmly believe, that if the predecessors of these prelates, as well as
their successors, had entertained similar sentiments in reference to the
Nicene creed, all polemical debates would have been avoided; nor would
the churches have been agitated by such violent and irrational
disturbances. However let those judge who are capable of understanding
how these things are. At that time after many remarks on all sides had
been made both in reference to this doctrinal statement, and in relation
to the parties accused, the assembly was dissolved. On the fourth day
they all again met in the same place, and resumed their proceedings in
the same contentious spirit as before. On this occasion Acacius
expressed himself in these words: ‘Since the Nicene creed has been
altered not once only, but frequently, there is no hindrance to our
publishing another at this time.’ To which Eleusius bishop of Cyzicus,
<span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span
id="ii.v.xl-Page_70"></span>replied: ‘The Synod is at present convened
not to learn what it had no previous knowledge of, nor to receive a
creed which it had not assented to before, but to confirm the faith of
the fathers, from which it should never recede, either in life or
death.’ Thus Eleusius opposing Acacius spoke meaning by ‘the faith of
the fathers,’ that creed which had been promulgated at Antioch. But
surely he too might have been fairly answered in this way: ‘How is it O
Eleusius, that you call those convened at Antioch “the fathers,” seeing
that you do not recognize those who were their fathers? The framers of
the Nicene creed, by whom the *homoousian* faith was acknowledged, have
a far higher claim to the title of “the fathers”; both as having the
priority in point of time, and also because those assembled at Antioch
were by them invested with the sacerdotal office. Now if those at
Antioch have disowned their own fathers, those who follow them are
unconsciously following parricides. Besides how can they have received a
legitimate ordination from those whose faith they pronounce unsound and
impious? If those, however, who constituted the Nicene Synod had not the
Holy Spirit which is imparted by the imposition of hands, <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) those at Antioch have not duly
received the priesthood: for how could they have received it from those
who had not the power of conferring it?’ Such considerations as these
might have been submitted to Eleusius in reply to his objections. But
they then proceeded to another question, connected with the assertion
made by Acacius in his exposition of the faith, ‘that the Son was like
the Father’; enquiring of one another in what this resemblance
consisted. The Acacian party affirmed that the Son was like the Father
as it respected his will only, and not his ‘substance’ or ‘essence’; but
the rest maintained that the likeness extended to both essence and will.
In altercations on this point, the whole day was consumed; and Acacius,
being confuted by his own published works, in which he had asserted that
‘the Son is in all things like the Father,’ his opponents asked him ‘how
do you now deny the likeness of the Son to the Father as to his
“essence”?’ Acacius in reply said, that ‘no author, ancient or modern,
was ever condemned out of his own writings.’ As they kept on their
discussion on this matter to a most tedious extent, with much
acrimonious feeling and subtlety of argument, but without any approach
to unity of judgment, Leonas arose and dissolved the council: and this
was the conclusion of the Synod at Seleucia. For on the following day
\[Leonas\] being urged to do so would not again meet with them. ‘I have
been deputed by the emperor,’ said he, ‘to attend a council where
unanimity was expected to prevail: but since you can by no means come to
a mutual understanding, I can no longer be present: go therefore to the
church, if you please, and indulge in vain babbling there.’ The Acacian
faction conceiving this decision to be advantageous to themselves, also
refused to meet with the others. The adverse party left alone met in the
church and requested the attendance of those who followed Acacius, that
cognizance might be taken of the case of Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem: for
that prelate had been accused long before, on what grounds however I am
unable to state. He had even been deposed, because owing to fear, he had
not made his appearance during two whole years, after having been
repeatedly summoned in order that the charges against him might be
investigated. Nevertheless, when he was deposed, he sent a written
notification to those who had condemned him, that he should appeal to a
higher jurisdiction: and to this appeal the emperor Constantius gave his
sanction. Cyril was thus the first and indeed only clergyman who
ventured to break through ecclesiastical usage, by becoming an
appellant, in the way commonly done in the secular courts of
judicature: <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) and he was now
present at Seleucia, ready to be put upon his trial; on this account the
other bishops invited the Acacian party to take their places in the
assembly, that in a general council a definite judgment might be
pronounced on the case of those who were arraigned: for they cited
others also charged with various misdemeanors to appear before them at
the same time, who to protect themselves had sought refuge among the
partisans of Acacius. When therefore that faction persisted in their
refusal to meet, after being repeatedly summoned, the bishops deposed
Acacius himself, together with George of Alexandria, Uranius of Tyre,
Theodulus of Chæretapi in Phrygia, Theodosius of Philadelphia in Lydia,
Evagrius of the island of Mytilene, Leontius of Tripolis in Lydia, and
Eudoxius who had formerly been bishop of Germanica, but had afterwards
insinuated himself into the bishopric of Antioch in Syria. They also
deposed Patrophilus for contumacy, in not having presented himself to
answer a charge preferred against him by a presbyter named Dorotheus.
These they deposed: they also excommunicated Asterius, Eusebius,
Abgarus, Basilicus, Phœbus, Fidelis, Eutychius, Magnus, and Eustathius;
determining that they should <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="ii.v.xl-Page_71"></span>not be restored to communion, until they
made such a defense as would clear them from the imputations under which
they lay. This being done, they addressed explanatory letters to each of
the churches whose bishops had been deposed. Anianus was then
constituted bishop of Antioch instead of Eudoxius: but the Acacians
having soon after apprehended him, he was delivered into the hands of
Leonas and Lauricius, by whom he was sent into exile. The bishops who
had ordained him being incensed on this account, lodged protests against
the Acacian party with Leonas and Lauricius, in which they openly
charged them with having violated the decisions of the Synod. Finding
that no redress could be obtained by this means, they went to
Constantinople to lay the whole matter before the emperor.
