id="iii.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*The Reason why under
Constantine, the Name of Christ was spread throughout the Whole World*.

<span id="iii.vii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.vi-p2.1"></span>The</span> church having been in this manner
spread throughout the whole Roman world, religion was introduced even
among the barbarians themselves. <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) The tribes on both sides of the
Rhine were Christianized, as likewise the Celts and the Gauls who dwelt
upon the most distant shores of the ocean; the Goths, too, and such
tribes as were contiguous to them, who formerly dwelt on either of the
high shores of the Danube, had long shared in the Christian faith, and
had changed into a gentler and more rational observance. Almost all the
barbarians had professed to hold the Christian doctrine in honor, from
the time of the wars between the Romans and foreign tribes, under the
government of Gallienus and the emperors who succeeded him. For when an
unspeakable multitude of mixed nations passed over from Thrace into Asia
and overran it, and when other barbarians from the various regions did
the same things to the adjacent Romans, many priests of Christ who had
been taken captive, dwelt among these tribes; and during their residence
among them, healed the sick, and cleansed those who were possessed of
demons, by the name of Christ only, and by <span id="page_263">p.

God; moreover they led <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) a
blameless life, and excited envy by their virtues. The barbarians,
amazed at the conduct and wonderful works of these men, thought that it
would be prudent on their part, and pleasing to the Deity, if they
should imitate those whom they saw were better; and, like them, would
render homage to God. When teachers as to what should be done, had been
proposed to them, the people were taught and baptized, and subsequently
were gathered into churches.
