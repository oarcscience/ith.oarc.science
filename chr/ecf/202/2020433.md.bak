<span id="iii.xi.xvii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Friendship of Basil
and of Gregory, the Theologian; being Peers in Wisdom, they defend the
Nicene Doctrines*.

<span id="iii.xi.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xvii-p2.1"></span>Basil</span> and Gregory were
contemporaries, and they were recognized to be equally intent, so to
speak, upon the cultivation of the virtues. <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md) They <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) had both studied in their youth at
Athens, under Himerius and Proæresius, the most approved sophists of the
age; and afterwards at Antioch, under Libanius, the Syrian. But as they
subsequently conceived a contempt for sophistry and the study of the
law, they determined to study philosophy according to the law of the
Church. After having spent some time in the pursuit of the sciences,
taught by pagan philosophers, they entered upon the study of the
commentaries which Origen and the best approved authors who lived before
and after his time, have written in explanation of the Sacred
Scriptures.

<span id="iii.xi.xvii-p5"></span>They rendered great assistance to those
who, like themselves, maintained the Nicene doctrines, for they manfully
opposed the dogmas of the Arians, proving that these heretics did not
rightly understand either the data upon which they proceeded, nor the
opinions of Origen, upon which they mainly depended. These two holy men
divided the perils of their undertaking, either by mutual agreement, or,
as I have been informed, by lot. The cities in the neighborhood of
Pontus fell to the lot of Basil; and here he founded numerous
monasteries, and, by teaching the people, he persuaded them to hold like
views with himself. After the death of his father, Gregory acted as
bishop of the small city of Nazianzus, <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) but resided on that account in a
variety of places, and especially at Constantinople. Not long after he
was appointed by the vote of many priests to act as president of the
people there; for there was then neither bishop nor church in
Constantinople, and the doctrines of the council of Nicæa were almost
extinct.
