<span id="ii.ix.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Conflict between the
Constantinopolitans and Alexandrians on Account of Heraclides; Flight of
Theophilus and the Bishops of his Party.*

<span id="ii.ix.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xviii-p2.1"></span>In</span> the first place, then, Theophilus
attempted to investigate the case of the ordination of Her<span
id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span
id="ii.ix.xviii-Page_150"></span>aclides, <span
id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) that thereby he might if possible find
occasion of again deposing John. Heraclides was not present at this
scrutiny. He was nevertheless judged in his absence, on the charge of
having unjustly beaten some persons, and afterwards dragged them in
chains through the midst of the city of Ephesus. As John and his
adherents remonstrated against the injustice of passing sentence upon an
absent person, the Alexandrians contended that they ought to hear the
accusers of Heraclides, although he was not present. A sharp contest
therefore ensued between the Alexandrians and the Constantinopolitans,
and a riot arose whereby many persons were wounded, and some were
killed. Theophilus, seeing what was done, fled to Alexandria without
ceremony; and the other bishops, except the few who supported John,
followed his example, and returned to their respective sees. After these
transactions, Theophilus was degraded, in every one’s estimation: but
the odium attached to him was exceedingly increased by the shameless way
in which he continued to read Origen’s works. And when he was asked why
he thus countenanced what he had publicly condemned, he replied,
‘Origen’s books are like a meadow enameled with flowers of every kind.
If, therefore, I chance to find a beautiful one among them, I cull it:
but whatever appears to me to be thorny, I step over, as that which
would prick.’ But Theophilus gave this answer without reflecting on the
saying of the wise Solomon, <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) that
‘the words of the wise are as goads’; and those who are pricked by the
precepts they contain, ought not to kick against them. For these reasons
then Theophilus was held in contempt by all men. Dioscorus bishop of
Hermopolis, one of those termed ‘the Tall Monks,’ died a short time
after the flight of Theophilus, and was honored with a magnificent
funeral, being interred in the church at ‘The Oak,’ where the Synod was
convened on John’s account. John meanwhile was sedulously employed in
preaching. He ordained Serapion bishop of Heraclea in Thrace, on whose
account the odium against himself had been raised. Not long after the
following events occurred.
