id="iii.xi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*Account of the Eighty
Pious Delegates in Nicomedia, whom Valens burned with the Vessel in
Mid-Sea*.

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xiv-p2.1"></span>The</span> Arians, as is customary with the
prosperous, because more insolent, <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) persecuted unmercifully all
Christians whose religious sentiments were opposed to their own.

<span id="iii.xi.xiv-p4"></span>These Christians being exposed to bodily
injuries, and betrayed to magistrates and prisons, and finding
themselves moreover gradually impoverished by the frequent fines, were
at length compelled to appeal for redress to the emperor. Although
exceedingly angry, the emperor did not openly manifest any wrath, but
secretly commanded the prefect to seize and slay the whole deputation.
But the prefect, being apprehensive that a whole popular insurrection
would be excited if he were to put so many good and religious men to
death without any of the forms of justice, pretended that they were to
be sent into exile, and under this pretext compelled them to embark on
board a ship, to which they assented with the most perfect resignation.
When they had sailed to about the center of the bay, which was called
Astacius, the sailors, according to the orders they had received, set
fire to the vessel and leaped into the tender. A wind arising, the ship
was blown along to Dacibiza, a place on the sea-coast of Bithynia; but
no sooner had it neared the shore, than it was utterly consumed with all
the men on board.
