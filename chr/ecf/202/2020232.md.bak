<span id="ii.x.xv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*Of Hypatia the Female
Philosopher.*

<span id="ii.x.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xv-p2.1"></span>There</span> was a woman at Alexandria named
Hypatia, <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md) daughter of the
philosopher Theon, who made such attainments in literature and science,
as to far surpass all the philosophers of her own time. Having succeeded
to the school of Plato and Plotinus, she explained the principles of
philosophy to her auditors, many of whom came from a distance to receive
her instructions. On account of the self-possession and ease of manner,
which she had acquired in consequence of the cultivation of her mind,
she not unfrequently appeared in public in presence of the magistrates.
Neither did she feel abashed in coming to an assembly of men. For all
men on account of her extraordinary dignity and virtue admired her the
more. Yet even she fell a victim to the political jealousy which at that
time prevailed. For as she had frequent interviews with Orestes, it was
calumniously reported among the Christian populace, that it was she who
prevented Orestes from being reconciled to the bishop. Some of them
therefore, hurried away by a fierce and bigoted zeal, whose ringleader
was a reader named Peter, waylaid her returning home, and dragging her
from her carriage, they took her to the church called *Cæsareum,* where
they completely stripped her, and then murdered her with tiles. <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md) After tearing her body in pieces, they
took her mangled limbs to a place called Cinaron, and there burnt them.
This affair brought not the least opprobrium, not only upon Cyril, <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md) but also upon the whole Alexandrian
church. And surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of
Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions
of that sort. This happened in the month of March during Lent, in the
fourth year of Cyril’s episcopate, under the tenth consulate of
Honorius, and the sixth of Theodosius. <span

<span id="ii.x.xv-p3"></span>The following incident has been popularized
by Charles Kingsley in his well-known novel of *Hypatia,* which has,
however, the accessory aim of antagonizing the over-estimation of early
Christianity by Dr. Pusey and his followers. The original sources for
the history of Hypatia, besides the present chapter, are the letters of
her pupil Synesius, and Philostorgius, VIII. 9. Cf. also Wernsdoff, *de
Hypatia, philosopha Alex.* diss. 4, Viteb. 1748.

<span id="ii.x.xv-p5"></span>The responsibility of Cyril in this affair
has been variously estimated by different historians. Walch, Gibbon, and
Milman incline to hold him guilty. J. C. Robertson ascribes him indirect
responsibility, asserting that the perpetrators of the crime ‘were
mostly officers of his church, and had unquestionably drawn
encouragement from his earlier proceedings.’ *Hist. of the Christ. Ch.*
Vol. I. p. 401. W. Bright says, ‘Cyril was no party to this hideous
deed, but it was the work of men whose passions he had originally called
out. Had there been no onslaught on the synagogues, there would
doubtless have been no murder of Hypatia.’ *Hist. of the Church from*
313 *to* 451, pp. 274, 275. See also Schaff, *Hist. of the Christ. Ch.*
Vol. III. p. 943.
