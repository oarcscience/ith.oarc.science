<span id="ii.viii.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*After the Death of Valens
the Goths again attack Constantinople, and are repulsed by the Citizens,
aided by Some Saracen Auxiliaries.*

<span id="ii.viii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.ii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the Emperor Valens had thus
lost his life, in a manner which has never been satisfactorily
ascertained, <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679) the barbarians
again approached the very walls of Constantinople, and laid waste the
suburbs on every side of it. Whereat the people becoming indignant armed
themselves with whatever weapons they could severally lay hands on, and
sallied forth of their own accord against the enemy. The empress
Dominica caused the same pay to be distributed out of the imperial
treasury to such as volunteered to go out on this service, as was
usually allowed to soldiers. A few Saracens also assisted the citizens,
being confederates, who had been sent by Mavia their queen: the latter
we have already mentioned. <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680) In
this way the people having fought at this time, the barbarians retired
to a great distance from the city.
