<span id="iii.ix.viii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*Arrival of
Constantius at Rome. A Council held in Italy. Account of what happened
to Athanasius the Great through the Machinations of the Arians*.

<span id="iii.ix.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.viii-p2.1"></span>On</span> the death of the tyrants, <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298.md) Constantius anticipated the
restoration of peace and cessation of tumults, and quitted Sirmium in
order to return to ancient Rome, and to enjoy the honor of a triumph
after his victory over the tyrants. He likewise intended to bring the
Eastern and the Western bishops, if possible, to one mind concerning
doctrine, by convening a council in Italy. Julius died about this
period, after having governed the church of Rome during twenty-five
years; <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md) and Liberius succeeded
him. Those who were opposed to the doctrines of the Nicæan council
thought this a favorable opportunity to calumniate the bishops whom they
had deposed, and to procure their ejection from the church as abettors
of false doctrine, and as disturbers of the public peace; and to accuse
them of having sought, during the life of Constans, to excite a
misunderstanding between the emperors; and it was true, as we related
above, <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) that Constans menaced
his brother with war unless he would consent to receive the orthodox
bishops. Their efforts were principally directed against Athanasius,
towards whom they entertained so great an aversion that, even when he
was protected by Constans, and enjoyed the friendship of Constantius,
they could not conceal their enmity. Narcissus, bishop of Cilicia,
Theodore, bishop of Thrace, Eugenius, bishop of Nicæa, Patrophilus,
bishop of Scythopolis, Menophantes, bishop of Ephesus, and other
bishops, to the number of thirty, assembled themselves in Antioch, <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) and wrote a letter to all the
bishops of every region, in which they stated that Athanasius had
returned to his bishopric in violation of the rules of the Church, that
he had not justified himself in any council, and that he was only
supported by some of his own faction; and they exhorted them not to hold
communion with him, nor to write to him, but to enter into communion
with George, who had been ordained to succeed him. Athanasius only
contemned these proceedings; but he was about to undergo greater trials
than any he had yet experienced. Immediately on the death of Magnentius,
and as soon as Constantius found himself sole master of the Roman
Empire, he directed all his efforts to induce the bishops of the West to
admit that the Son is of like substance with the Father. In carrying out
this scheme, however, he did not, in the first place, resort to
compulsion, but endeavored by persuasion to obtain the concurrence of
the other bishops in the decrees of the Eastern bishops against
Athanasius; for he thought that if he could <span id="page_305">p.
305</span> <span id="iii.ix.viii-Page_305"></span>bring them to be of
one mind on this point, it would be easy for him to regulate aright the
affairs connected with religion.

error is due to his earlier confusion of Julius and Silvester.
