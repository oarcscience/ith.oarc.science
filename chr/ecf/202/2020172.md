<span id="ii.viii.viii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Gregory, finding Some
Dissatisfaction about his Appointment, abdicates the Episcopate of
Constantinople. The Emperor orders Demophilus the Arian Bishop either to
assent to the ‘Homoousion,’ or leave the City. He chooses the Latter.*

<span id="ii.viii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.viii-p2.1"></span>Now</span> at that time Gregory of
Nazianzus, after his translation to Constantinople, held his assemblies
within the city in a small oratory, adjoining to which the emperors
afterwards built a magnificent church, and named it *Anastasia*. <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) But Gregory, who far excelled in
eloquence and piety all those of the age in which he lived,
understanding that some murmured at his preferment because he was a
stranger, after expressing his joy at the emperor’s arrival, resigned
the bishopric of Constantinople. When the emperor found the church in
this state, he began to consider by what means he could make peace,
effect a union, and enlarge the churches. Immediately, therefore, he
intimated his desire to Demophilus, <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) who presided over the Arian party; and
enquired whether he was willing to assent to the Nicene Creed, and thus
reunite the people, and establish peace. Upon Demophilus’ declining to
accede to this proposal, the emperor said to him, ‘Since you reject
peace and harmony, I order you to quit the churches.’ When Demophilus
heard this, weighing with himself the difficulty of contending against
superior power, he convoked his followers in the church, and standing in
the midst of them, thus spoke: ‘Brethren, it is written in the
Gospel, <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) “If they persecute you
in one city, flee ye into another.” Since therefore the emperor needs
the churches, take notice that we will henceforth hold our assemblies
without the city.’ Having said this he departed; not however as rightly
apprehending the meaning of that expression in the Evangelist, for the
real <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span
id="ii.viii.viii-Page_121"></span>import of the sacred oracle is that
such as would avoid the course of this world must seek the heavenly
Jerusalem. <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) He therefore went
outside the city gates, and there in future held his assemblies. With
him also Lucius went out, who being ejected from Alexandria, as we have
before related, <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) had made his
escape to Constantinople, and there abode. Thus the Arians, after having
been in possession of the churches for forty years, were in consequence
of their opposition to the peace proposed by the emperor Theodosius,
driven out of the city, in Gratian’s fifth consulate, <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) and the first of Theodosius Angustus,
on the 26th of November. The adherents of the ‘homoousian’ faith in this
manner regained possession of the churches.

<span id="ii.viii.viii-p3"></span>It appears from several places in
Gregory’s writings (cf. *Somn. de Anastasia, Ad Popul. Anast.* and
*Carmen de Vita Sua,* 1709) that he himself had used the name of
Anastasia in speaking of the church, so that Socrates’ statement that it
was so called afterwards must be taken as inaccurate. It also appears
that Gregory gave the name *Anastasia* to the house which he used as a
church, and meant to signify by the name (Anastation = Resurrection) the
resurrection of the orthodox community of Constantinople. It is
possible, of course, that Socrates here means that the emperors later
adopted the name given by Gregory on the occasion of building a large
church in place of the original chapel. See also on Gregory’s stay at
Constantinople Sozom. VII. 5; Philostorgius, IX. 19; Theodoret, V. 8.
