id="ii.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI</span>.—*Of Hosius, Bishop of
Cordova.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxi-p2.1"></span>Since</span> we have observed that Hosius the
Spaniard was present \[at the council of Sirmium\] against his will, it
is necessary to give some brief account of him. A short time before he
had been sent into exile by the intrigues of the Arians: but at the
earnest solicitation of those convened at Sirmium, the emperor summoned
him thither, wishing that by persuasion, or by compulsion he should give
his sanction to their proceedings; for if this could be effected, they
considered it would give great authority to their sentiments. On this
ground, therefore, as I have said, he was most unwillingly obliged to be
present: and when he refused to concur with them, stripes and tortures
were inflicted on the old man. Wherefore he was constrained by <span
id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span id="ii.v.xxxi-Page_59"></span>force to
acquiesce in and subscribe to their exposition of the faith. Such was
the issue of affairs at that time transacted at Sirmium. But the emperor
Constantius after these things still continued to reside at that place,
awaiting there the result of the war against Magnentius.
