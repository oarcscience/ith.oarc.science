<span id="ii.v.xxi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*Defense of Eusebius
Pamphilus.*

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxi-p2.1"></span>But</span> since some have attempted to
stigmatize even Eusebius Pamphilus himself as having favored the Arian
views in his works, it may not be irrelevant here to make a few remarks
respecting him. In the first place then he was both present at the
council of Nicæa, which defined the doctrine of the *homoousion* and
gave his assent to what was there determined. And in the third book of
the Life of Constantine, he expressed himself in these words: <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) ‘The emperor incited all to unanimity,
until he had rendered them united in judgment on those points on which
they were previously at variance; so that they were quite agreed at
Nicæa in matters of faith.’ Since therefore Eusebius, in mentioning the
Nicene Synod, says that all differences were removed, and that all came
to unity of sentiment, what ground is there for assuming that he was
himself an Arian? The Arians are also certainly deceived in supposing
him to be a favorer of their tenets. But some one will perhaps say that
in his discourses he seems to have adopted the opinions of Arius,
because of his frequently saying through Christ, <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) to whom we should answer that
ecclesiastical writers often use this mode of expression and others of a
similar kind denoting the economy of our Saviour’s humanity: and that
before <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxi-Page_48"></span>all these the apostle <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) made use of such expressions, and
never has been accounted a teacher of false doctrine. Moreover, inasmuch
as Arius has dared to say that the Son is a creature, as one of the
others, observe what Eusebius says on this subject, in his first book
against Marcellus: <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md)

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p7"></span>‘He alone, and no other, has been declared
to be, and is the only-begotten Son of God; whence any one could justly
censure those who have presumed to affirm that he is a Creature made of
nothing, like the rest of the creatures; for how then would he be a Son?
and how could he be God’s only-begotten, were he assigned the same
nature as the other creatures…and were he one of the many created
things, seeing that he, like them, would in that case be partaker of a
creation from nothing? But the Sacred Scriptures do not thus instruct
us.’ He again adds a little afterwards: ‘Whoever then defines the Son as
made of things that are not, and as a creature produced from nothing
pre-existing, forgets that while he concedes the name of Son, he denies
him to be a Son in reality. For he that is made of nothing, cannot truly
be the Son of God, any more than the other things which have been made;
but the true Son of God, forasmuch as he is begotten of the Father, is
properly denominated the only-begotten and beloved of the Father. For
this reason also, he himself is God; for what can the offspring of God
be, but the perfect resemblance of him who begot him? A sovereign indeed
builds a city, but does not beget it; and is said to beget a son, not to
build one. An artificer, also, may be called the framer, but not the
father of his work; while he could by no means be styled the framer of
him whom he had begotten. So also the God of the Universe is the Father
of the Son; but might be fitly termed the Framer and Maker of the world.
And although it is once said in Scripture, <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) “The Lord created me the beginning of
his ways on account of his works,” yet it becomes us to consider the
import of this phrase, which I shall hereafter explain; and not, as
Marcellus has done, from a single passage to jeopardize the most
important doctrine of the church.’

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p9"></span>These and many other such expressions
Eusebius Pamphilus has given utterance to in the first book against
Marcellus; and in his third book, <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) declaring in what sense the term
*creature* is to be taken, he says:

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p11"></span>‘Accordingly, these things being thus
established, it follows that in the same sense as that which preceded,
the words, “The Lord created me the beginning of his ways, on account of
his works,” must have been spoken. For although he says that he was
created, it is not as if he should say that he had arrived at existence
from what was not, nor that he himself also was made of nothing like the
rest of the creatures, which some have erroneously supposed; but as
subsisting, living, pre-existing, and being before the constitution of
the whole world; and having been appointed to rule the universe by his
Lord and Father: the word created being here used instead of ordained or
constituted. Certainly the apostle <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) expressly called the rulers and
governors among men creature, when he said, “Submit yourselves to every
human creature for the Lord’s sake; whether to the king as supreme, or
to governors as those sent by him.” The prophet also <span
id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) when he says, “Prepare, Israel, to
invoke thy God. For behold he who confirms the thunder, creates the
Spirit, and announces his Christ unto men”: …has not used the word “he
who creates” in the sense of makes out of nothing. For God did not then
create the Spirit, when he declared his Christ to all men, since <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) “There is nothing new under the sun”;
but the Spirit existed, and had being previously: but he was sent at
what time the apostles were gathered together, when like thunder “There
came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind; and they were
filled with the Holy Spirit.” <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md)
And thus they declared unto all men the Christ of God, in accordance
with that prophecy which says, <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md)
“Behold he who confirms the thunder, creates the Spirit, and announces
his Christ unto men”: the word “creates” being used instead of “sends
down,” or appoints; and thunder in another figure implying the preaching
of the Gospel. Again he that says, “Create in me a clean heart, O
God,” <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) said not this as if he had
no heart; but prayed that his mind might be purified. Thus also it is
said, <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md) “That he might create the
two into one new man,” instead of unite. Consider also whether this
passage is not of the same kind, <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md)
“Clothe yourselves with the new man, which is created according to God”;
and this, <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) “If, therefore, any
one be in Christ, he is a new creature”; and whatever other expressions
of a similar nature any one may find who shall carefully search the
divinely inspired Scripture. Wherefore, one should not be surprised if
in this passage, “The Lord created me the beginning of his ways,” the
term “created” is used metaphorically, instead of “appointed” or
constituted.’

<span id="ii.v.xxi-p21"></span>Such words Eusebius uses in his work
against <span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span
id="ii.v.xxi-Page_49"></span>Marcellus; we have quoted them on account
of those who have slanderously attempted to traduce and criminate him.
Neither can they prove that Eusebius attributes a beginning of
subsistence to the Son of God, although they may find him often using
the expressions by accommodation; and especially so, because he was an
emulator and admirer of the works of Origen, in which those who are able
to comprehend the depth of Origen’s writings, will perceive it to be
everywhere stated that the Son was begotten of the Father. These remarks
have been made in passing, in order to refute those who have
misrepresented Eusebius.
