id="ii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*War arises between
Constantine and Licinius on Account of the Christians.*

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>By</span> this course he drew upon himself the
emperor Constantine’s heaviest displeasure; and they became enemies, the
pretended treaty of friendship between them having been violated. Not
long afterwards they took up arms against each other as declared
enemies. And after several engagements both by sea and land, Licinius
was at last utterly defeated near Chrysopolis in Bithynia, a port of the
Chalcedonians, and surrendered himself to Constantine. Accordingly he
having taken him alive, treated him with the utmost humanity, and would
by no means put him to death, but ordered him to <span id="page_3">p.

tranquillity at Thessalonica. He having, however, remained quiet a short
time, managed afterwards to collect some barbarian mercenaries and made
an effort to repair his late disaster by a fresh appeal to arms. The
emperor being made acquainted with his proceedings, directed that he
should be slain, which was carried into effect. Constantine thus became
possessed of the sole dominion, and was accordingly proclaimed sovereign
Autocrat, <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) and again sought to
promote the welfare of Christians. This he did in a variety of ways, and
Christianity enjoyed unbroken peace by reason of his efforts. But an
internal dissension soon succeeded this state of repose, the nature and
origin of which I shall now endeavor to describe.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p3"></span>After a victory the soldiers greeted their
prince with acclamations of ‘Emperor!’ ‘Augustus!’ So also did the
citizens on his triumphal entry into the city. So it appears Constantine
was formally greeted on assuming the sole control of affairs.
