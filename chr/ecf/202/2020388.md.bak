<span id="iii.ix.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Death of Macedonius,
Bishop of Constantinople. What Eudoxius said in his Teaching. Eudoxius
and Acacius strenuously sought the Abolition of the Formularies of Faith
set forth at Nicæa and at Ariminum; Troubles which thence arose in the
Churches*.

<span id="iii.ix.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Macedonius</span>, <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) on his expulsion from the church of
Constantinople, retired to one of the suburbs of the city, where he
died. Eudoxius took possession of his church in the tenth year of the
consulate of Constantius, and the third of Julian, surnamed Cæsar. It is
related that, at the dedication of the great church called “Sophia,”
when he rose to teach the people, he commenced his discourse with the
following proposition: “The Father is impious, the Son is pious”; and
that, as these words excited a great commotion among the people, he
added, “Be calm; the Father is impious, because he worships no one; the
Son is pious, because he worships the Father.” On this explanation, he
threw his audience into laughter. Eudoxius and Acacius jointly exerted
themselves to the utmost in endeavoring to cause the edicts of the
Nicene Council to fall into oblivion. They sent the formulary read at
Ariminum with various explanatory additions of their own, to every
province of the empire, and procured from the emperor an edict for the
banishment of all who should refuse to subscribe to it. But this
undertaking, which appeared to them so easy of execution, was the
beginning of the greatest calamities, for it excited commotions
throughout the empire, and entailed upon the Church in every region a
persecution more grievous than those which it had suffered under the
pagan emperors. <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) For if this
persecution did not occasion such tortures to the body as the preceding
ones, it appeared more grievous to all who reflected aright, on account
of its disgraceful nature; for both the persecutors and the persecuted
belonged to the Church; and the one was all the more disgraceful in that
men of the same religion treated their fellows with a degree of cruelty
which the ecclesiastical laws prohibit to be manifested towards enemies
and strangers.
