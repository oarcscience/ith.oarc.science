<span id="iii.xii.i-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*When the Romans are
pressed by the Barbarians, Mavia sends Assistance, and some of the
Populace effect a Victory. Gratian commands each to believe as he
wishes*.

<span id="iii.xii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.i-p3.1"></span>Such</span> was the fate of Valens. The
barbarians, <span id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) flushed with
victory, overran Thrace, and advanced to the gates of Constantinople. In
this emergency, a few of the confederate Saracens sent by Mavia,
together with many of the populace, were of great service. It is
reported that Dominica, wife of Valens, furnished money out of the
public treasury, and some of the people, after hastily arming
themselves, attacked the barbarians, and drove them from the city.

<span id="iii.xii.i-p5"></span>Gratian, who at this period reigned
conjointly with his brother over the whole Roman Empire, disapproved of
the late persecution that had been carried on to check the diversity in
religious creeds, and recalled all those who had been banished on
account of their religion. He also enacted a law by which it was decreed
that every individual should be freely permitted the exercise of his own
religion, and should be allowed to hold assemblies, with the exception
of the Manichæans and the followers of Photinus and Eunomius. <span
