<span id="ii.x.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Of Theodosius and
Agapetus Bishops of Synada.*

<span id="ii.x.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.iii-p2.1"></span>A certain</span> Theodosius was bishop of
Synada in Phrygia Pacata; he violently persecuted the heretics in that
province—and there was a great number of them—and especially those of
the Macedonian sect; he drove them out not only from the city, but also
out of the country. This course he pursued not from any precedent in the
orthodox church, nor from the desire of propagating the true faith; but
being enslaved by the love of filthy lucre, he was impelled by the
avaricious motive of amassing money, by extorting it from the heretics.
To this end he made all sorts of attempts upon the Macedonians, putting
arms into the hands of his clergy; and employing innumerable stratagems
against them; nor did he refrain from de<span id="page_155">p.
155</span> <span id="ii.x.iii-Page_155"></span>livering them up to the
secular tribunals. <span id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908.md) But he
especially annoyed their bishop whose name was Agapetus: and finding the
governors of the province were not invested with sufficient authority to
punish heretics according to his wish, he went to Constantinople and
petitioned for edicts of a more stringent nature from the Prætorian
prefect. While Theodosius was absent on this business, Agapetus who, as
I have said, presided over the Macedonian sect, came to a wise and
prudent conclusion. Communicating with his clergy, he called all the
people under his guidance together, and persuaded them to embrace the
‘homoousian’ faith. On their acquiescing in this proposition, he
proceeded immediately to the church attended not merely by his own
adherents, but by the whole body of the people. There having offered
prayer, he took possession of the episcopal chair in which Theodosius
was accustomed to seat himself; and preaching thenceforth the doctrine
of consubstantiality, he reunited the people, and made himself master of
the churches in the diocese of Synada. Soon after these transactions,
Theodosius returned to Synada, bringing with him extended powers from
the prefect, and knowing nothing of what had taken place, he proceeded
to the church just as he was. Being forthwith unanimously expelled, he
again betook himself to Constantinople; upon his arrival at that place
he complained to Atticus, the bishop, of the treatment he had met with,
and the manner in which he had been deprived of his bishopric. Atticus
perceiving that this movement had resulted advantageously to the church,
consoled Theodosius as well as he could; recommending him to embrace
with a contented mind a retired life, and thus sacrifice his own private
interests to the public good. He then wrote to Agapetus authorizing him
to retain the episcopate, and bidding him be under no apprehension of
being molested in consequence of Theodosius’ grievance.
