<span id="iii.viii.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*High Priests of Rome
and of Constantinople; Restoration of Paul after Eusebius; the Slaughter
of Hermogenes, a General of the Army; Constantius came from Antioch and
removed Paul, and was wrathfully disposed toward the City; he allowed
Macedonius to be in Doubt, and returned to Antioch*.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> were the schemes of those who
upheld various heresies in opposition to truth successfully carried into
execution; and thus did they depose those bishops who strenuously
maintained throughout the East the supremacy of the doctrines of the
Nicæan Council. These heretics had taken possession of the most
important sees, such as Alexandria in Egypt, Antioch in Syria, and the
imperial city of the Hellespont, and they held all the persuaded bishops
in subjection. The ruler of the Church at Rome and all the priests of
the West regarded these deeds as a personal insult; for they had
accorded from the beginning with all the decisions in the vote made by
those convened at Nice, nor did they now cease from that way of
thinking. On the arrival of Athanasius, they received him <span
id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span
id="iii.viii.vii-Page_287"></span>kindly, and espoused his cause among
themselves. Irritated at this interference, Eusebius wrote to Julius,
exhorting him to constitute himself a judge of the decrees that had been
enacted against Athanasius by the council of Tyre. <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md) But before he had been able to
ascertain the sentiments of Julius, and, indeed, not long after the
council of Antioch, Eusebius died. Immediately upon this event, those
citizens of Constantinople who maintained the doctrines of the Nicæan
Council, conducted Paul to the church. At the same time those of the
opposing multitude seized this occasion and came together in another
church, among whom were the adherents of Theognis, bishop of Nicæa, of
Theodore, bishop of Heraclea, and others of the same party who chanced
to be present, and they ordained Macedonius bishop of Constantinople.
This excited frequent seditions in the city which assumed all the
appearance of a war, for the people fell upon one another, and many
perished. The city was filled with tumult, so that the emperor, who was
then at Antioch, on hearing of what had occurred, was moved to wrath,
and issued a decree for the expulsion of Paul. Hermogenes, general of
the cavalry, endeavored to put this edict of the emperor’s into
execution; for having been sent to Thrace, he had, on the journey, to
pass by Constantinople, and he thought, by means of his army, to eject
Paul from the church by force. But the people, instead of yielding, met
him with open resistance, and while the soldiers, in order to carry out
the orders they had received, attempted still greater violence, the
insurgents entered the house of Hermogenes, set fire to it, killed him,
and attaching a cord to his body, dragged it through the city. <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) The emperor had no sooner received
this intelligence than he took horse for Constantinople, in order to
punish the people. But he spared them when he saw them coming to meet
him with tears and supplications. He deprived the city of about half of
the corn which his father, Constantine, had granted them annually out of
the public treasury from the tributes of Egypt, probably from the idea
that luxury and excess made the populace idle and disposed to sedition.
He turned his anger against Paul and commanded his expulsion from the
city. He manifested great displeasure against Macedonius also, because
he was the occasion of the murder of the general and of other
individuals and also, because he had been ordained without first
obtaining his sanction. He, however, returned to Antioch, without having
either confirmed or dissolved his ordination. Meanwhile the zealots of
the Arian tenets deposed Gregory, because he was indifferent in the
support of their doctrines, and had moreover incurred the ill-will of
the Alexandrians on account of the calamities which had befallen the
city at his entrance, especially the conflagration of the church. They
elected George, a native of Cappadocia, in his stead; <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md) this new bishop was admired on
account of his activity and his zeal in support of the Arian dogma.
