<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Manes, the Founder of
the Manichæan Heresy, and on his Origin.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p2.1"></span>But</span> amidst the good wheat, tares are
accustomed to spring up; for envy loves to plot insidiously against the
good. Hence it was that a little while before the time of Constantine, a
species of heathenish Christianity made its appearance together with
that which was real; just as false prophets sprang up among the true,
and false apostles among the true apostles. For at that time a dogma of
Empedocles, the heathen philosopher, by means of Manichæus, assumed the
form of Christian doctrine. Eusebius Pamphilus has indeed mentioned this
person in the seventh book of his Ecclesiastical History, <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) but has not entered into minute
details concerning him. Wherefore, I deem it incumbent on me to supply
some particulars which he has left unnoticed: thus it will be known who
this Manichæus was, whence he came, and what was the nature of his
presumptuous daring.

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p4"></span>A Saracen named Scythian married a
captive from the Upper Thebes. On her account he dwelt in Egypt, and
having versed himself in the learning of the Egyptians, he subtly
introduced the theory of Empedocles and Pythagoras among the doctrines
of the Christian faith. Asserting that there were two natures, a good
and an evil one, he termed, as Empedocles had done, the latter Discord,
and the former Friendship. Of this Scythian, Buddas, who had been
previously called Terebinthus, became a disciple; and he having
proceeded to Babylon, which the Persians inhabit, made many extravagant
statements respecting himself, declaring that he was born of a virgin,
and brought up in the mountains. The same man afterwards composed four
books, one he entitled *The Mysteries,* another *The Gospel,* a third
*The Treasure,* and the fourth *Heads* \[*Summaries*\]; but pretending
to perform some mystic rites, he was hurled down a precipice by a
spirit, <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) and so perished. A
certain woman at whose house he had lodged buried him, and taking
possession of his property, bought a boy about seven years old whose
name was Cubricus: this lad she enfranchised, and having given him a
liberal education, she soon after died, leaving him all that belonged to
Terebinthus, including the books he had written on the principles
inculcated by Scythian. Cubricus, the freedman, taking these things with
him and having withdrawn into the regions of Persia, changed his name,
calling himself Manes; and disseminated the books of Buddas or
Terebinthus among his deluded followers as his own. Now the contents of
these treatises apparently agree with Christianity in expression, but
are pagan in sentiment: for Manichæus being an atheist, incited his
disciples to acknowledge a plurality of gods, and taught them to worship
the sun. He also introduced the doctrine of Fate, denying human
free-will; and affirmed a transmutation <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) of bodies, clearly following the
opinions of Empedocles, Pythagoras, and the Egyptians. He <span
id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="ii.iv.xxii-Page_26"></span>denied
that Christ existed in the flesh, asserting that he was an apparition;
and rejected moreover the law and the prophets, calling himself the
‘Comforter,’—all of which dogmas are totally at variance with the
orthodox faith of the church. In his epistles he even dared to call
himself an apostle; but for a pretension so unfounded he brought upon
himself merited retribution in the following manner. The son of the
Persian monarch having been attacked with disease, his father became
anxious for his recovery, and left no means untried in order to effect
it; and as he had heard of the wonder-working of Manichæus, and thinking
that these miracles were real, he sent for him as an apostle, trusting
that through him his son might be restored. He accordingly presented
himself at court, and with his assumed manner undertook the treatment of
the young prince. But the king seeing that the child died in his hands
shut up the deceiver in prison, with the intention of putting him to
death. However, he contrived to escape, and fled into Mesopotamia; but
the king of Persia having discovered that he was dwelling there, caused
him to be brought thence by force, and after having flayed him alive, he
stuffed his skin with chaff, and suspended it in front of the gate of
the city. These things we state not having manufactured them ourselves,
but collected from a book entitled *The disputation of Archelaus bishop
of Caschara* (one of the cities of Mesopotamia). <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) For Archelaus himself states that he
disputed with Manichæus face to face, and mentions the circumstances
connected with his life to which we have now alluded. Envy thus
delights, as we before remarked, to be insidiously at work in the midst
of a prosperous condition of affairs. But for what reason the goodness
of God permits this to be done, whether he wishes thereby to bring into
activity the excellence of the principles of the church, and to utterly
break down the self-importance which is wont to unite itself with faith;
or for what other cause, is, at the same time, a difficult question, and
not relevant to the present discussion. For our object is neither to
examine the soundness of doctrinal views, nor to analyze the mysterious
reasons for the providences and judgments of God; but to detail as
faithfully as possible the history of transactions which have taken
place in the churches. The way in which the superstition of the
Manichæans sprang up a little before the time of Constantine has been
thus described; now let us return to the times and events which are the
proper subjects of this history.
