id="ii.ix.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Death of Arsacius, and
Ordination of Atticus.*

<span id="ii.ix.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xxi-p2.1"></span>But</span> Arsacius did not long survive his
accession to the bishopric; for he died on the 11th of November under
the following consulate, which was Stilicho’s second, and the first of
Anthemius. <span id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889.md) In consequence of the
fact that the bishopric became desirable and many aspired to the vacant
see, much time elapsed before the election of a successor: but at length
in the following consulate, which was the sixth of Arcadius, and the
first of Probus, <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md) a devout man
named Atticus was promoted to the episcopate. He was a native of
Sebastia in Armenia, and had followed an ascetic life from an early age:
moreover in addition to a moderate share of learning, he possessed a
large amount of natural prudence. But I shall speak of him more
particularly a little later. <span id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md)
