<span id="iii.xi.xxxv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*The Wooden Tripod and
the Succession of the Emperor, through a Knowledge of its Letters.
Destruction of the Philosophers; Astronomy*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxv-p2.1"></span>Such</span> is the information which I have
been enabled to collect concerning the ecclesiastical philosophers of
that time. As to the pagans, they were nearly all exterminated about the
period to which we have been referring. <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) Some among them, who were reputed
to excel in philosophy, and who viewed with extreme displeasure the
progress of the Christian religion, were devising who would be the
successor of Valens on the throne of the Roman Empire, and resorted to
every variety of mantic art for the purpose of attaining this insight
into futurity. After various incantations, they constructed a tripod of
laurel wood, and they wound up with the invocations and words to which
they are accustomed; so that the name of the emperor might be shown by
the collection of letters which were indicated, letter by letter,
through the machinery of the tripod and the prophecy. They were gaping
with open mouth for Theodore, a man who held a distinguished military
appointment in the palace. He was a pagan and a learned man. The
disposition of the letters, coming as far as the delta of his name,
deceived the philosophers. They hence expected that Theodore would very
soon be the emperor. When their undertaking was informed upon, Valens
was as unbearably incensed, as if a conspiracy had been formed against
his safety. <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span
id="iii.xi.xxxv-Page_372"></span>Therefore all were arrested; Theodore
and the constructors of the tripod were commanded to be put to death,
some with fire, others with the sword. Likewise for the same reason the
most brilliant philosophers of the empire were slain; since the wrath of
the emperor was unchecked, the death penalty advanced even to those who
were not philosophers, but who wore garments similar to theirs; hence
those who applied themselves to other pursuits would not clothe
themselves with the crocotium or tribonium, on account of the suspicion
and fear of danger, so that they might not seem to be pursuing magic and
sorcery. I do not in the least think that the emperor will be more
blamed by right-thinking people for such wrath and cruelty than the
philosophers, for their rashness and their unphilosophical undertaking.
The emperor, absurdly supposing that he could put his successor to
death, spared neither those who had prophesied nor the subject of their
prophecy, as they say he did not spare those who bore the same name of
Theodore,—and some were men of distinction,—whether they were precisely
the same or similar in beginning with <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxv-p3.1"></span>θ</span> and ending with <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxxv-p3.2"></span>δ</span>. The
philosophers, on the other hand, acted as if the deposition and
restoration of emperors had depended solely on them; for if the imperial
succession was to be considered dependent on the arrangement of the
stars, what was requisite but to await the accession of the future
emperor, whoever he might be? or if the succession was regarded as
dependent on the will of God, what right had man to meddle? For it is
not the function of human foreknowledge or zeal to understand God’s
thought; nor if it were right, would it be well for men, even if they be
the wisest of all, to think that they can plan better than God. If it
were merely from rash curiosity to discern the things of futurity that
they showed such lack of judgment as to be ready to be caught in danger,
and to despise the laws anciently established among the Romans, and at a
time when it was not dangerous to conduct pagan worship and to
sacrifice; in this they thought differently from Socrates; for when
unjustly condemned to drink poison, he refused to save himself by
violating the laws in which he had been born and educated, nor would he
escape from prison, although it was in his power to do so.
