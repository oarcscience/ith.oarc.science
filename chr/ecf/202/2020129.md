<span id="ii.vii.iv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*The Macedonians hold a
Synod at Lampsacus, during a Period of Both Secular and Ecclesiastical
Agitation; and after confirming the Antiochian Creed, and anathematizing
that promulgated at Ariminum, they again ratify the Deposition of
Acacius and Eudoxius.*

<span id="ii.vii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>While</span> these events were taking place
there could be no peace either in the church or in the state. Now those
who had been empowered by the emperor to hold a council assembled at
Lampsacus in the consulate just mentioned: this was seven years after
the council of Seleucia. There, after confirming the Antiochian Creed,
to which they had subscribed at Seleucia, <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571) they anathematized that which had been
set forth at Ariminum <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572) by their
former associates in opinion. They moreover again condemned the party of
Acacius and Eudoxius, and declared their deposition to have been
just. <span id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573) The civil war which was
then impending prevented Eudoxius bishop of Constantinople from either
gainsaying or revenging these determinations. Wherefore Eleusius bishop
of Cyzicus and his adherents became for a little while the stronger
party; inasmuch as they supported the views of Macedonius, which
although before but obscurely known, acquired great publicity through
the Synod at Lampsacus. This Synod, I think, was the cause of the
increase of the Macedonians in the Hellespont; for Lampsacus is situated
in one of the narrow bays of the Hellespont. Such was the issue of this
council.
