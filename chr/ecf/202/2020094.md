id="ii.v.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV</span>.—*Of Meletius* <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) *Bishop of Antioch.*

<span id="ii.v.xliv-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xliv-p3.1"></span>It</span> becomes us now to speak of
Meletius, who, as we have recently observed, was created bishop of
Sebastia in Armenia, after the deposition of Eustathius; from Sebastia
he was transferred to Berœa, a city of Syria. Being present at the Synod
of Seleucia, he subscribed the creed set forth there by Acacius, and
immediately returned thence to Berœa. When the convention of the Synod
at Constantinople was held, the people of Antioch finding that Eudoxius,
captivated by the magnificence of the see of Constantinople, had
contemned their church, they sent for Meletius, and invested him with
the bishopric of the church at Antioch. Now he at first avoided all
doctrinal questions, confining his discourses to moral subjects; but
subsequently he expounded to his auditors the Nicene creed, and asserted
the doctrine of the *homoousion.* The emperor being informed of this,
ordered that he should be sent into exile; and caused Euzoïus, who had
before been deposed together with Arius, to be installed bishop of
Antioch in his stead. Such, however, as were attached to Meletius,
separated themselves from the Arian congregation, and held their
assemblies apart: nevertheless, those who originally embraced the
*homoousian* opinion would not communicate with them, because Meletius
had been ordained by the Arians, and his adherents had been baptized by
them. Thus was the Antiochian church divided, even in regard to those
whose views on matters of faith exactly corresponded. Meanwhile the
emperor getting intelligence that the Persians were preparing to
undertake another war against the Romans, repaired in great haste to
Antioch.
