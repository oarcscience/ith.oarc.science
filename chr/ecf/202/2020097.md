id="ii.v.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII</span>.—*Successes of Julian;
Death of the Emperor Constantius.*

<span id="ii.v.xlvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xlvii-p2.1"></span>While</span> the Emperor Constantius
continued his residence at Antioch, Julian Cæsar engaged with an immense
army of barbarians in the Gauls, and obtaining the victory over them, he
became extremely popular among the soldiery and was proclaimed emperor
by them. When this was made known, the Emperor Constantius was affected
most painfully; he was therefore baptized by Euzoïus, and immediately
prepared to undertake an expedition against Julian. On arriving at the
frontiers of Cappadocia and Cilicia, his excessive agitation of mind
produced apoplexy, which terminated his life at Mopsucrene, in the
consulate of Taurus and Florentius, <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) on the 3d of November. This was in the
first year of the 285th Olympiad. Constantius had lived forty-five
years, having reigned thirty-eight years; thirteen of which he was his
father’s colleague in the empire, and after his father’s death for
twenty-five years \[sole emperor\], the history of which latter period
is contained in this book.
