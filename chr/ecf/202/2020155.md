<span id="ii.vii.xxx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*Dissension about a
Successor to Auxentius, Bishop of Milan. Ambrose, Governor of the
Province, going to appease the Tumult, is by General Consent and with
the Approval of the Emperor Valentinian elected to the Bishopric of that
Church.*

<span id="ii.vii.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxx-p2.1"></span>About</span> the same time it happened
that <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) another event took place at
Milan well worthy of being recorded. On the death of Auxentius, who had
been ordained bishop of that church by the Arians, the people again were
disturbed respecting the election of a successor; for as some proposed
one person, and others favored another, the city was full of contention
and uproar. In this state of things the governor of the province,
Ambrose by name, <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) who was also of
consular dignity, dreading some catastrophe from the popular excitement,
ran into the church in order to quell the disturbance. As he arrived
there and the people became quiet, he repressed the irrational fury of
the multitude by a long and appropriate address, by urging such motives
as they felt to be right, and all present suddenly came to an unanimous
agreement, crying out ‘that Ambrose was worthy of the bishopric,’ and
demanding his ordination: ‘for by that means only,’ it was alleged,
‘would the peace of the <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span
id="ii.vii.xxx-Page_114"></span>church be secured, and all be reunited
in the same faith and judgment.’ And inasmuch as such unanimity among
the people appeared to the bishops then present to proceed from some
Divine appointment, immediately they laid hands on Ambrose; and having
baptized him—for he was then but a catechumen—they were about to invest
him with the episcopal office. But although Ambrose willingly received
baptism, he with great earnestness refused to be ordained: upon which
the bishops referred the matter to the Emperor Valentinian. This prince
regarding the universal consent of the people as the work of God, sent
word to the bishops to do the will of God by ordaining him; declaring
that ‘his choice was by the voice of God rather than by the votes of
men.’ Ambrose was therefore ordained; and thus the inhabitants of Milan
who were divided among themselves, were once more restored to unity.

<span id="ii.vii.xxx-p3"></span>Synchronization of the events attending
the accession of Damasus and Ambrose, the former in Rome, the latter at
Milan, is dependent on Rufinus. Cf. *H. E.* II. 11. The events of this
chapter more properly fall within the time reached by Socrates, i.e. 374
<span class="c13"><span id="ii.vii.xxx-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> (see
chap. 29, note 1). Hence rightly seven years later than the events of
the preceding chapter.

ecclesiastical and literary pursuits in the manner described in this
chapter. Cf. Sozom. VI. 24; Theodoret, *H. E.* IV. 6; Rufinus, *H. E.*
II. 11.
