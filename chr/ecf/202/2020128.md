<span id="ii.vii.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*While Valens persecutes
the Orthodox Christians in the East, a Usurper arises at Constantinople
named Procopius: and at the Same Time an Earthquake and Inundation take
Place and injure Several Cities.*

<span id="ii.vii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.iii-p2.1"></span>While</span> Valens was thus occupied in
Syria, there arose a usurper at Constantinople named Procopius; who
having collected a large body of troops in a very short time, meditated
an expedition against the emperor. This intelligence created extreme
solicitude in the emperor’s mind and checked for a while the persecution
he had commenced against all who dared to differ from him in opinion.
And while the commotions of a civil war were painfully anticipated, an
earthquake occurred which did much damage to many cities. The sea also
changed its accustomed boundaries, and overflowed to such an extent in
some places, that vessels might sail where roads had previously existed;
and it retired so much from other places, that the ground became dry.
These events happened in the first consulate of the two emperors. <span

[Next: The Macedonians hold a Synod at Lampsacus, during a Period of
Both Secular and Ecclesiastical Agitation; and after confirming the
Antiochian Creed, and anathematizing that promulgated at Ariminum, they
again ratify the Deposition of Acacius and Eudoxius.](2020129)
