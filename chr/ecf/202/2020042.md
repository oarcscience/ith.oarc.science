<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII</span>.—*The Members of the
Synod proceed from Tyre to Jerusalem, and having celebrated the
Dedication of the ‘New Jerusalem,’ receive Arius and his Followers into
Communion.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Letters</span> in the meantime were
brought from the emperor directing those who composed the Synod to
hasten to the *New Jerusalem:* <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248)
having therefore immediately left Tyre, they set forward with all
despatch to Jerusalem, where, after celebrating a festival in connection
with the consecration of the place, they readmitted Arius <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249) and his adherents into communion, in
obedience, as they said, to the wishes of the emperor, who had signified
in his communication to them, that he was fully satisfied respecting the
faith of Arius and Euzoïus. They moreover wrote to the church at
Alexandria, <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250) stating that all
envy being now banished, the affairs of the church were established in
peace: and that since Arius had by his recantation acknowledged the
truth, it was but just that, being thenceforth a member of the church,
he should also be henceforth received by them, alluding to the
banishment of Athanasius \[in their statement that ‘all envy was now
banished’\]. At the same time they sent information of what had been
done to the emperor, in terms nearly to the same effect. But whilst the
bishops were engaged in these transactions, other letters came
unexpectedly from the emperor, intimating that Athanasius had fled to
him for protection; and that it was necessary for them on his account to
come to Constantinople. This unanticipated communication from the
emperor was as follows.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxiii-p4"></span>Arius, the originator of the Arian
heresy, died before the council at Jerusalem; hence Valesius infers that
this Arius must be another man of the same name mentioned in the
encyclical of Alexander of Alexandria as a partisan of the arch-heretic.
Cf. ch. 6.
