id="ii.x.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII</span>.—*The Empress Eudocia
goes to Jerusalem; sent there by the Emperor Theodosius.*

<span id="ii.x.xlvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xlvii-p2.1"></span>Moreover</span> the Emperor Theodosius
offered up thanksgivings to God for the blessings which had been
conferred upon him; at the same time reverencing Christ with the most
special honors. He also sent his wife Eudocia to Jerusalem, <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) she having bound herself by a vow
to go thither, should she live to see the marriage of her daughter. The
empress therefore, on her visit to the sacred city, adorned its churches
with the most costly gifts; and both then, and after her return,
decorated all the churches in the other cities of the East with a
variety of ornaments.

<span id="ii.x.xlvii-p3"></span>On this visit of the empress to
Jerusalem, see Evagrius, *H. E.* I. 20–23. During this visit for some
reason or other—variously stated by the authors of the period—an
alienation occurred between the emperor and Eudocia. See above, chap.
21, note 2.
