<span id="ii.viii.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*The Usurper Eugenius
compasses the Death of Valentinian the Younger. Theodosius obtains a
Victory over him.*

<span id="ii.viii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>There</span> was in the Western regions a
grammarian named Eugenius, <span id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) who
after having for some time taught the Latin language, left his school,
and was appointed to service at the palace, being constituted chief
secretary to the emperor. Possessing a considerable degree of eloquence,
and being on that account treated with greater distinction than others,
he was unable to bear his good fortune with moderation. For associating
with himself Arbogastes, a native of Galatia Minor, who then had the
command of a division of the army, a man harsh in manner and very
bloodthirsty, he determined to usurp the sovereignty. These two
therefore agreed to murder the Emperor Valentinian, having corrupted the
eunuchs of the imperial bed-chamber. These, on receiving tempting
promises of promotion, strangled the emperor in his sleep. Eugenius
immediately assuming the supreme authority in the Western parts of the
empire, conducted himself in such a manner as might be expected from a
usurper. When the Emperor Theodosius was made acquainted with these
things, he was exceedingly distressed, because his defeat of Maximus had
only prepared the way for fresh troubles. He accordingly assembled his
military forces, and having proclaimed his son Honorius Augustus, on the
10th of January, in his own third consulate <span
id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) which he bore with Abundantius, he
again set out in great haste toward the Western parts, leaving both his
sons invested with imperial authority at Constantinople. As he marched
against Eugenius a very great number of the barbarians beyond the Danube
volunteered their services, and followed him in this expedition. After a
rapid march he arrived in the Gauls with a numerous army, where Eugenius
awaited him, also at the head of an immense body of troops. Accordingly
an engagement took place near the river Frigidus, which is \[about
thirty-six miles\] distant \[from Aquileia\]. In that part of the battle
where the Romans fought against their own countrymen, the conflict was
doubtful: but where the barbarian auxiliaries of the Emperor Theodosius
were engaged, the forces of Eugenius had greatly the advantage. When the
emperor saw the barbarians perishing, he cast himself in great agony
upon the ground, and invoked the help of God in this emergency: nor was
his request unheeded; for Bacurius <span
id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md) his principal officer, inspired with
sudden and extraordinary ardor, rushed with his vanguard to the part
where the barbarians were hardest pressed, broke through the ranks of
the enemy, and put to flight those who a little before were themselves
engaged in pursuit. Another marvelous circumstance <span
id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span id="ii.viii.xxvi-Page_136"></span>also
occurred. A violent wind suddenly arose, which retorted upon themselves
the darts cast by the soldiers of Eugenius, and at the same time drove
those hurled by the imperial forces with increased impetus against their
adversaries. <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md) So prevalent was
the emperor’s prayer. The success of the struggle being in this way
turned, the usurper threw himself at the emperor’s feet, and begged that
his life might be spared: but as he lay a prostrate suppliant at the
feet \[of the emperor\] he was beheaded by the soldiers, on the 6th of
September, in the third consulate of Arcadius, and the second of
Honorius. <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) Arbogastes, who had
been the chief cause of so much mischief, having continued his flight
for two days after the battle, and seeing no chance of escape,
despatched himself with his own sword.

Eugenius is also given by Zosimus (IV. 53–58), who adds that Arbogastes
was a Frank; and also by Philostorgius (XI. 1), who says that Eugenius
was a pagan.
