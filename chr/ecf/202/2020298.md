<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Acesius, Bishop of
the Novatians, is summoned by the Emperor to be present at the First
Council*.

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is related, that the emperor,
under the impulse of an ardent desire to see harmony re-established
among Christians, summoned Acesius, bishop of the church of the
Novatians, <span id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128) to the council,
placed before him the definition of the faith and of the feast, which
had already been confirmed by the signatures of the bishops, and asked
whether he could agree thereto. Acesius answered that their exposition
defined no new doctrine, and that he accorded in opinion with the Synod,
and that he had from the beginning held these sentiments with respect
both to the faith and to the feast. “Why, then,” said the emperor, “do
you keep aloof from communion with others, if you are of one mind with
them?” He replied that the dissension first broke out under Decius,
between Novatius and Cornelius, <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129) and that he considered such persons
unworthy of communion who, after baptism, had fallen into those sins
which the Scriptures declare to be unto death; <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130) for that the remission of those
sins, he thought, depended on the authority of God only, and not on the
priests. The emperor replied, by saying, “O Acesius, take a ladder and
ascend alone to heaven.” By this speech I do not imagine the emperor
intended to praise Acesius, but rather to blame him, because, being but
a man, he fancied himself exempt from sin. <span

his information is passed over, as well as his criticism of prejudiced
historians. The comment substituted by Soz. is, nevertheless, a
partially correct interpretation.
