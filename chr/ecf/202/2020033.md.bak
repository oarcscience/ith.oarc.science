<span id="ii.iv.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Of the Synod held at
Antioch, which deposed Eustathius, Bishop of Antioch, on whose account a
Sedition broke out and almost ruined the City.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Having</span> therefore convened a Synod at
Antioch, they deposed Eustathius, as a supporter of the Sabellian
heresy, rather than of the tenets which the council at Nicæa had
formulated. As some affirm \[this measure was taken\] for other and
unsatisfactory reasons, though none other have been openly assigned:
this is a matter of common occurrence; the bishops are accustomed to do
this in all cases, accusing and pronouncing impious those whom they
depose, but not explaining their warrant for so doing. George, bishop of
Laodicea in Syria, one of the number of those who abominated the term
*homoousios,* assures us in his *Encomium of Eusebius Emisenus,* that
they deposed Eustathius as favoring Sabellianism, on the impeachment of
Cyrus, bishop of Berœa. Of Eusebius Emisenus we shall speak elsewhere in
due order. <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) George has written of
Eustathius \[somewhat inconsistently\]; for after asserting that he was
accused by Cyrus of maintaining the heresy of Sabellius, he tells us
again that Cyrus himself was convicted of the same error, and degraded
for it. Now how was it possible that Cyrus should accuse Eustathius as a
Sabellian, when he inclined to Sabellianism himself? It appears likely
therefore that Eustathius must have been condemned on other grounds. At
that time, however, there arose a dangerous sedition at Antioch on
account of his deposition: for when they proceeded to the election of a
successor, so fierce a dissension was kindled, as to threaten the whole
city with destruction. The populace was divided into two factions, one
of which vehemently contended for the translation of Eusebius Pamphilus
from Cæsarea in Palestine to Antioch; the other equally insisted on the
reinstatement of Eustathius. And the populace of the city were infected
with the spirit of partisanship in this quarrel among the Christians, a
military force was arrayed on both sides with hostile intent, so that a
bloody collision would have taken place, had not God and the dread of
the emperor repressed the violence of the multitude. For the emperor
through letters, and Eusebius by refusing to accept the bishopric,
served to allay the ferment: on which account that prelate was
exceedingly admired by the emperor, who wrote to him commending his
prudent determination, and congratulating him as one who was considered
worthy of being bishop not of one city merely, but of almost the whole
world. Consequently it is said that the episcopal chair of the church at
Antioch was vacant for eight consecutive years after this period; <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) but at length by the exertions of
those who aimed at the subversion of the Nicene creed, Euphronius was
duly installed. This is the amount of my information respecting the
Synod held at Antioch on account of Eustathius. Immediately after these
events Eusebius, who had long before left Berytus, and was at that time
presiding over the church at Nicomedia, strenuously exerted himself in
connection to those of his party, to bring back Arius to Alexandria. But
how they managed to effect this, and by what means the emperor was
pre<span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xxiv-Page_28"></span>vailed on to admit both Arius and with
him Euzoïus into his presence must now be related.

<span id="ii.iv.xxiv-p4"></span>Socrates is in error here, as according
to Eusebius (*H. E.* X. 1), immediately after the deposition of
Eustathius and his own refusal of the bishopric of Antioch, Paulinus was
transferred there from the see of Tyre. This was in 329 <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iv.xxiv-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span>, so that no
vacancy of eight years intervened.
