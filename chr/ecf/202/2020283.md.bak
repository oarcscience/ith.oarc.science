<span id="iii.vi.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Concerning the Dispute
between Constantine and Licinius his Brother-In-Law about the
Christians, and how Licinius was conquered by Force and put to Death.*

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p2.1"></span>After</span> this reverse, Licinius, <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) who had previously respected the
Christians, changed his opinion, and ill-treated many of the priests who
<span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="iii.vi.vii-Page_244"></span>lived under his government; he also
persecuted a multitude of other persons, but especially the soldiers. He
was deeply incensed against the Christians on account of his
disagreement with Constantine, and thought to wound him by their
sufferings for religion, and besides, he suspected that the churches
were praying and zealous that Constantine alone should enjoy the
sovereign rule. In addition to all this, when on the eve of another
battle with Constantine, Licinius, as was wont to be done, made a
forecast of the expected war, by sacrifices and oracles, and, deceived
by promises of conquest, he returned to the religion of the pagans.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p4"></span>The pagans themselves, too, relate that
about this period he consulted the oracle of Apollo Didymus at Miletus,
and received an answer concerning the result of the war from the demon,
couched in the following verses of Homer: <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md)

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p6"></span>“Much, old man, do the youths distress
thee, warring against thee!

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p7"></span>Feeble thy strength has become, but thy
old age yet shall be hardy.”

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p8"></span>From many facts it has often appeared to
me that the teaching of the Christians is supported, and its advancement
secured, by the providence of God; and not least from what then
occurred; for at the very moment that Licinius was about to persecute
all the churches under him, the war in Bithynia broke out, which ended
in a war between him and Constantine, and in which Constantine was so
strengthened by Divine assistance that he was victorious over his
enemies by land and by sea. On the destruction of his fleet and army,
Licinius threw himself into Nicomedia, and resided for some time at
Thessalonica as a private individual, and was eventually killed there.
Such was the end of one who, at the beginning of his reign, had
distinguished himself in war and in peace, and who had been honored by
receiving the sister of Constantine in marriage.
