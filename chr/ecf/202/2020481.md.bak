<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Victory of
Theodosius the Emperor over Eugenius*.

<span id="iii.xii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>When</span> he had completed his
preparations for war, <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md)
Theodosius declared his younger son Honorius emperor, and leaving him to
reign at Constantinople conjointly with Arcadius, who had previously
been appointed emperor, he departed from the East to the West at the
head of his troops. His army consisted not only of Roman soldiers, but
of bands of barbarians from the banks of the Ister. It is said that when
he left Constantinople, he came to the seventh milestone, and went to
pray to God in the church which he had erected in honor of John the
Baptist; and in his name prayed that success might attend the Roman
arms, and besought the Baptist himself to aid him. After offering up
these prayers he proceeded towards Italy, crossed the Alps, and took the
first guard-posts. On descending from the heights of these mountains, he
perceived a plain before him covered with infantry and cavalry, and
became at the same time aware that some of the enemy’s troops were lying
in ambush behind him, among the recesses of the mountains. The advance
guard of his army attacked the infantry stationed in the plain, and a
desperate and very doubtful conflict ensued. Further, when the army
surrounded him, he considered that he had come into the power of men,
and could not be saved even by those who would desire to do so, since
those who had been posted in his rear were seizing the heights; he fell
prone upon the earth, and prayed with tears, and God instantly answered
him; for the officers of the troops stationed in ambush on the height
sent to offer him their services as his allies, provided that he would
assign them honorable posts in his army. As he had neither paper nor ink
within reach, he took up some tablets, and wrote on them the high and
befitting appointments he would confer upon them, provided that they
would fulfill their promise to him. Under these conditions they advanced
to the emperor. The issue did not yet incline to either side, but the
battle was still evenly balanced in the plain, when a tremendous wind
descended into the face of the enemy. It was such an one as we have
never before recorded, and broke up the ranks of the enemies. The arrows
and darts which were sent against the Romans, as if projected by the
opposing ranks, were turned upon the bodies of those who had cast them;
and their shields were wrenched from their hands, and whirled against
them with filth and dust. Standing thus exposed, in a defenseless
condition, to the weapons of the Romans, many of them perished, while
the few who attempted to effect an escape were soon captured. Eugenius
threw himself at the feet of the emperor, and implored him to spare his
life; but while in the act of offering up these entreaties, a soldier
struck off his head. Arbogastes fled after the battle, and fell by his
own hands. It is said that while the battle was being fought, a demoniac
presented himself in the temple of God which is in the Hebdomos, where
the emperor had engaged in prayer on starting out, and insulted John the
Baptist, taunting him with having his head cut off, and shouted the
following words: “You conquer me, and lay snares for my army.” The
persons who happened to be on the spot, and who were waiting impatiently
to learn some news of the war, were amazed, and wrote an account of it
on the day that it occurred, and afterwards ascertained that it was the
same day as that on which the battle had been fought. Such is the
history of these transactions.
