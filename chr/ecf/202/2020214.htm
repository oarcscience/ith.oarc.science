  A man, as we have before observed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">894</FONT></A>
  who on account of zeal for temperance was inclined rather to anger than forbearance: and his personal sanctity of character led him to indulge in a latitude of speech which to others was intolerable. Indeed, it is most inexplicable to me, how with a zeal so ardent for the practice of self-control and blamelessness of life, he should in his sermons appear to teach a loose view of temperance. For whereas by the Synod of bishops repentance was accepted but once from those who had sinned after baptism; he did not scruple to say, &#145;Approach, although you may have repented a thousand times.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">895</FONT></A>
  For this doctrine, many even of his friends censured him, but especially Sisinnius bishop of the Novatian; who wrote a book condemnatory of the above quoted expression of Chrysostom&#146;s, and severely rebuked him for it. But this occurred long before.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">896</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.ix.xxii-p5"></A>These words are not found in any of Chrysostom&#146;s extant homilies. There is no reason, however, for thinking that they were not uttered by him in a sermon now not in existence. Socrates&#146; remarks on Chrysostom&#146;s attitude made here are among the considerations which have led some to think that he was a Novatian. Cf. Introd. p. x.</p>
