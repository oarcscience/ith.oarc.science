<span id="iii.ix.xxvii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII</span>.—*Macedonius, after
his Rejection from his See, blasphemes against the Holy Spirit;
Propagation of his Heresy through the Instrumentality of Marathonius and
Others*.

<span id="iii.ix.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.xxvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> spirit of innovation is
self-laudatory, <span id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) and hence it
advanced further and further, and crept along to greater novelties with
increasing self-conceit, and in scorn of the fathers it enacted laws of
its own, nor does it honor the doctrines of the ancients concerning God,
but is always thinking out strange dogmas and restlessly adds novelty to
novelty as the events now show. For after Macedonius had been deposed
from the church of Constantinople, he renounced the tenets of Acacius
and Eudoxius. <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) He began to
teach that the Son is God, and that He is in all respects and in
substance like unto the Father. But he affirmed that the Holy Ghost is
not a participant of the same dignities, and designated Him a minister
and a servant, and applied to Him whatever could, without error, be said
of the holy angels. This doctrine was embraced by Eleusius, Eustathius,
and by all the other bishops who had been deposed at Constantinople, by
the partisans of the opposite heresy. Their example was quickly followed
by no small part of the people of Constantinople, Bithynia, Thrace, the
Hellespont, and of the neighboring provinces. For their mode of life had
no little influence, and to this do the people give special attention.
They assumed great gravity of demeanor, and their discipline was like
that of the monks; their conversation was plain and of a style fitted to
persuade. It is said that all these qualifications were united in
Marathonius. He originally held a public appointment in the army, under
the command of the prefect. After amassing some money in this
employment, he quit military science, and undertook the superintendence
of the establishments for the relief of the sick and the destitute.
Afterwards, at the suggestion of Eustathius, bishop of Sebaste, he
embraced an ascetic mode of life, and founded a monastical institution
in Constantinople which exists to the present day. He brought so much
zeal, and so much of his own wealth to the support of the aforesaid
heresy, that the Macedonians were by many termed Marathonians, and it
seems to me not without reason; for it appears that he alone, together
with his institutions, was the cause that it was not altogether
extinguished in Constantinople. In fact, after the deposition of
Macedonius, the Macedonians possessed neither churches nor bishops until
the reign of Arcadius. <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md)

<span id="iii.ix.xxvii-p6"></span>The Arians, who drove out of the
churches and rigorously persecuted all who held different <span
id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span
id="iii.ix.xxvii-Page_323"></span>sentiments from themselves, deprived
them of all these privileges. It would be no easy task to enumerate the
names of the priests who were at this period ejected from their own
cities; for I believe that no province of the empire was exempted from
such a calamity.

[Next: The Arians, under the Impression that the divine Meletius upheld
their Sentiments, translate him from Sebaste to Antioch. On his Bold
Confession of the Orthodox Doctrines, they were confounded, and after
they had deposed him they placed Euzoïus in the See. Meletius formed his
own Church: but those who held to Consubstantiality turned away from him
because he had been ordained by Arians.](2020390.md)
