<span id="ii.x.xxxi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI</span>.—*Nestorius harasses the
Macedonians.*

<span id="ii.x.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxi-p2.1"></span>Nestorius</span> indeed acted contrary to the
usage of the Church, and caused himself to be hated in other ways
also, <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000.md) as is evident from what
happened during his episcopate. For Anthony bishop of Germa, a city of
the Hellespont, actuated by the example of Nestorius in his intolerance
of heretics, began to persecute the Macedonians, under the pretext of
carrying out the intentions of the patriarch. The Macedonians for some
time endured his annoyance; but when Anthony proceeded to farther
extremities, unable any longer to bear his harsh treatment, they were
led to a sad desperation, and suborning two men, who put right in a
secondary place and profit first, they assassinated their tormenter.
When the Macedonians had perpetrated this crime, Nestorius took occasion
from it to increase his violence of conduct against them, and prevailed
on the emperor to take away their churches. They were therefore deprived
of not only those which they possessed at Constantinople, before the old
walls of the imperial city, but of those also which they had at Cyzicus,
and many others that belonged to them in the rural districts of the
Hellespont. Many of them therefore at that time came over to the
Catholic church, and professed the ‘homoousian’ faith. But as the
proverb says, ‘drunkards never want wine, nor the contentious strife’:
and so it fell out with regard to Nestorius, who after having exerted
himself to expel others from the church, was himself ejected on the
following account.

<span id="ii.x.xxxi-p3"></span>By a slight change in the Greek text
Valesius renders this phrase ‘but caused others also to imitate him,’
alleging that the conduct of Anthony of Germa was in imitation of
Nestorius; but the emendation seems unnecessary. Socrates means that
Nestorius made himself odious in other ways, perhaps through other
persons such as Anthony, &c.
