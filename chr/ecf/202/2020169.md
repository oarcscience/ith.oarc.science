<span id="ii.viii.v-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*The Macedonians, who had
subscribed the ‘Homoousian’ Doctrine, return to their Former Error.*

<span id="ii.viii.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.v-p2.1"></span>After</span> the deputation from the
Macedonians to Liberius, that sect was admitted to entire communion with
the churches in every city, intermixing themselves indiscriminately with
those who from the beginning had embraced the form of faith published at
Nicæa. But when the law of the Emperor Gratian permitted the several
sects to reunite without restraint in the public services of religion,
they again resolved to separate themselves; and having met at Antioch in
Syria, they decided to avoid the word *homoousios* again, and in no way
to hold communion with the supporters of the Nicene Creed. They however
derived no advantage from this attempt; for the majority of their own
party being disgusted at the fickleness with which they sometimes
maintained one opinion, and then another, withdrew from them, and
thenceforward became firm adherents of those who professed the doctrine
of the *homoousion.* <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686)

church, see IV. 12.
