id="ii.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*Certain Presbyters
burnt in a Ship by Order of Valens. Famine in Phrygia.*

<span id="ii.vii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Certain</span> pious men of the clerical
order, eighty in number, among whom Urbanus, Theodore, and Menedemus
were the leaders, proceeded to Nicomedia, and there presented to the
emperor a supplicatory petition, informing him and complaining of the
ill-usage to which they had been subjected. The emperor was filled with
wrath; but dissembled his displeasure in their presence, and gave
Modestus the prefect a secret order to apprehend these persons, and put
them to death. The manner in which they were destroyed being unusual,
deserves to be recorded. The prefect fearing that he should excite the
populace to a seditious movement against himself, if he attempted the
public execution of so many, pretended to send the men away into exile.
Accordingly as they received the intelligence of their destiny with
great firmness of mind the prefect ordered that they should be embarked
as if to be conveyed to their several places of banishment, having
meanwhile enjoined on the sailors to set the vessel on fire, as soon as
they reached the mid sea, that their victims being so destroyed, might
even be deprived of burial. This injunction was obeyed; for when they
arrived at the middle of the Astacian Gulf, the crew set fire to the
ship, and then took refuge in a small barque which followed them, and so
escaped. Meanwhile it came to pass that a strong easterly wind blew, and
the burning ship was roughly driven but moved faster and was preserved
until it reached a port named Dacidizus, where it was utterly consumed
together with the men who were shut up in it. Many have asserted that
this impious deed was not suffered to go unpunished: for there
immediately after arose so great a famine throughout all Phrygia, that a
large proportion of the inhabitants were obliged to abandon their
country for a time, and betake themselves some to Constantinople and
some to other provinces. For Constantinople, notwithstanding the vast
population it supplies, yet always abounds with the necessaries of life,
all manner of provisions being imported into it by sea from various
regions; and the Euxine which lies near it, furnishes it with wheat to
any extent it may require. <span id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609.md)
