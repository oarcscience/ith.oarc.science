<span id="ii.v.xxxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII</span>.—*Of the Jews
inhabiting Dio-Cæsarea in Palestine.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>About</span> the same time there arose
another intestine commotion in the East: for the Jews who inhabited
Dio-Cæsarea in Palestine took up arms against the Romans, and began to
ravage the adjacent places. But Gallus who was also called Constantius,
whom the emperor, after creating Cæsar, had sent into the East,
despatched an army against them, and completely vanquished them: after
which he ordered that their city Dio-Cæsarea should be razed to the
foundations.
