took place about this period, George persecuted <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288) all those throughout Egypt who
refused to conform to his sentiments. The emperor marched into Illyria,
and entered Sirmium, whither Vetranio had repaired by appointment. The
soldiers who had proclaimed him emperor suddenly changed their mind, and
saluted Constantius as sole sovereign, and as Augustus, for both the
emperor and his supporters, strove for this very action. Vetranio
perceived that he was betrayed, and threw himself as a suppliant at the
feet of Constantius. Constantius pitied him indeed, but stripped him of
the imperial ornaments and purple, obliged him to return to private
life, liberally provided for his wants out of the public treasury, and
told him that it was more seemly to an old man to abstain from the cares
of empire and to live in quietude. After terminating these arrangements
in favor of Vetranio, Constantius sent a large army into Italy against
Magnentius. He then conferred the title of Cæsar on his cousin Gallus,
and sent him into Syria to defend the provinces of the East.
