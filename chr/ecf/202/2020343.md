<span id="iii.viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span
id="iii.viii.vi-Page_286"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*Eusebius surnamed
Emesenus; Gregory accepted Alexandria; Athanasius seeks Refuge in Rome*.

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.vi-p2.1"></span>Eusebius,</span> surnamed Emesenus,
likewise attended the council. <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) He sprang from a noble family of
Edessa, a city of Osroënæ. According to the custom of his country, he
had from his youth upwards, learned the Holy Word, and was afterwards
made acquainted with the learning of the Greeks, by the teachers who
then frequented his native city. He subsequently acquired a more
intimate knowledge of sacred literature under the guidance of Eusebius
Pamphilus and Patrophilus, the president of Scythopolis. He went to
Antioch at the time that Eustathius was deposed on the accusation of
Cyrus, and lived with Euphronius, his successor, on terms of intimacy.
He fled to escape being invested with the priestly dignity, went to
Alexandria and frequented the schools of the philosophers. After
acquainting himself with their mode of discipline, he returned to
Antioch and dwelt with Placetus, the successor of Euphronius. During the
time that the council was held in that city, Eusebius, bishop of
Constantinople, entreated him to accept the see of Alexandria for it was
thought that, by his great reputation for sanctity and consummate
eloquence, he would easily supplant Athanasius in the esteem of the
Egyptians. He, however, refused the ordination, on the plea that he
could otherwise only incur the ready hatred of the Alexandrians, who
would have no other bishop but Athanasius. Gregory was, therefore,
appointed to the church of Alexandria, and Eusebius to that of Emesa.

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p4"></span>There he suffered from a sedition; for
the people accused him of practicing that variety of astronomy which is
called astrological, and being obliged to seek safety by flight, he
repaired to Laodicea, and dwelt with George, bishop of that city, who
was his particular friend. He afterwards accompanied this bishop to
Antioch, and obtained permission from the bishops Placetus and Narcissus
to return to Emesa. He was much esteemed by the emperor Constantius, and
attended him in his military expedition against the Persians. It is said
that God wrought miracles through his instrumentality, as is testified
by George of Laodicea, <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) who
has related these and other incidents about him.

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p6"></span>But although he was endowed with so
many exalted qualities, he could not escape the jealousy of those who
are irritated by witnessing the virtues of others. He endured the
censure of having embraced the doctrines of Sabellius. At the present
time, however, he voted with the bishops who had been convened at
Antioch. It is said that Maximus, bishop of Jerusalem, purposely, kept
aloof from this council, because he repented having unawares consented
to the deposition of Athanasius. <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md) The manager of the Roman see, nor
any representative from the east of Italy, nor from the parts beyond
Rome were present at Antioch. <span id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md)
At the same period of time, the Franks devastated Western Gaul; and the
provinces of the East, and more particularly Antioch after the Synod,
were visited by tremendous earthquakes. <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md) After the Synod, Gregory repaired
to Alexandria with a large body of soldiers, who were enjoined to
provide an undisturbed and safe entrance into the city; the Arians also,
who were anxious for the expulsion of Athanasius, sided with him.
Athanasius, fearful lest the people should be exposed to sufferings on
his account, <span id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) assembled them
by night in the church, and when the soldiers came to take possession of
the church, prayers having been concluded, he first ordered a psalm to
be sung. During the chanting of this psalm the soldiers remained without
and quietly awaited its conclusion, and in the meantime Athanasius
passed under the singers and secretly made his escape, and fled to Rome.
In this manner Gregory possessed himself of the see of Alexandria. The
indignation of the people was aroused, and they burnt the church which
bore the name of Dionysius, one of their former bishops.
