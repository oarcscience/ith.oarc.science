<span id="ii.x.xxx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*The Burgundians embrace
Christianity under Theodosius the Younger.*

<span id="ii.x.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxx-p2.1"></span>I must</span> now relate an event well worthy
of <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="ii.x.xxx-Page_170"></span>being recorded, which happened about this
time. There is a barbarous nation dwelling beyond the Rhine, denominated
Burgundians; they lead a peaceful life; for being almost all artisans,
they support themselves by the exercise of their trades. The Huns, by
making continual irruptions on this people, devastated their country,
and often destroyed great numbers of them. In this perplexity,
therefore, the Burgundians resolved to have recourse not to any human
being, but to commit themselves to the protection of some god: and
having seriously considered that the God of the Romans mightily defended
those that feared him, they all with common consent embraced the faith
of Christ. Going therefore to one of the cities of Gaul, they requested
the bishop to grant them Christian baptism: who ordering them to fast
seven days, and having meanwhile instructed them in the elementary
principles of the faith, on the eighth day baptized and dismissed them.
Accordingly becoming confident thenceforth, they marched against their
invaders; nor were they disappointed in their hope. For the king of the
Huns, Uptar <span id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998.md) by name, having died
in the night from the effects of a surfeit, the Burgundians attacked
that people then without a commander-in-chief; and although they were
few in numbers and their opponents very many, they obtained a complete
victory; for the Burgundians were altogether but three thousand men, and
destroyed no less than ten thousand of the enemy. From that period this
nation became zealously attached to the Christian religion. About the
same time Barbas bishop of the Arians died, on the 24th of June, under
the thirteenth consulate of Theodosius, <span
id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999.md) and the third of Valentinian, and
Sabbatius was constituted his successor. Enough has been said of these
matters.
