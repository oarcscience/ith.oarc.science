id="iii.viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*A Sedition was excited
on the Ordination of Paul*.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.iv-p2.1"></span>The</span> ordination of Paul occasioned a
great commotion in the Church of Constantinople. <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219) During the life of Alexander, the
Arians did not act very openly; for the people by being attentive to him
were well governed and honored Divine things, and especially believed
that the unexpected occurrence which befell Arius, whom they believed
met such a death, was the Divine wrath, drawn down by the imprecations
of Alexander. After the death of this bishop, however, the people became
divided into two parties, and disputes and contests concerning doctrines
were openly carried on. The adherents of Arius desired the ordination of
Macedonius, while those who maintained that the Son is consubstantial
with the Farther wished to have Paul as their bishop; and this latter
party prevailed. After the ordination of Paul, the emperor, who chanced
to be away from home, returned to Constantinople, and manifested as much
displeasure at what had taken place as though the bishopric had been
conferred upon an unworthy man. Through the machinations of the enemies
of Paul a Synod was convened, and he was expelled from the Church. It
handed over the Church of Constantinople to Eusebius, bishop of
Nicomedia.
