<span id="iii.x.xxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*From Aversion to the
Christians, Julian granted Permission to the Jews to rebuild the Temple
at Jerusalem; in every Endeavor to put their Hands to the Work, Fire
sprang upward and killed Many. About the Sign of the Cross which
appeared on the Clothing of those who had exerted themselves in this
Work*.

<span id="iii.x.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xxii-p2.1"></span>Though</span> the emperor <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) hated and oppressed the Christians,
he manifested benevolence and humanity towards the Jews. He wrote <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) to the Jewish patriarchs and
leaders, as well as to the people, requesting them to pray for him, and
for the prosperity of the empire. In taking this step he was not
actuated, I am convinced, by any respect for their religion; for he was
aware that it is, so to speak, the mother of the Christian religion, and
he knew that both religions rest upon the authority of the patriarchs
and the prophets; but he thought to grieve the Christians by favoring
the Jews, who are their most inveterate enemies. But perhaps he also
calculated upon persuading the Jews to embrace paganism and sacrifices;
for they were only acquainted with the mere letter of Scripture, and
could not, like the Christians and a few of the wisest among the
Hebrews, discern the hidden meaning.

<span id="iii.x.xxii-p5"></span>Events proved that this was his real
motive; for he sent for some of the chiefs of the race and exhorted them
to return to the observance of the laws of Moses and the customs of
their fathers. On their replying that because the temple in Jerusalem
was overturned, it was neither lawful nor ancestral to do this in
another place than the metropolis out of which they had been cast, he
gave them public money, commanded them to rebuild the temple, and to
practice the cult similar to that of their ances<span id="page_344">p.
344</span> <span id="iii.x.xxii-Page_344"></span>tors, by sacrificing
after the ancient way. The Jews entered upon the undertaking, without
reflecting that, according to the prediction of the holy prophets, it
could not be accomplished. They sought for the most skillful artisans,
collected materials, cleared the ground, and entered so earnestly upon
the task, that even the women carried heaps of earth, and brought their
necklaces and other female ornaments towards defraying the expense. The
emperor, the other pagans, and all the Jews, regarded every other
undertaking as secondary in importance to this. Although the pagans were
not well-disposed towards the Jews, yet they assisted them in this
enterprise, because they reckoned upon its ultimate success, and hoped
by this means to falsify the prophecies of Christ. Besides this motive,
the Jews themselves were impelled by the consideration that the time had
arrived for rebuilding their temple. When they had removed the ruins of
the former building, they dug up the ground and cleared away its
foundation; it is said that on the following day when they were about to
lay the first foundation, a great earthquake occurred, and by the
violent agitation of the earth, stones were thrown up from the depths,
by which those of the Jews who were engaged in the work were wounded, as
likewise those who were merely looking on. The houses and public
porticos, near the site of the temple, in which they had diverted
themselves, were suddenly thrown down; many were caught thereby, some
perished immediately, others were found half dead and mutilated of hands
or legs, others were injured in other parts of the body. When God caused
the earthquake to cease, the workmen who survived again returned to
their task, partly because such was the edict of the emperor, and partly
because they were themselves interested in the undertaking. Men often,
in endeavoring to gratify their own passions, seek what is injurious to
them, reject what would be truly advantageous, and are deluded by the
idea that nothing is really useful except what is agreeable to them.
When once led astray by this error, they are no longer able to act in a
manner conducive to their own interests, or to take warning by the
calamities which are visited upon them.

<span id="iii.x.xxii-p6"></span>The Jews, I believe, were just in this
state; for, instead of regarding this unexpected earthquake as a
manifest indication that God was opposed to the re-erection of their
temple, they proceeded to recommence the work. But all parties relate,
that they had scarcely returned to the undertaking, when fire burst
suddenly from the foundations of the temple, and consumed several of the
workmen.

<span id="iii.x.xxii-p7"></span>This fact is fearlessly stated, and
believed by all; the only discrepancy in the narrative is that some
maintain that flame burst from the interior of the temple, as the
workmen were striving to force an entrance, while others say that the
fire proceeded directly from the earth. In whichever way the phenomenon
might have occurred, it is equally wonderful. A more tangible and still
more extraordinary prodigy ensued; suddenly the sign of the cross
appeared spontaneously on the garments of the persons engaged in the
undertaking. These crosses were disposed like stars, and appeared the
work of art. Many were hence led to confess that Christ is God, and that
the rebuilding of the temple was not pleasing to Him; others presented
themselves in the church, were initiated, and besought Christ, with
hymns and supplications, to pardon their transgression. If any one does
not feel disposed to believe my narrative, let him go and be convinced
by those who heard the facts I have related from the eyewitnesses of
them, for they are still alive. Let him inquire, also, of the Jews and
pagans who left the work in an incomplete state, or who, to speak more
accurately, were able to commence it.
