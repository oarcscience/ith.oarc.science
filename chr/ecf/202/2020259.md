id="ii.x.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLII</span>.—*Panegyric of the
Emperor Theodosius Younger.* <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029.md)

<span id="ii.x.xlii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xlii-p3.1"></span>For</span> these reasons the emperor had the
highest esteem for Proclus. For in fact he himself was a pattern to all
true clergymen, and never approved of those who attempted to persecute
others. Nay I may venture to affirm, that in meekness he surpassed all
those who have ever faithfully borne the sacerdotal office. And what is
recorded of Moses in the book of Numbers, <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) ‘Now the man Moses was very meek,
above all the men which were upon the face of the earth’—may most justly
be applied at this day; for the Emperor Theodosius is ‘meek above all
the men which are upon the face of the earth.’ It is because of this
meekness that God subdued his enemies without martial conflicts, as the
capture of the usurper John, <span id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md)
and the subsequent discomfiture of the barbarians clearly demonstrate.
For the God of the universe has afforded this most devout emperor in our
times supernatural aid of a similar kind to what was vouchsafed to the
righteous heretofore. I write not these things from adulation, but
truthfully narrate facts such as everybody can attest.
