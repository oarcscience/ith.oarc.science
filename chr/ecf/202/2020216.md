id="ii.ix.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Death of the Emperor
Arcadius.*

<span id="ii.ix.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Not</span> long after the death of John, the
Emperor Arcadius died also. This prince was of a mild and gentle
disposition, and toward the close of his life was esteemed to be greatly
beloved of God, from the following circumstance. There was at
Constantinople an immense mansion called Carya; for in the court of it
there is a walnut tree on which it is said Acacius suffered martyrdom by
hanging; on which account a chapel was built near it, which the Emperor
Arcadius one day thought fit to visit, and after having prayed there,
left again. All who lived near this chapel ran in a crowd to see the
emperor; and some going out of the mansion referred to, endeavored to
preoccupy the streets in order to get a better view of their sovereign
and his suite, while others followed in his train, until all who
inhabited it, including the women and children, had wholly gone out of
it. No sooner was this vast pile emptied of its occupants, the buildings
of which completely environed the church, than the entire building fell.
On which there was a great outcry, followed by shouts of admiration,
because it was believed the emperor’s prayer had rescued so great a
number of persons from destruction. This event occurred in that manner.
On the 1st of May, Arcadius died, leaving his son Theodosius only eight
years old, under the consulate of Bassus and Philip, in the second year
of the 297th Olympiad. <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900) He had
reigned thirteen years with Theodosius his father, and fourteen years
after his death, and had then attained the thirty-first year of his age.
This book includes the space of twelve years and six months. <span
