<span id="iii.ix.ix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Council of Milan. Flight
of Athanasius*.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) was extremely urgent to convene a
council in Milan, yet few of the Eastern bishops repaired thither; some,
it appears, excused themselves from attendance under the plea of
illness; others, on account of the length and difficulties of the
journey. There were, however, upwards of three hundred of the Western
bishops at the council. The Eastern bishops insisted that Athanasius
should be condemned to banishment, and expelled from Alexandria; and the
others, either from fear, fraud, or ignorance, assented to the measure.
Dionysius, bishop of Alba, the metropolis of Italy, Eusebius, bishop of
Vercella in Liguria, Paulinus, bishop of Treves, Rhodanus, <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) and Lucifer, were the only bishops
who protested against this decision; and they declared that Athanasius
ought not to be condemned on such slight pretexts; and that the evil
would not cease with his condemnation; but that those who supported the
orthodox doctrines concerning the Godhead would be forthwith subjected
to a plot. They represented that the whole measure was a scheme
concerted by the emperor and the Arians with the view of suppressing the
Nicene faith. Their boldness was punished by an edict of immediate
banishment, and Hilary was exiled with them. The result too plainly
showed for what purpose the council of Milan had been convened. For the
councils which were held shortly after at Ariminum and Seleucia were
evidently designed to change the doctrines established by the Nicæan
council, as I shall directly show.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p5"></span>Athanasius, being apprised that plots had
been formed against him at court, deemed it prudent not to repair to the
emperor himself, as he knew that his life would be thereby endangered,
nor did he think that it would be of any avail. He, however, selected
five of the Egyptian bishops, among whom was Serapion, bishop of Thumis,
a prelate distinguished by the wonderful sanctity of his life and the
power of his eloquence, and sent them with three presbyters of the
Church to the emperor, who was then in the West. They were directed to
attempt, if possible, to conciliate the emperor; to reply, if requisite,
to the calumnies of the hostile party; and to take such measures as they
deemed most advisable for the welfare of the Church and himself. Shortly
after they had embarked on their voyage, Athanasius received some
letters from the emperor, summoning him to the palace. Athanasius and
all the people of the Church were greatly troubled at this command; for
they considered that no safety could be enjoyed when acting either in
obedience or in disobedience to an emperor of heterodox sentiments. It
was, however, determined that he should remain at Alexandria, and the
bearer of the letters quitted the city without having effected anything.
The following summer, another messenger from the emperor arrived with
the governors of the provinces, and he was charged to urge the departure
of Athanasius from the city, and to act with hostility against the
clergy. When he perceived, however, that the people of the Church were
full of courage, and ready to take up arms, he also departed from the
city without accomplishing his mission. Not long after, troops, called
the Roman legions, which were quartered in Egypt and Libya, marched into
Alexandria. As it was reported that Athanasius was concealed in the
church known by the name “Theonas,” the commander of the troops, and
Hilary, <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) whom the emperor had
again intrusted with the transaction of this affair, caused the doors of
the church to be burst open, and thus effected their entrance; but they
did not find Athanasius within the walls, although they sought for him
everywhere. It is said that he escaped this and many other perils by the
Divine interposition; and that God had disclosed this previously;
directly as he went out, the soldiers took the doors of the church, and
were within a little of seizing him.
