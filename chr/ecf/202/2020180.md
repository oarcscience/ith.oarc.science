<span id="ii.viii.xvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*Of Flavian Bishop of
Antioch.*

<span id="ii.viii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xvi-p2.1"></span>About</span> the same period, the following
events took place at Antioch in Syria. After the death of Paulinus, the
people who had been under his superintendence refused to submit to the
authority of Flavian, but caused Evagrius to be ordained bishop of their
own party. <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734) As he did not survive
his ordination long, no other was constituted in his place, Flavian
having brought this about: nevertheless those who disliked Flavian on
account of his having violated his oath, held their assemblies
apart. <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735) Meanwhile Flavian ‘left
no stone unturned,’ as the phrase is, to bring these also under his
control; and this he soon after effected, when he appeased the anger of
Theophilus, then bishop of Alex<span id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span
id="ii.viii.xvi-Page_126"></span>andria, by whose mediation he
conciliated, Damasus bishop of Rome also. For both these had been
greatly displeased with Flavian, as well for the perjury of which he had
been guilty, as for the schism he had occasioned among the previously
united people. Theophilus therefore being pacified, sent Isidore a
presbyter to Rome, and thus reconciled Damasus, who was still offended;
representing to him the propriety of overlooking Flavian’s past
misconduct, for the sake of producing concord among the people.
Communion being in this way restored to Flavian, the people of Antioch
were in the course of a little while induced to acquiesce in the union
secured. Such was the conclusion of this affair at Antioch. But the
Arians of that city being ejected from the churches, were accustomed to
hold their meetings in the suburbs. Meanwhile Cyril bishop of Jerusalem
having died about this time, <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736) was
succeeded by John.

<span id="ii.viii.xvi-p3"></span>Theodoret (*H. E.* V. 23) says that
there was a double violation of order in the ordination of Evagrius;
first in that he was ordained by his predecessor, and secondly in that
he was ordained by one bishop, whereas the canon required that not less
than three should take part in an episcopal ordination.
