id="ii.vii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII</span>.—*After the
Departure of Valens from Antioch, the Alexandrians expel Lucius, and
restore Peter, who had come with Letters from Damasus Bishop of Rome.*

<span id="ii.vii.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>About</span> the same time, as soon as
the Emperor Valens left Antioch, all those who had anywhere been
suffering persecution began again to take courage, and especially those
of Alexandria. Peter returned to that city from Rome, with letters from
Damasus the Roman bishop, in which he confirmed the ‘homoousian’ faith,
and sanctioned Peter’s ordination. The people therefore resuming
confidence, expelled Lucius, who immediately embarked for
Constantinople: but Peter survived his re-establishment a very short
time, and at his death appointed his brother Timothy to succeed him.

Goths; undertakes an Expedition against them and is slain in an
