<span id="ii.iv.v-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*The Dispute of Arius with
Alexander, his Bishop.*

<span id="ii.iv.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.v-p2.1"></span>After</span> Peter, bishop of Alexandria, had
suffered martyrdom under Diocletian, Achillas was installed in the
episcopal office, whom Alexander succeeded, during the period of peace
above referred to. He, in the fearless exercise of his functions for the
instruction and government of the Church, attempted one day in the
presence of the presbytery and the rest of his clergy, to explain, with
perhaps too philosophical minuteness, that great theological
mystery—*the* <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iv.v-p2.2"></span>Unity</span> *of the Holy Trinity.* A certain
one of the presbyters under his jurisdiction, whose name was Arius,
possessed of no inconsiderable logical acumen, imaging that the bishop
was subtly teaching the same view of this subject as Sabellius the
Libyan, <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118) from love of controversy
took the opposite opinion to that of the Libyan, and as he thought
vigorously responded to what was said by the bishop. ‘If,’ said he, ‘the
Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence:
and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not.
It therefore necessarily follows, that he had his substance <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119) from nothing.’

<span id="ii.iv.v-p3"></span>Though Sabellius was the originator of one
of the earliest and most plausible attempts at explanation of the
mystery of the Trinity (for which see life of Sabellius in Smith and
Wace, *Dict. of Christian Biog.*, and Hodge, *System. Theol.* Vol. I. p.
452, 459), nothing is known of him, not even why he is called a Libyan
here (also by other ancient writers, e.g. Philastrius, *de Hæres.* 26,
and Asterius, quoted by Phot. *Biblioth. Cod.* 27). Some say that he was
a native and resident of Libya, others that he was an ecclesiastic
appointed to some position there; nor is it known whether the Libya
meant is the Libyan Pentapolis or the Pentapolitan Ptolemais.

<span id="ii.iv.v-p4"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.v-p4.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.v-p4.2"></span>πόστασιν</span>. Through the Arian controversy
this word is used in its metaphysical sense of ‘real nature of a thing
as underlying and supporting its outward form and properties’; hence it
is equivalent to the Latin *substantia,* Eng. *essence* and Greek <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.v-p4.3"></span>οὐσία</span>. Cf. below
III. 7. Later it was applied to the ‘special or characteristic nature of
a thing,’ and so became the very opposite of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.v-p4.4"></span>οὐσία</span> (the general nature); hence
equivalent to *person.*
