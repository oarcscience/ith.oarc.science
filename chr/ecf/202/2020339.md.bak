<span id="iii.viii.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Return of Athanasius
the Great from Rome; Letter of Constantine Cæsar, Son of Constantine the
Great; Renewed Machinations of the Arians against Athanasius; Acacius of
Berrœa; War between Constans and Constantine*.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.ii-p2.1"></span>At</span> this period Athanasius returned
from Gaul to Alexandria. <span id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md) It
is said that Constantine intended to have recalled him, and that in his
testament he even gave orders to that effect. But as he was prevented by
death from performing his intention, his son who bore his name, and who
was then commanding in Western Gaul, recalled Athanasius, and wrote a
letter on the subject to the people of Alexandria. Having met with a
copy of this letter translated from the Latin into Greek, I shall insert
it precisely as I found it. It is as follows:—

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p4"></span>“Constantine Cæsar, to the people of
the Catholic Church in the city of Alexandria. <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md)

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p6"></span>“You cannot, I believe, be unacquainted
with the fact that Athanasius, the interpreter of the venerated law,
since the cruelty of his bloodthirsty and hostile enemies continued, to
the danger of his sacred person, was sent for a time into Gaul in order
that he might not incur irretrievable extremities through the perversity
of these worthless opponents; in order then to make this danger futile,
he was taken out of the jaws of the men, who pressed upon him, and was
commanded to live near me, so that in the city where he dwelt, he might
be amply furnished with all necessaries; but his virtue is so famous and
extraordinary, because he is confident of Divine aid, that he sets at
naught all the rougher burdens of fortune. Our lord and my father,
Constantine Augustus, of blessed memory, intended to have reinstated
this bishop in his own place, and thus especially to have restored him
to your much beloved piety; but, since he was anticipated by the human
lot, and died before fulfilling his intention, I, as his successor,
purpose to carry into execution the design of the emperor of Divine
memory. Athanasius will inform you, when he shall see your face, in how
great reverence he was held by me. Nor is it surprising that I should
have acted as I have done towards him, for the image of your own desire
and the appearance of so noble a man, moved and impelled me to this
step. May Divine Providence watch over you, my beloved brethren.”

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p7"></span>In consequence of this letter from the
emperor Athanasius went home, and resumed the government of the Egyptian
churches. Those who were attached to the Arian doctrines were thrown
<span id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="iii.viii.ii-Page_284"></span>into consternation and could not keep
the peace; they excited continuous seditions, and had recourse to other
machinations against him. The partisans of Eusebius accused him before
the emperor of being a seditious person, and of having reversed the
decree of exile, contrary to the laws of the church, and without the
consent of the bishops. I shall presently relate in the proper place,
how, by their intrigues, Athanasius was again expelled from Alexandria.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p8"></span>Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus,
died <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md) about this period, and
Acacius succeeded to the bishopric of Cæsarea in Palestine. He was a
zealous imitator of Eusebius because he had been instructed by him in
the Sacred Word; he possessed a capable mind and was polished in
expression, so that he left many writings worthy of commendation. Not
long after, <span id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) the emperor
Constantine declared war against his brother Constans at Aquileia, <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) and was slain by his own generals.
The Roman Empire was divided between the surviving brothers; the West
fell to the lot of Constans and the East to Constantius.
