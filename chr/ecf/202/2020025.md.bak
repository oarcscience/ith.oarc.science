<span id="ii.iv.xvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*The Emperor Constantine
having enlarged the Ancient Byzantium, calls it Constantinople.*

<span id="ii.iv.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xvi-p2.1"></span>After</span> the Synod the emperor spent some
time in recreation, and after the public celebration of his twentieth
anniversary of his accession, <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) he
immediately devoted himself to the reparation of the churches. This he
carried into effect in other cities as well as in the city named after
him, which being previously called Byzantium, he enlarged, surrounded
with massive walls, <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) and adorned
with various edifices; <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xvi-Page_21"></span>and having rendered it equal to imperial
Rome, he named it *Constantinople,* establishing by law that it should
be designated *New Rome.* This law was engraven on a pillar of stone
erected in public view in the Strategium, <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) near the emperor’s equestrian
statue. <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) He built also in the
same city two churches, one of which he named *Irene,* and the other
*The Apostles.* <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) Nor did he only
improve the affairs of the Christians, as I have said, but he also
destroyed the superstition of the heathens; for he brought forth their
images into public view to ornament the city of Constantinople, and set
up the Delphic tripods publicly in the Hippodrome. It may indeed seem
now superfluous to mention these things, since they are seen before they
are heard of. But at that time the Christian cause received its greatest
augmentation; for Divine Providence preserved very many other things
during the times of the emperor Constantine. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) Eusebius Pamphilus has in magnificent
terms recorded the praises of the emperor; <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) and I considered it would not be
ill-timed to advert thus to them as concisely as possible.
