id="ii.x.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*A Paralytic Jew healed by
Atticus in Baptism.*

<span id="ii.x.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.iv-p2.1"></span>This</span> was one important improvement in
the circumstances of the Church, which happened during the
administration of Atticus. Nor were these times without the attestation
of miracles and healings. For a certain Jew being a paralytic had been
confined to his bed for many years; and as every sort of medical skill,
and the prayers of his Jewish brethren had been resorted to but had
availed nothing, he had recourse at length to Christian baptism,
trusting in it as the only true remedy to be used. <span
id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909) When Atticus the bishop was informed
of his wishes, he instructed him in the first principles of Christian
truth, and having preached to him to hope in Christ, directed that he
should be brought in his bed to the font. The paralytic Jew receiving
baptism with a sincere faith, as soon as he was taken out of the
baptismal font found himself perfectly cured of his disease, and
continued to enjoy sound health afterwards. This miraculous power Christ
vouchsafed to be manifested even in our times; and the fame of it caused
many heathens to believe and be baptized. But the Jews although
zealously ‘seeking after signs,’ <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910)
not even the signs which actually took place induced to embrace the
faith. Such blessings were thus conferred by Christ upon men.
