id="ii.x.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Sisinnius is chosen to
succeed Atticus.*

<span id="ii.x.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxvi-p2.1"></span>After</span> the decease of Atticus, there
arose a strong contest about the election of a successor, some proposing
one person, and some another. One party, they say, was urgent in favor
of a presbyter named Philip; another wished to promote Proclus who was
also a presbyter; but the general desire of the people was that the
bishopric should be conferred on Sisinnius. This person was also a
presbyter but held no ecclesiastical office within the city, having been
appointed to the sacred ministry in a church at Elæa, a village in the
suburbs of Constantinople. This village is situated across the harbor
from the city, and in it from an ancient custom the whole population
annually assembled for the celebration of our Saviour’s ascension. All
of the laity were warmly attached to the man because he was famous for
his piety, and especially because he was diligent in the care of the
poor even ‘beyond his power.’ <span id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md)
The earnestness of the laity thus prevailed, and Sisinnius was ordained
on the twenty-eighth day of February, under the following consulate,
which was the twelfth of Theodosius, and the second of
Valentinian. <span id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md) The presbyter
Philip was so chagrined at the preference of another to himself, that he
even introduced the subject into his *Christian History*, <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) making some very censorious remarks,
both about the person ordained and those who had ordained him, and much
more severely on the laity. But he said such things as I cannot by any
means commit to writing. Since I do not approve of his unadvised action
in committing them to writing, I do not deem it unseasonable, however,
to give some notice here of him and of his works.

chap. 35, mentions Philip’s attack on Sisinnius and assigns the reason
for it as jealousy, because Philip and Sisinnius both being of the same
rank in the clergy, the latter was made archbishop of Constantinople.
