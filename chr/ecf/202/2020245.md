<span id="ii.x.xxviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII</span>.—*Proclus ordained
Bishop of Cyzicus by Sisinnius, but rejected by the People.*

<span id="ii.x.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> bishop of Cyzicus having died,
Sisinnius ordained Proclus to the bishopric of that city. But while he
was preparing to depart thither, the inhabitants anticipated him, by
electing an ascetic named Dalmatius. This they did in disregard of a law
which forbade their ordination of a bishop without the sanction of the
bishop of Constantinople; <span id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990.md) but
they pretended that <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> <span
id="ii.x.xxviii-Page_169"></span>this was a special privilege granted to
Atticus personally. Proclus therefore continued destitute of the
presidency over his own church, but acquired celebrity for his
discourses in the churches of Constantinople. We shall however speak of
him more particularly in an appropriate place. Sisinnius having survived
his appointment to the bishopric by barely two entire years, was removed
by death on the 24th of December, in the consulate of Hierius and
Ardaburius. <span id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991.md) For his temperance,
integrity of life, and benignity to the poor, he was deservedly eminent;
he was moreover singularly affable and guileless in disposition, and
this rendered him rather averse to business, so that by men of active
habits he was accounted indolent.

<span id="ii.x.xxviii-p3"></span>The Council in its 6th Canon declared
that no one should be ordained bishop without the consent of his
metropolitan; but that the bishop of Constantinople was the metropolitan
of the Cyzicenes does not appear unless the decree of the (Canon 3d)
Council of Constantinople making the latter a patriarchate is to be
understood as rendering the see of Cyzicus subordinate to that of
Constantinople, as an individual church is to the metropolitan. Cf.
Bingham, *Christ. Antiq.* II. 16. 12.
