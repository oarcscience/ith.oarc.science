<span id="iii.xi.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—</span>*The Reign of Jovian; he
introduced Many Laws which he carried out in his Government*.

<span id="iii.xi.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.iii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the decease of Julian, the
government of the empire was, by the unanimous consent of the troops,
tendered to Jovian. <span id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430) When the
army was about to proclaim him emperor, he announced himself to be a
Christian and refused the sovereignty, nor would he receive the symbols
of empire; but when the soldiers discovered the cause of his refusal,
they loudly proclaimed that they were themselves Christians.

<span id="iii.xi.iii-p4"></span>The dangerous and disturbed condition in
which affairs had been left by Julian’s strategy, and the sufferings of
the army from famine in an enemy’s country, compelled Jovian to conclude
a peace with the Persians, and to cede to them some territories which
had been formerly tributary to the Romans. Having learned from
experience that the impiety of his predecessor <span id="page_348">p.
348</span> <span id="iii.xi.iii-Page_348"></span>had excited the wrath
of God, and given rise to public calamities, he wrote without delay to
the governors of the provinces, directing that the people should
assemble together without fear in the churches, that they should serve
God with reverence, and that they should receive the Christian faith as
the only true religion. He restored to the churches and the clergy, to
the widows and the virgins, the same immunities and every former
dotation for the advantage and honor of religion, which had been granted
by Constantine and his sons, and afterwards withdrawn by Julian. He
commanded Secundus, <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431) who was
then a prætorian prefect, to constitute it a capital crime to marry any
of the holy virgins, or even to regard them with unchaste desires and to
carry them off.

<span id="iii.xi.iii-p6"></span>He enacted this law <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432) on account of the wickedness which
had prevailed during the reign of Julian; for many had taken wives from
among the holy virgins, and, either by force or guile, had completely
corrupted them; and thence had proceeded that indulgence of disgraceful
lusts with impunity, which always occur when religion is abused.
