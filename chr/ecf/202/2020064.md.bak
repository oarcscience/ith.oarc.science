<span id="ii.v.xiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*The Arians remove Gregory
from the See of Alexandria, and appoint George in his Place.* <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md)

<span id="ii.v.xiv-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xiv-p3.1"></span>About</span> the same time the Arians ejected
Gregory from the see of Alexandria, on the ground that he was unpopular
and at the same time because he had set a church <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) on fire, and did not manifest
sufficient zeal in promoting the interests of their party. <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) They therefore inducted George into
his see, who was a native of Cappadocia, and had acquired the reputation
of being an able advocate of their tenets.

<span id="ii.v.xiv-p2"></span>There is an error here, repeated also by
Sozomen (III. 7), but corrected by Theodoret, *H. E.* II. 4 and 12,
without the mention of the names of his predecessors. The error consists
in the statement that Gregory was ejected at this time. It appears that
he remained in his position until the Council of Sardica, by which he
was deposed and excommunicated. He survived this council by six months.

<span id="ii.v.xiv-p5"></span>This is the same Gregory that is mentioned
in ch. 10 as violently put into possession of the see of Alexandria by
the Arians. It is evident that they were disappointed in him.
