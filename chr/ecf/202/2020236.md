<span id="ii.x.xix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*Of Palladius the
Courier.*

<span id="ii.x.xix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xix-p2.1"></span>How</span> the Emperor Theodosius received
intelligence of what was done in an incredibly short space of time, and
how he was quickly informed of events taking place far away, I shall
attempt to explain. For he had the good fortune to possess among his
subjects a man endowed with extraordinary energy both of body and mind,
named Palladius; who rode so vigorously that he would reach the
frontiers of the Roman and Persian dominions in three days, <span
id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md) and again return to Constantinople in
as many more. The same individual traversed other parts of the world on
missions from the emperor with equal celerity: so that an eloquent man
once said not unaptly, ‘This man by his speed proves the vast expanse of
the Roman Empire to be little.’ The king of the Persians himself was
astonished at the expeditious feats which were related to him of this
courier: but we must be content with the above details concerning him.

<span id="ii.x.xix-p3"></span>Much, of course, depends, in estimating
the rate of speed here recorded, on the exact distance between
Constantinople and the rather indefinite limits of the Persian empire.
But even if the minimum of 500 miles be taken as a basis, the speed
seems almost incredible.
