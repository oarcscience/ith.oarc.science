<span id="iii.xi.xxxix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX</span>.—*Peter, having
returned from Rome, regains the Churches of Egypt, after Lucius had
given way; Expedition of Valens into the West against the Scythians*.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxix-p2.1"></span>Those</span> in every city who maintained
the Nicene doctrine now began to take courage, and more particularly the
inhabitants of Alexandria in Egypt. Peter <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) had returned thither from Rome with
a letter from Damasus, confirmatory of the tenets of Nicæa and of his
own ordination; and he was installed in the government of the churches
in the place of Lucius, who sailed away to Constantinople after his
eviction. The Emperor Valens very naturally was so distracted by other
affairs, that he had no leisure to attend to these transactions. He had
no sooner arrived at Constantinople than he incurred the suspicion and
hatred of the people. The barbarians were pillaging Thrace, and were
even advancing to the very suburbs, and attempted to make an assault on
the very walls, with no one to hinder them. The city was indignant at
this inertness; and the people even charged the emperor with being a
party to their attack, because he did not sally forth, but delayed
offering battle. At length, when he was present at the sports of the
Hippodrome, the people openly and loudly accused him of neglecting the
affairs of the state, and demanded arms that they might fight in their
own defense. Valens, offended at these reproaches, immediately undertook
an expedition against the barbarians; but he threatened to punish the
insolence of the people on his return, and also to take vengeance on
them for having formerly supported the tyrant Procopius.
