<span id="iii.xiii.xxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Arsacius elected
to succeed John. The Evils wrought against the Followers of John. St.
Nicarete*.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Arsacius</span>, brother of Nectarius,
who had administered the bishopric before John, was, not long
afterwards, ordained as bishop of Constantinople. <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) He was of a very mild disposition,
and possessed of great piety; but the reputation he had acquired as a
presbyter was diminished <span id="page_414">p. 414</span> <span
id="iii.xiii.xxiii-Page_414"></span>by the conduct of some of the clergy
to whom he delegated his power, and who did what they pleased in his
name; for their evil deeds were imputed to him. Nothing, however,
operated so much to his disadvantage as the persecution that was carried
on against the followers of John. They refused to hold communion, or
even to join in prayer with him, because the enemies of John were
associated with him; and as they persisted, as we have before stated, in
holding a church in the further parts of the city, he complained to the
emperor of their conduct. The tribune was commanded to attack them with
a body of soldiers, and by means of clubs and stones he soon dispersed
them. The most distinguished among them in point of rank, and those who
were most zealous in their adherence to John, were cast into prison. The
soldiers as is usual on such occasions, went beyond their orders, and
forcibly stripped the women of their ornaments, and carried off as booty
their chains, their golden girdles, necklaces, and their collars of
rings; they pulled off the lobes of the ear with the earrings. Although
the whole city was thus filled with trouble and lamentation, the
affection of the people for John still remained the same, and they
refrained from appearing in public. Many of them absented themselves
from the market-place and public baths, while others, not considering
themselves safe in their own houses, fled the city.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxiii-p4"></span>Among the zealous men and excellent
women who adopted this latter measure was Nicarete, a lady of Bithynia.
She belonged to a noted family of the nobility, and was celebrated on
account of her perpetual virginity and her virtuous life. She was the
most modest of all the zealous women that we have ever known, and was
well ordered in manner and speech and in behavior, and throughout her
life she invariably preferred the service of God to all earthly
considerations. She showed herself capable of enduring with courage and
thought the sudden reversals of adverse affairs; she saw herself
unjustly despoiled of the greater part of her ample patrimony without
manifesting any indignation, and managed the little that remained to her
with so much economy, that although she was advanced in age, she
contrived to supply all the wants of her household, and to contribute
largely to others. Since she loved a humane spirit, she also prepared a
variety of remedies for the needs of the sick poor, and she frequently
succeeded in curing patients who had derived no benefit from the skill
of the customary physicians. With a devout strength which assisted her
in reaching the best results, she closed her lips. To sum up all in a
few words, we have never known a devoted woman endowed with such
manners, gravity, and every other virtue. Although she was so
extraordinary, she concealed the greater part of her nature and deeds;
for by modesty of character and philosophy she was always studious of
concealment. She would not accept of the office of deaconess, nor of
instructress of the virgins consecrated to the service of the Church,
because she accounted herself unworthy, although the honor was
frequently pressed upon her by John.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxiii-p5"></span>After the popular insurrection had
been quelled, the prefect of the city appeared in public, as if to
inquire into the cause of the conflagration, and the burning of the
council-hall, and punished many severely; but being a pagan, he
ridiculed the calamities of the Church, and delighted in its
misfortunes.
