<span id="iii.xiii.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Rapid Promotion of
John to the Bishopric, and more Vehement Grappling with its Affairs. He
re-establishes Discipline in the Churches everywhere. By sending an
Embassy to Rome, he abolished the Hostility to Flavian*.

<span id="iii.xiii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.iii-p2.1"></span>As</span> soon as John was raised to the
episcopal dignity, he devoted his attention first to the reformation of
the lives of his clergy; <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) he
reproved and amended their ways and diet and every procedure of their
manifold transactions. He also ejected some of the clergy from the
Church. He was naturally disposed to reprehend the misconduct of others,
and to antagonize righteously those who acted unjustly; and he gave way
to these characteristics still more in the episcopate; for his nature,
having attained power, led his tongue to reproof, and nerved his wrath
more readily against the enemy. He did not confine his efforts to the
reformation of his own church; but as a good and large-minded man, he
sought to rectify abuses throughout the world. Immediately upon entering
the episcopate, he strove to put an end to the dissension which had
arisen concerning Paulinus, between the Western and Egyptian bishops and
the bishops of the East; since on this account a general disunion was
overpowering the churches in the whole empire. He requested the
assistance of Theophilus in effecting the reconciliation of Flavian with
the bishop of Rome. <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md)
Theophilus agreed to co-operate with him in the restoration of concord;
and Acacius, bishop of Berea, and Isidore, whom Theophilus had proposed
as a candidate for ordination instead of John, were sent on an embassy
to Rome. They soon effected the object of their journey, and sailed back
to Egypt. Acacius repaired to Syria, bearing con<span id="page_401">p.
401</span> <span id="iii.xiii.iii-Page_401"></span>ciliatory letters to
the adherents of Flavian from the priests of Egypt and of the West. And
the churches, after a long delay once more laid aside their discord, and
took up communion with one another. The people at Antioch, who were
called Eustathians, continued, indeed, for some time to hold separate
assemblies, although they possessed no bishop. Evagrius, the successor
of Paulinus, did not, as we have stated, long survive him; and I think
reconciliation became easier for the bishops from there being no one to
oppose. The laity, as is customary with the populace, gradually went
over to those who assembled together under the guidance of Flavian; and
thus, in course of time, they were more and more united.
