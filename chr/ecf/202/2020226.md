id="ii.x.ix-p2.1"></span>During</span> this period upon the death of
Flavian <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) Porphyry received the
episcopate of Antioch, and after him Alexander <span
id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928) was set over that church. But at Rome,
Damasus having held that bishopric eighteen years Siricius succeeded
him; <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929) and Siricius having
