id="iii.viii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*Epistle written by
the Synod of Jerusalem in Favor of Athanasius*.

<span id="iii.viii.xxii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xxii-p2.1"></span>The</span> holy Synod assembled at
Jerusalem, to the presbyters, deacons, and people of Egypt, Libya, and
Alexandria, our beloved and most cherished brethren, greeting in the
Lord. <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277)

<span id="iii.viii.xxii-p4"></span><span id="page_300">p. 300</span>
<span id="iii.viii.xxii-Page_300"></span>“We can never, O beloved,
return adequate thanks to God, the Creator of all things, for the
wonderful works he has now accomplished, particularly for the blessings
He has conferred on your churches by the restoration of Athanasius, your
shepherd and lord, and our fellow-minister. Who could have hoped to have
ever seen this with his eyes, which now you are realizing in deed? But
truly your prayers have been heard by the God of the universe who is
concerned for His Church, and who has regarded your tears and complaint,
and on this account has heard your requests. For you were scattered
abroad and rent like sheep without a pastor. Therefore, the true
Shepherd, who from heaven watched over you, and who is concerned for His
own sheep, has restored to you him whom you desired. Behold, we do all
things for the peace of the Church, and are influenced by love like
yours. Therefore we received and embraced your pastor, and, having held
communion with you through him, we dispatch this address and our
eucharistic prayers that you may know how we are united by the bond of
love to him and you. It is right that you should pray for the piety of
the emperors most beloved of God, who having recognized your desire
about him and his purity determined to restore him to you with every
honor. Receive him, then, with uplifted hands, and be zealous to send
aloft the requisite eucharistic prayers in his behalf to the God who has
conferred these benefits upon you; and may you ever rejoice with God,
and glorify the Lord in Christ Jesus our Lord, by whom be glory to the
Father throughout all ages. Amen.”
