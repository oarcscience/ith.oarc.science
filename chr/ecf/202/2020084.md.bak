<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV</span>.—*Of Gallus Cæsar.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Gallus</span>, having accomplished these
things, was unable to bear his success with moderation; but forthwith
attempted innovations against the authority of him who had constituted
him Cæsar, himself aspiring to the sovereign power. His purpose was,
however, soon detected by Constantius: for he had dared to put to death,
on his own responsibility, Domitian, at that time Prætorian prefect of
the East, and Magnus the quæstor, not having disclosed his designs to
the emperor. Constantius, extremely incensed at this conduct, summoned
Gallus to his presence, who being in great terror went very reluctantly;
and when he arrived in the western parts, and had reached the island of
Flanona, Constantius ordered him to be slain. But not long after he
created Julian, the brother of Gallus, Cæsar, and sent him against the
barbarians in Gaul. It was in the seventh consulate <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) of the emperor Constantius that
Gallus, who was surnamed Constantius, was slain, when he himself was a
third time consul: and Julian was created Cæsar on the 6th of November
in the following year, when Arbetion <span
id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) and Lollian were consuls; of him we
shall make farther mention in the next book. <span
id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) When Constantius was thus relieved
from the disquietudes which had occupied him, his attention was again
directed to ecclesiastical contentions. Going therefore from Sirmium to
the imperial city Rome, he again appointed a synod of bishops, summoning
some of the eastern prelates to hasten into Italy, <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) and arranging for those of the west to
meet them there. While preparations were making in the east for this
purpose, Julius bishop of Rome died, after having presided over the
church in that place fifteen years, and was succeeded in the episcopal
dignity by Liberius.
