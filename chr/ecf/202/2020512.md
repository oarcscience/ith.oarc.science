id="iii.xiii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Since these Ills
existed in the Church, Secular Affairs also fell into Disorder. The
Affairs of Stilicho, the General of Honorius*.

<span id="iii.xiii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xxv-p2.1"></span>About</span> this period <span
id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) the dissensions by which the Church
was agitated were followed, as is frequently the case, by disturbances
and commotions in the state. The Huns crossed the Ister and devastated
Thrace. The robbers in Isauria gathered in great numbers and ravaged
cities and villages as far as Caria and Phœnicia. Stilicho, the general
of Honorius, a man who had attained great power, if any one ever did,
and had under his sway the flower of the Roman and of the barbarian
soldiery, conceived feelings of enmity against the rulers who held
office under Arcadius, and determined to set the two empires at enmity
with each other. He caused Alaric, the leader of the Goths, to be
appointed by Honorius to the office of general of the Roman troops, and
sent him into Illyria; whither also he dispatched Jovius, the prætorian
prefect, and promised to join them there with the Roman soldiers in
order to add that province to the dominions of Honorius. Alaric marched
at the head of his troops from the barbarous regions bordering on
Dalmatia and Pannonia, and came to Epirus; and after waiting for some
time there, he returned to Italy. Stilicho was prevented from fulfilling
his agreement to join Alaric, by some letters which were transmitted to
him from Honorius. These events happened in the manner narrated.
