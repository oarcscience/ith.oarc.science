<span id="ii.viii.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Of the
Hieroglyphics found in the Temple of Serapis.*

<span id="ii.viii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xviii-p2.1"></span>When</span> the Temple of Serapis was
torn down and laid bare, there were found in it, engraven on stones,
certain characters which they call hieroglyphics, having the forms of
crosses. <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740) Both the Christians and
pagans on seeing them, appropriated and applied them to their respective
religions: for the Christians who affirm that the cross is the sign of
Christ’s saving passion, <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span
id="ii.viii.xviii-Page_127"></span>claimed this character as peculiarly
theirs; but the pagans alleged that it might appertain to Christ and
Serapis in common; ‘for,’ said they, ‘it symbolizes one thing to
Christians and another to heathens.’ Whilst this point was controverted
amongst them, some of the heathen converts to Christianity, who were
conversant with these hieroglyphic characters, interpreted the form of a
cross and said that it signifies ‘Life to come.’ This the Christians
exultingly laid hold of, as decidedly favorable to their religion. But
after other hieroglyphics had been deciphered containing a prediction
that ‘When the cross should appear,’—for this was ‘life to come,’—‘the
Temple of Serapis would be destroyed,’ a very great number of the pagans
embraced Christianity, and confessing their sins, were baptized. Such
are the reports I have heard respecting the discovery of this symbol in
form of a cross. But I cannot imagine that the Egyptian priests foreknew
the things concerning Christ, when they engraved the figure of a cross.
For if ‘the advent’ of our Saviour into the world ‘was a mystery hid
from ages and from generations,’ <span id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741)
as the apostle declares; and if the devil himself, the prince of
wickedness, knew nothing of it, his ministers, the Egyptian priests, are
likely to have been still more ignorant of the matter; but Providence
doubtless purposed that in the enquiry concerning this character, there
should something take place analogous to what happened heretofore at the
preaching of Paul. For he, made wise by the Divine Spirit, employed a
similar method in relation to the Athenians, <span
id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742) and brought over many of them to the
faith, when on reading the inscription on one of their altars, he
accommodated and applied it to his own discourse. Unless indeed any one
should say, that the Word of God wrought in the Egyptian priests, as it
did on Balaam <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743) and
Caiaphas; <span id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744) for these men uttered
prophecies of good things in spite of themselves. This will suffice on
the subject.

<span id="ii.viii.xviii-p3"></span>There are several cruciform signs
among the Egyptian hieroglyphics, as e.g. the simple determinative 5,
meaning ‘to cross,’ ‘to multiply,’ ‘to mix’ (see Birch, *Egyptian
Texts,* p. 99); or the syllabic \*, phonetically equivalent to *am* (see
Birch, *ibid.* p. 101); or the cross with a ring at the head \*; or the
still more elaborate \* (see Brugsh, *Thesaurus Inscript. Egyptiacarum,*
p. 20; also Champollion, *Grammaire Egyptienne,* XII. p. 365, 440). To
which of these Socrates refers it is impossible to say from their mere
form. They occur commonly and we must infer that the discovery described
in this passage is not the first bringing into light of the sign
mentioned, but its occurrence in the Serapeum. The third of the above
signs is usually interpreted as ‘life’ either ‘happy’ or ‘immortal,’
which agrees with the meaning given to the cruciform sign here
mentioned.
