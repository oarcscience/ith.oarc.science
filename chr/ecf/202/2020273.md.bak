<span id="iii.iii-p4"></span> ————————————

<span id="iii.iii-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.iii-p5.1"></span>Hermias Sozomen</span> practiced the law at
Constantinople, at the same time with Socrates. His ancestors were not
mean; they were originally natives of Palestine, being inhabitants of a
village near Gaza, called Bethelia. This village was very populous in
times past, and had most stately and ancient churches. But the most
glorious structure of them all was the Pantheon, situated on an
artificial hill, which was the tower as it were of Bethelia, as Sozomen
relates in chap. xv. of his fifth book. The grandfather of Hermias
Sozomen was born in that village, and first converted to the Christian
faith by Hilarion the monk. For when Alaphion, an inhabitant of the same
village, was possessed with a devil, and the Jews and physicians,
attempting to cure him, could do him no good by their enchantments,
Hilarion, by a bare invocation of the name of God, cast out the devil.
Sozomen’s grandfather, and Alaphion himself, amazed at this miracle,
with their whole families embraced the Christian religion. The
grandfather of Sozomen was eminent for his expositions of the Sacred
Scriptures, being a person endowed with a polite wit, and an acuteness
of understanding; and besides, he was well skilled in literature.
Therefore he was highly esteemed by the Christians inhabiting Gaza,
Ascalon, and the places adjacent, as being useful and necessary for the
propagating of religion, and could easily unloose the knots of the
Sacred Scriptures. But Alaphion’s descendants excelled others in their
sanctity of life, in kindness to the indigent, and in other virtues; and
they were the first that built churches and monasteries there, as
Sozomen says in the passage above cited, where he also adds, that some
holy persons of Alaphion’s family were surviving even in his own days,
with whom he himself conversed when very young, and concerning whom he
promises to speak more afterwards. Most probably he means Salamanes,
Phusco, Malchio, and Crispio, brothers, concerning whom he speaks in
chap. xxxii. of his sixth book. For he there says that these brethren,
instructed in the monastic discipline by Hilarion, were, during the
empire of Valens, eminent in the monasteries of Palestine; that they
lived near Bethelia, a village in the country of the Gazites, and were
descendants of a noble family in those parts. He mentions the same
persons in the fifteenth chapter of book viii., where he says that
Crispio was Epiphanius’s archdeacon. It is evident, therefore, that the
brothers were of Alaphion’s family. Alaphion, too, was related to
Sozomen’s grandfather, as we may conjecture; first, because the
grandfather of Sozomen is said to have been converted (together with his
whole family) to the Christian religion, upon account of Alaphion’s
wonderful cure, whom Hilarion had healed by calling on the name of
Almighty God. Secondly, this conjecture is confirmed by what Sozomen
relates, viz., that when he was very young, he conversed familiarly with
the aged monks that were of Alaphion’s family. And, lastly, from the
fact that Sozomen took his name from those persons who were either the
sons or grandchildren of Alaphion. For he was called Salamanes Hermias
Sozomenus (as Photius declares in his Bibliotheca), from the name of
that Salamanes who, as we observed before, was the brother of Phusco,
Malchio, and Crispio. Wherefore Nicephorus, and others, are mistaken in
supposing that Sozomen had the surname of Salaminius because he was born
at Salamis, a city of Cyprus. But we have before shown from Sozomen’s
own testimony, that he was not born in Cyprus, but in Palestine. For his
grandfather was not only a Palestinian, as is above said, but Sozomen
himself was also educated in Palestine, in the bosom (so to say) of
those monks who were of Alaphion’s family. From this education Sozomen
seems to have imbibed that most ardent love of a monastic life and
discipline, which he declares in so many places of his history. Hence it
is, that in his books he is not content to relate who were the fathers
and founders of monastic philosophy; but he also carefully relates their
successors and disciples, who followed this way of life both in Egypt,
Syria, and Palestine, and also in Pontus, Armenia, and Osdroëna. Hence
also it is, that in the twelfth chapter of the first book of his
history, he has proposed to be read (in the beginning as it were) that
gorgeous account of the monastic philosophy. For he supposed that he
should have been ungrateful, had he not after this manner at least made
a return of thanks to those in whose familiarity he had lived, and from
whom, when he was a youth, he had received such eminent examples of a
good conversation, as he himself intimates, in the opening of <span
id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span id="iii.iii-Page_234"></span>his first
book. It is inferred that Sozomen was educated at Gaza, not only from
the passage above mentioned, but also from chap. xxviii. of his seventh
book, where Sozomen says that he himself had seen Zeno, bishop of
Majuma, for this Majuma is a sea-port belonging to the Gazites. Although
Zeno was nearly a hundred years old, he was never absent from the
morning and evening hymns, unless sickness detained him. After this
Sozomen applied himself to the profession of the law. He was a student
of the civil law at Berytus, a city of Phœnicia, not far distant from
his own country, where there was a famous school of civil law. But he
practiced the law at Constantinople, as himself asserts, book ii. chap.
iii. And yet he seems not to have been very much employed in pleading of
causes; for at the same time that he was an advocate in Constantinople,
he wrote his Ecclesiastical History; as may be concluded from his own
words in the last-mentioned passage. Before he wrote his nine books of
Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen composed a Breviary of Ecclesiastical
Affairs, from our Saviour’s ascension to the deposition of Licinius.
This work was comprised in two books, as himself bears witness in the
opening of his first book; but these two books are now lost.

<span id="iii.iii-p6"></span>In the composure of his History, Sozomen
has made use of a style neither too low nor too high, but one between
both, as is most agreeable to a writer of ecclesiastical affairs.
Photius prefers Sozomen’s style to that of Socrates, and we agree with
him in his criticism. But though Sozomen is superior in the elegance of
his expression, yet Socrates excels him in judgment. For Socrates judges
incomparably well, both of men, and also of ecclesiastical business and
affairs; and there is nothing in his works but what is grave and
serious, nothing that can be expunged as superfluous. But on the
contrary, some passages occur in Sozomen that are trivial and childish.
Of this sort is his digression in his first book concerning the building
of the city Hemona, and concerning the Argonauts, who carried the ship
Argo on their shoulders some furlongs, and also his description of
Daphne without the walls of the city Antioch, in chap. xix. of his sixth
book; to which we must add that observation of his, concerning the
beauty of the body, where he treats of that virgin at whose house the
blessed Athanasius was concealed a long while. Lastly, his ninth book
contains little else besides warlike events, which ought to have no
place in an Ecclesiastical History. Sozomen’s style, however, is not
without its faults. For the periods of his sentences are only joined
together by the particles <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii-p6.1"></span>δὲ</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii-p6.2"></span>τέ</span>, than which there is nothing more
troublesome. Should any one attentively read the epistle in which
Sozomen dedicates his work to Theodosius junior, he will find it true
that Sozomen was no great orator.

<span id="iii.iii-p7"></span>It remains, that we inquire which of these
two authors, Socrates or Sozomen, wrote first, and which of them
borrowed, or rather stole, from the other. Certainly, since both of them
wrote almost the same things of the same transactions, inasmuch as they
both began at the same beginning, and concluded their history at the
same point (both beginning from the reign of Constantine, and ending at
the seventeenth consulate of Theodosius junior), it must needs be true,
that one of them robbed the other’s desk. This sort of theft was
committed by many of the Grecian writers, as Porphyry testifies,
Eusebius’ Præparatio Evangelica, bk. x. But which was the plagiary,
Socrates or Sozomen, it is hard to say, in regard both of them lived in
the same times, and both wrote their history in the empire of Theodosius
junior. Therefore, in the disquisition of this question, we must make
use of conjecture. So Porphyry in the above-mentioned book, since it was
uncertain whether Hyperides had stolen from Demosthenes, or Demosthenes
from Hyperides, because both had lived in the same time, decided to use
conjecture. Let us therefore see upon which of them falls the suspicion
of theft. Indeed, this is my sentiment, I suppose that the inferior does
frequently steal from the superior, and the junior from the senior. But
Sozomen is in my judgment far inferior to Socrates; and he betook
himself to writing his history when he was younger than Socrates. For he
wrote it whilst he was yet an advocate, as I observed before. Now, the
profession of the advocates amongst the Romans was not perpetual, but
temporary. Lastly, he that adds something to the other, and sometimes
amends the other, seems to have written last. But Sozomen now and then
adds some passages to Socrates, and in some places dissents from him, as
Photius has observed, and we have hinted in our annotations. Sozomen
therefore seems to have written last. And this is the opinion of almost
all modern writers, who place Socrates before Sozomen. So Bellarmine in
his book “De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis”; who is followed by Miræus,
Labbæus, and Vossius. Amongst the ancients, Cassiodorus, Photius, and
Nicephorus name Socrates in the first place. Although Cassiodorus is
found to have varied; for in the preface of the Tripartite History, he
inverts the order, and names Theodoret first, ranks Sozomen in the
second place, and refers to Socrates as the last. So also Theodorus
Lector recounts them in his epistle which he prefixed to his Tripartite
History. Thus far concerning Sozomen.
