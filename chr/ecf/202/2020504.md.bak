<span id="iii.xiii.xvii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Council held by
Theophilus and the Accusers of John in Rufinianæ. John is summoned to
attend, and not being present, was deposed by Them*.

<span id="iii.xiii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xvii-p2.1"></span>When</span> Theophilus entered
Constantinople, none of the clergy went out to meet him; for his enmity
against the bishop had become publicly known. <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) Some sailors from Alexandria,
however, who chanced to be on the shore, both from the corn vessels as
well as other ships, having collected together, received him with great
acclamations of joy. Passing by the church, he proceeded directly to the
palace, where a lodging had been prepared for his accommodation. He soon
perceived that many people <span id="page_410">p. 410</span> <span
id="iii.xiii.xvii-Page_410"></span>of the city were strongly prejudiced
against John, and ready to bring accusations against him; and taking his
measures accordingly, he repaired to a place called “The Oak,” in the
suburbs of Chalcedon. This place now bears the name of Rufinus; for he
was a consul, and erected here a magnificent palace, and a great church
in honor of the apostles, Peter and Paul, and therefore named it the
Apostolium; and appointed a congregation of monks to perform the
clerical duties in the church. When Theophilus and the other bishops met
for deliberation in this place, he judged it expedient to make no
further allusion to the works of Origen, and called the monks of Scetis
to repentance, promising that there would be no recollection of wrongs
nor infliction of evil. His partisans zealously seconded his efforts,
and told them that they must ask Theophilus to pardon their conduct; and
as all the members of the assembly concurred in this request, the monks
were troubled, and believing that it was necessary to do what they were
desired by so many bishops, they used the words which it was their
custom to use even when injured, and said “spare us.” Theophilus
willingly received them into favor, and restored them to communion; and
the question concerning the injuries done to the monks of Scetis was
ended. I feel convinced that this matter would not have been so quickly
settled, had Dioscorus and Ammonius been present with the other monks.
But Dioscorus had died some time previously, and had been interred in
the church dedicated to St. Mocius the martyr. Ammonius, also, had been
taken ill at the very time that preparations were being made for the
convocation of the council; and although he insisted upon repairing to
“The Oak,” yet his malady was thereby greatly increased: he died soon
after his journey, and had a splendid entombment among the monks of that
vicinity, and there he lies. Theophilus, it is said, shed tears on
hearing of his death, and declared that although he had been the cause
of much perplexity, there was not a monk to be found of more exalted
character than Ammonius. It must, however, be admitted, that the death
of this monk tended much to promote the success of the designs of
Theophilus.

<span id="iii.xiii.xvii-p4"></span>The members of the council summoned
all the clergy of Constantinople to appear before them, and threatened
to depose those who did not obey the summons. They cited John to appear
and answer; as likewise Serapion, Tigrius a presbyter, and Paul a
reader. John acquainted them, through the medium of Demetrius, bishop of
Pisinus, and of some of the other clergy, who were his friends, that he
would not avoid investigation, but that he was ready, if the names of
his accusers and the subject of his accusations were made known to him,
to justify his proceedings before a larger council; for he did not
choose to be considered insane, and to recognize his manifest enemies as
judges. The bishops testified so much indignation at the non-compliance
of John, that some of the clergy whom he had sent to the council were
intimidated and did not return to him. Demetrius, and those who
preferred his interests to all other considerations, quitted the
council, and returned to him. The same day, a courier and a shorthand
writer were dispatched from the palace to command John to repair to the
bishops, and to urge the bishops to decide his cause without further
delay. After John had been cited four times, and had appealed to a
general council, no other accusation could be substantiated against him,
except his refusal to obey the summons of the council; and upon this
ground they deposed him.
