<span id="ii.x.xvii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Miracle performed by
Paul Bishop of the Novatians at the Baptism of a Jewish Impostor.*

<span id="ii.x.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xvii-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time Chrysanthus bishop of
the Novatians, after presiding over the churches of his own sect seven
years, died on the 26th of August, under the consulate of Monaxius and
Plintha. <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) He was succeeded in the
bishopric by Paul, who had formerly been a teacher of the Latin
language: but afterwards, setting aside the Latin language, had devoted
himself to an ascetic course of life; and having founded a monastery of
religious men, he adopted a mode of living not very different from that
pursued by the monks in the desert. In fact I myself found him just such
a person as Evagrius <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md) says the
monks dwelling in the deserts ought to be; imitating them in continued
fastings, silence, abstinence from animal food, and for the most part
abstaining also from the use of oil and wine. He was, moreover,
solicitous about the wants of the poor to as great an extent as any
other man; he untiringly visited those who were in prison, and in behalf
of many criminals interceded with the judges, who readily attended to
him on account of his eminent piety. But why should I lengthen my
account of him? For I am about to mention a deed done by him which is
well worthy of being recorded in writing. A certain Jewish impostor,
pretending to be a convert to Christianity, was in the habit of being
baptized often <span id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) and by that
artifice he amassed a good deal of money. After having deceived many of
the Christian sects by this fraud—for he received baptism from the
Arians and Macedonians—as there remained no others to practise his
hypocrisy upon, he at length came to Paul bishop of the Novatians, and
declaring that he earnestly desired baptism, requested that he might
obtain it at his hand. Paul commended the determination of the Jew, but
told him he could not perform that rite for him, until he had been
instructed in the fundamental principles of the faith, and given himself
to fasting and prayer for many days. <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) The Jew compelled to fast against his
will became the more importunate in his request for baptism; now as Paul
did not wish to discourage him by longer delays, since he was so urgent,
consented to grant his request, and made all the necessary preparations
for the baptism. Having purchased a white vestment for him, he ordered
the font to be filled with water, and then led the Jew to it in order to
baptize him. But a certain invisible power of God caused the water
suddenly to disappear. The bishop, of course, and those present, had not
the least suspicion of the real cause, but imagined that the water had
escaped by the channels underneath, by means of which they are
accustomed to empty the font; these passages were therefore very
carefully closed, and the font filled again. Again, however, as the Jew
was taken there a second time, the water vanished as before. Then Paul
addressing the Jew, said, ‘Either you are an evil-doer, wretched man, or
an ignorant person who has already been baptized.’ The people having
crowded together to witness this miracle, one among them recognized the
Jew, and identified him as having been baptized by Atticus, the bishop,
a little while before. Such was the portent wrought by the hands of Paul
bishop of the Novatians.
