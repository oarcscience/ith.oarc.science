<span id="iii.vi.xvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*Constantine, having
heard of the Strife of the Bishops, and the Difference of Opinion
concerning the Passover, is greatly troubled and sends Hosius, a
Spaniard, Bishop of Cordova, to Alexandria, to abolish the Dissension
among the Bishops, and to settle the Dispute about the Passover*.

<span id="iii.vi.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xvi-p2.1"></span>After</span> there had been many synods held
in Egypt, and the contest had still continued to increase in violence,
the report of the dissension reached the palace, and Constantine was
thereby greatly troubled; for just at this period, when religion was
beginning to be more generally propagated, many were deterred by the
difference in doctrines from embracing Christianity. The emperor <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) openly charged Arius and Alexander
with having originated this disturbance, and wrote to rebuke them for
having made a controversy public which it was in their power to have
concealed, and for having contentiously agitated a question which ought
never to have been mooted, or upon which, at least, their opinion ought
to have been given quietly. He told them that they ought not to have
separated from others on account of difference of sentiment concerning
certain points of doctrine.

<span id="iii.vi.xvi-p4"></span>For concerning the Divine Providence men
ought necessarily to hold one and the same belief; but the minute
researches in this province, especially if they do not bring them to the
one opinion, must be retained in secret according to all reason. He
exhorted them to put away all loose talk about such points, and to be of
one mind; for he had been not a little grieved, and on this account he
had renounced his intention of visiting the cities of the East. It was
in this strain that he wrote to Alexander and to Arius, reproving and
exhorting them both.

<span id="iii.vi.xvi-p5"></span>Constantine was also deeply grieved at
the diversity of opinion which prevailed concerning the celebration of
the Passover; <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) for some of the
cities in the East differed on this point, although they did not
withhold from communion with one another; they kept the festival more
according to the manner of the Jews, <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) and as was natural by this
divergence, detracted from the splendor of the festal sacrifice. The
emperor zealously endeavored to remove both these causes of dissension
from the church; and thinking to be able to remove the evil before it
advanced to greater proportions, he sent one who was honored for his
faith, his virtuous life, and most approved in those former times for
his <span id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span
id="iii.vi.xvi-Page_253"></span>confessions about this doctrine, to
reconcile those who were divided on account of doctrine in Egypt, and
those who in the East differed about the Passover. This man was Hosius,
bishop of Cordova.
