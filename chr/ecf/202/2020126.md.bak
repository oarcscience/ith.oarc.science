<span id="ii.vii.i-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*After Jovian’s Death,
Valentinian is proclaimed Emperor, and takes his Brother Valens as
Colleague in the Empire; Valentinian holds the Orthodox Faith, but
Valens is an Arian.*

<span id="ii.vii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.i-p3.1"></span>The</span> Emperor Jovian having died, as we
have said, at Dadastana, in his own consulate and that of Varronian his
son on the 17th of February, the army leaving Galatia arrived at Nicæa
in Bithynia in seven days’ march, and there unanimously proclaimed
Valentinian emperor, on the 25th of February, in the same consulate. He
was a Pannonian by race, a native of the city of Cibalis, and being
entrusted with a military command, had displayed great skill in tactics.
He was moreover endowed with such greatness of mind, that he always
appeared superior to any degree of honor he might have attained. As soon
as they had created him emperor, he proceeded forthwith to
Constantinople; and thirty days after his own possession of the imperial
dignity, he made his brother Valens his colleague in the empire. They
both professed Christianity, but did not hold the same Christian creed:
for Valentinian respected the Nicene Creed; but Valens was prepossessed
in favor of the Arian opinions. And this prejudice was caused by his
having been baptized by Eudoxius bishop of Constantinople. Each of them
was zealous for the views of his own party; but when they had attained
sovereign power, they manifested very different dispositions. For
previously in the reign of Julian, when Valentinian was a military
tribune, and Valens held a command in the emperor’s guards, they both
proved their zeal for the faith; for being constrained to sacrifice,
they chose rather to give up their military rank than to do so and
renounce Christianity. <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) Julian,
however, knowing the necessity of the men to the state, retained them in
their respective places, as did also Jovian, his successor in the
empire. Later on, being invested with imperial authority, they were in
accord in the management of public affairs, but as regards Christianity,
as I have said, they behaved themselves very differently: for
Valentinian while he favored those who agreed with him in sentiment,
offered no violence to the Arians; but Valens, in his anxiety to promote
the Arian cause, grievously disturbed those who differed from them, as
the course of our history will show. Now at that time Liberius presided
over the Roman church; and at Alexandria Athanasius was bishop of the
Homoousians, while Lucius had been constituted George’s successor by the
Arians. At Antioch Euzoïus was at the head of the Arians: but the
Homoousians were divided into two parties, of one of which Paulinus was
chief, and Melitius of the other. Cyril was again constituted over the
church at Jerusalem. The churches at Constantinople were under the
government of Eudoxius, who openly taught the dogmas of Arianism, but
the Homoousians had but one small edifice in the city wherein to hold
their assemblies. Those of the Macedonian heresy who had dissented from
the Acacians at Seleucia, then retained their churches in every city.
Such was the state of ecclesiastical affairs at that time. <span
