<span id="iii.xii.xv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*Flavian and Evagrius,
Bishops of Antioch. The Events at Alexandria upon the Destruction of the
Temple of Dionysus. The Serapeum and the other Idolatrous Temples which
were destroyed*.

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xv-p2.1"></span>Paulinus</span>, <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) bishop of Antioch, died about this
period, and those who had been convened into a church with him persisted
in their aversion to Flavian, although his religious sentiments were
precisely the same as their own, because he had violated the oath he had
formerly made to Meletius. They, therefore, elected Evagrius as their
bishop. Evagrius did not long survive this appointment, and although
Flavian prevented the election of another bishop, those who had seceded
from communion with him, still continued to hold their assemblies apart.

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p4"></span>About this period, the bishop of
Alexandria, to whom the temple of Dionysus had, at his own request, been
granted by the emperor, converted the edifice into a church. The statues
were removed, the adyta were exposed; and, in order to cast contumely on
the pagan mysteries, he made a procession for the display of these
objects; the phalli, and whatever other object had been concealed in the
adyta which really was, or seemed to be, ridiculous, he made a public
exhibition of. The pagans, amazed at so unexpected an exposure, could
not suffer it in silence, but conspired together to attack the
Christians. They killed many of the Christians, wounded others, and
seized the Serapion, a temple which was conspicuous for beauty and
vastness and which was seated on an eminence. This they converted into a
temporary citadel; and hither they conveyed many of the Christians, put
them to the torture, and compelled them to offer sacrifice. Those who
refused compliance were crucified, had both legs broken, or were put to
death in some cruel manner. When the sedition had prevailed for some
time, the rulers came and urged the people to remember the laws, to lay
down their arms, and to give up the Serapion. There came then Romanus,
the general of the military legions in Egypt; and Evagrius was the
prefect of Alexandria <span id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) As
their efforts, however, to reduce the people to submission were utterly
in vain, they made known what had transpired to the emperor. Those who
had shut themselves up in the Serapion prepared a more spirited
resistance, from fear of the punishment that they knew would await their
audacious proceedings, and they were further instigated to revolt by the
inflammatory discourses of a man named Olympius, attired in the garments
of a philosopher, who told them that they ought to die rather than
neglect the gods of their fathers. Perceiving that they were greatly
dispirited by the destruction of the idolatrous statues, he assured them
that such a circumstance did not warrant their renouncing their
religion; for that the statues were composed of corruptible materials,
and were mere pictures, and therefore would disappear; whereas, the
powers which had dwelt within them, had flown to heaven. By such
representations as these, he retained the multitude with him in the
Serapion.

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p6"></span>When the emperor was informed of these
occurrences, he declared that the Christians who had been slain were
blessed, inasmuch as they had been admitted to the honor of martyrdom,
and had suffered in defense of the faith. He offered free pardon <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) to those who had slain them, hoping
that by this act of clemency they would be the more readily induced to
embrace Christianity; and he commanded the demolition of the temples in
Alexandria which had been the cause of the popular sedition. It is said
<span id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xv-Page_386"></span>that, when this imperial edict was read
in public, the Christians uttered loud shouts of joy, because the
emperor laid the odium of what had occurred upon the pagans. The people
who were guarding the Serapion were so terrified at hearing these
shouts, that they took to flight, and the Christians immediately
obtained possession of the spot, which they have retained ever since. I
have been informed that, on the night preceding this occurrence,
Olympius heard the voice of one singing hallelujah in the Serapion. The
doors were shut and everything was still; and as he could see no one,
but could only hear the voice of the singer, he at once understood what
the sign signified; and unknown to any one he quitted the Serapion and
embarked for Italy. It is said that when the temple was being
demolished, some stones were found, on which were hieroglyphic
characters in the form of a cross, which on being submitted to the
inspection of the learned, were interpreted as signifying the life to
come. <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) These characters led to
the conversion of several of the pagans, as did likewise other
inscriptions found in the same place, and which contained predictions of
the destruction of the temple. It was thus that the Serapion was taken,
and, a little while after, converted into a church; it received the name
of the Emperor Arcadius.

<span id="iii.xii.xv-p9"></span>There were still pagans in many cities,
who contended zealously in behalf of their temples; as, for instance,
the inhabitants of Petræa and of Areopolis, in Arabia; of Raphi and
Gaza, in Palestine; of Heriopolis in Phœnicia; and of Apamea, on the
river Axius, in Syria. I have been informed that the inhabitants of the
last-named city often armed the men of Galilee and the peasants of
Lebanon in defense of their temples; and that at last, they even carried
their audacity to such a height, as to slay a bishop named Marcellus.
This bishop had commanded the demolition of all the temples in the city
and villages, under the supposition that it would not be easy otherwise
for them to be converted from their former religion. Having heard that
there was a very spacious temple at Aulon, a district of Apamea, he
repaired thither with a body of soldiers and gladiators. He stationed
himself at a distance from the scene of conflict, beyond the reach of
the arrows; for he was afflicted with the gout, and was unable to fight,
to pursue, or to flee. Whilst the soldiers and gladiators were engaged
in the assault against the temple, some pagans, discovering that he was
alone, hastened to the place where he was separated from the combat;
they arose suddenly and seized him, and burnt him alive. The
perpetrators of this deed were not then known, but, in course of time,
they were detected, and the sons of Marcellus determined upon avenging
his death. The council of the province, however, prohibited them from
executing this design, and declared that it was not just that the
relatives or friends of Marcellus should seek to avenge his death; when
they should rather return thanks to God for having accounted him worthy
to die in such a cause.
