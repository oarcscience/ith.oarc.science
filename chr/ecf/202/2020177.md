<span id="ii.viii.xiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII</span>.—*While the Emperor
Theodosius is engaged in Military Preparations against Maximus, his Son
Honorius is born. He then proceeds to Milan in Order to encounter the
Usurper.*

<span id="ii.viii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xiii-p2.1"></span>But</span> the Emperor Theodosius was
filled with great solicitude, and levied a powerful army against the
usurper, fearing lest he should meditate the assassination of the young
Valentinian also. While engaged in this preparation, an embassy arrived
from the Persians, requesting peace from the emperor. Then also the
empress Flaccilla bore him a son named Honorius, on the 9th of
September, in the consulate of Richomelius and Clearchus. <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) Under the same consulate, and a little
previously, Agelius bishop of the Novatians died. <span
id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) In the year following, wherein
Arcadius Augustus bore his first consulate in conjunction with
Baudon, <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) Timothy bishop of
Alexandria died, and was succeeded in the episcopate by Theophilus.
About a year after this, Demophilus the Arian prelate having departed
this life, the Arians sent for Marinus a leader of their own heresy out
of Thrace, to whom they entrusted the bishopric: but Marinus did not
long occupy that position, for under him that sect was divided into two
parties, as we shall hereafter explain; <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) for they invited Dorotheus <span
id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) to come to them from Antioch in Syria,
and constituted him their bishop. Meanwhile the emperor Theodosius
proceeded to the war against Maximus, leaving his son Arcadius with
imperial authority at Constantinople. Accordingly arriving at
Thessalonica he found Valentinian and those about him in great anxiety,
because through compulsion they had acknowledged the usurper as emperor.
Theodosius, however, gave no expression to his sentiments in public; he
neither rejected nor admitted <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md)
the embassy of Maximus: but unable to endure tyrannical domination over
the Roman empire, under the assumption of an imperial name, he hastily
mustered his forces and advanced to Milan, <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) whither the usurper had already gone.

<span id="ii.viii.xiii-p3"></span>384 <span class="c13"><span

empire with Arcadius, reigning in the West from 398 to 423 <span

the whole of this period comes within the time of Socrates’ history, he
does not mention Honorius but once again before his death.
