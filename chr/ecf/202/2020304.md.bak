<span id="iii.vii.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Concerning Helena, the
Mother of the Emperor; she visited Jerusalem, built Temples in that
City, and performed other Godly Works: Her Death*.

<span id="iii.vii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.ii-p2.1"></span>About</span> this period, the emperor,
having determined upon erecting a temple in honor of God, charged the
governors to see that the work was executed in the most magnificent and
costly manner possible. His mother Helena also erected two
temples, <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142.md) the one at Bethlehem
near the cave where Christ was born, the other on ridges of the Mount of
Olives, whence He was taken up to heaven. Many other acts show her piety
and religiousness, among which the following is not the least
remarkable: During her residence at Jerusalem, it is related that she
assembled the sacred virgins at a feast, ministered to them at supper,
presented them with food, poured water on their hands, and performed
other similar services customary to those who wait upon guests. When she
visited the cities of the East, she bestowed befitting gifts on the
churches in every town, enriched those individuals who had been deprived
of their possessions, supplied ungrudgingly the necessities of the poor,
and restored to liberty those who had been long imprisoned, or condemned
to exile or the mines. It seems to me that so many holy actions demanded
a recompense; and indeed, even in this life, she was raised to the
summit of magnificence and splendor; she was proclaimed Augusta; her
image was stamped on golden coins, and she was invested by her son with
authority over the imperial treasury to give it according to her
judgment. Her death, too, was glorious; for when, at the age of eighty,
she quitted this life, she left her son and her descendants (like her of
the race of Cæsar), masters of the Roman world. And if there be any
advantage in such fame—forgetfulness did not conceal her though she was
dead—the coming age has the pledge of her perpetual memory; for two
cities are named after her, the one in Bithynia, and the other in
Palestine. <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md) Such is the
history of Helena.
