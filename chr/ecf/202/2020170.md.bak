<span id="ii.viii.vi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter V</span>.—*Events at Antioch in
Connection with Paulinus and Meletius.*

<span id="ii.viii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.vi-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time a serious contest was
excited at Antioch in Syria, on account of Melitius. We have already
observed <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) that Paulinus, bishop
of that city, because of his eminent piety was not sent into exile: and
that Melitius after being restored by Julian, was again banished by
Valens, and at length recalled in Gratian’s reign. <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) On his return to Antioch, he found
Paulinus greatly enfeebled by old age; his partisans therefore
immediately used their utmost endeavors to get him associated with that
bishop in the episcopal office. And when Paulinus declared that ‘it was
contrary to the canons <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) to take
as a coadjutor one who had been ordained by the Arians,’ the people had
recourse to violence, and caused him to be consecrated in one of the
churches without the city. When this was done, a great disturbance
arose; but afterwards the people were brought to unite on the following
stipulations. Having assembled such of the clergy as might be considered
worthy candidates for the bishopric, they found them six in number, of
whom Flavian was one. All these they bound by an oath, not to use any
effort to get themselves ordained, when either <span id="page_120">p.
120</span> <span id="ii.viii.vi-Page_120"></span>of the two bishops
should die, but to permit the survivor to retain undisturbed possession
of the see of the deceased. <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) Thus
pledges were given, and the people had peace and so no longer quarreled
with one another. The Luciferians, <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) however, separated themselves from the
rest, because Melitius who had been ordained by the Arians was admitted
to the episcopate. In this state of the Antiochian church, Melitius was
under the necessity of going to Constantinople.

<span id="ii.viii.vi-p5"></span>In its eighth canon the Council of
Nicæa, looking forward to the reconciliation of such Novatians or
*Cathari* as might desire to return to the Catholic Church, enjoins that
‘when in villages or in cities there are found only clergy of their own
sect (*Cathari*), the oldest of these clerics shall remain among the
clergy, and in their position; but if a Catholic priest or bishop be
found among them, it is evident that the bishop of the Catholic Church
should preserve the episcopal dignity whilst any one who has received
the title of bishop from the so-called *Cathari* would only have a right
to the honors accorded to priests, unless the bishop thinks it right to
let him enjoy the honor of the title. If he does not desire to do so let
him give him the place of rural bishop (*chorepiscopus*) or priest, in
order that he may appear to be altogether a part of the clergy, and that
there may not be two bishops in the same city.’ Cf. Hefele, *Hist. of
the Councils*, Vol. I. p. 410; Bingham, *Christ. Antiq.* II. 13. 1 and
2.

<span id="ii.viii.vi-p6"></span>Theodoret (*H. E.* V. 3) gives a
different account of the way in which the dispute between Melitius and
Paulinus came to an end, giving the glory to Melitius for the eirenic
overture above described, and representing Paulinus as constrained to
accept it against his will by the political head of the community.
