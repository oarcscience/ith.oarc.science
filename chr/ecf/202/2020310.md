<span id="iii.vii.viii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*How the Armenians
and Persians embraced Christianity*.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.viii-p2.1"></span>Subsequently</span> the Christian religion
became known to the neighboring tribes and was very greatly
disseminated. <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154) The Armenians,
I have understood, were the first to embrace Christianity. <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155) It is said that Tiridates, then the
sovereign of that nation, became a Christian by means of a marvelous
Divine sign which was wrought in his own house; and that he issued
commands to all the subjects, by a herald, to adopt the same
religion. <span id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156) I think that the
beginning of the conversion of the Persians <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157) was owing to their intercourse with
the Osroenians and Armenians; for it is likely that they would converse
with such Divine men and make experience of their virtue.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p3"></span>This paragraph is regarded by Valesius
as spurious.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p4"></span>The source of this chapter certainly
is not Moses Chorenensis. Tiridates III. reigned <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.viii-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 286–342. At first a
persecutor, through Gregory the Illuminator he became a Christian. Yet
parts of Armenia were Christianized much earlier. Dionysius bishop of
Alexandria wrote a letter on Repentance to the Armenians in the reign of
Gallus. Eus. *H. E.* vi. 46. Cf. Agathangelas, History of Tiridates the
Great, and the preaching of Gregory the Illuminator.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p5"></span>Here follows in the Greek text a
repetition, word for word, of the first two lines of this chapter, which
seem to be superfluous, if we do not reject the paragraph above.

<span id="iii.vii.viii-p6"></span>Soz. is wrong in attributing the
conversion of Persia to Armenia.
