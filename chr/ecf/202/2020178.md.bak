Tumult at Constantinople.*

<span id="ii.viii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xiv-p2.1"></span>At</span> the time when the emperor was
thus occupied on his military expedition, the Arians excited a great
tumult at Constantinople by such devices as these. Men are fond of
fabricating statements respecting matters about which they are in
ignorance; and if at any time they are given occasion they swell to a
prodigious extent rumors concerning what they wish, being ever fond of
change. This was strongly exemplified at Constantinople on the present
occasion: for each invented news concerning the war which was carrying
on at a distance, according to his own caprice, always presuming upon
the most disastrous results; and before the contest had yet commenced,
they spoke of transactions in reference to it, of which they knew
nothing, with as much assurance as if they had been spectators on the
very scene of action. Thus it was confidently affirmed that ‘the usurper
had defeated the emperor’s army,’ even the number of men slain on both
sides being specified; and that ‘the emperor himself had nearly fallen
into the usurper’s hands.’ Then the Arians, who had been excessively
exasperated by those being put in possession of the churches within the
city who had previously been the objects of their persecution, began to
augment these rumors by additions of their own. But since the currency
of such stories with increasing exaggeration, in time made even the
farmers themselves believe them—for those who had circulated them from
hearsay, affirmed to the authors of these falsehoods, that the accounts
they had received from them had been fully corroborated elsewhere; then
indeed the Arians were emboldened to commit acts of violence, and among
other outrages, to set fire to the house of Nectarius the bishop. This
was done in the second consulate <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md)
of Theodosius Augustus, which he bore with Cynegius.
