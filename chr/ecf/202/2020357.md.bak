<span id="iii.viii.xx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Athanasius again
reinstated by the Letter of Constantius, and receives his See. The
Arch-Priests of Antioch. Question put by Constantius to Athanasius. The
Praise of God in Hymns*.

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xx-p2.1"></span>When</span> Constans was apprised of what
had been enacted at Sardica, he wrote <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) to his brother to request him to
restore the followers of Athanasius and Paul to their own churches. As
Constantius seemed to hesitate, he wrote again, and threatened him with
war, unless he would consent to receive the bishops. Constantius, after
conferring on the subject with the bishops of the East, judged that it
would be foolish to excite on this account the horrors of civil war. He
therefore recalled Athanasius from Italy, and sent public carriages to
convey him on his return homewards, and wrote several letters requesting
his speedy return. Athanasius, who was then residing at Aquilea, on
receiving the letters of Constantius, repaired to Rome to take leave of
Julius and his friends. Julius parted from him with great demonstrations
of friendship, and gave him a letter addressed to the clergy and people
of Alexandria, in which he spoke of him as a wonderful man, deserving of
renown by the numerous trials he had undergone, and congratulated the
church of Alexandria on the return of so good a priest, and exhorted
them to follow his doctrines.

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p4"></span>He then proceeded to Antioch in Syria,
where the emperor was then residing. Leontius presided over the churches
of that region; for after the flight of Eustathius, those who held
heretical sentiments had seized the see of Antioch. The first bishop
they appointed was Euphronius; to him succeeded Placetus; and afterwards
Stephen. This latter was deposed as being unworthy of the dignity, and
Leontius obtained the bishopric. Athanasius avoided him as a heretic,
and communed with those who were <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span
id="iii.viii.xx-Page_299"></span>called Eustathians, who assembled in a
private house. Since he found that Constantius was well disposed, and
agreeable, and it looked as if the emperor would restore his own church
to him, Constantius, at the instigation of the leaders of the opposing
heresy, replied as follows: “I am ready to perform all that I promised
when I recalled you; but it is just that you should in return grant me a
favor, and that is, that you yield one of the numerous churches which
are under your sway to those who are averse to holding communion with
you.” Athanasius replied: “O emperor, it is exceedingly just and
necessary to obey your commands, and I will not gainsay, but as in the
city of Antioch there are many who eschew communion between the
heterodox and ourselves, I seek a like favor that one church may be
conceded to us, and that we may assemble there in safety.” As the
request of Athanasius appeared reasonable to the emperor, the heterodox
deemed it more politic to keep quiet; for they reflected that their
peculiar opinions could never gain any ground in Alexandria, on account
of Athanasius, who was able both to retain those who held the same
sentiments as himself, and lead those of contrary opinions; and that,
moreover if they gave up one of the churches of Antioch, the
Eustathians, who were very numerous, would assemble together, and then
probably attempt innovations, since it would be possible for them
without risk to retain those whom they held. Besides, the heterodox
perceived that, although the government of the churches was in their
hands, all the clergy and people did not conform to their
doctrines. <span id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md) When they sang
hymns to God, they were, according to custom, divided into choirs, and,
at the end of the odes, each one declared what were his own peculiar
sentiments. Some offered praise to “the Father *and* the Son,” regarding
them as co-equal in glory; others glorified “The Father *by* the Son,”
to denote by the insertion of the preposition that they considered the
Son to be inferior to the Father. While these occurrences took place,
Leontius, the bishop of the opposite faction, who then presided over the
see of Antioch, did not dare to prohibit the singing of hymns to God
which were in accordance with the tradition of the Nicæan Synod, for he
feared to excite an insurrection of the people. It is related, however,
that he once raised his hand to his head, the hairs of which were quite
white, and said, “When this snow is dissolved, there will be plenty of
mud.” By this he intended to signify that, after his death, the
different modes of singing hymns would give rise to great seditions, and
that his successors would not show the same consideration to the people
which he had manifested.
