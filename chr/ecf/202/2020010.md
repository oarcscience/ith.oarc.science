<span id="ii.iv.i-p8"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.i-p8.1"></span>Eusebius</span>, surnamed Pamphilus, <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) writing the History of the
Church <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) in ten books, closed it
with that period of the emperor Constantine, when the persecution which
Diocletian had begun against the Christians came to an end. Also in
writing the life of Constantine, this same author has but slightly
treated of matters regarding Arius, being more intent on the rhetorical
finish of his composition and the praises of the emperor, than on an
accurate statement of facts. Now, as we propose to write the details of
what has taken place in the churches since his time to our own day, we
begin with the narration of the particulars which he has left out, and
we shall not be solicitous to display a parade of words, but to lay
before the reader what we have been able to collect from documents, and
what we have heard from those who were familiar with the facts as they
told them. And since it has an important bearing on the matter in hand,
it will be proper to enter into a brief account of Constantine’s
conversion to Christianity, making a beginning with this event.

<span id="ii.iv.i-p9"></span>Eusebius seems to have adopted this name as
a token of friendship and respect for Pamphilus, bishop of Cæsarea. See
McGiffert, *Prolegomena* in Vol. I., Second Series of Post-Nicene
Fathers.

<span id="ii.iv.i-p10"></span>Eusebius’ *Ecclesiastical History* ends
with the death of Licinius in 323. His *Life of Constantine* is in a
sense a continuation of the History, and yet as it is very well
characterized by Socrates, it is a eulogy and therefore its style and
selection of facts are affected by its purpose, rendering it too
inadequate as a continuation of the *Ecclesiastical History;* hence
Socrates’ constraint to review some of the events which naturally fall
in Eusebius’ period.
