Books of Origen*.

<span id="iii.xiii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.xi-p2.1"></span>A question</span> was at this period
agitated in Egypt, which had been propounded a short time previously,
namely, whether it is right to believe that God is
anthropomorphic. <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598) Because they
laid hold of the sacred words with simplicity and without any
questioning, most of the monks of that part of the world were of this
opinion; and supposed that God possessed eyes, a face, and hands, and
other members of the bodily organization. But those who searched into
the hidden meaning of the terms of Scripture held the opposite; and they
maintained that those who denied the incorporeality of God were guilty
of blasphemy. This later opinion was espoused by Theophilus, and
preached by him in the church; and in the epistle <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599) which, according to custom, he
wrote respecting the celebration of the passover, he took occasion to
state that God ought to be regarded as incorporeal, as alien to a human
form. When it was signified to the Egyptian monks that Theophilus had
broached these sentiments, they went to Alexandria, assembled the people
together in one place, excited a tumult, and determined upon slaying the
bishop as an impious man. Theophilus, however, presented himself to the
insurgents forthwith, and said to them, “When I look upon you, it is as
if I beheld the face of God.” This address sufficiently mollified the
men; yielding their wrath, they replied, “Wherefore, then, if you really
hold orthodox doctrines, do you not denounce the books of Origen; since
those who read them are led into such opinions?” “Such has long been my
intention,” replied he, “and I shall do as you advise; for I blame not
less than you do, all those who follow the doctrines of Origen.” By
these means he deluded the brethren, and broke up the sedition.
