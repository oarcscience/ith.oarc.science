<span id="iii.viii.x-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*The Bishop of Rome writes
to the Bishops of the East in Favor of Athanasius, and they send an
Embassy to Rome who, with the Bishop of Rome, are to investigate the
Charges against the Eastern Bishops; this Deputation is dismissed by
Constans, the Cæsar*.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.x-p2.1"></span>The</span> bishops of Egypt, <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) having sent a declaration in
writing that these allegations were false, and Julius having been
apprised that Athanasius was far from being in safety in Egypt, sent for
him to his own city. He replied at the same time to the letter of the
bishops who were convened at Antioch, for just then he happened to have
received their epistle, <span id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242.md) and
accused them of having clandestinely introduced innovations <span
id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="iii.viii.x-Page_289"></span>contrary to the dogmas of the Nicene
council, and of having violated the laws of the Church, by neglecting to
invite him to join their Synod; for he alleged that there is a
sacerdotal canon which declares that whatever is enacted contrary to the
judgment of the bishop of Rome is null. He also reproached them for
having deviated from justice in all their proceedings against
Athanasius, both at Tyre and Mareotis, and stated that the decrees
enacted at the former city had been annulled, on account of the calumny
concerning the hand of Arsenius, and at the latter city, on account of
the absence of Athanasius. Last of all he reprehended the arrogant style
of their epistle.

<span id="iii.viii.x-p5"></span>Julius was induced by all these reasons
to undertake the defense of Athanasius and of Paul: the latter had
arrived in Italy not long previously, and had lamented bitterly these
calamities. When Julius perceived that what he had written to those who
held the sacerdotal dignity in the East was of no avail, he made the
matter known to Constans the emperor. Accordingly, Constans wrote to his
brother Constantius, requesting him to send some of the bishops of the
East, that they might assign a reason for the edicts of deposition which
they had passed. Three bishops were selected for this purpose; namely,
Narcissus, bishop of Irenopolis, in Cilicia; Theodore, bishop of
Heraclea, in Thrace; and Mark, bishop of Arethusa, in Syria. On their
arrival in Italy, they strove to justify their actions and to persuade
the emperor that the sentence passed by the Eastern Synod was just.
Being required to produce a statement of their belief, they concealed
the formulary they had drawn up at Antioch, and presented another
written confession <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md) which was
equally at variance with the doctrines approved at Nicæa. Constans
perceived that they had unjustly entrapped both Paul and Athanasius, and
had ejected them from communion, not for charges against his conduct, as
the depositions held, but simply on account of differences in doctrine;
and he accordingly dismissed the deputation without giving any credit to
the representations for which they had come.
