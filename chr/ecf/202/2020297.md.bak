<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*What the Council
determined about Arius; the Condemnation of his Followers; his Writings
are to be burnt; certain of the High Priests differ from the Council;
the Settlement of the Passover*.

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxi-p2.1"></span>It</span> ought to be known, that they
affirmed the Son to be consubstantial with the Father; and that those
are to be excommunicated and voted aliens to the Catholic Church, who
assert that there was a time in which the Son existed not, and before He
was begotten He was not, and that He was made from what had no
existence, and that He is of another hypostasis or substance from the
Father, and that He is subject to change or mutation. This decision was
sanctioned by Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia; by Theognis, bishop of
Nicæa; by Maris, bishop of Chalcedon; by Patrophilus, bishop of
Scythopolis; and by Secundus, bishop of Ptolemaïs in Libya. <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) Eusebius Pamphilus, however,
withheld his assent for a little while, but on further examination
assented. <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) The council
excommunicated Arius and his adherents, and prohibited his entering
Alexandria. The words in which his opinions were couched were likewise
condemned, as also a work entitled “Thalia,” which he had written on the
subject. I have not read this book, but I understand that it is of a
loose character, resembling in license Sotadus. <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) It ought to be known that although
Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, and Theognis, bishop of Nicæa, assented
to the document of this faith set forth by the council, they neither
agreed nor subscribed to the deposition of Arius. The emperor punished
Arius with exile, and dispatched edicts to the bishops and people of
every country, denouncing him and his adherents as ungodly, and
commanding. that their books should be destroyed, in order that no
remembrance of him or of the doctrine which he had broached might
remain. Whoever should be found secreting his writings and who should
not burn them immediately on the accusation, should undergo the penalty
of death, and suffer capital punishment. The emperor wrote letters to
every city against Arius and those who had received his doctrines, and
commanded Eusebius and Theognis to quit the cities whereof they were
bishops; he addressed himself in particular to the church of Nicomedia,
urging it to adhere to the faith which had been set forth by the
council, to elect orthodox bishops, to obey them, and to let the <span
id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span id="iii.vi.xxi-Page_256"></span>past
fall into oblivion; and he threatened with punishment those who should
venture to speak well of the exiled bishops, or to adopt their
sentiments. In these and in other letters, he manifested resentment
against Eusebius, because he had previously adopted the opinions of the
tyrant, and had engaged in his plots. In accordance with the imperial
edicts, Eusebius and Theognis were ejected from the churches which they
held, and Amphion received that of Nicomedia, and Chrestus that of
Nicæa. On the termination of this doctrinal controversy, the council
decided that the Paschal feast should be celebrated at the same time in
every place. <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md)
