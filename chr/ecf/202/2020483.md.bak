<span id="iii.xii.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*St. Donatus, Bishop
of Eurœa, and Theotimus, High-Priest of Scythia*.

<span id="iii.xii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>There</span> were at this period many
other bishops <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) in various
parts of the empire highly celebrated for their sanctity and high
qualifications, of whom Donatus, bishop of Eurœa <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) in Epirus, <span id="page_395">p.
395</span> <span id="iii.xii.xxvi-Page_395"></span>deserves to be
particularly instanced. The inhabitants of the country relate many
extraordinary miracles which he performed, of which the most celebrated
seems to have been the destruction of a dragon of enormous size. It had
stationed itself on the high road, at a place called Chamægephyræ and
devoured sheep, goats, oxen, horses, and men. Donatus came upon this
beast, attacked it unarmed, without sword, lance, or javelin; it raised
its head, and was about to dash upon him, when Donatus made the sign of
the cross with his finger in the air, and spat upon the dragon. The
saliva entered its mouth, and it immediately expired. As it lay extended
on the earth it did not appear inferior in size to the noted serpents of
India. I have been informed that the people of the country yoked eight
pair of oxen to transport the body to a neighboring field, where they
burnt it, that it might not during the process of decomposition corrupt
the air and generate disease. The tomb of this bishop is deposited in a
magnificent house of prayer which bears his name. It is situated near a
fountain of many waters, which God caused to rise from the ground in
answer to his prayer, in an arid spot where no water had previously
existed. For it is said that one day, when on a journey, he had to pass
through this locality; and, perceiving that his companions were
suffering from thirst, he moved the soil with his hands and engaged in
prayer; before his prayer was concluded, a spring of water arose from
the ground, which has never since been dried up. The inhabitants of
Isoria, a village in the territory of Eurœa, bear testimony to the truth
of this narration.

<span id="iii.xii.xxvi-p5"></span>The church of Tomi, and indeed all the
churches of Scythia, were at this period under the government of
Theotimus, a Scythian. He had been brought up in the practice of
philosophy; and his virtues had so won the admiration of the barbarian
Huns, who dwelt on the banks of the Ister, that they called him the god
of the Romans, for they had experience of divine deeds wrought by him.
It is said that one day, when traveling toward the country of the
barbarians, he perceived some of them advancing towards Tomi. His
attendants burst forth into lamentations, and gave themselves up at once
for lost; but he merely descended from horseback, and prayed. The
consequence was, that the barbarians passed by without seeing him, his
attendants, or the horses from which they had dismounted. As these
tribes frequently devastated Scythia by their predatory incursions, he
tried to subdue the ferocity of their disposition by presenting them
with food and gifts. One of the barbarians hence concluded that he was a
man of wealth, and, determining to take him prisoner, leaned upon his
shield, as was his custom when parleying with his enemies; the man
raised up his right hand in order to throw a rope, which he firmly
grasped, over the bishop, for he intended to drag him away to his own
country; but in the attempt, his hand remained extended in the air, and
the barbarian was not released from his terrible bonds until his
companions had implored Theotimus to intercede with God in his behalf.

<span id="iii.xii.xxvi-p6"></span>It is said that Theotimus always
retained the long hair which he wore when he first devoted himself to
the practice of philosophy. He was very temperate, had no stated hours
for his repasts, but ate and drank when compelled to do so by the calls
of hunger and of thirst. I consider it to be the part of a philosopher
to yield to the demands of these appetites from necessity, and not from
the love of sensual gratification.

life of Donatus, which was probably incorporated in Anastasius’
translation. A Greek biography of Theotimus was not unlikely the basis
of the account of the bishop of Tomi.
