id="iii.vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Erection of a Temple
by Constantine the Great at Golgotha, in Jerusalem; its Dedication*.

<span id="iii.vii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>The</span> temple, <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191) called the “Great Martyrium,” which
was built in the place of the skull at Jerusalem, was completed about
the thirtieth year <span id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192) of the
reign of Constantine; and Marianus, an official, who was a short-hand
writer of the emperor, came to Tyre and delivered a letter from the
emperor to the council, commanding them to repair quickly to Jerusalem,
in order to consecrate the temple. Although this had been previously
determined upon, yet the emperor deemed it necessary that the disputes
which prevailed among the bishops who had been convened at Tyre should
be first adjusted, and that they should be purged of all discord and
grief before going to the consecration of the temple. For it is fitting
to such a festival for the priests to be like-minded. When the bishops
arrived at Jerusalem, the temple was therefore consecrated, as likewise
numerous ornaments and gifts, which were sent by the emperor and are
still preserved in the sacred edifice; their costliness and magnificence
is such that they cannot be looked upon without exciting wonder. Since
that period the anniversary of the consecration has been celebrated with
great pomp by the church of Jerusalem; <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193) the festival continues eight days,
initiation by baptism is administered, and people from every <span

id="iii.vii.xxvi-Page_277"></span>region under the sun resort to
Jerusalem during this festival, and visit the sacred places.
