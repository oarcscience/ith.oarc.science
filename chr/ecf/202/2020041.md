id="ii.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII</span>.—*On the Departure of
Athanasius, those who composed the Synod vote his Deposition.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> Athanasius departed, hastening
to the emperor, and the Synod in the first place condemned him in his
absence; and when the result of the enquiry which had been instituted at
Mareotis was presented, they voted to depose him; loading him with
opprobrious epithets in their sentence of deposition, but being wholly
silent respecting the disgraceful defeat of the charge of murder brought
by his calumniators. They moreover received into communion Arse<span

who was reported to have been murdered; and he who had formerly been a
bishop of the Melitian heresy subscribed to the deposition of Athanasius
as bishop of the city of Hypselopolis. Thus by an extraordinary course
of circumstances, the alleged victim of assassination by Athanasius, was
found alive to assist in deposing him.
