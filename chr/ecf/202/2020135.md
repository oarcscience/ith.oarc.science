id="ii.vii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Birth of Valentinian the
Younger.*

<span id="ii.vii.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.x-p2.1"></span>Soon</span> after the conclusion of this war,
and under the same consulate, <span id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588) a
son was born to Valentinian, the emperor in the Western parts, to whom
the same name as his father’s was given. For Gratian had been born
previously to his becoming emperor.

<span id="ii.vii.x-p3"></span>Sozomen (VI. 10) says the same. There were
two Valentinians in the second generation; one a son of Valens, and
another the son of Valentinian the Elder. According to Idatius’ *Fasti,*
it was the former that was born during the consulate of Gratian and
Dagalaifus; so that Socrates was in error here, confusing perhaps the
two younger Valentinians. Valesius adduces other reasons proving the
same, which it is unnecessary to repeat here.
