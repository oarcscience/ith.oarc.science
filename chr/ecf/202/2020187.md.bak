<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII</span>.—*The Author’s Views
respecting the Celebration of Easter, Baptism, Fasting, Marriage, the
Eucharist, and Other Ecclesiastical Rites.*

<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>As</span> we have touched the subject I
deem it not unreasonable to say a few words concerning Easter. It
appears to me that neither the ancients nor moderns who have affected to
follow the Jews, have had any rational foundation for contending so
obstinately about it. For they have not taken into consideration the
fact that when Judaism was changed into Christianity, the obligation to
observe the Mosaic law and the ceremonial types ceased. And the proof of
the matter is plain; for no law of Christ permits Christians to imitate
the Jews. On the contrary the apostle expressly forbids it; not only
rejecting circumcision, but also deprecating contention about festival
days. In his epistle to the Galatians <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) he writes, ‘Tell me ye that desire to
be under the law, do ye not hear the law?’ And continuing his train of
argument, he demonstrates that the Jews were in bondage as servants, but
that those who have come to Christ are ‘called into the liberty of
sons.’ <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) Moreover he exhorts them
in no way to regard ‘days, and months, and years.’ <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) Again in his epistle to the
Colossians <span id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) he distinctly
declares, that such observances are merely shadows: wherefore he says,
‘Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any
holy-day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath-days; which are a shadow
of things to come.’ The same truths are also confirmed by him in the
epistle to the Hebrews <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) in these
words: ‘For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a
change also of the law.’ Neither the apostles, therefore, nor the
Gospels, <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) have anywhere imposed
the ‘yoke of servitude’ <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) on those
who have embraced the truth; but have left Easter and every other feast
to be honored by the gratitude of the recipients of grace. Wherefore,
inasmuch as men love festivals, because they afford them cessation from
labor: each individual in every place, according to his own pleasure,
has by a prevalent custom celebrated the memory of the saving passion.
The Saviour and his apostles have enjoined us by no law to keep this
feast: nor do the Gospels and apostles threaten us with any penalty,
punishment, or curse for the neglect of it, as the Mosaic law does the
Jews. It is merely for the sake of historical accuracy, and for the
reproach of the Jews, because they polluted themselves with blood on
their very feasts, that it is recorded in the Gospels that our Saviour
suffered in the days of ‘unleavened bread.’ <span
id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) The aim of the apostles was not to
appoint festival days, but to teach a righteous life and piety. And it
seems to me that just as many other customs have been established in
individual localities according to usage. So also the feast of Easter
came to be observed in each place according to the individual
peculiarities of the peoples inasmuch as none of the apostles legislated
on the matter. And that the observance originated not by legislation,
but as a custom the facts themselves indicate. In Asia Minor most people
kept the fourteenth day of the moon, disregarding the sabbath: yet they
never separated from those who did otherwise, until Victor, bishop of
Rome, influenced by too ardent a zeal, fulminated a sentence of
excommunication against the Quartodecimans <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) in Asia. Wherefore also Irenæus,
bishop of Lyons in France, severely censured Victor by letter for his
immoderate heat; <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) telling him
that although the ancients differed in their celebration of Easter, they
did not desist from intercommunion. Also that Polycarp, bishop of
Smyrna, who afterwards suffered martyrdom under Gordian, <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) continued to communicate with Anicetus
bishop of Rome, although he himself, accord<span id="page_131">p.
131</span> <span id="ii.viii.xxiii-Page_131"></span>ing to the usage of
his native Smyrna, kept Easter on the fourteenth day of the moon, as
Eusebius attests in the fifth book of his *Ecclesiastical
History*. <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) While therefore some
in Asia Minor observed the day above-mentioned, others in the East kept
that feast on the sabbath indeed, but differed as regards the month. The
former thought the Jews should be followed, though they were not exact:
the latter kept Easter after the equinox, refusing to celebrate with the
Jews; ‘for,’ said they, ‘it ought to be celebrated when the sun is in
Aries, in the month called Xanthicus by the Antiochians, and April by
the Romans.’ In this practice, they averred, they conformed not to the
modern Jews, who are mistaken in almost everything, but to the ancients,
and to Josephus according to what he has written in the third book of
his *Jewish Antiquities*. <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) Thus
these people were at issue among themselves. But all other Christians in
the Western parts, and as far as the ocean itself, are found to have
celebrated Easter after the equinox, from a very ancient tradition. And
in fact these acting in this manner have never disagreed on this
subject. It is not true, as some have pretended, that the Synod under
Constantine altered this festival: <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) for Constantine himself, writing to
those who differed respecting it, recommended that as they were few in
number, they could agree with the majority of their brethren. His letter
will be found at length in the third book of the *Life of Constantine*
by Eusebius; but the passage in it relative to Easter runs thus: <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md)

<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p18"></span>‘It is a becoming order which all
the churches in the Western, Southern, and Northern parts of the world
observe, and some places in the East also. Wherefore all on the present
occasion have judged it right, and I have pledged myself that it will
have the acquiescence of your prudence, that what is unanimously
observed in the city of Rome, throughout Italy, Africa, and the whole of
Egypt, in Spain, France, Britain, Libya, and all Greece, the diocese of
Asia and Pontus, and Cilicia, your wisdom also will readily embrace;
considering not only that the number of churches in the aforesaid places
is greater, but also that while there should be a universal concurrence
in what is most reasonable, it becomes us to have nothing in common with
the perfidious Jews.’

<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p19"></span>Such is the tenor of the emperor’s
letter. Moreover the Quartodecimans affirm that the observance of the
fourteenth day was delivered to them by the apostle John: while the
Romans and those in the Western parts assure us that their usage
originated with the apostles Peter and Paul. Neither of these parties
however can produce any written testimony in confirmation of what they
assert. But that the time of keeping Easter in various places is
dependent on usage, I infer from this, that those who agree in faith,
differ among themselves on questions of usage. And it will not perhaps
be unseasonable to notice here the diversity of customs in the
churches. <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) The fasts before
Easter will be found to be differently observed among different people.
Those at Rome fast three successive weeks before Easter, excepting
Saturdays and Sundays. <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) Those in
Illyrica and all over Greece and Alexandria observe a fast of six weeks,
which they term ‘The forty days’ fast.’ <span
id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) Others commencing their fast from the
seventh week before Easter, and fasting three five days only, and that
at intervals, yet call that time ‘The forty days’ fast.’ It is indeed
surprising to me that thus differing in the number of days, they should
both give it one common appellation; but some assign one reason for it,
and others another, according to their several fancies. One can see also
a disagreement about the manner of abstinence from food, as well as
about the number of days. Some wholly abstain from things that have
life: others feed on fish only of all living creatures: many together
with fish, eat fowl also, saying that according to Moses, <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) these were likewise made out of the
waters. Some abstain from eggs, and all kinds of fruits: others partake
of dry bread only; still others eat not even this: while others having
fasted till the ninth hour, <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md)
afterwards take any sort of food without distinction. And among various
nations there are other usages, for which innumerable reasons are
assigned. Since however no one can produce a written command as an
authority, it is evident that the apostles left each one to his own free
will in the matter, to the end that each might <span id="page_132">p.
132</span> <span id="ii.viii.xxiii-Page_132"></span>perform what is good
not by constraint or necessity. Such is the difference in the churches
on the subject of fasts. Nor is there less variation in regard to
religious assemblies. <span id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md) For
although almost all churches throughout the world celebrate the sacred
mysteries on the sabbath <span id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) of
every week, yet the Christians of Alexandria and at Rome, on account of
some ancient tradition, have ceased to do this. The Egyptians in the
neighborhood of Alexandria, and the inhabitants of Thebaïs, hold their
religious assemblies on the sabbath, but do not participate of the
mysteries in the manner usual among Christians in general: for after
having eaten and satisfied themselves with food of all kinds, in the
evening making their offerings <span id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md)
they partake of the mysteries. At Alexandria again, on the
Wednesday <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) in Passion week and on
Good Friday, the scriptures are read, and the doctors expound them; and
all the usual services are performed in their assemblies, except the
celebration of the mysteries. This practice in Alexandria is of great
antiquity, for it appears that Origen most commonly taught in the church
on those days. He being a very learned teacher in the Sacred Books, and
perceiving that the ‘impotence of the law’ <span
id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md) of Moses was weakened by literal
explanation, gave it a spiritual interpretation; declaring that there
has never been but one true Passover, which the Saviour celebrated when
he hung upon the cross: for that he then vanquished the adverse powers,
and erected this as a trophy against the devil. In the same city of
Alexandria, readers and chanters <span id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792.md)
are chosen indifferently from the catechumens and the faithful; whereas
in all other churches the faithful only are promoted to these offices. I
myself, also, learned of another custom in Thessaly. If a clergyman in
that country, after taking orders, should sleep with his wife, whom he
had legally married before his ordination, he would be degraded. <span
id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793.md) In the East, indeed, all clergymen,
and even the bishops themselves, abstain from their wives: but this they
do of their own accord, and not by the necessity of any law; for there
have been among them many bishops, who have had children by their lawful
wives, during their episcopate. It is said that the author of the usage
which obtains in Thessaly was Heliodorus bishop of Tricca in that
country; under whose name there are love books extant, entitled
*Ethiopica,* <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md) which he composed
in his youth. The same custom prevails at Thessalonica, and in
Macedonia, and in Greece. I have also known of another peculiarity in
Thessaly, which is, that they baptize there on the days of Easter only;
in consequence of which a very great number of them die without having
received baptism. At Antioch in Syria the site of the church is
inverted; so that the altar does not face toward the east, but toward
the west. <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md) In Greece, however,
and at Jerusalem and in Thessaly they go to prayers as soon as the
candles are lighted, in the same manner as the Novatians do at
Constantinople. At Cæsarea likewise, and in Cappadocia, and in Cyprus,
the presbyters and bishops expound the Scriptures in the evening, after
the candles are lighted. The Novatians of the Hellespont do not perform
their prayers altogether in the same manner as those of Constantinople;
in most things, however, their usage is similar to that of the
prevailing <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md) church. In short, it
is impossible to find anywhere, among all the sects, two churches which
agree exactly in their ritual respecting prayers. At Alexandria no
presbyter is allowed to address the public: a regulation which was made
after Arius had raised a disturbance in that church. At Rome they fast
every Saturday. <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md) At Cæsarea of
Cappadocia they exclude from communion those who have sinned after
baptism as the Novatians do. The same discipline was practiced by the
Macedonians in the Hellespont, and by the Quartodecimans in Asia. The
Novatians in Phrygia do not admit such as have twice married; <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md) but those of Constanti<span
id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="ii.viii.xxiii-Page_133"></span>nople neither admit nor reject them
openly, while in the Western parts they are openly received. This
diversity was occasioned, as I imagine, by the bishops who in their
respective eras governed the churches; and those who received these
several rites and usages, transmitted them as laws to their posterity.
However, to give a complete catalogue of all the various customs and
ceremonial observances in use throughout every city and country would be
difficult—rather impossible; but the instances we have adduced are
sufficient to show that the Easter Festival was from some remote
precedent differently celebrated in every particular province. They talk
at random therefore who assert that the time of keeping Easter was
altered in the Nicene Synod; for the bishops there convened earnestly
labored to reduce the first dissenting minority to uniformity of
practice with the rest of the people. Now that many differences existed
even in the apostolic age of the church occasioned by such subjects, was
not unknown even to the apostles themselves, as the book of *The Acts*
testifies. For when they understood that a disturbance occurred among
believers on account of a dissension of the Gentiles, having all met
together, they promulgated a Divine law, giving it the form of a letter.
By this sanction they liberated Christians from the bondage of formal
observances, and all vain contention about these things; and they taught
them the path of true piety, prescribing such things only as were
conducive to its attainment. The epistle itself, which I shall here
transcribe, is recorded in *The Acts of the Apostles.* <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md)

<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p38"></span>‘The apostles and elders and
brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in
Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain
which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your
souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave
no such commandment: it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one
accord, to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you
the same thing by mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us,
to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that ye
abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, ye
shall do well. Fare ye well.’

<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p39"></span>These things indeed pleased God: for
the letter expressly says, ‘It seemed good to the Holy Ghost to lay upon
you no greater burden than these necessary things.’ There are
nevertheless some persons who, disregarding these precepts, suppose all
fornication to be an indifferent matter; but contend about holy-days as
if their lives were at stake, thus contravening the commands of God, and
legislating for themselves, and making of none effect the decree of the
apostles: neither do they perceive that they are themselves practicing
the contrary to those things which God approved. It is possible easily
to extend our discourse respecting Easter, and demonstrate that the Jews
observe no exact rule either in the time or manner of celebrating the
paschal solemnity: and that the Samaritans, who are an offshoot from the
Jews, always celebrate this festival after the equinox. But this subject
would require a distinct and copious treatise: I shall therefore merely
add, that those who affect so much to imitate the Jews, and are so very
anxious about an accurate observance of types, ought to depart from them
in no particular. For if they have chosen to be so correct, they must
not only observe days and months, but all other things also, which
Christ (who was ‘made under the law’) <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) did in the manner of the Jews; or
which he unjustly suffered from them; or wrought typically for the good
of all men. He entered into a ship and taught. He ordered the Passover
to be made ready in an upper room. He commanded an ass that was tied to
be loosed. He proposed a man bearing a pitcher of water as a sign to
them for hastening their preparations for the Passover. \[He did\] an
infinite number of other things of this nature which are recorded in the
gospels. And yet those who suppose themselves to be justified by keeping
this feast, would think it absurd to observe any of these things in a
bodily manner. For no doctor ever dreams of going to preach from a
ship—no person imagines it necessary to go up into an upper room to
celebrate the Passover there—they never tie, and then loose an ass
again—and finally no one enjoins another to carry a pitcher of water, in
order that the symbols might be fulfilled. They have justly regarded
such <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="ii.viii.xxiii-Page_134"></span>things as savoring rather of Judaism:
for the Jews are more solicitous about outward solemnities than the
obedience of the heart; and therefore are they under the curse, because
they do not discern the spiritual bearing of the Mosaic law, but rest in
its types and shadows. Those who favor the Jews admit the allegorical
meaning of these things; and yet they wage a deadly warfare against the
observance of days and months, without applying to them a similar sense:
thus do they necessarily involve themselves in a common condemnation
with the Jews.

<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p41"></span>But enough I think has been said
concerning these things. Let us now return to the subject we were
previously treating of, the fact that the Church once divided did not
stay with that division, but that those separated were again divided
among themselves, taking occasion from the most trivial grounds. The
Novatians, as I have stated, were divided among themselves on account of
the feast of Easter, the controversy not being restricted to one point
only. For in the different provinces some took one view of the question,
and some another, disagreeing not only about the month, but the days of
the week also, and other unimportant matters; in some places they hold
separate assemblies because of it, in others they unite in mutual
communion.

three weeks Saturdays were excepted. Cf. also Ceillier, *Hist. des
Auteurs Sacrés et Ecclesiast.* Vol. VIII. p. 523, 524. Valesius,
however, quotes Pope Leo (fourth sermon on the Lent Fast) and Venerable
Beda to prove that Socrates’ assertion concerning the exception of
Saturday may be defended. See Quesnell, *de Jejunio Sabbati;* Bingham,
*Origin. Eccl.* XXI. I. 14; also Beveridge, *de Jejunio Quadragesimali.*

<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p24"></span>Valesius rightly conjectures that
very few observed this mode of fasting during Lent, basing his opinion
on the order of worship and various deprecatory expressions in ancient
authors with respect to it. It may be noted that the Mohammedan Fast of
Ramadan is observed on the same principle and in a similar manner. The
fast begins with the dawn of the sun and continues until sunset, being
complete for that space of time. With the setting of the sun, however,
every person is at liberty to eat as he may please.

4. ‘Congregation.’ To these we may add on the authority of Casaubon
(*Exercit.* XVI. *ad Annal. Baronii,* No. 42) 5. ‘The celebration of the
Eucharist.’ It is in the second sense given by Sophocles that it is used
here.

1. ‘The Sabbath’ \[of the Jews\] (so in the LXX and Jewish writers). 2.
‘The week.’ 3. ‘Saturday.’ Many early Christians, however, continued to
observe the Jewish Sabbath along with the first day of the week. Cf.

<span id="ii.viii.xxiii-p35"></span>*Apost. Can.* 64, provides that no
cleric or layman shall fast on the Sabbath day (Saturday, see note 22,
above), the former on pain of being deposed, the latter, of being
excommunicated. It appears, however, that the Roman church observed the
day as a fast, while the Greek church held it to be a feast. Socrates,
however, seems to contradict the statement he had made above (see note
17) that at Rome Saturdays and Sundays were excepted from the list of
fasting days in Lent. From Augustine’s *Epistles,* 36. 31 *et al.*, it
appears that he fasted on Saturday and regarded this the regular and
proper course to be pursued, and actually pursued by members of the
church. Hence the present statement of Socrates must be taken as correct
to the exclusion of the former.

which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:
Forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have
troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no
commandment; it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to
choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and
Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also
shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. For it seemed good to
the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these
necessary things; that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and
from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which
if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.’
