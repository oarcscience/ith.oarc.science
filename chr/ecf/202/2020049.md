<span id="ii.iv.xl-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL</span>.—*The Funeral of the Emperor
Constantine.*

<span id="ii.iv.xl-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xl-p2.1"></span>The</span> body of the emperor was placed in a
coffin of gold by the proper persons, and then conveyed to
Constantinople, where it was laid out on an elevated bed of state in the
palace, surrounded by a guard, and treated with the same respect as when
he was alive, and this was done until the arrival of one of his sons.
When Constantius was come out of the eastern parts of the empire, it was
honored with an imperial sepulture, and deposited in the church called
*The Apostles:* which he had caused to be constructed for this very
purpose, that the emperors and prelates might receive a degree of
veneration but little inferior to that which was paid to the relics of
the apostles. The Emperor Constantine lived sixty-five years, and
reigned thirty-one. He died in the consulate of Felician and Tatian, on
the twenty-second of May, in the second year of the 278th
Olympiad. <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) This book, therefore,
embraces a period of thirty-one years.
