id="ii.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*The Arians ordain
Demophilus after the Death of Eudoxius at Constantinople; but the
Orthodox Party constitute Evagrius his Successor.*

<span id="ii.vii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xiv-p2.1"></span>The</span> Emperor Valens leaving
Constantinople again set out towards Antioch; but on his arrival at
Nicomedia, a city of Bithynia, his progress was arrested by the
following circumstances. Eudoxius the bishop of the Arian church who has
been in possession of the seat of the Constantinopolitan church for
nineteen <span id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607.md) years, died soon after
the emperor’s departure from that city, in the third consulate <span
id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md) of Valentinian and Valens. The Arians
therefore appointed Demophilus to succeed him; but the Homoousians
considering that an opportunity was afforded them, elected a certain
Evagrius, a person who maintained their own principles; and Eustathius,
who had been bishop of Antioch, formally ordained him. He had been
recalled from exile by Jovian, and had at this time privately come to
Constantinople, for the purpose of confirming the adherents to the
doctrine of the *homoousion.*
