id="ii.v.xxxv-Page_60"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV</span>.—*Of Aëtius the Syrian,
Teacher of Eunomius.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxv-p2.1"></span>At</span> Antioch in Syria another heresiarch
sprang up, Aëtius, surnamed Atheus. He agreed in doctrine with Arius,
and maintained the same opinions: but separated himself from the Arian
party because they had admitted Arius into communion. For Arius, as I
have before related, <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md)
entertaining one opinion in his heart, professed another with his lips;
having hypocritically assented to and subscribed the form of faith set
forth at the council of Nicæa, in order to deceive the reigning emperor.
On this account, therefore, Aëtius separated himself from the Arians. He
had, however, previously been a heretic, and a zealous advocate of Arian
views. After receiving some very scanty instruction at Alexandria, he
departed thence, and arrived at Antioch in Syria, which was his native
place, was ordained deacon by Leontius, who was then bishop of that
city. Upon this he began to astonish those who conversed with him by the
singularity of his discourses. And this he did in dependence on the
precepts of Aristotle’s *Categories;* there is a book of that name, the
scope of which he neither himself perceived, nor had been enlightened on
by intercourse with learned persons: so that he was little aware that he
was framing fallacious arguments to perplex and deceive himself. For
Aristotle had composed this work to exercise the ingenuity of his young
disciples, and to confound by subtle arguments the sophists who affected
to deride philosophy. Wherefore the Ephectic academicians, <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) who expound the writings of Plato and
Plotinus, censure the vain subtlety which Aristotle has displayed in
that book: but Aëtius, who never had the advantage of an academical
preceptor, adhered to the sophisms of the *Categories.* For this reason
he was unable to comprehend how there could be generation without a
beginning, and how that which was begotten can be co-eternal with him
who begat. In fact, Aëtius was a man of so superficial attainments, and
so little acquainted with the sacred Scriptures, and so extremely fond
of caviling, a thing which any clown might do, that he had never
carefully studied those ancient writers who have interpreted the
Christian oracles; wholly rejecting Clemens and Africanus and Origen,
men eminent for their information in every department of literature and
science. But he composed epistles both to the emperor Constantius, and
to some other persons, wherein he interwove tedious disputes for the
purpose of displaying his sophisms. He has therefore been surnamed
Atheus. But although his doctrinal statements were similar to those of
the Arians, yet from the abstruse nature of his syllogisms, which they
were unable to comprehend, his associates in Arianism pronounced him a
heretic. Being for that reason expelled from their church, he pretended
to have separated himself from their communion. Even in the present day
there are to be found some who from him were formerly named Aëtians, but
now Eunomians. For some time later Eunomius, who had been his
amanuensis, having been instructed by his master in this heretical mode
of reasoning, afterwards became the head of that sect. But of Eunomius
we shall speak more fully in the proper place. <span

<span id="ii.v.xxxv-p4"></span>Diogenes Laertius, *Proem.* XI (16),
says: ‘Philosophers were generally divided into two classes,—the
dogmatics, who spoke of things as they might be comprehended; and the
ephectics, who refused to define anything, and disputed so as to make
the understanding of them impossible.’ The word ‘ephectic’ is derived
from the verb <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.v.xxxv-p4.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.v.xxxv-p4.2"></span>πέχω</span>, ‘to hold back,’ and was used by
the philosophers to whom it is applied as a title because they claimed
to hold back their judgment, being unable to reach a conclusion. Cf.
also the name ‘skeptic,’ from <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.v.xxxv-p4.3"></span>σκέπτομαι</span> . See Zeller, *Stoics,
Epicureans, and Skeptics,* p. 525.
