<span id="iii.xiv.xvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*Honorius the Ruler, a
Lover of God. Death of Honorius. His Successors, Valentinian, and
Honoria his Daughter; the Peace which was then Worldwide*.

<span id="iii.xiv.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.xvi-p2.1"></span>This</span> is not the proper place to
enter into the details concerning the deaths of the tyrants; <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639) but I considered it necessary to
allude to the circumstance in order to show that to insure the stability
of imperial power, it is sufficient for an emperor to serve God with
reverence, which was the course pursued by Honorius. Galla Placidia, his
sister, born of the same father as himself, dwelt with him, and likewise
distinguished herself by real zeal in the maintenance of religion and of
the churches. After Constantius, who was a brave and able general, had
destroyed the tyrant Constantine, the emperor rewarded him by giving him
his sister in marriage; he also bestowed upon him the ermine and purple,
and admitted him to a share in the government. Constantius did not long
survive the promotion; he died soon after, and left two children,
Valentinian, who succeeded Honorius, and Honoria. Meanwhile the Eastern
Empire was free from wars, and contrary to all opinion, its affairs were
conducted with great order, for the ruler was still a youth. It seems as
if God openly manifested His favor towards the present emperor, not only
by disposing of warlike affairs in an unexpected way, but also by
revealing the sacred bodies of many persons who were of old most
distinguished for piety; among other relics, those of Zechariah, the
very ancient prophet, and of Stephen, who was ordained deacon by the
apostles, were discovered; and it seems incumbent upon me to describe
the mode, since the discovery of each was marvelous and divine. <span

<span id="iii.xiv.xvi-p4"></span>He recounts the discovery of Zechariah
only, while all the language here, and that of the beginning of the next
chapter, indicates his intention to describe both. Could the work then
have been concluded?
