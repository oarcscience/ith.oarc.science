id="ii.viii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Illness and Death
of Theodosius the Elder.*

<span id="ii.viii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Emperor Theodosius was in
consequence of the anxiety and fatigues connected with this war thrown
into bodily illness; and believing the disease which had attacked him
would be fatal, he became more concerned about the public affairs than
his own life, considering how great calamities often overtook the people
after the death of their sovereign. He therefore hastily summoned his
son Honorius from Constantinople, being principally desirous of setting
in order the state of things in the western parts of the empire. After
his son’s arrival at Milan, he seemed to recover a little, and gave
directions for the celebration of the games of the hippodrome on account
of his victory. Before dinner he was pretty well, and a spectator of the
sports; but after he had dined he became suddenly too ill to return to
them, and sent his son to preside in his stead; when the night came on
he died, it being the seventeenth of January, during consulate of
Olybrius and Probus. <span id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) This was in
the first year of the two hundred and ninety-fourth Olympiad. The
emperor Theodosius lived sixty years, <span
id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md) and reigned sixteen. This book
therefore comprehends the transactions of sixteen years and eight
months.

<span id="ii.viii.xxvii-p4"></span>There is some doubt as to the length
of Theodosius’ life; most of the ancient historians (Sozomen,
Theophanes, Cedrenus) agree with Socrates in giving it as sixty years.
Am. Marcellinus *Rerum Gestarum,* XXIX. 6. 15, and Victor, *Epit.*
XLVII., leave the impression that he was fifty.
