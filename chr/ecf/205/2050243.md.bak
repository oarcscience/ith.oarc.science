<span id="xi.ii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxv-p2.1"></span>What</span>, then, was it likely that the
master of the slave would choose to receive in his stead? It is possible
in the way of inference to make a guess as to his wishes in the matter,
if, that is, the manifest indications of what we are seeking for should
come into our hands. He then, who, as we before stated in the beginning
of this treatise, shut his eyes to the good in his envy of man in his
happy condition, he who generated in himself the murky cloud of
wickedness, he who suffered from the disease of the love of rule, that
primary and fundamental cause of propension to the bad and the mother,
so to speak, of all the wickedness that follows,—what would he accept in
exchange for the thing which he held, but something, to be sure, higher
and better, in the way of ransom, that thus, by receiving a gain in the
exchange, he might foster the more his own special passion of pride? Now
unquestionably in not one of those who had lived in history from the
beginning of the world had he been conscious of any such circumstance as
he observed to surround Him Who then manifested Himself, *i.e.*
conception without carnal connection, birth without impurity, motherhood
with virginity, voices of the unseen testifying from above to a
transcendent worth, the healing of natural disease, without the use of
means and of an extraordinary character, proceeding from Him by the mere
utterance of a word and exercise of His will, the restoration of the
dead to life, the absolution of the damned <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1998](#fn_1996.md) , the fear with which He inspired
devils, His power over tempests, His walking through the sea, not by the
waters separating on either side, and, as in the case of Moses’
miraculous power, making bare its depths for those who passed through,
but by the surface of the water presenting solid ground for His feet,
and by a firm and hard resistance supporting His steps; then, His
disregard for food as long as it pleased Him to abstain, His abundant
banquets in the wilderness wherewith many thousands were fully fed
(though neither did the heavens pour down manna on them, nor was their
need supplied by the earth producing corn for them in its natural way,
but that instance of munificence <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1999](#fn_1997.md) came out of the ineffable
store-houses of His Divine power), the bread ready in the hands of those
who distributed it, as if they were actually reaping it, and becoming
more, the more the eaters were filled; and then, the banquet on the
fish; not that the sea supplied their need, but He Who had stocked the
sea with its fish. But how is it possible to narrate in succession each
one of the Gospel miracles? The Enemy, therefore, beholding in Him such
power, saw also in Him an opportunity for an advance, in the exchange,
upon the value of what he held. For this reason he chooses Him as a
ransom <span id="fr_1998"></span>[2000](#fn_1998.md) for those who were
shut up in the prison of death. But it was out of his power to look on
the unclouded aspect of God; he must see in Him some portion of that
fleshly nature which through sin he had so long held in bondage.
Therefore it was that the Deity was invested with the flesh, in order,
that is, to secure that he, by looking upon something congenial and
kindred to himself, might have no fears in approaching that supereminent
power; and might yet by perceiving that power, showing as it did, yet
only gradually, more and more splendour in the miracles, deem what was
seen an object of desire rather than of fear. Thus, you see how goodness
was conjoined with justice, and how wisdom was not divorced from them.
For to have devised that the Divine power should have been containable
in the envelopment of a body, to the end that the Dispensation in our
behalf might not be thwarted through any fear inspired by the Deity
actually appearing, affords a demonstration of all these qualities at
once—goodness, wisdom, justice. His choosing to save man is a testimony
of his goodness; His making the redemption of the captive a matter of
exchange exhibits His justice, while the <span id="page_494">p.
494</span> <span id="xi.ii.xxv-Page_494"></span>invention whereby He
enabled the Enemy to apprehend that of which he was before incapable, is
a manifestation of supreme wisdom.

<span id="xi.ii.xxv-p3"></span> *the absolution of the damned.* These
words, wanting in all others, Krabinger has restored from the Codex B.
Morell translates “damnatorum absolutio.” The Greek is <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xxv-p3.1"></span>τὴν τῶν καταδίκων ἀνά&
207·ῥυσιν</span>. “Hæc Origenem sapiunt, qui damnatorum pœnis finem
statuit:” Krabinger. But here at all events it is not necessary to
accuse Gregory of this, since he is clearly speaking only of Christ’s
forgiveness of sins during His earthly ministry.

<span id="xi.ii.xxv-p5"></span> *he chooses Him as a ransom.* This
peculiar teaching of Gregory of Nyssa, that it was to the Devil, not God
the Father, that the ransom, *i.e.* Christ’s blood, was paid, is shared
by Origen, Ambrose, and Augustine. The latter says, “Sanguine Christi
diabolus non ditatus est, sed ligatus,” *i.e.* bound by compact. On the
other hand Gregory Naz. (tom. I. *Orat.* 42) and John Damascene (*De
Fid. Orthod.* iii. c. 27) give the ransom to the Father.
