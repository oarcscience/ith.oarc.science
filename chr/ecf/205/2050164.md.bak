<span id="ix.ii.ii.xv"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xv-p2.1"></span>But</span> if we apprehend at last the
perfection of this grace, we must understand as well what necessarily
follows from it; namely that it is not a single achievement, ending in
the subjugation of the body, but that in intention it reaches to and
pervades everything that is, or is considered, a right condition of the
soul. That soul indeed which in virginity cleaves to the true Bridegroom
will not remove herself merely from all bodily defilement; she will make
that abstension only the beginning of her purity, and will carry this
security from failure equally into everything else upon her path.
Fearing lest, from a too partial heart, she should by contact with evil
in any one direction give occasion for the least weakness of
unfaithfulness (to suppose <span id="page_361">p. 361</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.xv-Page_361"></span>such a case: but I will begin again
what I was going to say), that soul which cleaves to her Master so as to
become with Him one spirit, and by the compact of a wedded life has
staked the love of all her heart and all her strength on Him alone—that
soul will no more commit any other of the offences contrary to
salvation, than imperil her union with Him by cleaving to fornication;
she knows that between all sins there is a single kinship of impurity,
and that if she were to defile herself with but one <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1442](#fn_1440.md) , she could no longer retain her
spotlessness. An illustration will show what we mean. Suppose all the
water in a pool remaining smooth and motionless, while no disturbance of
any kind comes to mar the peacefulness of the spot; and then a stone
thrown into the pool; the movement in that one part <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1443](#fn_1441.md) will extend to the whole, and while
the stone’s weight is carrying it to the bottom, the waves that are set
in motion round it pass in circles <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1444](#fn_1442.md) into others, and so through all the
intervening commotion are pushed on to the very edge of the water, and
the whole surface is ruffled with these circles, feeling the movement of
the depths. So is the broad serenity and calm of the soul troubled by
one invading passion, and affected by the injury of a single part. They
tell us too, those who have investigated the subject, that the virtues
are not disunited from each other, and that to grasp the principle of
any one virtue will be impossible to one who has not seized that which
underlies the rest, and that the man who shows one virtue in his
character will necessarily show them all. Therefore, by contraries, the
depravation of anything in our moral nature will extend to the whole
virtuous life; and in very truth, as the Apostle tells us, the whole is
affected by the parts, and “if one member <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1445](#fn_1443.md) suffer, all the members suffer with
it,” “if one be honoured, all rejoice.”
