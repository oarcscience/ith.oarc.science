id="xiii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Letter XVII</span>.—*To Eustathia, Ambrosia,
and Basilissa* <span id="fr_2240"></span>[2242](#fn_2240.md) . *To the most
discreet and devout Sisters, Eustathia and Ambrosia, and to the most
discreet and noble Daughter, Basilissa, Gregory sends greeting in the
Lord.*

<span id="xiii.xviii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.xviii-p3.1"></span>The</span> meeting with the good and the
beloved, and the memorials of the immense love of the Lord for us men,
which are shown in your localities, have been the source to me of the
most intense joy and gladness. Doubly indeed have these shone upon
divinely festal days; both in beholding the saving tokens <span
id="fr_2241"></span>[2243](#fn_2241.md) of the God who gave us life, and in
meeting with souls in whom the tokens of the Lord’s grace are to be
discerned spiritually in such clearness, that one can believe that
Bethlehem and Golgotha, and Olivet, and the scene of the Resurrection
are really in the God-containing heart. For when through a good
conscience Christ has been formed in any, when any has by dint of godly
fear nailed down the promptings of the flesh and become crucified to
Christ, when any has rolled away from himself the heavy stone of this
world’s illusions, and coming forth from the grave of the body has begun
to walk as it were in a newness of life, abandoning this low-lying
valley of human life, and mounting with a soaring desire to that
heavenly country <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2244](#fn_2242.md) with all its
elevated thoughts, where Christ is, no longer feeling the body’s burden,
but lifting it by chastity, so that the flesh with cloud-like lightness
accompanies the ascending soul—such an one, in my opinion, is to be
counted in the number of those famous ones in whom the memorials of the
Lord’s love for us men are to be seen. When, then, I not only saw with
the sense of sight those Sacred Places, but I saw the tokens of places
like them, plain in yourselves as well, I was filled with joy so great
that the description of its blessing is beyond the power of utterance.
But because it is a difficult, not to say an impossible thing for a
human being to enjoy unmixed with evil any blessing, therefore something
of bitterness was mingled with the sweets I tasted: and by this, after
the enjoyment of those blessings, I was saddened in my journey back to
my native land, estimating now the truth of the Lord’s words, that “the
whole world lieth in wickedness <span
id="fr_2243"></span>[2245](#fn_2243.md) ,” so that no single part of the
inhabited earth is without its share of degeneracy. For if the spot
itself that has received the footprints of the very Life is not clear of
the wicked thorns, what are we to think of other places where communion
with the Blessing has been inculcated by hearing and preaching
alone <span id="fr_2244"></span>[2246](#fn_2244.md) . With what view I say
this, need not be explained more fully in words; facts themselves
proclaim more loudly than any speech, however intelligible, the
melancholy truth.

<span id="xiii.xviii-p8"></span>The Lawgiver of our life has enjoined
upon us one single hatred. I mean, that of the Serpent: for no other
purpose has He bidden us exercise this faculty of hatred, but as a
resource against wickedness. “I will put enmity,” He says, “between thee
and him.” Since wickedness is a complicated and multifarious thing, the
Word allegorizes it by the Serpent, the dense array of whose scales is
symbolic of this multiformity of evil. And we by working the will of our
Adversary make an alliance with this serpent, and so turn this hatred
against one another <span id="fr_2245"></span>[2247](#fn_2245.md) , and
perhaps not against ourselves alone, but against Him Who gave the
commandment; for He says, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine
enemy,” commanding us to hold the foe to our humanity as our only enemy,
and declaring that all who share that humanity are the neighbours of
each one of us. But this gross-hearted age has disunited us from our
neighbour, and has made us welcome the serpent, and revel in his spotted
scales <span id="fr_2246"></span>[2248](#fn_2246.md) . I affirm, then, that
it is a lawful thing to hate God’s enemies, and that this kind of hatred
is pleasing to our Lord: and by God’s enemies I mean those who deny the
glory of our Lord, be they Jews, or downright idolaters, or those who
through Arius’ teaching idolize the creature, and so adopt the error of
the Jews. Now when the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, are with
orthodox devotion being glorified and adored by those who believe that
in a distinct and unconfused Trinity there is One Substance, Glory,
Kingship, Power, and Universal Rule, in such a case as this what good
excuse for fighting can there be? At the time, certainly, when <span
id="page_543">p. 543</span> <span id="xiii.xviii-Page_543"></span>the
heretical views prevailed, to try issues with the authorities, by whom
the adversaries’ cause was seen to be strengthened, was well; there was
fear then lest our saving Doctrine should be over-ruled by human rulers.
But now, when over the whole world from one end of heaven to the other
the orthodox Faith is being preached, the man who fights with them who
preach it, fights not with them, but with Him Who is thus preached. What
other aim, indeed, ought that man’s to be, who has the zeal for God,
than in every possible way to announce the glory of God? As long, then,
as the Only-begotten is adored with all the heart and soul and mind,
believed to be in everything that which the Father is, and in like
manner the Holy Ghost is glorified with an equal amount of adoration,
what plausible excuse for fighting is left these over-refined
disputants, who are rending the seamless robe, and parting the Lord’s
name between Paul and Cephas, and undisguisedly abhorring contact with
those who worship Christ, all but exclaiming in so many words, “Away
from me, I am holy”?

<span id="xiii.xviii-p11"></span>Granting that the knowledge which they
believe themselves to have acquired is somewhat greater than that of
others: yet can they possess more than the belief that the Son of the
Very God is Very God, seeing that in that article of the Very God every
idea that is orthodox, every idea that is our salvation, is included? It
includes the idea of His Goodness, His Justice, His Omnipotence: that He
admits of no variableness nor alteration, but is always the same;
incapable of changing to worse or changing to better, because the first
is not His nature, the second He does not admit of; for what can be
higher than the Highest, what can be better than the Best? In fact, He
is thus associated with all perfection, and, as to every form of
alteration, is unalterable; He did not on occasions display this
attribute, but was always so, both before the Dispensation that made Him
man, and during it, and after it; and in all His activities in our
behalf He never lowered any part of that changeless and unvarying
character to that which was out of keeping with it. What is essentially
imperishable and changeless is always such; it does not follow the
variation of a lower order of things, when it comes by dispensation to
be there; just as the sun, for example, when he plunges his beam into
the gloom, does not dim the brightness of that beam; but instead, the
dark is changed by the beam into light; thus also the True Light,
shining in our gloom, was not itself overshadowed with that shade, but
enlightened it by means of itself. Well, seeing that our humanity was in
darkness, as it is written, “They know not, neither will they
understand, they walk on in darkness <span
id="fr_2247"></span>[2249](#fn_2247.md) ,” the Illuminator of this darkened
world darted the beam of His Divinity through the whole compound of our
nature, through soul, I say, and body too, and so appropriated humanity
entire by means of His own light, and took it up and made it just that
thing which He is Himself. And as this Divinity was not made perishable,
though it inhabited a perishable body, so neither did it alter in the
direction of any change, though it healed the changeful in our soul: in
medicine, too, the physician of the body, when he takes hold of his
patient, so far from himself contracting the disease, thereby perfects
the cure of the suffering part. Let no one, either, putting a wrong
interpretation on the words of the Gospel, suppose that our human nature
in Christ was transformed to something more divine by any gradations and
advance: for the increasing in stature and in wisdom and in favour, is
recorded in Holy Writ only to prove that Christ really was present in
the human compound, and so to leave no room for their surmise, who
propound that a phantom, or form in human outline, and not a real Divine
Manifestation, was there. It is for this reason that Holy Writ records
unabashed with regard to Him all the accidents of our nature, even
eating, drinking, sleeping, weariness, nurture, increase in bodily
stature, growing up—everything that marks humanity, except the tendency
to sin. Sin, indeed, is a miscarriage, not a quality of human nature:
just as disease and deformity are not congenital to it in the first
instance, but are its unnatural accretions, so activity in the direction
of sin is to be thought of as a mere mutilation of the goodness innate
in us; it is not found to be itself a real thing, but we see it only in
the absence of that goodness. Therefore He Who transformed the elements
of our nature into His divine abilities, rendered it secure from
mutilation and disease, because He admitted not in Himself the deformity
which sin works in the will. “He did no sin,” it says, “neither was
guile found in his mouth <span id="fr_2248"></span>[2250](#fn_2248.md) .”
And this in Him is not to be regarded in connection with any interval of
time: for at once the man in Mary (where Wisdom built her house), though
naturally part of our sensuous compound, along with the coming upon her
of the Holy Ghost, and her overshadowing with the power of the Highest,
became that which that overshadowing power in essence was: for, without
controversy, it is the Less that is blest by the Greater. Seeing, then,
that the power of the Godhead is an immense and immeasurable thing,
while man is a weak atom, at the moment when the Holy Ghost came upon
the Virgin, and the power of the Highest over<span id="page_544">p.
544</span> <span id="xiii.xviii-Page_544"></span>shadowed her, the
tabernacle formed by such an impulse was not clothed with anything of
human corruption; but, just as it was first constituted, so it remained,
even though it was man, Spirit nevertheless, and Grace, and Power; and
the special attributes of our humanity derived lustre from this
abundance of Divine Power <span id="fr_2249"></span>[2251](#fn_2249.md) .

<span id="xiii.xviii-p15"></span>There are indeed two limits of human
life: the one we start from, and the one we end in: and so it was
necessary that the Physician of our being should enfold us at both these
extremities, and grasp not only the end, but the beginning too, in order
to secure in both the raising of the sufferer. That, then, which we find
to have happened on the side of the finish we conclude also as to the
beginning. As at the end He caused by virtue of the Incarnation that,
though the body was disunited from the soul, yet the indivisible Godhead
which had been blended once for all with the subject (who possessed
them) was not stripped from that body any more than it was from that
soul, but while it was in Paradise along with the soul, and paved an
entrance there in the person of the Thief for all humanity, it remained
by means of the body in the heart of the earth, and therein destroyed
him that had the power of Death (wherefore His *body* too is called “the
Lord <span id="fr_2250"></span>[2252](#fn_2250.md) ” on account of that
inherent Godhead)—so also, at the beginning, we conclude that the power
of the Highest, coalescing with our entire nature by that coming upon
(the Virgin) of the Holy Ghost, both resides in our soul, so far as
reason sees it possible that it should reside there, and is blended with
our body, so that our salvation throughout every element may be perfect,
that heavenly passionlessness which is peculiar to the Deity being
nevertheless preserved both in the beginning and in the end of this life
as Man <span id="fr_2251"></span>[2253](#fn_2251.md) . Thus the beginning
was not as our beginning, nor the end as our end. Both in the one and in
the other He evinced His Divine independence; the beginning had no stain
of pleasure upon it, the end was not the end in dissolution.

<span id="xiii.xviii-p18"></span>Now if we loudly preach all this, and
testify to all this, namely that Christ is the power of God and the
wisdom of God, always changeless, always imperishable, though He comes
in the changeable and the perishable; never stained Himself, but making
clean that which is stained; what is the crime that we commit, and
wherefore are we hated? And what means this opposing array <span
id="fr_2252"></span>[2254](#fn_2252.md) of new Altars? Do we announce
another Jesus? Do we hint at another? Do we produce other scriptures?
Have any of ourselves dared to say “Mother of Man” of the Holy Virgin,
the Mother of God <span id="fr_2253"></span>[2255](#fn_2253.md) : which is
what we hear that some of them say without restraint? Do we romance
about three Resurrections <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2256](#fn_2254.md) ?
Do we promise the gluttony of the Millennium? Do we declare that the
Jewish animal-sacrifices shall be restored? Do we lower men’s hopes
again to the Jerusalem below, imagining its rebuilding with stones of a
more brilliant material? What charge like these can be brought against
us, that our company should be reckoned a thing to be avoided, and that
in some places another altar should be erected in opposition to us, as
if we should defile their sanctuaries? My heart was in a state of
burning indignation about this: and now that I have set foot in the
City <span id="fr_2255"></span>[2257](#fn_2255.md) again, I am eager to
unburden my soul of its bitterness, by appealing, in a letter, to your
love. Do ye, whithersoever the Holy Spirit shall lead you, there remain;
walk with God before you; confer not with flesh and blood; lend no
occasion to any of them for glorying, that they may not glory in you,
enlarging their ambition by anything in your lives. Remember the Holy
Fathers, into whose hands ye were commended by your Father now in
bliss <span id="fr_2256"></span>[2258](#fn_2256.md) , and to whom we <span
id="page_545">p. 545</span> <span id="xiii.xviii-Page_545"></span>by
God’s grace were deemed worthy to succeed and remove not the boundaries
which our Fathers have laid down, nor put aside in any way the plainness
of our simpler proclamation in favour of their subtler school. Walk by
the primitive rule of the Faith: and the God of peace shall be with you,
and ye shall be strong in mind and body. May God keep you uncorrupted,
is our prayer.

<span id="xiii.xviii-p2"></span> This Letter was published, Paris 1606,
by R. Stephens (not the great lexicographer), who also translated *On

<span id="xiii.xviii-p14"></span> Compare Gregory against Apollinaris
(*Ad Theophil.* iii. 265): “The first-fruits of humanity assumed by
omnipotent Deity were, like a drop of vinegar merged in a boundless
ocean, found still in that Deity, but not in their own distinctive
properties: otherwise we should be obliged to think of a duality of
Sons.” In *Orat. Cat.* c. 10, he says that the Divine nature is to be
conceived as having been so united with the human, as flame is with its
fuel, the former extending beyond the latter, as our souls also overstep
the limits of our bodies. The first of these passages appeared to Hooker
(V. liii. 2) to be “so plain and direct for Eutyches,” that he doubted
whether the words were Gregory’s. But at the Council of Ephesus, S.
Cyril (of Alexandria), in his contest with the Nestorians, had showed
that these expressions were capable of a Catholic interpretation, and
pardonable in discussing the difficult and mysterious question of the
union of the Two Natures.

<span id="xiii.xviii-p17"></span> “Here is the true vicariousness of the
Atonement, which consisted not in the substitution of His punishment for
ours, but in His offering the sacrifice which man had neither the purity
nor the power to offer. From out of the very heart or centre of human
nature…there is raised the sinless sacrifice of perfect humanity by the
God Man.…It is a representative sacrifice, for it consists of no
unheard-of experience, of no merely symbolic ceremony, but of just those
universal incidents of suffering, which, though he must have felt them
with a bitterness unknown to us, are intensely human.” *Lux Mundi,* p.

<span id="xiii.xviii-p23"></span> Basil, probably: who after Cyril’s
exile had been called in to heal the heresy of Apollinaris, which was
spreading in the convents at Jerusalem. The factious purism, however,
which Gregory deplores here, and which led to rival altars, seems to
have evinced itself amongst the orthodox themselves, “quo majorem apud
omnes opinionem de suâ præstantiâ belli isti cathari excitarent”
(Casaubon). Cyril, it is true, had returned this year, 382; and spent
the last years of his life in his see; but with more than twenty years
interval of Arian rule (Herennius, Heraclius, and Hilarius, according to
Sozomen) the communities of the Catholics must have suffered from want
of a constant control: and unity was always difficult to maintain in a
city frequented by all the ecclesiastics of the world. Gregory must have
“succeeded” to this charge in his visit to Jerusalem after the Council
of Antioch in 379, to which he refers in his letter *On Pilgrimages:*
but it is possible that he had paid even an earlier visit: see Letter
XIV. p. 539, note 5.
