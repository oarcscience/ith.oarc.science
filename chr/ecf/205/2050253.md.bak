<span id="xi.ii.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxv-p2.1"></span>For</span> when they have heard from us
something to this effect—that when the mortal passes into life it
follows necessarily that, as that first birth leads only to the
existence of mortality, another birth should be discovered, a birth
which neither begins nor ends with corruption, but one which conducts
the person begotten to an immortal existence, in order that, as what is
begotten of a mortal birth has necessarily a mortal subsistence, so from
a birth which admits not corruption that which is born may be superior
to the corruption of death; when, I say, they have heard this and the
like from us, and are besides instructed as to the process,—namely that
it is prayer and the invocation of heavenly grace, and water, and faith,
by which the mystery of regeneration is accomplished,—they still remain
incredulous and have an eye only for the outward and visible, as if that
which is operated corporeally <span id="fr_2018"></span>[2020](#fn_2018.md)
concurred not with the fulfilment of God’s promise. How, they ask, can
prayer and the invocation of Divine power over the water be the
foundation of life in those who have been thus initiated? In reply to
them, unless they be of a very obstinate disposition, one single
consideration suffices to bring them to an acquiescence in our doctrine.
For let us in our turn ask them about that process of the carnal
generation which every one can notice. How does that something which is
cast for the beginnings of the formation of a living being become a Man?
In that case, most certainly, there is no method whatever that can
discover for us, by any possible reasoning, even the probable truth. For
what correlation is there between the definition of man and the quality
observable in that something? Man, when once he is put together, is a
reasoning and intellectual being, capable of thought and knowledge; but
that something is to be observed only in its quality of humidity, and
the mind grasps nothing in it beyond that which is seen by the sense of
sight. The reply, therefore, which we might expect to receive from those
whom we questioned as to how it is credible that a man is compounded
from that humid element, is the very reply which we make when questioned
about the regeneration that takes place through the water. Now in that
other case any one so questioned has this reply ready at hand, that that
element becomes a man by a Divine power, wanting which, the element is
motionless and inoperative. If, therefore, in that instance the
subordinate matter does not make the man, but the Divine power changes
that visible thing into a man’s nature, it would be utterly unfair for
them, when in the one case they testify to such power in God, in this
other department to suppose that the Deity is too weak to accomplish His
will. What is there common, they ask, between water and life? What is
there common, we ask them in return, between humidity and God’s image?
In that case there is no paradox if, God so willing, what is humid
changes into the most rare creature <span
id="fr_2019"></span>[2021](#fn_2019.md) . Equally, then, in this case we
assert that there is nothing strange when the presence of a Divine
influence transforms what is born with a corruptible nature into a state
of incorruption.
