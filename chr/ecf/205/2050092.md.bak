<span id="viii.i.vi.ix"></span>

<span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p1"></span> §9. *Then, distinguishing between
essence and generation, he declares the empty and frivolous language of
Eunomius to be like a rattle. He proceeds to show that the language used
by the great Basil on the subject of the generation of the Only-begotten
has been grievously slandered by Eunomius, and so ends the book.*

<span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p2"></span>I will pass by these matters, however,
as the absurdity involved is evident; let us examine what precedes. He
says that nothing else is found, “besides the essence of the Son, which
admits of the generation.” What does he mean when he says this? He
distinguishes two names from each other, and separating by his discourse
the things signified by them, he sets each of them individually apart by
itself. “The generation” is one name, and “the essence” is another. The
essence, he tells us, “admits of the generation,” being therefore of
course something distinct from the generation. For if the generation
were the essence (which is the very thing he is constantly declaring),
so that the two appellations are equivalent in sense, he would not have
said that the essence “admits of the generation”: for that would amount
to saying that the essence admits of the essence, or the generation the
generation,—if, that is, the generation were the same thing as the
essence. He understands, then, the generation to be one thing, and the
essence to be another, which “admits of generation”: for that which is
taken cannot be the same with that which admits it. Well, this is what
the sage and systematic statement of our author says: but as to whether
there is any sense in his words, let him consider who is expert in
judging. I will resume his actual words.

<span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p3"></span>He says that he finds “nothing else
besides <span id="page_CLXX">p. CLXX</span> <span
id="viii.i.vi.ix-Page_CLXX"></span>the essence of the Son which admits
of the generation”; that there is no sense in his words however, is
clear to every one who hears his statement at all: the task which
remains seems to be to bring to light the blasphemy which he is trying
to construct by aid of these meaningless words. For he desires, even if
he cannot effect his purpose, to produce in his hearers by this
slackness of expression, the notion that the essence of the Son is the
result of construction: but he calls its construction “generation,”
decking out his horrible blasphemy with the fairest phrase, that if
“construction” is the meaning conveyed by the word “generation,” the
idea of the creation of the Lord may receive a ready assent. He says,
then, that the essence “admits of generation,” so that every
construction may be viewed, as it were, in some subject matter. For no
one would say that that is constructed which has no existence, so
extending “making” in his discourse, as if it were some constructed
fabric, to the nature of the Only-begotten God <span
id="fr_677"></span>[679](#fn_677.md) . “If, then,” he says, “it admits of
this generation,”—wishing to convey some such meaning as this, that it
would not have been, had it not been constructed. But what else is there
among the things we contemplate in the creation which *is* without being
made? Heaven, earth, air, sea, everything whatever that is, surely *is*
by being made. How, then, comes it that he considered it a peculiarity
in the nature of the Only begotten, that it “admits generation” (for
this is his name for making) “into its actual essence,” as though the
humble-bee or the gnat did not admit generation into itself <span
id="fr_678"></span>[680](#fn_678.md) , but into something else besides
itself. It is therefore acknowledged by his own writings, that by them
the essence of the Only-begotten is placed on the same level with the
smallest parts of the creation: and every proof by which he attempts to
establish the alienation of the Son from the Father has the same force
also in the case of individual things. What need has he, then, for this
varied acuteness to establish the diversity of nature, when he ought to
have taken the short cut of denial, by openly declaring that the name of
the Son ought not to be confessed, or the Only-begotten God to be
preached in the churches, but that we ought to esteem the Jewish worship
as superior to the faith of Christians, and, while we confess the Father
as being alone Creator and Maker of the world, to reduce all other
things to the name and conception of the creation, and among these to
speak of that work which preceded the rest as a “thing made,” which came
into being by some constructive operation, and to give Him the title of
“First created,” instead of Only-begotten and Very Son. For when these
opinions have carried the day, it will be a very easy matter to bring
doctrines to a conclusion in agreement with the aim they have in view,
when all are guided, as you might expect from such a principle, to the
consequence that it is impossible that He Who is neither begotten nor a
Son, but has His existence through some energy, should share in essence
with God. So long, however, as the declarations of the Gospel prevail,
by which He is proclaimed as “Son,” and “Only-begotten,” and “of the
Father,” and “of God,” and the like, Eunomius will talk his nonsense to
no purpose, leading himself and his followers astray by such idle
chatter. For while the title of “Son” speaks aloud the true relation to
the Father, who is so foolish that, while John and Paul and the rest of
the choir of the Saints proclaim these words,—words of truth, and words
that point to the close affinity,—he does not look to them, but is led
by the empty rattle of Eunomius’ sophisms to think that Eunomius is a
truer guide than the teaching of these who by the Spirit speak
mysteries <span id="fr_679"></span>[681](#fn_679.md) , and who bear Christ
in themselves? Why, who is this Eunomius? Whence was he raised up to be
the guide of Christians?

<span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p7"></span>But let all this pass, and let our
earnestness about what lies before us calm down our heart, that is
swollen with jealousy on behalf of the faith against the blasphemers.
For how is it possible not to be moved to wrath and hatred, while our
God, and Lord, and Life-giver, and Saviour is insulted by these wretched
men? If he had reviled my father according to the flesh, or been at
enmity with my benefactor, would it have been possible to bear without
emotion his anger against those I love? And if the Lord of my soul, Who
gave it being when it was not, and redeemed it when in bondage, and gave
me to taste of this present life, and prepared for me the life to come,
Who calls us to a kingdom, and gives us His commands that we may escape
the damnation of hell,—these are small things that I speak of, and not
worthy <span id="page_CLXXI">p. CLXXI</span> <span
id="viii.i.vi.ix-Page_CLXXI"></span>to express the greatness of our
common Lord—He that is worshipped by all creation, by things in heaven,
and things on earth, and things under the earth, by Whom stand the
unnumbered myriads of the heavenly ministers, to Whom is turned all that
is under rule here, and that has the desire of good—if He is exposed to
reviling by men, for whom it is not enough to associate themselves with
the party of the apostate, but who count it loss not to draw others by
their scribbling into the same gulf with themselves, that those who come
after may not lack a hand to lead them to destruction, is there any
one <span id="fr_680"></span>[682](#fn_680.md) who blames us for our anger
against these men? But let us return to the sequence of his discourse.

<span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p9"></span>He next proceeds once more to slander
us as dishonouring the generation of the Son by human similitudes, and
mentions what was written on these points by our father <span
id="fr_681"></span>[683](#fn_681.md) , where he says that while by the word
“Son” two things are signified, the being formed by passion, and the
true relationship to the begetter, he does not admit in discourses upon
things divine the former sense, which is unseemly and carnal, but in so
far as the latter tends to testify to the glory of the Only-begotten,
this alone finds a place in the sublime doctrines. Who, then, dishonours
the generation of the Son by human notions? He who sets far from the
Divine generation what belongs to passion and to man, and joins the Son
impassibly to Him that begat Him? or he who places Him Who brought all
things into being on a common level with the lower creation? Such an
idea, however, as it seems,—that of associating the Son in the majesty
of the Father,—this new wisdom seems to regard as dishonouring; while it
considers as great and sublime the act of bringing Him down to equality
with the creation that is in bondage with us. Empty complaints! Basil is
slandered as dishonouring the Son, who honours Him even as he honours
the Father <span id="fr_682"></span>[684](#fn_682.md) , and Eunomius is the
champion of the Only-begotten, who severs Him from the good nature of
the Father! Such a reproach Paul also once incurred with the Athenians,
being charged therewith by them as “a setter forth of strange gods <span
id="fr_683"></span>[685](#fn_683.md) ,” when he was reproving the wandering
among their gods of those who were mad in their idolatry, and was
leading them to the truth, preaching the resurrection by the Son. These
charges are now brought against Paul’s follower by the new Stoics and
Epicureans, who “spend their time in nothing else,” as the history says
of the Athenians, “but either to tell or to hear some new thing <span
id="fr_684"></span>[686](#fn_684.md) .” For what could be found newer than
this,—a Son of an energy, and a Father of a creature, and a new God
springing up from nothing, and good at variance with good? These are
they who profess to honour Him with due honour by saying that He is not
that which the nature of Him that begat Him is. Is Eunomius not ashamed
of the form of such honour, if one were to say that he himself is not
akin in nature to his father, but has community with something of
another kind? If he who brings the Lord of the creation into community
with the creation declares that he honours Him by so doing, let him also
himself be honoured by having community assigned him with what is brute
and senseless: but, if he finds community with an inferior nature hard
and insolent treatment, how is it honour for Him Who, as the prophet
saith, “ruleth with His power for ever <span
id="fr_685"></span>[687](#fn_685.md) ,” to be ranked with that nature which
is in subjection and bondage? But enough of this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_677"></span>[CLXX:679](2050092.htm#fr_677.md) <span
id="viii.i.vi.ix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p4"></span> This whole passage, as it stands in
Oehler’s text, (which has here been followed without alteration,) is
obscure: the connection between the clauses themselves is by no means
clear; and the general meaning of the passage, in view of the succeeding
sentences, seems doubtful. For it seems here to be alleged that Eunomius
considered the <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.vi.ix-p4.1"></span>κατασκεύη</span> to imply the previous
existence of some material, so to say, which was moulded by
generation—on the ground that no one would say that the essence, or
anything else, was constructed without being existent. On the other hand
it is immediately urged that this is just what would be said of all
created things. If the passage might be emended thus:—<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p4.2"></span>ἵ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p4.3"></span>ν᾽,</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p4.4"></span>ὥ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.vi.ix-p4.5"></span>σπερ ἐν ὑποκειμένῳ
τινὶ πράγματι πᾶσα κατασκεύη θεωρεῖται, (οὐ γὰρ ἄν τις ἔιποι
κατασκεύασθαι ὃ μὴ ὑφέστηκεν), οὕτως οἷον κατασκευάσματι τῇ τοῦ
μονογενοῦς φύσει προτείνῃ τῷ λόγῳ τὴν ποίησιν</span>—we should have a
comparatively clear sense—“in order that as all construction is observed
in some subject matter, (for no one would say that that is constructed
which has not existence) so he may extend the process of ‘making’ by his
argument to the nature of the Only-begotten God, as to some product of
construction.” The force of this would be, that Eunomius is really
employing the idea of “receiving generation,” to imply that the essence
of the Only-begotten is a <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.vi.ix-p4.6"></span>κατασκεύασμα</span>: and this, Gregory
says, puts him at once on a level with the physical creation.
