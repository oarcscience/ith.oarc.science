class="c9"><span id="viii.i.xiii.i-p1.1"></span>Book XI.</span>

<span id="viii.i.xiii.i-p2"></span>§1. *The eleventh book shows that the
title of “Good” is due, not to the Father alone, as Eunomius, the
imitator of Manichæus and Bardesanes, alleges, but to the Son also, Who
formed man in goodness and loving-kindness, and reformed him by His
Cross and Death.*

<span id="viii.i.xiii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="viii.i.xiii.i-p3.1"></span>Let</span> us now go on to the next stage
in his argument:—“….the Only-begotten Himself ascribing to the Father
the title due of right to Him alone. For He Who has taught us that the
appellation ‘good’ belongs to Him alone Who is the cause of His
own <span id="fr_970"></span>[972](#fn_970.md) goodness and of all
goodness, and is so at all times, and Who refers to Him all good that
has ever come into being, would be slow to appropriate to Himself the
authority over all things that have come into being, and the title of
‘the Existent.’” Well, so long as he concealed his blasphemy under some
kind of veil, and strove to entangle his deluded hearers unawares in the
mazes of his dialectic, I thought it necessary to watch his unfair and
clandestine dealings, and as far as possible to lay bare in my argument
the lurking mischief. But now that he has stripped his falsehood of
every mask that could disguise it, and publishes his profanity aloud in
categorical terms, I think it superfluous to undergo useless labour in
bringing logical modes of confutation to bear upon those who make no
secret of their impiety. For what further means could we discover to
demonstrate their malignity so efficacious as that which they themselves
show us in their writings ready to our hand? He says that the Father
alone is worthy of the title of “good,” that to Him alone such a name is
due, on the plea that even the Son Himself agrees that goodness belongs
to Him alone. Our accuser has pleaded our cause for us: for perhaps in
my former statements I was thought by my readers to show a certain
wanton insolence when I endeavoured to demonstrate that the fighters
against Christ made Him out to be alien from the goodness of the Father.
But I think it has now been proved by the confession of our opponents
that in bringing such a charge against them we were not acting unfairly.
For he who says that the title of “good” belongs of right to the Father
only, and that such an address befits Him alone, publishes abroad, by
thus disclosing his real meaning, the villainy which he had previously
wrapped up in disguise. He says that the title of “good” befits the
Father only. Does he mean the title with the signification which belongs
to the expression, or the title detached from its proper meaning? If on
the one side he merely ascribes to the Father the title of “good” in a
special sense, he is to be pitied for his irrationality in allowing to
the Father merely the sound of an empty name. But if he thinks that the
conception expressed by the term “good” belongs to God the Father only,
he is to be abominated for his impiety, reviving as he does the plague
of the Manichæan heresy in his own opinions. For as health and disease,
even so goodness and badness exist on terms of mutual destruction, so
that the absence of the one is the presence of the other. If then he
says that goodness belongs to the Father only, he cuts off these from
every conceivable object in existence except the Father, so that, along
with all, the Only-begotten God is shut out from good. For as he who
affirms that man alone is capable of laughter implies thereby that no
other animal shares this property, so he who asserts that good is in the
Father alone separates all things from that property. If then, as
Eunomius declares, the Father alone has by right the title of “good,”
such a term will not be properly applied to anything else. But every
impulse of the will either operates in accordance with good, or tends to
the contrary. For to be inclined neither one way nor the other, but to
remain in a state of equipoise, is the property of creatures inanimate
or insensible. If the Father alone is good, having goodness not as a
thing acquired, but in His nature, and if the Son, as heresy will have
it, does not share in the nature of the Father, then he who does not
share the good essence of the Father is of course at the same time
excluded also from part and lot in the title of “good.” But he who has
no claim either to the nature or <span id="page_CCXXXI">p. CCXXXI</span>
<span id="viii.i.xiii.i-Page_CCXXXI"></span>to the name of “good”—what
he is assuredly not unknown, even though I forbear the blasphemous
expression. For it is plain to all that the object for which Eunomius is
so eager is to import into the conception of the Son a suspicion of that
which is evil and opposite to good. For what kind of name belongs to him
who is not good is manifest to every one who has a share of reason. As
he who is not brave is cowardly, as he who is not just is unjust, and as
he who is not wise is foolish, so he who is not good clearly has as his
own the opposite name, and it is to this that the enemy of Christ wishes
to press the conception of the Only-begotten, becoming thereby to the
Church another Manes or Bardesanes. These are the sayings in regard of
which we say that our utterance would be no more effective than silence.
For were one to say countless things, and to arouse all possible
arguments, one could not say anything so damaging of our opponents as
what is openly and undisguisedly proclaimed by themselves. For what more
bitter charge could one invent against them for malice than that of
denying that He is good “Who, being in the form of God, thought it not
robbery to be equal with God <span id="fr_971"></span>[973](#fn_971.md) ,”
but yet condescended to the low estate of human nature, and did so
solely for the love of man? In return for what, tell me, “do ye thus
requite the Lord <span id="fr_972"></span>[974](#fn_972.md) ?” (for I will
borrow the language of Moses to the Israelites); is He not good, Who
when thou wast soulless dust invested thee with Godlike beauty, and
raised thee up as an image of His own power endowed with soul? Is He not
good, Who for thy sake took on Him the form of a servant, and for the
joy set before Him <span id="fr_973"></span>[975](#fn_973.md) did not
shrink from bearing the sufferings due to thy sin, and gave Himself a
ransom for thy death, and became for our sakes a curse and sin?

[Next: He also ingeniously shows from the passage of the Gospel which
speaks of “Good Master,” from the parable of the Vineyard, from Isaiah
and from Paul, that there is not a dualism in the Godhead of good and
evil, as Eunomius' ally Marcion supposes, and declares that the Son does
not refuse the title of “good” or “Existent,” or acknowledge His
alienation from the Father, but that to Him also belongs authority over
all things that come into being.](2050128.md)
