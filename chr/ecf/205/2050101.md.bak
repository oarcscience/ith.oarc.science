<span id="viii.i.viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.i.viii.ii-p1"></span> §2. *Then he again mentions S.
Peter’s word, “made,” and the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
which says that Jesus was made by God “an Apostle and High Priest”: and,
after giving a sufficient answer to the charges brought against him by
Eunomius, shows that Eunomius himself supports Basil’s arguments, and
says that the Only-begotten Son, when He had put on the flesh, became
Lord.*

<span id="viii.i.viii.ii-p2"></span>And although we make these remarks
in passing, the parenthetic addition seems, perhaps, not less important
than the main question before us. For since, when St. Peter says, “He
made Him Lord and Christ <span id="fr_759"></span>[761](#fn_759.md) ,” and
again, when the Apostle Paul says to the Hebrews that He made Him a
priest <span id="fr_760"></span>[762](#fn_760.md) , Eunomius catches at the
word “made” as being applicable to His pre-temporal existence, and
thinks thereby to establish his doctrine that the Lord is a thing
made <span id="fr_761"></span>[763](#fn_761.md) , let him now listen to
Paul when he says, “He made Him to be sin for us, Who knew not sin <span
id="fr_762"></span>[764](#fn_762.md) .” If he refers the word “made,” which
is used of the Lord in the passages from the Epistle to the Hebrews, and
from the words of Peter, to the pretemporal idea, he might fairly refer
the word in that passage which says that God made Him to be sin, to the
first existence of His essence, and try to show by this, as in the case
of his other testimonies, that he was “made”, so as to refer the word
“made” to the essence, acting consistently with himself, and to discern
sin in that essence. But if he shrinks from this by reason of its
manifest absurdity, and argues that, by saying, “He made Him to be sin,”
the Apostle indicates the dispensation of the last times, let him
persuade himself by the same train of reasoning that the word “made”
refers to that dispensation in the other passages also.

<span id="viii.i.viii.ii-p7"></span>Let us, however, return to the point
from which we digressed; for we might gather together from the same
Scripture countless other passages, besides those quoted, which bear
upon the matter. And let no one think that the divine Apostle is divided
against himself in contradiction, and affords by his own utterances
matter for their contentions on either side to those who dispute upon
the doctrines. For careful examination would find that his argument is
accurately directed to one aim; and he is not halting in his opinions:
for while he everywhere proclaims the combination of the Human with the
Divine, he none the less discerns in each its proper nature, in the
sense that while the human weakness is changed for the better by its
communion with the imperishable, the Divine power, on the other hand, is
not abased by its contact with the lowly form of nature. When therefore
he says, “He spared not His own Son,” he contrasts the true Son with the
other sons, begotten, or exalted, or <span id="page_CLXXXIV">p.
CLXXXIV</span> <span
id="viii.i.viii.ii-Page_CLXXXIV"></span>adopted <span
id="fr_763"></span>[765](#fn_763.md) (those, I mean, who were brought into
being at His command), marking the specialty of nature by the addition
of “own.” And, to the end that no one should connect the suffering of
the Cross with the imperishable nature, he gives in other words a fairly
distinct correction of such an error, when he calls Him “mediator
between God and men <span id="fr_764"></span>[766](#fn_764.md) ” and
“man <span id="fr_765"></span>[767](#fn_765.md) ,” and “God <span
id="fr_766"></span>[768](#fn_766.md) ,” that, from the fact that both are
predicated of the one Being, the fit conception might be entertained
concerning each Nature—concerning the Divine Nature, impassibility,
concerning the Human Nature, the dispensation of the Passion. As his
thought, then, divides that which in love to man was made one, but is
distinguished in idea, he uses, when he is proclaiming that nature which
transcends and surpasses all intelligence, the more exalted order of
names, calling Him “God over all <span id="fr_767"></span>[769](#fn_767.md)
,” “the great God <span id="fr_768"></span>[770](#fn_768.md) ,” “the power”
of God, and “the wisdom” of God <span id="fr_769"></span>[771](#fn_769.md)
, and the like; but when he is alluding to all that experience of
suffering which, by reason of our weakness, was necessarily assumed with
our nature, he gives to the union of the Natures <span
id="fr_770"></span>[772](#fn_770.md) that name which is derived from ours,
and calls Him Man, not by this word placing Him Whom he is setting forth
to us on a common level with the rest of nature, but so that orthodoxy
is protected as regards each Nature, in the sense that the Human Nature
is glorified by His assumption of it, and the Divine is not polluted by
Its condescension, but makes the Human element subject to sufferings,
while working, through Its Divine power, the resurrection of that which
suffered. And thus the experience of death is not <span
id="fr_771"></span>[773](#fn_771.md) referred to Him Who had communion in
our passible nature by reason of the union with Him of the Man, while at
the same time the exalted and Divine names descend to the Man, so that
He Who was manifested upon the Cross is called even “the Lord of
glory <span id="fr_772"></span>[774](#fn_772.md) ,” since the majesty
implied in these names is transmitted from the Divine to the Human by
the commixture of Its Nature with that Nature which is lowly. For this
cause he describes Him in varied and different language, at one time as
Him Who came down from heaven, at another time as Him Who was born of
woman, as God from eternity, and Man in the last days; thus too the
Only-begotten God is held to be impassible, and Christ to be capable of
suffering; nor does his discourse speak falsely in these opposing
statements, as it adapts in its conceptions to each Nature the terms
that belong to it. If then these are the doctrines which we have learnt
from inspired teaching, how do we refer the cause of our salvation to an
ordinary man? and if we declare the word “made” employed by the blessed
Peter to have regard not to the pre-temporal existence, but to the new
dispensation of the Incarnation, what has this to do with the charge
against us? For this great Apostle says that that which was seen in the
form of the servant has been made, by being assumed, to be that which He
Who assumed it was in His own Nature. Moreover, in the Epistle to the
Hebrews we may learn the same truth from Paul, when he says that Jesus
was made an Apostle and High Priest by God, “being faithful to him that
made Him so <span id="fr_773"></span>[775](#fn_773.md) .” For in that
passage too, in giving the name of High Priest to Him Who made with His
own Blood the priestly propitiation for our sins, he does not by the
word “made” declare the first existence of the Only-begotten, but says
“made” with the intention of representing that grace which is commonly
spoken of in connection with the appointment of priests. For Jesus, the
great High Priest (as Zechariah says <span
id="fr_774"></span>[776](#fn_774) .md), Who offered up his own lamb, that
is, His own Body, for the sin of the world; Who, by reason of the
children that are partakers of flesh and blood, Himself also in like
manner took part with them in blood <span
id="fr_775"></span>[777](#fn_775.md) (not in that He was in the beginning,
being the Word and God, and being in the form of God, and equal with
God, but in that He emptied Himself in the form of the servant, and
offered an oblation and sacrifice for us), He, I say, became a High
Priest many generations later, after the order of Melchisedech <span
id="fr_776"></span>[778](#fn_776.md) . Surely a reader who has more than a
casual acquaintance with the discourse to the Hebrews knows the mystery
of this matter. As, then, in that passage He is said to have been made
Priest and Apostle, so here He is said to have been made Lord and
Christ,—the latter for the dispensation on our behalf, the former by the
change and transformation of the Human to the Divine (for by “making”
the Apostle means “making anew”). Thus is manifest the knavery of our
adversaries, who insolently wrest the words referring to the
dispensation to apply them to the pretemporal existence. For we learn
from the Apostle not to know Christ in the same manner now as before, as
Paul thus speaks, “Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet
now know we Him no more <span id="fr_777"></span>[779](#fn_777.md) ,” in
the sense that the one knowledge manifests <span id="page_CLXXXV">p.
CLXXXV</span> <span id="viii.i.viii.ii-Page_CLXXXV"></span>to us His
temporary dispensation, the other His eternal existence. Thus our
discourse has made no inconsiderable answer to his charges:—that we
neither hold two Christs nor two Lords, that we are not ashamed of the
Cross, that we do not glorify a mere man as having suffered for the
world, that we assuredly do not think that the word “made” refers to the
formation of the essence. But, such being our view, our argument has no
small support from our accuser himself, where in the midst of his
discourse he employs his tongue in a flourishing onslaught upon us, and
produces this sentence among others: “This, then, is the conflict that
Basil wages against himself, and he clearly appears neither to have
‘applied his own mind to the intention of the Apostles,’ nor to be able
to preserve the sequence of his own arguments; for according to them he
must, if he is conscious of their irreconcilable character, admit that
the Word Who was in the beginning and was God became Lord,” or he fits
together “statements that are mutually conflicting.” Why, this is
actually our statement which Eunomius repeats, who says that “the Word
that was in the beginning and was God became Lord.” For, being what He
was, God, and Word, and Life, and Light, and Grace, and Truth, and Lord,
and Christ, and every name exalted and Divine, He did become, in the Man
assumed by Him, Who was none of these, all else which the Word was and
among the rest did become Lord and Christ, according to the teaching of
Peter, and according to the confession of Eunomius;—not in the sense
that the Godhead acquired anything by way of advancement, but (all
exalted majesty being contemplated in the Divine Nature) He thus becomes
Lord and Christ, not by arriving at any addition of grace in respect of
His Godhead (for the Nature of the Godhead is acknowledged to be lacking
in no good), but by bringing the Human Nature to that participation in
the Godhead which is signified by the terms “Christ” and “Lord.”

[Next: He then gives a notable explanation of the saying of the Lord to
Philip, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;” and herein he
excellently discusses the suffering of the Lord in His love to man, and
the impassibility, creative power, and providence of the Father, and the
composite nature of men, and their resolution into the elements of which
they were composed.](2050102.md)
