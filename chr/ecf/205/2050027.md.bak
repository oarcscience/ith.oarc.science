<span id="viii.i.iii.xi-p1"></span> §11. *The sophistry which he employs
to prove our acknowledgment that he had been tried, and that the
confession of his faith had not been unimpeached, is feeble.*

<span id="viii.i.iii.xi-p2"></span>He objects to sophistries in others;
see the sort of care he takes himself that his proofs shall be real
ones. Our Master said, in the book which he addressed to him, that at
the time when our cause was ruined, Eunomius won Cyzicus as the prize of
his blasphemy. What then does this detector of sophistry do? He fastens
at once on that word *prize,* and declares that we on our side confess
that he made an apology, that he won thereby, that he gained the prize
of victory by these efforts; and he frames his argument into a syllogism
consisting as he thinks of unanswerable propositions. But we will quote
word for word what he has written. ‘If a prize is the recognition and
the crown of victory, and a trial implies a victory, and, as also
inseparable from itself, an accusation, then that man who grants (in
argument) the prize must necessarily allow that there was a defence.’
What then is our answer to that? We do not deny that he fought this
wretched battle of impiety with a most vigorous energy, and that he went
a very long distance beyond his fellows in these perspiring efforts
against the truth; but we will not allow that he obtained the victory
over his opponents; but only that as compared with those who were
running the same as himself through heresy into error he was foremost in
the number of his lies and so gained the prize of Cyzicus in return for
high attainments in evil, beating all who for the same prize combated
the Truth; and that for this victory of blasphemy his name was blazoned
loud and clear when <span id="page_XLVII">p. XLVII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xi-Page_XLVII"></span>Cyzicus was selected for him by the
umpires of his party as the reward of his extravagance. This is the
statement of our opinion, and this we allowed; our contention now that
Cyzicus was the prize of a heresy, not the successful result of a
defence, shews it. Is this anything like his own mess of childish
sophistries, so that he can thereby hope to have grounds for proving the
fact of his trial and his defence? His method is like that of a man in a
drinking bout, who has made away with more strong liquor than the rest,
and having then claimed the pool from his fellow-drunkards should
attempt to make this victory a proof of having won some case in the law
courts. That man might chop the same sort of logic. ‘If a prize is the
recognition and the crown of victory, and a law-trial implies a victory
and, as also inseparable from itself, an accusation, then I have won my
suit, since I have been crowned for my powers of drinking in this bout.’

<span id="viii.i.iii.xi-p3"></span>One would certainly answer to such a
boaster that a trial in court is a very different thing from a
wine-contest, and that one who wins with the glass has thereby no
advantage over his legal adversaries, though he get a beautiful chaplet
of flowers. No more, therefore, has the man who has beaten his equals in
the advocacy of profanity anything to show in having won the prize for
that, that he has won a verdict too. The testimony on our side that he
is first in profanity is no plea for his imaginary ‘apology.’ If he did
speak it before the court, and, having so prevailed over his
adversaries, was honoured with Cyzicus for that, then he might have some
occasion for using our own words against ourselves; but as he is
continually protesting in his book that he yielded to the animus of the
voters, and accepted in silence the penalty which they inflicted, not
even waiting for this hostile decision, why does he impose upon himself
and make this word *prize* into the proof of a successful apology? Our
excellent friend fails to understand the force of this word *prize;*
Cyzicus was given up to him as the reward of merit for his extravagant
impiety; and as it was his will to receive such a prize, and he views it
in the light of a victor’s guerdon, let him receive as well what that
victory implies, viz. the lion’s share in the guilt of profanity. If he
insists on our own words against ourselves, he must accept both these
consequences, or neither.
