<span id="xiii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.ix-p1.1"></span>Letter VIII <span
id="fr_2184"></span>[2186](#fn_2184.md) </span>.—*To a Student of the
Classics*.

<span id="xiii.ix-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.ix-p3.1"></span>When</span> I was looking for some suitable and
proper exordium, I mean of course from Holy Scripture, to put at the
head of my letter, according to my usual custom, I did not know which to
choose, not from inability to find what was suitable, but because I
deemed it superfluous to write such things to those who knew nothing
about the matter. For your eager pursuit of profane literature proved
incontestably to us that you did not care about sacred. Accordingly I
will say nothing about Bible texts, but will select a prelude adapted to
your literary tastes taken from the poets you love so well. By the great
master of your education there is introduced one, showing all an old
man’s joy, when after long affliction he once more beheld his son, and
his son’s son as well. <span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span
id="xiii.ix-Page_532"></span>And the special theme of his exultation is
the rivalry between the two, Ulysses and Telemachus, for the highest
meed of valour, though it is true that the recollection of his own
exploits against the Cephallenians adds to the point of his speech <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2187](#fn_2185.md) . For you and your admirable
father, when you welcomed me, as they did Laertes, in your affection,
contended in most honourable rivalry for the prize of virtue, by showing
us all possible respect and kindness; he in numerous ways which I need
not here mention, and you by pelting me with <span
id="fr_2186"></span>[2188](#fn_2186.md) your letters from Cappadocia. What,
then, of me the aged one? I count that day one to be blessed, in which I
witness such a competition between father and son. May you, then, never
cease from accomplishing the rightful prayer of an excellent and
admirable father, and surpassing in your readiness to all good works the
renown which from him you inherit. I shall be a judge acceptable to both
of you, as I shall award you the first prize against your father, and
the same to your father against you. And we will put up with rough
Ithaca, rough not so much with stones as with the manners of the
inhabitants, an island in which there are many suitors, who are
suitors <span id="fr_2187"></span>[2189](#fn_2187.md) most of all for the
possessions of her whom they woo, and insult their intended bride by
this very fact, that they threaten her chastity with marriage, acting in
a way worthy of a Melantho, one might say, or some other such person;
for nowhere is there a Ulysses to bring them to their senses with his
bow. You see how in an old man’s fashion I go maundering off into
matters with which you have no concern. But pray let indulgence be
readily extended to me in consideration of my grey hairs; for garrulity
is just as characteristic of old age as to be blear-eyed, or for the
limbs to fail <span id="fr_2188"></span>[2190](#fn_2188.md) . But you by
entertaining us with your brisk and lively language, like a bold young
man as you are, will make our old age young again, supporting the
feebleness of our length of days with this kind attention which so well
becomes you.

<span id="fn_2184"></span>[531:2186](2050274.htm#fr_2184.md) <span
id="xiii.ix-p1.2"></span>

<span id="xiii.ix-p2"></span> Perhaps to Eupatrius (Cod. Medic.).

<span id="fn_2185"></span>[532:2187](2050274.htm#fr_2185.md) <span
id="xiii.ix-p3.2"></span>

<span id="xiii.ix-p4"></span> The text here seems hopelessly corrupt. Or
the meaning may be, “Our main text shall be his exultation at the
generous rivalry between Ulysses and Telemachus, though his mention of
his exploits against the Cephallenians shall also contribute to
illustrate our discussion;” but this can hardly be got out of the Greek.
The reference is to *Odyssey,* xxiv. 514. Gregory was evidently fond of
Homer: the comparison of Diomede to a winter torrent (*Iliad,* v. 87) is
used *De Virginit.* c. 4: and Menelaus’ words about the young and old
(*Iliad,* iii. 108), c. 23: and in Letter II. of the seven edited by
Caraccioli (Letter XV.) describing the gardens of Vanota, *Od.* vii.
115, xiii. 589. For other quotations from the classics see Letters XI.
and XII. of this Series (H. C. O.).

<span id="fn_2186"></span>[532:2188](2050274.htm#fr_2186.md) <span
id="xiii.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ix-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ix-p5.1"></span>βάλλοντες</span>, with allusion to the darts
hurled by Ulysses and Telemachus (H. C. O.).

<span id="fn_2187"></span>[532:2189](2050274.htm#fr_2187.md) <span
id="xiii.ix-p5.2"></span>

<span id="xiii.ix-p6"></span> Reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ix-p6.1"></span>μνηστῆρες</span>, for the unmeaning <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiii.ix-p6.2"></span>κρατῆρες</span>; “they are
suitors not so much for the hand of Penelope as for her money” (H. C.
O.). The Medicean has <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ix-p6.3"></span>βρωστῆρες</span>, “devourers.” Just below the
allusion is to Melantho’s rudely threatening Ulysses, and getting hanged
for it.

<span id="fn_2188"></span>[532:2190](2050274.htm#fr_2188.md) <span
id="xiii.ix-p6.4"></span>

<span id="xiii.ix-p7"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ix-p7.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ix-p7.2"></span>πὸ τῆς τοῦ γήρως ἀπονοίας</span>, an irrelevant
phrase, and, as not necessary to the sense, here omitted in translation
(H. C. O.).
