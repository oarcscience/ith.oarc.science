<span id="viii.i.vi.v-p1"></span> §5. *He again shows Eunomius,
constrained by truth, in the character of an advocate of the orthodox
doctrine, confessing as most proper and primary, not only the essence of
the Father, but the essence also of the Only-begotten.*

<span id="viii.i.vi.v-p2"></span>It might, however, be useful to look at
the sense of the utterance of Eunomius that is set before us in orderly
sequence, recurring to the beginning of his statement. For the points we
have now examined were an obvious incitement to us to begin our reply
with the last passage, on account of the evident character of the
contradiction involved in his words.

<span id="viii.i.vi.v-p3"></span>This, then, is what Eunomius says at
the beginning:—

<span id="viii.i.vi.v-p4"></span><span id="page_CLXII">p. CLXII</span>
<span id="viii.i.vi.v-Page_CLXII"></span>“Now, as these things are thus
divided, one might reasonably say that the most proper and primary
essence, and that which alone exists by the operation of the Father,
admits for itself the appellations of ‘product of generation,’ ‘product
of making,’ and ‘product of creation.’” First, then, I would ask those
who are attending to this discourse to bear in mind, that in his first
composition he says that the essence of the Father also is “most
proper,” introducing his statement with these words, “The whole account
of our teaching is completed with the supreme and most proper essence.”
And here he calls the essence of the Only-begotten “most proper and
primary.” Thus putting together Eunomius’ phrases from each of his
books, we shall call him himself as a witness of the community of
essence, who in another place makes a declaration to this effect, that
“of things which have the same appellations, the nature also is not
different” in any way. For our self-contradictory friend would not
indicate things differing in nature by identity of appellation, but it
is surely for this reason, that the definition of essence in Father and
Son is one, that he says that the one is “most proper,” and that the
other also is “most proper.” And the general usage of men bears witness
to our argument, which does not apply the term “most proper” where the
name does not truly agree with the nature. For instance, we call a
likeness, inexactly, “a man,” but what we properly designate by this
name is the animal presented to us in nature. And similarly, the
language of Scripture recognizes the appellation of “god” for an idol,
and for a demon, and for the belly: but here too the name has not its
proper sense; and in the same way with all other cases. A man is said to
have eaten food in the fancy of a dream, but we cannot call this fancy
food, in the proper sense of the term. As, then, in the case of two men
existing naturally, we properly call both equally by the name of man,
while if any one should join an inanimate portrait in his enumeration
with a real man, one might perhaps speak of him who really exists and of
the likeness, as “two men,” but would no longer attribute to both the
proper meaning of the word, so, on the supposition that the nature of
the Only-begotten was conceived as something else than the essence of
the Father, our author would not have called each of the essences “most
proper.” For how could any one signify things differing in nature by
identity of names? Surely the truth seems to be made plain even by those
who fight against it, as falsehood is unable, even when expressed in the
words of the enemy, utterly to prevail over truth. Hence the doctrine of
orthodoxy is proclaimed by the mouth of its opponents, without their
knowing what they say, as the saving Passion of the Lord for us had been
foretold in the case of Caiaphas, not knowing what he said <span
id="fr_646"></span>[648](#fn_646.md) . If, therefore, true propriety of
essence is common to both (I mean to the Father and the Son), what room
is there for saying that their essences are mutually divergent? Or how
is a difference by way of superior power, or greatness, or honour,
contemplated in them, seeing that the “most proper” essence admits of no
diminution? For that which is whatever it is imperfectly, is not that
thing “most properly,” be it nature, or power, or rank, or any other
individual object of contemplation, so that the superiority of the
Father’s essence, as heresy will have it, proves the imperfection of the
essence of the Son. If then it is imperfect, it is not proper; but if it
is “most proper” it is also surely perfect. For it is not possible to
call that which is deficient perfect. But neither is it possible, when,
in comparing them, that which is perfect is set beside that which is
perfect, to perceive any difference by way of excess or defect: for
perfection is one in both cases, as in a rule, not showing a hollow by
defect, nor a projection by excess. Thus, from these passages Eunomius’
advocacy in favour of our doctrine may be sufficiently seen—I should
rather say, not his earnestness on our behalf, but his conflict with
himself. For he turns against himself those devices whereby he
establishes our doctrines by his own arguments. Let us, however, once
more follow his writings word for word, that it may be clear to all that
their argument has no power for evil except the desire to do mischief.

[Next: He then exposes argument about the “Generate,” and the “product
of making,” and “product of creation,” and shows the impious nature of
the language of Eunomius and Theognostus on the “immediate” and
“undivided” character of the essence, and its “relation to its creator
and maker.”](2050089.md)
