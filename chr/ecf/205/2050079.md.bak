<span id="viii.i.v.iv"></span>

<span id="viii.i.v.iv-p1"></span> §4. *He thus shows the oneness of the
Eternal Son with the Father the identity of essence and the community of
nature (wherein is a natural inquiry into the production of wine), and
that the terms “Son” and “product” in the naming of the Only-Begotten
include a like idea of relationship.*

<span id="viii.i.v.iv-p2"></span>What has been said, therefore, has
clearly exposed the slackness which is to be found in the knavery of our
author, who, while he goes about to establish the opposition of the
essence of the Only-begotten to that of the Father, by the method of
calling the one “ungenerate,” and the other “generate,” stands convicted
of playing the fool with his inconsistent arguments. For it was shown
from his own words, first, that the name of “essence” means one thing,
and that of “generation” another; and next, that there did not come into
existence, with the Son, any new and different essence besides the
essence of the Father, but that what the Father is as regards the
definition of His nature, that also He is Who is of the Father, as the
nature does not change into diversity in the Person of the Son, <span
id="page_CXLV">p. CXLV</span> <span
id="viii.i.v.iv-Page_CXLV"></span>according to the truth of the argument
displayed by our consideration of Adam and Abel. For as, in that
instance, he that was not generated after a like sort was yet, so far as
concerns the definition of essence, the same with him that was
generated, and Abel’s generation did not produce any change in the
essence, so, in the case of these pure doctrines, the Only-begotten God
did not, by His own generation, produce in Himself any change in the
essence of Him Who is ungenerate (coming forth, as the Gospel says, from
the Father, and being in the Father,) but is, according to the simple
and homely language of the creed we profess, “Light of Light, very God
of very God,” the one being all that the other is, save being that
other. With regard, however, to the aim for the sake of which he carries
on this system-making, I think there is no need for me at present to
express any opinion, whether it is audacious and dangerous, or a thing
allowable and free from danger, to transform the phrases which are
employed to signify the Divine nature from one to another, and to call
Him Who is generated by the name of “product of generation.”

<span id="viii.i.v.iv-p3"></span>I let these matters pass, that my
discourse may not busy itself too much in the strife against lesser
points, and neglect the greater; but I say that we ought carefully to
consider the question whether the natural relation does introduce the
use of these terms: for this surely Eunomius asserts, that with the
affinity of the appellations there is also asserted an essential
relationship. For he would not say, I presume, that the mere names
themselves, apart from the sense of the things signified, have any
mutual relation or affinity; but all discern the relationship or
diversity of the appellations by the meanings which the words express.
If, therefore, he confesses that “the Son” has a natural relation with
“the Father,” let us leave the appellations, and consider the force that
is found in their significations, whether in their affinity we discern
diversity of essence, or that which is kindred and characteristic. To
say that we find diversity is downright madness. For how does something
without kinship or community “preserve order,” connected and
conformable, in the names, where “the generated essence itself,” as he
says, “and the appellation of ‘Son,’ make such a relation of words
appropriate”? If, on the other hand, he should say that these
appellations signify relationship, he will necessarily appear in the
character of an advocate of the community of essence, and as maintaining
the fact that by affinity of names is signified also the connection of
subjects: and this he often does in his composition without being aware
of it <span id="fr_577"></span>[579](#fn_577.md) . For, by the arguments
wherewith he endeavours to destroy the truth, he is often himself
unwittingly drawn into an advocacy of the very doctrines against which
he is contending. Some such thing the history tells us concerning Saul,
that once, when moved with wrath against the prophets, he was overcome
by grace, and was found as one of the inspired, (the Spirit of prophecy
willing, as I suppose, to instruct the apostate by means of himself,)
whence the surprising nature of the event became a proverb in his after
life, as the history records such an expression by way of wonder, “Is
Saul also among the prophets <span id="fr_578"></span>[580](#fn_578.md) ?”

<span id="viii.i.v.iv-p6"></span>At what point, then, does Eunomius
assent to the truth? When he says that the Lord Himself, “being the Son
of the living God, not being ashamed of His birth from the Virgin, often
named Himself, in His own sayings, ‘the Son of Man’”? For this phrase we
also allege for proof of the community of essence, because the name of
“Son” shows the community of nature to be equal in both cases. For as He
is called the Son of Man by reason of the kindred of His flesh to her of
whom He was born, so also He is conceived, surely, as the Son of God, by
reason of the connection of His essence with that from which He has His
existence, and this argument is the greatest weapon of the truth. For
nothing so clearly points to Him Who is the “mediator between God and
man <span id="fr_579"></span>[581](#fn_579.md) ” (as the great Apostle
called Him), as the name of “Son,” equally applicable to either nature,
Divine or Human. For the same Person is Son of God, and was made, in the
Incarnation, Son of Man, that, by His communion with each, He might link
together by Himself what were divided by nature. Now if, in becoming Son
of Man, he were without participation in human nature, it would be
logical to say that neither does He share in the Divine essence, though
He is Son of God. But if the whole compound nature of man was in Him
(for He was “in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
sin” <span id="fr_580"></span>[582](#fn_580) .md), it is surely necessary
to believe that every property of the transcendent essence is also in
Him, as the Word “Son” claims for Him both alike—the Human in the man,
but in the God the Divine.

<span id="viii.i.v.iv-p9"></span>If then the appellations, as Eunomius
says, indicate relationship, and the existence of relationship is
observed in the things, not in the mere sound of the words (and by
things I mean the things conceived in themselves, if it be not over-bold
thus to speak of the Son and the Father), who would deny that the very
champion of blasphemy has by his own action been dragged into the
advocacy of orthodoxy, overthrowing by his own means his own arguments,
and pro<span id="page_CXLVI">p. CXLVI</span> <span
id="viii.i.v.iv-Page_CXLVI"></span>claiming community of essence in the
case of the Divine doctrines? For the argument that he unwillingly casts
into the scale on the side of truth does not speak falsely as regards
this point,—that He would not have been called Son if the natural
conception of the names did not verify this calling. For as a bench is
not called the son of the workman, and no sane man would say that the
builder engendered the house, and we do not say that the vineyard is the
“product <span id="fr_581"></span>[583](#fn_581.md) ” of the vine-dresser,
but call what a man makes his work, and him who is begotten of him the
son of a man, (in order, I suppose, that the proper meaning might be
attached by means of the names to the respective subjects,) so too, when
we are taught that the Only-begotten is Son of God, we do not by this
appellation understand a creature of God, but what the word “Son” in its
signification really displays. And even though wine be named by
Scripture the “product <span id="fr_582"></span>[584](#fn_582.md) ” of the
vine, not even so will our argument with regard to the orthodox doctrine
suffer by this identity of name. For we do not call wine the “product”
of the oak, nor the acorn the “product” of the vine, but we use the word
only if there is some natural community between the “product” and that
from which it comes. For the moisture in the vine, which is drawn out
from the root through the stem by the pith, is, in its natural power,
water: but, as it passes in orderly sequence along the ways of nature,
and flows from the lowest to the highest, it changes to the quality of
wine, a change to which the rays of the sun contribute in some degree,
which by their warmth draw out the moisture from the depth to the
shoots, and by a proper and suitable process of ripening make the
moisture wine: so that, so far as their nature is concerned, there is no
difference between the moisture that exists in the vine and the wine
that is produced from it. For the one form of moisture comes from the
other, and one could not say that the cause of wine is anything else
than the moisture which naturally exists in the shoots. But, so far as
moisture is concerned, the differences of quality produce no alteration,
but are found when some peculiarity discerns the moisture which is in
the form of wine from that which is in the shoots, one of the two forms
being accompanied by astringency, or sweetness, or sourness, so that in
substance the two are the same, but are distinguished by qualitative
differences. As, therefore, when we hear from Scripture that the
Only-begotten God is Son of man, we learn by the kindred expressed in
the name His kinship with true man, so even, if the Son be called, in
the adversaries’ phrase, a “product,” we none the less learn, even by
this name, His kinship in essence with Him that has “produced <span
id="fr_583"></span>[585](#fn_583.md) ” Him, by the fact that wine, which is
called the “product” of the vine has been found not to be alien, as
concerns the idea of moisture, from the natural power that resides in
the vine. Indeed, if one were judiciously to examine the things that are
said by our adversaries, they tend to our doctrine, and their sense
cries out against their own fabrications, as they strive at all points
to establish their “difference in essence.” Yet it is by no means an
easy matter to conjecture whence they were led to such conceptions. For
if the appellation of “Son” does not merely signify “being from
something,” but by its signification presents to us specially, as
Eunomius himself says, relationship in point of nature, and wine is not
called the “product” of an oak, and those “products” or “generation of
vipers <span id="fr_584"></span>[586](#fn_584.md) ,” of which the Gospel
somewhere speaks, are snakes and not sheep, it is clear, that in the
case of the Only-begotten also, the appellation of “Son” or of “product”
would not convey the meaning of relationship to something of another
kind: but even if, according to our adversaries’ phrase, He is called a
“product of generation,” and the name of “Son,” as they confess, has
reference to nature, the Son is surely of the essence of Him Who has
generated or “produced” Him, not of that of some other among the things
which we contemplate as external to that nature. And if He is truly from
Him, He is not alien from all that belongs to Him from Whom He is, as in
the other cases too it was shown that all that has its existence from
anything by way of generation is clearly of the same kind as that from
whence it came.
