<span id="xiii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.viii-p1.1"></span>Letter VII</span>.—*To a Friend*.

<span id="xiii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.viii-p2.1"></span>What</span> flower in spring is so bright,
what voices of singing birds are so sweet, what breezes that soothe the
calm sea are so light and mild, what glebe is so fragrant to the
husbandman—whether it be teeming with green blades, or waving with
fruitful ears as is the spring of the soul, lit up with your peaceful
beams, from the radiance which shone in your letter, which raised our
life from despondency to gladness? For thus, perhaps, it will not be
unfitting to adapt the word of the prophet to our present blessings: “In
the multitude of the sorrows which I had in my heart, the comforts of
God,” by your kindness, “have refreshed my soul,” <span
id="fr_2181"></span>[2183](#fn_2181.md) like sunbeams, cheering and warming
our life nipped by frost. For both reached the highest pitch—the
severity of my troubles, I mean, on the one side, and the sweetness of
your favours on the other. And if you have so gladdened us, by only
sending us the joyful tidings of your coming, that everything changed
for us from extremest woe to a bright condition, what will your precious
and benign coming, even the sight of it, do? what consolation will the
sound of your sweet voice in our ears afford our soul? May this speedily
come to pass, by the good help of God, Who giveth respite from pain to
the fainting, and rest to the afflicted. But be assured, that when we
look at our own case we grieve exceedingly at the present state of
things, and men cease not to tear us in pieces <span
id="fr_2182"></span>[2184](#fn_2182.md) : but when we turn our eyes to your
excellence, we own that we have great cause for thankfulness to the
dispensation of Divine Providence, that we are able to enjoy in your
neighbourhood <span id="fr_2183"></span>[2185](#fn_2183.md) your sweetness
and good-will towards us, and feast at will on such food to satiety, if
indeed there is such a thing as satiety of blessings like these.
