<span id="x.ii.ii.xi-p1"></span> X. *That the mind works by means of the
senses.*

<span id="x.ii.ii.xi-p2"></span>1. As the mind then produces the music
of reason by means of our instrumental construction, we are born
rational, while, as I think, we should not have had the gift of reason
if we had had to employ our lips to supply the need of the body—the
heavy and toilsome part of the task of providing food. As things are,
however, our hands appropriate this ministration to themselves, and
leave the mouth available for the service of reason.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xi-p3"></span>2 <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1621](#fn_1619.md) . The operation of the
instrument <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1622](#fn_1620.md) , however, is
twofold; one for the production of sound, the other for the reception of
concepts from without; and the one faculty does not blend with the
other, but abides in the operation for which it was appointed by nature,
not interfering with its neighbour either by the sense of hearing
undertaking to speak, or by the speech undertaking to hear; for the
latter is always uttering something, while the ear, as Solomon somewhere
says, is not filled with continual hearing <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1623](#fn_1621.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xi-p7"></span>3. That point as to our internal
faculties which seems to me to be even in a special degree matter for
wonder, is this:—what is the extent of that inner receptacle into which
flows everything that is poured in by our hearing? who are the recorders
of the sayings that are brought in by it? what sort of storehouses are
there for the concepts that are being put in by our hearing? and how is
it, that when many of them, of varied kinds, are pressing one upon
another, there arises no confusion and error in the relative position of
the things <span id="page_396">p. 396</span> <span
id="x.ii.ii.xi-Page_396"></span>that are laid up there? And one may have
the like feeling of wonder also with regard to the operation of sight;
for by it also in like manner the mind apprehends those things which are
external to the body, and draws to itself the images of phenomena,
marking in itself the impressions of the things which are seen.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xi-p8"></span>4. And just as if there were some
extensive city receiving all comers by different entrances, all will not
congregate at any particular place, but some will go to the market, some
to the houses, others to the churches, or the streets, or lanes, or the
theatres, each according to his own inclination,—some such city of our
mind I seem to discern established in us, which the different entrances
through the senses keep filling, while the mind, distinguishing and
examining each of the things that enters, ranks them in their proper
departments of knowledge.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xi-p9"></span>5. And as, to follow the illustration of
the city, it may often be that those who are of the same family and
kindred do not enter by the same gate, coming in by different entrances,
as it may happen, but are none the less, when they come within the
circuit of the wall, brought together again, being on close terms with
each other (and one may find the contrary happen; for those who are
strangers and mutually unknown often take one entrance to the city, yet
their community of entrance does not bind them together; for even when
they are within they can be separated to join their own kindred);
something of the same kind I seem to discern in the spacious territory
of our mind; for often the knowledge which we gather from the different
organs of sense is one, as the same object is divided into several parts
in relation to the senses; and again, on the contrary, we may learn from
some one sense many and varied things which have no affinity one with
another.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xi-p10"></span>6. For instance—for it is better to
make our argument clear by illustration—let us suppose that we are
making some inquiry into the property of tastes—what is sweet to the
sense, and what is to be avoided by tasters. We find, then, by
experience, both the bitterness of gall and the pleasant character of
the quality of honey; but when these facts are known, the knowledge is
one which is given to us (the same thing being introduced to our
understanding in several ways) by taste, smell, hearing, and often by
touch and sight. For when one sees honey, and hears its name, and
receives it by taste, and recognizes its odour by smell, and tests it by
touch, he recognizes the same thing by means of each of his senses.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xi-p11"></span>7. On the other hand we get varied and
multiform information by some one sense, for as hearing receives all
sorts of sounds, and our visual perception exercises its operation by
beholding things of different kinds—for it lights alike on black and
white, and all things that are distinguished by contrariety of
colour,—so with taste, with smell, with perception by touch; each
implants in us by means of its own perceptive power the knowledge of
things of every kind.
