<span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>But</span> the descent into the water, and
the trine immersion of the person in it, involves another mystery. For
since the method of our salvation was made effectual not so much by His
precepts in the way of teaching <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2026](#fn_2024.md) as by the deeds of Him Who has
realized an actual fellowship with man, and has effected life as a
living fact, so that by means of the flesh which He has assumed, and at
the same time deified <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2027](#fn_2025.md) ,
everything kindred and related may be saved along with it, it was
necessary that some means should be devised by which there might be, in
the baptismal process, a kind of affinity and likeness between him who
follows and Him Who leads the way. Needful, therefore, is it to see what
features are to be observed in the Author of our life, in order that the
imitation on the part of those that follow may be regulated, as the
Apostle says, after the pattern of the Captain of our salvation <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[2028](#fn_2026.md) . For, as it is they who are
actually drilled into measured and orderly movements in arms by skilled
drill-masters, who are advanced to dexterity in handling their weapons
by what they see with their eyes, whereas he who does not practise what
is shown him remains devoid of such dexterity, in the same way it is
imperative on all those who have an equally earnest desire for the Good
as He has, to be followers by the path of an exact imitation of Him Who
leads the way to salvation, and to carry into action what He has shown
them. It is, in fact, impossible for persons to reach the same goal
unless they travel by the same ways. For as persons who are at a loss
how to thread the turns of mazes, when they happen to fall in with some
one who has experience of them, get to the end of those various
misleading turnings in the chambers by following him behind, which they
could not do, did they not follow him their leader step by step, so too,
I pray you mark, the labyrinth of this our life cannot be threaded by
the faculties of human nature unless a man pursues that same path as He
did Who, though <span id="page_503">p. 503</span> <span
id="xi.ii.xxxvii-Page_503"></span>once in it, yet got beyond the
difficulties which hemmed Him in. I apply this figure of a labyrinth to
that prison of death, which is without an egress <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2029](#fn_2027.md) and environs the wretched race of
mankind. What, then, have we beheld in the case of the Captain of our
salvation? A three days’ state of death and then life again. Now some
sort of resemblance in us to such things has to be planned. What, then,
is the plan by which in us too a resemblance to that which took place in
Him is completed? Everything that is affected by death has its proper
and natural place, and that is the earth in which it is laid and hidden.
Now earth and water have much mutual affinity. Alone of the elements
they have weight and gravitate downwards; they mutually abide in each
other; they are mutually confined. Seeing, then, the death of the Author
of our life subjected Him to burial in earth and was in accord with our
common nature, the imitation which we enact of that death is expressed
in the neighbouring element. And as He, that Man from above <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2030](#fn_2028.md) , having taken deadness on Himself,
after His being deposited in the earth, returned back to life the third
day, so every one who is knitted to Him by virtue of his bodily form,
looking forward to the same successful issue, I mean this arriving at
life by having, instead of earth, water poured on him <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2031](#fn_2029.md) , and so submitting to that
element, has represented for him in the three movements the
three-days-delayed grace of the resurrection. Something like this has
been said in what has gone before, namely, that by the Divine providence
death has been introduced as a dispensation into the nature of man, so
that, sin having flowed away at the dissolution of the union of soul and
body, man, through the resurrection, might be refashioned, sound,
passionless, stainless, and removed from any touch of evil. In the case
however of the Author of our Salvation this dispensation of death
reached its fulfilment, having entirely accomplished its special
purpose. For in His death, not only were things that once were one put
asunder, but also things that had been disunited were again brought
together; so that in this dissolution of things that had naturally grown
together, I mean, the soul and body, our nature might be purified, and
this return to union of these severed elements might secure freedom from
the contamination of any foreign admixture. But as regards those who
follow this Leader, their nature does not admit of an exact and entire
imitation, but it receives now as much as it is capable of receiving,
while it reserves the remainder for the time that comes after. In what,
then, does this imitation consist? It consists in the effecting the
suppression of that admixture of sin, in the figure of mortification
that is given by the water, not certainly a complete effacement, but a
kind of break in the continuity of the evil, two things concurring to
this removal of sin—the penitence of the transgressor and his imitation
of the death. By these two things the man is in a measure freed from his
congenital tendency to evil; by his penitence he advances to a hatred of
and averseness from sin, and by his death he works out the suppression
of the evil. But had it been possible for him in his imitation to
undergo a complete dying, the result would be not imitation but
identity; and the evil of our nature would so entirely vanish that, as
the Apostle says, “he would die unto sin once for all <span
id="fr_2030"></span>[2032](#fn_2030.md) .” But since, as has been said, we
only so far imitate the transcendent Power as the poverty of our nature
is capable of, by having the water thrice poured on us and ascending
again up from the water, we enact that saving burial and resurrection
which took place on the third day, with this thought in our mind, that
as we have power over the water both to be in it and arise out of it, so
He too, Who has the universe at His sovereign disposal, immersed Himself
in death, as we in the water, to return <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2033](#fn_2031.md) to His own blessedness. If,
therefore, one looks to that which is in reason, and judges of the
results according to the power inherent in either party, one will
discover no disproportion in these results, each in proportion to the
measure of his natural power working out the effects that are within his
reach. For, as it is in the power of man, if he is so disposed, to touch
the water and yet be safe, with infinitely greater ease may death be
handled by the Divine Power so as to be in it and yet not to be changed
by it injuriously. Observe, then, that it is necessary for us to
rehearse beforehand in the water the grace of the resurrection, to the
intent that we may understand that, as far as facility goes, it is the
same thing for us to be baptized with water and to rise again from
death. But as in matters that concern our life here, there are some
which take precedence of others, as being those without which the result
could not be achieved, although if the beginning be compared with the
end, the beginning so contrasted will seem of no account (for what
equality, for instance, is there between the man and that which is laid
as a foundation for the constitution of his animal being? And yet if
that had never been, neither would this be which we see), in like manner
that which happens in the great resurrection, essentially vaster <span
id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span
id="xi.ii.xxxvii-Page_504"></span>though it be, has its beginnings and
its causes here; it is not, in fact, possible that that should take
place, unless this had gone before; I mean, that without the laver of
regeneration it is impossible for the man to be in the resurrection; but
in saying this I do not regard the mere remoulding and refashioning of
our composite body; for towards this it is absolutely necessary that
human nature should advance, being constrained thereto by its own laws
according to the dispensation of Him Who has so ordained, whether it
have received the grace of the laver, or whether it remains without that
initiation: but I am thinking of the restoration to a blessed and divine
condition, separated from all shame and sorrow. For not everything that
is granted in the resurrection a return to existence will return to the
same kind of life. There is a wide interval between those who have been
purified, and those who still need purification. For those in whose
life-time here the purification by the laver has preceded, there is a
restoration to a kindred state. Now, to the pure, freedom from passion
is that kindred state, and that in this freedom from passion blessedness
consists, admits of no dispute. But as for those whose weaknesses have
become inveterate <span id="fr_2032"></span>[2034](#fn_2032.md) , and to
whom no purgation of their defilement has been applied, no mystic water,
no invocation of the Divine power, no amendment by repentance, it is
absolutely necessary that they should come to be in something proper to
their case,—just as the furnace is the proper thing for gold alloyed
with dross,—in order that, the vice which has been mixed up in them
being melted away after long succeeding ages, their nature may be
restored pure again to God. Since, then, there is a cleansing virtue in
fire and water, they who by the mystic water have washed away the
defilement of their sin have no further need of the other form of
purification, while they who have not been admitted to that form of
purgation must needs be purified by fire.

“preceding” (“præeunte,” Hervetus) teaching; but to “instruction” of any
kind, whether “in the way of teaching,” or of *example,* as below.

<span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p4"></span> *the flesh which He has assumed, and
at the same time deified.* “Un terme cher aux Pères du IVe siècle, de
nous *déifier*” (Denis, *Philosophie d’Origène,* p. 458). This <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p4.1"></span>θεοποίησις</span> or
<span class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p4.2"></span>θέωσις</span> is
more than a metaphor even from the first; “vere fideles vocantur <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p4.3"></span>θεοί</span>, non
naturâ quidem, sed <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p4.4"></span>τῇ ὁμοιώσει</span>, ait Athanasius;”
Casaubon, *In Epist. ad Eustath.* “We become ‘gods’ by grasping the
Divine power and substance;” Clement, *Stromata,* iv. That the
Platonists had thus used the word of <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p4.5"></span>τὸ πρὸς μείζονα δόξαν ἀνυψωθὲν</span> is
clear. Synesius in one of his *Hymns* says to his soul:—

<span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p5"></span>“Soon commingled with the Father

<span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p6"></span>Thou shalt dance a ‘god’ with God.”

<span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p7"></span>Just as elsewhere (*in Dione,* p. 50)
he says, “it is not sufficient not to be bad; each must be even a
‘god.’” Cf. also Gregory Thaum. *Panegyr Origenis,* §142. When we come
to the Fathers of the 4th century and later, these words are used more
especially of the *work of the Holy Spirit* upon man. Cf. Cyrill. Alex.:
“If to be able to ‘deify’ is a greater thing than a creature can do, and
if the Spirit does ‘deify,’ how can he be created or anything but God,
seeing that he ‘deifies’?” “If the Spirit is not God,” says Gregory
Naz., “let him first be deified, and then let him deify me his equal;”
where two things are implied, 1. that the recognized work of the Holy
Spirit is to ‘deify,’ 2. that this “deification” is *not* Godhead. It is
“the comparative god-making” of Dionysius Areopag. whereby we are
“partakers of the Divine nature” ([2 Pet. i.
4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md)<span
id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p7.1"></span>). On the word as applied to the human
nature of our Saviour Himself, Huet (*Origeniana,* ii. 3, c. 17), in
discussing the statement of Origen, in his Commentary on S. Matthew
(*Tract* 27), that “Christ after His resurrection ‘deified’ the human
nature which He had taken,” remarks, “If we take this word so as to make
Origen mean that the Word was changed into the human nature, and that
the flesh itself was changed into God and made of the same substance as
the Word, he will clearly be guilty of that deadly error which
Apollinaris brought into the Church (*i.e.* that the Saviour’s soul is
not ‘reasonable,’ nor His flesh human); or rather of the heresy
perpetrated by some sects of the Eutychians, who asserted that the human
nature was changed into the Divine after the Resurrection. But if we
take him to mean that Christ’s human nature, after being divested of
weakness after death, assumed a *certain* Divine quality, we shall be
doing Him no wrong.” He then quotes a line from Gregory’s *Iambics:*—

<span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p8"></span>“The thing ‘deifying,’ and the thing
‘deified,’ are one God:”

<span id="xi.ii.xxxvii-p9"></span>and this is said even of Christ’s
Incarnation; how much more then can it be said of His Resurrection
state, as in this passage of the *Great Catechism?* Huet adds one of
Origen’s answers to Celsus: “His mortal body and the human soul in Him,
by virtue of their junction or rather union and blending with that
(deity), assumed, we assert, qualities of the very greatest kind.…What
incredibility is there in the quality of mortality in the body of Jesus
changing, when God so planned and willed it, into an ethereal and
Divine” (*i.e.* the matter, as the receptacle of these qualities,
remaining the same)? It is in this sense that Chrysostom can say that
“Christ came to us, and took upon Him our nature and deified it;” and
Augustine, “your humanity received the name of that deity” *(contr.
Arian.).*
