<span id="x.ii.ii.xii-p1"></span> XI. *That the nature of mind is
invisible.* <span id="fr_1622"></span>[1624](#fn_1622)

<span id="x.ii.ii.xii-p3"></span>1. What then is, in its own nature,
this mind that distributes itself into faculties of sensation, and duly
receives, by means of each, the knowledge of things? That it is
something else besides the senses, I suppose no reasonable man doubts;
for if it were identical with sense, it would reduce the proper
character of the operations carried on by sense to one, on the ground
that it is itself simple, and that in what is simple no diversity is to
be found. Now however, as all agree that touch is one thing and smell
another, and as the rest of the senses are in like manner so situated
with regard to each other as to exclude intercommunion or mixture, we
must surely suppose, since the mind is duly present in each case, that
it is something else besides the sensitive nature, so that no variation
may attach to a thing intelligible.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xii-p4"></span>2. “Who hath known the mind of the
Lord <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1625](#fn_1623) ?” the apostle asks; and
I ask further, who has understood his own mind? Let those tell us who
consider the nature of God to be within their comprehension, whether
they understand themselves—if they know the nature of their own mind.
“It is manifold and much compounded.” How then can that which is
intelligible be composite? or what is the mode of mixture of things that
differ in kind? Or, “It is simple, and incomposite.” How then is it
dispersed into the manifold divisions of the senses? how is there
diversity in unity? how is unity maintained in diversity?

<span id="x.ii.ii.xii-p6"></span>3. But I find the solution of these
difficulties by recourse to the very utterance of God; for He says, “Let
us make man in our image, after our likeness <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1626](#fn_1624) .” The image is properly an image
so long as it fails in none of those attributes which we perceive in the
archetype; but where it falls from its resemblance to the prototype it
ceases in that respect to be an image; therefore, since one of the
attributes we contemplate in the Divine nature is incomprehensibility of
essence, it is clearly necessary that in this point the image should be
able to show its imitation of the archetype.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xii-p8"></span>4. For if, while the archetype
transcends <span id="page_397">p. 397</span> <span
id="x.ii.ii.xii-Page_397"></span>comprehension, the nature of the image
were comprehended, the contrary character of the attributes we behold in
them would prove the defect of the image; but since the nature of our
mind, which is the likeness of the Creator evades our knowledge, it has
an accurate resemblance to the superior nature, figuring by its own
unknowableness the incomprehensible Nature.
