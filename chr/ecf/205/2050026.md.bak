<span id="viii.i.iii.x"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iii.x-p1"></span> §10. *All his insulting epithets are
shewn by facts to be false.*

<span id="viii.i.iii.x-p2"></span>I therefore pass over everything else,
as mere insolent mockery and scoffing abuse, and hasten to the question
of his doctrine. Should any one say that I decline to be abusive only
because I cannot pay him back in his own coin, let such an one consider
in his own case what proneness there is to evil generally, what a
mechanical sliding into sin, dispensing with the need of any practice.
The power of becoming bad resides in the will; one act of wishing is
often the sufficient occasion for a finished wickedness; and this ease
of operation is more especially fatal in the sins of the tongue. Other
classes of sins require time and occasion and co-operation to be
committed; but the propensity to speak can sin when it likes. The
treatise of Eunomius now in our hands is sufficient to prove this; one
who attentively considers it will perceive the rapidity of the descent
into sins <span id="page_XLV">p. XLV</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.x-Page_XLV"></span>in the matter of phrases: and it is
the easiest thing in the world to imitate these, even though one is
quite unpractised in habitual defamation. What need would there be to
labour in coining our intended insults into names, when one might employ
upon this slanderer his own phrases? He has strung together, in fact, in
this part of his work, every sort of falsehood and evil-speaking, all
moulded from the models which he finds in himself; every extravagance is
to be found in writing these. He writes “cunning,” “wrangling,” “foe to
truth,” “high-flown <span id="fr_87"></span>[89](#fn_87.md) ,” “charlatan,”
“combating general opinion and tradition,” “braving facts which give him
the lie,” “careless of the terrors of the law, of the censure of men,”
“unable to distinguish the enthusiasm for truth from mere skill in
reasoning;” he adds, “wanting in reverence,” “quick to call names,” and
then “blatant,” “full of conflicting suspicions,” “combining
irreconcileable arguments,” “combating his own utterances,” “affirming
contradictories;” then, though eager to speak all ill of him, not being
able to find other novelties of invective in which to indulge his
bitterness, often in default of all else he reiterates the same phrases,
and comes round again a third and a fourth time and even more to what he
has once said; and in this circus of words he drives up and then turns
down, over and over again, the same racecourse of insolent abuse; so
that at last even anger at this shameless display dies away from very
weariness. These low unlovely street boys’ jeers do indeed provoke
disgust rather than anger; they are not a whit better than the
inarticulate grunting of some old woman who is quite drunk.

<span id="viii.i.iii.x-p4"></span>Must we then enter minutely into this,
and laboriously refute all his invectives by showing that Basil was not
this monster of his imagination? If we did this, contentedly proving the
absence of anything vile and criminal in him, we should seem to join in
insulting one who was a ‘bright particular star’ to his generation. But
I remember how with that divine voice of his he quoted the prophet <span
id="fr_88"></span>[90](#fn_88.md) with regard to him, comparing him to a
shameless woman who casts her own reproaches on the chaste. For whom do
these reasonings of his proclaim to be truth’s enemy and in arms against
public opinion? Who is it who begs the readers of his book not ‘to look
to the numbers of those who profess a belief, or to mere tradition, or
to let their judgment be biassed so as to consider as trustworthy what
is only suspected to be the stronger side?’ Can one and the same man
write like this, and then make those charges, scheming that his readers
should follow his own novelties at the very moment that he is abusing
others for opposing themselves to the general belief? As for ‘brazening
out facts which give him the lie, and men’s censure,’ I leave the reader
to judge to whom this applies; whether to one who by a most careful
self-restraint made sobriety and quietness and perfect purity the rule
of his own life as well as that of his entourage, or to one who advised
that nature should not be molested when it is her pleasure to advance
through the appetites of the body, not to thwart indulgence, nor to be
so particular as that in the training of our life; but that a
self-chosen faith should be considered sufficient for a man to attain
perfection. If he denies that this is his teaching, I and any
right-minded person would rejoice if he were telling the truth in such a
denial. But his genuine followers will not allow him to produce such a
denial, or their leading principles would be gone, and the platform of
those who for this reason embrace his tenets would fall to pieces. As
for shameless indifference to human censure, you may look at his youth
or his after life, and you would find him in both open to this reproach.
The two men’s lives, whether in youth or manhood, tell a
widely-different tale.

<span id="viii.i.iii.x-p6"></span>Let our speech-writer, while he
reminds himself of his youthful doings in his native land, and
afterwards at Constantinople, hear from those who can tell him what they
know of the man whom he slanders. But if any would inquire into their
subsequent occupations, let such a person tell us which of the two he
considers to deserve so high a reputation; the man who ungrudgingly
spent upon the poor his patrimony even before he was a priest, and most
of all in the time of the famine, during which he was a ruler of the
Church, though still a priest in the rank of presbyters <span
id="fr_89"></span>[91](#fn_89.md) ; and afterwards did not hoard even what
remained to him, so that he too might have made the Apostles’ boast,
‘Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought <span
id="fr_90"></span>[92](#fn_90.md) ;’ or, on the other hand, the man who has
made the championship of a tenet a source of income, the man who creeps
into houses, and does not conceal his loathsome affliction by staying at
home, nor considers the natural aversion which those in good health must
feel for such, though according to the law of old he is one of those who
are banished from the inhabited camp because of the contagion of his
unmistakeable <span id="fr_91"></span>[93](#fn_91.md) disease.

<span id="viii.i.iii.x-p10"></span><span id="page_XLVI">p. XLVI</span>
<span id="viii.i.iii.x-Page_XLVI"></span>Basil is called ‘hasty’ and
‘insolent,’ and in both characters ‘a liar’ by this man who ‘would in
patience and meekness educate those of a contrary opinion to himself;’
for such are the airs he gives himself when he speaks of him, while he
omits no hyperbole of bitter language, when he has a sufficient opening
to produce it. On what grounds, then, does he charge him with this
hastiness and insolence? Because ‘he called me a Galatian, though I am a
Cappadocian;’ then it was because he called a man who lived on the
boundary in an obscure corner like Corniaspine <span
id="fr_92"></span>[94](#fn_92.md) a Galatian instead of an Oltiserian;
supposing, that is, that it is proved that he said this. I have not
found it in my copies; but grant it. For this he is to be called
‘hasty,’ ‘insolent,’ all that is bad. But the wise know well that the
minute charges of a faultfinder furnish a strong argument for the
righteousness of the accused; else, when eager to accuse, he would not
have spared great faults and employed his malice on little ones. On
these last he is certainly great, heightening the enormity of the
offence, and making solemn reflections on falsehood, and seeing equal
heinousness in it whether in great or very trivial matters. Like the
fathers of his heresy, the scribes and Pharisees, he knows how to strain
a gnat carefully and to swallow at one gulp the hump-backed camel laden
with a weight of wickedness. But it would not be out of place to say to
him, ‘refrain from making such a rule in our system; cease to bid us
think it of no account to measure the guilt of a falsehood by the
slightness or the importance of the circumstances.’ Paul telling a
falsehood and purifying himself after the manner of the Jews to meet the
needs of those whom he usefully deceived did not sin the same as Judas
for the requirement of his treachery putting on a kind and affable look.
By a falsehood Joseph in love to his brethren deceived them; and that
too while swearing ‘by the life of Pharaoh <span
id="fr_93"></span>[95](#fn_93.md) ;’ but his brethren had really lied to
him, in their envy plotting his death and then his enslavement. There
are many such cases: Sarah lied, because she was ashamed of laughing:
the serpent lied, tempting man to disobey and change to a divine
existence. Falsehoods differ widely according to their motives.
Accordingly we accept that general statement about man which the Holy
Spirit uttered by the Prophet <span id="fr_94"></span>[96](#fn_94.md) ,
‘Every man is a liar;’ and this man of God, too, has not kept clear of
falsehood, having chanced to give a place the name of a neighbouring
district, through oversight or ignorance of its real name. But Eunomius
also has told a falsehood, and what is it? Nothing less than a
misstatement of Truth itself. He asserts that One who always is once was
not; he demonstrates that One who is truly a Son is falsely so called;
he defines the Creator to be a creature and a work; the Lord of the
world he calls a servant, and ranges the Being who essentially rules
with subject beings. Is the difference between falsehoods so very
trifling, that one can think it matters nothing whether the falsehood is
palpable <span id="fr_95"></span>[97](#fn_95.md) in this way or in that?

Galatia and Cappadocia is certain from what Gregory says here):
‘Probably Dacora was his paternal estate: Oltiseris the village to which
it belonged’ (Dict. Christ. Biog.; unless indeed Corniaspa, marked on
the maps as a town where Cappadocia, Galatia and Pontus join, was the
spot, and Oltiseris the district. Eunomius died at Dacora.
