<span id="ix.ii.ii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Now</span> it is impossible, as far as
manual exercise goes, to ply two arts at once; for instance, husbandry
and sailing, or tinkering and carpentering. If one is to be honestly
taken in hand, the other must be left alone. Just so, there are these
two marriages for our choice, the one effected in the flesh, the other
in the spirit; and preoccupation in the one must cause of necessity
alienation from the other. No more is the eye able to look at two
objects at once; but it must concentrate its special attention on one at
a time; no more can the tongue effect utterances in two different
languages, so as to pronounce, for instance, a Hebrew word and a Greek
word in the same moment: no more can the ear take in at one and the same
time a narrative of facts, and a hortatory discourse; if each special
tone is heard separately, it will impress its ideas upon the hearers’
minds; but if they are combined and so poured into the ear, an
inextricable confusion of ideas will be the result, one meaning being
mutually lost in the other: and no more, by analogy, do our emotional
powers possess a nature which can at once pursue the pleasures of sense
and court the spiritual union; nor, besides, can both those ends be
gained by the same courses of life; continence, mortification of the
passions, scorn of fleshly needs, are the agents of the one union; but
all that are the reverse of these are the agents of bodily habitation.
As, when two masters are before us to choose between, and we cannot be
subject to both, for “no man can serve two masters <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1485](#fn_1483.md) ,” he who is wise will choose the
one most useful to himself, so, when two marriages are before us to
choose between, and we cannot contract both, for “he that is unmarried
cares for the things of <span id="page_366">p. 366</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.xxi-Page_366"></span>the Lord, but he that is married
careth for the things of the world <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1486](#fn_1484.md) ,” I repeat that it would be the
aim of a sound mind not to miss choosing the more profitable one; and
not to be ignorant either of the way which will lead it to this, a way
which cannot be learnt but by some such comparison as the following. In
the case of a marriage of this world a man who is anxious to avoid
appearing altogether insignificant pays the greatest attention both to
physical health, and becoming adornment, and amplitude of means and the
security from any disgraceful revelations as to his antecedents or his
parentage; for so he thinks things will be most likely to turn out as he
wishes. Now just in the same way the man who is courting the spiritual
alliance will first of all display himself, by the renewal of his
mind <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1487](#fn_1485.md) , a young man, without a
single touch of age upon him; next he will reveal a lineage rich in that
in which it is a noble ambition to be rich, not priding himself on
worldly wealth, but luxuriating only in the heavenly treasures. As for
family distinction, he will not vaunt that which comes by the mere
routine of devolution even to numbers of the worthless, but that which
is gained by the successful efforts of his own zeal and labours; a
distinction which only those can boast of who are “sons of the light”
and children of God, and are styled “nobles from the sunrise <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1488](#fn_1486.md) ” because of their splendid deeds.
Strength and health he will not try to gain by bodily training and
feeding, but by all that is the contrary of this, perfecting the
spirit’s strength in the body’s weakness. I could tell also of the
suitor’s gifts to the bride in such a wedding <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1489](#fn_1487.md) ; they are not procured by the
money that perishes, but are contributed out of the wealth peculiar to
the soul. Would you know their names? You must hear from Paul, that
excellent adorner of the Bride <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1490](#fn_1488.md) , in what the wealth of those
consists who in everything commend themselves. He mentions much else
that is priceless in it, and adds, “in chastity <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1491](#fn_1489.md) ”; and besides this all the
recognized fruits of the spirit from any quarter whatever are gifts of
this marriage. If a man is going to carry out the advice of Solomon and
take for helpmate and life-companion that true Wisdom of which he says,
“Love her, and she shall keep thee,” “honour her, that she may embrace
thee <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1492](#fn_1490.md) ,” then he will prepare
himself in a manner worthy of such a love, so as to feast with all the
joyous wedding guests in spotless raiment, and not be cast forth, while
claiming to sit at that feast, for not having put on the wedding
garment. It is plain moreover that the argument applies equally to men
and women, to move them towards such a marriage. “There is neither male
nor female <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1493](#fn_1491.md) ,” the Apostle
says; “Christ is all, and in all <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1494](#fn_1492.md) ”; and so it is equally reasonable
that he who is enamoured of wisdom should hold the Object of his
passionate desire, Who is the True Wisdom; and that the soul which
cleaves to the undying Bridegroom should have the fruition of her love
for the true Wisdom, which is God. We have now sufficiently revealed the
nature of the spiritual union, and the Object of the pure and heavenly
Love.
