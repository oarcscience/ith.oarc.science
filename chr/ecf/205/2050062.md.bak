<span id="viii.i.iv.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iv.iii-p1"></span> §3. *Gregory proceeds to discuss the
relative force of the unnameable name of the Holy Trinity and the mutual
relation of the Persons, and moreover the unknowable character of the
essence, and the condescension on His part towards us, His generation of
the Virgin, and His second coming, the resurrection from the dead and
future retribution.*

<span id="viii.i.iv.iii-p2"></span>What then means that unnameable name
concerning which the Lord said, “Baptizing them into the name,” and did
not add the actual significant term which “the name” indicates? We have
concerning it this notion, that all things that exist in the creation
are defined by means of their several names. Thus whenever a man speaks
of “heaven” he directs the notion of the hearer to the created object
indicated by this name, and he who mentions “man” or some animal, at
once by the mention of the name impresses upon the hearer the form of
the creature, and in the same way all other things, by means of the
names imposed upon them, are depicted in the heart of him who by hearing
receives the appellation imposed upon the thing. The uncreated Nature
alone, which we acknowledge in the Father, and in the Son, and in the
Holy Spirit, surpasses all significance of names. For this cause the
Word, when He spoke of “the name” in delivering the Faith, did not add
what it is,—for how could a name be found for that which is above every
name?—but gave authority that whatever name our intelligence by pious
effort be enabled to discover to indicate the transcendent Nature, that
name should be applied alike to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, whether it
be “the Good” or “the Incorruptible,” whatever name each may think
proper to be employed to indicate the undefiled Nature of Godhead. And
by this deliverance the Word seems to me to lay down for us this law,
that we are to be persuaded that the Divine Essence is ineffable and
incomprehensible: for it is plain that the title of Father does not
present to us the Essence, but only indicates the relation to the Son.
It follows, then, that if it were possible for human nature to be taught
the essence of God, He “Who will have all men to be saved and to come to
the knowledge of the truth <span id="fr_258"></span>[260](#fn_258.md) ”
would not have suppressed the knowledge upon this matter. But as it is,
by saying nothing concerning the Divine Essence, He showed that the
knowledge thereof is beyond our power, while when we have learnt that of
which we are capable, we stand in no need of the knowledge beyond our
capacity, as we have in the profession of faith in the doctrine
delivered to us what suffices for our salvation. For to learn that He is
the absolutely existent, together with Whom, by the relative force of
the term, there is also declared the majesty of the Son, is the fullest
teaching of godliness; the Son, as has been said, implying in close
union with Himself the Spirit of Life and Truth, inasmuch as He is
Himself Life and Truth.

<span id="viii.i.iv.iii-p4"></span>These distinctions being thus
established, while we anathematize all heretical fancies in the sphere
of divine doctrines, we believe, even as we were taught by the voice of
the Lord, in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost, acknowledging together with this faith also the dispensation that
has been set on foot on behalf of men <span id="page_CIV">p. CIV</span>
<span id="viii.i.iv.iii-Page_CIV"></span>by the Lord of the creation.
For He “being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with
God, but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a
servant <span id="fr_259"></span>[261](#fn_259.md) ,” and being incarnate
in the Holy Virgin redeemed us from death “in which we were held,” “sold
under sin <span id="fr_260"></span>[262](#fn_260.md) ,” giving as the
ransom for the deliverance of our souls His precious blood which He
poured out by His Cross, and having through Himself made clear for us
the path of the resurrection <span id="fr_261"></span>[263](#fn_261.md)
from the dead, shall come in His own time in the glory of the Father to
judge every soul in righteousness, when “all that are in the graves
shall hear His voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good
unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the
resurrection of damnation <span id="fr_262"></span>[264](#fn_262.md) .” But
that the pernicious heresy that is now being sown broadcast by Eunomius
may not, by falling upon the mind of some of the simpler sort and being
left without investigation, do harm to guileless faith, we are
constrained to set forth the profession which they circulate and to
strive to expose the mischief of their teaching.
