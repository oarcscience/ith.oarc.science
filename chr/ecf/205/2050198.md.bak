<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii"></span>

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p1"></span> XVI. *A contemplation of the Divine
utterance which said—“Let us make man after our image and likeness”;
wherein is examined what is the definition of the image, and how the
passible and mortal is like to the Blessed and Impassible, and how in
the image there are male and female, seeing these are not in the
prototype* <span id="fr_1646"></span>[1648](#fn_1646.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p3"></span>1. Let us now resume our consideration
of the Divine word, “Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1649](#fn_1647.md) .” How mean and how
unworthy of the majesty of man are the fancies of some heathen writers,
who magnify humanity, as they supposed, by their comparison of it to
this world! for they say that man is a little world, composed of the
same elements with the universe. Those who bestow on human nature such
praise as this by a high-sounding name, forget that they are dignifying
man with the attributes of the gnat and the mouse: for they too are
composed of these four elements,—because assuredly about the animated
nature of every existing thing we behold a part, greater or less, of
those elements without which it is not natural that any sensitive being
should exist. What great thing is there, then, in man’s being accounted
a representation and likeness of the world,—of the heaven that passes
away, of the earth that changes, of all things that they contain, which
pass away with the departure of that which compasses them round?

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p5"></span>2. In what then does the greatness of
man consist, according to the doctrine of the Church? Not in his
likeness to the created world, but in his being in the image of the
nature of the Creator.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p6"></span>3. What therefore, you will perhaps
say, is the definition of the image? How is the incorporeal likened to
body? how is the temporal like the eternal? that which is mutable by
change like to the immutable? that which is subject to passion and
corruption to the impassible and incorruptible? that which constantly
dwells with evil, and grows up with it, to that which is absolutely free
from evil? there is a great difference between that which is conceived
in the archetype, and a thing which has been made in its image: for the
image is properly so called if it keeps its resemblance to the
prototype; but if the imitation be perverted from its subject, the thing
is something else, and no longer an image of the subject.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p7"></span>4. How then is man, this mortal,
passible, shortlived being, the image of that nature which is immortal,
pure, and everlasting? The true answer to this question, indeed, perhaps
only the very Truth knows: but this is what we, tracing out the truth so
far as we are capable by conjectures and inferences, apprehend
concerning the matter. Neither does the word of God lie when it says
that man was made in the image of God, nor is the pitiable suffering of
man’s nature like to the blessedness of the impassible Life: for if any
one were to compare our nature with God, one of two things must needs be
allowed in order that the definition of the likeness may be apprehended
in both cases in the same terms,—either that the Deity is passible, or
that humanity is impassible: but if neither the Deity is passible nor
our nature free from passion, what other account remains whereby we may
say that the word of God speaks truly, which says that man was made in
the image of God?

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p8"></span>5. We must, then, take up once more
the Holy Scripture itself, if we may perhaps find some guidance in the
question by means of what is written. After saying, “Let us make man in
our image,” and for what purposes it was said “Let us make him,” it adds
this saying:—“and God created man; in the image of God created He him;
male and female created He them <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1650](#fn_1648.md) .” We have already said in what
precedes, that this saying was uttered for the destruction of heretical
impiety, in order that being instructed that the Only-begotten God made
man in the image of God, we should in no wise distinguish the Godhead of
the Father and the Son, since Holy Scripture gives to each equally the
name of God,—to Him Who made man, and to Him in Whose image he was made.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p10"></span><span id="page_405">p. 405</span>
<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-Page_405"></span>6. However, let us pass by our
argument upon this point: let us turn our inquiry to the question before
us,—how it is that while the Deity is in bliss, and humanity is in
misery, the latter is yet in Scripture called “like” the former?

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p11"></span>7. We must, then, examine the words
carefully: for we find, if we do so, that that which was made “in the
image” is one thing, and that which is now manifested in wretchedness is
another. “God created man,” it says; “in the image of God created He
him <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1651](#fn_1649.md) .” There is an end of the
creation of that which was made “in the image”: then it makes a
resumption of the account of creation, and says, “male and female
created He them.” I presume that every one knows that this is a
departure from the Prototype: for “in Christ Jesus,” as the apostle
says, “there is neither male nor female <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1652](#fn_1650.md) .” Yet the phrase declares that man
is thus divided.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p14"></span>8. Thus the creation of our nature is
in a sense twofold: one made like to God, one divided according to this
distinction: for something like this the passage darkly conveys by its
arrangement, where it first says, “God created man, in the image of God
created He him <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1653](#fn_1651.md) ,” and then,
adding to what has been said, “male and female created He them <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1654](#fn_1652.md) ,”—a thing which is alien from our
conceptions of God.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p17"></span>9. I think that by these words Holy
Scripture conveys to us a great and lofty doctrine; and the doctrine is
this. While two natures—the Divine and incorporeal nature, and the
irrational life of brutes—are separated from each other as extremes,
human nature is the mean between them: for in the compound nature of man
we may behold a part of each of the natures I have mentioned,—of the
Divine, the rational and intelligent element, which does not admit the
distinction of male and female; of the irrational, our bodily form and
structure, divided into male and female: for each of these elements is
certainly to be found in all that partakes of human life. That the
intellectual element, however, precedes the other, we learn as from one
who gives in order an account of the making of man; and we learn also
that his community and kindred with the irrational is for man a
provision for reproduction. For he says first that “God created man in
the image of God” (showing by these words, as the Apostle says, that in
such a being there is no male or female): then he adds the peculiar
attributes of human nature, “male and female created He them <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1655](#fn_1653.md) .”

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p19"></span>10. What, then, do we learn from
this? Let no one, I pray, be indignant if I bring from far an argument
to bear upon the present subject. God is in His own nature all that
which our mind can conceive of good;—rather, transcending all good that
we can conceive or comprehend. He creates man for no other reason than
that He is good; and being such, and having this as His reason for
entering upon the creation of our nature, He would not exhibit the power
of His goodness in an imperfect form, giving our nature some one of the
things at His disposal, and grudging it a share in another: but the
perfect form of goodness is here to be seen by His both bringing man
into being from nothing, and fully supplying him with all good gifts:
but since the list of individual good gifts is a long one, it is out of
the question to apprehend it numerically. The language of Scripture
therefore expresses it concisely by a comprehensive phrase, in saying
that man was made “in the image of God”: for this is the same as to say
that He made human nature participant in all good; for if the Deity is
the fulness of good, and this is His image, then the image finds its
resemblance to the Archetype in being filled with all good.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p20"></span>11. Thus there is in us the principle
of all excellence, all virtue and wisdom, and every higher thing that we
conceive: but pre-eminent among all is the fact that we are free from
necessity, and not in bondage to any natural power, but have decision in
our own power as we please; for virtue is a voluntary thing, subject to
no dominion: that which is the result of compulsion and force cannot be
virtue.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p21"></span>12. Now as the image bears in all
points the semblance of the archetypal excellence, if it had not a
difference in some respect, being absolutely without divergence it would
no longer be a likeness, but will in that case manifestly be absolutely
identical with the Prototype. What difference then do we discern between
the Divine and that which has been made like to the Divine? We find it
in the fact that the former is uncreate, while the latter has its being
from creation: and this distinction of property brings with it a train
of other properties; for it is very certainly acknowledged that the
uncreated nature is also immutable, and always remains the same, while
the created nature cannot exist without change; for its very passage
from nonexistence to existence is a certain motion and change of the
non-existent transmuted by the Divine purpose into being.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p22"></span>13. As the Gospel calls the stamp
upon the coin “the image of Cæsar <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1656](#fn_1654.md) ,” whereby we learn that in that
which was fashioned to resemble Cæsar there was resemblance as to
outward look, but difference as to material, so also in the present
saying, when we consider the attri<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>
<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-Page_406"></span>butes contemplated both in the
Divine and human nature, in which the likeness consists, to be in the
place of the features, we find in what underlies them the difference
which we behold in the uncreated and in the created nature.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p24"></span>14. Now as the former always remains
the same, while that which came into being by creation had the beginning
of its existence from change, and has a kindred connection with the like
mutation, for this reason He Who, as the prophetical writing says,
“knoweth all things before they be <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1657](#fn_1655.md) ,” following out, or rather
perceiving beforehand by His power of foreknowledge what, in a state of
independence and freedom, is the tendency of the motion of man’s
will,—as He saw, I say, what would be, He devised for His image the
distinction of male and female, which has no reference to the Divine
Archetype, but, as we have said, is an approximation to the less
rational nature.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p26"></span>15. The cause, indeed, of this
device, only those can know who were eye-witnesses of the truth and
ministers of the Word; but we, imagining the truth, as far as we can, by
means of conjectures and similitudes, do not set forth that which occurs
to our mind authoritatively, but will place it in the form of a
theoretical speculation before our kindly hearers.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p27"></span>16. What is it then which we
understand concerning these matters? In saying that “God created man”
the text indicates, by the indefinite character of the term, all
mankind; for was not Adam here named together with the creation, as the
history tells us in what follows <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1658](#fn_1656.md) ? yet the name given to the man
created is not the particular, but the general name: thus we are led by
the employment of the general name of our nature to some such view as
this—that in the Divine foreknowledge and power all humanity is included
in the first creation; for it is fitting for God not to regard any of
the things made by Him as indeterminate, but that each existing thing
should have some limit and measure prescribed by the wisdom of its
Maker.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p29"></span>17. Now just as any particular man is
limited by his bodily dimensions, and the peculiar size which is
conjoined with the superficies of his body is the measure of his
separate existence, so I think that the entire plenitude of humanity was
included by the God of all, by His power of foreknowledge, as it were in
one body, and that this is what the text teaches us which says, “God
created man, in the image of God created He him.” For the image is not
in part of our nature, nor is the grace in any one of the things found
in that nature, but this power extends equally to all the race: and a
sign of this is that mind is implanted alike in all: for all have the
power of understanding and deliberating, and of all else whereby the
Divine nature finds its image in that which was made according to it:
the man that was manifested at the first creation of the world, and he
that shall be after the consummation of all, are alike: they equally
bear in themselves the Divine image <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1659](#fn_1657.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p31"></span>18. For this reason the whole race
was spoken of as one man, namely, that to God’s power nothing is either
past or future, but even that which we expect is comprehended, equally
with what is at present existing, by the all-sustaining energy. Our
whole nature, then, extending from the first to the last, is, so to say,
one image of Him Who is; but the distinction of kind in male and female
was added to His work last, as I suppose, for the reason which
follows <span id="fr_1658"></span>[1660](#fn_1658.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p28"></span> The punctuation followed by Forbes
here does not seem to give a good sense, and also places S. Gregory in
the position of formally stating that one passage of Genesis contradicts
another. By substituting an interrogation after <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p28.1"></span>ἡ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p28.2"></span>ἱστορία φησίν</span>,
the sense given is this:—we know from a later statement in Genesis that
the name Adam was given “in the day that they were created” (<span
id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p28.3"></span>[Gen. v.
2](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#002.md)<span
id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p28.4"></span>), but here the name given is *general,*
not *particular.* There must be a reason for this, and the reason is,
that the race of man, and not the individual, is that spoken of as
“created in the image of God.” With this view that all humanity is
included in the first creation may be compared a passage near the end of
the *De Animâ,* where the first man is compared to a full ear of corn,
afterwards “divided into a multitude of bare grain.”

<span id="fn_1657"></span>[406:1659](2050198.htm#fr_1657.md) <span
id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p30"></span> With this passage, again, may be
compared the teaching of the *De Animâ* on the subject of the
Resurrection.

id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii.ii.xvii-p32"></span> The explanation of the reason,
however, is deferred; see xvii. 4.
