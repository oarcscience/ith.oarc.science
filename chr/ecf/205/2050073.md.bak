<span id="viii.i.iv.xiv"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iv.xiv-p1"></span> §14. *He proceeds to discuss the
views held by Eunomius, and by the Church, touching the Holy Spirit; and
to show that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are not three Gods,
but one God. He also discusses different senses of “Subjection,” and
therein shows that the subjection of all things to the Son is the same
as the subjection of the Son to the Father.*

<span id="viii.i.iv.xiv-p2"></span>Thus much with regard to his
profanity towards the Son. Now let us see what he says about the Holy
Spirit. “After Him, we believe,” he says, “on the Comforter, the Spirit
of Truth.” I think it will be plain to all who come across this passage
what object he has in view in thus perverting the declaration of the
faith delivered to us by the Lord, in his statements concerning the Son
and the Father. Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will
nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his
knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name “Father,” that
so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he
avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His
natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying
“Holy Spirit,” that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of
His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since
the appellation of “Spirit,” and that of “Holy,” are by the Scriptures
equally applied to the Father and the Son (for “God is a Spirit <span
id="fr_449"></span>[451](#fn_449.md) ,” and “the anointed Lord is the
Spirit before our face <span id="fr_450"></span>[452](#fn_450.md) ,” and
“the Lord our God is Holy <span id="fr_451"></span>[453](#fn_451.md) ,” and
there is “one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ <span
id="fr_452"></span>[454](#fn_452) ”.md) lest there should, by the use of
these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox
conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them
from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son,
for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words
of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making
a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety
against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, “We believe in the Holy
Spirit,” and “God is a Spirit,” any one instructed in things divine
would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy
Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in
nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For
of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor
metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are
necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is
signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this
reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the
formula of the faith, he says, “We believe in the Comforter.” But I have
been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired
Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the
name of “Comforter” equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit <span
id="fr_453"></span>[455](#fn_453.md) ; and the Father, where He is said to
work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of “Comforter.” For
assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name
belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, “Thou, Lord, hast
holpen me and comforted me <span id="fr_454"></span>[456](#fn_454.md) ,”
and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he
says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who
comforteth us in all our tribulation <span
id="fr_455"></span>[457](#fn_455.md) ”; and John, in one of his Catholic
Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter <span
id="fr_456"></span>[458](#fn_456.md) . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in
saying that *another* Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the
Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But
as there are two senses of the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.iv.xiv-p10.3"></span>παρακαλεῖν</span> <span
id="fr_457"></span>[459](#fn_457.md) ,—one to *beseech*, by words and
gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to
feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,—the other to
*comfort*, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,—the
Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense
alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before
us by the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.iv.xiv-p11.1"></span>παρακαλεῖν</span> the healing power of
God, as when he says, “God, Who comforteth those that are cast down,
comforted us by the coming of Titus <span
id="fr_458"></span>[460](#fn_458.md) ”; and at another time he uses this
word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians,
“Now we are am<span id="page_CXXIX">p. CXXIX</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.xiv-Page_CXXIX"></span>bassadors for Christ, as though God
did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled
to God <span id="fr_459"></span>[461](#fn_459.md) .” Now since these things
are so, in whatever way you understand the title “Paraclete,” when used
of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him
from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he
has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of
the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture
refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him “the Spirit
of Truth,” Eunomius’ own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase
subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of
Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the
Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of
righteousness <span id="fr_460"></span>[462](#fn_460.md) ; and we certainly
do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness.
Wherefore also, when we hear of the “Spirit of Truth,” we acquire by
that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the
loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord
said “The Spirit of Truth,” He immediately added “Which proceedeth from
the Father <span id="fr_461"></span>[463](#fn_461.md) ,” a fact which the
voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation,
not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities,
powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this
world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from
share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and
peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in “the Guide
of godliness.” Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus,
and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into
the way of the faith. For if we are to believe in “that which guides us
to godliness,” along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and
lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors, and
teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they have been
“guides to godliness” to those who came after them. “Who came into
being,” he goes on, “by the only God through the Only-begotten.” In
these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he
calls the Father “only God,” who employs the Only-begotten as an
instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow of such a
notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion?
by deduction from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a
conclusion as this? Which of the Evangelists says it? what apostle? what
prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely inspired, written
by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For
example (for it is better to prove my position from the actual
testimonies), those who receive power to become children of God bear
witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that utterance of
the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the
children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the
children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the
flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as
many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God <span
id="fr_462"></span>[464](#fn_462.md) . So also when the Lord by breathing
upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, “Of
His fulness have all we received <span id="fr_463"></span>[465](#fn_463.md)
.” And that “in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead <span
id="fr_464"></span>[466](#fn_464.md) ,” the mighty Paul attests: yea,
moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the
manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw
Him that sat “on the throne high and lifted up <span
id="fr_465"></span>[467](#fn_465.md) ;” the older tradition, it is true,
says that it was the Father Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John
refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying, touching those of the Jews who
did not believe the words uttered by the prophet concerning the Lord,
“These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him <span
id="fr_466"></span>[468](#fn_466.md) .” But the mighty Paul attributes the
same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews at Rome,
when he says, “Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet
concerning you, saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not
understand <span id="fr_467"></span>[469](#fn_467.md) ,” showing, in my
opinion, by Holy Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision,
every theophany, every word uttered in the Person of God, is to be
understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence
when David says, “they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him
in the desert <span id="fr_468"></span>[470](#fn_468.md) ,” the apostle
refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in
these terms: “Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your
hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the
wilderness; when your fathers tempted me <span
id="fr_469"></span>[471](#fn_469.md) ,” and goes on to refer all that the
prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those who keep
repeating against us the phrase “three Gods,” because we hold these
views, have per<span id="page_CXXX">p. CXXX</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.xiv-Page_CXXX"></span>haps not yet learnt how to count.
For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality, (for they
are, according to the Lord’s words, One, and not Two <span
id="fr_470"></span>[472](#fn_470) .md) and if the Holy Ghost is also one,
how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is it
not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number
of three Gods, without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a
pair of Gods? For it is by being added to two that the one completes the
triad of Gods. But what room is there for the charge of tritheism
against those by whom one God is worshipped, the God expressed by the
Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost?

<span id="viii.i.iv.xiv-p25"></span>Let us however resume Eunomius’
statement in its entirety. “Having come into being from the only God
through the Only-begotten, this Spirit also—” What proof is there of the
statement that “this Spirit also” is one of the things that were made by
the Only-begotten? They will say of course that “all things were made by
Him <span id="fr_471"></span>[473](#fn_471.md) ,” and that in the term “all
things” “this Spirit also” is included. Our answer to them shall be
this, All things were made by Him, that were made. Now the things that
were made, as Paul tells us, were things visible and invisible, thrones,
authorities, dominions, principalities, powers, and among those included
under the head of thrones and powers are reckoned by Paul the Cherubim
and Seraphim <span id="fr_472"></span>[474](#fn_472.md) : so far does the
term “all things” extend. But of the Holy Spirit, as being above the
nature of things that have come into being, Paul said not a word in his
enumeration of existing things, not indicating to us by his words either
His subordination or His coming into being; but just as the prophet
calls the Holy Spirit “good,” and “right,” and “guiding <span
id="fr_473"></span>[475](#fn_473.md) ” (indicating by the word “guiding”
the power of control), even so the apostle ascribes independent
authority to the dignity of the Spirit, when he affirms that He works
all in all as He wills <span id="fr_474"></span>[476](#fn_474.md) . Again,
the Lord makes manifest the Spirit’s independent power and operation in
His discourse with Nicodemus, when He says, “The Spirit breatheth where
He willeth <span id="fr_475"></span>[477](#fn_475.md) .” How is it then
that Eunomius goes so far as to define that He also is one of the things
that came into being by the Son, condemned to eternal subjection. For he
describes Him as “once for all made subject,” enthralling the guiding
and governing Spirit in I know not what form of subjection. For this
expression of “subjection” has many significations in Holy Scripture,
and is understood and used with many varieties of meaning. For the
Psalmist says that even irrational nature is put in subjection <span
id="fr_476"></span>[478](#fn_476.md) , and brings under the same term those
who are overcome in war <span id="fr_477"></span>[479](#fn_477.md) , while
the apostle bids servants to be in subjection to their own masters <span
id="fr_478"></span>[480](#fn_478.md) , and that those who are placed over
the priesthood should have their children in subjection <span
id="fr_479"></span>[481](#fn_479.md) , as their disorderly conduct brings
discredit upon their fathers, as in the case of the sons of Eli the
priest. Again, he speaks of the subjection of all men to God, when we
all, being united to one another by the faith, become one body of the
Lord Who is in all, as the subjection of the Son to the Father, when the
adoration paid to the Son by all things with one accord, by things in
heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, redounds to the
glory of the Father; as Paul says elsewhere, “To Him every knee shall
bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the
earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
glory of God the Father <span id="fr_480"></span>[482](#fn_480.md) .” For
when this takes place, the mighty wisdom of Paul affirms that the Son,
Who is in all, is subject to the Father by virtue of the subjection of
those in whom He is. What kind of “subjection once for all” Eunomius
asserts of the Holy Spirit, it is thus impossible to learn from the
phrase which he has thrown out,—whether he means the subjection of
irrational creatures, or of captives, or of servants, or of children who
are kept in order, or of those who are saved by subjection. For the
subjection of men to God is salvation for those who are so made subject,
according to the voice of the prophet, who says that his soul is subject
to God, since of Him cometh salvation by subjection <span
id="fr_481"></span>[483](#fn_481.md) , so that subjection is the means of
averting perdition. As therefore the help of the healing art is sought
eagerly by the sick, so is subjection by those who are in need of
salvation. But of what life does the Holy Spirit, that quickeneth all
things, stand in need, that by subjection He should obtain salvation for
Himself? Since then it is not on the strength of any Divine utterance
that he asserts such an attribute of the Spirit, nor yet is it as a
consequence of probable arguments that he has launched this blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit, it must be plain at all events to sensible men
that he vents his impiety against Him without any warrant whatsoever,
unsupported as it is by any authority from Scripture or by any logical
consequence.
