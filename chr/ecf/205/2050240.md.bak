id="xi.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is, then, universally acknowledged
that we must believe the Deity to be not only almighty, but just, and
good, and wise, and everything else that suggests excellence. It
follows, therefore, in the present dispensation of things, that it is
not the case that some particular one <span
id="fr_1991"></span>[1993](#fn_1991.md) of these Divine attributes freely
displays itself in creation, while there is another that is not present
there; for, speaking once for all, no one of those exalted terms, when
disjoined from the rest, is by itself alone a virtue, nor is the good
really good unless allied with what is just, and wise, and mighty (for
what is unjust, or unwise, or powerless, is not good, neither is power,
when disjoined from the principle of justice and of wisdom, to be
considered in the light of virtue; such species of power is brutal and
tyrannous; and so, as to the rest, if what is wise be carried beyond the
limits of what is just, or if what is just be not contemplated along
with might and goodness, cases of that sort one would more properly call
vice; for how can what comes short of perfection be reckoned among
things that are good?). If, then, it is fitting that all excellences
should be combined in the views we have of God, let us see whether this
Dispensation as regards man fails in any of those conceptions which we
should entertain of Him. The object of our inquiry in the case of God is
before all things the indications of His goodness. And what testimony to
His goodness could there be more palpable than this, viz. His regaining
to Himself the allegiance of one who had revolted to the opposite side,
instead of allowing the fixed goodness of His nature to be affected by
the variableness of the human will? For, as David says, He had not come
to save us had not “goodness” created in Him such a purpose <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1994](#fn_1992.md) ; and yet His goodness had not
advanced His purpose had not wisdom given efficacy to His love for man.
For, as in the case of persons who are in a sickly condition, there are
probably many who wish that a man were not in such evil plight, but it
is only they in whom there is some technical ability operating in behalf
of the sick, who bring their good-will on their behalf to a practical
issue, so it is absolutely needful that wisdom should be conjoined with
goodness. In what way, then, is wisdom contemplated in combination with
goodness; in the actual events, that is, which have taken place? because
one cannot observe a good purpose in the abstract; a purpose cannot
possibly be revealed unless it has the light of some events upon it.
Well, the things accomplished, progressing as they did in orderly series
and sequence, reveal the wisdom and the skill of the Divine economy. And
since, as has been before remarked, wisdom, when combined with justice,
then absolutely becomes a virtue, but, if it be disjoined from it,
cannot in itself alone be good, it were well moreover in this discussion
of the Dispensation in regard to man, to consider attentively in the
light of each other these two qualities; I mean, its wisdom and its
justice.

the same variety of reading in c. i. and xxi., where Krabinger has
preserved the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxii-p3.3"></span>τι</span>: he well quotes Synesius, *de
