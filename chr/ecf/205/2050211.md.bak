<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p1"></span> XXIX. *An establishment of the
doctrine that the cause of the existence of soul and body is one and the
same.* <span id="fr_1733"></span>[1735](#fn_1733.md)

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p3"></span>1. Nor again are we in our doctrine to
begin by making up man like a clay figure, and to say that the soul came
into being for the sake of this; for surely in that case the
intellectual nature would be shown to be less precious than the clay
figure. But as man is one, the being consisting of soul and body, we are
to suppose that the beginning of his existence is one, common to both
parts, so that he should not be found to be antecedent and posterior to
himself, if the bodily element were first in point of time, and the
other were a later addition; but we are to say that in the power of
God’s foreknowledge (according to the doctrine laid down a little
earlier in our discourse), all the fulness of human nature had
pre-existence (and to this the prophetic writing bears witness, which
says that God “knoweth all things before they be <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1736](#fn_1734) ”.md), and in the creation of
individuals not to place the one element before the other, neither the
soul before the <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="x.ii.ii.xxx-Page_421"></span>body, nor the contrary, that man may
not be at strife against himself, by being divided by the difference in
point of time.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p5"></span>2. For as our nature is conceived as
twofold, according to the apostolic teaching, made up of the visible man
and the hidden man, if the one came first and the other supervened, the
power of Him that made us will be shown to be in some way imperfect, as
not being completely sufficient for the whole task at once, but dividing
the work, and busying itself with each of the halves in turn.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p6"></span>3. But just as we say that in wheat, or
in any other grain, the whole form of the plant is potentially
included—the leaves, the stalk, the joints, the grain, the beard—and do
not say in our account of its nature that any of these things has
pre-existence, or comes into being before the others, but that the power
abiding in the seed is manifested in a certain natural order, not by any
means that another nature is infused into it—in the same way we suppose
the human germ to possess the potentiality of its nature, sown with it
at the first start of its existence, and that it is unfolded and
manifested by a natural sequence as it proceeds to its perfect state,
not employing anything external to itself as a stepping-stone to
perfection, but itself advancing its own self in due course to the
perfect state; so that it is not true to say either that the soul exists
before the body, or that the body exists without the soul, but that
there is one beginning of both, which according to the heavenly view was
laid as their foundation in the original will of God; according to the
other, came into existence on the occasion of generation.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p7"></span>4. For as we cannot discern the
articulation of the limbs in that which is implanted for the conception
of the body before it begins to take form, so neither is it possible to
perceive in the same the properties of the soul before they advance to
operation; and just as no one would doubt that the thing so implanted is
fashioned into the different varieties of limbs and interior organs, not
by the importation of any other power from without, but by the power
which resides in it transforming <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1737](#fn_1735.md) it to this manifestation of
energy,—so also we may by like reasoning equally suppose in the case of
the soul that even if it is not visibly recognized by any manifestations
of activity it none the less is there; for even the form of the future
man is there potentially, but is concealed because it is not possible
that it should be made visible before the necessary sequence of events
allows it; so also the soul is there, even though it is not visible, and
will be manifested by means of its own proper and natural operation, as
it advances concurrently with the bodily growth.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p9"></span>5. For since it is not from a dead body
that the potentiality for conception is secreted, but from one which is
animate and alive, we hence affirm that it is reasonable that we should
not suppose that what is sent forth from a living body to be the
occasion of life is itself dead and inanimate; for in the flesh that
which is inanimate is surely dead; and the condition of death arises by
the withdrawal of the soul. Would not one therefore in this case be
asserting that withdrawal is antecedent to possession—if, that is, he
should maintain that the inanimate state which is the condition of death
is antecedent to the soul <span id="fr_1736"></span>[1738](#fn_1736.md) ?
And if any one should seek for a still clearer evidence of the life of
that particle which becomes the beginning of the living creature in its
formation, it is possible to obtain an idea on this point from other
signs also, by which what is animate is distinguished from what is dead.
For in the case of men we consider it an evidence of life that one is
warm and operative and in motion, but the chill and motionless state in
the case of bodies is nothing else than deadness.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p11"></span>6. Since then we see that of which we
are speaking to be warm and operative, we thereby draw the further
inference that it is not inanimate; but as, in respect of its corporeal
part, we do not say that it is flesh, and bones, and hair, and all that
we observe in the human being, but that potentially it is each of these
things, yet does not visibly appear to be so; so also of the part which
belongs to the soul, the elements of rationality, and desire, and anger,
and all the powers of the soul are not yet visible; yet we assert that
they have their place in it, and that the energies of the soul also grow
with the subject in a manner similar to the formation and perfection of
the body.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p12"></span>7. For just as a man when perfectly
developed has a specially marked activity of the soul, so at the
beginning of his existence he shows in himself that co-operation of the
soul which is suitable and conformable to his existing need, in its
preparing for itself its proper dwelling-place by means of the implanted
matter; for we do not suppose it possible that the soul is adapted to a
strange building, just as it is not possible that the seal impressed on
wax should be fitted to an engraving that does not agree with it.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p13"></span>8. For as the body proceeds from a
very small original to the perfect state, so also the operation of the
soul, growing in correspondence with the subject, gains and increases
with it. <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="x.ii.ii.xxx-Page_422"></span>For at its first formation there comes
first of all its power of growth and nutriment alone, as though it were
some root buried in the ground; for the limited nature of the recipient
does not admit of more; then, as the plant comes forth to the light and
shows its shoot to the sun, the gift of sensibility blossoms in
addition, but when at last it is ripened and has grown up to its proper
height, the power of reason begins to shine forth like a fruit, not
appearing in its whole vigour all at once, but by care increasing with
the perfection of the instrument, bearing always as much fruit as the
powers of the subject allow.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p14"></span>9. If, however, thou seekest to trace
the operation of the soul in the formation of the body, “take heed to
thyself <span id="fr_1737"></span>[1739](#fn_1737.md) ,” as Moses says, and
thou wilt read, as in a book, the history of the works of the soul; for
nature itself expounds to thee, more clearly than any discourse, the
varied occupations of the soul in the body, alike in general and in
particular acts of construction.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p16"></span>10. But I deem it superfluous to
declare at length in words what is to be found in ourselves, as though
we were expounding some wonder that lay beyond our boundaries:—who that
looks on himself needs words to teach him his own nature? For it is
possible for one who considers the mode of his own life, and learns how
closely concerned the body is in every vital operation, to know in what
the vegetative <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1740](#fn_1738.md) principle of
the soul was occupied on the occasion of the first formation of that
which was beginning its existence; so that hereby also it is clear to
those who have given any attention to the matter, that the thing which
was implanted by separation from the living body for the production of
the living being was not a thing dead or inanimate in the laboratory of
nature.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxx-p18"></span>11. Moreover we plant in the ground
the kernels of fruits, and portions torn from roots, not deprived by
death of the vital power which naturally resides in them, but preserving
in themselves, hidden indeed, yet surely living, the property of their
prototype; the earth that surrounds them does not implant such a power
from without, infusing it from itself (for surely then even dead wood
would proceed to growth), but it makes that manifest which resides in
them, nourishing it by its own moisture, perfecting the plant into root,
and bark, and pith, and shoots of branches, which could not happen were
not a natural power implanted with it, which drawing to itself from its
surroundings its kindred and proper nourishment, becomes a bush, or a
tree, or an ear of grain, or some plant of the class of shrubs.
