<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p1"></span> XXVIII. *To those who say that souls
existed before bodies, or that bodies were formed before souls; wherein
there is also a refutation of the fables concerning transmigration of
souls* <span id="fr_1728"></span>[1730](#fn_1728.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p3"></span>1. For it is perhaps not beyond our
present subject to discuss the question which has been raised in the
churches touching soul and body. Some of those before our time who have
dealt with the question of “principles” think it right to say that souls
have a previous existence as a people in a society of their own, and
that among them also there are standards of vice and of virtue, and that
the soul there, which abides in goodness, remains without experience of
conjunction with the body; but if it does depart from its communion with
good, it falls down to this lower life, and so comes to be in a body.
Others, on the contrary, marking the order of the making of man as
stated by Moses, say, that the soul is second to the body in order of
time, since God first took dust from the earth and formed man, and then
animated the being thus formed by His breath <span
id="fr_1729"></span>[1731](#fn_1729.md) : and by this argument they prove
that the flesh is more noble than the soul; that which was previously
formed than that which was afterwards infused into it: for they say that
the soul was made for the body, that the thing formed might not be
without breath and motion; and that everything that is made for
something else is surely less precious than that for which it is made,
as the Gospel tells us that “the soul is more than meat and the body
than raiment <span id="fr_1730"></span>[1732](#fn_1730.md) ,” because the
latter things exist for the sake of the former—for the soul was not made
for meat nor our bodies for raiment, but when the former things were
already in being the latter were provided for their needs.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p6"></span>2. Since then the doctrine involved in
both these theories is open to criticism—the doctrine alike of those who
ascribe to souls a fabulous pre-existence in a special state, and of
those who think they were created at a later time than the bodies, it is
perhaps necessary to leave none of the statements contained in the
doctrines without examination: yet to engage and wrestle with the
doctrines on each side completely, and to reveal all the absurdities
involved in the theories, would need a large expenditure both of
argument and of time; we shall, however, briefly survey as best we can
each of the views mentioned, and then resume our subject.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p7"></span>3. Those who stand by the former
doctrine, and assert that the state of souls is prior to their life in
the flesh, do not seem to me to be clear from the fabulous doctrines of
the heathen which they hold on the subject of successive incorporation:
for if one should search carefully, he will find that their doctrine is
of necessity brought down to this. They tell us that one of their sages
said that he, being one and the same person, was born a man, and
afterwards assumed the form of a woman, and flew about with the birds,
and grew as a bush, and obtained the life of an aquatic creature;—and he
who said these things of himself did not, so far as I can judge, go far
from the truth: for such doctrines as this of saying that one soul
passed through so many changes are really fitting for the chatter of
frogs or jackdaws, or the stupidity of fishes, or the insensibility of
trees.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p8"></span><span id="page_420">p. 420</span>
<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-Page_420"></span>4. And of such absurdity the
cause is this—the supposition of the pre-existence of souls for the
first principle of such doctrine leads on the argument by consequence to
the next and adjacent stage, until it astonishes us by reaching this
point. For if the soul, being severed from the more exalted state by
some wickedness after having once, as they say, tasted corporeal life,
again becomes a man, and if the life in the flesh is, as may be
presumed, acknowledged to be, in comparison with the eternal and
incorporeal life, more subject to passion, it naturally follows that
that which comes to be in a life such as to contain more occasions of
sin, is both placed in a region of greater wickedness and rendered more
subject to passion than before (now passion in the human soul is a
conformity to the likeness of the irrational); and that being brought
into close connection with this, it descends to the brute nature: and
that when it has once set out on its way through wickedness, it does not
cease its advance towards evil even when found in an irrational
condition: for a halt in evil is the beginning of the impulse towards
virtue, and in irrational creatures virtue does not exist. Thus it will
of necessity be continually changed for the worse, always proceeding to
what is more degraded and always finding out what is worse than the
nature in which it is: and just as the sensible nature is lower than the
rational, so too there is a descent from this to the insensible.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p9"></span>5. Now so far in its course their
doctrine, even if it does overstep the bounds of truth, at all events
derives one absurdity from another by a kind of logical sequence: but
from this point onwards their teaching takes the form of incoherent
fable. Strict inference points to the complete destruction of the soul;
for that which has once fallen from the exalted state will be unable to
halt at any measure of wickedness, but will pass by means of its
relation with the passions from rational to irrational, and from the
latter state will be transferred to the insensibility of plants; and on
the insensible there borders, so to say, the inanimate; and on this
again follows the non-existent, so that absolutely by this train of
reasoning they will have the soul to pass into nothing: thus a return
once more to the better state is impossible for it: and yet they make
the soul return from a bush to the man: they therefore prove that the
life in a bush is more precious than an incorporeal state <span
id="fr_1731"></span>[1733](#fn_1731.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p11"></span>6. It has been shown that the process
of deterioration which takes place in the soul will probably be extended
downwards; and lower than the insensible we find the inanimate, to
which, by consequence, the principle of their doctrine brings the soul:
but as they will not have this, they either exclude the soul from
insensibility, or, if they are to bring it back to human life, they
must, as has been said, declare the life of a tree to be preferable to
the original state—if, that is, the fall towards vice took place from
the one, and the return towards virtue takes place from the other.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p12"></span>7. Thus this doctrine of theirs,
which maintains that souls have a life by themselves before their life
in the flesh, and that they are by reason of wickedness bound to their
bodies, is shown to have neither beginning nor conclusion: and as for
those who assert that the soul is of later creation than the body, their
absurdity was already demonstrated above <span
id="fr_1732"></span>[1734](#fn_1732.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxix-p14"></span>8. The doctrine of both, then, is
equally to be rejected; but I think that we ought to direct our own
doctrine in the way of truth between these theories: and this doctrine
is that we are not to suppose, according to the error of the heathen
that the souls that revolve with the motion of the universe weighed down
by some wickedness, fall to earth by inability to keep up with the
swiftness of the motion of the spheres.
