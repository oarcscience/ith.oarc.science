<span id="xi.ii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xx-p2.1"></span>And</span> yet it is perhaps straining too far
for those who do believe that God sojourned here in life to object to
the manner of His appearance <span id="fr_1984"></span>[1986](#fn_1984)
, as wanting wisdom or conspicuous reasonableness. For to those who are
not vehemently antagonistic to the truth there exists no slight proof of
the Deity having sojourned here; I mean that which is exhibited now in
this present life before the life to come begins, the testimony which is
borne by actual facts. For who is there that does not know that every
part of the world was overspread with demoniacal delusion which mastered
the life of man through the madness of idolatry; how this was the
customary rule among all nations, to worship demons under the form of
idols, with the sacrifice of living animals and the polluted offerings
on their altars? But from the time when, as says the Apostle, “the grace
of God that bringeth salvation to all men appeared <span
id="fr_1985"></span>[1987](#fn_1985) ,” and dwelt among us in His human
nature, all these things passed away like smoke into nothingness, the
madness of their oracles and prophesyings ceased, the annual pomps and
pollutions of their bloody hecatombs came to an end, while among most
nations altars entirely disappeared, together with porches, precincts,
and shrines, and all the ritual besides which was followed out by the
attendant priest of those demons, to the deception both of themselves
and of all who came in their way. So that in many of these places no
memorial exists of these things having ever been. But, instead,
throughout the whole world there have arisen in the name of Jesus
temples and altars and a holy and unbloody Priesthood <span
id="fr_1986"></span>[1988](#fn_1986) , and a sublime philosophy, which
teaches, by deed and example more than by word, a disregard of this
bodily life and a contempt of death, a contempt which they whom tyrants
have tried to force to apostatize from the faith have manifestly
displayed, making no account of the cruelties done to their bodies or of
their doom of death: and yet, plainly, it was not likely that they would
have submitted to such treatment unless they had had a clear and
indisputable proof of that Divine Sojourn among men. And the following
fact is, further, a sufficient mark, as against the Jews, of the
presence among them <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1989](#fn_1987) of Him in
Whom they disbelieve; up to the time of the manifestation of Christ the
royal palaces in Jerusalem were in all their splendour: there was their
far-famed Temple; there was the customary round of their sacrifices
throughout the year: all the things, which had been expressed by the Law
in symbols to those who knew how to read its secrets, were up to that
point of time unbroken in their observance, in accordance with that form
of worship which had been established from the beginning. But when at
length they saw Him Whom they were looking for, and of Whom by their
Prophets and the Law they had before been told, and when they held in
more estimation than faith in Him Who had so manifested Himself that
which for the future became but a degraded superstition, because they
took it in a wrong sense <span id="fr_1988"></span>[1990](#fn_1988) ,
and clung to the mere phrases of the Law in obedience to the dictates of
custom rather than of intelligence, and when they had <span
id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span id="xi.ii.xx-Page_491"></span>thus
refused the grace which had appeared,—then even <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1991](#fn_1989) those holy monuments of their
religion were left standing, as they do, in history alone; for no traces
even of their Temple can be recognized, and their splendid city has been
left in ruins, so that there remains to the Jews nothing of the ancient
institutions; while by the command of those who rule over them the very
ground of Jerusalem which they so venerated is forbidden to them.

This is the preferable rendering; not as in the A.V., “appeared to all
men.”

class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xx-p5.2"></span>ναίμακτον

<span class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xx-p5.3"></span>θυσίαν</span>, is
supported by the Codd. The Eucharist is often called by the Fathers “the
unbloody sacrifice” (*e.g.* Chrysost. in [Ps.
xcv.](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#000)<span id="xi.ii.xx-p5.4"></span>,
citing Malachi), and the Priesthood which offers it can be called
“unbloody” too. Cf. Greg. Naz. in *Poem.* xi. 1—

<span id="xi.ii.xx-p6"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xx-p6.1"></span>῏</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xx-p6.2"></span>Ω θυσίας πέμποντες ἀναιμάκτους ἱερῆες</span>.

<span id="xi.ii.xx-p7"></span>While these terms assert the sacrificial
nature of the Eucharist, might they not at the same time supply an
argument against the Roman view of Transubstantiation, which teaches
that the actual blood of Christ is received, and makes it still a bloody
sacrifice?

<span id="xi.ii.xx-p8"></span> *of the presence among them,* &c. Cf. a
striking passage in Origen; “One amongst the convincing proofs that
Jesus was something Divine and holy is this; that the Jews after what
they did to Him have suffered so many terrible afflictions for so long.
And *we shall be bold to say that they never will be restored again.*
They have committed the most impious of crimes. They plotted against the
Saviour of mankind in that city where the ceremonies they continually
performed for God enshrined great mysteries. It was right that that city
where Jesus suffered should be utterly destroyed, and the Jewish nation
expelled, and that God’s call to blessedness should be made to others, I
mean the Christians, to whom have passed the doctrines of a religion of
stainless purity, and who have received new laws fitted for any form of
government that exists” (*c. Celsum,* iv. 22). The Jews, he says, will
even “suffer more than others in the judgment which they anticipate, in
addition to what they have suffered already,” ii. 8. But he says, v. 43,
“Would that they had not committed the error of having broken their own
law; first killing their prophets, and at last taking Jesus by stealth;
for then we should still have amongst us the model of that heavenly city
which Plato attempted to sketch, though I cannot say that his powers
came up to those of Moses and his successors.”

id="xi.ii.xx-p9.2"></span>λαμβάνειν</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xx-p9.3"></span>μεταλαμβάνειν</span> also have this meaning
“interpret,” “accipere”). This is a better reading than <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xx-p9.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xx-p9.5"></span>κβαλόντες</span>, and is
supported by two <span class="c22"><span
