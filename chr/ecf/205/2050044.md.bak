<span id="viii.i.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> §28. *He falsely imagines that
we can have an unalterable series of harmonious natures existing side by
side.*

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>But this man of science still
declares that varied works have energies as varied to produce them.
Either he knows not yet the nature of the Divine energy, as taught by
Scripture,—‘All things were made by the word of His command,’—or else he
is blind to the differences of existing things. He utters for our
benefit these inconsiderate statements, and lays down the law about
divine doctrines, as if he had never yet heard that anything that is
merely asserted,—where no entirely undeniable and plain statement is
made about the matter in hand, and where the asserter says on his own
responsibility that which a cautious listener cannot assent to,—is no
better than a telling of dreams or of stories over wine. Little then as
this dictum of his fits facts, nevertheless,—like one who is deluded by
a dream into thinking that he sees one of the objects of his waking
efforts, and who grasps eagerly at this phantom and <span
id="page_LXXIII">p. LXXIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xxviii-Page_LXXIII"></span>with eyes deceived by this
visionary desire thinks that he holds it,—he with this dreamlike outline
of doctrines before him imagines that his words possess force, and
insists upon their truth, and essays by them to prove all the rest. It
is worth while to give the passage. “These being so, and maintaining an
unbroken connexion in their relation to each other, it seems fitting for
those who make their investigation according to the order germane to the
subject, and who do not insist on mixing and confusing all together, in
case of a discussion being raised about Being, to prove what is in
course of demonstration, and to settle the points in debate, by the
primary energies and those attached to the Beings, and again to explain
by the Being when the energies are in question.” I think the actual
phrases of his impiety are enough to prove how absurd is this teaching.
If any one had to give a description of the way some disease mars a
human countenance, he would explain it better by actually unbandaging
the patient, and there would be then no need of words when the eye had
seen how he looked. So some mental eye might discern the hideous
mutilation wrought by this heresy: its mere perusal might remove the
veil. But since it is necessary, in order to make the latent mischief of
this teaching clear to the many, to put the finger of demonstration upon
it, I will again repeat each word. “This being so.” What does this
dreamer mean? What is ‘this?’ How has it been stated? “The Father’s
being is alone proper and in the highest degree supreme; consequently
the next being is dependent, and the third more dependent still.” In
such words he lays down the law. But why? Is it because an energy
accompanies the first being, of which the effect and work, the
Only-begotten, is circumscribed by the sphere of this producing cause?
Or because these Beings are to be thought of as of greater or less
extent, the smaller included within and surrounded by the larger, like
casks put one inside the other, inasmuch as he detects degrees of size
within Beings that are illimitable? Or because differences of products
imply differences of producers, as if it were impossible that different
effects should be produced by similar energies? Well, there is no one
whose mental faculties are so steeped in sleep as to acquiesce directly
after hearing such statements in the following assertion, “these being
so, and maintaining an unbroken connexion in their relation to one
another.” It is equal madness to say such things, and to hear them
without any questioning. They are placed in a ‘series’ and ‘an
unalterable relation to each other,’ and yet they are parted from each
other by an essential unlikeness! Either, as our own doctrine insists,
they are united in being, and then they really preserve an unalterable
relation to each other; or else they stand apart in essential
unlikeness, as he fancies. But what series, what relationship that is
unalterable can exist with alien entities? And how can they present that
‘order germane to the matter’ which according to him is to rule the
investigation? Now if he had an eye only on the doctrine of the truth,
and if the order in which he counts the differences was only that of the
attributes which Faith sees in the Holy Trinity,—an order so ‘natural’
and ‘germane’ that the Persons cannot be confounded, being divided as
Persons, though united in their being—then he would not have been
classed at all amongst our enemies, for he would mean the very same
doctrine that we teach. But, as it is, he is looking in the very
contrary direction, and he makes the order which he fancies *there*
quite inconceivable. There is all the difference in the world between
the accomplishment of an act of the will, and that of a mechanical law
of nature. Heat is inherent in fire, splendour in the sunbeam, fluidity
in water, downward tendency in a stone, and so on. But if a man builds a
house, or seeks an office, or puts to sea with a cargo, or attempts
anything else which requires forethought and preparation to succeed, we
cannot say in such a case that there is properly a rank or order
inherent in his operations: their order in each case will result as an
after consequence of the motive which guided his choice, or the utility
of that which he achieves. Well, then; since this heresy parts the Son
from any essential relationship with the Father, and adopts the same
view of the Spirit as estranged from any union with the Father or the
Son, and since also it affirms throughout that the Son is the work of
the Father, and the Spirit the work of the Son, and that these works are
the results of a purpose, not of nature, what grounds has he for
declaring that this work of a will is an ‘order inherent in the matter,’
and what is the drift of this teaching, which makes the Almighty the
manufacturer of such a nature as this in the Son and the Holy Spirit,
where transcendent beings are made such as to be inferior the one to the
other? If such is really his meaning, why did he not clearly state the
grounds he has for presuming in the case of the Deity, that smallness of
result will be evidence of all the greater power? But who really could
ever allow that a cause that is great and powerful is to be looked for
in this smallness of results? As if God was unable to establish His own
perfection in anything <span id="page_LXXIV">p. LXXIV</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xxviii-Page_LXXIV"></span>that comes from Him <span
id="fr_160"></span>[162](#fn_160.md) ! And how can he attribute to the
Deity the highest prerogative of supremacy while he exhibits His power
as thus falling short of His will? Eunomius certainly seems to mean that
perfection was not even proposed as the aim of God’s work, for fear the
honour and glory of One to Whom homage is due for His superiority might
be thereby lessened. And yet is there any one so narrow-minded as to
reckon the Blessed Deity Himself as not free from the passion of envy?
What plausible reason, then, is left why the Supreme Deity should have
constituted such an ‘order’ in the case of the Son and the Spirit? “But
I did not mean that ‘order’ to come from Him,” he rejoins. But whence
else, if the beings to which this ‘order’ is connatural are not
essentially related to each other? But perhaps he calls the inferiority
itself of the being of the Son and of the Spirit this ‘connatural
order.’ But I would beg of him to tell me the reason of this very thing,
viz., why the Son is inferior on the score of being, when both this
being and energy are to be discovered in the same characteristics and
attributes. If on the other hand there is not to be the same <span
id="fr_161"></span>[163](#fn_161.md) definition of being and energy, and
each is to signify something different, why does he introduce a
demonstration of the thing in question by means of that which is quite
different from it? It would be, in that case, just as if, when it was
debated with regard to man’s own being whether he were a risible animal,
or one capable of being taught to read, some one was to adduce the
building of a house or ship on the part of a mason or a shipwright as a
settling of the question, insisting on the skilful syllogism that we
know beings by operations, and a house and a ship are operations of man.
Do we then learn, most simple sir, by such premisses, that man is
risible as well as broad-nailed? Some one might well retort; ‘whether
man possesses motion and energy was not the question: it was, what is
the energizing principle itself; and that I fail to learn from your way
of deciding the question.’ Indeed, if we wanted to know something about
the nature of the wind, you would not give a satisfactory answer by
pointing to a heap of sand or chaff raised by the wind, or to dust which
it scattered: for the account to be given of the wind is quite
different: and these illustrations of yours would be foreign to the
subject. What ground, then, has he for attempting to explain beings by
their energies, and making the definition of an entity out of the
resultants of that entity.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxviii-p5"></span>Let us observe, too, what sort of
work of the Father it is by which the Father’s being, according to him,
is to be comprehended. The Son most certainly, he will say, if he says
as usual. But this Son of yours, most learned sir, is commensurate in
your scheme only with the energy which produced Him, and indicates that
alone, while the Object of our search still keeps in the dark, if, as
you yourself confess, this energy is only one amongst the things which
‘follow <span id="fr_162"></span>[164](#fn_162.md) ’ the first being. This
energy, as you say, extends itself into the work which it produces, but
it does not reveal therein even its own nature, but only so much of it
as we can get a glimpse of in that work. All the resources of a smith
are not set in motion to make a gimlet; the skill of that artisan only
operates so far as is adequate to form that tool, though it could
fashion a large variety of other tools. Thus the limit of the energy is
to be found in the work which it produces. But the question now is not
about the amount of the energy, but about the being of that which has
put forth the energy. In the same way, if he asserts that he can
perceive the nature of the Only-begotten in the Spirit (Whom he styles
the work of an energy which ‘follows’ the Son), his assertion has no
foundation; for here again the energy, while it extends itself into its
work, does not reveal therein the nature either of itself or of the
agent who exerts it.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxviii-p7"></span>But let us yield in this; grant
him that beings are known in their energies. The First being is known
through His work; and this Second being is revealed in the work
proceeding from *Him*. But what, my learned friend, is to show this
Third being? No such work of this Third is to be found. If you insist
that these beings are perceived by their energies, you must confess that
the Spirit’s nature is imperceptible; you cannot infer His nature from
any energy put forth by Him to carry on the continuity. Show some
substantiated work of the Spirit, through which you think you have
detected the being of the Spirit, or all your cobweb will collapse at
the touch of Reason. If the being is known by the subsequent energy, and
substantiated energy of the Spirit there is none, such as ye say the
Father shows in the Son, and the Son in the Spirit, then the nature of
the Spirit must be confessed unknowable and not be apprehended through
these; there is no energy conceived of in connexion with a substance to
show even a side glimpse of it. But if the Spirit eludes apprehension,
how <span id="page_LXXV">p. LXXV</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xxviii-Page_LXXV"></span>by means of that which is itself
imperceptible can the more exalted being be perceived? If the Son’s
work, that is, the Spirit according to them, is unknowable, the Son
Himself can never be known; He will be involved in the obscurity of that
which gives evidence of Him: and if the being of the Son in this way is
hidden, how can the being who is most properly such and most supreme be
brought to light by means of the being which is itself hidden; this
obscurity of the Spirit is transmitted by retrogression <span
id="fr_163"></span>[165](#fn_163.md) through the Son to the Father; so that
in this view, even by our adversaries’ confession, the unknowableness of
the Fathers being is clearly demonstrated. How, then, can this man, be
his eye ever so ‘keen to see unsubstantial entities,’ discern the nature
of the unseen and incomprehensible by means of itself; and how can he
command us to grasp the beings by means of their works, and their works
again from them?
