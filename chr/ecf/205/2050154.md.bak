<span id="ix.ii.ii.v"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> we need no longer show in this
narrow way the drawback of this life, as if the number of its ills was
limited to adulteries, dissensions, and plots. I think we should take
the higher and truer view, and say at once that none of that evil in
life, which is visible in all its business and in all its pursuits, can
have any hold over a man, if he will not put himself in the fetters of
this course. The truth of what we say will be clear thus. A man who,
seeing through the illusion with the eye of his spirit purged, lifts
himself above the struggling world, and, to use the words of the
Apostle, slights it all as but dung, in a way exiling himself altogether
from human life by his abstinence from marriage,—that man has no
fellowship whatever with the sins of mankind, such as avarice, envy,
anger, hatred, and everything of the kind. He has an exemption from all
this, and is in every way free and at peace; there is nothing in him to
provoke his neighbours’ envy, because he clutches none of those objects
round which envy in this life gathers. He has raised his own life above
the world, and prizing virtue as his only precious possession he will
pass his days in painless peace and quiet. For virtue is a possession
which, though all according to their capacity should share it, yet will
be always in abundance for those who thirst after it; unlike the
occupation of the lands on this earth, which men divide into sections,
and the more they add to the one the more they take from the other, so
that the one person’s gain is his fellow’s loss; whence arise the fights
for the lion’s share, from men’s hatred of being cheated. But the larger
owner of *this* possession is never envied; he who snatches the lion’s
share does no damage to him who claims equal participation; as each is
capable each has this noble longing satisfied, while the wealth of
virtues in those who are already occupiers <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[1360](#fn_1358.md) is not exhausted. The man, then,
who, with his eyes only on such a life, makes virtue, which has no limit
that man can devise, his only treasure, will surely never brook to bend
his soul to any of those low courses which multitudes tread. He will not
admire earthly riches, or human power, or any of those things which
folly seeks. If, indeed, his mind is still pitched so low, he is outside
our band of novices, and our words <span id="page_349">p. 349</span>
<span id="ix.ii.ii.v-Page_349"></span>do not apply to him. But if his
thoughts are above, walking as it were with God, he will be lifted out
of the maze of all these errors; for the predisposing cause of them all,
marriage, has not touched him. Now the wish to be before others is the
deadly sin of pride, and one would not be far wrong in saying that this
is the seed-root of all the thorns of sin; but it is from reasons
connected with marriage that this pride mostly begins. To show what I
mean, we generally find the grasping man throwing the blame on his
nearest kin; the man mad after notoriety and ambition generally makes
his family responsible for this sin: “he must not be thought inferior to
his forefathers; he must be deemed a great man by the generation to come
by leaving his children historic records of himself”: so also the other
maladies of the soul, envy, spite, hatred and such-like, are connected
with this cause; they are to be found amongst those who are eager about
the things of this life. He who has fled from it gazes as from some high
watch-tower on the prospect of humanity, and pities these slaves of
vanity for their blindness in setting such a value on bodily well-being.
He sees some distinguished person giving himself airs because of his
public honours, and wealth, and power, and only laughs at the folly of
being so puffed up. He gives to the years of human life the longest
number, according to the Psalmist’s computation, and then compares this
atom-interval with the endless ages, and pities the vain glory of those
who excite themselves for such low and petty and perishable things.
What, indeed, amongst the things here is there enviable in that which so
many strive for,—honour? What is gained by those who win it? The mortal
remains mortal whether he is honoured or not. What good does the
possessor of many acres gain in the end? Except that the foolish man
thinks his own that which never belongs to him, ignorant seemingly in
his greed that “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[1361](#fn_1359.md) ,” for “God is king of all the
earth <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1362](#fn_1360.md) .” It is the passion of
having which gives men a false title of lordship over that which can
never belong to them. “The earth,” says the wise Preacher, “abideth for
ever <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1363](#fn_1361.md) ,” ministering to every
generation, first one, then another, that is born upon it; but men,
though they are so little even their own masters, that they are brought
into life without knowing it by their Maker’s will, and before they wish
are withdrawn from it, nevertheless in their excessive vanity think that
they are her lords; that they, now born, now dying, rule that which
remains continually. One who reflecting on this holds cheaply all that
mankind prizes, whose only love is the divine life, because “all flesh
is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[1364](#fn_1362.md) ,” can never care for this grass
which “to-day is and to-morrow is not”; studying the divine ways, he
knows not only that human life has no fixity, but that the entire
universe will not keep on its quiet course for ever; he neglects his
existence here as an alien and a passing thing; for the Saviour said,
“Heaven and earth shall pass away <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1365](#fn_1363.md) ,” the whole of necessity awaits
its refashioning. As long as he is “in this tabernacle <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1366](#fn_1364.md) ,” exhibiting mortality, weighed
down with this existence, he laments the lengthening of his sojourn in
it; as the Psalmist-poet says in his heavenly songs. Truly, they live in
darkness who sojourn in these living tabernacles; wherefore that
preacher, groaning at the continuance of this sojourn, says, “Woe is me
that my sojourn is prolonged <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1367](#fn_1365.md)
,” and he attributes the cause of his dejection to “darkness”; for we
know that darkness is called in the Hebrew language “kedar.” It is
indeed a darkness as of the night which envelops mankind, and prevents
them seeing this deceit and knowing that all which is most prized by the
living, and moreover all which is the reverse, exists only in the
conception of the unreflecting, and is in itself nothing; there is no
such reality anywhere as obscurity of birth, or illustrious birth, or
glory, or splendour, or ancient renown, or present elevation, or power
over others, or subjection. Wealth and comfort, poverty and distress,
and all the other inequalities of life, seem to the ignorant, applying
the test of pleasure, vastly different from each other. But to the
higher understanding they are all alike; one is not of greater value
than the other; because life runs on to the finish with the same speed
through all these opposites, and in the lots of either class there
remains the same power of choice to live well or ill, “through armour on
the right hand and on the left, through evil report and good
report <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1368](#fn_1366.md) .” Therefore the
clearseeing mind which measures reality will journey on its path without
turning, accomplishing its appointed time from its birth to its exit; it
is neither softened by the pleasures nor beaten down by the hardships;
but, as is the way with travellers, it keeps advancing always, and takes
but little notice of the views presented. It is the travellers way to
press on to their journey’s end, no matter whether they are passing
through meadows and cultivated farms, or through wilder and more rugged
spots; a smiling landscape does not detain them; nor a gloomy one check
their speed. So, too, that lofty mind will press straight on to its
self-imposed end, <span id="page_350">p. 350</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.v-Page_350"></span>not turning aside to see anything on the
way. It passes through life, but its gaze is fixed on heaven; it is the
good steersman directing the bark to some landmark there. But the
grosser mind looks down; it bends its energies to bodily pleasures as
surely as the sheep stoop to their pasture; it lives for gorging and
still lower pleasures <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1369](#fn_1367.md) ; it is
alienated from the life of God <span
id="fr_1368"></span>[1370](#fn_1368.md) , and a stranger to the promise of
the Covenants; it recognizes no good but the gratification of the body.
It is a mind such as this that “walks in darkness <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1371](#fn_1369.md) ,” and invents all the evil in this
life of ours; avarice, passions unchecked, unbounded luxury, lust of
power, vain-glory, the whole mob of moral diseases that invade men’s
homes. In these vices, one somehow holds closely to another; where one
has entered all the rest seem to follow, dragging each other in a
natural order, just as in a chain, when you have jerked the first link,
the others cannot rest, and even the link at the other end feels the
motion of the first, which passes thence by virtue of their contiguity
through the intervening links; so firmly are men’s vices linked together
by their very nature; when one of them has gained the mastery of a soul,
the rest of the train follow. If you want a graphic picture of this
accursed chain, suppose a man who because of some special pleasure it
gives him is a victim to his thirst for fame; then a desire to increase
his fortune follows close upon this thirst for fame; he becomes
grasping; but only because the first vice leads him on to this. Then
this grasping after money and superiority engenders either anger with
his kith and kin, or pride towards his inferiors, or envy of those above
him; then hypocrisy comes in after this envy; a soured temper after
that; a misanthropical spirit after that; and behind them all a state of
condemnation which ends in the dark fires of hell. You see the chain;
how all follows from one cherished passion. Seeing, then, that this
inseparable train of moral diseases has entered once for all into the
world, one single way of escape is pointed out to us in the exhortations
of the inspired writings; and that is to separate ourselves from the
life which involves this sequence of sufferings. If we haunt Sodom, we
cannot escape the rain of fire; nor if one who has fled out of her looks
back upon her desolation, can he fail to become a pillar of salt rooted
to the spot. We cannot be rid of the Egyptian bondage, unless we leave
Egypt, that is, this life that lies under water <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1372](#fn_1370.md) , and pass, not that Red Sea, but
this black and gloomy Sea of life. But suppose we remain in this evil
bondage, and, to use the Master’s words, “the truth shall not have made
us free,” how can one who seeks a lie and wanders in the maze of this
world ever come to the truth? How can one who has surrendered his
existence to be chained by nature run away from this captivity? An
illustration will make our meaning clearer. A winter torrent <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1373](#fn_1371.md) , which, impetuous in itself,
becomes swollen and carries down beneath its stream trees and boulders
and anything that comes in its way, is death and danger to those alone
who live along its course; for those who have got well out of its way it
rages in vain. Just so, only the man who lives in the turmoil of life
has to feel its force; only he has to receive those sufferings which
nature’s stream, descending in a flood of troubles, must, to be true to
its kind, bring to those who journey on its banks. But if a man leaves
this torrent, and these “proud waters <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1374](#fn_1372.md) ,” he will escape from being “a
prey to the teeth” of this life, as the Psalm goes on to say, and, as “a
bird from the snare,” on virtue’s wings. This simile, then, of the
torrent holds; human life *is* a tossing and tumultuous stream sweeping
down to find its natural level; none of the objects sought for in it
last till the seekers are satisfied; all that is carried to them by this
stream comes near, just touches them, and passes on; so that the present
moment in this impetuous flow eludes enjoyment, for the after-current
snatches it from their view. It would be our interest therefore to keep
far away from such a stream, lest, engaged on temporal things, we should
neglect eternity. How can a man keep for ever anything here, be his love
for it never so passionate? Which of life’s most cherished objects
endures always? What flower of prime? What gift of strength and beauty?
What wealth, or fame, or power? They all have their transient bloom, and
then melt away into their opposites. Who can continue in life’s prime?
Whose strength lasts for ever? Has not Nature made the bloom of beauty
even more short-lived than the shows of spring? For they blossom in
their season, and after withering for a while again revive; after
another shedding they are again in leaf, and retain their beauty of
to-day to a late prime. But Nature exhibits the human bloom only in the
spring of early life; then she kills it; it is vanished in the frosts of
age. All other delights also deceive the bodily eye for a time, and then
pass behind the veil of oblivion. Nature’s inevitable changes are many;
they agonize him whose love is passionate. One way of escape is open: it
is, to be attached to none of these things, and to get as far away as
<span id="page_351">p. 351</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.v-Page_351"></span>possible from the society of this
emotional and sensual world; or rather, for a man to go outside the
feelings which his own body gives rise to. Then, as he does not live for
the flesh, he will not be subject to the troubles of the flesh. But this
amounts to living for the spirit only, and imitating all we can the
employment of the world of spirits. There they neither marry, nor are
given in marriage. Their work and their excellence is to contemplate the
Father of all purity, and to beautify the lines of their own character
from the Source of all beauty, so far as imitation of It is possible.
