id="xiii.xix-p1.1"></span>Letter XVIII</span>.—*To Flavian* <span
id="fr_2257"></span>[2259](#fn_2257.md) .

<span id="xiii.xix-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.xix-p3.1"></span>Things</span> with us, O man of God, are not
in a good way. The development of the bad feeling existing amongst
certain persons who have conceived a most groundless and unaccountable
hatred of us is no longer a matter of mere conjecture; it is now evinced
with an earnestness and openness worthy only of some holy work. You
meanwhile, who have hitherto been beyond the reach of such annoyance,
are too remiss in stifling the devouring conflagration on your
neighbour’s land; yet those who are well-advised for their own interests
really do take pains to check a fire close to them, securing themselves,
by this help given to a neighbour, against ever needing help in like
circumstances. Well, you will ask, what do I complain of? Piety has
vanished from the world; Truth has fled from our midst; as for Peace, we
used to have the name at all events going the round upon men’s lips; but
now not only does she herself cease to exist, but we do not even retain
the word that expresses her. But that you may know more exactly the
things that move our indignation, I will briefly detail to you the whole
tragic story.

<span id="xiii.xix-p4"></span>Certain persons had informed me that the
Right Reverend Helladius had unfriendly feelings towards me, and that he
enlarged in conversation to every one upon the troubles that I had
brought upon him. I did not at first believe what they said, judging
only from myself, and the actual truth of the matter. But when every one
kept bringing to us a tale of the same strain, and facts besides
corroborated their report, I thought it my duty not to continue to
overlook this ill-feeling, while it was still without root and
development. I therefore wrote by letter to your piety, and to many
others who could help me in my intention, and stimulated your zeal in
this matter. At last, after I had concluded the services at Sebasteia
in <span id="fr_2258"></span>[2260](#fn_2258.md) commemoration of
Peter <span id="fr_2259"></span>[2261](#fn_2259.md) of most blessed memory,
and of the holy martyrs, who had lived in his times, and whom the people
were accustomed to commemorate with him, I was returning to my own See,
when some one told me that Helladius himself was in the neighbouring
mountain district, holding martyrs’ memorial services. At first I held
on my journey, judging it more proper that our meeting should take place
in the metropolis itself. But when one of his relations took the trouble
to meet me, and to assure me that he was sick, I left my carriage at the
spot where this news arrested me; I performed on horseback the
intervening journey over a road that was like a precipice, and well-nigh
impassable with its rocky ascents. Fifteen milestones measured the
distance we had to traverse. Painfully travelling, now on foot, now
mounted, in the early morning, and even employing some part of the
night, I arrived between twelve and one o’clock at Andumocina; for that
was the name of the place where, with two other bishops, he was holding
his conference. From a shoulder of the hill overhanging this village, we
looked down, while still at a distance, upon this outdoor assemblage of
the Church. Slowly, and on foot, and leading the horses, I and my
company passed over the intervening ground, and we arrived at the
chapel <span id="fr_2260"></span>[2262](#fn_2260.md) just as he had retired
to his residence.

<span id="xiii.xix-p8"></span>Without any delay a messenger was
despatched to inform him of our being there; and a very short while
after, the deacon in attendance on him met us, and we requested him to
tell Helladius at once, so that we might spend as much time as possible
with him, and so have an opportunity of leaving nothing in the
misunderstanding between us unhealed. As for myself, I then remained
sitting, still in the open air, and waited for the invitation indoors;
and at a most inopportune time I became, as I sat there, a gazing stock
to all the visitors at the conference. The time was long; drowsiness
came on, and languor, intensified by the fatigue of the journey and the
excessive heat of the day; and all these things, with people staring at
me, and pointing me out to others, were so very distressing that in me
the words of the prophet were realized: “My spirit within me was
desolate <span id="fr_2261"></span>[2263](#fn_2261.md) .” I was kept <span
id="page_546">p. 546</span> <span id="xiii.xix-Page_546"></span>in this
state till noon, and heartily did I repent of this visit, and that I had
brought upon myself this piece of discourtesy; and my own reflection
vexed me worse than this injury done me by my enemies <span
id="fr_2262"></span>[2264](#fn_2262.md) , warring as it did against itself,
and changing into a regret that I had made the venture. At last the
approach to the Altars was thrown open, and we were admitted to the
sanctuary; the crowd, however, were excluded, though my deacon entered
along with me, supporting with his arm my exhausted frame. I addressed
his Lordship, and stood for a moment, expecting from him an invitation
to be seated; but when nothing of the kind was heard from him, I turned
towards one of the distant seats, and rested myself upon it, still
expecting that he would utter something that was friendly, or at all
events kind; or at least give one nod of recognition.

<span id="xiii.xix-p11"></span>Any hopes I had were doomed to complete
disappointment. There ensued a silence dead as night, and looks as
downcast as in tragedy, and daze, and dumbfoundedness, and perfect
dumbness. A long interval of time it was, dragged out as if it were in
the blackness of night. So struck down was I by this reception, in which
he did not deign to accord me the merest utterance even of those common
salutations by which you discharge the courtesies of a chance
meeting <span id="fr_2263"></span>[2265](#fn_2263.md) ,—“welcome,” for
instance, or “where do you come from?” or “to what am I indebted for
this pleasure?” or “on what important business are you here?”—that I was
inclined to make this spell of silence into a picture of the life led in
the underworld. Nay, I condemn the similitude as inadequate. For in that
underworld the equality of conditions is complete, and none of the
things that cause the tragedies of life on earth disturb existence.
Their glory, as the Prophet says, does not follow men down there; each
individual soul, abandoning the things so eagerly clung to by the
majority here, his petulance, and pride, and conceit, enters that lower
world in simple unencumbered nakedness; so that none of the miseries of
this life are to be found among them. Still <span
id="fr_2264"></span>[2266](#fn_2264.md) , notwithstanding this reservation,
my condition then did appear to me like an underworld, a murky dungeon,
a gloomy torture-chamber; the more so, when I reflected what treasures
of social courtesies we have inherited from our fathers, and what
recorded deeds of it we shall leave to our descendants. Why, indeed,
should I speak at all of that affectionate disposition of our fathers
towards each other? No wonder that, being all naturally equal <span
id="fr_2265"></span>[2267](#fn_2265.md) , they wished for no advantage over
one another, but thought to exceed each other only in humility. But my
mind was penetrated most of all with this thought; that the Lord of all
creation, the Only-begotten Son, Who was in the bosom of the Father, Who
was in the beginning, Who was in the form of God, Who upholds all things
by the word of His power, humbled Himself not only in this respect, that
in the flesh He sojourned amongst men, but also that He welcomed even
Judas His own betrayer, when he drew near to kiss Him, on His blessed
lips; and that when He had entered into the house of Simon the leper He,
as loving all men, upbraided his host, that He had not been kissed by
him: whereas I was not reckoned by him as equal even to that leper; and
yet what was I, and what was he? I cannot discover any difference
between us. If one looks at it from the mundane point of view, where was
the height from which he had descended, where was the dust in which I
lay? If, indeed, one must regard things of this fleshly life, thus much
perhaps it will hurt no one’s feelings to assert that, looking at our
lineage, whether as noble or as free, our position was about on a par;
though, if one looked in either for the true freedom and nobility,
*i.e.* that of the soul, each of us will be found equally a bondsman of
Sin; each equally needs One Who will take away his sins; it was Another
Who ransomed us both from Death and Sin with His own blood, Who redeemed
us, and yet showed no contempt of those whom He has redeemed, calling
them though He does from deadness to life, and healing every infirmity
of their souls and bodies.

<span id="xiii.xix-p15"></span>Seeing, then, that the amount of this
conceit and overweening pride was so great, that even the height of
heaven was almost too narrow limits for it (and yet I could see no cause
or occasion whatever for this diseased state of mind, such as might make
it excusable in the case of some who in certain circumstances contract
it; when, for instance, rank or education, or pre-eminence in dignities
of office may have happened to inflate the vainer minds), I had no means
whereby to advise myself to keep quiet: for my heart within me was
swelling with indignation at the absurdity of the whole proceeding, and
was rejecting all the reasons for enduring it. Then, if ever, did I feel
admiration for that divine Apostle who so vividly depicts the civil war
that rages within us, declaring that there is a certain “law of sin in
the members, warring against the law of the <span id="page_547">p.
547</span> <span id="xiii.xix-Page_547"></span>mind,” and often making
the mind a captive, and a slave as well, to itself. This was the very
array, in opposition, of two contending feelings that I saw within
myself: the one, of anger at the insult caused by pride, the other
prompting to appease the rising storm. When by God’s grace, the worse
inclination had failed to get the mastery, I at last said to him, “But
is it, then, that some one of the things required for your personal
comfort is being hindered by our presence, and is it time that we
withdrew?” On his declaring that he had no bodily needs, I spoke to him
some words calculated to heal, so far as in me lay, his ill-feeling.
When he had, in a very few words, declared that the anger he felt
towards me was owing to many injuries done him, I for my part answered
him thus: “Lies possess an immense power amongst mankind to deceive: but
in the Divine Judgment there will be no place for the misunderstandings
thus arising. In my relations towards yourself, my conscience is bold
enough to prompt me to hope that I may obtain forgiveness for all my
other sins, but that, if I have acted in any way to harm you, this may
remain for ever unforgiven.” He was indignant at this speech, and did
not suffer the proofs of what I had said to be added.

<span id="xiii.xix-p16"></span>It was now past six o’clock, and the bath
had been well prepared, and the banquet was being spread, and the day
was the sabbath <span id="fr_2266"></span>[2268](#fn_2266.md) , and a
martyr’s commemoration. Again observe how this disciple of the Gospel
imitates the Lord of the Gospel: He, when eating and drinking with
publicans and sinners, answered to those who found fault with Him that
He did it for love of mankind: this disciple considers it a sin and a
pollution to have us at his board, even after all that fatigue which we
underwent on the journey, after all that excessive heat out of doors, in
which we were baked while sitting at his gates; after all that gloomy
sullenness with which he treated us to the bitter end, when we had come
into his presence. He sends us off to toil painfully, with a frame now
thoroughly exhausted with the over-fatigue, over the same distance, the
same route: so that we scarcely reached our travelling company at
sunset, after we had suffered many mishaps on the way. For a
storm-cloud, gathered into a mass in the clear air by an eddy of wind,
drenched us to the skin with its floods of rain; for owing to the
excessive sultriness, we had made no preparation against any shower.
However, by God’s grace we escaped, though in the plight of shipwrecked
sailors from the waves: and right glad were we to reach our company.

<span id="xiii.xix-p18"></span>Having joined our forces we rested there
that night, and at last arrived alive in our own district; having reaped
in addition this result of our meeting him, that the memory of all that
had happened before was revived by this last insult offered to us; and,
you see, we are positively compelled to take measures, for the future,
on our own behalf, or rather on his behalf; for it was because his
designs were not checked on former occasions that he has proceeded to
this unmeasured display of vanity. Something, therefore, I think, must
be done on our part, in order that he may improve upon himself, and may
be taught that he is human, and has no authority to insult and to
disgrace those who possess the same beliefs and the same rank as
himself. For just consider; suppose we granted for a moment, for the
sake of argument, that it is true that I have done something that has
annoyed him, what trial <span id="fr_2267"></span>[2269](#fn_2267.md) was
instituted against us, to judge either of the fact or the hearsay? What
proofs were given of this supposed injury? What Canons were cited
against us? What legitimate episcopal decision confirmed any verdict
passed upon us? And supposing any of these processes had taken place,
and that in the proper way, my standing <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2270](#fn_2268.md) in the Church might certainly have
been at stake, but what Canons could have sanctioned insults offered to
a free-born person, and disgrace inflicted on one of equal rank with
himself? “Judge righteous judgment,” you who look to God’s law in this
matter; say wherein you deem this disgrace put upon us to be excusable.
If our dignity is to be estimated on the ground of priestly
jurisdiction, the privilege of each recorded by the Council <span
id="fr_2269"></span>[2271](#fn_2269.md) is one and the same; or rather the
oversight of Catholic correction <span
id="fr_2270"></span>[2272](#fn_2270.md) , from the fact that we possess an
equal share of it, is so. But if some are inclined to regard each of us
by himself, divested of any priestly dignity, in <span id="page_548">p.
548</span> <span id="xiii.xix-Page_548"></span>what respect has one any
advantage over the other; in education for instance, or in birth
connecting with the noblest and most illustrious lineage, or in
theology? These things will be found either equal, or at all events not
inferior, in me. “But what about revenue?” he will say. I would rather
not be obliged to speak of this in his case; thus much only it will
suffice to say, that our own was so much at the beginning, and is so
much now; and to leave it to others to enquire into the causes of this
increase of our revenue <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2273](#fn_2271.md) ,
nursed as it is up till now, and growing almost daily by means of noble
undertakings. What licence, then, has he to put an insult upon us,
seeing that he has neither superiority of birth to show, nor a rank
exalted above all others, nor a commanding power of speech, nor any
previous kindness done to me? While, even if he had all this to show,
the fault of having slighted those of gentle birth would still be
inexcusable. But he has not got it; and therefore I deem it right to see
that this malady of puffed-up pride is not left without a cure; and it
will be its cure to put it down to its proper level, and reduce its
inflated dimensions, by letting off a little of the conceit with which
he is bursting. The manner of effecting this we leave to God.

<span id="xiii.xix-p2"></span> The date of this letter is probably as
late as 393. Flavian’s authority at Antioch was now undisputed, by his
reconciliation, after the deaths of Paulinus and Evagrius, with the
Bishops of Alexandria and Rome, and, through them, with all his people.
Gregory writes to him not only as his dear friend, but one who had known
how to appease wrath, and to check opposition from the Emperor downward.
He died in 404. The litigiousness of Helladius is described by Greg.
Naz., Letter ccxv. He it was who a few years later, against Ambrose’s
authority, and for mere private interest, consecrated the physician
Gerontius (Sozomen, viii. 6).

<span id="xiii.xix-p17"></span> Cf. *Dies Dominica* (by Thomas Young,
tutor of Milton the poet): “It’s without controversie that the Oriental
Christians, and others, did at that time hold assemblies on the Sabbath
day.…Yet did they not hold the Sabbath day holy,” p. 35. Again,
“Socrates doth not record that they of Alexandria and Rome did celebrate
those mysteries on the Sabbath. While Chrysostom requireth it of the
rich Lords of Villages, that they build Churches in them (*Hom.* 18 *in
Act.*), he distinguisheth those congregations that were on other days
from those that were held upon the Lord’s day. ‘Upon those congregations
(<span class="Greek"><span id="xiii.xix-p17.1"></span>συνάξεις</span>)
Prayers and hymns were had, in these an oblation was made on every
Lord’s day,’ and for that cause the Lord’s day is in Chrysostom called,
‘dies panis’. Athanasius purgeth himself of a calumny imputed to him,
for breaking the cup, because it was not the time of administering the
holy mysteries; ‘for it is not,’ saith he, ‘the Lord’s day.’” A law of
Constantine had enacted that the first day of the week, “the Lord’s
day,” should be observed with greater solemnity than formerly; which
shows that the seventh day, the Sabbath, still held its place; and it
does not follow that in remoter places, as here, both were kept. The
hour of service was generally “in the evening after sunset; or in the
morning before the dawn,” Mosheim.
