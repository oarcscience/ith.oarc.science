<span id="xi.ii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>That</span> Deity should be born in our
nature, ought not reasonably to present any strangeness <span
id="page_495">p. 495</span> <span id="xi.ii.xxvii-Page_495"></span>to
the minds of those who do not take too narrow a view of things. For who,
when he takes a survey of the universe, is so simple as not to believe
that there is Deity in everything, penetrating it, embracing it, and
seated in it? For all things depend on Him Who is <span
id="fr_2000"></span>[2002](#fn_2000.md) , nor can there be anything which
has not its being in Him Who is. If, therefore, all things are in Him,
and He in all things, why are they scandalized at the plan of Revelation
when it teaches that God was born among men, that same God Whom we are
convinced is even now not outside mankind? For although this last form
of God’s presence amongst us is not the same as that former presence,
still His existence amongst us equally both then and now is evidenced;
only now He Who holds together Nature in existence is transfused in
*us;* while at that other time He was transfused throughout *our
nature*, in order that our nature might by this transfusion of the
Divine become itself divine, rescued as it was from death, and put
beyond the reach of the caprice of the antagonist. For His return from
death becomes to our mortal race the commencement of our return to the
immortal life.
