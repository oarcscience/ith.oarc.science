<span id="ii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="ii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii-p3.1"></span>These</span> translations from the works of St.
Gregory of Nyssa have involved unusual labour, which the Editor hopes
will be accepted as a sufficient apology for the delay of the volume.
The difficulty has been extreme of conveying with correctness in English
the meaning of expressions and arguments which depend on some of the
most subtle ideas of Greek philosophy and theology; and, in addition to
the thanks due to the translators, the Editor must offer a special
acknowledgment of the invaluable help he has received from the exact and
philosophical scholarship of the Rev. J. H. Lupton, Surmaster of St.
Paul’s School. He must renew to Mr. Lupton, with increased earnestness,
the expression of gratitude he had already had occasion to offer in
issuing the Translation of St. Athanasius. From the careful and minute
revision which the volume has thus undergone, the Editor ventures to
entertain some hope that the writings of this important and interesting
Father are in this volume introduced to the English reader in a manner
which will enable him to obtain a fair conception of their meaning and
value.
