<span id="viii.i.x.ii-p1"></span> §2. *He then discusses the “willing”
of the Father concerning the generation of the Son, and shows that the
object of that good will is from eternity, which is the Son, existing in
the Father, and being closely related to the process of willing, as the
ray to the flame, or the act of seeing to the eye.*

<span id="viii.i.x.ii-p2"></span>After these distinctions on our part no
one can well be longer in doubt how the Only-begotten at once is
believed to be “of the Father,” and *is* eternally, even if the one
phrase does not at first sight seem to agree with the other,—that which
declares Him to be “of the Father” with that which asserts His eternity.
But if we are to confirm our statement by further arguments, it may be
possible to apprehend the doctrine on this point by the aid of things
cognizable by our senses. And let no one deride our statement, if it
cannot find among existing things a likeness of the object of our
enquiry such as may be in all respects sufficient for the presentation
of the matter in hand by way of analogy and resemblance. For we should
like to persuade those who say that the Father first willed and so
proceeded to become a Father, and on this ground assert posteriority in
existence as regards the Word, by whatever illustrations may make it
possible, to turn to the orthodox view. Neither does this immediate
conjunction exclude the “willing” of the Father, in the sense that He
had a Son without choice, by some necessity of His Nature, nor does the
“willing” separate the Son from the Father, coming in between them as a
kind of interval: so that we neither reject from our doctrine the
“willing” of the Begetter directed to the Son, as being, so to say,
forced out by the conjunction of the Son’s oneness with the Father, nor
do we by any means break that inseparable connection, when “willing” is
regarded as involved in the generation. For to our heavy and inert
nature it properly belongs that the wish and the possession of a thing
are not often present with us at the same moment; but now we wish for
something we have not, and at another time we obtain what we do not wish
to obtain. But, in the case of the simple and all-powerful Nature, all
things are conceived together and at once, the willing of good as well
as the possession of what He wills. For the good and the eternal will is
contemplated as operating, indwelling, and co-existing in the eternal
Nature, not arising in it from any separate principle, nor capable of
being conceived apart from the object of will: for it is not possible
that with God either the good will should not be, or the object of will
should not accompany the act of will, since no cause can either bring it
about that that which befits the Father should not always be, or be any
hindrance to the possession of the object of will. Since, then, the
Only-begotten God is by nature the good (or rather beyond all good), and
since the good does not fail to be the object of the Father’s will, it
is hereby clearly shown, both that the conjunction of the Son with the
Father is without any intermediary, and also that the will, which is
always present in the good Nature, is not forced out nor excluded by
reason of this inseparable conjunction. And if any one is listening to
my argument in no scoffing spirit, I should like to add to what I have
already said something of the following kind.

<span id="viii.i.x.ii-p3"></span>Just as, if one were to grant (I speak,
of course, hypothetically) the power of deliberate choice to belong to
flame, it would be clear that the flame will at once upon its existence
*will* that its radiance should shine forth from itself, and when it
wills it will not be impotent (since, on the appearance of the flame,
its natural power at once fulfils its will in the matter of the
radiance), so that undoubtedly, if it be granted that the flame is moved
by deliberate choice, we conceive the concurrence of all these things
simultaneously—of the kindling of the fire, of its act of will
concerning the radiance, and of the radiance itself; so that the
movement by way of choice is no hindrance to the dignity of the
existence of the radiance,—even so, according to the illustration we
have spoken of, you will not, by confessing the good act of will <span
id="page_CCIII">p. CCIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.x.ii-Page_CCIII"></span>as existing in the Father, separate
by that act of will the Son from the Father. For it is not reasonable to
suppose that the act of willing that He should be, could be a hindrance
to His immediately coming into being; but just as, in the eye, seeing
and the will to see are, one an operation of nature, the other an
impulse of choice, yet no delay is caused to the act of sight by the
movement of choice in that particular direction <span
id="fr_863"></span>[865](#fn_863.md) ,—(for each of these is regarded
separately and by itself, not as being at all a hindrance to the
existence of the other, but as both being somehow interexistent, the
natural operation concurring with the choice, and the choice in turn not
failing to be accompanied by the natural motion)—as, I say, perception
naturally belongs to the eye, and the willing to see produces no delay
in respect to actual sight, but one wills that it should have vision,
and immediately what he wills *is,* so also in the case of that Nature
which is unspeakable and above all thought, our apprehension of all
comes together simultaneously—of the eternal existence of the Father,
and of an act of will concerning the Son, and of the Son Himself, Who
is, as John says, “in the beginning,” and is not conceived as coming
after the beginning. Now the beginning of all is the Father; but in this
beginning the Son also is declared to be, being in His Nature that very
thing which the Beginning is. For the Beginning is God, and the Word Who
“was in the Beginning” is God. As then the phrase “the beginning” points
to eternity, John well conjoins “the Word in the Beginning,” saying that
the Word was in It; asserting, I suppose, this fact to the end that the
first idea present to the mind of his hearer may not be “the Beginning”
alone by itself, but that, before this has been impressed upon him,
there should also be presented to his mind, together with the Beginning
the Word Who was in It, entering with It into the hearer’s
understanding, and being present to his hearing at the same time with
the Beginning.

[Next: Then, thus passing over what relates to the essence of the Son as
having been already discussed, he treats of the sense involved in
“generation,” saying that there are diverse generations, those effected
by matter and art, and of buildings,--and that by succession of
animals,--and those by efflux, as by the sun and its beam. The lamp and
its radiance, scents and ointments and the quality diffused by
them,--and the word produced by the mind; and cleverly discusses
generation from rotten wood; and from the condensation of fire, and
countless other causes.](2050113.md)
