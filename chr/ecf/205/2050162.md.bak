<span id="ix.ii.ii.xiii"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>This</span> reasoning and intelligent
creature, man, at once the work and the likeness of the Divine and
Imperishable Mind (for so in the Creation it is written of him that “God
made man in His image <span id="fr_1408"></span>[1410](#fn_1408) ”.md),
this creature, I say, did not in the course of his first production have
united to the very essence of his nature the liability to passion and to
death. Indeed, the truth about the image could never have been
maintained if the beauty reflected in that image had been in the
slightest degree opposed <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1411](#fn_1409.md) to
the Archetypal Beauty. Passion was introduced afterwards, subsequent to
man’s first organization; and it was in this way. Being the image and
the likeness, as has been said, of the Power which rules all things, man
kept also in the matter of a Free-Will this likeness to Him whose Will
is over all. He was enslaved to no outward necessity whatever; his
feeling towards that which pleased him depended only on his own private
judgment; he was free to choose whatever he liked; and so he was a free
agent, though circumvented with cunning, when he drew upon himself that
disaster which now overwhelms humanity. He became himself the discoverer
of evil, but he did not therein discover what God had made; for God did
not make death. Man became, in fact, himself the fabricator, to a
certain extent, and the craftsman of evil. All who have the faculty of
sight may enjoy equally the sunlight; and any one can if he likes put
this enjoyment from him by shutting his eyes: in that case it is not
that the sun retires and produces that darkness, but the man himself
puts a barrier between his eye and the sunshine; the faculty of vision
cannot indeed, even in the closing of the eyes, remain inactive <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1412](#fn_1410.md) , and so this operative sight
necessarily becomes an operative darkness <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1413](#fn_1411.md) rising up in the man from his own
free act in ceasing to see. Again, a man in building a house for himself
may omit to make in it any way of entrance for the light; he will
necessarily be in darkness, though he cuts himself off from the light
voluntarily. So the first man on the earth, or rather he who generated
evil in man, had for choice the Good and the Beautiful lying all around
him in the very nature of things; yet he wilfully cut out a new way for
himself against this nature, and in the act of turning away from virtue,
which was his own free act, he created the usage of evil. For, be it
observed, there is no such thing in the world as evil irrespective of a
will, and discoverable in a substance apart from that. Every creature of
God is good, and nothing of His “to be rejected”; all that God made was
“very good <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1414](#fn_1412.md) .” But the habit
of sinning entered as we have described, and with fatal quickness, into
the life of man; and from that small beginning spread into this
infinitude of evil. Then that godly beauty of the soul which was an
imitation of the Archetypal Beauty, like fine steel blackened <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[1415](#fn_1413.md) with the vicious rust, preserved no
longer the glory of its familiar essence, but was disfigured with the
ugliness of sin. This thing so great and precious <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1416](#fn_1414.md) , as the Scripture calls him, this
being man, has fallen from his proud birthright. As those who have
slipped and fallen heavily into mud, and have all their features so
besmeared with it, that their nearest friends do not recognize them, so
this creature has fallen into the mire of sin and lost the blessing of
being an image of the imperishable Deity; he has clothed himself instead
with a perishable and foul resemblance to something else; and this
Reason <span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.xiii-Page_358"></span>counsels him to put away again by
washing it off in the cleansing water of this calling <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1417](#fn_1415.md) . The earthly envelopment once
removed, the soul’s beauty will again appear. Now the putting off of a
strange accretion is equivalent to the return to that which is familiar
and natural; yet such a return cannot be but by again becoming that
which in the beginning we were created. In fact this likeness to the
divine is not our work at all; it is not the achievement of any faculty
of man; it is the great gift of God bestowed upon our nature at the very
moment of our birth; human efforts can only go so far as to clear away
the filth of sin, and so cause the buried beauty of the soul to shine
forth again. This truth is, I think, taught in the Gospel, when our Lord
says, to those who can hear what Wisdom speaks beneath a mystery, that
“the Kingdom of God is within you <span
id="fr_1416"></span>[1418](#fn_1416.md) .” That word <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1419](#fn_1417.md) points out the fact that the Divine
good is not something apart from our nature, and is not removed far away
from those who have the will to seek it; it is in fact within each of
us, ignored indeed, and unnoticed while it is stifled beneath the cares
and pleasures of life, but found again whenever we can turn our power of
conscious thinking towards it. If further confirmation of what we say is
required, I think it will be found in what is suggested by our Lord in
the searching for the Lost Drachma <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[1420](#fn_1418.md) . The thought, there, is that the
widowed soul reaps no benefit from the other virtues (called drachmas in
the Parable) being all of them found safe, if that one other is not
amongst them. The Parable therefore suggests that a candle should first
be lit, signifying doubtless our reason which throws light on hidden
principles; then that in one’s own house, that is, within oneself, we
should search for that lost coin; and by that coin the Parable doubtless
hints at the image of our King, not yet hopelessly lost, but hidden
beneath the dirt; and by this last we must understand the impurities of
the flesh, which, being swept and purged away by carefulness of life,
leave clear to the view the object of our search. Then it is meant that
the soul herself who finds this rejoices over it, and with her the
neighbours, whom she calls in to share with her in this delight. Verily,
all those powers which are the housemates of the soul, and which the
Parable names her neighbours for this occasion <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[1421](#fn_1419.md) , when so be that the image of the
mighty King is revealed in all its brightness at last (that image which
the Fashioner of each individual heart of us has stamped upon this our
Drachma <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1422](#fn_1420) .md), will then be
converted to that divine delight and festivity, and will gaze upon the
ineffable beauty of the recovered one. “Rejoice with me,” she says,
“because I have found the Drachma which I had lost.” The neighbours,
that is, the soul’s familiar powers, both the reasoning and the
appetitive, the affections of grief and of anger, and all the rest that
are discerned in her, at that joyful feast which celebrates the finding
of the heavenly Drachma are well called her friends also; and it is meet
that they should all rejoice in the Lord when they all look towards the
Beautiful and the Good, and do everything for the glory of God, no
longer instruments of sin <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1423](#fn_1421.md) .
If, then, such is the lesson of this Finding of the lost, viz. that we
should restore the divine image from the foulness which the flesh wraps
round it to its primitive state, let us become that which the First Man
was at the moment when he first breathed. And what was that? Destitute
he was then of his covering of dead skins, but he could gaze without
shrinking upon God’s countenance. He did not yet judge of what was
lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone all that was sweet;
and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture
signifies when it said that “he knew her not <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1424](#fn_1422.md) ” till he was driven forth from the
garden, and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing,
was sentenced to the pangs of childbirth. We, then, who in our first
ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return to our earliest state
of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What
are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed
after pleasure shame, and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of
their Creator, so that they hid themselves in leaves and shade; and
after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and
then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as
the compensation for having to die, marriage was instituted <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1425](#fn_1423.md) . Now if we are destined “to depart
hence, and be with Christ <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1426](#fn_1424.md) ,”
we must begin at the end of the route of departure (which lies nearest
to ourselves); just as those who have travelled far from their friends
at home, when they turn to reach again the place from which they
started, first leave that district which they reached at the end of
their outward journey. Marriage, then, is the last stage of our
separation from the life that was led in Paradise; marriage therefore,
as our discourse has been suggesting, is the first thing to be left; it
is the first station as it were for our departure to Christ. Next, we
must retire from all anxious toil upon the land, such as man was <span
id="page_359">p. 359</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.xiii-Page_359"></span>bound to after his sin. Next we must
divest ourselves of those coverings of our nakedness, the coats of
skins, namely the wisdom of the flesh; we must renounce all shameful
things done in secret <span id="fr_1425"></span>[1427](#fn_1425.md) , and
be covered no longer with the fig-leaves of this bitter world; then,
when we have torn off the coatings of this life’s perishable leaves, we
must stand again in the sight of our Creator; and repelling all the
illusion of taste and sight, take for our guide God’s commandment only,
instead of the venom-spitting serpent. That commandment was, to touch
nothing but what was Good, and to leave what was evil untasted; because
impatience to remain any longer in ignorance of evil would be but the
beginning of the long train of actual evil. For this reason it was
forbidden to our first parents to grasp the knowledge of the opposite to
the good, as well as that of the good itself; they were to keep
themselves from “the knowledge of good and evil <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1428](#fn_1426.md) ,” and to enjoy the Good in its
purity, unmixed with one particle of evil: and to enjoy *that,* is in my
judgment nothing else than to be ever with God, and to feel ceaselessly
and continually this delight, unalloyed by aught that could tear us away
from it. One might even be bold to say that this might be found the way
by which a man could be again caught up into Paradise out of this world
which lieth in the Evil, into that Paradise where Paul was when he saw
the unspeakable sights which it is not lawful for a man to talk of <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1429](#fn_1427.md) .
