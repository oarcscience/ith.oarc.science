<span id="viii.i.vii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.i.vii.iii-p1"></span> §3. *A remarkable and original
reply to these utterances, and a demonstration of the power of the
Crucified, and of the fact that this subjection was of the Human Nature,
not that which the Only-Begotten has from the Father. Also an
explanation of the figure of the Cross, and of the appellation “Christ,”
and an account of the good gifts bestowed on the Human Nature by the
Godhead which was commingled with it.*

<span id="viii.i.vii.iii-p2"></span>Well, such is his accusation. But I
think it necessary in the first place to go briefly, by way of summary,
over the points that he urges, and then to proceed to correct by my
argument what he has said, that those who are judging the truth may find
it easy to remember the indictment against us, which we have to answer,
and that we may be able to dispose of each of the charges in regular
order. He says that we are ashamed of the Cross of Christ, and slander
the saints, and say that a man has “emptied himself” to become man, and
suppose that the Lord had the “form of a servant” before His presence by
the Incarnation, and ascribe our redemption to a man, and speak in our
doctrine of two Christs and two Lords, or, if we do not do this, then we
deny that the Only-begotten was Lord and Christ before the Passion. So
that we may avoid this blasphemy, he will have us confess that the
essence of the Son has been made, on the ground that the Apostle Peter
by his own voice establishes such a doctrine. This is the substance of
the accusation; for all that he has been at the trouble of saying by way
of abuse of ourselves, I will pass by in silence, as being not at all to
the point. It may be that this rhetorical stroke of phrases framed
according to some artificial <span id="page_CLXXVI">p. CLXXVI</span>
<span id="viii.i.vii.iii-Page_CLXXVI"></span>theory is the ordinary
habit of those who play the rhetorician, an invention to swell the bulk
of their indictment. Let our sophist then use his art to display his
insolence, and vaunt his strength in reproaches against us, showing off
his strokes in the intervals of the contest; let him call us foolish,
call us of all men most reckless, of all men most miserable, full of
confusion and absurdity, and make light of us at his good pleasure in
any way he likes, and we will bear it; for to a reasonable man disgrace
lies, not in hearing one who abuses him, but in making retort to what he
says. There may even be some good in his expenditure of breath against
us; for it may be that while he occupies his railing tongue in
denouncing us he will at all events make some truce in his conflict
against God. So let him take his fill of insolence as he likes: none
will reply to him. For if a man has foul and loathsome breath, by reason
of bodily disorder, or of some pestilential and malignant disease, he
would not rouse any healthy person to emulate his misfortune so that one
should choose, by himself acquiring disease, to repay, in the same evil
kind, the unpleasantness of the man’s ill odour. Such men our common
nature bids us to pity, not to imitate. And so let us pass by everything
of this kind which by mockery, indignation, provocation, and abuse, he
has assiduously mixed up with his argument, and examine only his
arguments as they concern the doctrinal points at issue. We shall begin
again, then, from the beginning, and meet each of his charges in turn.

<span id="viii.i.vii.iii-p3"></span>The beginning of his accusation was
that we are ashamed of the Cross of Him Who for our sakes underwent the
Passion. Surely he does not intend to charge against us also that we
preach the doctrine of dissimilarity in essence! Why, it is rather to
those who turn aside to this opinion that the reproach belongs of going
about to make the Cross a shameful thing. For if by both parties alike
the dispensation of the Passion is held as part of the faith, while we
hold it necessary to honour, even as the Father is honoured, the God Who
was manifested by the Cross, and *they* find the Passion a hindrance to
glorifying the Only-begotten God equally with the Father that begat Him,
then our sophist’s charges recoil upon himself, and in the words with
which he imagines himself to be accusing us, he is publishing his own
doctrinal impiety. For it is clear that the reason why he sets the
Father above the Son, and exalts Him with supreme honour, is this,—that
in Him is not seen the shame of the Cross: and the reason why he
asseverates that the nature of the Son varies in the sense of
inferiority is this,—that the reproach of the Cross is referred to Him
alone, and does not touch the Father. And let no one think that in
saying this I am only following the general drift of his composition,
for in going through all the blasphemy of his speech, which is there
laboriously brought together, I found, in a passage later than that
before us, this very blasphemy clearly expressed in undisguised
language; and I propose to set forth, in the orderly course of my own
argument, what they have written, which runs thus:—“If,” he says, “he
can show that the God Who is over all, Who is the unapproachable Light,
was incarnate, or could be incarnate, came under authority, obeyed
commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, then let him say
that the Light is equal to the Light.” Who then is it who is ashamed of
the Cross? he who, even after the Passion, worships the Son equally with
the Father, or he who even before the Passion insults Him, not only by
ranking Him with the creation, but by maintaining that He is of passible
nature, on the ground that He could not have come to experience His
sufferings had He not had a nature capable of such sufferings? We on our
part assert that even the body in which He underwent His Passion, by
being mingled with the Divine Nature, was made by that commixture to be
that which the assuming <span id="fr_710"></span>[712](#fn_710.md) Nature
is. So far are we from entertaining any low idea concerning the
Only-begotten God, that if anything belonging to our lowly nature was
assumed in His dispensation of love for man, we believe that even this
was transformed to what is Divine and incorruptible <span
id="fr_711"></span>[713](#fn_711.md) ; but Eunomius makes the suffering of
the Cross to be a sign of divergence in essence, in the sense of
inferiority, considering, I know not how, the surpassing act of power,
by which He was able to perform this, to be an evidence of weakness;
failing to perceive the fact that, while nothing which moves according
to its own nature is looked upon as surprisingly wonderful, all things
that overpass the limitations of their own nature become especially the
objects of admiration, and to them every ear is turned, every mind is
attentive, in wonder at the marvel. And hence it is that all who preach
the word point out the wonderful character of the mystery in this
respect,—that “God was manifested in the flesh <span
id="fr_712"></span>[714](#fn_712.md) ,” that “the Word was made flesh <span
id="fr_713"></span>[715](#fn_713.md) ,” that “the Light shined in
darkness <span id="fr_714"></span>[716](#fn_714.md) ,” “the Life tasted
death,” and all such declarations which the heralds of the faith are
wont to make, whereby is increased the marvellous character <span
id="page_CLXXVII">p. CLXXVII</span> <span
id="viii.i.vii.iii-Page_CLXXVII"></span>of Him Who manifested the
superabundance of His power by means external to his own nature. But
though they think fit to make this a subject for their insolence, though
they make the dispensation of the Cross a reason for partitioning off
the Son from equality of glory with the Father, we believe, as those
“who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the
word <span id="fr_715"></span>[717](#fn_715.md) ” delivered to us by the
Holy Scriptures, that the God who was in the beginning, “afterwards”, as
Baruch says, “was seen upon the earth, and conversed with men <span
id="fr_716"></span>[718](#fn_716.md) ,” and, becoming a ransom for our
death, loosed by His own resurrection the bonds of death, and by Himself
made the resurrection a way for all flesh <span
id="fr_717"></span>[719](#fn_717.md) , and being on the same throne and in
the same glory with His own Father, will in the day of judgment give
sentence upon those who are judged, according to the desert of the lives
they have led. These are the things which we believe concerning Him Who
was crucified, and for this cause we cease not to extol Him exceedingly,
according to the measure of our powers, that He Who by reason of His
unspeakable and unapproachable greatness is not comprehensible by any,
save by Himself and the Father and the Holy Spirit, He, I say, was able
even to descend to community with our weakness. But they adduce this
proof of the Son’s alienation in nature from the Father, that the Lord
was manifested by the flesh and by the Cross, arguing on the ground that
the Father’s nature remained pure in impassibility, and could not in any
way admit of a community which tended to passion, while the Son, by
reason of the divergence of His nature by way of humiliation, was not
incapable of being brought to experience the flesh and death, seeing
that the change of condition was not great, but one which took place in
a certain sense from one like state to another state kindred and
homogeneous, because the nature of man is created, and the nature of the
Only-begotten is created also. Who then is fairly charged with being
ashamed of the Cross? he who speaks basely of it <span
id="fr_718"></span>[720](#fn_718.md) , or he who contends for its more
exalted aspect? I know not whether our accuser, who thus abases the God
Who was made known upon the Cross, has heard the lofty speech of Paul,
in what terms and at what length he discourses with his exalted lips
concerning that Cross. For he, who was able to make himself known by
miracles so many and so great, says, “God forbid that I should glory in
anything else, than in the Cross of Christ <span
id="fr_719"></span>[721](#fn_719.md) .” And to the Corinthians he says that
the word of the Cross is “the power of God to them that are in a state
of salvation <span id="fr_720"></span>[722](#fn_720.md) .” To the
Ephesians, moreover, he describes by the figure of the Cross the power
that controls and holds together the universe, when he expresses a
desire that they may be exalted to know the exceeding glory of this
power, calling it height, and depth, and breadth, and length <span
id="fr_721"></span>[723](#fn_721.md) , speaking of the several projections
we behold in the figure of the Cross by their proper names, so that he
calls the upper part “height,” and that which is below, on the opposite
side of the junction, “depth,” while by the name “length and breadth” he
indicates the cross-beam projecting to either side, that hereby might be
manifested this great mystery, that both things in heaven, and things
under the earth, and all the furthest bounds of the things that are, are
ruled and sustained by Him Who gave an example of this unspeakable and
mighty power in the figure of the Cross. But I think there is no need to
contend further with such objections, as I judge it superfluous to be
anxious about urging arguments against calumny when even a few words
suffice to show the truth. Let us therefore pass on to another charge.

<span id="viii.i.vii.iii-p16"></span>He says that by us the saints are
slandered. Well, if he has heard it himself, let him tell us the words
of our defamation: if he thinks we have uttered it to others, let him
show the truth of his charge by witnesses: if he demonstrates it from
what we have written, let him read the words, and we will bear the
blame. But he cannot bring forward anything of the kind: our writings
are open for examination to any one who desires it. If it was not said
to himself, and he has not heard it from others, and has no proof to
offer from our writings, I think he who has to make answer on this point
may well hold his peace: silence is surely the fitting answer to an
unfounded charge.

<span id="viii.i.vii.iii-p17"></span>The Apostle Peter says, “God made
this Jesus, Whom ye crucified, Lord and Christ <span
id="fr_722"></span>[724](#fn_722.md) .” We, learning this from him, say
that the whole context of the passage tends one way,—the Cross itself,
the human name, the indicative turn of the phrase. For the word of the
Scripture says that in regard to one person two things were wrought,—by
the Jews, the Passion, and by God, honour; not as though one person had
suffered and another had been honoured by exaltation: and he further
explains this yet more clearly by his words in what follows, “being
exalted by the right hand of God.” Who then was “exalted”? He that was
lowly, or He that was the Highest? and what else is the lowly, but the
Humanity? what else is the Highest, but the Divinity? Surely, God needs
not to be exalted, seeing that He is the Highest. It follows, then, that
the Apostle’s meaning is <span id="page_CLXXVIII">p. CLXXVIII</span>
<span id="viii.i.vii.iii-Page_CLXXVIII"></span>that the Humanity was
exalted: and its exaltation was effected by its becoming Lord and
Christ. And this took place after the Passion. <span
id="fr_723"></span>[725](#fn_723.md) It is not therefore the pre-temporal
existence of the Lord which the Apostle indicates by the word “made,”
but that change of the lowly to the lofty which was effected “by the
right hand of God.” Even by this phrase is declared the mystery of
godliness; for he who says “exalted by the right hand of God” manifestly
reveals the unspeakable dispensation of this mystery, that the Right
Hand of God, that made all things that are, (which is the Lord, by Whom
all things were made, and without Whom nothing that is subsists,) Itself
raised to Its own height the Man united with It, making Him also to be
what It is by nature. Now It is Lord and King: Christ is the King’s
name: these things It made Him too. For as He was highly exalted by
being in the Highest, so too He became all else,—Immortal in the
Immortal, Light in the Light, Incorruptible in the Incorruptible,
Invisible in the Invisible, Christ in the Christ, Lord in the Lord. For
even in physical combinations. when one of the combined parts exceeds
the other in a great degree, the inferior is wont to change completely
to that which is more potent. And this we are plainly taught by the
voice of the Apostle Peter in his mystic discourse, that the lowly
nature of Him Who was crucified through weakness, (and weakness, as we
have heard from the Lord, marks the flesh <span
id="fr_724"></span>[726](#fn_724) ,.md) that lowly nature, I say, by virtue
of its combination with the infinite and boundless element of good,
remained no longer in its own measures and properties, but was by the
Right Hand of God raised up together with Itself, and became Lord
instead of servant, Christ a King instead of a subject, Highest instead
of Lowly, God instead of man. What handle then against the saints did he
who pretends to give warning against us in defence of the Apostles find
in the material of our writings? Let us pass over this charge also in
silence; for I think it a mean and unworthy thing to stand up against
charges that are false and unfounded. Let us pass on to the more
pressing part of his accusation.

years of His life on earth, our Lord’s Humanity was not so united with
His Divinity that “the visible man” was then both Lord and Christ. He
probably refers more especially to the manifestation of His Messiahship
afforded by the Resurrection and Ascension; but he also undoubtedly
dwells on the exaltation of the Human Nature after the Passion in terms
which would perhaps imply more than he intended to convey. His language
on this point may be compared with the more guarded and careful
statement of Hooker. (Eccl. Pol. V. lv. 8.) The point of his argument is
that S. Peter’s words apply to the Human Nature, not to the Divine.
