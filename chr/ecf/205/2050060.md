<span id="viii.i.iv.i-p1"></span> <span id="page_CI">p. CI</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.i-Page_CI"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.i.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Book II.</span>

<span id="viii.i.iv.i-p2"></span>§1. *The second book declares the
Incarnation of God the Word, and the faith delivered by the Lord to His
disciples, and asserts that the heretics who endeavour to overthrow this
faith and devise other additional names are of their father the devil.*

<span id="viii.i.iv.i-p3"></span>The Christian Faith, which in
accordance with the command of our Lord has been preached to all nations
by His disciples, is neither of men, nor by men, but by our Lord Jesus
Christ Himself, Who being the Word, the Life, the Light, the Truth, and
God, and Wisdom, and all else that He is by nature, for this cause above
all was made in the likeness of man, and shared our nature, becoming
like us in all things, yet without sin. He was like us in all things, in
that He took upon Him manhood in its entirety with soul and body, so
that our salvation was accomplished by means of both:—He, I say,
appeared on earth and “conversed with men <span
id="fr_240"></span>[242](#fn_240.md) ,” that men might no longer have
opinions according to their own notions about the Self-existent,
formulating into a doctrine the hints that come to them from vague
conjectures, but that we might be convinced that God has truly been
manifested in the flesh, and believe that to be the only true “mystery
of godliness <span id="fr_241"></span>[243](#fn_241.md) ,” which was
delivered to us by the very Word and God, Who by Himself spake to His
Apostles, and that we might receive the teaching concerning the
transcendent nature of the Deity which is given to us, as it were,
“through a glass darkly <span id="fr_242"></span>[244](#fn_242.md) ” from
the older Scriptures,—from the Law, and the Prophets, and the Sapiential
Books, as an evidence of the truth fully revealed to us, reverently
accepting the meaning of the things which have been spoken, so as to
accord in the faith set forth by the Lord of the whole Scriptures <span
id="fr_243"></span>[245](#fn_243.md) , which faith we guard as we received
it, word for word, in purity, without falsification, judging even a
slight divergence from the words delivered to us an extreme blasphemy
and impiety. We believe, then, even as the Lord set forth the Faith to
His Disciples, when He said, “Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost <span
id="fr_244"></span>[246](#fn_244.md) .” This is the word of the mystery
whereby through the new birth from above our nature is transformed from
the corruptible to the incorruptible, being renewed from “the old man,”
“according to the image of Him who created <span
id="fr_245"></span>[247](#fn_245.md) ” at the beginning the likeness to the
Godhead. In the Faith then which was delivered by God to the Apostles we
admit neither subtraction, nor alteration, nor addition, knowing
assuredly that he who presumes to pervert the Divine utterance by
dishonest quibbling, the same “is of his father the devil,” who leaves
the words of truth and “speaks of his own,” becoming the father of a
lie <span id="fr_246"></span>[248](#fn_246.md) . For whatsoever is said
otherwise than in exact accord with the truth is assuredly false and not
true.
