<span id="xi.ii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xii-p2"></span>“<span class="c22"><span
id="xi.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>But</span> the nature of man,” it is said,
“is narrow and circumscribed, whereas the Deity is infinite. How could
the infinite be included in the atom <span
id="fr_1969"></span>[1971](#fn_1969.md) ?” But who is it that says the
infinitude of the Deity is comprehended in the envelopment of the flesh
as if it were in a vessel? Not even in the case of our own life is the
intellectual nature shut up within the boundary of the flesh. On the
contrary, while the body’s bulk is limited to the proportions peculiar
to it, the soul by the movements of its thinking faculty can
coincide <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1972](#fn_1970.md) at will with the
whole of creation. It ascends to the heavens, and sets foot within the
deep. It traverses the breadth of the world, and in the restlessness of
its curiosity makes its way into the regions that are beneath the earth;
and often it is occupied in the scrutiny of the wonders of heaven, and
feels no weight from the appendage <span
id="fr_1971"></span>[1973](#fn_1971.md) of the body. If, then, the soul of
man, although by the necessity of its nature it is transfused through
the body, yet presents itself everywhere at will, what necessity is
there for saying that the Deity is hampered by an environment of fleshly
nature, and why may we not, by examples which we are capable of
understanding, gain some reasonable idea of God’s plan of salvation?
There is an analogy, for instance, in the flame of a lamp, which is seen
to embrace the material with which it is supplied <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1974](#fn_1972.md) . Reason makes a distinction
between the flame upon the material, and the material that kindles the
flame, though in fact it is not possible to cut off the one from the
other so as to exhibit the flame separate from the material, but they
both united form one single thing. But let no one, I beg, associate also
with this illustration the idea of the perishableness of the flame; let
him accept only what is apposite in the <span id="page_486">p.
486</span> <span id="xi.ii.xii-Page_486"></span>image; what is
irrelevant and incongruous let him reject. What is there, then, to
prevent our thinking (just as we see flame fastening on the
material <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1975](#fn_1973.md) , and yet not
inclosed in it) of a kind of union or approximation of the Divine nature
with humanity, and yet in this very approximation guarding the proper
notion of Deity, believing as we do that, though the Godhead be in man,
it is beyond all circumscription?

<span id="xi.ii.xii-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xii-p3.1"></span>τῷ ἀτόμῳ</span>: here, the individual body of
man: “individuo corpusculo,” Zinus translates. Theodoret in his second
(“Unconfused”) Dialogue quotes this very passage about the “infiniteness
of the Deity,” and a “vessel,” to prove the *two* natures of Christ.

<span id="xi.ii.xii-p6"></span> There is a touch of Eutychianism in this
illustration of the union of the Two Natures; as also in Gregory’s
answer (c. *Eunom.* iii. 265; v. 589) to Eunomius’ charge of Two Persons
against the Nicene party, viz. that “the flesh with all its peculiar
marks and properties is taken up and transformed into the Divine
nature”; whence arose that <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xii-p6.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xii-p6.2"></span>ντιμεθίστασις τῶν ὀνομάτων</span>, i.e.
*reciprocal* interchange of the properties human and Divine, which
afterwards occasioned the Monophysite controversy. But Origen had used
language still more incautious; “with regard to his mortal body and his
human soul, we believe that owing to something more than communion with
Him, to actual union and intermingling, it has acquired the highest
qualities, and partakes of His Divinity, and so has changed into God”
(*c. Cels.* iii. 41).

<span id="xi.ii.xii-p7"></span> *fastening on the material.* The word
(<span class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xii-p7.1"></span>ἅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xii-p7.2"></span>πτεσθαι</span>) could
mean either “fastening on,” or “depending on,” or “kindled from” (it has
been used in this last sense just above). Krabinger selects the second,
“quæ a subjecto dependet.”
