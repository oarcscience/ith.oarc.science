<span id="x.ii.ii.vii-p1"></span> VI. *An examination of the kindred of
mind to nature: wherein, by way of digression, is refuted the doctrine
of the Anomœans* <span id="fr_1603"></span>[1605](#fn_1603) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.vii-p3"></span>1. And let no one suppose me to say
that the Deity is in touch with existing things in a manner resembling
human operation, by means of different faculties. For it is impossible
to conceive in the simplicity of the Godhead the varied and diverse
nature of the apprehensive operation: not even in our own case are the
faculties which apprehend things numerous, although we are in touch with
those things which affect our life in many ways by means of our senses;
for there is one faculty, the implanted mind itself, which passes
through each of the organs of sense and grasps the things beyond: this
it is that, by means of the eyes, beholds what is seen; this it is that,
by means of hearing, understands what is said; that is content with what
is to our taste, and turns from what is unpleasant; that uses the hand
for whatever it wills, taking hold or rejecting <span id="page_392">p.
392</span> <span id="x.ii.ii.vii-Page_392"></span>by its means, using
the help of the organ for this purpose precisely as it thinks expedient.

<span id="x.ii.ii.vii-p4"></span>2. If in men, then, even though the
organs formed by nature for purposes of perception may be different,
that which operates and moves by means of all, and uses each
appropriately for the object before it, is one and the same, not
changing its nature by the differences of operations, how could any one
suspect multiplicity of essence in God on the ground of His varied
powers? for “He that made the eye,” as the prophet says, and “that
planted the ear <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1606](#fn_1604) ,” stamped on
human nature these operations to be as it were significant characters,
with reference to their models in Himself: for He says, “Let us make man
in our image <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1607](#fn_1605) .”

<span id="x.ii.ii.vii-p7"></span>3. But what, I would ask, becomes of
the heresy of the Anomœans? what will they say to this utterance? how
will they defend the vanity of their dogma in view of the words cited?
Will they say that it is possible that one image should be made like to
different forms? if the Son is in nature unlike the Father, how comes it
that the likeness He forms of the different natures is one? for He Who
said, “Let us make after our image,” and by the plural signification
revealed the Holy Trinity, would not, if the archetypes were unlike one
another, have mentioned the image in the singular: for it would be
impossible that there should be one likeness displayed of things which
do not agree with one another: if the natures were different he would
assuredly have begun their images also differently, making the
appropriate image for each: but since the image is one, while the
archetype is not one, who is so far beyond the range of understanding as
not to know that the things which are like the same thing, surely
resemble one another? Therefore He says (the word, it may be, cutting
short this wickedness at the very formation of human life), “Let us make
man in our image, after our likeness.”
