<span id="x.ii.ii.xviii"></span>

<span id="x.ii.ii.xviii-p1"></span> XVII. *What we must answer to those
who raise the question—“If procreation is after sin, how would souls
have come into being if the first of mankind had remained sinless* <span
id="fr_1659"></span>[1661](#fn_1659.md) *?”*

<span id="x.ii.ii.xviii-p3"></span>1. It is better for us however,
perhaps, rather to inquire, before investigating this point, the
solution of the question put forward by our adversaries; for they say
that before the sin there is no account of birth, or of travail, or of
the desire that tends to procreation, but when they were banished from
Paradise after their sin, and the woman was condemned by the sentence of
travail, Adam thus entered with his consort upon the intercourse of
married life, and then took place the beginning of procreation. If,
then, marriage did not exist in Paradise, nor travail, nor birth, they
say that it follows as a necessary conclusion that human souls would not
have existed in plurality had not the grace of immortality fallen away
to mortality, and marriage preserved our race by means of descendants,
introducing the offspring of the departing to take their place, so that
in a certain way the sin that entered into the world was profitable for
the life of man: for the human <span id="page_407">p. 407</span> <span
id="x.ii.ii.xviii-Page_407"></span>race would have remained in the pair
of the first-formed, had not the fear of death impelled their nature to
provide succession.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xviii-p4"></span>2. Now here again the true answer,
whatever it may be, can be clear to those only who, like Paul, have been
instructed in the mysteries of Paradise; but our answer is as follows.
When the Sadducees once argued against the doctrine of the resurrection,
and brought forward, to establish their own opinion, that woman of many
marriages, who had been wife to seven brethren, and thereupon inquired
whose wife she will be after the resurrection, our Lord answered their
argument so as not only to instruct the Sadducees, but also to reveal to
all that come after them the mystery of the resurrection-life: “for in
the resurrection,” He says, “they neither marry, nor are given in
marriage; neither can they die any more, for they are equal to the
angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the
resurrection <span id="fr_1660"></span>[1662](#fn_1660.md) .” Now the
resurrection promises us nothing else than the restoration of the fallen
to their ancient state; for the grace we look for is a certain return to
the first life, bringing back again to Paradise him who was cast out
from it. If then the life of those restored is closely related to that
of the angels, it is clear that the life before the transgression was a
kind of angelic life, and hence also our return to the ancient condition
of our life is compared to the angels. Yet while, as has been said,
there is no marriage among them, the armies of the angels are in
countless myriads; for so Daniel declared in his visions: so, in the
same way, if there had not come upon us as the result of sin a change
for the worse, and removal from equality with the angels, neither should
we have needed marriage that we might multiply; but whatever the mode of
increase in the angelic nature is (unspeakable and inconceivable by
human conjectures, except that it assuredly exists), it would have
operated also in the case of men, who were “made a little lower than the
angels <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1663](#fn_1661.md) ,” to increase mankind
to the measure determined by its Maker.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xviii-p7"></span>3. But if any one finds a difficulty
in an inquiry as to the manner of the generation of souls, had man not
needed the assistance of marriage, we shall ask him in turn, what is the
mode of the angelic existence, how they exist in countless myriads,
being one essence, and at the same time numerically many; for we shall
be giving a fit answer to one who raises the question how man would have
been without marriage, if we say, “as the angels are without marriage;”
for the fact that man was in a like condition with them before the
transgression is shown by the restoration to that state.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xviii-p8"></span>4. Now that we have thus cleared up
these matters, let us return to our former point,—how it was that after
the making of His image God contrived for His work the distinction of
male and female. I say that the preliminary speculation we have
completed is of service for determining this question; for He Who
brought all things into being and fashioned Man as a whole by His own
will to the Divine image, did not wait to see the number of souls made
up to its proper fulness by the gradual additions of those coming after;
but while looking upon the nature of man in its entirety and fulness by
the exercise of His foreknowledge, and bestowing upon it a lot exalted
and equal to the angels, since He saw beforehand by His all-seeing power
the failure of their will to keep a direct course to what is good, and
its consequent declension from the angelic life, in order that the
multitude of human souls might not be cut short by its fall from that
mode by which the angels were increased and multiplied,—for this reason,
I say, He formed for our nature that contrivance for increase which
befits those who had fallen into sin, implanting in mankind, instead of
the angelic majesty of nature, that animal and irrational mode by which
they now succeed one another.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xviii-p9"></span>5. Hence also, it seems to me, the
great David pitying the misery of man mourns over his nature with such
words as these, that, “man being in honour knew it not” (meaning by
“honour” the equality with the angels), therefore, he says, “he is
compared to the beasts that have no understanding, and made like unto
them <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1664](#fn_1662.md) .” For he truly was made
like the beasts, who received in his nature the present mode of
transient generation, on account of his inclination to material things.
