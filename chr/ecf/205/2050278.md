<span id="xiii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Letter XII <span
id="fr_2199"></span>[2201](#fn_2199.md) </span>.—*On his work against
Eunomius*.

<span id="xiii.xiii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.xiii-p3.1"></span>We</span> Cappadocians are poor in well-nigh
all things that make the possessors of them happy, but above all we are
badly off for people who are able to write. This, be sure, is the reason
why I am so slow about sending you a letter: for, though my reply to the
heresy (of Eunomius) had been long ago completed, there was no one to
transcribe it. Such a dearth of writers it was that brought upon us the
suspicion of sluggishness or of inability to frame an answer. But since
now at any rate, thank God, the writer and reviser have come, I have
sent this treatise to you; not, as Isocrates says <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2202](#fn_2200.md) , as a present, for I do not reckon
it to be such that it should be received in lieu of something of
substantial value, but that it may be in our power to cheer on those who
are in the full vigour of youth to do battle with the enemy, by stirring
up the naturally sanguine temperament of early life. But if any portion
of the treatise should appear worthy of serious consideration, after
examining some parts, especially those prefatory to the “trials,” <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2203](#fn_2201.md) and those which are of the same
cast, and perhaps also some <span id="page_535">p. 535</span> <span
id="xiii.xiii-Page_535"></span>of the doctrinal parts of the book, you
will think them not ungratefully composed. But to whatever conclusion
you come, you will of course read them, as to a teacher and corrector,
to those who do not act like the players at ball <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2204](#fn_2202.md) , when they stand in three
different places and throw it from one to the other, aiming it exactly
and catching one ball from one and one from another, and they baffle the
player who is in the middle, as he jumps up to catch it, pretending that
they are going to throw with a made-up expression of face, and such and
such a motion of the hand to left or right, and whichever way they see
him hurrying, they send the ball just the contrary way, and cheat his
expectation by a trick. This holds even now in the case of most of us,
who, dropping all serious purpose, play at being good-natured <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2205](#fn_2203.md) , as if at ball, with men, instead
of realizing the favourable hope which we hold out, beguiling to
sinister <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2206](#fn_2204.md) issues the souls of
those who repose confidence in us. Letters of reconciliation, caresses,
tokens, presents, affectionate embrace by letters—these are the making
as if to throw with the ball to the right. But instead of the pleasure
which one expects therefrom, one gets accusations, plots, slanders,
disparagement, charges brought against one, bits of a sentence torn from
their context, caught up, and turned to one’s hurt. Blessed in your
hopes are ye, who through all such trials exercise confidence towards
God. But we beseech you not to look at our words, but to the teaching of
our Lord in the Gospel. For what consolation to one in anguish can
another be, who surpasses him in the extremity of his own anguish, to
help his luckless fortunes to obtain their proper issue? As He saith,
“Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.” But do you, best of
men, go on in a manner worthy of yourself, and trust in God, and do not
be hindered by the spectacle of our misfortunes from being good and
true, but commit to God that judgeth righteously the suitable and just
issue of events, and act as Divine wisdom guides you. Assuredly Joseph
had in the result no reason to grieve at the envy of his brethren,
inasmuch as the malice of his own kith and kin became to him the road to
empire.

<span id="xiii.xiii-p2"></span> The Cod. Medic. has “to John and
Maximinian.” In this letter but one person seems to be addressed.
Gregory here speaks, without doubt, of his books against Eunomius: not
of his *Antirrhetic against Apollinaris,* which could have been
transcribed in a very short time. Therefore we can place the date about
383, some months after Gregory’s twelve Books against Eunomius,
according to Hermantius, were published.

<span id="xiii.xiii-p8"></span> It is difficult to reproduce the play
upon words in <span class="Greek"><span

id="xiii.xiii-p8.2"></span>σκαιότητι</span>, which refer to the <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiii.xiii-p8.3"></span>κατὰ τὸ δέξιον ἢ
εὐωνύμον</span> in the description of the game of ball: the words having
both a local meaning, “right,” and “left,” and a metaphorical one,
“favourable,” and “sinister” (H. C. O.).
