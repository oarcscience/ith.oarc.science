<span id="xi.ii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>If</span> a person requires proofs of God’s
having been manifested to us in the flesh, let him look at the Divine
activities. For of the existence of the Deity at all one can discover no
other demonstration than that which the testimony of those activities
supplies. When, that is, we take a wide survey of the universe, and
consider the dispensations throughout the world, and the Divine
benevolences that operate in our life, we grasp the conception of a
power overlying all, that is creative of all things that come into
being, and is conservative of them as they exist. On the same principle,
as regards the manifestation of God in the flesh, we have established a
satisfactory proof of that apparition of Deity, in those wonders of His
operations; for in all his work as actually recorded we recognize the
characteristics of the Divine nature. It belongs to God to give life to
men, to uphold by His providence all things that exist. It belongs to
God to bestow meat and drink on those who in the flesh have received
from Him the boon of life, to benefit the needy, to bring back to
itself, by means of renewed health, the nature that has been perverted
by sickness. It belongs to God to rule with equal sway the whole of
creation; earth, sea, air, and the realms above the air. It is His to
have a power that is sufficient for all things, and above all to be
stronger than death and corruption. Now if in any one of these or the
like particulars the record of Him had been wanting, they who are
external to the faith had reasonably taken exception <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[1977](#fn_1975.md) to the gospel revelation. But if
every notion that is conceivable of God is to be traced in what is
recorded of Him, what is there to hinder our faith?
