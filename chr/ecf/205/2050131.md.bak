<span id="viii.i.xiii.v-p1"></span> §5.  <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1006](#fn_1004.md) *Eunomius again speaks of the Son
as Lord and God, and Maker of all creation intelligible and sensible,
having received from the Father the power and the commission for
creation, being entrusted with the task of creation as if He were an
artizan commissioned by some one hiring Him, and receiving His power of
creation as a thing adventitious, ab extra, as a result of the power
allotted to Him in accordance with such and such combinations and
positions of the stars, as destiny decrees their lot in life to men at
their nativity. Thus, passing by most of what Eunomius had written, he
confutes his blasphemy that the Maker of all things came into being in
like manner with the earth and with angels, and that the subsistence of
the Only-begotten differs not at all from the genesis of all things, and
reproaches Him with reverencing neither the Divine mystery nor the
custom of the Church, nor following in his attempt to discover godliness
any teacher of pious doctrine, but Manichæus, Colluthus, Arius, Aetius,
and those like to them, supposing that Christianity in general is folly,
and that the* <span id="page_CCXXXVII">p. CCXXXVII</span> <span
id="viii.i.xiii.v-Page_CCXXXVII"></span>*customs of the Church and the
venerable sacraments are a jest, wherein he differs in nothing from the
pagans, who borrowed from our doctrine the idea of a great God supreme
over all. So, too, this new idolater preaches in the same fashion, and
in particular that baptism is “into an artificer and creator,” not
fearing the curse of those who cause addition or diminution to the Holy
Scriptures. And he closes his book with showing him to be Antichrist.*

<span id="viii.i.xiii.v-p3"></span>Afterwards, however, he gives his
discourse a more moderate turn, imparting to it even a touch of
gentleness, and, though he had but a little earlier partitioned off the
Son from the title of Existent, he now says,—“We affirm that the Son is
not only existent, and above all existent things, but we also call Him
Lord and God, the Maker of every being <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1007](#fn_1005.md) , sensible and intelligible.” What
does he suppose this “being” to be? created? or uncreated? For if he
confesses Jesus to be Lord, God, and Maker of all intelligible being, it
necessarily follows, if he says it is *uncreated*, that he speaks
falsely, ascribing to the Son the making of the uncreated Nature. But if
he believes it to be *created*, he makes Him His own Maker. For if the
act of creation be not separated from intelligible nature in favour of
Him Who is independent and uncreated, there will no longer remain any
mark of distinction, as the sensible creation and the intelligible being
will be thought of under one head <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1008](#fn_1006.md) . But here he brings in the
assertion that “in the creation of existent things He has been entrusted
by the Father with the construction of all things visible and invisible,
and with the providential care over all that comes into being, inasmuch
as the power allotted to Him from above is sufficient for the production
of those things which have been constructed <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1009](#fn_1007.md) .” The vast length to which our
treatise has run compels us to pass over these assertions briefly: but,
in a sense, profanity surrounds the argument, containing a vast swarm of
notions like venomous wasps. “He was entrusted,” he says, “with the
construction of things by the Father.” But if he had been talking about
some artizan executing his work at the pleasure of his employer, would
he not have used the same language? For we are not wrong in saying just
the same of Bezaleel, that being entrusted by Moses with the building of
the tabernacle, he became the constructor of those things there <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1010](#fn_1008.md) mentioned, and would not have taken
the work in hand had he not previously acquired his knowledge by Divine
inspiration, and ventured upon the undertaking on Moses’ entrusting him
with its execution. Accordingly the term “entrusted” suggests that His
office and power in creation came to Him as something adventitious, in
the sense that before He was entrusted with that commission He had
neither the will nor the power to act, but when He received authority to
execute the works, and power sufficient for the works, *then* He became
the artificer of things that are, the power allotted to Him from on high
being, as Eunomius says, sufficient for the purpose. Does he then place
even the generation of the Son, by some astrological juggling <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1011](#fn_1009.md) , under some destiny, just as they
who practise this vain deceit affirm that the appointment of their lot
in life comes to men at the time of their birth, by such and such
conjunctions or oppositions of the stars, as the rotation above moves on
in a kind of ordered train, assigning to those who are coming into being
their special faculties? It may be that something of this kind is in the
mind of our sage, and he says that to Him that is above all rule, and
authority, and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in
this world, but also in that which is to come, there has been allotted,
as though He were pent in some hollow spaces, power from on high,
measured out in accordance with the quantity of things which come into
being. I will pass over this part of his treatise also summarily,
letting fall from a slight commencement of investigation, for the more
intelligent sort of readers, seeds to enable them to discern his
profanity. Moreover, in what follows, there is ready written a kind of
apology for ourselves. For we cannot any longer be thought to be missing
the intention of his discourse, and misinterpreting his words to render
them subject to criticism, when his own voice acknowledges the absurdity
of his doctrine. His words stand as follows:—“What? did not earth and
angel come into being, when before they were not?” See how our lofty
theologian is not ashamed to apply the same description to earth and
angels and to the Maker of all! Surely if he thinks it fit to predicate
the same of earth and its Lord, he must either make a god of the one, or
degrade the other to a level with it.

<span id="viii.i.xiii.v-p9"></span>Then he adds to this something by
which his profanity is yet more completely stripped of all disguise, so
that its absurdity is obvious even <span id="page_CCXXXVIII">p.
CCXXXVIII</span> <span id="viii.i.xiii.v-Page_CCXXXVIII"></span>to a
child. For he says,—“It would be a long task to detail all the modes of
generation of intelligible objects, or the essences which do not all
possess the nature of the Existent in common, but display variations
according to the operations of Him Who constructed them.” Without any
words of ours, the blasphemy against the Son which is here contained is
glaring and conspicuous, when he acknowledges that that which is
predicated of every mode of generation and essence in nowise differs
from the description of the Divine subsistence <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1012](#fn_1010.md) of the Only-begotten. But it seems
to me best to pass over the intermediate passages in which he seeks to
maintain his profanity, and to hasten to the head and front of the
accusation which we have to bring against his doctrines. For he will be
found to exhibit the sacrament of regeneration as an idle thing, the
mystic oblation as profitless, and the participation in them as of no
advantage to those who are partakers therein. For after those
high-wrought æons <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1013](#fn_1011.md) in which,
by way of disparagement of our doctrine, he names as its supporters a
Valentinus, a Cerinthus, a Basilides, a Montanus, and a Marcion, and
after laying it down that those who affirm that the Divine nature is
unknowable, and the mode of His generation unknowable, have no right or
title whatever to the name of Christians, and after reckoning us among
those whom he thus disparages, he proceeds to develop his own view in
these terms:—“But we, in agreement with holy and blessed men; affirm
that the mystery of godliness does not consist in venerable names, nor
in the distinctive character of customs and sacramental tokens, but in
exactness of doctrine.” That when he wrote this, he did so not under the
guidance of evangelists, apostles, or any of the authors of the Old
Testament, is plain to every one who has any acquaintance with the
sacred and Divine Scripture. We should naturally be led to suppose that
by “holy and blessed men” he meant Manichæus, Nicolaus, Colluthus,
Aetius, Arius, and the rest of the same band, with whom he is in strict
accord in laying down this principle, that neither the confession of
sacred names, nor the customs of the Church, nor her sacramental tokens,
are a ratification of godliness. But we, having learnt from the holy
voice of Christ that “except a man be born again of water and of the
Spirit he shall not enter into the kingdom of God <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1014](#fn_1012.md) ” and that “He that eateth My flesh
and drinketh My blood, shall live for ever <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1015](#fn_1013.md) ,” are persuaded that the mystery
of godliness is ratified by the confession of the Divine Names—the Names
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and that our salvation is
confirmed by participation in the sacramental customs and tokens. But
doctrines have often been carefully investigated by those who have had
no part or lot in that mystery, and one may hear many such putting
forward the faith we hold as a subject for themselves in the rivalry of
debate, and some of them often even succeeding in hitting the truth, and
for all that none the less estranged from the faith. Since, then, he
despises the revered Names, by which the power of the more Divine birth
distributes grace to them who come for it in faith, and slights the
fellowship of the sacramental customs and tokens from which the
Christian profession draws its vigour, let us, with a slight variation,
utter to those who listen to his deceit the word of the prophet:—“How
long will ye be slow of heart? Why do ye love destruction and seek after
leasing <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1016](#fn_1014.md) ?” How is it that ye
do not see the persecutor of the faith inviting those who consent unto
him to violate their Christian profession? For if the confession of the
revered and precious Names of the Holy Trinity is useless, and the
customs of the Church unprofitable, and if among these customs is the
sign of the cross <span id="fr_1015"></span>[1017](#fn_1015.md) , prayer,
baptism, confession of sins, a ready zeal to keep the commandment, right
ordering of character, sobriety of life, regard to justice, the effort
not to be excited by passion, or enslaved by pleasure, or to fall short
in moral excellence,—if he says that none of such habits as these is
cultivated to any good purpose, and that the sacramental tokens do not,
as we have believed, secure spiritual blessings, and avert from
believers the assaults directed against them by the wiles of the evil
one, what else does he do but openly proclaim aloud to men that he deems
the mystery which Christians cherish a fable, laughs at the majesty of
the Divine Names, considers the customs of the Church a jest, and all
sacramental operations idle prattle and folly? What beyond this do they
who remain attached to paganism bring forward in disparagement of our
creed? Do not they too make the majesty of the sacred Names, in which
the faith is ratified, an occasion of laughter? Do not they deride the
sacramental tokens and the customs which are observed by the initiated?
And of whom is it so much a distinguishing peculiarity as of the pagans,
to think that piety should consist in doctrines only? since they also
say that according to their view, there is something more persuasive
than the Gospel which we preach, and <span id="page_CCXXXIX">p.
CCXXXIX</span> <span id="viii.i.xiii.v-Page_CCXXXIX"></span>some of them
hold that there is some one great God preeminent above the rest, and
acknowledge some subject powers, differing among themselves in the way
of superiority or inferiority, in some regular order and sequence, but
all alike subject to the Supreme. This, then, is what the teachers of
the new idolatry preach, and they who follow them have no dread of the
condemnation that abideth on transgressors, as though they did not
understand that actually to do some improper thing is far more grievous
than to err in word alone. They, then, who in act deny the faith, and
slight the confession of the sacred Names, and judge the sanctification
effected by the sacramental tokens to be worthless, and have been
persuaded to have regard to cunningly devised fables, and to fancy that
their salvation consists in quibbles about the generate and the
ungenerate,—what else are they than transgressors of the doctrines of
salvation?

<span id="viii.i.xiii.v-p16"></span>But if any one thinks that these
charges are brought against them by us ungenerously and unfairly, let
him consider independently our author’s writings, both what we have
previously alleged, and what is inferred in logical connection with our
citations. For in direct contravention of the law of the Lord—(for the
deliverance to us of the means of initiation constitutes a law),—he says
that baptism is not into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as
Christ commanded His disciples when He delivered to them the mystery,
but into an artificer and creator, and “not only Father,” he says, “of
the Only-begotten, but also His God <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[1018](#fn_1016.md) .” Woe unto him who gives his
neighbour to drink turbid mischief <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[1019](#fn_1017.md) ! How does he trouble and befoul
the truth by flinging his mud into it! How is it that he feels no fear
of the curse that rests upon those who add aught to the Divine
utterance, or dare to take aught away? Let us read the declaration of
the Lord in His very words—“Go,” He says, “teach all nations, baptizing
them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”
Where did He call the Son a creature? Where did the Word teach that the
Father is creator and artificer of the Only-begotten? Where in the words
cited is it taught that the Son is a servant of God? Where in the
delivery of the mystery is the God of the Son proclaimed? Do ye not
perceive and understand, ye who are dragged by guile to perdition, what
sort of guide ye have put in charge of your souls,—one who interpolates
the Holy Scriptures, who garbles the Divine utterances, who with his own
mud befouls the purity of the doctrines of godliness, who not only arms
his own tongue against us, but also attempts to tamper with the sacred
voices of truth, who is eager to invest his own perversion with more
authority than the teaching of the Lord? Do ye not perceive that he
stirs himself up against the Name at which all must bow, so that in time
the Name of the Lord shall be heard no more, and instead of Christ
Eunomius shall be brought into the Churches? Do ye not yet consider that
this preaching of godlessness has been set on foot by the devil as a
rehearsal, preparation, and prelude of the coming of Antichrist? For he
who is ambitious of showing that his own words are more authoritative
than those of Christ, and of transforming the faith from the Divine
Names and the sacramental customs and tokens to his own deceit,—what
else, I say, could he properly be called, but only Antichrist?

id="viii.i.xiii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i.xiii.v-p2"></span> The grammar of this section of the
analysis is in parts very much confused; the general drift of its
intention, rather than its literal meaning, is given in the translation.
Grammatically speaking it appears to attribute to S. Gregory some of the
opinions of Eunomius. The construction, however, is so ungrammatical
that the confusion is probably in the composer’s expression rather than
in his interpretation of what he is summarizing.

<span id="viii.i.xiii.v-p5"></span> The passage is a little obscure: if
the force of the dative <span class="Greek"><span

assigned to it, the meaning will be that, if no exception is made in the
statement that the Son is the Maker of every intelligible being, the
Deity will be included among the works of the Son, Who will thus be the
Maker of Himself, as of the sensible creation.

If <span class="Greek"><span

renders it by “determinationem.” It may be connected with the name
“Peratae,” given to one of the Ophite sects, who held fatalist views.
