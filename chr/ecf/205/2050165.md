<span id="ix.ii.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> the ways in our life which turn
aside towards sin are innumerable; and their number is told by Scripture
in divers manners. “Many are they that trouble me and persecute,” and
“Many are they that fight against me from on high <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1446](#fn_1444) ”; and many other texts like that.
We may affirm, indeed, absolutely, that many are they who plot in the
adulterer’s fashion to destroy this truly honourable marriage, and to
defile this inviolate bed; and if we must name them one by one, we
charge with this adulterous spirit anger, avarice, envy, revenge,
enmity, malice, hatred, and whatever the Apostle puts in the class of
those things which are contrary to sound doctrine. Now let us suppose a
lady, prepossessing and lovely above her peers, and on that account
wedded to a king, but besieged because of her beauty by profligate
lovers. As long as she remains indignant at these would-be seducers and
complains of them to her lawful husband, she keeps her chastity and has
no one before her eyes but her bridegroom; the profligates find no
vantage ground for their attack upon her. But if she were to listen to a
single one of them, her chastity with regard to the rest would not
exempt her from the retribution; it would be sufficient to condemn her,
that she had allowed that one to defile the marriage bed. So the soul
whose life is in God will find her pleasure <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1447](#fn_1445) in no single one of those things
which make a beauteous show to deceive her. If she were, in some fit of
weakness, to admit the defilement to her heart, she would herself have
broken the covenant of her spiritual marriage; and, as the Scripture
tells us, “into the malicious soul Wisdom cannot come <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1448](#fn_1446) .” It may, in a word, be truly said
that the Good Husband cannot come to dwell with the soul that is
irascible, or malice-bearing, or harbours any other disposition which
jars with that concord. No way has been discovered of harmonizing things
whose nature is antagonistic and which have nothing in common. The
Apostle tells us there is “no communion of light with darkness <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1449](#fn_1447) ,” or of righteousness with
iniquity, or, in a word, of all the qualities which we perceive and name
as the essence of God’s nature, with all the opposite which are
perceived in evil. Seeing, then, the impossibility of any union between
mutual repellents, we understand that the vicious soul is estranged from
entertaining the company of the Good. What then is the practical lesson
from this? The chaste and thoughtful virgin must sever herself from any
affection which can in any way impart contagion to her soul; she must
keep herself pure for the Husband who has married her, “not having spot
or blemish or any such thing <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1450](#fn_1448)
.”

id="ix.ii.ii.xvi-p7.1"></span>.—Origen (c. Cels. vii. 48, 49), comparing
Pagan and Christian virginity, says, “The Athenian hierophant,
distrusting his power of self-control for the period of his regular
religious duties, uses hemlock, and passes as pure. But you may see
among the Christians men who need no hemlock. The Faith drives evil from
their minds, and ever fits them to perform the service of prayer.
Belonging to some of the gods now in vogue there are certainly virgins
here and there—watched or not I care not now to inquire—who seem not to
break down in the course of chastity which the honour of their god
requires. But amongst Christians, for no repute amongst men, for no
stipend, for no mere show, they practise an absolute virginity; and as
they ‘liked to retain God in their knowledge,’ so God has kept them in
that liking mind, and in the performance of fitting works, filling them
with righteousness and goodness. I say this without any depreciation of
what is beautiful in Greek thought, and of what is wholesome in their
teachings. I wish only to show that all they have said, and things more
noble, more divine, have been said by those men of God, the prophets and
apostles.”
