<span id="viii.ii.i-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="viii.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p3.1"></span>It</span> is important, for the understanding
of the following Book, to determine what faculty of the mind <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p3.2"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p3.3"></span>Επίνοια</span> is.
Eunomius, Gregory says, “makes a solemn travesty” of the word. He
reduces its force to its lowest level, and makes it only “fancy the
unnatural,” either contracting or extending the limits of nature, or
putting heterogeneous notions together. He instances colossi, pigmies,
centaurs, as the result of this mental operation. “Fancy,” or “notion,”
would thus represent Eunomius’ view of it. But Gregory ascribes every
art and every science to the play of this faculty. “According to my
account, it is the method by which we discover things that are unknown,
going on to further discoveries, by means of what adjoins and follows
from our first *perception* with regard to the thing studied.” He
instances Ontology (!), Arithmetic, Geometry, on the one hand,
Agriculture, Navigation, Horology, on the other, as the result of it.
“Any one who should judge this faculty more precious than any other with
the exercise of which we are gifted would not be far mistaken.”
“Induction” might almost represent this view of it. But then Gregory
does not deny that “lying wonders are also fabricated by it.” By means
of it “and entertainer might amuse an audience” with fire-breathing
monsters, men enfolded in the coils of serpents, &c. He calls it an
inventive faculty. It must therefore be something more spontaneous than
ratiocination, whether deductive or inductive; while it is more reliable
than Fancy or Imagination.

<span id="viii.ii.i-p4"></span>This is illustrated by what S. John
Damascene, in his Dialectica (c. 65), says of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p4.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p4.2"></span>Επίνοια</span>: “It is of two sorts. The
first is the faculty which analyses and elucidates the view of things
undissected and in the gross (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p4.3"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p4.4"></span>λοσχερῆ</span>): whereby a simple phenomenon
becomes complex speculatively: for instance, man becomes a compound of
soul and body. The second, by a union of perception and fancy, produces
fictions out of realities, *i.e.* divides wholes into parts, and
combines those parts, selected arbitrarily, into new wholes; *e.g.*
Centaurs, Sirens.” Analysis (scientific) would describe the one; fancy,
the other. Basil and Gregory were thinking of the one, Eunomius of the
other; but still both parties used the same expression.

<span id="viii.ii.i-p5"></span>If, then, there is one word that will
cover the whole meaning, it would seem to be “Conception.” This word at
all events, both in its outward form and in its intention, stands to
perception in a way strictly analogous to that in which <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p5.1"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p5.2"></span>Επίνοια</span> stands to
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p5.3"></span>῎</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p5.4"></span>Εννοια</span>. Both
Conception and <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p5.5"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p5.6"></span>Επίνοια</span> represent some *regulated*
operation of the mind upon data immediately given. In both cases the
mind is led to contemplate in a new light its own contents, whether
sensations or innate ideas. The fitness of Conception as an equivalent
of <span class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p5.7"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p5.8"></span>Επίνοια</span> will be
clear when we consider the real point at issue between Basil and
Eunomius. Their controversy rages round the term Ungenerate. Is it, or
is it not, expressive of the substance (being) of the Deity? To answer
this question, it was found necessary to ascertain how such a name for
the Supreme has been acquired. “By a conception,” says Basil. “No,” says
Eunomius: “it would be dangerous to trust the naming of the Deity to a
common operation of the mind. The faculty of Conception may and does
play us false; it can create monstrosities. Besides, if the names of the
Father are conceptions, the names of the Son are too; for instance, the
Door, the Shepherd, the Axe, the Vine. But as our Lord Himself applied
these to Himself, He would, according to you, be employing the faculty
of conception; and it is blasphemous to think that He employed names
which we too might have arrived at by conceiving of Him in these
particular ways. Therefore, Conception is not the Source of the Divine
Names; but rather they come from a perception or intention implanted in
us directly from on High. Ungenerate is such a name; and it reveals to
us the very substance of the Deity.” But Gregory defends Basil’s
position. He shows the entire relativity of our knowledge of the Deity.
Ungenerate and every other name of God is due to a conception; in each
case we *perceive* either an operation of the Deity, or an element of
evil, and then we *conceive* of Him as operating in the one, or as free
from the other; and so name Him. But there is no conception, because
there is no perception, of the substance of the Deity. Scripture, which
has revealed His operations, has not revealed that. “The human
mind…feels after the unutterable Being in divers and many-sided ways;
and never chases the mystery in the light of one idea alone. Our
grasping of Him would indeed be easy, if there lay before us one single
assigned path to the knowledge of God; but, as it is, from the skill
apparent in the Universe, we get the idea of skill in the Ruler of the
Universe;…and again, when we see the execrable character of evil, we
grasp His own unalterable pureness as regards this,…not that we split up
the subject of such attributes along with them, but, believing that this
Being, whatever it be in substance, is one, we still conceive that it
has something in common with all these ideas.”

<span id="viii.ii.i-p6"></span>To sum up, it had suited Eunomius to try
to disparage <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p6.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p6.2"></span>Επίνοια</span> so far as to make it appear
morally impossible that any name of God, but especially <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p6.3"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p6.4"></span>Αγέννητος</span>, should
be derived from such a source. He scoffs at the orthodox party for
treating the privative terms for the Deity as *merely privative,*
embodying only a “notion,” and for adhering to the truth that God’s name
is “above every name.” He “does not see how God can be above His works
simply by virtue of such things as do not belong to Him;” this is only
“giving to words the prerogative over realities.” He wants, and believes
in the existence of, a word for the *substance* of God, and he finds it
in <span class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p6.5"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.i-p6.6"></span>Αγέννητος</span>, which
according to him is not privative at all; it is the single name for the
single Deity, and all the others are bound up in it. “The universal
Guardian thought it right to engraft these names in our minds by a *law
of His creation.*” “These utterances are *from above.*” The importance
of this word to the Anomœans is obvious. Gregory, as spokesman of the
Nicene party, defends the efficacy of the mental operation of conception
to supply terms for the Deity, which, however, can *none* of them be
final. God *is* incomprehensible. At the same time there is a spiritual
insight of God (an <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p6.7"></span>ἔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p6.8"></span>ννοια</span> in fact) which far surpasses
Eunomius’ intellectual certainty (see note p. 256).
