id="xi.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xix-p2.1"></span>But</span> it will be said that the objection
which has been brought against us has not yet been solved, and that what
unbelievers have urged has been rather strengthened by all we have said.
For if, as our argument has shown, there is such power in Him that both
the destruction of death and the introduction of life resides in Him,
why does He not effect His purpose by the mere exercise of His will,
instead of working out our salvation in such a roundabout way, by being
born and nurtured as a man, and even, while he was saving man, tasting
death; when it was possible for Him to have saved man without subjecting
Himself to such conditions? Now to this, with all candid persons, it
were sufficient to reply, that the sick do not dictate to their
physicians the measures for their recovery, nor cavil with those who do
them good as to the method of their healing; why, for instance, the
medical man felt the diseased part and devised this or that particular
remedy for the removal of the complaint, when they expected another; but
the patient looks to the end and aim of the good work, and receives the
benefit with gratitude. Seeing, however, as says the Prophet <span
id="fr_1983"></span>[1985](#fn_1983.md) , that God’s abounding goodness
<span id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span
id="xi.ii.xix-Page_490"></span>keeps its utility concealed, and is not
seen in complete clearness in this present life—otherwise, if the eyes
could behold all that is hoped for, every objection of unbelievers would
be removed,—but, as it is, abides the ages that are coming, when what is
at present seen only by the eye of faith must be revealed, it is needful
accordingly that, as far as we may, we should by the aid of arguments,
the best within our reach, attempt to discover for these difficulties
also a solution in harmony with what has gone before.

appear. Jerome twice translates the <span class="Greek"><span

later sense of <span class="Greek"><span

“serviceableness” and then “uprightness” (<span
