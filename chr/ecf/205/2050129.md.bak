<span id="viii.i.xiii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.i.xiii.iii-p1"></span> §3. *He then exposes the ignorance
of Eunomius, and the incoherence and absurdity of his arguments, in
speaking of the Son as “the Angel of the Existent,” and as being as much
below the Divine Nature as the Son is superior to the things created by
Himself. And in this connection there is a noble and forcible
counter-statement and an indignant refutation, showing that He Who gave
the oracles to Moses is Himself the Existent, the Only-begotten Son, Who
to the petition of Moses, “If Thou Thyself goest not with us, carry me
not up hence,” said, “I will do this also that thou hast said”; Who is
also called “Angel” both by Moses and Isaiah: wherein is cited the text,
“Unto us a Child is born.”*

<span id="viii.i.xiii.iii-p2"></span>But that the research and culture
of our imposing author may be completely disclosed, we will consider
sentence by sentence his presentment of his sentiments. “The Son,” he
says, “does not appropriate the dignity of the Existent,” giving the
name of “dignity” to the actual fact of being:—(with what propriety he
knows how to adapt words to things!)—and since He is “by reason of the
Father,” he says that He is alienated from Himself on the ground that
the essence which is supreme over Him attracts to itself the conception
of the Existent. This is much the same as if one were to say that he who
is bought for money, in so far as he *is* in his own existence, is not
the person bought, but the purchaser, inasmuch as his essential personal
existence is absorbed into the nature of him who has acquired authority
over him. Such are the lofty conceptions of our divine: but what is the
demonstration of his statements?….“the Only-begotten,” he says, “Himself
ascribing to the Father the title due of right to Him alone,” and then
he introduces the point that the Father alone is good. Where in this
does the Son disclaim the title of “Existent”? Yet this is what Eunomius
is driving at when he goes on word for word as follows:—“For He Who has
taught us that the appellation ‘good’ belongs to Him alone Who is the
cause of His own goodness and of all goodness, and is so at all times,
and Who refers to Him all good that has ever come into being, would be
slow to appropriate to Himself the authority over all things that have
come into being, and the title of ‘the Existent.’” What has “authority”
to do with the context? and how along with this is the Son also
alienated from the title of “Existent”? But really I do not know what
one ought rather to do at this,—to laugh at the want of education, or to
pity the pernicious folly which it displays. For the expression, “His
own,” not employed according to the natural meaning, and as those who
know how to use language are wont to use it, attests his extensive
knowledge of the grammar of pronouns, which even little boys get up with
their masters without trouble, and his ridiculous wandering from the
subject to what has nothing to do either with his argument or with the
form of that argument, considered as syllogistic, namely, that the Son
has no share in the appellation of “Existent”—an assertion adapted to
his monstrous inventions <span id="fr_988"></span>[990](#fn_988.md) ,—this
and similar absurdities seem combined together for the purpose of
provoking laughter; so that it may be that readers of the more careless
sort experience some such inclination, and are amused by the
disjointedness of his arguments. But that God the Word should not exist,
or that He at all events should not be good (and this is what Eunomius
maintains when he says that He does not “appropriate the title” of
“Existent” and “good”), and to make out that the authority over all
things that come into being does not belong to him,—this calls for our
tears, and for a wail of mourning.

<span id="viii.i.xiii.iii-p4"></span>For it is not as if he had but let
fall something of the kind just once under some headlong and
inconsiderate impulse, and in what followed had striven to retrieve his
error: no, he dallies lingeringly with the malignity, striving in his
later statements to surpass what had gone before. For as he proceeds, he
says that the Son is the same distance below the Divine Nature as the
nature of angels is subjected below His own, not indeed saying this in
so many words, but endeavouring by what he does say to produce such an
impression. The reader may judge for himself the meaning of his words:
they run as follows,—“Who, by being called <span id="page_CCXXXIV">p.
CCXXXIV</span> <span id="viii.i.xiii.iii-Page_CCXXXIV"></span>‘Angel,’
clearly showed by Whom He published His words, and Who is the Existent,
while by being addressed also as God, He showed His superiority over all
things. For He Who is the God of all things that were made by Him, is
the Angel of the God over all.” Indignation rushes into my heart and
interrupts my discourse, and under this emotion arguments are lost in a
turmoil of anger roused by words like these. And perhaps I may be
pardoned for feeling such emotion. For whose resentment would not be
stirred within him at such profanity, when he remembers how the Apostle
proclaims that every angelic nature is subject to the Lord, and in
witness of his doctrine invokes the sublime utterances of the
prophets:—“When He bringeth the first-begotten into the world, He saith,
And let all the angels of God worship Him,” and, “Thy throne, O God, is
for ever and ever,” and, “Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not
fail <span id="fr_989"></span>[991](#fn_989.md) ”? When the Apostle has
gone through all this argument to demonstrate the unapproachable majesty
of the Only-begotten God, what must I feel when I hear from the
adversary of Christ that the Lord of Angels is Himself only an
Angel,—and when he does not let such a statement fall by chance, but
puts forth his strength to maintain this monstrous invention, so that it
may be established that his Lord has no superiority over John and Moses?
For the word says concerning them, “This is he of whom it is written,
‘Behold I send my angel before thy face <span
id="fr_990"></span>[992](#fn_990.md) .’” John therefore is an angel. But
the enemy of the Lord, even though he grants his Lord the name of God,
yet makes Him out to be on a level with the deity of Moses, since he too
was a servant of the God over all, and was constituted a god to the
Egyptians <span id="fr_991"></span>[993](#fn_991.md) . And yet this phrase,
“over all,” as has been previously observed, is common to the Son with
the Father, the Apostle having expressly ascribed such a title to Him,
when he says, “Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is God
over all <span id="fr_992"></span>[994](#fn_992.md) .” But this man
degrades the Lord of angels to the rank of an angel, as though he had
not heard that the angels are “ministering spirits,” and “a flame of
fire <span id="fr_993"></span>[995](#fn_993.md) .” For by the use of these
distinctive terms does the Apostle make the difference between the
several subjects clear and unmistakable, defining the subordinate nature
to be “spirits” and “fire,” and distinguishing the supreme power by the
name of Godhead. And yet, though there are so many that proclaim the
glory of the Only-begotten God, against them all Eunomius lifts up his
single voice, calling the Christ “an angel of the God over all,”
defining Him, by thus contrasting Him with the “God over all,” to be one
of the “all things,” and, by giving Him the same name as the angels,
trying to establish that He no wise differs from them in nature: for he
has often previously said that all those things which share the same
name cannot be different in nature. Does the argument, then, still lack
its censors, as it concerns a man who proclaims in so many words that
the “Angel” does not publish His own word, but that of the Existent? For
it is by this means that he tries to show that the Word Who was in the
beginning, the Word Who was God, is not Himself the Word, but is the
Word of some other Word, being its minister and “angel.” And who knows
not that the only opposite to the “Existent” is the nonexistent? so that
he who contrasts the Son with the Existent, is clearly playing the Jew,
robbing the Christian doctrine of the Person of the Only-begotten. For
in saying that He is excluded from the title of the “Existent,” he is
assuredly trying to establish also that He is outside the pale of
existence: for surely if he grants Him existence, he will not quarrel
about the sound of the word.

<span id="viii.i.xiii.iii-p10"></span>But he strives to prop up his
absurdity by the testimony of Scripture, and puts forth Moses as his
advocate against the truth. For as though that were the source from
which he drew his arguments, he freely sets forth to us his own fables,
saying, “He Who sent Moses was the Existent Himself, but He by Whom He
sent and spake was the Angel <span id="page_CCXXXV">p. CCXXXV</span>
<span id="viii.i.xiii.iii-Page_CCXXXV"></span>of the Existent, and the
God of all else.” That his statement, however, is not drawn from
Scripture, may be conclusively proved by Scripture itself. But if he
says that this is the sense of what is written, we must examine the
original language of Scripture. Moreover let us first notice that
Eunomius, after calling the Lord God of all things after Him, allows Him
no superiority in comparison with the angelic nature. For neither did
Moses, when he heard that he was made a god to Pharaoh <span
id="fr_994"></span>[996](#fn_994.md) , pass beyond the bounds of humanity,
but while in nature he was on an equality with his fellows, he was
raised above them by superiority of authority, and his being called a
god did not hinder him from being man. So too in this case Eunomius,
while making out the Son to be one of the angels, salves over such an
error by the appellation of Godhead, in the manner expressed, allowing
Him the title of God in some equivocal sense. Let us once more set down
and examine the very words in which he delivers his blasphemy. “He Who
sent Moses was the Existent Himself, but He by Whom He sent was the
Angel of the Existent”—this, namely “Angel,” being the title he gives
his Lord. Well, the absurdity of our author is refuted by the Scripture
itself, in the passage where Moses beseeches the Lord not to entrust an
angel with the leadership of the people, but Himself to conduct their
march. The passage runs thus: God is speaking, “Go, get thee down, guide
this people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold Mine
Angel shall go before thee in the day when I visit <span
id="fr_995"></span>[997](#fn_995.md) .” And a little while after He says
again, “And I will send Mine Angel before thee <span
id="fr_996"></span>[998](#fn_996.md) .” Then, a little after what
immediately follows, comes the supplication to God on the part of His
servant, running on this wise, “If I have found grace in Thy sight, let
my Lord go among us <span id="fr_997"></span>[999](#fn_997.md) ,” and
again, “If Thou Thyself go not with us, carry me not up hence <span
id="fr_998"></span>[1000](#fn_998.md) ”; and then the answer of God to
Moses, “I will do for thee this thing also that thou hast spoken: for
thou hast found grace in My sight, and I know thee above all men <span
id="fr_999"></span>[1001](#fn_999.md) .” Accordingly, if Moses begs that
the people may not be led by an angel, and if He Who was discoursing
with him consents to become his fellow-traveller and the guide of the
army, it is hereby manifestly shown that He Who made Himself known by
the title of “the Existent” is the Only-begotten God.

<span id="viii.i.xiii.iii-p17"></span>If any one gainsays this, he will
show himself to be a supporter of the Jewish persuasion in not
associating the Son with the deliverance of the people. For if, on the
one hand, it was not an angel that went forth with the people, and if,
on the other, as Eunomius would have it, He Who was manifested by the
name of the Existent is not the Only-begotten, this amounts to nothing
less than transferring the doctrines of the synagogue to the Church of
God. Accordingly, of the two alternatives they must needs admit one,
namely, either that the Only-begotten God on no occasion appeared to
Moses, or that the Son is Himself the “Existent,” from Whom the word
came to His servant. But he contradicts what has been said above,
alleging the Scripture itself <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1002](#fn_1000.md)
which informs us that the voice of an angel was interposed, and that it
was thus that the discourse of the Existent was conveyed. This, however,
is no contradiction, but a confirmation of our view. For we too say
plainly, that the prophet, wishing to make manifest to men the mystery
concerning Christ, called the Self-Existent “Angel,” that the meaning of
the words might not be referred to the Father, as it would have been if
the title of “Existent” alone had been found throughout the discourse.
But just as our word is the revealer and messenger (or “angel”) of the
movements of the mind, even so we affirm that the true Word that was in
the beginning, when He announces the will of His own Father, is styled
“Angel” (or “Messenger”), a title given to Him on account of the
operation of conveying the message. And as the sublime John, having
previously called Him “Word,” so introduces the further truth that the
Word was God, that our thoughts might not at once turn to the Father, as
they would have done if the title of God had been put first, so too does
the mighty Moses, after first calling Him “Angel,” teach us in the words
that follow that He is none other than the Self-Existent Himself, that
the mystery concerning the Christ might be foreshown, by the Scripture
assuring us by the name “Angel,” that the Word is the interpreter of the
Father’s will, and, by the title of the “Self-Existent,” of the
closeness of relation subsisting between the Son and the Father. And if
he should bring forward Isaiah also as calling Him “the *Angel* of
mighty counsel <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1003](#fn_1001.md) ,” not even so
will he overthrow our argument. For there, in clear and uncontrovertible
terms, there is indicated by the prophecy the dispensation of His
Humanity; for “unto us,” he says, “a Child is born, unto us a Son is
given, and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name is
called the Angel of mighty counsel.” And it is with an eye to this, I
suppose, that David describes the establishment of His kingdom, not as
though He were not a King, but in the view that the humiliation to the
estate of a servant to which the Lord submitted by way of dispensation,
was taken up and absorbed into the majesty of His Kingdom. For he says,
“I was established King by Him on His holy hill of Sion, declaring the
ordinance of the Lord.” <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1004](#fn_1002.md)
Accordingly, He Who through Himself reveals the goodness of the Father
is called “Angel” and “Word,” “Seal” and “Image,” and all similar titles
with the same intention. For as the “Angel” (or “Messenger”) gives
information from some one, even so the Word reveals the thought within,
the Seal shows by Its own stamp the original mould, and the Image by
Itself interprets the beauty of that whereof It is the image, so that in
their signification all these terms are equivalent to one another. For
this reason the title “Angel” is placed before that of the
“Self-Existent,” the Son being termed “Angel” as the exponent of His
Father’s will, and the “Existent” as having no name that could possibly
give a knowledge of His essence, but transcending all the power of names
to express. Wherefore also His name is testified by the <span
id="page_CCXXXVI">p. CCXXXVI</span> <span
id="viii.i.xiii.iii-Page_CCXXXVI"></span>writing of the Apostle to be
“above every name <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1005](#fn_1003.md) ,” not as
though it were some one name preferred above all others, though still
comparable with them, but rather in the sense that He Who verily *is* is
above every name.
