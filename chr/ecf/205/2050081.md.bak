<span id="viii.i.v.vi"></span>

<span id="viii.i.v.vi-p1"></span> §6. *Thereafter he expounds the
appellation of “Son,” and of “product of generation,” and very many
varieties of “sons,” of God, of men, of rams, of perdition, of light,
and of day.*

<span id="viii.i.v.vi-p2"></span>But our discourse has diverged too far
from the subject before us, in following out the questions which arise
from time to time by way of inference. Let us therefore once more resume
its sequence, as I imagine that the phrase under examination has been
sufficiently shown, by what we have said, to be contradictory not only
to the truth, but also to itself. For if, <span id="page_CXLVIII">p.
CXLVIII</span> <span id="viii.i.v.vi-Page_CXLVIII"></span>according to
their view, the natural relation to the Father is established by the
appellation of “the Son,” and so with that of the “product of
generation” to Him Who has begotten Him (as these men’s wisdom falsely
models the terms significant of the Divine nature into a verbal
arrangement, according to some grammatical frivolity), no one could
longer doubt that the mutual relation of the names which is established
by nature is a proof of their kindred, or rather of their identity of
essence. But let not our discourse merely turn about our adversaries’
words, that the orthodox doctrine may not seem to gain the victory only
by the weakness of those who fight against it, but appear to have an
abundant supply of strength in itself. Let the adverse argument,
therefore, be strengthened as much as may be by us ourselves with more
energetic advocacy, that the superiority of our force may be recognized
with full confidence, as we bring to the unerring test of truth those
arguments also which our adversaries have omitted. He who contends on
behalf of our adversaries will perhaps say that the name of “Son,” or
“product of generation,” does not by any means establish the fact of
kindred in nature. For in Scripture the term “child of wrath <span
id="fr_591"></span>[593](#fn_591.md) ” is used, and “son of perdition <span
id="fr_592"></span>[594](#fn_592.md) ,” and “product of a viper <span
id="fr_593"></span>[595](#fn_593.md) ;” and in such names surely no
community of nature is apparent. For Judas, who is called “the son of
perdition,” is not in his substance the same with perdition, according
to what we understand by the word <span
id="fr_594"></span>[596](#fn_594.md) . For the signification of the “man”
in Judas is one thing, and that of “perdition” is another. And the
argument may be established equally from an opposite instance. For those
who are called in a certain sense “children of light,” and “children of
the day <span id="fr_595"></span>[597](#fn_595.md) ,” are not the same with
light and day in respect of the definition of their nature, and the
stones are made Abraham’s children <span
id="fr_596"></span>[598](#fn_596.md) when they claim their kindred with him
by faith and works; and those who are “led by the Spirit of God,” as the
Apostle says, are called “Sons of God <span
id="fr_597"></span>[599](#fn_597.md) ,” without being the same with God in
respect of nature; and one may collect many such instances from the
inspired Scripture, by means of which deceit, like some image decked
with the testimonies of Scripture, masquerades in the likeness of truth.

<span id="viii.i.v.vi-p10"></span>Well, what do we say to this? The
divine Scripture knows how to use the word “Son” in both senses, so that
in some cases such an appellation is derived from nature, in others it
is adventitious and artificial. For when it speaks of “sons of men,” or
“sons of rams <span id="fr_598"></span>[600](#fn_598.md) ,” it marks the
essential relation of that which is begotten to that from which it has
its being: but when it speaks of “sons of power,” or “children of God,”
it presents to us that kinship which is the result of choice. And,
moreover, in the opposite sense, too, the same persons are called “sons
of Eli,” and “sons of Belial <span id="fr_599"></span>[601](#fn_599.md) ,”
the appellation of “sons” being easily adapted to either idea. For when
they are called “sons of Eli,” they are declared to have natural
relationship to him, but in being called “sons of Belial,” they are
reproved for the wickedness of their choice, as no longer emulating
their father in their life, but addicting their own purpose to sin. In
the case, then, of this lower nature of ours, and of the things with
which we are concerned, by reason of human nature being equally inclined
to either side (I mean, to vice and to virtue), it is in our power to
become sons either of night or of day, while our nature yet remains, so
far as the chief part of it is concerned, within its proper limits. For
neither is he who by sin becomes a child of wrath alienated from his
human generation, nor does he who by choice addicts himself to good
reject his human origin by the refinement of his habits, but, while
their nature in each case remains the same, the differences of their
purpose assume the names of their relationship, according as they become
either children of God by virtue, or of the opposite by vice.

<span id="viii.i.v.vi-p13"></span>But how does Eunomius, in the case of
the divine doctrines at least—he who “preserves the natural order” (for
I will use our author’s very words), “and abides by those things which
are known to us from the beginning, and does not refuse to call Him that
is begotten by the name of ‘product of generation,’ since the generated
essence itself” (as he says) “and the appellation of ‘Son’ makes such a
relation of words appropriate”,—how does he alienate the Begotten from
essential kindred with Him that begat Him? For in the case of those who
are called “sons” or “products” by way of reproach, or again where some
praise accompanies such names, we cannot say that any one is called “a
child of wrath,” being at the same time actually begotten by wrath; nor
again had any one the day for his mother, in a corporeal sense, that he
should be called its son; but it is the difference of their will which
gives occasion for names of such relationship. Here, however, Eunomius
says, “we do not refuse to call the Son, seeing He is begotten, by the
name of ‘product of generation,’ since the generated essence,” he tells
us, “and the appellation of ‘Son,’ makes such a relation of words
appropriate.” If, then, he confesses that such a relation of words is
<span id="page_CXLIX">p. CXLIX</span> <span
id="viii.i.v.vi-Page_CXLIX"></span>made appropriate by the fact that the
Son is really a “product of generation,” how is it opportune to assign
such a rationale of names, alike to those which are used inexactly by
way of metaphor, and to those where the natural relation, as Eunomius
tells us, makes such a use of names appropriate? Surely such an account
is true only in the case of those whose nature is a border-land between
virtue and vice, where one often shares in turn opposite classes of
names, becoming a child, now of light, then again of darkness, by reason
of affinity to the good or to its opposite. But where contraries have no
place, one could no longer say that the word “Son” is applied
metaphorically, in like manner as in the case of those who by choice
appropriate the title to themselves. For one could not arrive at this
view, that, as a man casting off the works of darkness becomes, by his
decent life, a child of light, so too the Only-begotten God received the
more honourable name as the result of a change from the inferior state.
For one who is a man becomes a son of God by being joined to Christ by
spiritual generation: but He Who by Himself makes the man to be a son of
God does not need another Son to bestow on Him the adoption of a son,
but has the name also of that which He is by nature. A man himself
changes himself, exchanging the old man for the new; but to what shall
God be changed, so that He may receive what He has not? A man puts off
himself, and puts on the Divine nature; but what does He put off, or in
what does He array Himself, Who is always the same? A man becomes a son
of God, receiving what he has not, and laying aside what he has; but He
Who has never been in the state of vice has neither anything to receive
nor anything to relinquish. Again, the man may be on the one hand truly
called some one’s son, when one speaks with reference to his nature;
and, on the other hand, he may be so called inexactly, when the choice
of his life imposes the name. But God, being One Good, in a single and
uncompounded nature, looks ever the same way, and is never changed by
the impulse of choice, but always wishes what He is, and is, assuredly,
what He wishes: so that He is in both respects properly and truly called
Son of God, since His nature contains the good, and His choice also is
never severed from that which is more excellent, so that this word is
employed, without inexactness, as His name. Thus there is no room for
these arguments (which, in the person of our adversaries, we have been
opposing to ourselves), to be brought forward by our adversaries as a
demurrer to the affinity in respect of nature.
