<span id="viii.i.xiv.v"></span>

<span id="viii.i.xiv.v-p1"></span> §5. *Then, again discussing the true
Light and unapproachable Light of the Father and of the Son, special
attributes, community and essence, and showing the relation of
“generate” and “ungenerate,” as involving no opposition in sense* <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1061](#fn_1059.md) *, but presenting an opposition and
contradiction admitting of no middle term, he ends the book.*

<span id="viii.i.xiv.v-p3"></span>But I feel that my argument is running
away with me, for it does not remain in the regular course, but, like
some hot-blooded and spirited colt, is carried away by the blasphemies
of our opponents to range over the absurdities of their system.
Accordingly we must restrain it when it would run wild beyond the bounds
of moderation in demonstration of absurd consequences. But the kindly
reader will doubtless pardon what we have said, not imputing the
absurdity that emerges from our investigation to us, but to those who
laid down such mischievous premises. We must, however, now transfer our
attention to another of his statements. <span id="page_CCXLVII">p.
CCXLVII</span> <span id="viii.i.xiv.v-Page_CCXLVII"></span>For he says
that our God also is composite, in that while we suppose the Light to be
common, we yet separate the one Light from the other by certain special
attributes and various differences. For that is none the less composite
which, while united by one common nature, is yet separated by certain
differences and conjunctions of peculiarities <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1062](#fn_1060.md) . To this our answer is short and
easily dismissed. For what he brings as matter of accusation against our
doctrines we acknowledge against ourselves, if he is not found to
establish the same position by his own words. Let us just consider what
he has written. He calls the Lord “true” Light, and the Father Light
“unapproachable.” Accordingly, by thus naming each, he also acknowledges
their community in respect to light. But as titles are applied to things
because they fit them, as he has often insisted, we do not conceive that
the name of “light” is used of the Divine Nature barely, apart from some
meaning, but rather that it is predicated by virtue of some underlying
reality. Accordingly, by the use of a common name, they recognize the
identity of the objects signified, since they have already declared that
the natures of those things which have the same name cannot be
different. Since, then, the meaning of “Light” is one and the same, the
addition of “unapproachable” and “true,” according to the language of
heresy, separates the common nature by specific differences, so that the
Light of the Father is conceived as one thing, and the Light of the Son
as another, separated one from the other by special properties. Let him,
then, either overthrow his own positions to avoid making out by his
statements that the Deity is composite, or let him abstain from charging
against us what he may see contained in his own language. For our
statement does not hereby violate the simplicity of the Godhead, since
community and specific difference are not essence, so that the
conjunction of these should render the subject composite <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1063](#fn_1061.md) . But on the one side the essence
by itself remains whatever it is in nature, being what it is, while, on
the other, every one possessed of reason would say that these—community
and specific difference—were among the accompanying conceptions and
attributes: since even in us men there may be discerned some community
with the Divine Nature, but Divinity is not the more on that account
humanity, or humanity Divinity. For while we believe that God is good,
we also find this character predicated of men in Scripture. But the
special signification in each case establishes a distinction in the
community arising from the use of the homonymous term. For He Who is the
fountain of goodness is named from it; but he who has some share of
goodness also partakes in the name, and God is not for this reason
composite, that He shares with men the title of “good.” From these
considerations it must obviously be allowed that the idea of community
is one thing, and that of essence another, and we are not on that
account any the more to maintain composition or multiplicity of parts in
that simple Nature which has nothing to do with quantity, because some
of the attributes we contemplate in It are either regarded as special,
or have a sort of common significance.

<span id="viii.i.xiv.v-p6"></span>But let us pass on, if it seems good,
to another of his statements, and dismiss the nonsense that comes
between. He who laboriously reiterates against our argument the
Aristotelian division of existent things, has elaborated “genera,” and
“species,” and “differentiæ,” and “individuals,” and advanced all the
technical language of the categories for the injury of our doctrines.
Let us pass by all this, and turn our discourse to deal with his heavy
and irresistible argument. For having braced his argument with
Demosthenic fervour, he has started up to our view as a second Pæanian
of Oltiseris <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1064](#fn_1062.md) , imitating that
orator’s severity in his struggle with us. I will transcribe the
language of our author word for word. “Yes,” he says, “but if, as the
generate is contrary to the ungenerate, the Generate Light be equally
inferior to the Ungenerate Light, the one will be found to be <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1065](#fn_1063.md) light, the other darkness.” Let him
who has the leisure learn from his words how pungent is his mode of
dealing with this opposition, and how exactly it hits the mark. But I
would beg this imitator of our words either to say what we have said, or
to make his imitation of it as close as may be, or else, if he deals
with our argument according to his own education and ability, to speak
in his own person and not in ours. For I hope that no one will so miss
our meaning as to suppose that, while “generate” is contradictory in
sense to “ungenerate,” one is a diminution of the other. For the
difference between contradictories is not one of greater or less
intensity, but rests its opposition upon their being mutually exclusive
in their signification: as, for example, we say that a man is asleep or
not asleep, sitting or not sitting, that he was or was not, and all the
rest after the same model, where the denial of one is the assertion of
its <span id="page_CCXLVIII">p. CCXLVIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.xiv.v-Page_CCXLVIII"></span>contradictory. As, then, to live
is not a diminution of not living, but its complete opposite, even so we
conceived having been generated not as a diminution of not having been
generated, but as an opposite and contradictory not admitting of any
middle term, so that which is expressed by the one has nothing whatever
to do with that which is expressed by the other in the way of less or
more. Let him therefore who says that one of two contradictories is
*defective* as compared with the other, speak in his own person, not in
ours. For our homely language says that things which correspond to
contradictories differ from one another even as their originals do. So
that, even if Eunomius discerns in the Light the same divergence as in
the generate compared with the Ungenerate, I will re-assert my
statement, that as in the one case the one member of the contradiction
has nothing in common with its opposite, so if “light” be placed on the
same side as one of the two contradictories, the remaining place in the
figure must of course be assigned to “darkness,” the necessity of the
antithesis arranging the term of light over against its opposite, in
accordance with the analogy of the previous contradictory terms
“generate” and “ungenerate.” Such is the clumsy answer which we, who as
our disparaging author says, have attempted to write without logical
training, deliver in our rustic dialect to our new Pæanian. But to see
how he contended with this contradiction, advancing against us those hot
and fire-breathing words of his with Demosthenic intensity, let those
who like to have a laugh study the treatise of our orator itself. For
our pen is not very hard to rouse to confute the notions of impiety, but
is quite unsuited to the task of ridiculing the ignorance of untutored
minds.
