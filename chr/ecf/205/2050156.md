<span id="ix.ii.ii.vii-p1"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>This</span>, I believe, makes the
greatness of the prophet Elias, and of him who afterwards appeared in
the spirit and power of Elias, than whom “of those that are born of
women there was none greater <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1376](#fn_1374)
.” If their history conveys any other mystic lesson, surely this above
all is taught by their special mode of life, that the man whose thoughts
are fixed upon the invisible is necessarily separated from all the
ordinary events of life; his judgments as to the True Good cannot be
confused and led astray by the deceits arising from the senses. Both,
from their youth upwards, exiled themselves from human society, and in a
way from human nature, in their neglect of the usual kinds of meat and
drink, and their sojourn in the desert. The wants of each were satisfied
by the nourishment that came in their way, so that their taste might
remain simple and unspoilt, as their ears were free from any distracting
noise, and their eyes from any wandering look. Thus they attained a
cloudless calm of soul, and were raised to that height of Divine favour
which Scripture records of each. Elias, for instance, became the
dispenser of God’s earthly gifts; he had authority to close at will the
uses of the sky against the sinners and to open them to the penitent.
John is not said indeed to have done any miracle; but the gift in him
was pronounced by Him Who sees the secrets of a man greater than any
prophet’s. This was so, we may presume, because both, from beginning to
end, so dedicated their hearts to the Lord that they were unsullied by
any earthly passion; because the love of wife or child, or any other
human call, did not intrude upon them, and they did not even think their
daily sustenance worthy of anxious thought; because they showed
themselves to be above any magnificence <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[1377](#fn_1375) of dress, and made shift with that
which chance offered them, one clothing himself in goat-skins, the other
with camel’s hair. It is my belief that they would not have reached to
this loftiness of spirit, if marriage had softened them. This is not
simple history only; it is “written for our admonition <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1378](#fn_1376) ,” that we might direct our lives
by theirs. What, then, do we learn thereby? This: that the man who longs
for union with God must, like those saints, detach his mind from all
worldly business. It is impossible for the mind which is poured into
many channels to win its way to the knowledge and the love of God.
