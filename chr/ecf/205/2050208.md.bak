<span id="x.ii.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> XXVI. *That the resurrection is not
beyond probability* <span id="fr_1722"></span>[1724](#fn_1722.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxvii-p3"></span>1. There are, however, some who,
owing to the feebleness of human reasoning, judging the Divine power by
the compass of our own, maintain that what is beyond our capacity is not
possible even to God. They point to the disappearance of the dead of old
time, and to the remains of those who have been reduced to ashes by
fire; and further, besides these, they bring forward in idea the
carnivorous beasts, and the fish that receives in its own body the flesh
of the shipwrecked sailor, while this again in turn becomes food for
men, and passes by digestion into the bulk of him who eats it: and they
rehearse many such trivialities, unworthy of God’s great power and
authority, for the overthrow of the doctrine, arguing as though God were
not able to restore to man his own, by return <span
id="fr_1723"></span>[1725](#fn_1723.md) through the same ways.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxvii-p5"></span>2. But we briefly cut short their
long circuits of logical folly by acknowledging that dissolution of the
body into its component parts does take place, and not only does earth,
according to the Divine word, return to earth, but air and moisture also
revert to the kindred element, and there takes place a return of each of
our components to that nature to which it is allied; and although the
human body be dispersed among carnivorous birds, or among the most
savage beasts by becoming their food, and although it pass beneath the
teeth of fish, and although it be changed by fire into vapour and dust,
wheresoever one may in argument suppose the man to be removed, he surely
remains in the world; and the world, the voice of inspiration tells us,
is held by the hand of God. If thou, then, art not ignorant of any of
the things in thy hand, dost thou deem the knowledge of God to be
feebler than thine own power, that it should fail to discover the most
minute of the things that are within the compass of the Divine span?
