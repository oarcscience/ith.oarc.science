<span id="xi.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>That</span> there is, then, a Word of God,
and a Breath of God, the Greek, with his “innate ideas” <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1953](#fn_1951.md) , and the Jew, with his Scriptures,
will perhaps not deny. But the dispensation as regards the Word of God,
whereby He became man, both parties would perhaps equally reject, as
being incredible and unfitting to be told of God. By starting,
therefore, from another point we will bring these gainsayers to a belief
in this fact. They believe that all things came into being by thought
and skill on the part of Him Who framed the system of the universe; or
else they hold views that do not conform to this opinion. But should
they not grant that reason and wisdom guided the framing of the world,
they will install unreason and unskilfulness on the throne of the
universe. But if this is an absurdity and impiety, it is abundantly
plain that they must allow that thought and skill rule the world. Now in
what has been previously said, the Word of God has been shown not to be
this actual utterance of speech, or the possession of some science or
art, but to be a power essentially and substantially existing, willing
all good, and being possessed of strength to execute all its will; and,
of a world that is good, this power appetitive and creative of good is
the cause. If, then, the subsistence of the whole world has been made to
depend on the power of the Word, as the train of the argument has shown,
an absolute necessity prevents us entertaining the thought of there
being any other cause of the organization of the several parts of the
world than the Word Himself, through whom all things in it passed into
being. If any one wants to call Him Word, or Skill, or Power, or God, or
anything else that is high and prized, we will not quarrel with him. For
whatever word or name be invented as descriptive of the subject, one
thing is intended by the expressions, namely the eternal power of God
which is creative of things that are, the discoverer of things that are
not, the sustaining cause of things that are brought into being, the
foreseeing cause of things yet to be. This, then, whether it be God, or
Word, or Skill, or Power, has been shown by inference to be the Maker of
the nature of man, not urged to framing him by any necessity, but in the
superabundance of love operating the production of such a creature. For
needful it was that neither His light should be unseen, nor His glory
without witness, nor His goodness unenjoyed, nor that any other quality
observed in the Divine nature should in any case lie idle, with none to
share it or enjoy it. If, therefore, man comes to his birth upon these
conditions, namely to be a partaker of the good things in God,
necessarily he is framed of such a kind as to be adapted to the
participation of such good. For as the eye, by virtue of the bright ray
which is by nature wrapped up in it, is in fellowship with the light,
and by its innate capacity draws to itself that which is akin to it, so
was it needful that a certain affinity with the Divine should be mingled
with the nature of man, in order that by means of this correspondence it
might aim at that which was native to it. It is thus even with the
nature of the unreasoning creatures, whose lot is cast in water or <span
id="page_479">p. 479</span> <span id="xi.ii.vii-Page_479"></span>in air;
each of them has an organization adapted to its kind of life, so that by
a peculiar formation of the body, to the one of them the air, to the
other the water, is its proper and congenial element. Thus, then, it was
needful for man, born for the enjoyment of Divine good, to have
something in his nature akin to that in which he is to participate. For
this end he has been furnished with life, with thought, with skill, and
with all the excellences that we attribute to God, in order that by each
of them he might have his desire set upon that which is not strange to
him. Since, then, one of the excellences connected with the Divine
nature is also eternal existence, it was altogether needful that the
equipment of our nature should not be without the further gift of this
attribute, but should have in itself the immortal, that by its inherent
faculty it might both recognize what is above it, and be possessed with
a desire for the divine and eternal life <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1954](#fn_1952.md) . In truth this has been shown in
the comprehensive utterance of one expression, in the description of the
cosmogony, where it is said that man was made “in the image of
God” <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1955](#fn_1953.md) . For in this likeness,
implied in the word image, there is a summary of all things that
characterize Deity; and whatever else Moses relates, in a style more in
the way of history, of these matters, placing doctrines before us in the
form of a story, is connected with the same instruction. For that
Paradise of his, with its peculiar fruits, the eating of which did not
afford to them who tasted thereof satisfaction of the appetite, but
knowledge and eternity of life, is in entire agreement with what has
been previously considered with regard to man, in the view that our
nature at its beginnings was good, and in the midst of good. But,
perhaps, what has been said will be contradicted by one who looks only
to the present condition of things, and thinks to convict our statement
of untruthfulness, inasmuch as man is seen no longer under those
primeval circumstances, but under almost entirely opposite ones. “Where
is the divine resemblance in the soul? Where the body’s freedom from
suffering? Where the eternity of life? Man is of brief existence,
subject to passions, liable to decay, and ready both in body and mind
for every form of suffering.” By these and the like assertions, and by
directing the attack against human nature, the opponent will think that
he upsets the account that has been offered respecting man. But to
secure that our argument may not have to be diverted from its course at
any future stage, we will briefly discuss these points. That the life of
man is at present subject to abnormal conditions is no proof that man
was not created in the midst of good. For since man is the work of God,
Who through His goodness brought this creature into being, no one could
reasonably suspect that he, of whose constitution goodness is the cause,
was created by his Maker in the midst of evil. But there is another
reason for our present circumstances being what they are, and for our
being destitute of the primitive surroundings: and yet again the
starting-point of our answer to this argument against us is not beyond
and outside the assent of our opponents. For He who made man for the
participation of His own peculiar good, and incorporated in him the
instincts for all that was excellent, in order that his desire might be
carried forward by a corresponding movement in each case to its like,
would never have deprived him of that most excellent and precious of all
goods; I mean the gift implied in being his own master, and having a
free will. For if necessity in any way was the master of the life of
man, the “image” would have been falsified in that particular part, by
being estranged owing to this unlikeness to its archetype. How can that
nature which is under a yoke and bondage to any kind of necessity be
called an image of a Master Being? Was it not, then, most right that
that which is in every detail made like the Divine should possess in its
nature a self-ruling and independent principle, such as to enable the
participation of good to be the reward of its virtue? Whence, then,
comes it, you will ask, that he who had been distinguished throughout
with most excellent endowments exchanged these good things for the
worse? The reason of this also is plain. No growth of evil had its
beginning in the Divine will. Vice would have been blameless were it
inscribed with the name of God as its maker and father. But the evil is,
in some way or other, engendered <span
id="fr_1954"></span>[1956](#fn_1954.md) from within, springing up in the
will at that moment when there is a retrocession of the soul from the
beautiful <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1957](#fn_1955.md) . For as sight is
an activity of nature, and blindness a deprivation of that natural
operation, such is the kind of opposition between virtue and vice. It
is, in fact, not possible to form any other notion of the origin of vice
than as the absence of virtue. For as when the light has been removed
the darkness supervenes, but as long as it is present there is <span
id="page_480">p. 480</span> <span id="xi.ii.vii-Page_480"></span>no
darkness, so, as long as the good is present in the nature, vice is a
thing that has no inherent existence; while the departure of the better
state becomes the origin of its opposite. Since then, this is the
peculiarity of the possession of a free will, that it chooses as it
likes the thing that pleases it, you will find that it is not God Who is
the author of the present evils, seeing that He has ordered your nature
so as to be its own master and free; but rather the recklessness that
makes choice of the worse in preference to the better.
