<span id="ix.ii.ii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> seeing that Paradise is the
home of living spirits, and will not admit those who are dead in sin,
and that we on the other hand are fleshly, subject to death, and sold
under sin <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1430](#fn_1428.md) , how is it
possible that one who is a subject of death’s empire should ever dwell
in this land where all is life? What method of release from this
jurisdiction can be devised? Here too the Gospel teaching is abundantly
sufficient. We hear our Lord saying to Nicodemus, “That which is born of
the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1431](#fn_1429.md) .” We know too that the flesh is
subject to death because of sin, but the Spirit of God is both
incorruptible, and life-giving, and deathless. As at our physical birth
there comes into the world with us a potentiality of being again turned
to dust, plainly the Spirit also imparts a life-giving potentiality to
the children begotten by Himself. What lesson, then, results from these
remarks? This: that we should wean ourselves from this life in the
flesh, which has an inevitable follower, death; and that we should
search for a manner of life which does not bring death in its train. Now
the life of Virginity is such a life. We will add a few other things to
show how true this is. Every one knows that the propagation of mortal
frames is the work which the intercourse of the sexes has to do; whereas
for those who are joined to the Spirit, life and immortality instead of
children are produced by this latter intercourse; and the words of the
Apostle beautifully suit their case, for the joyful mother of such
children as these “shall be saved in child-bearing <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1432](#fn_1430.md) ;” as the Psalmist in his divine
songs thankfully cries, “He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and
to be a joyful mother of children <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1433](#fn_1431.md) .” Truly a joyful mother is the
virgin mother who by the operation of the Spirit conceives the deathless
children, and who is called by the Prophet barren because of her modesty
only. This life, then, which is stronger than the power of death, is, to
those who think, the preferable one. The physical bringing of children
into the world—I speak without wishing to offend—is as much a
starting-point of death as of life; because from the moment of birth the
process of dying commences. But those who by virginity have desisted
from this process have drawn within themselves the boundary line of
death, and by their own deed have checked his advance; they have made
themselves, in fact, a frontier between life and death, and a barrier
too, which thwarts him. If, then, death cannot pass beyond virginity,
but finds his power checked and shattered there, it is demonstrated that
virginity is a stronger thing than death; and that body is rightly named
undying which does not lend its service to a dying world, nor brook to
become the instrument of a succession of dying creatures. In such a body
the long unbroken career of decay and death, which has intervened
between <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1434](#fn_1432.md) the first man and the
lives of virginity which have been led, is interrupted. It could not be
indeed that death should cease working as long as the human race by
marriage was working too; he walked the path of life with all preceding
generations; he started with every new-born child and accompanied it to
the end: but he found in virginity a barrier, to pass which was an
impossible feat. Just as, in the age of Mary the mother of God, he who
had reigned from Adam to her time found, when he came to her and dashed
his forces against the fruit of her virginity as against a <span
id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.xiv-Page_360"></span>rock, that he was shattered to pieces
upon her, so in every soul which passes through this life in the flesh
under the protection of virginity, the strength of death is in a manner
broken and annulled, for he does not find the places upon which he may
fix his sting. If you do not throw into the fire wood, or straw, or
grass, or something that it can consume, it has not the force to last by
itself; so the power of death cannot go on working, if marriage does not
supply it with material and prepare victims for this executioner. If you
have any doubts left, consider the actual names of those afflictions
which death brings upon mankind, and which were detailed in the first
part of this discourse. Whence do they get their meaning? “Widowhood,”
“orphanhood,” “loss of children,” could they be a subject for grief, if
marriage did not precede? Nay, all the dearly-prized blisses, and
transports, and comforts of marriage end in these agonies of grief. The
hilt of a sword is smooth and handy, and polished and glittering
outside; it seems to grow to the outline of the hand <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1435](#fn_1433.md) ; but the other part is steel and
the instrument of death, formidable to look at, more formidable still to
come across. Such a thing is marriage. It offers for the grasp of the
senses a smooth surface of delights, like a hilt of rare polish and
beautiful workmanship; but when a man has taken it up and has got it
into his hands, he finds the pain that has been wedded to it is in his
hands as well; and it becomes to him the worker of mourning and of loss.
It is marriage that has the heartrending spectacles to show of children
left desolate in the tenderness of their years, a mere prey to the
powerful, yet smiling often at their misfortune from ignorance of coming
woes. What is the cause of widowhood but marriage? And retirement from
this would bring with it an immunity from the whole burden of these sad
taxes on our hearts. Can we expect it otherwise? When the verdict that
was pronounced on the delinquents in the beginning is annulled, then too
the mothers’ “sorrows <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1436](#fn_1434.md) ” are
no longer “multiplied,” nor does “sorrow” herald the births of men; then
all calamity has been removed from life and “tears wiped from off all
faces <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1437](#fn_1435.md) ;” conception is no
more an iniquity, nor child-bearing a sin; and births shall be no more
“of bloods,” or “of the will of man,” or “of the will of the flesh <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1438](#fn_1436.md) ”, but of God alone. This is always
happening whenever any one in a lively heart conceives all the integrity
of the Spirit, and brings forth wisdom and righteousness, and
sanctification and redemption too. It is possible for any one to be the
mother of such a son; as our Lord says, “He that doeth my will is my
brother, my sister, and my mother <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1439](#fn_1437.md) .” What room is there for death in
such parturitions? Indeed in them death is swallowed up by life. In
fact, the Life of Virginity seems to be an actual representation of the
blessedness in the world to come, showing as it does in itself so many
signs of the presence of those expected blessings which are reserved for
us there. That the truth of this statement may be perceived, we will
verify it thus. It is so, first, because a man who has thus died once
for all to sin lives for the future to God; he brings forth no more
fruit unto death; and having so far as in him lies made an end <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1440](#fn_1438.md) of this life within him according
to the flesh, he awaits thenceforth the expected blessing of the
manifestation <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1441](#fn_1439.md) of the great
God, refraining from putting any distance between himself and this
coming of God by an intervening posterity: secondly, because he enjoys
even in this present life a certain exquisite glory of all the blessed
results of our resurrection. For our Lord has announced that the life
after our resurrection shall be as that of the angels. Now the
peculiarity of the angelic nature is that they are strangers to
marriage; therefore the blessing of this promise has been already
received by him who has not only mingled his own glory with the halo of
the Saints, but also by the stainlessness of his life has so imitated
the purity of these incorporeal beings. If virginity then can win us
favours such as these, what words are fit to express the admiration of
so great a grace? What other gift of the soul can be found so great and
precious as not to suffer by comparison with this perfection?
