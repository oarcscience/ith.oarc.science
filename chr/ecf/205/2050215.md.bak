id="x.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>On the Soul and the Resurrection.</span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="x.iii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p3.1"></span>Basil</span>, great amongst the saints, had
departed from this life to God; and the impulse to mourn for him was
shared by all the churches. But his sister the Teacher was still living;
and so I journeyed to her <span id="fr_1745"></span>[1747](#fn_1745.md) ,
yearning for an interchange of sympathy over the loss of her brother. My
soul was right sorrow-stricken by this grievous blow, and I sought for
one who could feel it equally, to mingle my tears with. But when we were
in each other’s presence the sight of the Teacher awakened all my pain;
for she too was lying in a state of prostration even unto death. Well,
she gave in to me for a little while, like a skilful driver, in the
ungovernable violence of my grief; and then she tried to check me by
speaking, and to correct with the curb of her reasonings the disorder of
my soul. She quoted the Apostle’s words about the duty of not being
“grieved for them that sleep”; because only “men without hope” have such
feelings. With a heart still fermenting with my pain, I asked—

<span id="x.iii.ii-p5"></span> <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[1748](#fn_1746.md) How can that ever be practised by
mankind? There is such an instinctive and deep-seated abhorrence of
death in all! Those who look on a death-bed can hardly bear the sight;
and those whom death approaches recoil from him all they can. Why, even
the law that controls us puts death highest on the list of crimes, and
highest on the list of punishments. By what device, then, can we bring
ourselves to regard as nothing a departure from life even in the case of
a stranger, not to mention that of relations, when so be they cease to
live? We see before us the whole course of human life aiming at this one
thing, viz. how we may continue in this life; indeed it is for this that
houses have been invented by us to live in; in order that our bodies may
not be prostrated in their environment <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[1749](#fn_1747.md) by cold or heat. Agriculture,
again, what is it but the providing of our sustenance? In fact all
thought about how we are to go on living is occasioned by the fear of
dying. Why is medicine so honoured amongst men? Because it is thought to
carry on the combat with death to a certain extent by its methods. Why
do we have corslets, and long shields, and greaves, and helmets, and all
the defensive armour, and inclosures of fortifications, and iron-barred
gates, except that we fear to die? Death then being naturally so
terrible to us, how can it be easy for a survivor to obey this command
to remain unmoved over friends departed?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p8"></span>Why, what is the especial pain you feel,
asked the Teacher, in the mere necessity itself of dying? This common
talk of unthinking persons is no sufficient accusation.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p9"></span>What! is there no occasion for grieving, I
replied to her, when we see one who so lately lived and spoke becoming
all of a sudden lifeless and motionless, with the sense of every bodily
organ extinct, with no sight or hearing in operation, or any other
faculty of apprehension that sense possesses; and if you apply <span
id="page_431">p. 431</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_431"></span>fire or
steel to him, even if you were to plunge a sword into the body, or cast
it to the beasts of prey, or if you bury it beneath a mound, that dead
man is alike unmoved at any treatment? Seeing, then, that this change is
observed in all these ways, and that principle of life, whatever it
might be, disappears all at once out of sight, as the flame of an
extinguished lamp which burnt on it the moment before neither remains
upon the wick nor passes to some other place, but completely disappears,
how can such a change be borne without emotion by one who has no clear
ground to rest upon? We *hear* the departure of the spirit, we *see* the
shell that is left; but of the part that has been separated we are
ignorant, both as to its nature, and as to the place whither it has
fled; for neither earth, nor air, nor water, nor any other element can
show as residing within itself this force that has left the body, at
whose withdrawal a corpse only remains, ready for dissolution.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p10"></span>Whilst I was thus enlarging on the
subject, the Teacher signed to me with her hand <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[1750](#fn_1748.md) , and said: Surely what alarms and
disturbs your mind is not the thought that the soul, instead of lasting
for ever, ceases with the body’s dissolution!

<span id="x.iii.ii-p12"></span>I answered rather audaciously, and
without due consideration of what I said, for my passionate grief had
not yet given me back my judgment. In fact, I said that the Divine
utterances seemed to me like mere commands compelling us to believe that
the soul lasts for ever; not, however, that we were led by them to this
belief by any reasoning. Our mind within us appears slavishly to accept
the opinion enforced, but not to acquiesce with a spontaneous impulse.
Hence our sorrow over the departed is all the more grievous; we do not
exactly know whether this vivifying principle is anything by itself;
where it is, or how it is; whether, in fact, it exists in any way at all
anywhere. This uncertainty <span id="fr_1749"></span>[1751](#fn_1749.md)
about the real state of the case balances the opinions on either side;
many adopt the one view, many the other; and indeed there are certain
persons, of no small philosophical reputation amongst the Greeks, who
have held and maintained this which I have just said.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p14"></span>Away, she cried, with that pagan
nonsense! For therein the inventor of lies fabricates false theories
only to harm the Truth. Observe this, and nothing else; that such a view
about the soul amounts to nothing less than the abandoning of virtue,
and seeking the pleasure of the moment only; the life of eternity, by
which alone virtue claims the advantage, must be despaired of.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p15"></span>And pray how, I asked, are we to get a
firm and unmovable belief in the soul’s continuance? I, too, am sensible
of the fact that human life will be bereft of the most beautiful
ornament that life has to give, I mean virtue, unless an undoubting
confidence with regard to this be established within us. What, indeed,
has virtue to stand upon in the case of those persons who conceive of
this present life as the limit of their existence, and hope for nothing
beyond?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p16"></span>Well, replied the Teacher, we must seek
where we may get a beginning for our discussion upon this point; and if
you please, let the defence of the opposing views be undertaken by
yourself; for I see that your mind is a little inclined to accept such a
brief. Then, after the conflicting belief has been stated, we shall be
able to look for the truth.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p17"></span>When she made this request, and I had
deprecated the suspicion that I was making the objections in real
earnest, instead of only wishing to get a firm ground for the belief
about the soul by calling into court <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1752](#fn_1750.md) first what is aimed against this
view, I began—

<span id="x.iii.ii-p19"></span>Would not the defenders of the opposite
belief say this: that the body, being composite, must necessarily be
resolved into that of which it is composed? And when the coalition of
elements in the body ceases, each of those elements naturally gravitates
towards its kindred element with the irresistible bias of like to like;
the heat in us will thus unite with heat, the earthy with the solid, and
each of the other elements also will pass towards its like. Where, then,
will the soul be after that? If one affirm that it is in those elements,
one will be obliged to admit that it is identical with them, for this
fusion could not possibly take place between two things of different
natures. But this being granted, the soul must necessarily be viewed as
a complex thing, fused as it is with qualities so opposite. But the
complex is not simple, but must be classed with the composite, and the
composite is necessarily dissoluble; and <span id="page_432">p.
432</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_432"></span>dissolution means the
destruction of the compound; and the destructible is not immortal, else
the flesh itself, resolvable as it is into its constituent elements,
might so be called immortal. If, on the other hand, the soul is
something other than these elements, where can our reason suggest a
place for it to be, when it is thus, by virtue of its alien nature, not
to be discovered in those elements, and there is no other place in the
world, either, where it may continue, in harmony with its own peculiar
character, to exist? But, if a thing can be found nowhere, plainly it
has no existence.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p20"></span>The Teacher sighed gently at these words
of mine, and then said; Maybe these were the objections, or such as
these, that the Stoics and Epicureans collected at Athens made in answer
to the Apostle. I hear that Epicurus carried his theories in this very
direction. The framework of things was to his mind a fortuitous <span
id="fr_1751"></span>[1753](#fn_1751.md) and mechanical affair, without a
Providence penetrating its operations; and, as a piece with this, he
thought that human life was like a bubble, existing only as long as the
breath within was held in by the enveloping substance <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[1754](#fn_1752.md) , inasmuch as our body was a mere
membrane, as it were, encompassing a breath; and that on the collapse of
the inflation the imprisoned essence was extinguished. To him the
visible was the limit of existence; he made our senses the only means of
our apprehension of things; he completely closed the eyes of his soul,
and was incapable of seeing anything in the intelligible and immaterial
world, just as a man, who is imprisoned in a cabin whose walls and roof
obstruct the view outside, remains without a glimpse of all the wonders
of the sky. Verily, everything in the universe that is seen to be an
object of sense is as an earthen wall, forming in itself a barrier
between the narrower souls and that intelligible world which is ready
for their contemplation; and it is the earth and water and fire alone
that such behold; whence comes each of these elements, in what and by
what they are encompassed, such souls because of their narrowness cannot
detect. While the sight of a garment suggests to any one the weaver of
it, and the thought of the shipwright comes at the sight of the ship,
and the hand of the builder is brought to the mind of him who sees the
building, these little souls gaze upon the world, but their eyes are
blind to Him whom all this that we see around us makes manifest; and so
they propound their clever and pungent doctrines about the soul’s
evanishment;—body from elements, and elements from body, and, besides,
the impossibility of the soul’s self-existence (if it is not to be one
of these elements, or lodged in one); for if these opponents suppose
that by virtue of the soul not being akin to the elements it is nowhere
after death, they must propound, to begin with, the absence of the soul
from the fleshly life as well, seeing that the body itself is nothing
but a concourse of those elements; and so they must not tell us that the
soul is to be found there either, independently vivifying their
compound. If it is not possible for the soul to exist *after* death,
though the elements do, then, I say, according to this teaching our life
as well is proved to be nothing else but death. But if on the other hand
they do not make the existence of the soul now in the body a question
for doubt, how can they maintain its evanishment when the body is
resolved into its elements? Then, secondly, they must employ an equal
audacity against the God in this Nature too. For how can they assert
that the intelligible and immaterial Unseen can be dissolved and
diffused into the wet and the soft, as also into the hot and the dry,
and so hold together the universe in existence through being, though not
of a kindred nature with the things which it penetrates, yet not thereby
incapable of so penetrating them? Let them, therefore, remove from their
system the very Deity Who upholds the world.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p23"></span>That is the very point, I said, upon
which our adversaries cannot fail to have doubts; viz. that all things
depend on God and are encompassed by Him, or, that there is any divinity
at all transcending the physical world.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p24"></span>It would be more fitting, she cried, to
be silent about such doubts, and not to deign to make any answer to such
foolish and wicked propositions; for there is a Divine precept
forbidding us to answer a fool in his folly; and he must be a fool, as
the Prophet declares, who says that there is no God. But since one needs
must speak, I will urge upon you an argument which is not mine nor that
of any human being (for it would then be of small value, whosoever spoke
it), but an argument which the whole Creation enunciates by the medium
of its wonders to the audience <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[1755](#fn_1753.md) of the eye, with a <span
id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_433"></span>skilful
and artistic utterance that reaches the heart. The Creation proclaims
outright the Creator; for the very heavens, as the Prophet says, declare
the glory of God with their unutterable words. We see the universal
harmony in the wondrous sky and on the wondrous earth; how elements
essentially opposed to each other are all woven together in an ineffable
union to serve one common end, each contributing its particular force to
maintain the whole; how the unmingling and mutually repellent do not fly
apart from each other by virtue of their peculiarities, any more than
they are destroyed, when compounded, by such contrariety; how those
elements which are naturally buoyant move downwards, the heat of the
sun, for instance, descending in the rays, while the bodies which
possess weight are lifted by becoming rarefied in vapour, so that water
contrary to its nature ascends, being conveyed through the air to the
upper regions; how too that fire of the firmament so penetrates the
earth that even its abysses feel the heat; how the moisture of the rain
infused into the soil generates, one though it be by nature, myriads of
differing germs, and animates in due proportion each subject of its
influence; how very swiftly the polar sphere revolves, how the orbits
within it move the contrary way, with all the eclipses, and
conjunctions, and measured intervals <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1756](#fn_1754.md) of the planets. We see all this
with the piercing eyes of mind, nor can we fail to be taught by means of
such a spectacle that a Divine power, working with skill and method, is
manifesting itself in this actual world, and, penetrating each portion,
combines those portions with the whole and completes the whole by the
portions, and encompasses the universe with a single all-controlling
force, self-centred and self-contained, never ceasing from its motion,
yet never altering the position which it holds.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p27"></span>And pray how, I asked, does this belief
in the existence of God prove along with it the existence of the human
soul? For God, surely, is not the same thing as the soul, so that, if
the one were believed in, the other must necessarily be believed in.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p28"></span>She replied: It has been said by wise men
that man is a little world <span id="fr_1755"></span>[1757](#fn_1755.md) in
himself and contains all the elements which go to complete the universe.
If this view is a true one (and so it seems), we perhaps shall need no
other ally than it to establish the truth of our conception of the soul.
And our conception of it is this; that it exists, with a rare and
peculiar nature of its own, independently of the body with its gross
texture. We get our exact knowledge of this outer world from the
apprehension of our senses, and these sensational operations themselves
lead us on to the understanding of the super-sensual world of fact and
thought, and our eye thus becomes the interpreter of that almighty
wisdom which is visible in the universe, and points in itself to the
Being Who encompasses it. Just so, when we look to our inner world, we
find no slight grounds there also, in the known, for conjecturing the
unknown; and the unknown there also is that which, being the object of
thought and not of sight, eludes the grasp of sense.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p30"></span>I rejoined, Nay, it may be very possible
to infer a wisdom transcending the universe from the skilful and
artistic designs observable in this harmonized fabric of physical
nature; but, as regards the soul, what knowledge is possible to those
who would trace, from any indications the body has to give, the unknown
through the known?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p31"></span>Most certainly, the Virgin replied, the
soul herself, to those who wish to follow the wise proverb and know
themselves, is a competent <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1758](#fn_1756.md)
instructress; of the fact, I mean, that she is an immaterial and
spiritual thing, working and moving in a way corresponding to her
peculiar nature, and evincing these peculiar emotions through the organs
of the body. For this bodily organization exists the same even in those
who have just been reduced by death to the state of corpses, but it
remains without motion or action because the force of the soul is no
longer in it. It moves only when there is sensation in the organs, and
not only that, but the mental force by means of that sensation
penetrates with its own impulses and moves whither it will all those
organs of sensation.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p33"></span>What then, I asked, is the soul? Perhaps
there may be some possible means of delineating its nature; so that we
may have some comprehension of this subject, in the way of a sketch.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p34"></span>Its definition, the Teacher replied, has
been attempted in different ways by different writers, each according to
his own bent; but the following is our opinion about it. The soul is an
essence created, and living, and intellectual, transmitting from itself
to an organized and sentient body the power of living and of grasping
objects of sense, as long as a natural constitution capable of this
holds together.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p35"></span>Saying this she pointed to the
physician <span id="fr_1757"></span>[1759](#fn_1757.md) <span
id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_434"></span>who was
sitting to watch her state, and said: There is a proof of what I say
close by us. How, I ask, does this man, by putting his fingers to feel
the pulse, hear in a manner, through this sense of touch, Nature calling
loudly to him and telling him of her peculiar pain; in fact, that the
disease in the body is an inflammatory one <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1760](#fn_1758.md) , and that the malady originates in
this or that internal organ; and that there is such and such a degree of
fever? How too is he taught by the agency of the eye other facts of this
kind, when he looks to see the posture of the patient and watches the
wasting of the flesh? As, too, the state of the complexion, pale
somewhat and bilious, and the gaze of the eyes, as is the case with
those in pain, involuntarily inclining to sadness, indicate the internal
condition, so the ear gives information of the like, ascertaining the
nature of the malady by the shortness of the breathing and by the groan
that comes with it. One might say that even the sense of smell in the
expert is not incapable of detecting the kind of disorder, but that it
notices the secret suffering of the vitals in the particular quality of
the breath. Could this be so if there were not a certain force of
intelligence present in each organ of the senses? What would our hand
have taught us of itself, without thought conducting it from feeling to
understanding the subject before it? What would the ear, as separate
from mind, or the eye or the nostril or any other organ have helped
towards the settling of the question, all by themselves? Verily, it is
most true what one of heathen culture is recorded to have said, that it
is the mind that sees and the mind that hears <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1761](#fn_1759.md) . Else, if you will not allow this
to be true, you must tell me why, when you look at the sun, as you have
been trained by your instructor to look at him, you assert that he is
not in the breadth of his disc of the size he appears to the many, but
that he exceeds by many times the measure of the entire earth. Do you
not confidently maintain that it is so, because you have arrived by
reasoning through phenomena at the conception of such and such a
movement, of such distances of time and space, of such causes of
eclipse? And when you look at the waning and waxing moon you are taught
other truths by the visible figure of that heavenly body, viz. that it
is in itself devoid of light, and that it revolves in the circle nearest
to the earth, and that it is lit by light from the sun; just as is the
case with mirrors, which, receiving the sun upon them, do not reflect
rays of their own, but those of the sun, whose light is given back from
their smooth flashing surface. Those who see this, but do not examine
it, think that the light comes from the moon herself. But that this is
not the case is proved by this; that when she is diametrically facing
the sun she has the whole of the disc that looks our way illuminated;
but, as she traverses her own circle of revolution quicker from moving
in a narrower space, she herself has completed this more than twelve
times before the sun has once travelled round his; whence it happens
that her substance is not always covered with light. For her position
facing him is not maintained in the frequency of her revolutions; but,
while this position causes the whole side of the moon which looks to us
to be illumined, directly she moves sideways her hemisphere which is
turned to us necessarily becomes partially shadowed, and only that which
is turned to him meets his embracing rays; the brightness, in fact,
keeps on retiring from that which can no longer see the sun to that
which still sees him, until she passes right across the sun’s disc and
receives his rays upon her hinder part; and then the fact of her being
in herself totally devoid of light and splendour causes the side turned
to us to be invisible while the further hemisphere is all in light; and
this is called the completion <span id="fr_1760"></span>[1762](#fn_1760.md)
of her waning. But when again, in her own revolution, she has passed the
sun and she is transverse to his rays, the side which was dark just
before begins to shine a little, for the rays move from the illumined
part to that so lately invisible. You see what the eye does teach; and
yet it would never of itself have afforded this insight, without
something that looks through the eyes and uses the data of the senses as
mere guides to penetrate from the apparent to the unseen. It is needless
to add the methods of geometry that lead us step by step through visible
delineations to truths that lie out of sight, and countless other
instances which all prove that apprehension is the work of an
intellectual essence deeply seated in our nature, acting through the
operation of our bodily senses.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p40"></span>But what, I asked, if, insisting on the
great <span id="page_435">p. 435</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_435"></span>differences which, in spite of a certain
quality of matter shared alike by all elements in their visible form,
exist between each particular kind of matter (motion, for instance, is
not the same in all, some moving up, some down; nor form, nor quality
either), some one were to say that there was in the same manner
incorporated in, and belonging to, these elements a certain force <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[1763](#fn_1761.md) as well which effects these
intellectual insights and operations by a purely natural effort of their
own (such effects, for instance, as we often see produced by the
mechanists, in whose hands matter, combined according to the rules of
Art, thereby imitates Nature, exhibiting resemblance not in figure alone
but even in motion, so that when the piece of mechanism sounds in its
resonant part it mimics a human voice, without, however, our being able
to perceive anywhere any mental force working out the particular figure,
character, sound, and movement); suppose, I say, we were to affirm that
all this was produced as well in the organic machine of our natural
bodies, without any intermixture of a special thinking substance, but
owing simply to an inherent motive power of the elements within us
accomplishing <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1764](#fn_1762.md) by itself these
operations—to nothing else, in fact, but an impulsive movement working
for the cognition of the object before us; would not then the fact stand
proved of the absolute nonexistence <span
id="fr_1763"></span>[1765](#fn_1763.md) of that intellectual and impalpable
Being, the soul, which you talk of?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p44"></span>Your instance, she replied, and your
reasoning upon it, though belonging to the counter-argument, may both of
them be made allies of our statement, and will contribute not a little
to the confirmation of its truth.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p45"></span>Why, how can you say that?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p46"></span>Because, you see, so to understand,
manipulate, and dispose the soulless matter, that the art which is
stored away in such mechanisms becomes almost like a soul to this
material, in all the various ways in which it mocks movement, and
figure, and voice, and so on, may be turned into a proof of there being
something in man whereby he shows an innate fitness to think out within
himself, through the contemplative and inventive faculties, such
thoughts, and having prepared such mechanisms in theory, to put them
into practice by manual skill, and exhibit in matter the product of his
mind. First, for instance, he saw, by dint of thinking, that to produce
any sound there is need of some wind; and then, with a view to produce
wind in the mechanism, he previously ascertained by a course of
reasoning and close observation of the nature of elements, that there is
no vacuum at all in the world, but that the lighter is to be considered
a vacuum only by comparison with the heavier; seeing that the air
itself, taken as a separate subsistence, is crowded quite full. It is by
an abuse of language that a jar is said to be “empty”; for when it is
empty of any liquid it is none the less, even in this state, full, in
the eyes of the experienced. A proof of this is that a jar when put into
a pool of water is not immediately filled, but at first floats on the
surface, because the air it contains helps to buoy up its rounded sides;
till at last the hand of the drawer of the water forces it down to the
bottom, and, when there, it takes in water by its neck; during which
process it is shown not to have been empty even before the water came;
for there is the spectacle of a sort of combat going on in the neck
between the two elements, the water being forced by its weight into the
interior, and therefore streaming in; the imprisoned air on the other
hand being straitened for room by the gush of the water along the neck,
and so rushing in the contrary direction; thus the water is checked by
the strong current of air, and gurgles and bubbles against it. Men
observed this, and devised in accordance with this property of the two
elements a way of introducing air to work their mechanism <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1766](#fn_1764.md) . They made a kind of cavity of
some hard stuff, and prevented the air in it from escaping in any
direction; and then introduced water into this cavity through its mouth,
apportioning the quantity of water according to requirement; next they
allowed an exit in the opposite direction to the air, so that it passed
into a pipe placed ready to hand, and in so doing, being violently
constrained by the water, became a blast; and this, playing on the
structure of the pipe, produced a note. Is it not clearly proved by such
visible results that there is a mind of some kind in man, something
other than that which is visible, which, by virtue of an invisible
thinking nature of its own, first prepares by inward invention such
devices, and then, when they have been so matured, brings them to the
light and exhibits them in the subservient matter? For if <span
id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_436"></span>it were
possible to ascribe such wonders, as the theory of our opponents does,
to the actual constitution of the elements, we should have these
mechanisms building themselves spontaneously; the bronze would not wait
for the artist, to be made into the likeness of a man, but would become
such by an innate force; the air would not require the pipe, to make a
note, but would sound spontaneously by its own fortuitous flux and
motion; and the jet of the water upwards would not be, as it now is, the
result of an artificial pressure forcing it to move in an unnatural
direction, but the water would rise into the mechanism of its own
accord, finding in that direction a natural channel. But if none of
these results are produced spontaneously by elemental force, but, on the
contrary, each element is employed at will by artifice; and if artifice
is a kind of movement and activity of mind, will not the very
consequences of what has been urged by way of objection show us Mind as
something other than the thing perceived?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p48"></span>That the thing perceived, I replied, is
not the same as the thing not perceived, I grant; but I do not discover
any answer to our question in such a statement; it is not yet clear to
me what we are to think that thing not-perceived to be; all I have been
shown by your argument is that it is not anything material; and I do not
yet know the fitting name for it. I wanted especially to know what it
is, not what it is not.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p49"></span>We do learn, she replied, much about many
things by this very same method, inasmuch as, in the very act of saying
a thing is “not so and so,” we by implication interpret the very nature
of the thing in question <span id="fr_1765"></span>[1767](#fn_1765.md) .
For instance, when we say a “guileless,” we indicate a good man; when we
say “unmanly,” we have expressed that a man is a coward; and it is
possible to suggest a great many things in like fashion, wherein we
either convey the idea of goodness by the negation of badness <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1768](#fn_1766.md) , or *vice versâ*. Well, then, if
one thinks so with regard to the matter now before us, one will not fail
to gain a proper conception of it. The question is,—What are we to think
of Mind in its very essence? Now granted that the inquirer has had his
doubts set at rest as to the existence of the thing in question, owing
to the activities which it displays to us, and only wants to know what
it is, he will have adequately discovered it by being told that it is
not that which our senses perceive, neither a colour, nor a form, nor a
hardness, nor a weight, nor a quantity, nor a cubic dimension, nor a
point, nor anything else perceptible in matter; supposing, that
is, <span id="fr_1767"></span>[1769](#fn_1767.md) that there does exist a
something beyond all these.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p53"></span>Here I interrupted her discourse: If you
leave all these out of the account I do not see how you can possibly
avoid cancelling along with them the very thing which you are in search
of. I cannot at present conceive to what, as apart from these, the
perceptive activity is to cling. For on all occasions in investigating
with the scrutinizing intellect the contents of the world, we must, so
far as we put our hand <span id="fr_1768"></span>[1770](#fn_1768.md) at all
on what we are seeking, inevitably touch, as blind men feeling along the
walls for the door, some one of those things aforesaid; we must come on
colour, or form, or quantity, or something else on your list; and when
it comes to saying that the thing is none of them, our feebleness of
mind induces us to suppose that it does not exist at all.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p55"></span>Shame on such absurdity! said she,
indignantly interrupting. A fine conclusion this narrow-minded,
grovelling view of the world brings us to! If all that is not cognizable
by sense is to be wiped out of existence, the all-embracing Power that
presides over things is admitted by this same assertion not to be; once
a man has been told about the non-material and invisible nature of the
Deity, he must perforce with such a premise reckon it as absolutely
non-existent. If, on the other hand, the absence of such characteristics
in His case does not constitute any limitation of His existence, how can
the Mind of man be squeezed out of existence along with this withdrawal
one by one of each property of matter?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p56"></span>Well, then, I retorted, we only exchange
one paradox for another by arguing in this way; for our reason will be
reduced to the conclusion that the Deity and the Mind of man are
identical, if it be true that neither can be thought of, except by the
withdrawal of all the data of sense.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p57"></span>Say not so, she replied; to talk so also
is blasphemous. Rather, as the Scripture tells you, say that the one is
*like* the other. For that which is “made in the image” of the Deity
necessarily possesses a likeness to its prototype in every respect; it
resembles it in being intellectual, immaterial, unconnected <span
id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_437"></span>with any
notion of weight <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1771](#fn_1769.md) , and in
eluding any measurement of its dimensions <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1772](#fn_1770.md) ; yet as regards its own peculiar
nature it is something different from that other. Indeed, it would be no
longer an “image,” if it were altogether identical with that other;
but <span id="fr_1771"></span>[1773](#fn_1771.md) where we have *A* in that
uncreate prototype we have *a* in the image; just as in a minute
particle of glass, when it happens to face the light, the complete disc
of the sun is often to be seen, not represented thereon in proportion to
its proper size, but so far as the minuteness of the particle admits of
its being represented at all. Thus do the reflections of those ineffable
qualities of Deity shine forth within the narrow limits of our nature;
and so our reason, following the leading of these reflections, will not
miss grasping the Mind in its essence by clearing away from the question
all corporeal qualities; nor on the other hand will it bring the
pure <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1774](#fn_1772.md) and infinite Existence
to the level of that which is perishable and little; it will regard this
essence of the Mind as an object of thought only, since it is the
“image” of an Existence which is such; but it will not pronounce this
image to be identical with the prototype. Just, then, as we have no
doubts, owing to the display of a Divine mysterious wisdom in the
universe, about a Divine Being and a Divine Power existing in it all
which secures its continuance (though if you required a definition of
that Being you would therein find the Deity completely sundered from
every object in creation, whether of sense or thought, while in these
last, too, natural distinctions are admitted), so, too, there is nothing
strange in the soul’s separate existence as a substance (whatever we may
think that substance to be) being no hindrance to her actual existence,
in spite of the elemental atoms of the world not harmonizing with her in
the definition of her being. In the case of our living bodies, composed
as they are from the blending of these atoms, there is no sort of
communion, as has been just said, on the score of substance, between the
simplicity and invisibility of the soul, and the grossness of those
bodies; but, notwithstanding that, there is not a doubt that there is in
them the soul’s vivifying influence exerted by a law which it is beyond
the human understanding to comprehend <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1775](#fn_1773.md) . Not even then, when those atoms
have again been dissolved <span id="fr_1774"></span>[1776](#fn_1774.md)
into themselves, has that bond of a vivifying influence vanished; but
as, while the framework of the body still holds together, each
individual part is possessed of a soul which penetrates equally every
component member, and one could not call that soul hard and resistent
though blended with the solid, nor humid, or cold, or the reverse,
though it transmits life to all and each of such parts, so, when that
framework is dissolved, and has returned to its kindred elements, there
is nothing against probability that that simple and incomposite essence
which has once for all by some inexplicable law grown with the growth of
the bodily framework should continually remain beside the atoms with
which it has been blended, and should in no way be sundered from a union
once formed. For it does not follow that because the composite is
dissolved the incomposite must be dissolved with it <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1777](#fn_1775.md) .

<span id="x.iii.ii-p66"></span>That those atoms, I rejoined, should
unite and again be separated, and that this constitutes the formation
and dissolution of the body, no one would deny. But we have to consider
this. There are great intervals between these atoms; they differ from
each other, both in position, and also in qualitative distinctions and
peculiarities. When, indeed, these atoms have all converged upon the
given subject, it is reasonable that that intelligent and undimensional
essence which we call the soul should cohere with that which is so
united; but once these atoms are separated from each other, and have
gone whither their nature impels them, what is to become of the soul
when her vessel <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1778](#fn_1776.md) is thus
scattered in many directions? As a sailor, when his ship has been
wrecked and gone to pieces, cannot float upon all the pieces at
once <span id="fr_1777"></span>[1779](#fn_1777.md) which have been
scattered this way <span id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_438"></span>and that over the surface of the sea (for
he seizes any bit that comes to hand, and lets all the rest drift away),
in the same way the soul, being by nature incapable of dissolution along
with the atoms, will, if she finds it hard to be parted from the body
altogether, cling to some one of them; and if we take this view,
consistency will no more allow us to regard her as immortal for living
in one atom than as mortal for not living in a number of them.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p69"></span>But the intelligent and undimensional,
she replied, is neither contracted nor diffused <span
id="fr_1778"></span>[1780](#fn_1778.md) (contraction and diffusion being a
property of body only); but by virtue of a nature which is formless and
bodiless it is present with the body equally in the contraction and in
the diffusion of its atoms, and is no more narrowed by the compression
which attends the uniting of the atoms than it is abandoned by them when
they wander off to their kindred, however wide the interval is held to
be which we observe between alien atoms. For instance, there is a great
difference between the buoyant and light as contrasted with the heavy
and solid; between the hot as contrasted with the cold; between the
humid as contrasted with its opposite; nevertheless it is no strain to
an intelligent essence to be present in each of those elements to which
it has once cohered; this blending with opposites does not split it up.
In locality, in peculiar qualities, these elemental atoms are held to be
far removed from each other; but an undimensional nature finds it no
labour to cling to what is locally divided, seeing that even now it is
possible for the mind at once to contemplate the heavens above us and to
extend its busy scrutiny beyond the horizon, nor is its contemplative
power at all distracted by these excursions into distances so great.
There is nothing, then, to hinder the soul’s presence in the body’s
atoms, whether fused in union or decomposed in dissolution. Just as in
the amalgam of gold and silver a certain methodical force is to be
observed which has fused the metals, and if the one be afterwards
smelted out of the other, the law of this method nevertheless continues
to reside in each, so that while the amalgam is separated this method
does not suffer division along with it (for you cannot make fractions
out of the indivisible), in the same way this intelligent essence of the
soul is observable in the concourse of the atoms, and does not undergo
division when they are dissolved; but it remains with them, and even in
their separation it is co-extensive with them, yet not itself dissevered
nor discounted <span id="fr_1779"></span>[1781](#fn_1779.md) into sections
to accord with the number of the atoms. Such a condition belongs to the
material and spacial world, but that which is intelligent and
undimensional is not liable to the circumstances of space. Therefore the
soul exists in the actual atoms which she has once animated, and there
is no force to tear her away from her cohesion with them. What cause for
melancholy, then, is there herein, that the visible is exchanged for the
invisible; and wherefore is it that your mind has conceived such a
hatred of death?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p72"></span>Upon this I recurred to the definition
which she had previously given of the soul, and I said that to my
thinking her definition had not indicated <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1782](#fn_1780.md) distinctly enough all the powers of
the soul which are a matter of observation. It declares the soul to be
an intellectual essence which imparts to the organic body a force of
life by which the senses operate. Now the soul is not thus operative
only in our scientific and speculative intellect; it does not produce
results in that world only, or employ the organs of sense only for this
their natural work. On the contrary, we observe in our nature many
emotions of desire and many of anger; and both these exist in us as
qualities of our kind, and we see both of them in their manifestations
displaying further many most subtle differences. There are many states,
for instance, which are occasioned by desire; many others which on the
other hand proceed from anger; and none of them are of the body; but
that which is not of the body is plainly intellectual. Now <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1783](#fn_1781.md) our definition exhibits the soul as
something intellectual; so that one of two alternatives, both absurd,
must emerge when we follow out this <span id="page_439">p. 439</span>
<span id="x.iii.ii-Page_439"></span>view to this end; either anger and
desire are both second souls in us, and a plurality of souls must take
the place of the single soul, or the thinking faculty in us cannot be
regarded as a soul either (if *they* are not), the intellectual element
adhering equally to all of them and stamping them all as souls, or else
excluding every one of them equally from the specific qualities of soul.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p78"></span>You are quite justified, she replied, in
raising this question, and it has ere this been discussed by many
elsewhere; namely, what we are to think of the principle of desire and
the principle of anger within us. Are they consubstantial with the soul,
inherent in the soul’s very self from her first organization <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1784](#fn_1782.md) , or are they something different,
accruing to us afterwards? In fact, while all equally allow that these
principles are to be detected in the soul, investigation has not yet
discovered exactly what we are to think of them so as to gain some fixed
belief with regard to them. The generality of men still fluctuate in
their opinions about this, which are as erroneous as they are numerous.
As for ourselves, if the Gentile philosophy, which deals methodically
with all these points, were really adequate for a demonstration, it
would certainly be superfluous to add <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[1785](#fn_1783.md) a discussion on the soul to those
speculations. But while the latter proceeded, on the subject of the
soul, as far in the direction of supposed consequences as the thinker
pleased, we are not entitled to such licence, I mean that of affirming
what we please; we make the Holy Scriptures the rule and the measure of
every tenet; we necessarily fix our eyes upon that, and approve that
alone which may be made to harmonize with the intention of those
writings. We must therefore neglect the Platonic chariot and the pair of
horses of dissimilar forces yoked to it, and their driver, whereby the
philosopher allegorizes these facts about the soul; we must neglect also
all that is said by the philosopher who succeeded him and who followed
out probabilities by rules of art <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1786](#fn_1784.md) , and diligently investigated the
very question now before us, declaring that the soul was mortal <span
id="fr_1785"></span>[1787](#fn_1785.md) by reason of these two principles;
we must neglect all before and since their time, whether they
philosophized in prose or in verse, and we will adopt, as the guide of
our reasoning, the Scripture, which lays it down as an axiom that there
is no excellence in the soul which is not a property as well of the
Divine nature. For he who declares the soul to be God’s likeness asserts
that anything foreign to Him is outside the limits of the soul;
similarity cannot be retained in those qualities which are diverse from
the original. Since, then, nothing of the kind we are considering is
included in the conception of the Divine nature, one would be reasonable
in surmising that such things are not consubstantial with the soul
either. Now to seek to build up our doctrine by rule of dialectic and
the science which draws and destroys conclusions, involves a species of
discussion which we shall ask to be excused from, as being a weak and
questionable way of demonstrating truth. Indeed, it is clear to every
one that that subtle dialectic possesses a force that may be turned both
ways, as well for the overthrow of truth <span
id="fr_1786"></span>[1788](#fn_1786.md) as for the detection of falsehood;
and so we begin to suspect even truth itself when it is advanced in
company with such a kind of artifice, and to think that the very
ingenuity of it is trying to bias our judgment and to upset the truth.
If on the other hand any one will accept a discussion which is in a
naked unsyllogistic form, we will speak upon these points by making our
study of them so far as we can follow the chain <span
id="fr_1787"></span>[1789](#fn_1787.md) of Scriptural tradition. What is
it, then, that we assert? We say that the fact of the reasoning animal
man being capable of understanding and knowing is most surely <span
id="fr_1788"></span>[1790](#fn_1788.md) attested by those outside our
faith; and that this definition would never have sketched our nature so,
if it had viewed anger and desire and all such-like emotions as
consubstantial with that nature. In any other case, one would not give a
definition of the subject in hand by putting a generic instead of a
specific quality; and so, as the principle of desire and the principle
of anger are observed equally in rational and irrational natures, one
could not <span id="page_440">p. 440</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_440"></span>rightly mark the specific quality by means
of this generic one. But how can that which, in defining a nature, is
superfluous and worthy of exclusion be treated as a part of that nature,
and, so, available for falsifying the definition? Every definition of an
essence looks to the specific quality of the subject in hand; and
whatever is outside that speciality is set aside as having nothing to do
with the required definition. Yet, beyond question, these faculties of
anger and desire are allowed to be common to all reasoning and brute
natures; anything common is not identical with that which is peculiar;
it is imperative therefore that we should not range these faculties
amongst those whereby humanity is exclusively meant: but just as one may
perceive the principle <span id="fr_1789"></span>[1791](#fn_1789.md) of
sensation, and that of nutrition and growth in man, and yet not shake
thereby the given definition of his soul (for the quality A being in the
soul does not prevent the quality B being in it too), so, when one
detects in humanity these emotions of anger and desire, one cannot on
that account fairly quarrel with this definition, as if it fell short of
a full indication of man’s nature.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p87"></span>What then, I asked the Teacher, are we to
think about this? For I cannot yet see how we can fitly repudiate
faculties which are actually within us.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p88"></span>You see, she replied, there is a battle
of the reason with them and a struggle to rid the soul of them; and
there are men in whom this struggle has ended in success; it was so with
Moses, as we know; he was superior both to anger and to desire; the
history testifying of him in both respects, that he was meek beyond all
men (and by meekness it indicates the absence of all anger and a mind
quite devoid of resentment), and that he desired none of those things
about which we see the desiring faculty in the generality so active.
This could not have been so, if these faculties were nature, and were
referable to the contents of man’s essence <span
id="fr_1790"></span>[1792](#fn_1790.md) . For it is impossible for one who
has come quite outside of his nature to be in Existence at all. But if
Moses was at one and the same time in Existence and not in these
conditions, then <span id="fr_1791"></span>[1793](#fn_1791.md) it follows
that these conditions are something other than nature and not nature
itself. For if, on the one hand, that is truly nature in which the
essence of the being is found, and, on the other, the removal of these
conditions is in our power, so that their removal not only does no harm,
but is even beneficial to the nature, it is clear that these conditions
are to be numbered amongst externals, and are affections, rather than
the essence, of the nature; for the essence is that thing only which it
is. As for anger, most think it a fermenting of the blood round the
heart; others an eagerness to inflict pain in return for a previous
pain; we would take it to be the impulse to hurt one who has provoked
us. But none of these accounts of it tally with the definition of the
soul. Again, if we were to define what desire is in itself, we should
call it a seeking for that which is wanting, or a longing for
pleasurable enjoyment, or a pain at not possessing that upon which the
heart is set, or a state with regard to some pleasure which there is no
opportunity of enjoying. These and such-like descriptions all indicate
desire, but they have no connection with the definition of the soul. But
it is so with regard to all those other conditions also which we see to
have some relation to the soul, those, I mean, which are mutually
opposed to each other, such as cowardice and courage, pleasure and pain,
fear and contempt, and so on; each of them seems akin to the principle
of desire or to that of anger, while they have a separate definition to
mark their own peculiar nature. Courage and contempt, for instance,
exhibit a certain phase of the irascible impulse; the dispositions
arising from cowardice and fear exhibit on the other hand a diminution
and weakening of that same impulse. Pain, again, draws its material both
from anger and desire. For the impotence of anger, which consists in not
being able to punish one who has first given pain, becomes itself pain;
and the despair of getting objects of desire and the absence of things
upon which the heart is set create in the mind this same sullen state.
Moreover, the opposite to pain, I mean the sensation of pleasure <span
id="fr_1792"></span>[1794](#fn_1792.md) , like pain, divides itself between
anger and desire; for pleasure is the leading motive of them both. All
these conditions, I say, have some relation to the soul, and yet they
are not the soul <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1795](#fn_1793.md) , but only
like warts growing out of the soul’s thinking part, which are reckoned
as parts of it because they adhere to it, and yet are not that actual
thing which the soul is in its essence.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p93"></span>And yet, I rejoined to the virgin, we see
no slight help afforded for improvement to the <span id="page_441">p.
441</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_441"></span>virtuous from all these
conditions. Daniel’s desire was his glory; and Phineas’ anger pleased
the Deity. We have been told, too, that fear is the beginning of wisdom,
and learnt from Paul that salvation is the goal of the “sorrow after a
godly sort.” The Gospel bids us have a contempt for danger; and the “not
being afraid with any amazement” is nothing else but a describing of
courage, and this last is numbered by Wisdom amongst the things that are
good. In all this Scripture shows that such conditions are not to be
considered weaknesses; weaknesses would not have been so employed for
putting virtue into practice.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p94"></span>I think, replied the Teacher, that I am
myself responsible for this confusion arising from different accounts of
the matter; for I did not state it as distinctly as I might have, by
introducing a certain order of consequences for our consideration. Now,
however, some such order shall, as far as it is possible, be devised, so
that our essay may advance in the way of logical sequence and so give no
room for such contradictions. We declare, then, that the speculative,
critical, and world-surveying faculty of the soul is its peculiar
property by virtue of its very nature <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1796](#fn_1794.md) , and that thereby the soul
preserves within itself the image of the divine grace; since our reason
surmises that divinity itself, whatever it may be in its inmost nature,
is manifested in these very things,—universal supervision and the
critical discernment between good and evil. But all those elements of
the soul which lie on the border-land <span
id="fr_1795"></span>[1797](#fn_1795.md) and are capable from their peculiar
nature of inclining to either of two opposites (whose eventual
determination to the good or to the bad depends on the kind of use they
are put to), anger, for instance, and fear, and any other such-like
emotion of the soul divested of which human nature <span
id="fr_1796"></span>[1798](#fn_1796.md) cannot be studied—all these we
reckon as accretions from without, because in the Beauty which is man’s
prototype no such characteristics are to be found. Now let the following
statement <span id="fr_1797"></span>[1799](#fn_1797.md) be offered as a
mere exercise (in interpretation). I pray that it may escape the sneers
of cavilling hearers. Scripture informs us that the Deity proceeded by a
sort of graduated and ordered advance to the creation of man. After the
foundations of the universe were laid, as the history records, man did
not appear on the earth at once; but the creation of the brutes preceded
his, and the plants preceded them. Thereby Scripture shows that the
vital forces blended with the world of matter according to a gradation;
first, it infused itself into insensate nature; and in continuation of
this advanced into the sentient world; and then ascended to intelligent
and rational beings. Accordingly, while all existing things must be
either corporeal or spiritual, the former are divided into the animate
and inanimate. By animate, I mean possessed of life: and of the things
possessed of life, some have it with sensation, the rest have no
sensation. Again, of these sentient things, some have reason, the rest
have not. Seeing, then, that this life of sensation could not possibly
exist apart from the matter which is the subject of it, and the
intellectual life could not be embodied, either, without growing in the
sentient, on this account the creation of man is related as coming last,
as of one who took up into himself every single form of life, both that
of plants and that which is seen in brutes. His nourishment and growth
he derives from vegetable life; for even in vegetables such processes
are to be seen when aliment is being drawn in by their roots and given
off in fruit and leaves. His sentient organization he derives from the
brute creation. But his faculty of thought and reason is
incommunicable <span id="fr_1798"></span>[1800](#fn_1798.md) , and is a
peculiar gift in our nature, to be considered by itself. However, just
as this nature has the instinct acquisitive of the necessaries to
material existence—an instinct which, when manifested in us men, we call
Appetite—and as we admit this appertains to the vegetable form of life,
since we can notice it there too like so many impulses working naturally
to satisfy themselves with their kindred aliment and to issue in
germination, so all the peculiar conditions of the brute creation are
blended with the intellectual part of the soul. To them, she continued,
belongs anger; to them belongs fear; to them all those other opposing
activities within us; <span id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_442"></span>everything except the faculty of reason
and thought. That alone, the choice product, as has been said, of all
our life, bears the stamp of the Divine character. But since, according
to the view which we have just enunciated, it is not possible for this
reasoning faculty to exist in the life of the body without existing by
means of sensations, and since sensation is already found subsisting in
the brute creation, necessarily as it were, by reason of this one
condition, our soul has touch with the other things which are knit up
with it <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1801](#fn_1799.md) ; and these are all
those phænomena within us that we call “passions”; which have not been
allotted to human nature for any bad purpose at all (for the Creator
would most certainly be the author of evil, if in *them*, so deeply
rooted as they are in our nature, any necessities of wrong-doing were
found), but according to the use which our free will puts them to, these
emotions of the soul become the instruments of virtue or of vice. They
are like the iron which is being fashioned according to the volition of
the artificer, and receives whatever shape the idea which is in his mind
prescribes, and becomes a sword or some agricultural implement.
Supposing, then, that our reason, which is our nature’s choicest part,
holds the dominion over these imported emotions (as Scripture
allegorically declares in the command to men to rule over the brutes),
none of them will be active in the ministry of evil; fear will only
generate within us obedience <span id="fr_1800"></span>[1802](#fn_1800.md)
, and anger fortitude, and cowardice caution; and the instinct of desire
will procure for us the delight that is Divine and perfect. But if
reason drops the reins and is dragged behind like a charioteer who has
got entangled in his car, then these instincts are changed into
fierceness, just as we see happens amongst the brutes. For since reason
does not preside over the natural impulses that are implanted <span
id="fr_1801"></span>[1803](#fn_1801.md) in them, the more irascible
animals, under the generalship of their anger, mutually destroy each
other; while the bulky and powerful animals get no good themselves from
their strength, but become by their want of reason slaves of that which
has reason. Neither are the activities of their desire for pleasure
employed on any of the higher objects; nor does any other instinct to be
observed in them result in any profit to themselves. Thus too, with
ourselves, if these instincts are not turned by reasoning into the right
direction, and if our feelings get the mastery of our mind, the man is
changed from a reasoning into an unreasoning being, and from godlike
intelligence sinks by the force of these passions to the level of the
brute.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p103"></span>Much moved by these words, I said: To
any one who reflects indeed, your exposition, advancing as it does in
this consecutive manner, though plain and unvarnished, bears
sufficiently upon it the stamp of correctness and hits the truth. And to
those who are expert only in the technical methods of proof a mere
demonstration suffices to convince; but as for ourselves, we were
agreed <span id="fr_1802"></span>[1804](#fn_1802.md) that there is
something more trustworthy than any of these artificial conclusions,
namely, that which the teachings of Holy Scripture point to: and so I
deem that it is necessary to inquire, in addition to what has been said,
whether this inspired teaching harmonizes with it all.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p105"></span>And who, she replied, could deny that
truth is to be found only in that upon which the seal of Scriptural
testimony is set? So, if it is necessary that something from the Gospels
should be adduced in support of our view, a study of the Parable of the
Wheat and Tares will not be here out of place. The Householder there
sowed good seed; (and we are plainly the “house”). But the “enemy,”
having watched for the time when men slept, sowed that which was useless
in that which was good for food, setting the tares in the very middle of
the wheat. The two kinds of seed grew up together; for it was not
possible that seed put into the very middle of the wheat should fail to
grow up with it. But the Superintendent of the field forbids the
servants to gather up the useless crop, on account of their growing at
the very root of the contrary sort; so as not to root up <span
id="fr_1803"></span>[1805](#fn_1803.md) the nutritious along with that
foreign growth. Now we think that Scripture means by the good seed the
corresponding impulses of the soul, each one of which, if only they are
cultured for good, necessarily puts forth the fruit of virtue within us.
But since there has been scattered <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[1806](#fn_1804.md) amongst these the bad seed of the
error of judgment as to the true Beauty which is alone in its intrinsic
nature such, and since this last has been thrown into the shade by the
growth of delusion which springs up along with it (for the active
principle <span id="page_443">p. 443</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_443"></span>of desire does not germinate and increase
in the direction of that natural Beauty which was the object of its
being sown in us, but it has changed its growth so as to move towards a
bestial and unthinking state, this very error as to Beauty carrying its
impulse towards this result; and in the same way the seed of anger does
not steel us to be brave, but only arms us to fight with our own people;
and the power of loving deserts its intellectual objects and becomes
completely mad for the immoderate enjoyment of pleasures of sense; and
so in like manner our other affections put forth the worse instead of
the better growths),—on account of this the wise Husbandman leaves this
growth that has been introduced amongst his seed to remain there, so as
to secure our not being altogether stripped of better hopes by desire
having been rooted out along with that good-for-nothing growth. If our
nature suffered such a mutilation, what will there be to lift us up to
grasp the heavenly delights? If love is taken from us, how shall we be
united to God? If anger is to be extinguished, what arms shall we
possess against the adversary? Therefore the Husbandman leaves those
bastard seeds within us, not for them always to overwhelm the more
precious crop, but in order that the land itself (for so, in his
allegory, he calls the heart) by its native inherent power, which is
that of reasoning, may wither up the one growth and may render the other
fruitful and abundant: but if that is not done, then he commissions the
fire to mark the distinction in the crops. If, then, a man indulges
these affections in a due proportion and holds them in his own power
instead of being held in theirs, employing them for an instrument as a
king does his subjects’ many hands, then efforts towards excellence more
easily succeed for him. But should he become theirs, and, as when any
slaves mutiny against their master, get enslaved <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1807](#fn_1805.md) by those slavish thoughts and
ignominiously bow before them; a prey to his natural inferiors, he will
be forced to turn to those employments which his imperious masters
command. This being so, we shall not pronounce these emotions of the
soul, which lie in the power of their possessors for good or ill, to be
either virtue or vice. But, whenever their impulse is towards what is
noble, then they become matter for praise, as his desire did to Daniel,
and his anger to Phineas, and their grief to those who nobly mourn. But
if they incline to baseness, then these are, and they are called, bad
passions.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p109"></span>She ceased after this statement and
allowed the discussion a short interval, in which I reviewed mentally
all that had been said; and reverting to that former course of proof in
her discourse, that it was not impossible that the soul after the body’s
dissolution should reside in its atoms, I again addressed her. Where is
that much-talked-of and renowned Hades <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1808](#fn_1806.md) , then? The word is in frequent
circulation both in the intercourse of daily life, and in the writings
of the heathens and in our own; and all think that into it, as into a
place of safe-keeping, souls migrate from here. Surely you would not
call your atoms that Hades.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p111"></span>Clearly, replied the Teacher, you have
not quite attended to the argument. In speaking of the soul’s migration
from the seen to the unseen, I thought I had omitted nothing as regards
the question about Hades. It seems to me that, whether in the heathen or
in the Divine writings, this word for a place in which souls are said to
be means nothing else but a transition to that Unseen world of which we
have no glimpse.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p112"></span>And how, then, I asked, is it that some
think that by the underworld <span id="fr_1807"></span>[1809](#fn_1807.md)
is meant an actual place, and that it harbours within itself <span
id="fr_1808"></span>[1810](#fn_1808.md) the souls that have at last flitted
away from human life, drawing them towards itself as the right
receptacle for such natures?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p115"></span>Well, replied the Teacher, our doctrine
will be in no ways injured by such a supposition. For if it *is* true,
what you say <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1811](#fn_1809.md) , and also that
the vault of heaven prolongs itself so uninterruptedly that it encircles
all things with itself, and that the earth and its surroundings are
poised in the middle, and that the motion of all the revolving
bodies <span id="fr_1810"></span>[1812](#fn_1810.md) is round this fixed
and solid centre, then, I say, there is an absolute necessity that,
whatever may happen to each one of the atoms on the upper side of the
earth, the same will happen on the opposite side, seeing that one single
substance encompasses its entire bulk. As, when the sun shines *above*
the earth, the shadow is spread over its lower part, because its
spherical shape makes it impossible for it to be clasped all round at
one and the same time by the rays, and necessarily, on whatever side the
sun’s rays may fall on some particular point of the globe, if we follow
a straight diameter, we shall find shadow upon the opposite point, and
so, continuously, at the opposite end of the direct line of the rays
<span id="page_444">p. 444</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_444"></span>shadow moves round that globe, keeping
pace with the sun, so that equally in their turn both the upper half and
the under half of the earth are in light and darkness; so, by this
analogy, we have reason to be certain that, whatever in our hemisphere
is observed to befall the atoms, the same will befall them in that
other. The environment of the atoms being one and the same on every side
of the earth, I deem it right neither to contradict nor yet to favour
those who raise the objection that we must regard either this or the
lower region as assigned to the souls released. As long as this
objection does not shake our central doctrine of the existence of those
souls after the life in the flesh, there need be no controversy about
the whereabouts to our mind, holding as we do that place is a property
of body only, and that soul, being immaterial, is by no necessity of its
nature detained in any place.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p118"></span>But what, I asked, if your opponent
should shield himself <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1813](#fn_1811.md) behind
the Apostle, where he says that every reasoning creature, in the
restitution of all things, is to look towards Him Who presides over the
whole? In that passage in the Epistle to the Philippians <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[1814](#fn_1812.md) he makes mention of certain things
that are “under the earth” “every knee shall bow” to Him “of things in
heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.”

<span id="x.iii.ii-p121"></span>We shall stand by our doctrine, answered
the Teacher, even if we should hear them adducing these words. For the
existence of the soul (after death) we have the assent of our opponent,
and so we do not make an objection as to the place, as we have just
said.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p122"></span>But if some were to ask the meaning of
the Apostle in this utterance, what is one to say? Would you remove all
signification of place from the passage?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p123"></span>I do not think, she replied, that the
divine Apostle divided the intellectual world into localities, when he
named part as in heaven, part as on earth, and part as under the earth.
There are three states in which reasoning creatures can be: one from the
very first received an immaterial life, and we call it the angelic:
another is in union with the flesh, and we call it the human: a third is
released by death from fleshly entanglements, and is to be found in
souls pure and simple. Now I think that the divine Apostle in his deep
wisdom looked to this, when he revealed the future concord of all these
reasoning beings in the work of goodness; and that he puts the
unembodied angel-world “in heaven,” and that still involved with a body
“on earth,” and that released from a body “under the earth”; or, indeed,
if there is any other world to be classed under that which is possessed
of reason (it is not left out); and whether any one choose to call this
last “demons” or “spirits,” or anything else of the kind, we shall not
care. We certainly believe, both because of the prevailing opinion, and
still more of Scripture teaching, that there exists another world of
beings besides, divested of such bodies as ours are, who are opposed to
that which is good and are capable of hurting the lives of men, having
by an act of will lapsed from the nobler view <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1815](#fn_1813.md) , and by this revolt from goodness
personified in themselves the contrary principle; and this world is
what, some say, the Apostle adds to the number of the “things under the
earth,” signifying in that passage that when evil shall have been some
day annihilated in the long revolutions of the ages, nothing shall be
left outside the world of goodness, but that even from those evil
spirits <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1816](#fn_1814.md) shall rise in harmony
the confession of Christ’s Lordship. If this is so, then no one can
compel us to see any spot of the underworld in the expression, “things
under the earth”; the atmosphere spreads equally over every part of the
earth, and there is not a single corner of it left unrobed by this
circumambient air.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p126"></span>When she had finished, I hesitated a
moment, and then said: I am not yet satisfied about the thing which we
have been inquiring into; after all that has been said my mind is still
in doubt; and I beg that our discussion may be allowed to revert to the
same line of reasoning as before <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1817](#fn_1815.md) , omitting only that upon which we
are thoroughly agreed. I say this, for I think that all but the most
stubborn controversialists will <span id="page_445">p. 445</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_445"></span>have been sufficiently convinced by our
debate not to consign the soul after the body’s dissolution to
annihilation and nonentity, nor to argue that because it differs
substantially from the atoms it is impossible for it to exist anywhere
in the universe; for, however much a being that is intellectual and
immaterial may fail to coincide with these atoms, it is in no ways
hindered (so far) from existing in them; and this belief of ours rests
on two facts: firstly, on the soul’s existing in our bodies in this
present life, though fundamentally different from them: and secondly, on
the fact that the Divine being, as our argument has shown, though
distinctly something other than visible and material substances,
nevertheless pervades each one amongst all existences, and by this
penetration of the whole keeps the world in a state of being; so that
following these analogies we need not think that the soul, either, is
out of existence, when she passes from the world of forms to the Unseen.
But how, I insisted, after the united whole of the atoms has
assumed <span id="fr_1816"></span>[1818](#fn_1816.md) , owing to their
mixing together, a form quite different—the form in fact with which the
soul has been actually domesticated—by what mark, when this form, as we
should have expected, is effaced along with the resolution of the atoms,
shall the soul follow along (them), now that that familiar form ceases
to persist?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p129"></span>She waited a moment and then said: Give
me leave to invent a fanciful simile in order to illustrate the matter
before us: even though that which I suppose may be outside the range of
possibility. Grant it possible, then, in the art of painting not only to
mix opposite colours, as painters are always doing, to represent a
particular tint <span id="fr_1817"></span>[1819](#fn_1817.md) , but also to
separate again this mixture and to restore to each of the colours its
natural dye. If then white, or black, or red, or golden colour, or any
other colour that has been mixed to form the given tint, were to be
again separated from that union with another and remain by itself, we
suppose that our artist will none the less remember the actual nature of
that colour, and that in no case will he show forgetfulness, either of
the red, for instance, or the black, if after having become quite a
different colour by composition with each other they each return to
their natural dye. We suppose, I say, that our artist remembers the
manner of the mutual blending of these colours, and so knows what sort
of colour was mixed with a given colour and what sort of colour was the
result, and how, the other colour being ejected from the composition,
(the original colour) in consequence of such release resumed its own
peculiar hue; and, supposing it were required to produce the same result
again by composition, the process will be all the easier from having
been already practised in his previous work. Now, if reason can see any
analogy in this simile, we must search the matter in hand by its light.
Let the soul stand for this Art of the painter <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1820](#fn_1818.md) ; and let the natural atoms stand
for the colours of his art; and let the mixture of that tint compounded
of the various dyes, and the return of these to their native state
(which we have been allowed to assume), represent respectively the
concourse, and the separation of the atoms. Then, as we assume in the
simile that the painter’s Art tells him the actual dye of each colour,
when it has returned after mixing to its proper hue, so that he has an
exact knowledge of the red, and of the black, and of any other colour
that went to form the required tint by a specific way of uniting with
another kind—a knowledge which includes its appearance both in the
mixture, and now when it is in its natural state, and in the future
again, supposing all the colours were mixed over again in like
fashion—so, we assert, does the soul know the natural peculiarities of
those atoms whose concourse makes the frame of the body in which it has
itself grown, even after the scattering of those atoms. However far from
each other their natural propensity and their inherent forces of
repulsion urge them, and debar each from mingling with its opposite,
none the less will the soul be near each by its power of recognition,
and will persistently cling to the familiar atoms, until their concourse
after this division again takes place in the same way, for that fresh
formation of the dissolved body which will properly be, and be called,
resurrection.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p132"></span>You seem, I interrupted, in this passing
remark to have made an excellent defence of the faith in the
Resurrection. By it, I think, the opponents of this doctrine might be
gradually led to consider it not as a thing absolutely impossible that
the atoms should again coalesce and form the same man as before.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p133"></span>That is very true, the Teacher replied.
For we may hear these opponents urging the following difficulty. “The
atoms are resolved, like <span id="page_446">p. 446</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_446"></span>to like, into the universe; by what
device, then, does the warmth, for instance, residing in such and such a
man, after joining the universal warmth, again dissociate itself from
this connection with its kindred <span
id="fr_1819"></span>[1821](#fn_1819.md) , so as to form this man who is
being ‘remoulded’? For if the identical individual particle does not
return and only something that is homogeneous but not identical is
fetched, you will have something else in the place of that first thing,
and such a process will cease to be a resurrection and will be merely
the creation of a new man. But if the same man is to return into
himself, he must be the same entirely, and regain his original formation
in every single atom of his elements.”

<span id="x.iii.ii-p135"></span>Then to meet such an objection, I
rejoined, the above opinion about the soul will, as I said, avail;
namely, that she remains after dissolution in those very atoms in which
she first grew up, and, like a guardian placed over private property,
does not abandon them when they are mingled with their kindred atoms,
and by the subtle ubiquity of her intelligence makes no mistake about
them, with all their subtle minuteness, but diffuses herself along with
those which belong to herself when they are being mingled with their
kindred dust, and suffers no exhaustion in keeping up with the whole
number of them when they stream back into the universe, but remains with
them, no matter in what direction or in what fashion Nature may arrange
them. But should the signal be given by the All-disposing Power for
these scattered atoms to combine again, then, just as when every one of
the various ropes that hang from one block answer at one and the same
moment <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1822](#fn_1820.md) to the pull from that
centre, so, following this force of the soul which acts upon the various
atoms, all these, once so familiar with each other, rush simultaneously
together and form the cable of the body by means of the soul, each
single one of them being wedded to its former neighbour and embracing an
old acquaintance.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p137"></span>The following illustration also, the
Teacher went on, might be very properly added to those already brought
forward, to show that the soul has not need of much teaching in order to
distinguish its own from the alien amongst the atoms. Imagine a potter
with a supply of clay; and let the supply be a large one; and let part
of it have been already moulded to form finished vessels, while the rest
is still waiting to be moulded; and suppose the vessels themselves not
to be all of similar shape, but one to be a jug, for instance, and
another a wine-jar, another a plate, another a cup or any other useful
vessel; and further, let not one owner possess them all, but let us
fancy for each a special owner. Now as long as these vessels are
unbroken they are of course recognizable by their owners, and none the
less so, even should they be broken in pieces; for from those pieces
each will know, for instance, that this belongs to a jar <span
id="fr_1821"></span>[1823](#fn_1821.md) , and, again, what sort of fragment
belongs to a cup. And if they are plunged again into the unworked clay,
the discernment between what has been already worked and that clay will
be a more unerring one still. The individual man is as such a vessel; he
has been moulded out of the universal matter, owing to the concourse of
his atoms; and he exhibits in a form peculiarly his own a marked
distinction from his kind; and when that form has gone to pieces the
soul that has been mistress of this particular vessel will have an exact
knowledge of it, derived even from its fragments; nor will she leave
this property, either, in the common blending with all the other
fragments, or if it be plunged into the still formless part of the
matter from which the atoms have come <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1824](#fn_1822.md) ; she always remembers her own as
it was when compact in bodily form, and after dissolution she never
makes any mistake about it, led by marks still clinging to the remains.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p140"></span>I applauded this as well devised to
bring out the natural features of the case before us; and I said: It is
very well to speak like this and to believe that it is so; but suppose
some one were to quote against it our Lord’s narrative about those who
are in hell, as not harmonizing with the results of our inquiry, how are
we to be prepared with an answer?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p141"></span>The Teacher answered: The expressions of
that narrative of the Word are certainly material; but still many hints
are interspersed in it to rouse the skilled inquirer to a more
discriminating study of it. I mean that He Who parts the good from the
bad by a great gulf, and makes the man in torment crave for a drop to be
conveyed by a finger, and the man who has been ill-treated in this life
rest on a patriarch’s bosom, and Who relates their previous death and
consignment to the tomb, takes an intelligent searcher of His meaning
far beyond a superficial interpretation. For what sort of eyes has the
<span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_447"></span>Rich Man to lift up in hell, when he has
left his bodily eyes in that tomb? And how can a disembodied spirit feel
any flame? And what sort of tongue can he crave to be cooled with the
drop of water, when he has lost his tongue of flesh? What is the finger
that is to convey to him this drop? What sort of place is the “bosom” of
repose? The bodies of both of them are in the tomb, and their souls are
disembodied, and do not consist of parts either; and so it is impossible
to make the framework of the narrative correspond with the truth, if we
understand it literally; we can do that only by translating each detail
into an equivalent in the world of ideas. Thus we must think of the gulf
as that which parts ideas which may not be confounded from running
together, not as a chasm of the earth. Such a chasm, however vast it
were, could be traversed with no difficulty by a disembodied
intelligence; since intelligence can in no time <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1825](#fn_1823.md) be wherever it will.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p143"></span>What then, I asked, *are* the fire and
the gulf and the other features in the picture? Are they not that which
they are said to be?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p144"></span>I think, she replied, that the Gospel
signifies by means of each of them certain doctrines with regard to our
question of the soul. For when the patriarch first says to the Rich Man,
“Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things,” and in the same way
speaks of the Poor Man, that he, namely, has done his duty in bearing
his share of life’s evil things, and then, after that, adds with regard
to the gulf that it is a barrier between them, he evidently by such
expressions intimates a very important truth; and, to my thinking, it is
as follows. Once man’s life had but one character; and by that I mean
that it was to be found only in the category of the good and had no
contact with evil. The first of God’s commandments attests the truth of
this; that, namely, which gave to man unstinted enjoyment of all the
blessings of Paradise, forbidding only that which was a mixture of good
and evil and so composed of contraries, but making death the penalty for
transgressing in that particular. But man, acting freely by a voluntary
impulse, deserted the lot that was unmixed with evil, and drew upon
himself that which was a mixture of contraries. Yet Divine Providence
did not leave that recklessness of ours without a corrective. Death
indeed, as the fixed penalty for breaking the law, necessarily fell upon
its transgressors; but God divided the life of man into two parts,
namely, this present life, and that “out of the body” hereafter; and He
placed on the first a limit of the briefest possible time, while He
prolonged the other into eternity; and in His love for man He gave him
his choice, to have the one or the other of those things, good or evil,
I mean, in which of the two parts he liked: either in this short and
transitory life, or in those endless ages, whose limit is infinity. Now
these expressions “good” and “evil” are equivocal; they are used in two
senses, one relating to mind and the other to sense; some classify as
good whatever is pleasant to feeling: others are confident that only
that which is perceptible by intelligence is good and deserves that
name. Those, then, whose reasoning powers have never been exercised and
who have never had a glimpse of the better way soon use up on gluttony
in this fleshly life the dividend of good which their constitution can
claim, and they reserve none of it for the after life; but those who by
a discreet and sober-minded calculation economize the powers of living
are afflicted by things painful to sense here, but they reserve their
good for the succeeding life, and so their happier lot is lengthened out
to last as long as that eternal life. This, in my opinion, is the
“gulf”; which is not made by the parting of the earth, but by those
decisions in this life which result in a separation into opposite
characters. The man who has once chosen pleasure in this life, and has
not cured his inconsiderateness by repentance, places the land of the
good beyond his own reach; for he has dug against himself the yawning
impassable abyss of a necessity that nothing can break through. This is
the reason, I think, that the name of Abraham’s bosom is given to that
good situation of the soul in which Scripture makes the athlete of
endurance repose. For it is related of this patriarch first, of all up
to that time born, that he exchanged the enjoyment of the present for
the hope of the future; he was stripped of all the surroundings in which
his life at first was passed, and resided amongst foreigners, and thus
purchased by present annoyance future blessedness. As then
figuratively <span id="fr_1824"></span>[1826](#fn_1824.md) we call a
particular circuit of the ocean a “bosom,” so does Scripture seem to me
to express the idea of those measureless blessings above by the word
“bosom,” meaning a place into which all virtuous voyagers of this life
are, when they have put in from hence, brought to anchor in the waveless
harbour of that gulf of blessings <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[1827](#fn_1825.md) . Meanwhile the denial of these
blessings which they witness becomes in the others a flame, which burns
the soul and causes the craving for the refreshment of one drop out of
that ocean of blessings wherein the saints are affluent; which
nevertheless they do not get. If, too, <span id="page_448">p. 448</span>
<span id="x.iii.ii-Page_448"></span>you consider the “tongue,” and the
“eye,” and the “finger,” and the other names of bodily organs, which
occur in the conversation between those disembodied souls, you will be
persuaded that this conjecture of ours about them chimes in with the
opinion we have already stated about the soul. Look closely into the
meaning of those words. For as the concourse of atoms forms the
substance of the entire body, so it is reasonable to think that the same
cause operates to complete the substance of each member of the body. If,
then, the soul is present with the atoms of the body when they are again
mingled with the universe, it will not only be cognizant of the entire
mass which once came together to form the whole body, and will be
present with it, but, besides that, will not fail to know the particular
materials of each one of the members, so as to remember by what
divisions amongst the atoms our limbs were completely formed. There is,
then, nothing improbable in supposing that what is present in the
complete mass is present also in each division of the mass. If one,
then, thinks of those atoms in which each detail of the body potentially
inheres, and surmises that Scripture means a “finger” and a “tongue” and
an “eye” and the rest as existing, after dissolution, only in the sphere
of the soul, one will not miss the probable truth. Moreover, if each
detail carries the mind away from a material acceptation of the story,
surely the “hell” which we have just been speaking of cannot reasonably
be thought a place so named; rather we are there told by Scripture about
a certain unseen and immaterial situation in which the soul resides. In
this story of the Rich and the Poor Man we are taught another doctrine
also, which is intimately connected with our former discoveries. The
story makes the sensual pleasure-loving man, when he sees that his own
case is one that admits of no escape, evince forethought for his
relations on earth; and when Abraham tells him that the life of those
still in the flesh is not unprovided with a guidance, for they may find
it at hand, if they will, in the Law and the Prophets, he still
continues entreating that Just <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1828](#fn_1826.md) Patriarch, and asks that a sudden
and convincing message, brought by some one risen from the dead, may be
sent to them.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p148"></span>What then, I asked, is the doctrine
here?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p149"></span>Why, seeing that Lazarus’ soul is
occupied <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1829](#fn_1827.md) with his present
blessings and turns round to look at nothing that he has left, while the
rich man is still attached, with a cement as it were, even after death,
to the life of feeling, which he does not divest himself of even when he
has ceased to live, still keeping as he does flesh and blood in his
thoughts (for in his entreaty that his kindred may be exempted from his
sufferings he plainly shows that he is not freed yet from fleshly
feeling),—in such details of the story (she continued) I think our Lord
teaches us this; that those still living in the flesh must as much as
ever they can separate and free themselves in a way from its attachments
by virtuous conduct, in order that after death they may not need a
second death to cleanse them from the remnants that are owing to this
cement <span id="fr_1828"></span>[1830](#fn_1828.md) of the flesh, and,
when once the bonds are loosed from around the soul, her soaring <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1831](#fn_1829.md) up to the Good may be swift and
unimpeded, with no anguish of the body to distract her. For if any one
becomes wholly and thoroughly carnal in thought, such an one, with every
motion and energy of the soul absorbed in fleshly desires, is not parted
from such attachments, even in the disembodied state; just as those who
have lingered long in noisome places do not part with the unpleasantness
contracted by that lengthened stay, even when they pass into a sweet
atmosphere. So <span id="fr_1830"></span>[1832](#fn_1830.md) it is that,
when the change is made into the impalpable Unseen, not even then will
it be possible for the lovers of the flesh to avoid dragging away with
them under any circumstances some fleshly foulness; and thereby their
torment will be intensified, their soul having been materialized by such
surroundings. I think too that this view of the matter harmonizes to a
certain extent with the assertion made by some persons that around their
graves shadowy phantoms of the departed are often seen <span
id="fr_1831"></span>[1833](#fn_1831.md) . If this is really so, an
inordinate attachment of that particular soul to the life in the flesh
is proved to have existed, causing it to be unwilling, even when
expelled from the flesh, to fly clean away and to admit the com<span
id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_449"></span>plete
change of its form into the impalpable; it remains near the frame even
after the dissolution of the frame, and though now outside it, hovers
regretfully over the place where its material is and continues to haunt
it.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p155"></span>Then, after a moment’s reflection on the
meaning of these latter words, I said: I think that a contradiction now
arises between what you have said and the result of our former
examination of the passions. For if, on the one hand, the activity of
such movements within us is to be held as arising from our kinship with
the brutes, such movements I mean as were enumerated in our previous
discussion <span id="fr_1832"></span>[1834](#fn_1832.md) , anger, for
instance, and fear, desire of pleasure, and so on, and, on the other
hand, it was affirmed that virtue consists in the good employment of
these movements, and vice in their bad employment, and in addition to
this we discussed the actual contribution of each of the other passions
to a virtuous life, and found that through desire above all we are
brought nearer God, drawn up, by its chain as it were, from earth
towards Him,—I think (I said) that that part of the discussion is in a
way opposed to that which we are now aiming at.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p157"></span>How so? she asked.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p158"></span>Why, when every unreasoning instinct is
quenched within us after our purgation, this principle of desire will
not exist any more than the other principles; and this being removed, it
looks as if the striving after the better way would also cease, no other
emotion remaining in the soul that can stir us up to the appetence of
Good.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p159"></span>To that objection, she replied, we
answer this. The speculative and critical faculty is the property of the
soul’s godlike part; for it is by these that we grasp the Deity also.
If, then whether by forethought here, or by purgation hereafter, our
soul becomes free from any emotional connection with the brute creation,
there will be nothing to impede its contemplation of the Beautiful; for
this last is essentially capable of attracting in a certain way every
being that looks towards it. If, then, the soul is purified of every
vice, it will most certainly be in the sphere of Beauty. The Deity is in
very substance Beautiful; and to the Deity the soul will in its state of
purity have affinity, and will embrace It as like itself. Whenever this
happens, then, there will be no longer need of the impulse of Desire to
lead the way to the Beautiful. Whoever passes his time in darkness, he
it is who will be under the influence of a desire for the light; but
whenever he comes into the light, then enjoyment takes the place of
desire, and the power to enjoy renders desire useless and out of date.
It will therefore be no detriment to our participation in the Good, that
the soul should be free from such emotions, and turning back upon
herself should know herself accurately what her actual nature is, and
should behold the Original Beauty reflected in the mirror and in the
figure of her own beauty. For truly herein consists the real
assimilation to the Divine; viz. in making our own life in some degree a
copy of the Supreme Being. For a Nature like that, which transcends all
thought and is far removed from all that we observe within ourselves,
proceeds in its existence in a very different manner to what we do in
this present life. Man, possessing a constitution whose law it is to be
moving, is carried in that particular direction whither the impulse of
his will directs: and so his soul is not affected in the same way
towards what lies before it <span id="fr_1833"></span>[1835](#fn_1833.md) ,
as one may say, as to what it has left behind; for hope leads the
forward movement, but it is memory that succeeds that movement when it
has advanced to the attainment of the hope; and if it is to something
intrinsically good that hope thus leads on the soul, the print that this
exercise of the will leaves upon the memory is a bright one; but if hope
has seduced the soul with some phantom only of the Good, and the
excellent Way has been missed, then the memory that succeeds what has
happened becomes shame, and an intestine war is thus waged in the soul
between memory and hope, because the last has been such a bad leader of
the will. Such in fact is the state of mind that shame gives expression
to; the soul is stung as it were at the result; its remorse for its
ill-considered attempt is a whip that makes it feel to the quick, and it
would bring in oblivion to its aid against its tormentor. Now in our
case nature, owing to its being indigent of the Good, is aiming always
at this which is still wanting to it, and this aiming at a still missing
thing is this very habit of Desire, which our constitution displays
equally, whether it is baulked of the real Good, or wins that which it
is good to win. But a nature that surpasses every idea that we can form
of the Good and transcends all other power, being in no want of anything
that can be regarded as good, is itself the plenitude of every good; it
does not move in the sphere of the good by way of participation in it
only, but it is itself the substance of the Good (whatever we imagine
the Good to be); it neither gives scope for any rising hope (for hope
manifests activity in the direction of something absent; but “what a man
has, why doth he yet hope for?” as the Apostle asks), nor is it in want
of the activity of the memory for the knowledge <span id="page_450">p.
450</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_450"></span>of things; that which is
actually seen has no need of being remembered. Since, then, this Divine
nature is beyond any particular good <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[1836](#fn_1834.md) , and to the good the good is an
object of love, it follows that when It looks within Itself <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1837](#fn_1835.md) , It wishes for what It contains
and contains that which It wishes, and admits nothing external. Indeed
there is nothing external to It, with the sole exception of evil, which,
strange as it may seem to say, possesses an existence in not existing at
all. For there is no other origin of evil except the negation of the
existent, and the truly-existent forms the substance of the Good. That
therefore which is not to be found in the existent must be in the
non-existent. Whenever the soul, then, having divested itself of the
multifarious emotions incident to its nature, gets its Divine form and,
mounting above Desire, enters within that towards which it was once
incited by that Desire, it offers no harbour within itself either for
hope or for memory. It holds the object of the one; the other is
extruded from the consciousness by the occupation in enjoying all that
is good: and thus the soul copies the life that is above, and is
conformed to the peculiar features of the Divine nature; none of its
habits are left to it except that of love, which clings by natural
affinity to the Beautiful. For this is what love is; the inherent
affection towards a chosen object. When, then, the soul, having become
simple and single in form and so perfectly godlike, finds that perfectly
simple and immaterial good which is really worth enthusiasm and
love <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1838](#fn_1836.md) , it attaches itself to
it and blends with it by means of the movement and activity of love,
fashioning itself according to that which it is continually finding and
grasping. Becoming by this assimilation to the Good all that the nature
of that which it participates is, the soul will consequently, owing to
there being no lack of any good in that thing itself which it
participates, be itself also in no lack of anything, and so will expel
from within the activity and the habit of Desire; for this arises only
when the thing missed is not found. For this teaching we have the
authority of God’s own Apostle, who announces a subduing <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1839](#fn_1837.md) and a ceasing of all other
activities, even for the good, which are within us, and finds no limit
for love alone. Prophecies, he says, shall fail; forms of knowledge
shall cease; but “charity never faileth;” which is equivalent to its
being always as it is: and though <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1840](#fn_1838.md) he says that faith and hope have
endured so far by the side of love, yet again he prolongs its date
beyond theirs, and with good reason too; for hope is in operation only
so long as the enjoyment of the things hoped for is not to be had; and
faith in the same way is a support <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1841](#fn_1839.md) in the uncertainty about the things
hoped for; for so he defines it—“the substance <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1842](#fn_1840.md) of things hoped for”; but when the
thing hoped for actually comes, then all other faculties are reduced to
quiescence <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1843](#fn_1841.md) , and love alone
remains active, finding nothing to succeed itself. Love, therefore, is
the foremost of all excellent achievements and the first of the
commandments of the law. If ever, then, the soul reach this goal, it
will be in no need of anything else; it will embrace that plenitude of
things which are, whereby alone <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1844](#fn_1842.md) it seems in any way to preserve
within itself the stamp of God’s actual blessedness. For the life of the
Supreme Being is love, seeing that the Beautiful is necessarily lovable
to those who recognize it, and the Deity does recognize it, and so this
recognition becomes love, that which He recognizes being essentially
beautiful. This True Beauty the insolence of satiety cannot touch <span
id="fr_1843"></span>[1845](#fn_1843.md) ; and no satiety interrupting this
continuous capacity to love the Beautiful, God’s life will have its
activity in love; which life is thus in itself beautiful, and is
essentially of a loving disposition towards the Beautiful, and receives
no check to this activity of love. In fact, in the Beautiful no limit is
to be found so that love should have to cease with any limit of the
Beautiful. This last can be ended only by its opposite; but when you
have a good, as here, which is in its essence incapable of a change for
the worse, then that good will go on unchecked into infinity. Moreover,
as every being is capable of attracting its like, and humanity is, in a
way, like God, as bearing within itself some resemblances to its
Prototype, the soul is by a strict necessity attracted to the kindred
Deity. In fact what belongs to God must by all means and at any cost be
preserved <span id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_451"></span>for Him. If, then, on the one hand, the
soul is unencumbered with superfluities and no trouble connected with
the body presses it down, its advance towards Him Who draws it to
Himself is sweet and congenial. But suppose <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1846](#fn_1844.md) , on the other hand, that it has
been transfixed with the nails of propension <span
id="fr_1845"></span>[1847](#fn_1845.md) so as to be held down to a habit
connected with material things,—a case like that of those in the ruins
caused by earthquakes, whose bodies are crushed by the mounds of
rubbish; and let us imagine by way of illustration that these are not
only pressed down by the weight of the ruins, but have been pierced as
well with some spikes and splinters discovered with them in the rubbish.
What then, would naturally be the plight of those bodies, when they were
being dragged by relatives from the ruins to receive the holy rites of
burial, mangled and torn entirely, disfigured in the most direful manner
conceivable, with the nails beneath the heap harrowing them by the very
violence necessary to pull them out?—Such I think is the plight of the
soul as well when the Divine force, for God’s very love of man, drags
that which belongs to Him from the ruins of the irrational and material.
Not in hatred or revenge for a wicked life, to my thinking, does God
bring upon sinners those painful dispensations; He is only claiming and
drawing to Himself whatever, to please Him, came into existence. But
while He for a noble end is attracting the soul to Himself, the Fountain
of all Blessedness, it is the occasion necessarily to the being so
attracted of a state of torture. Just as those who refine gold from the
dross which it contains not only get this base alloy to melt in the
fire, but are obliged to melt the pure gold along with the alloy, and
then while this last is being consumed the gold remains, so, while evil
is being consumed in the purgatorial <span
id="fr_1846"></span>[1848](#fn_1846.md) fire, the soul that is welded to
this evil must inevitably be in the fire too, until the spurious
material alloy is consumed and annihilated by this fire. If a clay of
the more tenacious kind is deeply plastered round a rope, and then the
end of the rope is put through a narrow hole, and then some one on the
further side violently pulls it by that end, the result must be that,
while the rope itself obeys the force exerted, the clay that has been
plastered upon it is scraped off it with this violent pulling and is
left outside the hole, and, moreover, is the cause why the rope does not
run easily through the passage, but has to undergo a violent tension at
the hands of the puller. In such a manner, I think, we may figure to
ourselves the agonized struggle of that soul which has wrapped itself up
in earthy material passions, when God is drawing it, His own one, to
Himself, and the foreign matter, which has somehow grown into its
substance, has to be scraped from it by main force, and so occasions it
that keen intolerable anguish.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p174"></span>Then it seems, I said, that it is not
punishment chiefly and principally that the Deity, as Judge, afflicts
sinners with; but He operates, as your argument has shown, only to get
the good separated from the evil and to attract it into the communion of
blessedness.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p175"></span>That, said the Teacher, is my meaning;
and also that the agony will be measured by the amount of evil there is
in each individual. For it would not be reasonable to think that the man
who has remained so long as we have supposed in evil known to be
forbidden, and the man who has fallen only into moderate sins, should be
tortured to the same amount in the judgment upon their vicious habit;
but according to the quantity of material will be the longer or shorter
time that that agonizing flame will be burning; that is, as long as
there is fuel to feed it. In the case of the man who has acquired a
heavy weight of material, the consuming fire must necessarily be very
searching; but where that which the fire has to feed upon <span
id="fr_1847"></span>[1849](#fn_1847.md) has spread less far, there the
penetrating fierceness of the punishment is mitigated, so far as the
subject itself, in the amount of its evil, is diminished. In any and
every case evil must be removed out of existence, so that, as we said
above, the absolutely non-existent should cease to be at all. Since it
is not in its nature that evil should exist outside the will, does it
not follow that when it shall be that every will rests in God, evil will
be reduced to complete annihilation, owing to no receptacle being left
for it?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p177"></span>But, said I, what help can one find in
this devout hope, when one considers the greatness of the evil in
undergoing torture even for a single year; and if that intolerable
anguish be prolonged for the interval of an age, what grain of comfort
is left from any subsequent expectation to him whose purgation is thus
commensurate with an entire age? <span
id="fr_1848"></span>[1850](#fn_1848.md)

<span id="x.iii.ii-p179"></span><span id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_452"></span>Why <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1851](#fn_1849.md) , either we must plan to keep the
soul absolutely untouched and free from any stain of evil; or, if our
passionate nature makes that quite impossible, then we must plan that
our failures in excellence consist only in mild and easily-curable
derelictions. For the Gospel in its teaching distinguishes between <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1852](#fn_1850.md) a debtor of ten thousand talents
and a debtor of five hundred pence, and of fifty pence and of a
farthing <span id="fr_1851"></span>[1853](#fn_1851.md) , which is “the
uttermost” of coins; it proclaims that God’s just judgment reaches to
all, and enhances the payment necessary as the weight of the debt
increases, and on the other hand does not overlook the very smallest
debts. But the Gospel tells us that this payment of debts was not
effected by the refunding of money, but that the indebted man was
delivered to the tormentors until he should pay the whole debt; and that
means nothing else than paying in the coin of torment <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1854](#fn_1852.md) the inevitable recompense, the
recompense, I mean, that consists in taking the share of pain incurred
during his lifetime, when he inconsiderately chose mere pleasure,
undiluted with its opposite; so that having put off from him all that
foreign growth which sin is, and discarded the shame of any debts, he
might stand in liberty and fearlessness. Now liberty is the coming up to
a state which owns no master and is self-regulating <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1855](#fn_1853.md) ; it is that with which we were
gifted by God at the beginning, but which has been obscured by the
feeling of shame arising from indebtedness. Liberty too is in all cases
one and the same essentially; it has a natural attraction to itself. It
follows, then, that as everything that is free will be united with its
like, and as virtue is a thing that has no master, that is, is free,
everything that is free will be united with virtue. But, further, the
Divine Being is the fountain of all virtue. Therefore, those who have
parted with evil will be united with Him; and so, as the Apostle says,
God will be “all in all <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1856](#fn_1854.md) ”;
for this utterance seems to me plainly to confirm the opinion we have
already arrived at, for it means that God will be instead of all other
things, and in all. For while our present life is active amongst a
variety of multiform conditions, and the things we have relations with
are numerous, for instance, time, air, locality, food and drink,
clothing, sunlight, lamplight, and other necessities of life, none of
which, many though they be, are God,—that blessed state which we hope
for is in need of none of these things, but the Divine Being will become
all, and instead of all, to us, distributing Himself proportionately to
every need of that existence. It is plain, too, from the Holy Scripture
that God becomes, to those who deserve it, locality, and home, and
clothing, and food, and drink, and light, and riches, and dominion, and
everything thinkable and nameable that goes to make our life happy. But
He that becomes “all” things will be “in all” things too; and herein it
appears to me that Scripture teaches the complete annihilation of
evil <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1857](#fn_1855.md) . If, that is, God will
be “in all” existing things, evil; plainly, will not then be amongst
them; for if any one was to assume that it did exist then, how will the
belief that God will be “in all” be kept intact? The excepting of that
one thing, evil, mars the comprehensiveness of <span id="page_453">p.
453</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_453"></span>the term “all.” But He
that will be “in all” will never be in that which does not exist.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p187"></span>What then, I asked, are we to say to
those whose hearts fail at these calamities <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1858](#fn_1856.md) ?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p189"></span>We will say to them, replied the
Teacher, this. “It is foolish, good people, for you to fret and complain
of the chain of this fixed sequence of life’s realities; you do not know
the goal towards which each single dispensation of the universe is
moving. You do not know that all things have to be assimilated to the
Divine Nature in accordance with the artistic plan of their author, in a
certain regularity and order. Indeed, it was for this that intelligent
beings came into existence; namely, that the riches of the Divine
blessings should not lie idle. The All-creating Wisdom fashioned these
souls, these receptacles with free wills, as vessels as it were, for
this very purpose, that there should be some capacities able to receive
His blessings and become continually larger with the inpouring of the
stream. Such are the wonders <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1859](#fn_1857.md)
that the participation in the Divine blessings works: it makes him into
whom they come larger and more capacious; from his capacity to receive
it gets for the receiver an actual increase in bulk as well, and he
never stops enlarging. The fountain of blessings wells up unceasingly,
and the partaker’s nature, finding nothing superfluous and without a use
in that which it receives, makes the whole influx an enlargement of its
own proportions, and becomes at once more wishful to imbibe the nobler
nourishment and more capable of containing it; each grows along with
each, both the capacity which is nursed in such abundance of blessings
and so grows greater, and the nurturing supply which comes on in a flood
answering to the growth of those increasing powers. It is likely,
therefore, that this bulk will mount to such a magnitude as <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1860](#fn_1858.md) there is no limit to check, so that
we should not grow into it. With such a prospect before us, are you
angry that our nature is advancing to its goal along the path appointed
for us? Why, our career cannot be run thither-ward, except that which
weighs us down, I mean this encumbering load of earthiness, be shaken
off the soul; nor can we be domiciled in Purity with the corresponding
part of our nature, unless we have cleansed ourselves by a better
training from the habit of affection which we have contracted in life
towards this earthiness. But if there be in you any clinging to this
body <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1861](#fn_1859.md) , and the being unlocked
from this darling thing give you pain, let not this, either, make you
despair. You will behold this bodily envelopment, which is now dissolved
in death, woven again out of the same atoms, not indeed into this
organization with its gross and heavy texture, but with its threads
worked up into something more subtle and ethereal, so that you will not
only have near you that which you love, but it will be restored to you
with a brighter and more entrancing beauty <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1862](#fn_1860.md) .”

<span id="x.iii.ii-p202"></span>But it somehow seems to me now, I said,
that the doctrine of the Resurrection necessarily comes on for our
discussion; a doctrine which I think is even at first sight true as well
as credible <span id="fr_1861"></span>[1863](#fn_1861.md) , as it is told
us in Scripture; so that that will not come in question between us: but
since the weakness of the human understanding is strengthened still
farther by any arguments that are intelligible to us, it would be well
not to leave this part of the subject, either, without philosophical
examination. Let us consider, then, what ought to be said about it.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p204"></span>As for the thinkers, the Teacher went
on, outside our own system of thought, they have, with all their diverse
ways of looking at things, one in one point, another in another,
approached and touched the doctrine of the Resurrection: while they none
of them exactly coincide with us, they have in no case wholly abandoned
such an expectation. Some indeed make human nature vile in their
comprehensiveness, maintaining that a soul becomes alternately that of a
man and of something irrational; that it transmigrates into various
bodies, changing at pleasure from the man into fowl, fish, or beast, and
then returning to human kind. While some extend this absurdity even to
trees <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1864](#fn_1862.md) and shrubs, <span
id="page_454">p. 454</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_454"></span>so that
they consider their wooden life as corresponding and akin to humanity,
others of them hold only thus much—that the soul exchanges one man for
another man, so that the life of humanity is continued always by means
of the same souls, which, being exactly the same in number, are being
born perpetually first in one generation, then in another. As for
ourselves, we take our stand upon the tenets of the Church, and assert
that it will be well to accept only so much of these speculations as is
sufficient to show that those who indulge in them are to a certain
extent in accord with the doctrine of the Resurrection. Their statement,
for instance, that the soul after its release from this body insinuates
itself into certain other bodies is not absolutely out of harmony with
the revival which we hope for. For our view, which maintains that the
body, both now, and again in the future, is composed of the atoms of the
universe, is held equally by these heathens. In fact, you cannot imagine
any constitution of the body independent of a concourse <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1865](#fn_1863.md) of these atoms. But the divergence
lies in this: we assert that the same body again as before, composed of
the same atoms, is compacted around the soul; they suppose that the soul
alights on other bodies, not only rational, but irrational and even
insensate; and while all are agreed that these bodies which the soul
resumes derive their substance from the atoms of the universe, they part
company from us in thinking that they are not made out of identically
the same atoms as those which in this mortal life grew around the soul.
Let then, this external testimony stand for the fact that it is not
contrary to probability that the soul should again inhabit a body; after
that however, it is incumbent upon us to make a survey of the
inconsistencies of their position, and it will be easy thus, by means of
the consequences that arise as we follow out the consistent view, to
bring the truth to light. What, then, is to be said about these
theories? This that those who would have it that the soul migrates into
natures divergent from each other seem to me to obliterate all natural
distinctions; to blend and confuse together, in every possible respect,
the rational, the irrational, the sentient, and the insensate; if, that
is, all these are to pass into each other, with no distinct natural
order <span id="fr_1864"></span>[1866](#fn_1864.md) secluding them from
mutual transition. To say that one and the same soul, on account of a
particular environment of body, is at one time a rational and
intellectual soul, and that then it is caverned along with the reptiles,
or herds with the birds, or is a beast of burden, or a carnivorous one,
or swims in the deep; or even drops down to an insensate thing, so as to
strike out roots or become a complete tree, producing buds on branches,
and from those buds a flower, or a thorn, or a fruit edible or
noxious—to say this, is nothing short of making all things the same and
believing that one single nature runs through all beings; that there is
a connexion between them which blends and confuses hopelessly all the
marks by which one could be distinguished from another. The philosopher
who asserts that the same thing may be born in anything intends no less
than that all things are to be one; when the observed differences in
things are for him no obstacle to mixing together things which are
utterly incongruous. He makes it necessary that, even when one sees one
of the creatures that are venom-darting or carnivorous, one should
regard it, in spite of appearances, as of the same tribe, nay even of
the same family, as oneself. With such beliefs a man will look even upon
hemlock as not alien to his own nature, detecting, as he does, humanity
in the plant. The grape-bunch itself <span
id="fr_1865"></span>[1867](#fn_1865.md) , produced though it be by
cultivation for the purpose of sustaining life, he will not regard
without suspicion; for it too comes from a plant <span
id="fr_1866"></span>[1868](#fn_1866.md) : and we find even the fruit of the
ears of corn upon which we live are plants; how, then, can one put in
the sickle to cut them down; and how can one squeeze the bunch, or pull
up the thistle from the field, or gather flowers, or hunt birds, or set
fire to the logs of the funeral pyre: it being all the while <span
id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_455"></span>uncertain whether we are not laying
violent hands on kinsmen, or ancestors, or fellow-country-men, and
whether it is not through the medium of some body of theirs that the
fire is being kindled, and the cup mixed, and the food prepared? To
think that in the case of any single one of these things a soul of a man
has become a plant or animal <span id="fr_1867"></span>[1869](#fn_1867.md)
, while no marks are stamped upon them to indicate what sort of plant or
animal it is that has been a man, and what sort has sprung from other
beginnings,—such a conception as this will dispose him who has
entertained it to feel an equal amount of interest in everything: he
must perforce either harden himself against actual human beings who are
in the land of the living, or, if his nature inclines him to love his
kindred, he will feel alike towards every kind of life, whether he meet
it in reptiles or in wild beasts. Why, if the holder of such an opinion
go into a thicket of trees, even then he will regard the trees as a
crowd of men. What sort of life will his be, when he has to be tender
towards everything on the ground of kinship, or else hardened towards
mankind on account of his seeing no difference between them and the
other creatures? From what has been already said, then, we must reject
this theory: and there are many other considerations as well which on
the grounds of mere consistency lead us away from it. For I have heard
persons who hold these opinions <span
id="fr_1868"></span>[1870](#fn_1868.md) saying that whole nations of souls
are hidden away somewhere in a realm of their own, living a life
analogous to that of the embodied soul; but such is the fineness and
buoyancy of their substance that they themselves’ roll round along with
the revolution of the universe; and that these souls, having
individually lost their wings through some gravitation towards evil,
become embodied; first this takes place in men; and after that, passing
from a human life, owing to brutish affinities of their passions, they
are reduced <span id="fr_1869"></span>[1871](#fn_1869.md) to the level of
brutes; and, leaving that, drop down to this insensate life of pure
nature <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1872](#fn_1870.md) which you have been
hearing so much of; so that that inherently fine and buoyant thing that
the soul is first becomes weighted and downward tending in consequence
of some vice, and so migrates to a human body; then its reasoning powers
are extinguished, and it goes on living in some brute; and then even
this gift of sensation is withdrawn, and it changes into the insensate
plant life; but after that mounts up again by the same gradations until
it is restored to its place in heaven. Now this doctrine will at once be
found, even after a very cursory survey, to have no coherency with
itself. For, first, seeing that the soul is to be dragged down from its
life in heaven, on account of evil there, to the condition of a tree,
and is then from this point, on account of virtue exhibited there, to
return to heaven, their theory will be unable to decide which is to have
the preference, the life in heaven, or the life in the tree. A circle,
in fact, of the same sequences will be perpetually traversed, where the
soul, at whatever point it may be, has no resting-place. If it thus
lapses from the disembodied state to the embodied, and thence to the
insensate, and then springs back to the disembodied, an inextricable
confusion of good and evil must result in the minds of those who thus
teach. For the life in heaven will no more preserve its blessedness
(since evil can touch heaven’s denizens), than the life in trees will be
devoid of virtue (since it is from this, they say, that the rebound of
the soul towards the good begins, while from there it begins the evil
life again). Secondly <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1873](#fn_1871.md) ,
seeing that the soul as it moves round in heaven is there entangled with
evil and is in consequence dragged down to live in mere matter, from
whence, however, it is lifted again into its residence on high, it
follows that those philosophers establish the very contrary <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1874](#fn_1872.md) of their own views; they establish,
namely, that the life in matter is the purgation of evil, while that
undeviating revolution along with the stars <span
id="fr_1873"></span>[1875](#fn_1873.md) is the foundation and cause of evil
in every soul: if it is here that the soul by means of virtue grows its
wing and then soars upwards, and there that those wings by reason of
evil fall off, so that it descends and clings to this lower world and is
commingled with the grossness of material nature. But the untenableness
of this view does not stop even in this, <span id="page_456">p.
456</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_456"></span>namely, that it contains
assertions diametrically opposed to each other. Beyond this, their
fundamental conception <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1876](#fn_1874.md) itself
cannot stand secure on every side. They say, for instance, that a
heavenly nature is unchangeable. How then, can there be room for any
weakness in the unchangeable? If, again, a lower nature is subject to
infirmity, how in the midst of this infirmity can freedom from it be
achieved? They attempt to amalgamate two things that can never be joined
together: they descry strength in weakness, passionlessness in passion.
But even to this last view they are not faithful throughout; for they
bring home the soul from its material life to that very place whence
they had exiled it because of evil there, as though the life in that
place was quite safe and uncontaminated; apparently quite forgetting the
fact that the soul was weighted with evil *there*, before it plunged
down into this lower world. The blame thrown on the life here below, and
the praise of the things in heaven, are thus interchanged and reversed;
for that which was once blamed conducts in their opinion to the brighter
life, while that which was taken for the better state gives an impulse
to the soul’s propensity to evil. Expel, therefore, from amongst the
doctrines of the Faith all erroneous and shifting suppositions about
such matters! We must not follow, either, as though they had bit the
truth those who suppose that souls pass from women’s bodies to live in
men <span id="fr_1875"></span>[1877](#fn_1875.md) , or, reversely <span
id="fr_1876"></span>[1878](#fn_1876.md) , that souls that have parted with
men’s bodies exist in women: or even if they only say that they pass
from men into men, or from women into women. As for the former
theory <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1879](#fn_1877.md) , not only has it been
rejected for being shifting and illusory, and for landing us in opinions
diametrically opposed to each other; but it must be rejected also
because it is a godless theory, maintaining as it does that nothing
amongst the things in nature is brought into existence without deriving
its peculiar constitution from evil as its source. If, that is, neither
men nor plants nor cattle can be born unless some soul from above has
fallen into them, and if this fall is owing to some tendency to evil,
then they evidently think that evil controls the creation of all beings.
In some mysterious way, too, both events are to occur at once; the birth
of the man in consequence of a marriage, and the fall of the soul
(synchronizing as it must with the proceedings at that marriage). A
greater absurdity even than this is involved: if, as is the fact, the
large majority of the brute creation copulate in the spring, are we,
then, to say that the spring brings it about that evil is engendered in
the revolving world above, so that, at one and the same moment, *there*
certain souls are impregnated with evil and so fall, and *here* certain
brutes conceive? And what are we to say about the husbandman who sets
the vine-shoots in the soil? How does his hand manage to have covered in
a human soul along with the plant, and how does the moulting of wings
last simultaneously with his employment in planting? The same absurdity,
it is to be observed, exists in the other of the two theories as well;
in the direction, I mean, of thinking that the soul must be anxious
about the intercourses of those living in wedlock, and must be on the
look-out for the times of bringing forth, in order that it may insinuate
itself into the bodies then produced. Supposing the man refuses the
union, or the woman keeps herself clear of the necessity of becoming a
mother, will evil then fail to weigh down that particular soul? Will it
be marriage, in consequence, that sounds up above the first note of evil
in the soul, or will this reversed state invade the soul quite
independently of any marriage? But then, in this last case, the soul
will have to wander about in the interval like a houseless vagabond,
lapsed as it has from its heavenly surroundings, and yet, as it may
happen in some cases, still without a body to receive it. But how, after
that, can they imagine that the Deity exercises any superintendence over
the world, referring as they do the beginnings of human lives to this
casual and meaningless descent of a soul. For all that follows must
necessarily accord with the beginning; and so, if a life begins in
consequence of a chance accident, the whole course of it <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1880](#fn_1878.md) becomes at once a chapter of
accidents, and the attempt to make the whole world depend on a Divine
power is absurd, when it is made by these men, who deny to the
individualities in it a birth from the fiat of the Divine Will and refer
the several origins of beings to encounters that come of evil, as though
there could never have existed such a thing as a human life, unless a
vice had struck, as it were, its leading note. If the beginning is like
that, a sequel will most certainly be set in motion in accord<span
id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_457"></span>ance
with that beginning. None would dare to maintain that what is fair can
come out of what is foul, any more than from good can come its opposite.
We expect fruit in accordance with the nature of the seed. Therefore
this blind movement of chance is to rule the whole of life, and no
Providence is any more to pervade the world.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p222"></span>Nay, even the forecasting by our
calculations will be quite useless; virtue will lose its value; and to
turn from evil will not be worth the while. Everything will be entirely
under the control of the driver, Chance; and our lives will differ not
at all from vessels devoid of ballast, and will drift on waves of
unaccountable circumstances, now to this, now to that incident of good
or of evil. The treasures of virtue will never be found in those who owe
their constitution to causes quite contrary to virtue. If God really
superintends our life, then, confessedly, evil cannot begin it. But if
we do owe our birth to evil, then we must go on living in complete
uniformity with it. Thereby it will be shown that it is folly to talk
about the “houses of correction” which await us after this life is
ended, and the “just recompenses,” and all the other things there
asserted, and believed in too, that tend to the suppression of vice: for
how can a man, owing, as he does, his birth to evil, be outside its
pale? How can he, whose very nature has its rise in a vice, as they
assert, possess any deliberate impulse towards a life of virtue? Take
any single one of the brute creation; it does not attempt to speak like
a human being, but in using the natural kind of utterance sucked in, as
it were, with its mother’s milk <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1881](#fn_1879.md) , it deems it no loss to be
deprived of articulate speech. Just in the same way those who believe
that a vice was the origin and the cause of their being alive will never
bring themselves to have a longing after virtue, because it will be a
thing quite foreign to their nature. But, as a fact <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1882](#fn_1880.md) , they who by reflecting have
cleansed the vision of their soul do all of them desire and strive after
a life of virtue. Therefore it is by that fact clearly proved that vice
is not prior in time to the act of beginning to live, and that our
nature did not thence derive its source, but that the all-disposing
wisdom of God was the Cause of it: in short, that the soul issues on the
stage of life in the manner which is pleasing to its Creator, and then
(but not before), by virtue of its power of willing, is free to choose
that which is to its mind, and so, whatever it may wish to be, becomes
that very thing. We may understand this truth by the example of the
eyes. To see is their natural state; but to fail to see results to them
either from choice or from disease. This unnatural state may supervene
instead of the natural, either by wilful shutting of the eyes or by
deprivation of their sight through disease. With the like truth we may
assert that the soul derives its constitution from God, and that, as we
cannot conceive of any vice in Him, it is removed from any necessity of
being vicious; that nevertheless, though this is the condition in which
it came into being, it can be attracted of its own free will in a chosen
direction, either wilfully shutting its eyes to the Good, or letting
them be damaged <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1883](#fn_1881.md) by that
insidious foe whom we have taken home to live with us, and so passing
through life in the darkness of error; or, reversely, preserving
undimmed its sight of the Truth and keeping far away from all weaknesses
that could darken it.—But then some one will ask, “When and how did it
come into being?” Now as for the question, how any single thing came
into existence, we must banish it altogether from our discussion. Even
in the case of things which are quite within the grasp of our
understanding and of which we have sensible perception, it would be
impossible for the speculative reason <span
id="fr_1882"></span>[1884](#fn_1882.md) to grasp the “how” of the
production of the phenomenon; so much so, that even inspired and saintly
men have deemed such questions insoluble. For instance, the Apostle
says, “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God, so that things which are seen are not made of things which
do appear <span id="fr_1883"></span>[1885](#fn_1883.md) .” He would not, I
take it, have spoken like that, if he had thought that the question
could be settled by any efforts of the reasoning powers. While the
Apostle affirms that it is an object of his faith <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1886](#fn_1884.md) that it was by the will of God that
the world itself and all which is therein was framed (whatever this
“world” be that involves the idea of the whole visible and invisible
creation), he has on the other hand left out of the investigation the
“how” of this framing. Nor do I think that this point can ever be
reached by any inquirers. The question presents, on the face of it, many
insuperable difficulties. How, for instance, can a world of movement
come from one that is at rest? how from the simple and undimensional
that which shows dimension and compositeness? Did it come actually out
of the Supreme Being? But the fact that this world presents a difference
in kind to that Being militates against <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1887](#fn_1885.md) such a <span id="page_458">p.
458</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_458"></span>supposition. Did it then
come from some other quarter? Yet Faith <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1888](#fn_1886.md) can contemplate nothing as quite
outside the Divine Nature; for we should have to believe in two distinct
and separate Principles, if outside the Creative Cause we are to suppose
something else, which the Artificer, with all His skill, has to put
under contribution for the formative processes of the Universe. Since,
then, the Cause of all things is one, and one only, and yet the
existences produced by that Cause are not of the same nature as its
transcendent quality, an inconceivability of equal magnitude <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[1889](#fn_1887.md) arises in both our suppositions,
*i.e.* both that the creation comes straight out of the Divine Being,
and that the universe owes its existence to some cause other than Him;
for if created things are to be of the same nature as God, we must
consider Him to be invested with the properties belonging to His
creation; or else a world of matter, outside the circle of God’s
substance, and equal, on the score of the absence in it of all
beginning, to the eternity of the Self-existent One, will have to be
ranged against Him: and this is in fact what the followers of Manes, and
some of the Greek philosophers who held opinions of equal boldness with
his, did imagine; and they raised this imagination into a system. In
order, then, to avoid falling into either of these absurdities, which
the inquiry into the origin of things involves, let us, following the
example of the Apostle, leave the question of the “how” in each created
thing, without meddling with it at all, but merely observing
incidentally that the movement of God’s Will becomes at any moment that
He pleases a fact, and the intention becomes at once realized in
Nature <span id="fr_1888"></span>[1890](#fn_1888.md) ; for Omnipotence does
not leave the plans of its far-seeing skill in the state of
unsubstantial wishes: and the actualizing of a wish is Substance. In
short, the whole world of existing things falls into two divisions:
*i.e.* that of the intelligible, and that of the corporeal: and the
intelligible creation does not, to begin with, seem to be in any way at
variance with a spiritual Being, but on the contrary to verge closely
upon Him, exhibiting as it does that absence of tangible form and of
dimension which we rightly attribute to His transcendent nature. The
corporeal creation <span id="fr_1889"></span>[1891](#fn_1889.md) , on the
other hand, must certainly be classed amongst specialities that have
nothing in common with the Deity; and it does offer this supreme
difficulty to the Reason; namely, that the Reason cannot see *how* the
visible comes out of the invisible, *how* the hard solid comes out of
the intangible, *how* the finite comes out of the infinite, *how* that
which is circumscribed by certain proportions, where the idea of
quantity comes in, can come from that which has no size, no proportions,
and so on through each single circumstance of body. But even about this
we can say so much: *i.e.* that not one of those things which we
attribute to body is itself body; neither figure, nor colour, nor
weight, nor extension, nor quantity, nor any other qualifying notion
whatever; but every one of them is a category; it is the combination of
them all into a single whole that constitutes body. Seeing, then, that
these several qualifications which complete the particular body are
grasped by thought alone, and not by sense, and that the Deity is a
thinking being, what trouble can it be to such a thinking agent to
produce the thinkables whose mutual combination generates *for us* the
substance of that body? All this discussion, however, lies outside our
present business. The previous question was,—If some souls exist
anterior to their bodies, *when* and *how* do they come into existence?
and of this question <span id="fr_1890"></span>[1892](#fn_1890.md) , again,
the part about the *how,* has been left out of our examination and has
not been meddled with, as presenting impenetrable difficulties. There
remains the question of the *when* of the soul’s commencement of
existence: it follows immediately on that which we have already
discussed. For if we were to grant that the soul has lived previous to
its body <span id="fr_1891"></span>[1893](#fn_1891.md) in some place of
resort peculiar to itself, then we cannot avoid seeing some force in all
that fantastic teaching lately discussed, which would explain the soul’s
habitation of the body as a consequence of some vice. Again, on the
other hand, no one who can reflect will imagine an after-birth of the
soul, *i.e.* that it is younger than the moulding of the body; for every
one can see for himself that not one amongst all the things that are
inanimate or <span id="page_459">p. 459</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_459"></span>soulless possesses any power of motion or
of growth; whereas there is no question about that which is bred in the
uterus both growing and moving from place to place. It remains therefore
that we must think that the point of commencement of existence is one
and the same for body and soul. Also we affirm that, just as the earth
receives the sapling from the hands of the husbandman and makes a tree
of it, without itself imparting the power of growth to its nursling, but
only lending it, when placed within itself, the impulse to grow, in this
very same way that which is secreted from a man for the planting of a
man is itself to a certain extent a living being as much gifted with a
soul and as capable of nourishing itself as that from which it
comes <span id="fr_1892"></span>[1894](#fn_1892.md) . If this offshoot, in
its diminutiveness, cannot contain at first all the activities and the
movements of the soul, we need not be surprised; for neither in the seed
of corn is there visible all at once the ear. How indeed could anything
so large be crowded into so small a space? But the earth keeps on
feeding it with its congenial aliment, and so the grain becomes the ear,
without changing its nature while in the clod, but only developing it
and bringing it to perfection under the stimulus of that nourishment.
As, then, in the case of those growing seeds the advance to perfection
is a graduated one <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1895](#fn_1893.md) , so in
man’s formation the forces of his soul show themselves in proportion to
the size to which his body has attained. They dawn first in the fœtus,
in the shape of the power of nutrition and of development: after that,
they introduce into the organism that has come into the light the gift
of perception: then, when this is reached, they manifest a certain
measure of the reasoning faculty, like the fruit of some matured plant,
not growing all of it at once, but in a continuous progress along with
the shooting up of that plant. Seeing, then, that that which is secreted
from one living being to lay the foundations of another living being
cannot itself be dead (for a state of deadness arises from the privation
of life, and it cannot be that privation should precede the having), we
grasp from these considerations the fact that in the compound which
results from the joining of both (soul and body) there is a simultaneous
passage of both into existence; the one does not come first, any more
than the other comes after. But as to the number of souls, our reason
must necessarily contemplate a stopping some day of its increase; so
that Nature’s stream may not flow on for ever, pouring forward in her
successive births and never staying that onward movement. The reason for
our race having some day to come to a standstill is as follows, in our
opinion: since every intellectual reality is fixed in a plenitude of its
own, it is reasonable to expect that humanity <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1896](#fn_1894.md) also will arrive at a goal (for in
this respect also humanity is not to be parted from the intellectual
world <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1897](#fn_1895) .md); so that we are to
believe that it will not be visible for ever only in defect, as it is
now: for this continual addition of after generations indicates that
there is something deficient in our race.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p240"></span>Whenever, then, humanity shall have
reached the plenitude that belongs to it, this on-streaming movement of
production will altogether cease; it will have touched its destined
bourn, and a new order of things quite distinct from the present
precession of births and deaths will carry on the life of humanity. If
there is no birth, it follows necessarily that there will be nothing to
die. Composition must precede dissolution (and by composition I mean the
coming into this world by being born); necessarily, therefore, if this
synthesis does not precede, no dissolution will follow. Therefore, if we
are to go upon probabilities, the life after this is shown to us
beforehand as something that is fixed and imperishable, with no birth
and no decay to change it.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p241"></span>The Teacher finished her exposition; and
to the many persons sitting by her bedside the whole discussion seemed
now to have arrived at a fitting conclusion. Nevertheless, fearing that
if the Teacher’s illness took a fatal turn (such as did actually
happen), we should have no one amongst us to answer the objections of
the unbelievers to the Resurrection <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1898](#fn_1896.md) , I still insisted.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p243"></span>The argument has not yet touched the
most vital of all the questions relating to our Faith. I mean, that the
inspired Writings, both in the New and in the Old Testament, declare
most emphatically not only that, when our race has completed the ordered
chain of its existence as the ages lapse through their complete
circle <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1899](#fn_1897.md) , this current
streaming onward as generation succeeds generation will cease
altogether, but also that then, when the completed Universe no longer
admits of further increase, all the souls in their entire number will
come back out of their invisible and scattered condition into
tangibility and light, the identical <span id="page_460">p. 460</span>
<span id="x.iii.ii-Page_460"></span>atoms (belonging to each soul)
reassembling together in the same order as before; and this
reconstitution of human life is called, in these Writings which contain
God’s teaching, the Resurrection, the entire movement of the atoms
receiving the same term as the raising up of that which is actually
prostrate on the ground <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1900](#fn_1898.md) .

<span id="x.iii.ii-p246"></span>But, said she, which of these points has
been left unnoticed in what has been said?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p247"></span>Why, the actual doctrine of the
Resurrection, I replied.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p248"></span>And yet, she answered, much in our long
and detailed discussion pointed to that.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p249"></span>Then are you not aware, I insisted, of
all the objections, a very swarm of them, which our antagonists bring
against us in connection with that hope of yours?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p250"></span>And I at once tried to repeat all the
devices hit upon by their captious champions to upset the doctrine of
the Resurrection.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p251"></span>She, however, replied, First, I think,
we must briefly run over the scattered proclamations of this doctrine in
Holy Scripture; they shall give the finishing touch to our discourse.
Observe, then, that I can hear David, in the midst of his praises in the
Divine Songs, saying at the end of the hymnody of the [Psalm
104](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#000.md)<span id="x.iii.ii-p251.1"></span>,
where he has taken for his theme God’s administration of the world,
“Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall die, and return to
their dust: Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created:
and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.” He says that a power of the
Spirit which works in all vivifies the beings into whom it enters, and
deprives those whom He abandons of their life. Seeing, then, that the
dying is declared to occur at the Spirit’s departure, and the renewal of
these dead ones at His appearance, and seeing moreover that in the order
of the statement the death of those who are to be thus renewed comes
first, we hold that in these words that mystery of the Resurrection is
proclaimed to the Church, and that David in the spirit of prophecy
expressed this very gift which you are asking about. You will find this
same prophet in another place <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1901](#fn_1899.md)
also saying that “the God of the world, the Lord of everything that is,
hath showed Himself to us, that we may keep the Feast amongst the
decorators;” by that mention of “decoration” with boughs, he means the
Feast of Tabernacle-fixing, which, in accordance with Moses’ injunction,
has been observed from of old. That lawgiver, I take it, adopting a
prophet’s spirit, predicted therein things still to come; for though the
decoration was always going on it was never finished. The truth indeed
was foreshadowed under the type and riddle of those Feasts that were
always occurring, but the true Tabernacle-fixing was not yet come; and
on this account “the God and Lord of the whole world,” according to the
Prophet’s declaration, “hath showed Himself to us, that the
Tabernacle-fixing of this our tenement that has been dissolved may be
kept for human kind”; a material decoration, that is, may be begun again
by means of the concourse of our scattered atoms. For that word <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p252.8"></span>πυκασμὸς</span> in its
peculiar meaning signifies the Temple-circuit and the decoration which
completes it. Now this passage from the Psalms runs as follows: “God and
Lord hath showed Himself to us; keep the Feast amongst the decorators
even unto the horns of the altar;” and this seems to me to proclaim in
metaphors the fact that one single feast is to be kept by the whole
rational creation, and that in that assembly of the saints the inferiors
are to join the dance with their superiors. For in the case of the
fabric of that Temple which was the Type it was not allowed to all who
were on the outside of its circuit <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1902](#fn_1900.md) to come within, but everything that
was Gentile and alien was prohibited from entering; and of those,
further, who had entered, all were not equally privileged to advance
towards the centre; but only those who had consecrated themselves by a
holier manner of life, and by certain sprinklings; and, again, not every
one amongst these last might set foot within the interior of the Temple;
the priests alone had the right of entering within the Curtain, and that
only for the service of the sanctuary; while even to the priests the
darkened shrine of the Temple, where stood the beautiful Altar with its
jutting horns, was forbidden, except to one of them, who held the
highest office of the <span id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_461"></span>priesthood, and who once a year, on a
stated day, and unattended, passed within it, carrying an offering more
than usually sacred and mystical. Such being the differences in
connection with this Temple which you know of, it was clearly <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1903](#fn_1901.md) a representation and an imitation
of the condition of the spirit-world, the lesson taught by these
material observances being this, that it is not the whole of the
rational creation that can approach the temple of God, or, in other
words, the adoration of the Almighty; but that those who are led astray
by false persuasions are outside the precinct of the Deity; and that
from the number of those who by virtue of this adoration have been
preferred to the rest and admitted within it, some by reason of
sprinklings and purifications have still further privileges; and again
amongst these last those who have been consecrated priests have
privileges further still, even to being admitted to the mysteries of the
interior. And, that one may bring into still clearer light the meaning
of the allegory, we may understand the Word here as teaching this, that
amongst all the Powers endued with reason some have been fixed like a
Holy Altar in the inmost shrine of the Deity; and that again of these
last some jut forward like horns, for their eminence, and that around
them others are arranged first or second, according to a prescribed
sequence of rank; that the race of man, on the contrary, on account of
indwelling evil was excluded from the Divine precinct, but that purified
with lustral water it re-enters it; and, since all the further barriers
by which our sin has fenced us off from the things within the veil are
in the end to be taken down, whenever the time comes that the tabernacle
of our nature is as it were to be fixed up again in the Resurrection,
and all the inveterate corruption of sin has vanished from the world,
then a universal feast will be kept around the Deity by those who have
decorated themselves in the Resurrection; and one and the same banquet
will be spread for all, with no differences cutting off any rational
creature from an equal participation in it; for those who are now
excluded by reason of their sin will at last be admitted within the
Holiest places of God’s blessedness, and will bind themselves to the
horns of the Altar there, that is, to the most excellent of the
transcendental Powers. The Apostle says the same thing more plainly when
he indicates the final accord of the whole Universe with the Good:
“That” to Him “every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in
earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue should confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father”: instead of
the “horns,” speaking of that which is angelic and “in heaven,” and by
the other terms signifying ourselves, the creatures whom we think of
next to that; one festival of united voices shall occupy us all; that
festival shall be the confession and the recognition of the Being Who
truly Is. One might (she proceeded) select many other passages of Holy
Scripture to establish the doctrine of the Resurrection. For instance,
Ezekiel leaps in the spirit of prophecy over all the intervening time,
with its vast duration; he stands, by his powers of foresight, in the
actual moment of the Resurrection, and, as if he had really gazed on
what is still to come, brings it in his description before our eyes. He
saw a mighty plain <span id="fr_1902"></span>[1904](#fn_1902.md) , unfolded
to an endless distance before him, and vast heaps of bones upon it flung
at random, some this way, some that; and then under an impulse from God
these bones began to move and group themselves with their fellows that
they once owned, and adhere to the familiar sockets, and then clothe
themselves with muscle, flesh, and skin (which was the process called
“decorating” in the poetry of the Psalms); a Spirit in fact was giving
life and movement to everything that lay there. But as regards our
Apostle’s description of the wonders of the Resurrection, why should one
repeat it, seeing that it can easily be found and read? how, for
instance, “with a shout” and the “sound of trumpets” (in the language of
the Word) all dead and prostrate things shall be “changed <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1905](#fn_1903.md) in the twinkling of an eye” into
immortal beings. The expressions in the Gospels also I will pass over;
for their meaning is quite clear to every one; and our Lord does not
declare in word alone that the bodies of the dead shall be raised up
again; but He shows in action the Resurrection itself, making a
beginning of this work of wonder from things more within our reach and
less capable of being doubted. First, that is, He displays His
life-giving power in the case of the deadly forms of disease, and chases
those maladies by one word of command; then He raises a little girl just
dead; then He makes a young man, who is already being carried out, sit
up on his bier, and delivers him to his mother; after that He calls
forth from his tomb the four-days-dead and already decomposed Lazarus,
vivifying the prostrate body with His commanding voice; then after three
days He raises from the dead His own human body, pierced though it was
<span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_462"></span>with the nails and spear, and brings the
print of those nails and the spear-wound to witness to the Resurrection.
But I think that a detailed mention of these things is not necessary;
for no doubt about them lingers in the minds of those who have accepted
the written accounts of them.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p257"></span>But that, said I, was not the point in
question. Most of your hearers will assent to the fact that there will
some day be a Resurrection, and that man will be brought before the
incorruptible tribunal <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1906](#fn_1904.md) ; on
account both of the Scripture proofs, and also of our previous
examination of the question. But still the question remains <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1907](#fn_1905.md) : Is the state which we are to
expect to be like the present state of the body? Because if so, then, as
I was saying <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1908](#fn_1906.md) , men had better
avoid hoping for any Resurrection at all. For if our bodies are to be
restored to life again in the same sort of condition as they are in when
they cease to breathe, then all that man can look forward to in the
Resurrection is an unending calamity. For what spectacle is more piteous
than when in extreme old age our bodies shrivel up <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[1909](#fn_1907.md) and change into something repulsive
and hideous, with the flesh all wasted in the length of years, the skin
dried up about the bones till it is all in wrinkles, the muscles in a
spasmodic state from being no longer enriched with their natural
moisture, and the whole body consequently shrunk, the hands on either
side powerless to perform their natural work, shaken with an involuntary
trembling? What a sight again are the bodies of persons in a long
consumption! They differ from bare bones only in giving the appearance
of being covered with a worn-out veil of skin. What a sight too are
those of persons swollen with the disease of dropsy! What words could
describe the unsightly disfigurement of sufferers from leprosy <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1910](#fn_1908.md) ? Gradually over all their limbs
and organs of sensation rottenness spreads and devours them. What words
could describe that of persons who have been mutilated in earthquake,
battle, or by any other visitation, and live on in such a plight for a
long time before their natural deaths? Or of those who from an injury
have grown up from infancy with their limbs awry! What can one say of
them? What is one to think about the bodies of newborn infants who have
been either exposed, or strangled, or died a natural death, if they are
to be brought to life again just such as they were? Are they to continue
in that infantine state? What condition could be more miserable than
that? Or are they to come to the flower of their age? Well, but what
sort of milk has Nature got to suckle them again with? It comes then to
this: that, if our bodies are to live again in every respect the same as
before, this thing that we are expecting is simply a calamity; whereas
if they are not the same, the person raised up will be another than he
who died. If, for instance, a little boy was buried, but a grown man
rises again, or reversely, how can we say that the dead in his very self
is raised up, when he has had some one substituted for him by virtue of
this difference in age? Instead of the child, one sees a grown-up man.
Instead of the old man, one sees a person in his prime. In fact, instead
of the one person another entirely. The cripple is changed into the
able-bodied man; the consumptive sufferer into a man whose flesh is
firm; and so on of all possible cases, not to enumerate them for fear of
being prolix. If, then, the body will not come to life again just such
in its attributes as it was when it mingled with the earth, that dead
body will not rise again; but on the contrary the earth will be formed
into another man. How, then, will the Resurrection affect myself, when
instead of me some one else will come to life? Some one else, I say; for
how could I recognize myself when, instead of what was once myself, I
see some one not myself? It cannot really be I, unless it is in every
respect the same as myself. Suppose, for instance, in this life I had in
my memory the traits of some one; say he was bald, had prominent lips, a
somewhat flat nose, a fair complexion, grey eyes, white hair, wrinkled
skin; and then went to look for such an one, and met a young man with a
fine head of hair, an aquiline nose, a dark complexion, and in all other
respects quite different in his type of countenance; am I likely in
seeing the latter to think of the former? But why dwell longer on these
the less forcible objections to the Resurrection, and neglect the
strongest one of all? For who has not heard that human life is like a
stream, moving from birth to death at <span id="page_463">p. 463</span>
<span id="x.iii.ii-Page_463"></span>a certain rate of progress, and then
only ceasing from that progressive movement when it ceases also to
exist? This movement indeed is not one of spacial change; our bulk never
exceeds itself; but it makes this advance by means of internal
alteration; and as long as this alteration is that which its name
implies, it never remains at the same stage (from moment to moment); for
how can that which is being altered be kept in any sameness? The fire on
the wick, as far as appearance goes, certainly seems always the same,
the continuity of its movement giving it the look of being an
uninterrupted and self-centred whole; but in reality it is always
passing itself along and never remains the same; the moisture which is
extracted by the heat is burnt up and changed into smoke the moment it
has burst into flame and this alterative force effects the movement of
the flame, working by itself the change of the subject-matter into
smoke; just, then, as it is impossible for one who has touched that
flame twice on the same place, to touch twice the very same flame <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[1911](#fn_1909.md) (for the speed of the alteration is
too quick; it does not wait for that second touch, however rapidly it
may be effected; the flame is always fresh and new; it is always being
produced, always transmitting itself, never remaining at one and the
same place), a thing of the same kind is found to be the case with the
constitution of our body. There is influx and afflux going on in it in
an alterative progress until the moment that it ceases to live; as long
as it is living it has no stay; for it is either being replenished, or
it is discharging in vapour, or it is being kept in motion by both of
these processes combined. If, then, a particular man is not the same
even as he was yesterday <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1912](#fn_1910.md) ,
but is made different by this transmutation, when so be that the
Resurrection shall restore our body to life again, that single man will
become a crowd of human beings, so that with his rising again there will
be found the babe, the child, the boy, the youth, the man, the father,
the old man, and all the intermediate persons that he once was. But
further <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1913](#fn_1911.md) ; chastity and
profligacy are both carried on in the flesh; those also who endure the
most painful tortures for their religion, and those on the other hand
who shrink from such, both one class and the other reveal their
character in relation to fleshly sensations; how, then, can justice be
done at the Judgment <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1914](#fn_1912.md) ?

<span id="x.iii.ii-p267"></span>Or take the case of one and the same man
first sinning and then cleansing himself by repentance, and then, it
might so happen, relapsing into his sin; in such a case both the defiled
and the undefiled body alike undergoes a change, as his nature changes,
and neither of them continue to the end the same; which body, then, is
the profligate to be tortured in? In that which is stiffened with old
age and is near to death? But this is not the same as that which did the
sin. In that, then, which defiled itself by giving way to passion? But
where is the old man, in that case? This last, in fact, will not rise
again, and the Resurrection will not do a complete work; or else he will
rise, while the criminal will escape. Let me say something else also
from amongst the objections made by unbelievers to this doctrine. No
part, they urge, of the body is made by nature without a function. Some
parts, for instance, are the efficient causes within us of our being
alive; without them our life in the flesh could not possibly be carried
on; such are the heart, liver, brain, lungs, stomach, and the other
vitals; others are assigned to the activities of sensation; others to
those of handing and walking <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1915](#fn_1913.md)
; others are adapted for the transmission of a posterity. Now if the
life to come is to be in exactly the same circumstances as this, the
supposed change in us is reduced to nothing; but if the report is true,
as indeed it is, which represents marriage as forming no part of the
economy of that after-life, and eating and drinking as not then
preserving its continuance, what use will there be for the members of
our body, when we are no longer to expect in that existence any of the
activities for which our members now exist? If, for the sake of
marriage, there are now certain organs adapted for marriage, then,
whenever the latter ceases to be, we shall not need those organs: the
same may be said of the <span id="page_464">p. 464</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_464"></span>hands for working with, the feet for
running with, the mouth for taking food with, the teeth for grinding it
with, the organs of the stomach for digesting, the evacuating ducts for
getting rid of that which has become superfluous. When therefore, all
those operations will be no more how or wherefore will their instruments
exist? So that necessarily, if the things that are not going to
contribute in any way to that other life are not to surround the body,
none of the parts which at present constitute the body would <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1916](#fn_1914.md) exist either. That life <span
id="fr_1915"></span>[1917](#fn_1915.md) , then, will be carried on by other
instruments; and no one could call such a state of things a
Resurrection, where the particular members are no longer present in the
body, owing to their being useless to that life. But if on the other
hand our Resurrection will be represented in every one of these; then
the Author of the Resurrection will fashion things in us of no use and
advantage to that life. And yet we must believe, not only that there is
a Resurrection, but also that it will not be an absurdity. We must,
therefore, listen attentively to the explanation of this, so that, for
every part of this truth we may have its probability saved to the
last <span id="fr_1916"></span>[1918](#fn_1916.md) .

<span id="x.iii.ii-p272"></span>When I had finished, the Teacher thus
replied, You have attacked the doctrines connected with the Resurrection
with some spirit, in the way of rhetoric as it is called; you have
coursed round and round the truth with plausibly subversive arguments;
so much so, that those who have not very carefully considered this
mysterious truth might possibly be affected in their view of it by the
likelihood of those arguments, and might think that the difficulty
started against what has been advanced was not altogether beside the
point. But, she proceeded, the truth does not lie in these arguments,
even though we may find it impossible to give a rhetorical answer to
them, couched in equally strong language. The true explanation of all
these questions is still stored up in the hidden treasure-rooms of
Wisdom, and will not come to the light until that moment when we shall
be taught the mystery of the Resurrection by the reality of it; and then
there will be no more need of phrases to explain the things which we now
hope for. Just as many questions might be started for debate amongst
people sitting up at night as to the kind of thing that sunshine is, and
then the simple appearing of it in all its beauty would render any
verbal description superfluous, so every calculation that tries to
arrive conjecturally at the future state will be reduced to nothingness
by the object of our hopes, when it comes upon us. But since it is our
duty not to leave the arguments brought against us in any way
unexamined, we will expound the truth as to these points as follows.
First let us get a clear notion as to the scope of this doctrine; in
other words, what is the end that Holy Scripture has in view in
promulgating it and creating the belief in it. Well, to sketch the
outline of so vast a truth and to embrace it in a definition, we will
say that the Resurrection is “*the reconstitution of our nature in its
original form* <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1919](#fn_1917.md) .” But in that
form of life, of which God Himself was the Creator, it is reasonable to
believe that there was neither age nor infancy nor any of the sufferings
arising from our present various infirmities, nor any kind of bodily
affliction whatever. It is reasonable, I say, to believe that God was
the Creator of none of these things, but that man was a thing divine
before his humanity got within reach of the assault of evil; that then,
however, with the inroad of evil, all these afflictions also broke in
upon him. Accordingly a life that is free from evil is under no
necessity whatever of being passed amidst the things that result from
evil. It follows that when a man travels through ice he must get his
body chilled; or when he walks in a very hot sun that he must get his
skin darkened; but if he has kept clear of the one or the other, he
escapes these results entirely, both the darkening and the chilling; no
one, in fact, when a particular cause was removed, would be justified in
looking for the effect of that particular cause. Just so our nature,
becoming passional, had to encounter all the necessary results of a life
of passion: but when it shall have started back to that state of
passionless blessedness, it will no longer encounter the inevitable
results of evil tendencies. Seeing, then, that all the infusions of the
life of the brute into our nature were not in us before our humanity
descended through the touch of evil into passions, most certainly, when
we abandon those passions, we shall abandon all their visible results.
No one, therefore, will be justified in seeking in that other life for
the consequences in us of any passion. Just as if a man, who, clad in a
ragged tunic, has divested himself of the garb, feels no <span
id="page_465">p. 465</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_465"></span>more its
disgrace upon him, so we too, when we have cast off that dead unsightly
tunic made from the skins of brutes and put upon us (for I take the
“coats of skins” to mean that conformation belonging to a brute nature
with which we were clothed when we became familiar with passionate
indulgence), shall, along with the casting off of that tunic, fling from
us all the belongings that were round us of that skin of a brute; and
such accretions are sexual intercourse, conception, parturition,
impurities, suckling, feeding, evacuation, gradual growth to full size,
prime of life, old age, disease, and death. If that skin is no longer
round us, how can its resulting consequences be left behind within us?
It is folly, then, when we are to expect a different state of things in
the life to come, to object to the doctrine of the Resurrection on the
ground of something that has nothing to do with it. I mean, what has
thinness or corpulence, a state of consumption or of plethora, or any
other condition supervening in a nature that is ever in a flux, to do
with the other life, stranger as it is to any fleeting and transitory
passing such as that? One thing, and one thing only, is required for the
operation of the Resurrection; viz. that a man should have lived, by
being born; or, to use rather the Gospel words, that “a man should be
born <span id="fr_1918"></span>[1920](#fn_1918.md) into the world”; the
length or briefness of the life, the manner, this or that, of the death,
is an irrelevant subject of inquiry in connection with that operation.
Whatever instance we take, howsoever we suppose this to have been, it is
all the same; from these differences in life there arises no difficulty,
any more than any facility, with regard to the Resurrection. He who has
once begun to live must necessarily go on having once lived <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1921](#fn_1919.md) , after his intervening dissolution
in death has been repaired in the Resurrection.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p276"></span>As to the *how* and the *when* of his
dissolution, what do *they* matter to the Resurrection? Consideration of
such points belongs to another line of inquiry altogether. For instance,
a man may have lived in bodily comfort, or in affliction, virtuously or
viciously, renowned or disgraced; he may have passed his days miserably,
or happily. These and such-like results must be obtained from the length
of his life and the manner of his living; and to be able to pass a
judgment on the things done in his life, it will be necessary for the
judge to scrutinize his indulgences, as the case may be, or his losses,
or his disease, or his old age, or his prime, or his youth, or his
wealth, or his poverty: how well or ill a man, placed in either of
these, concluded his destined career; whether he was the recipient of
many blessings, or of many ills in a length of life; or tasted neither
of them at all, but ceased to live before his mental powers were formed.
But whenever the time come that God shall have brought our nature back
to the primal state of man, it will be useless to talk of such things
then, and to imagine that objections based upon such things can prove
God’s power to be impeded in arriving at His end. His end is one, and
one only; it is this: when the complete whole of our race shall have
been perfected from the first man to the last,—some having at once in
this life been cleansed from evil, others having afterwards in the
necessary periods been healed by the Fire, others having in their life
here been unconscious equally of good and of evil,—to offer to every one
of us participation in the blessings which are in Him, which, the
Scripture tells us, “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,” nor thought ever
reached. But this is nothing else, as I at least understand it, but to
be in God Himself; for the Good which is above hearing and eye and heart
must be that Good which transcends the universe. But the difference
between the virtuous and the vicious life led at the present time <span
id="fr_1920"></span>[1922](#fn_1920.md) will be illustrated in this way;
viz. in the quicker or more tardy participation of each in that promised
blessedness. According to the amount of the ingrained wickedness of each
will be computed the duration of his cure. This cure consists in the
cleansing of his soul, and that cannot be achieved without an
excruciating condition, as has been expounded in our previous
discussion. But any one would more fully comprehend the futility and
irrelevancy of all these objections by trying to fathom the depths of
our Apostle’s wisdom. When explaining this mystery to the Corinthians,
who, perhaps, themselves were bringing forward the same objections to it
as its impugners to-day bring forward to overthrow our faith, he
proceeds on his own authority to chide the audacity of their ignorance,
and speaks thus: “Thou wilt say, then, to me, How are the dead raised
up, and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest
is not quickened, except it die; And that which thou sowest, thou sowest
not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or
of some other grain; But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him.”
In that passage, as it seems to <span id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_466"></span>me, he gags the mouths of men who display
their ignorance of the fitting proportions in Nature, and who measure
the Divine power by their own strength, and think that only so much is
possible to God as the human understanding can take in, but that what is
beyond it surpasses also the Divine ability. For the man who had asked
the Apostle, “how are the dead raised up?” evidently implies that it is
impossible when once the body’s atoms have been scattered that they
should again come in concourse together; and this being impossible, and
no other possible form of body, besides that arising from such a
concourse, being left, he, after the fashion of clever
controversialists, concludes the truth of what he wants to prove, by a
species of syllogism, thus: If a body is a concourse of atoms, and a
second assemblage of these is impossible, what sort of body will those
get who rise again? This conclusion, involved seemingly in this artful
contrivance of premisses, the Apostle calls “folly,” as coming from men
who failed to perceive in other parts of the creation the masterliness
of the Divine power. For, omitting the sublimer miracles of God’s hand,
by which it would have been easy to place his hearer in a dilemma (for
instance he might have asked “how or whence comes a heavenly body, that
of the sun for example, or that of the moon, or that which is seen in
the constellations; whence the firmament, the air, water, the earth?”),
he, on the contrary, convicts the objectors of inconsiderateness by
means of objects which grow alongside of us and are very familiar to
all. “Does not even husbandry teach thee,” he asks, “that the man who in
calculating the transcendent powers of the Deity limits them by his own
is a fool?” Whence do seeds get the bodies that spring up from them?
What precedes this springing up? Is it not a death that precedes <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1923](#fn_1921.md) ? At least, if the dissolution of a
compacted whole is a death; for indeed it cannot be supposed that the
seed would spring up into a shoot unless it had been dissolved in the
soil, and so become spongy and porous to such an extent as to mingle its
own qualities with the adjacent moisture of the soil, and thus become
transformed into a root and shoot; not stopping even there, but changing
again into the stalk with its intervening knee-joints that gird it up
like so many clasps, to enable it to carry with figure erect the ear
with its load of corn. Where, then, were all these things belonging to
the grain before its dissolution in the soil? And yet this result sprang
from that grain; if that grain had not existed first, the ear would not
have arisen. Just, then, as the “body” of the ear comes to light out of
the seed, God’s artistic touch of power producing it all out of that
single thing, and just as it is neither entirely the same thing as that
seed nor something altogether different, so (she insisted) by these
miracles performed on seeds you may now interpret the mystery of the
Resurrection. The Divine power, in the superabundance of Omnipotence,
does not only restore you that body once dissolved, but makes great and
splendid additions to it, whereby the human being is furnished in a
manner still more magnificent.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p279"></span>“It is sown,” he says, “in corruption;
it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in
power: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown a
natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.” The grain of wheat, after
its dissolution in the soil, leaves behind the slightness of its bulk
and the peculiar quality of its shape, and yet it has not left and lost
itself, but, still self-centred, grows into the ear, though in many
points it has made an advance upon itself, viz. in size, in splendour,
in complexity, in form. In the same fashion the human being deposits in
death all those peculiar surroundings which it has acquired from
passionate propensities; dishonour, I mean, and corruption and weakness
and characteristics of age; and yet the human being does not lose
itself. It changes into an ear of corn as it were; into incorruption,
that is, and glory and honour and power and absolute perfection; into a
condition in which its life is no longer carried on in the ways peculiar
to mere nature, but has passed into a spiritual and passionless
existence. For it is the peculiarity of the natural body to be always
moving on a stream, to be always altering from its state for the moment
and changing into something else; but none of these processes, which we
observe <span id="page_467">p. 467</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_467"></span>not in man only but also in plants and
brutes will be found remaining in the life that shall be then. Further,
it seems to me that the words of the Apostle in every respect harmonize
with our own conception of what the Resurrection is. They indicate the
very same thing that we have embodied in our own definition of it,
wherein we said that the Resurrection is no other thing than “*the
re-constitution of our nature in its original form.*” For, whereas we
learn from Scripture in the account of the first Creation <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1924](#fn_1922.md) , that first the earth brought
forth “the green herb” (as the narrative says), and that then from this
plant seed was yielded, from which, when it was shed on the ground, the
same form of the original plant again sprang up, the Apostle, it is to
be observed, declares that this very same thing happens in the
Resurrection also; and so we learn from him the fact, not only <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1925](#fn_1923.md) that our humanity will be then
changed into something nobler, but also that what we have therein to
expect is nothing else than that which was at the beginning. In the
beginning, we see, it was not an ear rising from a grain, but a grain
coming from an ear, and, after that, the ear grows round the grain: and
so the order indicated in this similitude <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1926](#fn_1924.md) clearly shows that all that blessed
state, which arises for us by means of the Resurrection is only a return
to our pristine state of grace. We too, in fact, were once in a fashion
a full ear <span id="fr_1925"></span>[1927](#fn_1925.md) ; but the burning
heat of sin withered us up, and then on our dissolution by death the
earth received us: but in the spring of the Resurrection she will
reproduce this naked grain <span id="fr_1926"></span>[1928](#fn_1926.md) of
our body in the form of an ear, tall, well-proportioned, and erect,
reaching to the heights of heaven, and, for blade and beard, resplendent
in incorruption, and with all the other godlike marks. For “this
corruptible must put on incorruption”; and this incorruption and glory
and honour and power are those distinct and acknowledged marks of Deity
which once belonged to him who was created in God’s image, and which we
hope for hereafter. The first man Adam, that is, was the first ear; but
with the arrival of evil human nature was diminished into a mere
multitude <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1929](#fn_1927.md) ; and, as happens
to the grain <span id="fr_1928"></span>[1930](#fn_1928.md) on the ear, each
individual man was denuded of the beauty of that primal ear, and
mouldered in the soil: but in the Resurrection we are born again in our
original splendour; only instead of that single primitive ear we become
the countless myriads of ears in the cornfields. The virtuous life as
contrasted with that of vice is distinguished thus: those who while
living have by virtuous conduct exercised husbandry on themselves are at
once revealed in all the qualities of a perfect ear, while those whose
bare grain (that is the forces of their natural soul) has become through
evil habits degenerate, as it were, and hardened by the weather (as the
so-called “hornstruck” seeds <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1931](#fn_1929.md)
, according to the experts in such things, grow up), will, though they
live again in the Resurrection, experience very great severity from
their Judge, because they do not possess the strength to shoot up into
the full proportions of an ear, and thereby become that which we were
before our earthly fall <span id="fr_1930"></span>[1932](#fn_1930.md) . The
remedy offered by the Over<span id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span
id="x.iii.ii-Page_468"></span>seer of the produce is to collect together
the tares and the thorns, which have grown up with the good seed, and
into whose bastard life all the secret forces that once nourished its
root have passed, so that it not only has had to remain without its
nutriment, but has been choked and so rendered unproductive by this
unnatural growth. When from the nutritive part within them everything
that is the reverse or the counterfeit of it has been picked out, and
has been committed to the fire that consumes everything unnatural, and
so has disappeared, then in this class also their humanity will thrive
and will ripen into fruit-bearing, owing to such husbandry, and some day
after long courses of ages will get back again that universal form which
God stamped upon us at the beginning. Blessed are they, indeed, in whom
the full beauty of those ears shall be developed directly they are born
in the Resurrection. Yet we say this without implying that any merely
bodily distinctions will be manifest between those who have lived
virtuously and those who have lived viciously in this life, as if we
ought to think that one will be imperfect as regards his material frame,
while another will win perfection as regards it. The prisoner and the
free, here in this present world, are just alike as regards the
constitutions of their two bodies; though as regards enjoyment and
suffering the gulf is wide between them. In this way, I take it, should
we reckon the difference between the good and the bad in that
intervening time <span id="fr_1931"></span>[1933](#fn_1931.md) . For the
perfection of bodies that rise from that sowing of death is, as the
Apostle tells us, to consist in incorruption and glory and honour and
power; but any diminution in such excellences does not denote a
corresponding bodily mutilation of him who has risen again, but a
withdrawal and estrangement from each one of those things which are
conceived of as belonging to the good. Seeing, then, that one or the
other of these two diametrically opposed ideas, I mean good and evil,
must any way attach to us, it is clear that to say a man is not included
in the good is a necessary demonstration that he is included in the
evil. But then, in connection with evil, we find no honour, no glory, no
incorruption, no power; and so we are forced to dismiss all doubt that a
man who has nothing to do with these last-mentioned things must be
connected with their opposites, viz. with weakness, with dishonour, with
corruption, with everything of that nature, such as we spoke of in the
previous parts of the discussion, when we said how many were the
passions, sprung from evil, which are so hard for the soul to get rid
of, when they have infused themselves into the very substance of its
entire nature and become one with it. When such, then, have been purged
from it and utterly removed by the healing processes worked out by the
Fire, then every one of the things which make up our conception of the
good will come to take their place; incorruption, that is, and life, and
honour, and grace, and glory, and everything else that we conjecture is
to be seen in God, and in His Image, man as he was made.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p4"></span> Gregory himself tells us, in his life of
S. Macrina, that he went to see her after the Council of Antioch. (This
and Basil’s death occurred in the year 379: so that this Dialogue was
probably composed in 380.) “The interval during which the circumstances
of our times of trials prevented any visits had been long.” He goes on
to say (p. 189 B.); “And that she might cause me no depression of
spirits, she somehow subdued the noise and concealed the difficulty of
her breathing, and assumed perfect cheerfulness: she not only started
pleasant topics herself, but suggested them as well by the questions
which she asked. The conversation led naturally to the mention of our
great Basil. While my very soul sank and my countenance was saddened and
fell, she herself was so far from going with me into the depths of
mourning, that she made the mention of that saintly name all opportunity
for the most sublime philosophy. Examining human nature in a scientific
way, disclosing the divine plan that underlies all afflictions, and
dealing, as if inspired by the Holy Spirit, with all the questions
relating to a future life, she maintained such a discourse that my soul
seemed to be lifted along with her words almost beyond the compass of
humanity, and, as I followed her argument, to be placed within the
sanctuary of heaven.” Again (p. 190 B): “And if my tract would not
thereby be extended to an endless length, I would have reported
everything in its order; *i.e.* how her argument lifted her as she went
into the philosophy both of the soul, and of the causes of our life in
the flesh, and of the final cause of Man and his mortality, and of death
and the return thence into life again. In all of it her reasoning
continued clear and consecutive: it flowed on so easily and naturally
that it was like the water from some spring falling unimpeded
downwards.”

<span id="fn_1746"></span>[430:1748](2050215.htm#fr_1746.md) <span
id="x.iii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p6"></span> Two grounds are here given why this
practice of grief for the departed is difficult to give up. One lies in
the natural abhorrence of death, showing itself in two ways, viz. in our
grief over others dying, and in recoiling from our own death, expressed
by two evenly balanced sentences, <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p6.1"></span>οὔτε τῶν ὁρώντων</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p6.2"></span>…</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p6.3"></span>οἷς τε ἄν</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p6.4"></span>…</span>; in the latter a
second <span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p6.5"></span>οὔτε</span>
might have been expected; but such an anacoluthon is frequent in
dialogue. Oehler is wrong in giving to the second <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p6.6"></span>τε</span> an intensive
force, *i.e.* “much more.” The other ground lies in the attitude of the
law towards death.

<span id="fn_1747"></span>[430:1749](2050215.htm#fr_1747.md) <span
id="x.iii.ii-p6.7"></span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p7"></span> Reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p7.1"></span>περιέχοντι</span>: the same word is used
below, “as long as the breath within was held in by the enveloping
substance”(see p. 432, note 8). Here it means “the air”: as in Marcus
Antoninus, Lib. iv. 39.

<span id="fn_1748"></span>[431:1750](2050215.htm#fr_1748.md) <span
id="x.iii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p11"></span> Reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p11.1"></span>κατασείσασα τῇ χειρὶ</span>, instead of the
vox nihili <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p11.2"></span>μετασείσασα</span> of the two Paris Editions,
which can be accounted for by <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p11.3"></span>μετα</span> being repeated in error from
<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p11.4"></span>μεταξυ</span>. The
question which this gesture accompanied is one to which it would be very
appropriate. The reading adopted is that of the Codex Uffenbach, and
this phrase, <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p11.5"></span>κατασείειν τῇ χειρὶ</span>, is unimpeachable
for “commanding silence,” being used by Polybius, and Xenophon (without
<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p11.6"></span>χειρὶ</span>). Wolf
and Krabinger prefer this reading to that of most of the Codd., <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p11.7"></span>κατασιγήσασα</span>: and
doubtless Sifanus read it (“manu silentio imperato”).

<span id="fn_1749"></span>[431:1751](2050215.htm#fr_1749.md) <span

id="x.iii.ii-p18.2"></span>ντιπιπτόντων πρὸς τὸν σκοπὸν τοῦτον
ὑποκληθέντων</span>: the reading of the Parisian Editions. But the
preponderance of <span class="c22"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p18.3"></span>ms.</span> authority is in favour of <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p18.4"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p18.5"></span>πεκλυθέντων</span>, “si
quæ ad hoc propositum opponuntur soluta fuerint,” Krabinger. The force
of <span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p18.6"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p18.7"></span>πὸ</span> will then be
“by way of rejoinder.” The idea in <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p18.8"></span>σκοπὸν</span> seems to be that of a butt set
up to be shot at. All the <span class="c22"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p18.9"></span>mss.</span> but not the Paris Editions, have
the article before <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p18.10"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p18.11"></span>ντιπιπτότων</span>: but it is not absolutely
necessary, for Gregory not unfrequently omits it before participles,
when his meaning is general, *i.e.* “Everything that,” &c.

<span id="fn_1751"></span>[432:1753](2050215.htm#fr_1751.md) <span
id="x.iii.ii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p21"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

id="x.iii.ii-p21.2"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p21.3"></span>τυχαία, κ.τ.λ</span>. It is better to connect
this directly with Epicurus himself, than to refer it, by bracketing the
preceding sentence (with Oehler), to his followers. Macrina infers from
the opinions known to her of Epicurus, what he must have said about the
human soul: *i.e.* that it was a bubble; and then what his followers
probably said. There is no evidence that Epicurus used this actual
figure: still Gregory *may* be recording his very words.—Lucian
(*Charon,* 68) enlarges on such a simile: and his <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p21.4"></span>ὠ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p21.5"></span>κύμορον φύσημα</span>, as
a description of man, is reproduced by Gregory himself in *Orat. de
Beatitud.* p. 768 D.

<span id="fn_1752"></span>[432:1754](2050215.htm#fr_1752.md) <span
id="x.iii.ii-p21.6"></span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p22"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p22.1"></span>τῷ περιέχοντι</span>. Sifanus takes this of
the surrounding atmosphere. So also Krabinger, “aere circumfuso,” just
as above (182 A.) it does certainly mean the air, and Wolf quotes a
passage to that effect from Marcus Antoninus and the present instance
also. Still there is no reason that it should not here mean the body of
the man, which is as it were a case retentive of the vital breath
within; and the sense seems to require it. As to the construction,
although <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p22.2"></span>πομφόλυξ</span> is sometimes masculine in
later Greek, yet it is much more likely that <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p22.3"></span>περιταθέντος</span> (not <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p22.4"></span>περιτεθέντος</span> of
the Paris Editt.) is the genitive absolute with <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p22.5"></span>τοῦ σώματος: τῶ
περιέχοντι</span> would then very naturally refer to this.

<span id="fn_1753"></span>[432:1755](2050215.htm#fr_1753.md) <span
id="x.iii.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p25"></span> But Dr. Hermann Schmidt sees even more
than this in this bold figure. The Creation preaches, as it were, and
its tones are first heard in our hearts (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p25.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p25.2"></span>νηχοῦντος τῇ καρδιᾷ</span>): and these tones
are then reflected back from the heart to the contemplating eye, which
thus becomes not a seeing only, but a hearing (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p25.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p25.4"></span>κροατὴς γίνεται</span>) organ, in its
external activity.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p36"></span> It may be noticed that besides the

<span id="x.iii.ii-p37"></span> Krabinger’s Latin “in intentione,”
though a literal translation, hardly represents the full force of this
passage, which is interesting because, the terms being used specially,
if not only, of fevers or inflammation, it is evident that the speaker
has her own illness in mind, and her words are thus more natural than if
she spoke of patients generally. If <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p37.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p37.2"></span>ν ἐπίτασει</span> is translated “at its

order of those which manifest themselves <span class="Greek"><span

which do so <span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p37.9"></span>δι᾽

force as in <span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p37.13"></span>τὸ ἐν

partitive genitive after <span class="Greek"><span

and this is perhaps the best way of taking it. But still, as Schmidt
points out, it is rather the human body than the elements themselves
that ought here to be spoken of as the efficient cause of thought: and
so he would either refer <span class="Greek"><span

passage from Plotinus: “Who could picture to himself evil as a specific
thing, appearing as it does only in the absence of each good?…it will be
necessary for all who are to know what evil is to have a clear
conception about good: since even in dealing with real species the
better take precedence of the worse; and evil is not even a species, but
rather a negation.” Cf. Origen, *In Johan*. p. 66 A, <span

The fact of the continuity of the soul was there deduced from its being
incomposite. So that the <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p64.1"></span>γὰρ</span> here does not give the ground for
the statement immediately preceding.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p65"></span>Gregory (p. 431) had suggested two
alternatives:—1. That the soul dissolves with the body. This is answered
by the soul’s “incompositeness.” 2. That the union of the immaterial
soul with the still material atoms after death cannot be maintained.
This is answered by the analogy given in the present section, of God’s
presence in an uncongenial universe, and that of the soul in the still
living body. The <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p65.1"></span>γὰρ</span> therefore refers to the answer to
1, without which the question of the soul continuing in the atoms could
not have been discussed at all.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p67"></span> *her vessel.* Of course this is not the
“vehicle” of the soul (after death) which the later Platonists speak of,

id="x.iii.ii-p67.2"></span>χημα</span> is used in connection with a
ship, Soph. *Trach.* 656; and though in Plato (*Timæus,* p. 69), whose
use of this word for the body was afterwards followed, it is not clear
whether a car or a ship is most thought of, yet that the latter is
Gregory’s meaning appears from his next words.

(middle) transitively, *e.g.* 202 C, 203 A, C, 208 B, and above, 189 A,
so that it is possible that we have here, in the passive form, a
deponent (transitive) perfect; moreover the sense seems to require it.
Gregory objects that in what has been said *all* the powers which
analysis finds in the soul have not been set forth with sufficient
fulness: an *exhaustive* account of them has not been given; and he
immediately proceeds to name other <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p73.5"></span>δυνάμεις</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p73.6"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p73.7"></span>νέργειαι</span> which have not been taken
into consideration. That this view of the passage is correct is further
shown by 202 C, where, the present objection having been treated at
length, it is concluded that there is no real ground for quarrelling
with the definition of soul <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="x.iii.ii-p74"></span> The syllogism implied in the following
words is this:—

<span id="x.iii.ii-p75"></span>The emotions are something intellectual
(because incorporeal).

<span id="x.iii.ii-p76"></span>Therefore the emotions are soul (or
souls).

<span id="x.iii.ii-p77"></span>This conclusion is obviously false;
logically, by reason of the fallacy of “the undistributed middle”;
ontologically, because it requires a false premise additional (*i.e.*
“everything intellectual is soul”) to make it true. Macrina directly
after this piece of bad logic deprecates the use of the syllogism. Is
this accidental? It looks almost like an excuse for not going into
technicalities and exposing this fallacy, which she has detected in her
opponent’s statement. Macrina actually answers as if Gregory had urged
his objection thus. “The emotions are not purely intellectual, but are
conditioned by the bodily organism: but they do belong to the expression
and the substance of the soul: the soul therefore is dependent on the
organism and will perish along with it.”

<span id="x.iii.ii-p82"></span> *that the soul was mortal.* Aristotle,
guided only by probabilities as discoverable by the syllogism, does
indeed define the soul, “*the first entelechy of a physical, potentially
living, and organic body.*” Entelechy is more than mere potentiality: it
is “developed force” (“dormant activity;” see W. Archer Butler’s
*Lectures*, ii. p. 393), capable of manifestation. The human soul,
uniting in itself all the faculties of the other orders of animate
existence, is a Microcosm. The other parts of the soul are inseparable
from the body, and are hence perishable (*De Animâ,* ii. 2); but the
<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p82.1"></span>νοῦς</span> exists
before the body, into which it enters from without as something divine
and immortal (*De Gen. Animal.* ii. 3). But he makes a distinction
between the form-receiving, and the form-giving <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p82.2"></span>νοῦς</span>: substantial
eternal existence belongs only to the latter (*De Animâ,* iii. 5). The
secret of the difference between him and Plato, with whom “all the soul
is immortal” (*Phædrus,* p. 245 C), lies in this; that Plato regarded
the soul as always in motion, while Aristotle denied it, in itself, any
motion at all. “It is one of the things that are impossible that motion
should exist in it” (*De Animâ,* i. 4). It cannot be moved at all;
therefore it cannot move itself. Plotinus and Porphyry, as well as
Nemesius the Platonizing Bishop of Emesa (whose treatise *De Animâ* is
wrongly attributed to Gregory), attacked this teaching of an
“entelechy.” Cf. also Justin Martyr (*ad Græc. cohort*, c. 6, p. 12);
“Plato declares that all the soul is immortal; Aristotle calls her an
‘entelechy,’ and not immortal. The one says she is ever-moving, the
other that she is never-moving, but prior to all motion.” Also Gregory
Naz., *Orat.* xxvii. “Away with Aristotle’s calculating Providence, and
his art of logic, and his dead reasonings about the soul, and purely
human doctrine!”

soul in everything that grows, even in the embryo, and just this very

(<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p91.1"></span>νόημα</span>) is
Krabinger’s reading: but Oehler reads from his Codd. <span

Schmidt suggests <span class="Greek"><span

other such-like emotion of the soul.”

<span id="x.iii.ii-p92"></span> *have some relation to the soul, and yet
they are not the soul.* Macrina does not mean that the Passions are
altogether severed from the soul, as the following shows: and so Oehler
cannot be right in reading and translating “Das Alles hat nichts mir der
Seele zu schaffen.” The Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p92.1"></span>περὶ τὴν ψυχὴν</span> is to be parallelled by
<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p92.2"></span>οἱ περὶ τὸν
Περικλέα</span>, “Pericles’ belongings,” or “party”; passing, in later
Greek, almost into “Pericles himself.”

remarks rightly that Krabinger’s translation is here incorrect:
“quæcunque autem in animæ confinio posita sunt”; and that <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p96.3"></span>τῆς ψυχῆς</span> should
on the contrary be joined closely to <span class="Greek"><span

elements which lie in, and on the confines of the soul, but between the
divine and adventitious elements *within* the soul: <span

refers therefore to “good and bad,” below.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p97"></span> This is no contradiction of the passage
above about Moses: there it was stated that the Passions did not belong
to the *essence* (<span class="Greek"><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p98.3"></span>λόγος</span> with
some reserve. “We do not lay it down ex cathedrâ, we put it forward as
open to challenge and discussion as we might do in the schools (<span

id="x.iii.ii-p98.7"></span>διαφύγοι</span> as a pure optative. Gregory
appears in his answer to congratulate her on the success of this
“exercise.” “To any one that reflects…your exposition…bears sufficiently
upon it the stamp of correctness, and hits the truth.” But he
immediately asks for Scripture authority. So that this <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p98.8"></span>λόγος</span>, though it
refers to Genesis, is not yet based upon Scripture. It is a
“consecutive” and consistent account of human nature: but it is
virtually identical with that advanced at the end of Book I. of
Aristotle’s *Ethics.* It is a piece of secular theorizing. The sneers of
cavillers may well be deprecated. Consistent, however, with this view of
the <span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p98.9"></span>λόγος</span>
here offered by Macrina, there is another possible meaning in <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p98.10"></span>ὡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p98.11"></span>ς</span> <span

possible care and circumspection, as if we were disputing in the
schools; so that cavillers may have nothing to find fault with”: <span

class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p98.14"></span>ς</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p98.15"></span>ἂν</span> expressing
purpose, not a wish. The cavillers will thus refer to sticklers for
Greek method and metaphysics: and Gregory’s congratulation of his
sister’s lucidity and grasp of the truth will be all the more
significant.

terror, caution; fear, obedience; hatred, aversion from vice; the power
of love, the desire for what is truly beautiful, &c.” Just below, the
allusion is to Plato’s charioteer, *Phædrus*, p. 253 C, and the old

Hom. Opif.* c. 17, “the sublime angelic lot”), and is a Platonic word.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p125"></span> *from those evil spirits.* So *Great
Catechism*, c. 26 (fin.). Here too Gregory follows Origen (*c. Cels*.
vi. 44), who declares that the Powers of evil are for a purpose (in
answer to Celsus’ objection that the Devil himself, instead of humanity,
ought to have been punished). “Now it is a thing which can in no way
cause surprise, that the Almighty, Who knows how to use wicked apostates
for His own purposes, should assign to such a certain place in the
universe, and should thus open an arena, as it were, of virtue, for
those to contend in who wish to “strive lawfully” for her prize: those
wicked ones were to try them, as the fire tries the gold, that, having
done their utmost to prevent the admission of any alloy into their
spiritual nature, and having proved themselves worthy to mount to
heaven, they might be drawn by the bands of the Word to the highest
blessedness and the summit of all Good.” These Powers, as reasoning
beings, shall then themselves be “mastered by the Word.” See *c. Cels.*
viii. 72.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p127"></span> The conclusion of which was drawn, 199
C. “Therefore the soul exists in the actual atoms which she has once
animated, and there is no force to tear her away from her cohesion with
them.” It is to the line of reasoning (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p127.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p127.2"></span>κολουθία</span>) leading up to this
conclusion that Gregory would revert, in order to question this
conclusion. What both sides are agreed on is, the existence merely of
the soul after death. All between this conclusion and the present break
in the discussion has been a digression on the Passions and on Hades.
Now Gregory asks, how can the soul possibly recognize the atoms that
once belonged to her? Oehler therefore does not translate aright, “ich
bitte nur den geführten Beweis…in derselben Folge zu wiederholen:” but
Krabinger expresses the true sense, “ut rursus mihi ad eandem
consequentiam reducatur oratio,” *i.e.* the discussion (not the proof),
which is here again, almost in Platonic fashion, personified.

<span id="fn_1816"></span>[445:1818](2050215.htm#fr_1816.md) <span

<span id="x.iii.ii-p130"></span> *tint*, <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p130.1"></span>μορφῆς</span>. Certainly in earlier Greek
<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p130.2"></span>μορφὴ</span> is
strictly used of “form,” “shape” (or the beauty of it) only, and colours
cannot be said to be mixed in imitation of form. It seems we have here a
late use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p130.3"></span>μορφὴ</span> as = “outward appearance”; so
that we may even speak of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p130.4"></span>μορφὴ</span> of a colour, or combinations of
colours. So (214 A) the painter “works up (on his palette) a particular
tint of colour” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p130.5"></span>μορφὴν</span>). Here it is the particular
hue, in person or picture, which it is desired to imitate. Akin to this
question is that of the proper translation of <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p130.6"></span>πρὸς τὴν ὁμοιότητα τοῦ προκειμένου</span>,
which Sifanus and Krabinger translate “ad similitudinem *argumenti,*”
and which may either mean (1) “to make the analogy to the subject matter
of our question as perfect as possible,” *i.e.* as a parenthesis, or (2)
“in imitation of the thing or colour (lying before the painter) to be
copied.” The last seems preferable (“to form the given tint”).

<span id="x.iii.ii-p152"></span> *her soaring.* Plato first spoke
(*Phædrus*, p. 248 C) of “that growth of wing, by which the soul is
lifted.” Once these natural wings can get expanded, her flight upwards
is a matter of course. This image is reproduced by Plotinus p. 769 A
(end of *Enneads*); Libanius, *Pro Socrate*, p. 258; Synesius, *De
Providentiâ,* p. 90 D, and *Hymn* i. III, where he speaks of the <span

class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p152.2"></span>λμα κοῦφον</span> of the
soul, and *Hymn* iii. 42. But there is mixed here with the idea of a

id="x.iii.ii-p152.4"></span>ναδρομὴ</span>), that of the running-ground

<span id="x.iii.ii-p154"></span> *shadowy phantoms of the departed are
often seen.* Cf. Origen *c. Cels.* ii. 60 (in answer to Celsus’
“Epicurean” opinion that ghosts are pure illusion): “He who does believe
this (*i.e.* in ghosts) necessarily believes in the immortality, or at
all events the long continuance of the soul: as Plato does in his
treatise on the soul (*i.e.* the *Phædo*) when he says that the shadowy
apparitions of the dead hover round their tombs. These apparitions,
then, have some substance: it is the so-called ‘radiant’ frame in which
the soul exists. But Celsus, not liking this, would have us believe that
people have waking dreams and ‘imagine as true, in accordance with their
wishes, a wild piece of unreality.’ In sleep we may well believe that
this is the case: not so in waking hours, unless some one is quite out
of his senses, or is melancholy mad.” But Origen here quotes Plato in
connection with the reality of the Resurrection body of Christ: Gregory
refers to ghosts only, with regard to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p154.1"></span>φιλοσώματοι</span>, whose whole condition
after death he represents very much in Plato’s words. See *Phædo*, p. 81

<span id="x.iii.ii-p170"></span> *the insolence of satiety cannot
touch.* Krabinger quotes from two of his Codd. a scholium to this
effect: “Then this proves to be nonsense what Origen has imagined about
the satiety of minds, and their consequent fall and recall, on which he
bases his notorious teaching about the pre-existence and restoration of
souls that are always revolving in endless motion, determined as he is,
like a retailer of evil, to mingle the Grecian myths with the Church’s
truth.” Gregory, more sober in his idealism, certainly does not follow
on this point his great Master. The phrase <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p170.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p170.2"></span>βριστὴς κόρος</span> is used by Gregory Naz.
also in his *Poems* (p. 32 A), and may have been suggested to both by
some poet, now lost. “Familiarity breeds contempt” is the modern
equivalent.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p172"></span> *by the nails of propension.* This
metaphor is frequently used by Gregory. Cf. *De Virginit.* c. 5: “How
can the soul which is riveted (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p172.1"></span>προσηλωθεῖσα</span>) to the pleasures of the
flesh, and busied with merely human longings, turn a disengaged eye upon
its kindred intellectual light?” So *De Beatitud.* Or. viii. (I. p.
833), &c.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p184"></span> *a state which owns no master and is
self-regulating*, &c. He repeats this, *De Hom. Opif.* c. 4: “For the
soul immediately shows its royal and exalted character, far removed from
the lowliness of private station, in that it owns no master, and is
self-governed, swayed autocratically by its own will,—for to whom else
does this belong than to a king?” and c. 16: “Thus, there is in us the
principle of all excellence, all virtue, and every higher thing that we
conceive: but pre-eminent among all is the fact that we are free from
necessity, and not in bondage to any natural force, but have decision in
our power as we please: for virtue is a voluntary thing, subject to no
dominion:” and *Orat. Catech.* c. 5: “Was it not, then, most right that
that which is in every detail made like the Divine should possess in its
nature a self-ruling and independent principle, such as to enable the
participation of the good to be the reward of its virtue?” It would be
possible to quote similar language from the Neoplatonists (e.g. Plotinus
vi. 83–6): but Gregory learnt the whole bearing and meaning of moral
liberty from none but Origen, whose so-called “heresies” all flowed from
his constant insistence on its reality.

28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028)<span id="x.iii.ii-p185.2"></span>.md)
is a text much handled by the earlier Greek Fathers. Origen especially
has made it one of the Scripture foundations upon which he has built up
theology. This passage in Gregory should be compared with the following
in Origen, *c. Cels*. iv. 69, where he has been speaking of evil and its
origin, and its disappearance: “God checks the wider spread of evil, and
banishes it altogether in a way that is conducive to the good of the
whole. Whether or not there is reason to believe that after the
banishment of evil it will again appear is a separate question. By later
corrections, then, God does put right some defects: for although in the
creation of the whole all the work was fair and strong, nevertheless a
certain healing process is needed for those whom evil has infected, and
for the world itself which it has as it were tainted; and God is never
negligent in interfering on certain occasions in a way suitable to a
changeful and alterable world,” &c. “He is like a husbandman performing
different work at different times upon the land, for a final harvest.”
Also viii. 72: “This subject requires much study and demonstration:
still a few things must and shall be said at once tending to show that
it is not only possible, but an actual truth, that every being that
reasons ‘shall agree in one law’ (quoting Celsus’ words). Now while the
Stoics hold that when the strongest of the elements has by its nature
prevailed over the rest, there shall be the Conflagration, when all
things will fall into the fire, we hold that the Word shall some day
master the whole of ‘reasoning nature,’ and shall transfigure it to its
own perfection, when each with pure spontaneity shall will what it
wishes, and act what it wills. We hold that there is no analogy to be
drawn from the case of bodily diseases, and wounds, where some things
are beyond the power of any art of healing. We do not hold that there
are any of the results of sin which the universal Word, and the
universal God, cannot heal. The healing power of the Word is greater
than any of the maladies of the soul, and, *according to the will*, He
does draw it to Himself: and so the aim of things is that evil should be
annihilated: whether with no possibility whatever of the soul ever
turning to it again, is foreign to the present discussion. It is
sufficient now to quote Zephaniah” ([Zeph.
3.7-13](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007.md)<span

<span id="x.iii.ii-p186"></span> But, when A. Jahn, as quoted by
Krabinger asserts that Gregory and Origen derived their denial of the
eternity of punishment from a source “merely extraneous,” *i.e.* the
Platonists, we must not forget that Plato himself in the *Phædo*, 113 F
(cf. also *Gorgias,* 525 C, and *Republic,* x. 615), expressly teaches
the eternity of punishment hereafter, for he uses there not the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p186.1"></span>αἰ& 240·ν</span>
or <span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p186.2"></span>αἰωνίος</span>,

<span id="x.iii.ii-p190"></span> *Such are the wonders.* There is here,
Denys (*De la Philosophie d’Origène,* p. 484) remarks, a great
difference between Gregory and Origen. Both speak of an “eternal
sabbath,” which will end the circle of our destinies. But Origen, after
all the progress and peregrinations of the soul, which he loves to
describe, establishes “the reasoning nature” at last in an unchangeable
quiet and repose; while Gregory sets before the soul an endless career
of perfections and ever increasing happiness. This is owing to their
different conceptions of the Deity. Origen cannot understand how He can
know Himself or be accessible to our thought, if He is Infinite: Gregory
on the contrary conceives Him as Infinite, as beyond all real or
imaginable boundaries, <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p190.1"></span>πασῆς περιγραφῆς ἐκτός</span> (*Orat. Cat*.
viii. 65); this is the modern, rather than the Greek view. In the
following description of the life eternal Gregory hardly merits the
censure of Ritter that he “introduces absurdity” into it.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p205"></span> *some extend this absurdity even to
trees:* Empedocles for instance. Cf. *Philosophumena* (of Hippolytus,
falsely attributed to Origen), p. 50, where two lines of his are quoted.
Chrysostom’s words (I. iv. p. 196), “There are those amongst them who
carry souls into plants, into shrubs, and into dogs,” are taken by
Matthæus to refer to Empedocles. Cf. Celsus also (quoted in Origen, *c.
Cels.* viii. 53), “Seeing then men are born bound to a body—no matter
whether the economy of the world required this, or that they are paying
the penalty for some sin, or that the soul is weighted with certain
emotions till it is purified from them at the end of its destined cycle,
three myriad hours, according to Empedocles, being the necessary period
of its wanderings far away from the Blessed Ones, during which it passes
successively into every perishable shape—we must believe any way that
there exist certain guardians of this prison-house.” See *De Hom. Opif.*
c. 28. Empedocles can be no other, then, than “the philosopher who
asserts that the same thing may be born in anything:” below (p. 232 D).
Anaxagoras, however, seems to have indulged in the same dictum (<span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p205.1"></span>πᾶν ἐν παντὶ</span>),
but with a difference; as Nicetas explains in his commentary on Gregory
Naz., *Orations:* “That everything is contained in everything Empedocles
asserted, and Anaxagoras asserted also: but not with the same meaning.
Empedocles said it of the four elements, namely, that they are not only
divided and self-centred, but are also mingled with each other. This is
clear from the fact that every animal is engendered by all four. But
Anaxagoras, finding an old proverb that nothing can be produced out of
nothing, did away with creation, and introduced ‘differentiation’
instead, &c.” See also Greg. Naz., *Poems,* p. 170.

they roll, not on their axes, but only as turning round with the general
revolution. They are literally *fixed* in that heaven (cf. Virg.:
“tacito volvuntur sidera lapsu”): and the spiritual beings in it are as

well.” Obviously these two theories are those alluded to at the
beginning of this last speech of Macrina, where, speaking of the heathen
transmigration, she says, “While some of them extend this absurdity even
to trees and shrubs, so that they consider their wooden life as
corresponding and akin to humanity (*i.e.* <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p220.5"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p220.8"></span>ἕτερος</span>). In
either case the soul is supposed to return from the dead body to heaven,
and then by a fresh fall into sin there, to sink down again. The
absurdity and the godlessness is just as glaring, Macrina says, in the
last case (the Platonic soul-rotation) as in the first (Transmigration
pure and simple). But the one point in both in contact with the
Christian Resurrection is this, that the soul of the departed *does
assume another body*.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p235"></span> Origen, Gregory’s master in most of his
theology, did teach this very thing, the pre-existence of the soul: nor
did he attempt to deny that *some* degree of transmigration was a
necessary accompaniment of such teaching; only he would adjust the moral
meaning of it. Cf. *c. Celsum,* Lib. iii. 75. “And even if we should
treat (*i e.* medically) those who have caught the folly of the
transmigration of souls from doctors who push down a reasoning nature
into any of the unreasoning natures, or even into that which is
insensate, how can any say that we shall not work improvement in their
souls by teaching them that the bad do not have allotted to them by way
of punishment that insensate or unreasoning state, but that what is
inflicted by God upon the bad, be it pain or affliction, is only in the
way of a very efficacious cure for them? This is the teaching of the
wise Christian: he attempts to teach the simpler of his flock as fathers
do the merest infants.” Not the theory itself, but the exaggeration of
it, is here combated.

Gregory’s view, a “thought” of God, which becomes visible by the soul
being born. There will come a time when all these “thoughts,” which
complete, and do not destroy, each other, will have completed the <span

(Humanity) which the Deity contemplates. This immediate apparition of a
soul, as a “thought” of God, is very unlike the teaching of his master
Origen: and yet more sober, and more scriptural.

understood. Cf. Matt., Gr. Gr. §532.\] The LXX. is rendered by the
Psalterium Romanum “constitute diem in *confrequentationibus*.” So also
Eusebius, Theodoret, and Chrysostom interpret. But the Psalterium
Gallicanum reproduces the LXX. otherwise, *i.e.* in *condensis,* as
Apollinaris and Jerome (in *frondosis*) also understand it. “Adorn the
feast with green boughs, even to the horns of the altar”: Luther. “It is
true that during the time of the second temple the altar of burnt
offering was planted round about at the Feast of Tabernacles with large
branches of osiers, which leaned over the edge of that altar”: Delitzsch
(who however says that this is, *linguistically,* untenable). Gregory’s
rendering differs from this only in making <span class="Greek"><span

changed,” in distinction from the dead *generally,* who “shall be raised
incorruptible”). But the doctrine of a *general* resurrection, with or
without change, is quite in harmony with the end of this treatise. Cf.

Judgment comes *after* the Resurrection (cf. 250 A, 254 A, 258 D), and
*after* the purifying and chastising detailed above. The latter is
represented by Gregory as a necessary process of *nature:* but not till
the Judgment will the moral value of each life be revealed. There is no
contradiction, such as Möller tries to find, between this Dialogue and
Gregory’s *Oratio Catechetica.* There too he is speaking of chastisement
after the Resurrection and *before* the Judgment. “For not everything
that is granted in the resurrection a return to existence will return to
the same kind of life. There is a wide interval between those who have
been purified (*i.e.* by baptism) and those who still need
purification.”…“But as for those whose weaknesses have become
inveterate, and to whom no purgation of their defilement has been
applied, no mystic water, no invocation of the Divine power, no
amendment by repentance, it is absolutely necessary that they should be
submitted to something proper to their case,” *i.e.* to compensate for
Baptism, which they have never received (c. 35).

rivals that of Heraclitus: and that there is a deliberate intention of
improving on the expression of the latter, “you cannot step twice into
the same stream.” Above (p. 459), Gregory has used directly Heraclitus’
image, “so that Nature’s stream may not flow on for ever, pouring
forward in her successive births,” &c. See also *De Hom. Opif.* c. 13

not exaggeration to say that death is woven into our life. Practically
such an idea will be found by any one to be based on a reality: for
experiment would confirm this belief that the man of yesterday is not
the same as the man of today in material substance, but that something
of him must be alway becoming dead, or be growing, or being destroyed,
or ejected:…Wherefore, according to the expression of the mighty Paul,
‘we die daily’: we are not always the same people remaining in the same
homes of the body, but each moment we change from what we were by
reception and ejectment, altering continually into a fresh body.”

<span id="x.iii.ii-p266"></span> Which succeeds (and is bound up with)
the Resurrection. The argument is, “the *flesh* has behaved differently
in *different persons* here; how then can it be treated alike in all by
being allowed to rise again? Even before the judgment an injustice has
been done by all rising in the same way to a new life.”—In what follows,

class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p277.2"></span>ν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ</span>

id="x.iii.ii-p277.4"></span>ν τῷ μετὰ ταῦτα</span>, which cannot
possibly refer to what immediately precedes, *i.e.* the union with God,
by means of the Resurrection. If <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p277.5"></span>μετὰ ταῦτα</span> is retained, it must =
<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p277.6"></span>μετὰ τοῦτον τὸν
βίον</span>. Gregory here implies that the Resurrection is not a single
contemporaneous act, but differs in time, as individuals differ;
carrying out the Scriptural distinction of a first and second
Resurrection.

<span id="fn_1921"></span>[466:1923](2050215.htm#fr_1921.md) <span
id="x.iii.ii-p277.7"></span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p278"></span> Dr. H. Schmidt has an admirable note
here, pointing out the great and important difference between S. Paul’s
use of this analogy of the grain of wheat, and that of our Saviour in S.
[John xii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#023.md)<span
id="x.iii.ii-p278.1"></span>, whence S. Paul took it. In the words, “The
hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily I
say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit” (A.V.), the
fact and the similitude exactly correspond. To the corn with its
life-engendering shoot, answers the man with his vivifying soul. The
shoot, when the necessary conditions are fulfilled, breaks through the
corn, and mounts up into an ear, exquisitely developed: so the soul,
when the due time is come, bursts from the body into a nobler form.
Again, through the death of the integument a number of new corns are
produced: so through the death of the body that encases a perfect soul
(*i.e.* that of Jesus), an abundance of blessings is produced for
mankind. Everything here exactly corresponds; the principle of life, on
the one hand in the corn, on the other hand in the human body, breaks,
by dying, into a more beautiful existence. But this comparison in S.
Paul becomes a *similitude* rather than an *analogy.* With him the
lifeless body is set over against the life-containing corn; he does not
compare the lifeless body with the lifeless corn: because out of the
latter no stalk and ear would ever grow. The comparison, therefore, is
not exact: it is not pretended that the rising to life of the dead human
body is not a process transcendently above the natural process of the
rising of the ear of wheat. But the similitude serves to illustrate the
*form* and the *quality* of the risen body, which has been in question
since v. 35 ([1 Cor. 15.35](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035.md)<span
id="x.iii.ii-p278.2"></span>.), “with what body do they come?” and the
salient point is that the risen body will be as little like the buried
body, *as* the ear of wheat is like its corn. The possibility of the
Resurrection has been *already* proved by S. Paul in this chapter by
Christ’s own Resurrection, which he states from the very commencement as
a fact: it is not proved by this similitude.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p284"></span> This “*naked* grain” is suggested by
the words of S. Paul, not so much [1 Cor.
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037.md), [2 Cor.
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md)<span
id="x.iii.ii-p284.1"></span>[1 Cor. xv.
37](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037.md)<span id="x.iii.ii-p284.2"></span>,
as [2 Cor. v. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md)<span
id="x.iii.ii-p284.3"></span>: “For we that are in this tabernacle do
groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed
upon.” Tertullian’s words (*de resurr. carnis* c. 52) deserve to be
quoted, “Seritur granum sine folliculi veste, sine fundamento spicæ,
sine munimento aristæ, sine superbiâ culmi. Exsurgit copiâ feneratum,
compagine ædificatum, ordine structum, cultu munitum, et usquequaque
vestitum.” In allusion to this passage (<span
id="x.iii.ii-p284.4"></span>[2 Cor. v.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004)<span id="x.iii.ii-p284.5"></span>.md),
Origen says, “Our theory of the Resurrection teaches that the relations
of a seed attach to that which the Scriptures call the ‘tabernacle of
the soul,’ in which the righteous ‘do groan being burdened,’ not wishing
to put it off, but ‘to be clothed upon’ (with something else). We do
not, as Celsus thinks, mean by the resurrection anything like the
transmigration of souls. The soul, in its essence unbodied and
invisible, when it comes into material space, requires a body fitted to
the conditions of that particular space: which body it wears, having
either put off a former body, or else having put it on over its former
body…For instance, when it comes to the actual birth into this world it
lays aside the environment (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p284.6"></span>χωρίον</span>) which was needed as long as
it is in the womb of her that is with child: and it clothes itself with
that which is necessary for one destined to pass through life. Then
there is a ‘tabernacle,’ and ‘an earthly house,’ as well: and the
Scriptures tell us that this ‘earthly house’ of the tabernacle is to be
dissolved, but that the tabernacle itself is to surround itself with
another house not made with hands. The men of God declare that the
corruptible must put on incorruption (which is a different thing from
the incorruptible), and the mortal must put on immortality (which is
different from the immortal: just as the relative quality of wisdom is
different from that which is absolutely wise). Observe, then, where this
system leads us. It says that the souls put on incorruption and
immortality like garments which keep their wearer from corruption, and
their inmate (<span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p284.7"></span>τὸν
περικείμενον αὐτὰ</span>) from death” (*c. Cels*. vii. 32). We see at
once this is another explanation of the Resurrection, by the <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii.ii-p284.8"></span>σπερματικὸς λόγος</span>
of the soul, and not Gregory’s; with him the soul recollects its
scattered atoms, and he thus saves the true scriptural view.

id="x.iii.ii-p284.9"></span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p285"></span> This connection of “evil” and
“multitude” is essentially Platonic. Cf. also Plotinus, vi. 6. 1:
“Multitude, then, is a revolt from unity, and infinity a more complete
revolt by being infinite multitude: and so infinity is bad, and we are
bad, when we are a multitude” (cf. “Legion” in the parable).

<span id="x.iii.ii-p286"></span> *as happens to the grain,* i.e. to
become bare, as compared with the beautiful envelopments of the entire
ear.

<span id="x.iii.ii-p287"></span> *“hornstruck” seeds,* i.e. those which
have been struck by, or have struck, the horns of the oxen, in the
process of sowing: according to the rustic superstition, which Gregory
Nazianz. in some very excellent hexameters alludes to (*Opp.* t. II. pp.
66–163): “There is,” he says, “a dry unsoakable seed, which never sinks
into the ground, or fattens with the rain; it is harder than horn; its
horn has struck the horn of the ox, what time the ploughman’s hand is
scattering the grain over his land.” Ruhnken (ad *Timæum,* p. 155) has
collected the ancient authorities on this point. The word is used by
Plato of a “hard,” “intractable” person. The “bare grain” of the wicked
is here compared to these hard seeds, which even though they may sink
into the earth and rise again, yet have a poor and stunted blade, which
may never grow.
