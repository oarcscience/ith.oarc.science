<span id="xiii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.vii-p1.1"></span>Letter VI</span>.—*To Stagirius*.

<span id="xiii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.vii-p2.1"></span>They</span> say that conjurors <span
id="fr_2178"></span>[2180](#fn_2178) in theatres contrive some such
marvel as this which I am going to describe. Having taken some
historical narrative, or some old story as the ground-plot of their
sleight of hand, they relate the story to the spectators in action. And
it is in this way that they make their representations of the
narrative <span id="fr_2179"></span>[2181](#fn_2179) . They put on their
dresses and masks, and rig up something to resemble a town on the stage
with hangings, and then so associate the bare scene with their life-like
imitation of action that they are a marvel to the spectators—both the
actors themselves of the incidents of the play, and the hangings, or
rather their imaginary city. What do I mean, do you think, by this
allegory? Since we must needs show to those who are coming together that
which is not a city as though it were one, do you let yourself be
persuaded to become for the nonce the founder of our city <span
id="fr_2180"></span>[2182](#fn_2180) , by just putting in an appearance
there; I will make the desert-place seem to be a city; now it is no
great distance for you, and the favour which you will confer is very
great; for we wish to show ourselves more splendid to our companions
here, which we shall do if, in place of any other ornament, we are
adorned with the splendour of your party.

something more than ordinary mime playing, or than the optical illusion
of tableaux-vivants, but less than what we should call conjuring seems
to be meant (H. C. O.).
