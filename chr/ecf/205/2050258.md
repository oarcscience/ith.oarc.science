<span id="xi.ii.xl-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xl-p2.1"></span>There</span> is now, I think, wanting in these
remarks no answer to inquiries concerning the Gospel mystery, except
that on Faith <span id="fr_2041"></span>[2043](#fn_2041.md) ; which we give
briefly in the present treatise. For those who require a more elaborate
account we have already published it in other works of ours, in which we
have explained the subject with all the earnestness and accuracy in our
power. In those treatises we have both fought <span
id="fr_2042"></span>[2044](#fn_2042.md) controversially with our opponents,
and also have taken private consultation with ourselves as to the
questions which have been brought against us. But in the present
discussion we have thought it as well only to say just so much on the
subject of faith as is involved in the language of the Gospel, namely,
that one who is begotten by the spiritual regeneration may know who it
is that begets him, and what sort of creature he becomes. For it is only
this form of generation which has in it the power to become what it
chooses to be.

whereby they steadfastly believe the promises of God made to them in
that Sacrament (of Baptism).”

<span id="xi.ii.xl-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xl-p4.1"></span>συνεπλάκημεν</span>, *i.e.* against Eunomius,
in defence of the equality of the Trinity in the Baptismal symbol. Often
as Gregory in that treatise opposes Eunomius for placing the essence of
Christianity in mere <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xl-p4.2"></span>γνῶσι</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xl-p4.3"></span>ς</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xl-p4.4"></span>δογμάτων ἀκρίβεια</span>, as against God’s
incomprehensibility, and knowledge only by the heart, he had yet spent
his whole life in showing the supreme importance of accuracy in the
formulas upon which the Faith rested. This helps to give a date for the
*Great Catechism.*
