id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—<span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p1.2"></span>Mss.</span> <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p1.3"></span>And Editions</span>.</span>

<span id="vii.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p2.1"></span>For</span> the 13 Books *Against Eunomius,* the
text of F. Oehler (S. Greg. Nyss. Opera. Tom. I. Halis, 1865) has in the
following translations been almost entirely followed.

<span id="vii.v-p3"></span>The 1st Book was not in the 1st Paris Edition
in two volumes (1615); but it was published three years afterwards from
the ‘Bavarian Codex,’ i.e. that of Munich, by J. Gretser in an Appendix,
along with the *Summaries* (these headings of the sections of the entire
work are by some admirer of Gregory’s) and the two introductory Letters.
Both the Summaries and the letters, and also nearly three-quarters of
the 1st Book were obtained from J. Livineius’ transcript of the Vatican
<span class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p3.1"></span>ms.</span> made at Rome,
1579. This Appendix was added to the 2nd Paris Edition, in three volumes
(1638).

<span id="vii.v-p4"></span>In correcting these Paris Editions (for <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p4.1"></span>mss.</span> of which see
below), Oehler had access, in addition to the identical Munich <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p4.2"></span>ms.</span> (paper, 16th
century) which Gretser had used, to the following <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p4.3"></span>mss.</span>:—

<span id="vii.v-p5"></span>1. Venice (Library of S. Mark; cotton, 13
Cent., No. 69). This he says ‘wonderfully agrees’ with the Munich (both,
for instance, supply the lacunæ of the Paris Edition of Book I: he
concludes, therefore, that these are not due to Gretser’s negligence,
who gives the Latin for these passages, but to that of the printers).

<span id="vii.v-p6"></span>2. Turin (Royal Library; cotton, 14 Cent.,
No. 71).

<span id="vii.v-p7"></span>3. Milan (Library of S. Ambrose; cotton, 13
Cent., No. 225, Plut. 1; its inscription says that it was brought from
Thessaly).

<span id="vii.v-p8"></span>4. Florence (Library Medic. Laurent.; the
oldest of all; parchment, 11 Cent., No. 17, Plut. vi. It contains the
*Summaries*).

<span id="vii.v-p9"></span>These, and the Munich <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p9.1"></span>ms.</span>, which he chiefly used, are “all of
the same family:” and from them he has been able to supply more than 50
lacunæ in the Books against Eunomius. This family is the first of the
two separated by G. H. Forbes (see below). The Munich <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p9.2"></span>ms.</span> (No. 47, on paper,
16 Cent.), already used by Sifanus for his Latin version (1562), and by
Gretser for his Appendix, has the corrections of the former in its
margin. These passed into the two Paris Editions; which, however, took
no notice of his critical notes. When lent to Sifanus this <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p9.3"></span>ms.</span> was in the Library
of J. J. Fugger. Albert V. Duke of Bavaria purchased the treasures of
Greek literature in this library, to found that in Munich.

<span id="vii.v-p10"></span>For the treatise *On the Soul and the
Resurrection,* the *Great Catechetical Oration,* and the *Funeral
Oration on Meletius,* John George Krabinger’s text has been adopted. He
had <span class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p10.1"></span>mss.</span> ‘old and
of a better stamp’ (Oehler) than were accessible to the Paris editors.
Krabinger’s own account of them is this:—

<span id="vii.v-p11"></span>*On the Soul.* 5 <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p11.1"></span>mss.</span> of 16th, 14th, and 11th Cent. All at
Munich. In one of them there are scholia, some imported into the text by
J. Naupliensis Murmureus the copyist; and Sifanus’ corrections.

<span id="vii.v-p12"></span>The ‘Hasselman,’ 14th Cent. J. Christopher
Wolf, who annotated this treatise (*Aneedota Græca,* Hamburgh, 1722),
says of this <span class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p12.1"></span>ms.</span>
“very carefully written.” It was lent by Zach. Hasselman, Minister of
Oldenburgh.

<span id="vii.v-p13"></span>The ‘Uffenbach,’ 14th Cent., with var. lect.
in margin. Lent to Wolf by the Polish ambassador at Frankfort on Main,
at the request of Zach. Uffenbach.

<span id="vii.v-p14"></span>*Catechetical Oration.* 4 <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p14.1"></span>mss.</span> of 16th Cent., 1
*of 13th Cent., ‘much mutilated.’* All at Munich.

<span id="vii.v-p15"></span>*On Meletius.* 2 <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p15.1"></span>mss.</span> of 16th Cent., 1 of 10th Cent. All
at Munich.

<span id="vii.v-p16"></span>His edition of the former appeared, at
Leipzic, 1837; of the two latter, at Munich, 1838; all with valuable
notes.

<span id="vii.v-p17"></span><span id="page_XXXI">p. XXXI</span> <span
id="vii.v-Page_XXXI"></span>For the treatise *Against Macedonius,* the
only text available is that of Cardinal Angelo Mai (Script. Vet. Nova
Collectio, Rome, 1833). It is taken from the Vatican <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p17.1"></span>ms.</span> ‘on silk.’ The end
of this treatise is not found in Mai. Perhaps it is in the <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p17.2"></span>ms.</span> of Florence.

<span id="vii.v-p18"></span>For fourteen of the *Letters,* Zacagni
(Præfect of the Vatican Library, 1698–1713) is the only editor. His text
from the Vatican <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p18.1"></span>ms.</span>, No. 424, is printed in his
Collectan. Monument. ret. (pp. 354–400), Rome, 1698.

<span id="vii.v-p19"></span>He had not the use of the Medicean <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p19.1"></span>ms.</span> which Caraccioli
(see below) testifies to be much superior to the Vatican; there are
lacunæ in the latter, however, which Zacagni occasionally fills by a
happy guess with the very words supplied by the Medicean.

<span id="vii.v-p20"></span>For the *Letter to Adelphius,* and that (on
Church Architecture) *to Amphilochius,* J. B. Caraccioli (Professor of
Philosophy at Pisa) furnishes a text (Florence, 1731) from the Medicean
<span class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p20.1"></span>ms.</span> The Letters
in this collection are seven in all. Of the last of these (including
that to Amphilochius) Bandinus says *non sincerâ fide ex Codice
descriptas,* and that a fresh collation is necessary.

<span id="vii.v-p21"></span>For the treatise *On the Making of Man,* the
text employed has been that of G. H. Forbes, (his first Fasciculus was
published in 1855; his second in 1861; both at Burntisland, at his
private press), with an occasional preference for the readings of one or
other of the <span class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p21.1"></span>mss.</span>
examined by him or by others on his behalf. Of these he specifies
twenty: but he had examined a much larger number. The <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p21.2"></span>mss.</span> which contain this
work, he considers, are of two families.

<span id="vii.v-p22"></span>Of the first family the most important are
three <span class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p22.1"></span>mss.</span> at
Vienna, a tenth-century <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p22.2"></span>ms.</span> on vellum at S. Mark’s, Venice, which
he himself collated, and a Vatican <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p22.3"></span>ms.</span> of the tenth century. This family
also includes three of the four Munich <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p22.4"></span>mss.</span> collated for Forbes by Krabinger.

<span id="vii.v-p23"></span>The other family displays more variations
from the current text. One Vienna <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p23.1"></span>ms.</span> “pervetustus” “initio mutilus,” was
completely collated. Also belonging to this family are the oldest of the
four Munich <span class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p23.2"></span>mss.</span>,
the tenth-century Codex Regius (Paris), and a fourteenth-century <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p23.3"></span>ms.</span> at Christ Church,
Oxford, clearly related to the last.

<span id="vii.v-p24"></span>The Codex Baroccianus (Bodleian, perhaps
eleventh century) appears to occupy an independent position.

<span id="vii.v-p25"></span>For the *other Treatises and Letters* the
text of the Paris Edition of 1638 (‘plenior et emendatior’ than that of
1615, according to Oehler, probably following its own title, but “much
inferior to that of 1615” Canon Venables, *Dict. Christ. Biog.,* says,
and this is the judgment of J. Fessler) and of Migne have been necessary
as the latest *complete* editions of the works of Gregory Nyssene. (All
the materials that had been collected for the edition of the
Benedictines of St. Maur perished in the French Revolution.)

<span id="vii.v-p26"></span>Of the two Paris Editions it must be
confessed that they are based ‘for the most part on inferior <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.v-p26.1"></span>mss.</span>’ (Oehler.) The
frequent lacunæ attest this. Fronto Ducæus aided Claude, the brother of
F. Morel, in settling the text, and the <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p26.2"></span>mss.</span> mentioned in the notes of the former
are as follows:

<span id="vii.v-p27"></span>1. Pithoeus’ “not of a very ancient hand,”
“as like F. Morel’s (No. 2.) as milk to milk” (so speaks John the
Franciscan, who emended ‘from one corrupt mutilated manuscript,’ i.e.
the above, the Latin translation of the Books against Eunomius made by
his father N. Gulonius.)

<span id="vii.v-p28"></span>2. F. Morel’s. (“Dean of Professors” and
Royal Printer.)

<span id="vii.v-p29"></span>3. The Royal (in the Library of Henry II.,
Paris), on vellum, tenth century.

<span id="vii.v-p30"></span>4. Canter’s (“ingens codex” sent from
Antwerp by A. Schott; it had been written out for T. Canter, Senator of
Utrecht).

<span id="vii.v-p31"></span>5. Olivar’s. “Multo emendatius” than (2.)

<span id="vii.v-p32"></span>6. J. Vulcobius’, Abbot of Belpré.

<span id="vii.v-p33"></span>7. The Vatican. For the treatise *On
Virginity*. (The Paris Editors used Livineius’ Edition, based on (7) and
(8).

<span id="vii.v-p34"></span>8. Bricman’s (Cologne). For the treatise *On
Virginity*. (The Paris Editors used Livineius’ Edition, based on (7) and
(8).

<span id="vii.v-p35"></span>9. Œgidius David’s, I.C. Paris. For the
treatise *On Virginity*. (The Paris Editors used Livineius’ Edition,
based on (7) and (8).

<span id="vii.v-p36"></span><span id="page_XXXII">p. XXXII</span> <span
id="vii.v-Page_XXXII"></span>10. The Bavarian (Munich) for Books
II.–XIII. Against Eunomius and other treatises; only after the first
edition of 1615.

<span id="vii.v-p37"></span>Other important <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p37.1"></span>mss.</span> existing for treatises here
translated are

<span id="vii.v-p38"></span>*On Pilgrimages:* <span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p38.1"></span>ms.</span> Cæsareus (Vienna): “valde vetustus”
(Nessel, on the Imperial Library), vellum, No. 160, burnt at beginning.

<span id="vii.v-p39"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p39.1"></span>mss.</span> Florence (xx. 17: xvi. 8).

<span id="vii.v-p40"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p40.1"></span>ms.</span> Leyden (not older than fifteenth
century).

<span id="vii.v-p41"></span>On the Making of Man:

<span id="vii.v-p42"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p42.1"></span>ms.</span> Augsburgh, with twelve Homilies of
Basil, the two last being wrongly attributed to Gregory (Reizer).

<span id="vii.v-p43"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p43.1"></span>ms.</span> Ambrosian (Milan). See Montfaucon,
Bibl. Bibliothec. p. 498.

<span id="vii.v-p44"></span>On Infants’ Early Deaths:

<span id="vii.v-p45"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p45.1"></span>ms.</span> Turin (Royal Library).

<span id="vii.v-p46"></span>On the Soul and Resurrection:

<span id="vii.v-p47"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p47.1"></span>mss.</span> Augsburgh, Florence, Turin, Venice.

<span id="vii.v-p48"></span>Great Catechetical:

<span id="vii.v-p49"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p49.1"></span>mss.</span> Augsburgh, Florence, Turin,
Cæsareus.

<span id="vii.v-p50"></span>Many other <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.v-p50.1"></span>mss.</span>, for these and other treatises, are
given by S. Heyns (*Disputatio de Greg. Nyss.* Leyden, 1835). But
considering the mutilated condition of most of the oldest, and the still
small number of treatises edited from an extended collation of these,
the complaint is still true that ‘the text of hardly any other ancient
writer is in a more imperfect state than that of Gregory of Nyssa.’

<span id="vii.v-p51"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.v-p51.1"></span>Versions of Several Treatises</span>.

<span id="vii.v-p52"></span>Latin.

Fronto Ducæus, the Jesuit, and Combeficius. There is a copy of it at
