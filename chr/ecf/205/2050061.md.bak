<span id="viii.i.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iv.ii-p1"></span> §2. *Gregory then makes an
explanation at length touching the eternal Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit.*

<span id="viii.i.iv.ii-p2"></span>Since then this doctrine is put forth
by the Truth itself, it follows that anything which the inventors of
pestilent heresies devise besides to subvert this Divine utterance,—as,
for example, calling the Father “Maker” and “Creator” of the Son instead
of “Father,” and the Son a “result,” a “creature,” a “product,” instead
of “Son,” and the Holy Spirit the “creature of a creature,” and the
“product of a product,” instead of His proper title the “Spirit,” and
whatever those who fight against God are pleased to say of Him,—all such
fancies we term a denial and violation of the Godhead revealed to us in
this doctrine. For once for all we have learned from the Lord, through
Whom comes the transformation of our nature from mortality to
immortality,—from Him, I say, we have learned to what we ought to look
<span id="page_CII">p. CII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.ii-Page_CII"></span>with the eyes of our
understanding,—that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We say
that it is a terrible and soul-destroying thing to misinterpret these
Divine utterances and to devise in their stead assertions to subvert
them,—assertions pretending to correct God the Word, Who appointed that
we should maintain these statements as part of our faith. For each of
these titles understood in its natural sense becomes for Christians a
rule of truth and a law of piety. For while there are many other names
by which Deity is indicated in the Historical Books, in the Prophets and
in the Law, our Master Christ passes by all these and commits to us
these titles as better able to bring us to the faith about the
Self-Existent, declaring that it suffices us to cling to the title,
“Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,” in order to attain to the apprehension of
Him Who is absolutely Existent, Who is one and yet not one. In regard to
essence He is one, wherefore the Lord ordained that we should look to
one Name: but in regard to the attributes indicative of the Persons, our
belief in Him is distinguished into belief in the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost <span id="fr_247"></span>[249](#fn_247.md) ; He is divided
without separation, and united without confusion. For when we hear the
title “Father” we apprehend the meaning to be this, that the name is not
understood with reference to itself alone, but also by its special
signification indicates the relation to the Son. For the term “Father”
would have no meaning apart by itself, if “Son” were not connoted by the
utterance of the word “Father.” When, then, we learnt the name “Father”
we were taught at the same time, by the selfsame title, faith also in
the Son. Now since Deity by its very nature is permanently and immutably
the same in all that pertains to its essence, nor did it at any time
fail to be anything that it now is, nor will it at any future time be
anything that it now is not, and since He Who is the very Father was
named Father by the Word, and since in the Father the Son is
implied,—since these things are so, we of necessity believe that He Who
admits no change or alteration in His nature was always entirely what He
is now, or, if there is anything which He was not, *that* He assuredly
is not now. Since then He is named Father by the very Word, He assuredly
always was Father, and is and will be even as He was. For surely it is
not lawful in speaking of the Divine and unimpaired Essence to deny that
what is excellent always belonged to It. For if He was not always what
He now is, He certainly changed either from the better to the worse or
from the worse to the better, and of these assertions the impiety is
equal either way, whichever statement is made concerning the Divine
nature. But in fact the Deity is incapable of change and alteration. So,
then, everything that is excellent and good is always contemplated in
the fountain of excellency. But “the Only-begotten God, Who is in the
bosom of the Father <span id="fr_248"></span>[250](#fn_248.md) ” is
excellent, and beyond all excellency:—mark you, He says, “Who *is* in
the bosom of the Father,” not “Who came to be” there.

<span id="viii.i.iv.ii-p5"></span>Well then, it has been demonstrated by
these proofs that the Son is from all eternity to be contemplated in the
Father, in Whom He is, being Life and Light and Truth, and every noble
name and conception—to say that the Father ever existed by Himself apart
from these attributes is a piece of the utmost impiety and infatuation.
For if the Son, as the Scripture saith, is the Power of God, and Wisdom,
and Truth, and Light, and Sanctification, and Peace, and Life, and the
like, then before the Son existed, according to the view of the
heretics, these things also had no existence at all. And if these things
had no existence they must certainly conceive the bosom of the Father to
have been devoid of such excellences. To the end, then, that the Father
might not be conceived as destitute of the excellences which are His
own, and that the doctrine might not run wild into this extravagance,
the right faith concerning the Son is necessarily included in our Lord’s
utterance with the contemplation of the eternity of the Father. And for
this reason He passes over all those names which are employed to
indicate the surpassing excellence of the Divine nature <span
id="fr_249"></span>[251](#fn_249.md) , and delivers to us as part of our
profession of faith the title of “Father” as better suited to indicate
the truth, being a title which, as has been said, by its relative sense
connotes with itself the Son, while the Son, Who is in the Father,
always is what He essentially is, as has been said already, because the
Deity by Its very nature does not admit of augmentation. For It does not
perceive any other good outside of Itself, by participation in which It
could acquire any accession, but is always immutable, neither casting
away what It has, nor acquiring what It has not: for none of Its
properties are such as to be cast away. And if there is anything
whatsoever blessed, unsullied, true and good, associated with Him and in
Him, we see of necessity that the good and holy Spirit must belong to
Him <span id="fr_250"></span>[252](#fn_250.md) , not <span
id="page_CIII">p. CIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.ii-Page_CIII"></span>by way of accretion. That Spirit is
indisputably a princely Spirit <span id="fr_251"></span>[253](#fn_251.md) ,
a quickening Spirit, the controlling and sanctifying force of all
creation, the Spirit that “worketh all in all” as He wills <span
id="fr_252"></span>[254](#fn_252.md) . Thus we conceive no gap between the
anointed Christ and His anointing, between the King and His sovereignty,
between Wisdom and the Spirit of Wisdom, between Truth and the Spirit of
Truth, between Power and the Spirit of Power, but as there is
contemplated from all eternity in the Father the Son, Who is Wisdom and
Truth, and Counsel, and Might, and Knowledge, and Understanding, so
there is also contemplated in Him the Holy Spirit, Who is the Spirit of
Wisdom, and of Truth, and of Counsel, and of Understanding, and all else
that the Son is and is called. For which reason we say that to the holy
disciples the mystery of godliness was committed in a form expressing at
once union and distinction,—that we should believe on the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. For the differentiation
of the subsistences <span id="fr_253"></span>[255](#fn_253.md) makes the
distinction of Persons <span id="fr_254"></span>[256](#fn_254.md) clear and
free from confusion, while the one Name standing in the forefront of the
declaration of the Faith clearly expounds to us the unity of essence of
the Persons <span id="fr_255"></span>[257](#fn_255.md) Whom the Faith
declares,—I mean, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
For by these appellations we are taught not a difference of nature, but
only the special attributes that mark the subsistences <span
id="fr_256"></span>[258](#fn_256.md) , so that we know that neither is the
Father the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Spirit either the
Father or the Son, and recognize each by the distinctive mark of His
Personal Subsistence <span id="fr_257"></span>[259](#fn_257.md) , in
illimitable perfection, at once contemplated by Himself and not divided
from that with Which He is connected.

[Next: Gregory proceeds to discuss the relative force of the unnameable
name of the Holy Trinity and the mutual relation of the Persons, and
moreover the unknowable character of the essence, and the condescension
on His part towards us, His generation of the Virgin, and His second
coming, the resurrection from the dead and future retribution.](2050062.md)
