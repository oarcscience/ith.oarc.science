<span id="viii.i.xii.i-Page_CCXX"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.i.xii.i-p1.1"></span>Book X.</span>

<span id="viii.i.xii.i-p2"></span>§1. *The tenth book discusses the
unattainable and incomprehensible character of the enquiry into
entities. And herein he strikingly sets forth the points concerning the
nature and formation of the ant, and the passage in the Gospel, “I am
the door” and “the way,” and also discusses the attribution and
interpretation of the Divine names, and the episode of the children of
Benjamin.*

<span id="viii.i.xii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="viii.i.xii.i-p3.1"></span>Let</span> us, however, keep to our
subject. A little further on he contends against those who acknowledge
that human nature is too weak to conceive what cannot be grasped, and
with lofty boasts enlarges on this topic on this wise, making light of
our belief on the matter in these words:—“For it by no means follows
that, if some one’s mind, blinded by malignity, and for that reason
unable to see anything in front or above its head, is but moderately
competent for the apprehension of truth, we ought on that ground to
think that the discovery of reality is unattainable by the rest of
mankind.” But I should say to him that he who declares that the
discovery of reality is attainable, has of course advanced his own
intellect by some method and logical process through the knowledge of
existent things, and after having been trained in matters that are
comparatively small and easily grasped by way of apprehension, has, when
thus prepared, flung his apprehensive fancy upon those objects which
transcend all conception. Let, then, the man who boasts that he has
attained the knowledge of real existence, interpret to us the real
nature of the most trivial object that is before our eyes, that by what
is knowable he may warrant our belief touching what is secret: let him
explain by reason what is the nature of the ant, whether its life is
held together by breath and respiration, whether it is regulated by
vital organs like other animals, whether its body has a framework of
bones, whether the hollows of the bones are filled with marrow, whether
its joints are united by the tension of sinews and ligaments, whether
the position of the sinews is maintained by enclosures of muscles and
glands, whether the marrow extends along the vertebræ from the sinciput
to the tail, whether it imparts to the limbs that are moved the power of
motion by means of the enclosure of sinewy membrane; whether the
creature has a liver, and in connection with the liver a gall-bladder;
whether it has kidneys and heart, arteries and veins, membranes and
diaphragm; whether it is externally smooth or covered with hair; whether
it is distinguished by the division into male and female; in what part
of its body is located the power of sight and hearing; whether it enjoys
the sense of smell; whether its feet are undivided or articulated; how
long it lives; what is the method in which they derive generation one
from another, and what is the period of gestation; how it is that all
ants do not crawl, nor are all winged, but some belong to the creatures
that move along the ground, while others are borne aloft in the air. Let
him, then, who boasts that he has grasped the knowledge of real
existence, disclose to us awhile the nature of the ant, and then, and
not till then, let him discourse on the nature of the power that
surpasses all understanding. But if he has not yet ascertained by his
knowledge the nature of the tiny ant, how comes he to vaunt that by the
apprehension of reason he has grasped Him Who in Himself controls all
creation, and to say that those who own in themselves the weakness of
human nature, have the perceptions of their souls darkened, and can
neither reach anything in front of them, nor anything above their head?

<span id="viii.i.xii.i-p4"></span>But now let us see what understanding
he who has the knowledge of existent things possesses beyond the rest of
the world. Let us listen to his arrogant utterance:—“Surely it would
have been idle for the Lord to call Himself ‘the door,’ if there were
none to pass through to the understanding and contemplation of the
Father, and it would have been idle for Him to call Himself ‘the way,’
if He gave no facility to those who wish to come to the Father. And how
could He be a light, without lightening men, without illuminating the
eye of their soul to understand both Himself and the transcendent
Light?” Well, if he were here enumerating some arguments from his own
head, that evade the understanding of the hearers by their subtlety,
there would perhaps be a possibility of <span id="page_CCXXI">p.
CCXXI</span> <span id="viii.i.xii.i-Page_CCXXI"></span>being deceived by
the ingenuity of the argument, as his underlying thought frequently
escapes the reader’s notice. But since he alleges the Divine words, of
course no one blames those who believe that their inspired teaching is
the common property of all. “Since then,” he says, “the Lord was named
‘a door,’ it follows from hence that the essence of God may be
comprehended by man.” But the Gospel does not admit of this meaning. Let
us hear the Divine utterance itself. “I am the door,” Christ says; “by
Me if any man enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and
find pasture <span id="fr_924"></span>[926](#fn_924.md) .” Which then of
these is the knowledge of the essence? For as several things are here
said, and each of them has its own special meaning, it is impossible to
refer them all to the idea of the essence, lest the Deity should be
thought to be compounded of different elements; and yet it is not easy
to find which of the phrases just quoted can most properly be applied to
that subject. The Lord is “the door,” “By Me,” He says, “if any man
enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and shall find
pasture.” Are we to say <span id="fr_925"></span>[927](#fn_925.md)
“entrance” of which he speaks in place of the essence of God, or
“salvation” of those that enter in, or “going out,” or “pasture,” or
“finding”?—for each of these is peculiar in its significance, and does
not agree in meaning with the rest. For to get within appears obviously
contrary to “going out,” and so with the other phrases. For “pasture,”
in its proper meaning, is one thing, and “finding” another thing
distinct from it. Which, then, of these is the essence of the Father
supposed to be? For assuredly one cannot, by uttering all these phrases
that disagree one with another in signification, intend to indicate by
incompatible terms that Essence which is simple and uncompounded. And
how can the word hold good, “No man hath seen God at any time <span
id="fr_926"></span>[928](#fn_926.md) ” and, “Whom no man hath seen nor can
see <span id="fr_927"></span>[929](#fn_927.md) ” and, “There shall no man
see the face of the Lord and live <span
id="fr_928"></span>[930](#fn_928.md) ” if to be inside the door, or
outside, or the finding pasture, denote the essence of the Father? For
truly He is at the same time a “door of encompassing <span
id="fr_929"></span>[931](#fn_929.md) ” and a “house of defence <span
id="fr_930"></span>[932](#fn_930.md) ” as David calls Him, and through
Himself He receives them that enter, and in Himself He saves those who
have come within, and again by Himself He leads them forth to the
pasture of virtues, and becomes all things to them that are in the way
of salvation, that so He may make Himself that which the needs of each
demand,—both way, and guide, and “door of encompassing,” and “house of
defence,” and “water of comfort <span id="fr_931"></span>[933](#fn_931.md)
” and “green pasture <span id="fr_932"></span>[934](#fn_932.md) ” which in
the Gospel He calls “pasture”: but our new divine says that the Lord has
been called “the door” because of the knowledge of the essence of the
Father. Why then does he not force into the same significance the
titles, “Rock,” and “Stone,” and “Fountain,” and “Tree,” and the rest,
that so he might obtain evidence for his own theory by the multitude of
strange testimonies, as he is well able to apply to each of these the
same account which he has given of the Way, the Door, and the Light?
But, as I am so taught by the inspired Scripture, I boldly affirm that
He Who is above every name has for us many names, receiving them in
accordance with the variety of His gracious dealings with us <span
id="fr_933"></span>[935](#fn_933.md) , being called the Light when He
disperses the gloom of ignorance, and the Life when He grants the boon
of immortality, and the Way when He guides us from error to the truth;
so also He is termed a “tower of strength <span
id="fr_934"></span>[936](#fn_934.md) ,” and a “city of encompassing <span
id="fr_935"></span>[937](#fn_935.md) ,” and a fountain, and a rock, and a
vine, and a physician, and resurrection, and all the like, with
reference to us, imparting Himself under various aspects by virtue of
His benefits to us-ward. But those who are keen-sighted beyond human
power, who see the incomprehensible, but overlook what may be
comprehended, when they use such titles to expound the essences, are
positive that they not only see, but measure Him Whom no man hath seen
nor can see, but do not with the eye of their soul discern the Faith,
which is the only thing within the compass of our observation, valuing
before this the knowledge which they obtain from ratiocination. Just so
I have heard the sacred record laying blame upon the sons of Benjamin
who did not regard the law, but could shoot within a hair’s
breadth <span id="fr_936"></span>[938](#fn_936.md) , wherein, methinks, the
word exhibited their eager pursuit of an idle object, that they were
far-darting and dexterous aimers at things that were useless and
unsubstantial, but ignorant and regardless of what was manifestly for
their benefit. For after what I have quoted, the history goes on to
relate what befel them, how, when they had run madly after the iniquity
of Sodom, and the people of Israel had taken up arms against them in
full force, they were utterly destroyed. And it seems to me to be a
kindly thought to warn young archers not to wish to shoot within a
hair’s-breadth, while they have no eyes for the door of the faith, but
rather to drop their idle labour about the incomprehensible, and not to
lose the gain that is ready to their hand, which is found by faith
alone.
