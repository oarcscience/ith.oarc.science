<span id="ix.ii.ii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.x-p2.1"></span>Custom</span> is indeed in everything hard
to resist. It possesses an enormous power of attracting and seducing the
soul. In the cases where a man has got into a fixed state of sentiment,
a certain imagination of the good is created in him by this habit; and
nothing is so naturally vile but it may come to be thought both
desirable and laudable, once it has got into the fashion <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[1390](#fn_1388.md) . Take mankind now living on the
earth. There are many nations, and their ambitions are not all the same.
The standard of beauty and of honour is different in each, the custom of
each regulating their enthusiasm and their aims. This unlikeness is seen
not only amongst nations where the pursuits of the one are in no <span
id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span id="ix.ii.ii.x-Page_354"></span>repute
with the other, but even in the same nation, and the same city, and the
same family; we may see in those aggregates also much difference
existing owing to customary feeling. Thus brothers born from the same
throe are separated widely from each other in the aims of life. Nor is
this to be wondered at, considering that each single man does not
generally keep to the same opinion about the same thing, but alters it
as fashion influences him. Not to go far from our present subject, we
have known those who have shown themselves to be in love with chastity
all through the early years of puberty; but in taking the pleasures
which men think legitimate and allowable they make them the
starting-point of an impure life, and when once they have admitted these
temptations, all the forces of their feeling are turned in that
direction, and, to take again our illustration of the stream, they let
it rush from the diviner channel into low material channels, and make
within themselves a broad path for passion; so that the stream of their
love leaves dry the abandoned channel of the higher way <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[1391](#fn_1389.md) and flows abroad in indulgence. It
would be well then, we take it, for the weaker brethren to fly to
virginity as into an impregnable fortress, rather than to descend into
the career of life’s consequences and invite temptations to do their
worst upon them, entangling themselves in those things which through the
lusts of the flesh war against the law of our mind; it would be well for
them to consider <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1392](#fn_1390.md) that herein
they risk not broad acres, or wealth, or any other of this life’s
prizes, but the hope which has been their guide. It is impossible that
one who has turned to the world and feels its anxieties, and engages his
heart in the wish to please men, can fulfil that first and great
commandment of the Master, “Thou shalt love God with all thy heart and
with all thy strength <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1393](#fn_1391.md) .” How
can he fulfil that, when he divides his heart between God and the world,
and exhausts the love which he owes to Him alone in human affections?
“He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord; but he that is
married careth for the things that are of the world <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1394](#fn_1392.md) .” If the combat with pleasure
seems wearisome, nevertheless let all take heart. Habit will not fail to
produce, even in the seemingly most fretful <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1395](#fn_1393.md) , a feeling of pleasure through the
very effort of their perseverance; and that pleasure will be of the
noblest and purest kind; which the intelligent may well be enamoured of,
rather than allow themselves, with aims narrowed by the lowness of their
objects, to be estranged from the true greatness which goes beyond all
thought.
