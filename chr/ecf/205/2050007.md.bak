<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="vii.i-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.i-p3.1"></span>Chapter I.—<span class="c22"><span
id="vii.i-p3.2"></span>A Sketch of the Life of S. Gregory of
Nyssa</span>.</span>

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.i-p4.1"></span>In</span> the roll of the Nicene Fathers there is
no more honoured name than that of Gregory of Nyssa. Besides the praises
of his great brother Basil and of his equally great friend Gregory
Nazianzen, the sanctity of his life, his theological learning, and his
strenuous advocacy of the faith embodied in the Nicene clauses, have
received the praises of Jerome, Socrates, Theodoret, and many other
Christian writers. Indeed such was the estimation in which he was held
that some did not hesitate to call him ‘the Father of Fathers’ as well
as ‘the Star of Nyssa’ <span id="fr_2"></span>[4](#fn_2.md) .”

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span>Gregory of Nyssa was equally fortunate in his
country, the name he bore, and the family which produced him. He was a
native of Cappadocia, and was born most probably at Cæsarea, the
capital, about <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.i-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 335 or 336. No province of the Roman
Empire had in those early ages received more eminent Christian bishops
than Cappadocia and the adjoining district of Pontus.

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span>In the previous century the great prelate
Firmilian, the disciple and friend of Origen, who visited him at his
See, had held the Bishopric of Cæsarea. In the same age another saint,
Gregory Thaumaturgus, a friend also and disciple of Origen, was bishop
of Neo-Cæsarea in Pontus. During the same century, too, no less than
four other Gregories shed more or less lustre on bishoprics in that
country. The family of Gregory of Nyssa was one of considerable wealth
and distinction, and one also conspicuously Christian.

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span>During the Diocletian persecution his
grandparents had fled for safety to the mountainous region of Pontus,
where they endured great hardships and privations. It is said that his
maternal grandfather, whose name is unknown, eventually lost both life
and property. After a retirement of some few years the family appear to
have returned and settled at Cæsarea in Cappadocia, or else at
Neo-Cæsarea in Pontus, for there is some uncertainty in the account.

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>Gregory’s father, Basil, who gave his name to
his eldest son, was known as a rhetorician. He died at a comparatively
early age, leaving a family of ten children, five of whom were boys and
five girls, under the care of their grandmother Macrina and mother
Emmelia. Both of these illustrious ladies were distinguished for the
earnestness and strictness of their Christian principles, to which the
latter added the charm of great personal beauty.

<span id="vii.i-p10"></span>All the sons and daughters appear to have
been of high character, but it is only of four sons and one daughter
that we have any special record. The daughter, called Macrina, from her
grandmother, was the angel in the house of this illustrious family. She
shared with her grandmother and mother the care and education of all its
younger members. Nor was there <span id="page_II">p. II</span> <span
id="vii.i-Page_II"></span>one of them who did not owe to her religious
influence their settlement in the faith and consistency of Christian
conduct.

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span>This admirable woman had been betrothed in
early life, but her intended husband died of fever. She permitted
herself to contract no other alliance, but regarded herself as still
united to her betrothed in the other world. She devoted herself to a
religious life, and eventually, with her mother Emmelia, established a
female conventual society on the family-property in Pontus, at a place
called Annesi, on the banks of the river Iris.

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>It was owing to her persuasions that her
brother Basil also gave up the worldly life, and retired to lead the
devout life in a wild spot in the immediate neighbourhood of Annesi.
Here for a while he was an hermit, and here he persuaded his friend
Gregory Nazianzen to join him. They studied together the works of
Origen, and published a selection of extracts from his Commentaries,
which they called “Philocalia.” By the suggestions of a friend Basil
enlarged his idea, and converted his hermit’s seclusion into a
monastery, which eventually became the centre of many others which
sprung up in that district.

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span>His inclination for the monastic life had
been greatly influenced by his acquaintance with the Egyptian monks, who
had impressed him with the value of their system as an aid to a life of
religious devotion. He had visited also the hermit saints of Syria and
Arabia, and learnt from them the practice of a severe asceticism, which
both injured his health and shortened his days.

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span>Gregory of Nyssa was the third son, and one
of the youngest of the family. He had an elder brother, Nectarius, who
followed the profession of their father, and became rhetorician, and
like him died early. He had also a younger brother, Peter, who became
bishop of Sebaste.

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span>Besides the uncertainty as to the year and
place of his birth it is not known where he received his education. From
the weakness of his health and delicacy of his constitution, it was most
probably at home. It is interesting, in the case of one so highly
educated, to know who, in consequence of his father’s early death, took
charge of his merely intellectual bringing up: and his own words do not
leave us in any doubt that, so far as he had a teacher, it was Basil,
his senior by several years. He constantly speaks of him as the revered
‘Master:’ to take but one instance, he says in his *Hexaemeron (ad
init.)* that all that will be striking in that work will be due to
Basil, what is inferior will be the ‘pupil’s.’ Even in the matter of
style, he says in a letter written in early life to Libanius that though
he enjoyed his brother’s society but a short time yet Basil was the
author of his oratory (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p15.1"></span>λόγου</span>): and it is safe to conclude that
he was introduced to all that Athens had to teach, perhaps even to
medicine, by Basil: for Basil had been at Athens. On the other hand we
can have no difficulty in crediting his mother, of whom he always spoke
with the tenderest affection, and his admirable sister Macrina, with the
care of his religious teaching. Indeed few could be more fortunate than
Gregory in the influences of home. If, as there is every reason to
believe, the grandmother Macrina survived Gregory’s early childhood,
then, like Timothy, he was blest with the religious instruction of
another Lois and Eunice.

<span id="vii.i-p16"></span>In this chain of female relationship it is
difficult to say which link is worthier of note, grandmother, mother, or
daughter. Of the first, Basil, who attributes his early religious
impressions to his grandmother, tells us that as a child she taught him
a Creed, which had been drawn up for the use of the Church of
Neo-Cæsarea by Gregory Thaumaturgus. This Creed, it is said, was
revealed to the Saint in a vision. It has been translated by Bishop Bull
in his “Fidei Nicænæ Defensio.” In its language and spirit it
anticipates the Creed of Constantinople.

<span id="vii.i-p17"></span>Certain it is that Gregory had not the
benefit of a residence at Athens, or of foreign travel. It might have
given him a strength of character and width of experience, in which he
was certainly deficient. His shy and retiring disposition induced him to
remain at home <span id="page_III">p. III</span> <span
id="vii.i-Page_III"></span>without choosing a profession, living on his
share of the paternal property, and educating himself by a discipline of
his own.

<span id="vii.i-p18"></span>He remained for years unbaptized. And this
is a very noticeable circumstance which meets us in the lives of many
eminent Saints and Bishops of the Church. They either delayed baptism
themselves, or it was delayed for them. Indeed there are instances of
Bishops baptized and consecrated the same day.

<span id="vii.i-p19"></span>Gregory’s first inclination or impulse to
make a public profession of Christianity is said to have been due to a
remarkable dream or vision.

<span id="vii.i-p20"></span>His mother Emmelia, at her retreat at
Annesi, urgently entreated him to be present and take part in a
religious ceremony in honour of the Forty Christian Martyrs. He had gone
unwillingly, and wearied with his journey and the length of the service,
which lasted far into the night, he lay down and fell asleep in the
garden. He dreamed that the Martyrs appeared to him and, reproaching him
for his indifference, beat him with rods. On awaking he was filled with
remorse, and hastened to amend his past neglect by earnest entreaties
for mercy and forgiveness. Under the influence of the terror which his
dream inspired he consented to undertake the office of reader in the
Church, which of course implied a profession of Christianity. But some
unfitness, and, perhaps, that love of eloquence which clung to him to
the last, soon led him to give up the office, and adopt the profession
of a rhetorician or advocate. For this desertion of a sacred for a
secular employment he is taken severely to task by his brother Basil and
his friend Gregory Nazianzen. The latter does not hesitate to charge him
with being influenced, not by conscientious scruples, but by vanity and
desire of public display, a charge not altogether consistent with his
character.

<span id="vii.i-p21"></span>Here it is usual to place the marriage of
Gregory with Theosebeia, said to have been a sister of Gregory
Nazianzen. Certainly the tradition of Gregory’s marriage received such
credit as to be made in after times a proof of the non-celibacy of the
Bishops of his age. But it rests mainly on two passages, which taken
separately are not in the least conclusive. The first is the
ninety-fifth letter of Gregory Nazianzen, written to console for a
certain loss by death, i.e. of “Theosebeia, the fairest, the most
lustrous even amidst such beauty of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.2"></span>δελφοὶ</span>; Theosebeia, the true priestess,
the yokefellow and the equal of a priest.” J. Rupp has well pointed out
that the expression ‘yokefellow’ (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.3"></span>σύζυγον</span>), which has been insisted as
meaning ‘wife,’ may, especially in the language of Gregory Nazianzen, be
equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.4"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.5"></span>δελφὸς</span>. He sees in this Theosebeia ‘a
sister of the Cappadocian brothers.’ The second passage is contained in
the third cap. of Gregory’s treatise *On Virginity*. Gregory there
complains that he is “cut off by a kind of gulf from this glory of
virginity” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.6"></span>παρθενία</span>). The whole passage should be
consulted. Of course its significance depends on the meaning given to
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.i-p21.7"></span>παρθενία</span>. Rupp
asserts that more and more towards the end of the century this word
acquired a technical meaning derived from the purely ideal side, i.e.
virginity of soul: and that Gregory is alluding to the same thing that
his friend had not long before blamed him for, the keeping of a school
for rhetoric, where his object had been merely worldly reputation, and
the truly ascetic career had been marred (at the time he wrote).
Certainly the terrible indictment of marriage in the third cap. of this
treatise comes ill from one whose wife not only must have been still
living, but possessed the virtues sketched in the letter of Gregory
Nazianzen: while the allusions at the end of it to the law-courts and
their revelations appear much more like the professional reminiscence of
a rhetorician who must have been familiar with them, than the personal
complaint of one who had cause to depreciate marriage. The powerful
words of Basil, de Virgin. I. 610, a. b., also favour the above view of
the meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.8"></span>παρθενία</span>: and Gregory elsewhere
distinctly calls celibacy <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.9"></span>παρθενία τοῦ σώματος</span>, and regards it as a
means only to this higher <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.10"></span>παρθενια</span> (III. 131). But the two
passages above, when combined, may have led to the tradition of
Gregory’s marriage. Nicephorus Callistus, for example, who first makes
mention of it, must have put upon <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.i-p21.11"></span>παρθενία</span> the interpretation of his own
time (thirteenth century,) <span id="page_IV">p. IV</span> <span
id="vii.i-Page_IV"></span>i.e. that of continence. Finally, those who
adopt this tradition have still to account for the fact that no allusion
to Theosebeia as his wife, and no letter to her, is to be found in
Gregory’s numerous writings. It is noteworthy that the Benedictine
editors of Gregory Nazianzen (ad Epist. 95) also take the above view.

<span id="vii.i-p22"></span>His final recovery and conversion to the
Faith, of which he was always after so strenuous an asserter, was due to
her who, all things considered, was the master spirit of the family. By
the powerful persuasions of his sister Macrina, at length, after much
struggle, he altered entirely his way of life, severed himself from all
secular occupations, and retired to his brother’s monastery in the
solitudes of Pontus, a beautiful spot, and where, as we have seen, his
mother and sister had established, in the immediate neighbourhood, a
similar association for women.

<span id="vii.i-p23"></span>Here, then, Gregory was settled for several
years, and devoted himself to the study of the Scripture and the works
of his master Origen. Here, too, his love of natural scenery was
deepened so as to find afterwards constant and adequate expression. For
in his writings we have in large measure that sentiment of delight in
the beauty of nature of which, even when it was felt, the traces are so
few and far between in the whole range of Greek literature. A notable
instance is the following from the *Letter to Adelphus*, written long
afterwards:—“The gifts bestowed upon the spot by Nature, who beautifies
the earth with an impromptu grace, are such as these: below, the river
Halys makes the place fair to look upon with his banks, and glides like
a golden ribbon through their deep purple, reddening his current with
the soil he washes down. Above, a mountain densely overgrown with wood
stretches, with its long ridge, covered at all points with the foliage
of oaks, more worthy of finding some Homer to sing its praises than that
Ithacan Neritus which the poet calls ‘far-seen with quivering leaves.’
But the natural growth of wood as it comes down the hill-side meets at
the foot the plantations of human husbandry. For forthwith vines, spread
out over the slopes and swellings and hollows at the mountain’s base,
cover with their colour, like a green mantle, all the lower ground: and
the season also was now adding to their beauty with a display of
magnificent grape-clusters.” Another is from the treatise *On Infants’
Early Deaths*:—“Nay look only at an ear of corn, at the germinating of
some plant, at a ripe bunch of grapes, at the beauty of early autumn
whether in fruit or flower, at the grass springing unbidden, at the
mountain reaching up with its summit to the height of the ether, at the
springs of the lower ground bursting from its flanks in streams like
milk, and running in rivers through the glens, at the sea receiving
those streams from every direction and yet remaining within its limits
with waves edged by the stretches of beach, and never stepping beyond
those fixed boundaries: and how can the eye of reason fail to find in
them all that our education for Realities requires?” The treatise *On
Virginity* was the fruit of this life in Basil’s monastery.

<span id="vii.i-p24"></span>Henceforward the fortunes of Gregory are
more closely linked with those of his great brother Basil.

<span id="vii.i-p25"></span>About <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.i-p25.1"></span>a.d.</span> 365 Basil was summoned from his
retirement to act as coadjutor to Eusebius, the Metropolitan of Cæsarea
in Cappadocia, and aid him in repelling the assaults of the Arian
faction on the Faith. In these assaults the Arians were greatly
encouraged and assisted by the proclivities of the Emperor Valens. After
some few years of strenuous and successful resistance, and the endurance
of great persecution from the Emperor and his Court, a persecution which
indeed pursued him through life, Basil is called by the popular voice,
on the death of Eusebius, <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.i-p25.2"></span>a.d.</span> 370, to succeed him in the See. His
election is vehemently opposed, but after much turmoil is at length
accomplished.

<span id="vii.i-p26"></span>To strengthen himself in his position, and
surround himself with defenders of the orthodox Faith, he obliges his
brother Gregory, in spite of his emphatic protest, to undertake the
Bishopric of Nyssa <span id="fr_3"></span>[5](#fn_3.md) , a small town in
the west of Cappadocia. When a friend expressed his surprise that he had
chosen so obscure a place for such a man as Gregory, he replied, that
<span id="page_V">p. V</span> <span id="vii.i-Page_V"></span>he did not
desire his brother to receive distinction from the name of his See, but
rather to confer distinction upon it.

<span id="vii.i-p28"></span>It was with the same feeling, and by the
exercise of a like masterful will, that he forced upon his friend
Gregory Nazianzen the Bishopric of a still more obscure and unimportant
place, called Sasima. But Gregory highly resented the nomination, which
unhappily led to a lifelong estrangement.

<span id="vii.i-p29"></span>It was about this time, too, that a quarrel
had arisen between Basil and their uncle, another Gregory, one of the
Cappadocian Bishops. And here Gregory of Nyssa gave a striking proof of
the extreme simplicity and unreflectiveness of his character, which
without guileful intent yet led him into guile. Without sufficient
consideration he was induced to practise a deceit which was as
irreconcileable with Christian principle as with common sense. In his
endeavours to set his brother and uncle at one, when previous efforts
had been in vain, he had recourse to an extraordinary method. He forged
a letter, as if from their uncle, to Basil, earnestly entreating
reconciliation. The inevitable discovery of course only widened the
breach, and drew down on Gregory his brother’s indignant condemnation.
The reconciliation, however, which Gregory hoped for, was afterwards
brought about.

<span id="vii.i-p30"></span>Nor was this the only occasion on which
Gregory needed Basil’s advice and reproof, and protection from the
consequences of his inexperienced zeal. After he had become Bishop of
Nyssa, with a view to render assistance to his brother he promoted the
summoning of Synods. But Basil’s wider experience told him that no good
would come of such assemblies under existing circumstances. Besides
which he had reason to believe that Gregory would be made the tool of
factious and designing men. He therefore discouraged the attempt. At
another time Basil had to interpose his authority to prevent his brother
joining in a mission to Rome to invite the interference of Pope Damasus
and the Western Bishops in the settlement of the troubles at Antioch in
consequence of the disputed election to the See. Basil had himself
experience of the futility of such application to Rome, from the want of
sympathy in the Pope and the Western Bishops with the troubles in the
East. Nor would he, by such application, give a handle for Rome’s
assertion of supremacy, and encroachment on the independence of the
Eastern Church. The Bishopric of Nyssa was indeed to Gregory no bed of
roses. Sad was the contrast to one of his genre spirit, more fitted for
studious retirement and monastic calm than for controversies which did
not end with the pen, between the peaceful leisure of his retreat in
Pontus and the troubles and antagonisms of his present position. The
enthusiasm of his faith on the subject of the Trinity and the
Incarnation brought upon him the full weight of Arian and Sabellian
hostility, aggravated as it was by the patronage of the Emperor. In fact
his whole life at Nyssa was a series of persecutions.

<span id="vii.i-p31"></span>A charge of uncanonical irregularity in his
ordination is brought up against him by certain Arian Bishops, and he is
summoned to appear and answer them at a Synod at Ancyra. To this was
added the vexation of a prosecution by Demosthenes, the Emperor’s *chef
de cuisine*, on a charge of defalcation in the Church funds.

<span id="vii.i-p32"></span>A band of soldiers is sent to fetch him to
the Synod. The fatigue of the journey, and the rough treatment of his
conductors, together with anxiety of mind, produce a fever which
prevents his attendance. His brother Basil comes to his assistance. He
summons another Synod of orthodox Cappadocian Bishops, who dictate in
their joint names a courteous letter, apologising for Gregory’s absence
from the Synod of Ancyra, and proving the falsehood of the charge of
embezzlement. At the same time he writes to solicit the interest of
Astorgus, a person of considerable influence at the Court, to save his
brother from the indignity of being dragged before a secular tribunal.

<span id="vii.i-p33"></span>Apparently the application was unsuccessful.
Demosthenes now obtains the holding another Synod at Gregory’s own See
of Nyssa, where he is summoned to answer the same charges. Gregory
refuses to attend. He is consequently pronounced contumacious, and <span
id="page_VI">p. VI</span> <span id="vii.i-Page_VI"></span>deposed from
his Bishopric. His deposition is followed immediately by a decree of
banishment from the Emperor, <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.i-p33.1"></span>a.d.</span> 376. He retires to Seleucia. But his
banishment did not secure him from the malice and persecution of his
enemies. He is obliged frequently to shift his quarters, and is
subjected to much bodily discomfort and suffering. From the consoling
answers of his friend Gregory of Nazianzen (for his own letters are
lost), we learn the crushing effects of all these troubles upon his
gentle and sensitive spirit, and the deep despondency into which he had
fallen.

<span id="vii.i-p34"></span>At length there is a happier turn of
affairs. The Emperor Valens is killed, <span class="c22"><span
id="vii.i-p34.1"></span>a.d.</span> 378, and with him Arianism ‘vanished
in the crash of Hadrianople.’ He is succeeded by Gratian, the friend and
disciple of St. Ambrose. The banished orthodox Bishops are restored to
their Sees, and Gregory returns to Nyssa. In <span
id="fr_4"></span>[6](#fn_4.md) one of his letters, most probably to his
brother Basil, he gives a graphic description of the popular triumph
with which his return was greeted.

<span id="vii.i-p36"></span>But the joy of his restoration is
overshadowed by domestic sorrows. His great brother, to whom he owed so
much, soon after dies, ere he is 50 years of age, worn out by his
unparalleled toils and the severity of his ascetic life. Gregory
celebrated his death in a sincere panegyric. Its high-flown style is
explained by the rhetorical fashion of the time. The same year another
sorrow awaits him. After a separation of many years he revisits his
sister Macrina, at her convent in Pontus, but only to find her on her
death-bed. We have an interesting and graphic account of the scene
between Gregory and his dying sister. To the last this admirable woman
appears as the great teacher of her family. She supplies her brother
with arguments for, and confirms his faith in, the resurrection of the
dead; and almost reproves him for the distress he felt at her departure,
bidding him, with St. Paul, not to sorrow as those who had no hope.
After her decease an inmate of the convent, named Vestiana, brought to
Gregory a ring, in which was a piece of the true Cross, and an iron
cross, both of which were found on the body when laying it out. One
Gregory retained himself, the other he gave to Vestiana. He buried his
sister in the chapel at Annesi, in which her parents and her brother
Naucratius slept.

<span id="vii.i-p37"></span>From henceforth the labours of Gregory have
a far more extended range. He steps into the place vacated by the death
of Basil, and takes foremost rank among the defenders of the Faith of
Nicæa. He is not, however, without trouble still from the heretical
party. Certain Galatians had been busy in sowing the seeds of their
heresy among his own people. He is subjected, too, to great annoyance
from the disturbances which arose out of the wish of the people of Ibera
in Pontus to have him as their Bishop. In that early age of the Church
election to a Bishopric, if not dependent on the popular voice, at least
called forth the expression of much popular feeling, like a contested
election amongst ourselves. This often led to breaches of the peace,
which required military intervention to suppress them, as it appears to
have done on this occasion.

<span id="vii.i-p38"></span>But the reputation of Gregory is now so
advanced, and the weight of his authority as an eminent teacher so
generally acknowledged, that we find him as one of the Prelates at the
Synod of Antioch assembled for the purpose of healing the long-continued
schisms in that distracted See. By the same Synod Gregory is chosen to
visit and endeavour to reform the Churches of Arabia and Babylon, which
had fallen into a very corrupt and degraded state. He gives a lamentable
account of their condition, as being beyond all his powers of
reformation. On this same journey he visits Jerusalem and its sacred
scenes: it has been conjectured that the Apollinarian heresy drew him
thither. Of the Church of Jerusalem he can give no better account than
of those he had already visited. He expresses himself as greatly
scandalized at the conduct of the Pilgrims who visited the Holy City on
the plea of religion. Writing to three ladies, whom he had known at
Jerusalem, he takes occasion, from what he had witnessed there, to speak
of the uselessness of pilgrimages as any aids to <span id="page_VII">p.
VII</span> <span id="vii.i-Page_VII"></span>reverence and faith, and
denounces in the strongest terms the moral dangers to which all
pilgrims, especially women, are exposed.

<span id="vii.i-p39"></span>This letter is so condemnatory of what was a
common and authorized practice of the medieval Church that <span
id="fr_5"></span>[7](#fn_5.md) Divines of the Latin communion have
endeavoured, but in vain, to deny its authenticity.

<span id="vii.i-p41"></span>The name and character of Gregory had now
reached the Imperial Court, where Theodosius had lately succeeded to the
Eastern Empire. As a proof of the esteem in which he was then held, it
is said that in his recent journey to Babylon and the Holy Land he
travelled with carriages provided for him by the Emperor.

<span id="vii.i-p42"></span>Still greater distinction awaits him. He is
one of the hundred and fifty Bishops summoned by Theodosius to the
second Œcumenical Council, that of Constantinople, <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.i-p42.1"></span>a.d.</span> 381. To the
assembled Fathers he brings an <span id="fr_6"></span>[8](#fn_6.md)
instalment of his treatise against the Eunomian heresy, which he had
written in defence of his brother Basil’s positions, on the subject of
the Trinity and the Incarnation. This he first read to his friend
Gregory Nazianzen, Jerome, and others. Such was the influence he
exercised in the Council that it is said, though this is very doubtful,
that the explanatory clauses added to the Nicene Creed are due to him.
Certain, however, it is that he delivered the inaugural address, which
is not extant; further that he preached the funeral oration, which has
been preserved, on the death of Meletius, of Antioch, the first
President of the Council, who died at Constantinople; also that he
preached at the enthronement of Gregory Nazianzen in the capital. This
oration has perished.

<span id="vii.i-p44"></span>Shortly before the close of the Council, by
a Constitution of the Emperor, issued from Heraclea, Gregory is
nominated as one of the Bishops who were to be regarded as the central
authorities of Catholic Communion. In other words, the primacy of Rome
or Alexandria in the East was to be replaced by that of other Sees,
especially Constantinople. Helladius of Cæsarea was to be Gregory’s
colleague in his province. The connexion led to a misunderstanding. As
to the grounds of this there is much uncertainty. The account of it is
entirely derived from Gregory himself in his *Letter to Flavian*, and
from his great namesake. Possibly there were faults on both sides.

<span id="vii.i-p45"></span>We do not read of Gregory being at the
Synod, <span class="c22"><span id="vii.i-p45.1"></span>a.d.</span> 382,
which followed the great Council of Constantinople. But we find him
present at the Synod held the following year.

<span id="vii.i-p46"></span>This same year we have proof of the
continued esteem and favour shown him by the Imperial Court. He is
chosen to pronounce the funeral oration on the infant Princess
Pulcheria. And not long after that also on the death of the Empress
Flaccilla, or Placidia, herself. This last was a magnificent eulogy, but
one, according to Tillemont, even surpassed by that of Theodoret. This
admirable and holy woman, a saint of the Eastern Church, fully warranted
all the praise that could be bestowed upon her. If her husband
Theodosius did not owe his conversion to Christianity to her example and
influence, he certainly did his adherence to the true Faith. It is one
of the subjects of Gregory’s praise of her that by her persuasion the
Emperor refused to give an interview to the ‘rationalist of the fourth
century,’ Eunomius.

<span id="vii.i-p47"></span>Scarcely anything is known of the latter
years of Gregory of Nyssa’s life. The last record we have of him is that
he was present at a Synod of Constantinople, summoned <span
class="c22"><span id="vii.i-p47.1"></span>a.d.</span> 394, by Rufinus,
the powerful prefect of the East, under the presidency of Nectarius. The
rival claims to the See of Bostra in Arabia had to be then settled; but
perhaps the chief reason for summoning this assembly was to glorify the
consecration of Rufinus’ new Church in the suburbs. It was there that
Gregory delivered the sermon which was probably his last, wrongly
entitled *‘On his Ordination.’* His words, which heighten the effect of
others then preached, are humbly compared to the blue circles painted on
the new walls as a foil to the gilded dome above. “The whole breathes a
calmer and more peaceful spirit; the deep sorrow over heretics <span
id="page_VIII">p. VIII</span> <span id="vii.i-Page_VIII"></span>who
forfeit the blessings of the Spirit changes only here and there into the
flashes of a short-lived indignation.” (J. Rupp.)

<span id="vii.i-p48"></span>The prophecy of Basil had come true. Nyssa
was ennobled by the name of its bishop appearing on the roll of this
Synod, between those of the Metropolitans of Cæsarea and Iconium. Even
in outward rank he is equal to the highest. The character of Gregory
could not be more justly drawn than in the words of Tillemont (IX. p.
269). “Autant en effet, qu’on peut juger de lui par ses écrits, c‘étoit
un esprit doux, bon, facile, qui avec beaucoup d’élevation et de
lumière, avoit néanmois beaucoup de simplicité et de candeur, qui aimoit
plus le repos que l’action, et le travail du cabinet que le tumulte des
affaires, qui avec cela étoit sans faste, disposé à estimer et à louer
les autres et à se mettre à dessous d’eux. Mais quoiqu’ il ne cherchât
que le repos, nous avons vû que son zèle pour ses frères l’avoit souvent
engagé à de grands travaux, et que Dieu avait honoré sa simplicité en le
faisant regarder comme le maitre, le docteur, le pacificateur et
l’arbitre des églises.”

<span id="vii.i-p49"></span>His death (probably 395) is commemorated by
the Greek Church on January 10, by the Latin on March 9.
