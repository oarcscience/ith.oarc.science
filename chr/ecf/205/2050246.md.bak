<span id="xi.ii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Still</span>, in his examination of the
amount of justice and wisdom discoverable in this Dispensation a person
is, perhaps, induced to entertain the thought that it was by means of a
certain amount of deceit that God carried out this scheme on our behalf.
For that not by pure Deity alone, but by Deity veiled in human nature,
God, without the knowledge of His enemy, got within the lines of him who
had man in his power, is in some measure a fraud and a surprise; seeing
that it is the peculiar way with those who want to deceive to divert in
another direction the expectations of their intended victims, and then
to effect something quite different from what these latter expected. But
he who has regard for truth will agree that the essential qualities of
justice and wisdom are before all things these; viz. of justice, to give
to every one according to his due; of wisdom, not to pervert justice,
and yet at the same time not to dissociate the benevolent aim of the
love of mankind from the verdict of justice, but skilfully to combine
both these requisites together, in regard to justice <span
id="fr_2001"></span>[2003](#fn_2001.md) returning the due recompense, in
regard to kindness not swerving from the aim of that love of man. Let us
see, then, whether these two qualities are not to be observed in that
which took place. That repayment, adequate to the debt, by which the
deceiver was in his turn deceived, exhibits the justice of the dealing,
while the object aimed at is a testimony to the goodness of Him who
effected it. It is, indeed, the property of justice to assign to every
one those particular results of which he has sunk already the
foundations and the causes, just as the earth returns its harvests
according to the kinds of seeds thrown into it; while it is the property
of wisdom, in its very manner of giving equivalent returns, not to
depart from the kinder course. Two persons may both mix poison with
food, one with the design of taking life, the other with the design of
saving that life; the one using it as a poison, the other only as an
antidote to poison; and in no way does the manner of the cure adopted
spoil the aim and purpose of the benefit intended; for although a
mixture of poison with the food may be effected by both of these persons
alike, yet looking at their intention we are indignant with the one and
approve the other; so in this instance, by the reasonable rule of
justice, he who practised deception receives in return that very
treatment, the seeds of which he had himself sown of his own free will.
He who first deceived man by the bait of sensual pleasure is himself
deceived by the presentment of the human form. But as regards the aim
and purpose of what took place, a change in the direction of the nobler
is involved; for whereas he, the enemy, effected his deception for the
ruin of our nature, He Who is at once the just, and good, and wise one,
used His device, in which there was deception, for the salvation of him
who had perished, and thus not only conferred benefit on the lost one,
but on him, too, who had wrought our ruin. For from this approximation
of death to life, of darkness to light, of corruption to incorruption,
there is effected an obliteration of what is worse, and a passing away
of it into nothing, while benefit is conferred on him who is freed from
those evils. For it is as when some worthless material has been mixed
with gold, and the gold-refiners <span
id="fr_2002"></span>[2004](#fn_2002.md) burn up the foreign and refuse part
in the consuming fire, and so restore the more precious substance to its
natural lustre: (not that the separation is effected without difficulty,
for it takes time for the fire by its melting force to cause the baser
matter to disappear; but for all that, this melting away of the actual
thing that was embedded in it to the injury of its beauty is a kind of
healing of the gold.) In <span id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span
id="xi.ii.xxviii-Page_496"></span>the same way when death, and
corruption, and darkness, and every other offshoot of evil had grown
into the nature of the author of evil, the approach of the Divine power,
acting like fire <span id="fr_2003"></span>[2005](#fn_2003.md) , and making
that unnatural accretion to disappear, thus by purgation <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2006](#fn_2004.md) of the evil becomes a blessing to
that nature, though the separation is agonizing. Therefore even the
adversary himself will not be likely to dispute that what took place was
both just and salutary, that is, if he shall have attained to a
perception of the boon. For it is now as with those who for their cure
are subjected to the knife and the cautery; they are angry with the
doctors, and wince with the pain of the incision; but if recovery of
health be the result of this treatment, and the pain of the cautery
passes away, they will feel grateful to those who have wrought this cure
upon them. In like manner, when, after long periods of time, the evil of
our nature, which now is mixed up with it and has grown with its growth,
has been expelled, and when there has been a restoration of those who
are now lying in Sin to their primal state, a harmony of thanksgiving
will arise from all creation <span id="fr_2005"></span>[2007](#fn_2005.md)
, as well from those who in the process of the purgation have suffered
chastisement, as from those who needed not any purgation at all. These
and the like benefits the great mystery of the Divine incarnation
bestows. For in those points in which He was mingled with humanity,
passing as He did through all the accidents proper to human nature, such
as birth, rearing, growing up, and advancing even to the taste of death,
He accomplished all the results before mentioned, freeing both man from
evil, and healing even the introducer of evil himself. For the
chastisement, however painful, of moral disease is a healing of its
weakness.

(a dative of reference), which has no such verb after it. Krabinger
therefore hardly translates correctly “justitiæ quod datur, pro meritis

the curing of Satan.

three of Krabinger’s Codd. and that of Hervetus and Zinus; “purgatione,”
“purgationis”: the context too of the whole chapter seems to require it.
But Morell’s Cod. had <span class="Greek"><span

approved of retaining it. For this <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="xi.ii.xxviii-p7"></span> “Far otherwise was it with the great
thinkers of the early Church.…They realized that redemption was a means
to an end, and that end the reconsecration of the whole universe to God.
And so the very completeness of their grasp upon the Atonement led them
to dwell upon the cosmical significance of the Incarnation, its purpose
to ‘gather together all things in one.’ For it was an age in which the
problems of the universe were keenly felt.”—*Lux Mundi,* p. 134.
