<span id="xi.ii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Should</span> you, however, ask in what way
Deity is mingled with humanity, you will have occasion for a preliminary
inquiry as to what the coalescence is of soul with flesh. But supposing
you are ignorant of the way in which the soul is in union with the body,
do not suppose that that other question is bound to come within your
comprehension; rather, as in this case of the union of soul and body,
while we have reason to believe that the soul is something other than
the body, because the flesh when isolated from the soul becomes dead and
inactive, we have yet no exact knowledge of the method of the union, so
in that other inquiry of the union of Deity with manhood, while we are
quite aware that there is a distinction as regards degree of majesty
between the Divine and the mortal perishable nature, we are not capable
of detecting how the Divine and the human elements are mixed up
together. The miracles recorded permit us not to entertain a doubt <span
id="fr_1974"></span>[1976](#fn_1974.md) that God was born in the nature of
man. But how—this, as being a subject unapproachable by the processes of
reasoning, we decline to investigate. For though we believe, as we do,
that all the corporeal and intellectual creation derives its subsistence
from the incorporeal and uncreated Being, yet the *whence* or the *how*,
these we do not make a matter for examination along with our faith in
the thing itself. While we accept the fact, we pass by the manner of the
putting together of the Universe, as a subject which must not be
curiously handled, but one altogether ineffable and inexplicable.
