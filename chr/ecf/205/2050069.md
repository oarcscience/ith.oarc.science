<span id="viii.i.iv.x"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iv.x-p1"></span> §10. *He explains the phrase “The Lord
created Me,” and the argument about the origination of the Son, the
deceptive character of Eunomius’ reasoning, and the passage which says,
“My glory will I not give to another,” examining them from different
points of view.*

<span id="viii.i.iv.x-p2"></span>But of course they bring forward the
passage in the book of Proverbs which says, “The Lord created Me as the
beginning of His ways, for His works <span
id="fr_365"></span>[367](#fn_365.md) .” Now it would require a lengthy
discussion to explain fully the real meaning of the passage: still it
would be possible even in a few words to convey to well-disposed readers
the thought intended. Some of those who are accurately versed in
theology do say this, that the Hebrew text does not read “created,” and
we have ourselves read in more ancient copies “possessed” instead of
“created.” Now assuredly “possession” in the allegorical language of the
Proverbs marks that slave Who for our sakes “took upon Him the form of a
slave <span id="fr_366"></span>[368](#fn_366.md) .” But if any one should
allege in this passage the reading which prevails in the Churches, we do
not reject even the expression “created.” For this also in allegorical
language is intended to connote the “slave,” since, as the Apostle tells
us, “all creation is in bondage <span id="fr_367"></span>[369](#fn_367.md)
.” Thus we say that this expression, as well as the other, admits of an
orthodox interpretation. For He Who for our sakes became like as we are,
was in the last days truly *created*,—He Who in the beginning being Word
and God afterwards became Flesh and Man. For the nature of flesh is
created: and by partaking in it in all points like as we do, yet without
sin, He was created when He became man: and He was created “after
God <span id="fr_368"></span>[370](#fn_368.md) ,” not after man, as the
Apostle says, in a new manner and not according to human wont. For we
are taught that this “new man” was *created*—albeit of the Holy Ghost
and of the power of the Highest—whom Paul, the hierophant of unspeakable
mysteries, bids us to “put on,” using two phrases to express the garment
that is to be put on, saying in one place, “Put on the new man which
after God is created <span id="fr_369"></span>[371](#fn_369.md) ,” and in
another, “Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ <span
id="fr_370"></span>[372](#fn_370.md) .” For thus it is that He, Who said “I
am the Way <span id="fr_371"></span>[373](#fn_371.md) ,” becomes to us who
have put Him on the beginning of the ways of salvation, that He may make
us the work of His own hands, new modelling us from the evil mould of
sin once more to His own image. He is at once our foundation before the
world to come, according to the words of Paul, who says, “Other
foundation can no man lay than that is laid <span
id="fr_372"></span>[374](#fn_372.md) ,” and it is true that “before the
springs of the waters came forth, before the mountains were settled,
before He made the depths, and before all hills, He begetteth Me <span
id="fr_373"></span>[375](#fn_373.md) .” For it is possible, accord<span
id="page_CXVIII">p. CXVIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.x-Page_CXVIII"></span>ing to the usage of the Book of
Proverbs, for each of these phrases, taken in a tropical sense, to be
applied to the Word <span id="fr_374"></span>[376](#fn_374.md) . For the
great David calls righteousness the “mountains of God <span
id="fr_375"></span>[377](#fn_375.md) ,” His judgments “deeps <span
id="fr_376"></span>[378](#fn_376.md) ,” and the teachers in the Churches
“fountains,” saying “Bless God the Lord from the fountains of
Israel <span id="fr_377"></span>[379](#fn_377.md) ”; and guilelessness he
calls “hills,” as he shows when he speaks of their skipping like
lambs <span id="fr_378"></span>[380](#fn_378.md) . Before these therefore
is born in us He Who for our sakes was created as man, that of these
things also the creation may find place in us. But we may, I think, pass
from the discussion of these points, inasmuch as the truth has been
sufficiently pointed out in a few words to well-disposed readers; let us
proceed to what Eunomius says next.

<span id="viii.i.iv.x-p17"></span>“Existing in the Beginning,” he says,
“not without beginning.” In what fashion does he who plumes himself on
his superior discernment understand the oracles of God? He declares Him
Who was in the beginning Himself to have a beginning: and is not aware
that if He Who is in the beginning has a beginning, then the Beginning
itself must needs have another beginning. Whatever He says of the
beginning he must necessarily confess to be true of Him Who was in the
beginning: for how can that which is in the beginning be severed from
the beginning? and how can any one imagine a “was not” as preceding the
“was”? For however far one carries back one’s thought to apprehend the
beginning, one most certainly understands as one does so that the Word
which was in the beginning (inasmuch as It cannot be separated from the
beginning in which It is) does not at any point of time either begin or
cease its existence therein. Yet let no one be induced by these words of
mine to separate into two the one beginning we acknowledge. For the
beginning is most assuredly one, wherein is discerned, indivisibly, that
Word Who is completely united to the Father. He who thus thinks will
never leave heresy a loophole to impair his piety by the novelty of the
term “ungenerate.” But in Eunomius’ next propositions his statements are
like bread with a large admixture of sand. For by mixing his heretical
opinions with sound doctrines, he makes uneatable even that which is in
itself nutritious, by the gravel which he has mingled with it. For he
calls the Lord “living wisdom,” “operative truth,” subsistent power, and
“life”:—so far is the nutritious portion. But into these assertions he
instils the poison of heresy. For when he speaks of the “life” as
“generate” he makes a reservation by the implied opposition to the
“ungenerate” life, and does not affirm the Son to be the very Life. Next
he says:—“As Son of God, quickening the dead, the true light, the light
that lighteneth every man coming into the world <span
id="fr_379"></span>[381](#fn_379.md) , good, and the bestower of good
things.” All these things he offers for honey to the simple-minded,
concealing his deadly drug under the sweetness of terms like these. For
he immediately introduces, on the heels of these statements, his
pernicious principle, in the words “Not partitioning with Him that begat
Him His high estate, not dividing with another the essence of the
Father, but becoming by generation glorious, yea, the Lord of glory, and
receiving glory from the Father, not sharing His glory with the Father,
for the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable, as He hath said, ‘My
glory will I not give to another. <span
id="fr_380"></span>[382](#fn_380.md) ’” These are his deadly poisons, which
they alone can discover who have their souls’ senses trained so to do:
but the mortal mischief of the words is disclosed by their
conclusion:—Receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory with the
Father, for the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable, as He hath
said, ‘My glory will I not give to another.’ Who is that “other” to whom
God has said that He will not give His glory? The prophet speaks of the
adversary of God, and Eunomius refers the prophecy to the only begotten
God Himself! For when the prophet, speaking in the person of God, had
said, “My glory will I not give to another,” he added, “neither My
praise to graven images.” For when men were beguiled to offer to the
adversary of God the worship and adoration due to God alone, paying
homage in the representations of graven images to the enemy of God, who
appeared in many shapes amongst men in the forms furnished by idols, He
Who healeth them that are sick, in pity for men’s ruin, foretold by the
prophet the loving-kindness which in the latter days He would show in
the abolishing of idols, saying, “When My truth shall have been
manifested, My glory shall no more be given to another, nor My praise
bestowed upon graven images: for men, when they come to know My glory,
shall no more be in bondage to them that by nature are no gods.” All
therefore that the prophet says in the person of the Lord concerning the
power of the adversary, this fighter against God, refers to the Lord
Himself, Who spake these words by the prophet! Who among the tyrants is
recorded to have been such a persecutor of the faith as this? Who
maintained such blasphemy as this, that He Who, as we believe, was
manifested in the flesh for the salvation of our souls, is not very God,
but the adversary of God, who puts his <span id="page_CXIX">p.
CXIX</span> <span id="viii.i.iv.x-Page_CXIX"></span>guile into effect
against men by the instrumentality of idols and graven images? For it is
what was said of that adversary by the prophet that Eunomius transfers
to the only-begotten God, without so much as reflecting that it is the
Only-begotten Himself Who spoke these words by the prophet, as Eunomius
himself subsequently confesses when he says, “this is He Who spake by
the prophets.”

<span id="viii.i.iv.x-p20"></span>Why should I pursue this part of the
subject in more detail? For the words preceding also are tainted with
the same profanity—“receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory
with the Father, for the glory of the Almighty God is incommunicable.”
For my own part, even had his words referred to Moses who was glorified
in the ministration of the Law,—not even then should I have tolerated
such a statement, even if it be conceded that Moses, having no glory
from within, appeared completely glorious to the Israelites by the
favour bestowed on him from God. For the very glory that was bestowed on
the lawgiver was the glory of none other but of God Himself, which glory
the Lord in the Gospel bids all to seek, when He blames those who value
human glory highly and seek not the glory that cometh from God
only <span id="fr_381"></span>[383](#fn_381.md) . For by the fact that He
commanded them to seek the glory that cometh from the only God, He
declared the possibility of their obtaining what they sought. How then
is the glory of the Almighty incommunicable, if it is even our duty to
ask for the glory that cometh from the only God, and if, according to
our Lord’s word, “every one that asketh receiveth <span
id="fr_382"></span>[384](#fn_382.md) ?” But one who says concerning the
Brightness of the Father’s glory, that He has the glory by having
received it, says in effect that the Brightness of the glory is in
Itself devoid of glory, and needs, in order to become Himself at last
the Lord of some glory, to receive glory from another. How then are we
to dispose of the utterances of the Truth,—one which tells us that He
shall be seen in the glory of the Father <span
id="fr_383"></span>[385](#fn_383.md) , and another which says, “All things
that the Father hath are Mine <span id="fr_384"></span>[386](#fn_384.md) ”?
To whom ought the hearer to give ear? To him who says, “He that is, as
the Apostle says, the ‘heir of all things <span
id="fr_385"></span>[387](#fn_385.md) ’ that are in the Father, is without
part or lot in His Father’s glory”; or to Him Who declares that all
things that the Father hath, He Himself hath also? Now among the “all
things,” glory surely is included. Yet Eunomius says that the glory of
the Almighty is incommunicable. This view Joel does not attest, nor yet
the mighty Peter, who adopted, in his speech to the Jews, the language
of the prophet. For both the prophet and the apostle say, in the person
of God,—“I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh <span
id="fr_386"></span>[388](#fn_386.md) .” He then Who did not grudge the
partaking in His own Spirit to all flesh,—how can it be that He does not
impart His own glory to the only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of
the Father, Who has all things that the Father has? Perhaps one should
say that Eunomius is here speaking the truth, though not intending it.
For the term “impart” is strictly used in the case of one who has not
his glory from within, whose possession of it is an accession from
without, and not part of his own nature: but where one and the same
nature is observed in both Persons, He Who is as regards nature all that
the Father is believed to be stands in no need of one to impart to Him
each several attribute. This it will be well to explain more clearly and
precisely. He Who has the Father dwelling in Him in His entirety—what
need has He of the Father’s glory, when none of the attributes
contemplated in the Father is withdrawn from Him?

[Next: After expounding the high estate of the Almighty, the Eternity of
the Son, and the phrase “being made obedient,” he shows the folly of
Eunomius in his assertion that the Son did not acquire His sonship by
obedience.](2050070.md)
