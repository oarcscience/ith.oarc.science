<span id="viii.i.iii.xx-p1"></span> §20. *He does wrong in assuming, to
account for the existence of the Only-Begotten, an ‘energy’ that
produced Christ’s Person.*

<span id="viii.i.iii.xx-p2"></span>That such is his intention in using
these phrases will be clear from what follows, where he more plainly
materializes and degrades our conception of the Son and of the Spirit.
“As the energies are bounded by the works, and the works commensurate
with the energies, it necessarily follows that these energies which
accompany these Beings are relatively greater and less, some being of a
higher, some of a lower order.” Though he has studiously wrapt the mist
of his phraseology round the meaning of this, and made it hard for most
to find out, yet as following that which we have already examined it
will easily be made clear. “The energies,” he says, “are bounded by the
works.” By ‘works’ he means the Son and the Spirit, by ‘energies’ the
efficient powers by which they were produced, which powers, he said a
little above, ‘follow’ the Beings. The phrase ‘bounded by’ expresses the
balance which exists between the being produced and the producing power,
or rather the ‘energy’ of that power, to use his own word implying that
the thing produced is not the effect of the whole power of the operator,
but only of a particular energy of it, only so much of the whole power
being exerted as is calculated to be likely to be equal to effect that
result. Then he inverts his statement: “and the works are commensurate
with the energies of the operators.” The meaning of this will be made
clearer by an illustration. Let us think of one of the tools of a
shoemaker: i.e., a leather-cutter. When it is moved round upon that from
which a certain shape has to be cut, the part so excised is limited by
the size of the instrument, and a circle of such a radius will be cut as
the instrument possesses of length, and, to put the matter the other
way, the span of the instrument will measure and cut out a corresponding
circle. That is the idea which our theologian has of the divine person
of the Only-begotten. He declares that a certain ‘energy’ which
‘follows’ upon the first Being produced, in the fashion of such a tool,
a corresponding work, namely our Lord: this is his way of glorifying the
Son of God, Who is even now glorified in the glory of the Father, and
shall be revealed in the Day of Judgment. He is a ‘work commensurate
with the producing energy.’ But what is this energy which ‘follows’ the
Almighty and is to be conceived of prior to the Only-begotten, and which
circumscribes His being? A certain essential Power, self-subsisting,
which works its will by a spontaneous impulse. It is this, then, that is
the real Father of our Lord. And why do we go on talking of the Almighty
as the Father, if it was not He, but an energy belonging to the things
which follow Him externally that produced the Son: and how can the Son
be a son any longer, when something else has given Him existence
according to Eunomius, and He creeps like a bastard (may our Lord pardon
the expression!) into relationship with the Father, and is to be
honoured in name only as a Son? How can Eunomius rank our Lord next
after the Almighty at all, when he counts Him third only, with that
mediating ‘energy’ placed in the second place? The Holy Spirit also
according to this sequence will be found not in the third, but in the
fifth place, that ‘energy’ which follows the Only-Begotten, and by which
the Holy Spirit came into existence necessarily intervening between
them.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xx-p3"></span>Thereby, too, the creation of all
things by the Son <span id="fr_113"></span>[115](#fn_113.md) will be found
to have no foundation: another personality, prior to Him, has been
invented by our neologian, to which the authorship of the world must be
referred, because the Son Himself derives His being according to them
from that ‘energy.’ If, however, to avoid such profanities, he makes
this ‘energy’ which produced the Son into something unsubstantial, he
will have to explain to us how non-being can ‘follow’ being, and how
what is not a substance can produce a substance: for, if he did that, we
shall find an unreality following God, the non-existent author of all
existence, the radically unsubstantial circumscribing a substantial
nature, the operative force of creation contained, in the last resort,
in the unreal. Such is the result of the teaching of this theologian who
affirms of the Lord Artificer of heaven and earth and of all the
Creation, the Word of God Who was in the beginning, through Whom are all
things, that He owes His existence to such a baseless entity or
conception as that unnameable ‘energy’ which he has just invented, and
that He is circumscribed by it, as by an enclos<span id="page_LIX">p.
LIX</span> <span id="viii.i.iii.xx-Page_LIX"></span>ing prison of
unreality. He who ‘gazes into the unseen’ cannot see the conclusion to
which his teaching tends. It is this: if this ‘energy’ of God has no
real existence, and if the work that this unreality produces is also
circumscribed by it, it is quite clear that we can only think of such a
nature in the work, as that which is possessed by this fancied producer
of the work: in fact, that which is produced from and is contained by an
unreality can itself be conceived of as nothing else but a non-entity.
Opposites, in the nature of things, cannot be contained by opposites:
such as water by fire, life by death, light by darkness, being by
non-being. But with all his excessive cleverness he does not see this:
or else he consciously shuts his eyes to the truth.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xx-p5"></span>Some necessity compels him to see a
diminution in the Son, and to establish a further advance in this
direction in the case of the Holy Ghost. “It necessarily follows,” he
says, “that these energies which accompany these Beings are relatively
greater and less.” This compelling necessity in the Divine nature, which
assigns a greater and a less, has not been explained to us by Eunomius,
nor as yet can we ourselves understand it. Hitherto there has prevailed
with those who accept the Gospel in its plain simplicity the belief that
there is no necessity above the Godhead to bend the Only-begotten, like
a slave, to inferiority. But he quite overlooks this belief, though it
was worth some consideration; and he dogmatizes that we must conceive of
this inferiority. But this necessity of his does not stop there: it
lands him still further in blasphemy: as our examination in detail has
already shewn. If, that is, the Son was born, not from the Father, but
from some unsubstantial ‘energy,’ He must be thought of as not merely
inferior to the Father, and this doctrine must end in pure Judaism. This
necessity, when followed out, exhibits the product of a non-entity as
not merely insignificant, but as something which it is a perilous
blasphemy even for an accuser to name. For as that which has its birth
from an existence necessarily exists, so that which is evolved from the
non-existent necessarily does the very contrary. When anything is not
self-existent, how can it generate another?

<span id="viii.i.iii.xx-p6"></span>If, then, this energy which ‘follows’
the Deity, and produces the Son, has no existence of its own, no one can
be so blind as not to see the conclusion, and that his aim is to deny
our Saviour’s deity: and if the personality of the Son is thus stolen by
their doctrine from the Faith, with nothing left of it but the name, it
will be a long time before the Holy Ghost, descended as He will be from
a lineage of unrealities, will be believed in again. The energy which
‘follows’ the Deity has no existence of its own: then common sense
requires the product of this to be unreal: then a second unsubstantial
energy follows this product: then it is declared that the Holy Ghost is
formed by this energy: so that their blasphemy is plain enough: it
consists in nothing less than in denying that after the Ingenerate God
there is any real existence: and their doctrine advances into shadowy
and unsubstantial fictions, where there is no foundation of any actual
subsistence. In such monstrous conclusions does their teaching strand
the argument.
