<p class="c49"><a name="ix.ii.ii.xiv-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="ix.ii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></A>Chapter XIII.</span></p>  
<p class="c12"><a name="ix.ii.ii.xiv-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="ix.ii.ii.xiv-p2.1"></A>But</span> seeing that Paradise is the home of living spirits, and will not admit those who are dead in sin, and that we on the other hand are fleshly, subject to death, and sold under sin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1428"></A><A HREF="#fn_1428"><FONT SIZE="1">1430</FONT></A>
, how is it possible that one who is a subject of death&#146;s empire should ever dwell in this land where all is life? What method of release from this jurisdiction can be devised? Here too the Gospel teaching is abundantly sufficient. We hear our Lord saying to Nicodemus, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1429"></A><A HREF="#fn_1429"><FONT SIZE="1">1431</FONT></A>
.&#8221; We know too that the flesh is subject to death because of sin, but the Spirit of God is both incorruptible, and life-giving, and deathless. As at our physical birth there comes into the world with us a potentiality of being again turned to dust, plainly the Spirit also imparts a life-giving potentiality to the children begotten by Himself. What lesson, then, results from these remarks? This: that we should wean ourselves from this life in the flesh, which has an inevitable follower, death; and that we should search for a manner of life which does not bring death in its train. Now the life of Virginity is such a life. We will add a few other things to show how true this is. Every one knows that the propagation of mortal frames is the work which the intercourse of the sexes has to do; whereas for those who are joined to the Spirit, life and immortality instead of children are produced by this latter intercourse; and the words of the Apostle beautifully suit their case, for the joyful mother of such children as these &#8220;shall be saved in child-bearing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1430"></A><A HREF="#fn_1430"><FONT SIZE="1">1432</FONT></A>
;&#8221; as the Psalmist in his divine songs thankfully cries, &#8220;He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1431"></A><A HREF="#fn_1431"><FONT SIZE="1">1433</FONT></A>
.&#8221; Truly a joyful mother is the virgin mother who by the operation of the Spirit conceives the deathless children, and who is called by the Prophet barren because of her modesty only. This life, then, which is stronger than the power of death, is, to those who think, the preferable one. The physical bringing of children into the world&#8212;I speak without wishing to offend&#8212;is as much a starting-point of death as of life; because from the moment of birth the process of dying commences. But those who by virginity have desisted from this process have drawn within themselves the boundary line of death, and by their own deed have checked his advance; they have made themselves, in fact, a frontier between life and death, and a barrier too, which thwarts him. If, then, death cannot pass beyond virginity, but finds his power checked and shattered there, it is demonstrated that virginity is a stronger thing than death; and that body is rightly named undying which does not lend its service to a dying world, nor brook to become the instrument of a succession of dying creatures. In such a body the long unbroken career of decay and death, which has intervened between&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1432"></A><A HREF="#fn_1432"><FONT SIZE="1">1434</FONT></A>
 the first man and the lives of virginity which have been led, is interrupted. It could not be indeed that death should cease working as long as the human race by marriage was working too; he walked the path of life with all preceding generations; he started with every new-born child and accompanied it to the end: but he found in virginity a barrier, to pass which was an impossible feat. Just as, in the age of Mary the mother of God, he who had reigned from Adam to her time found, when he came to her and dashed his forces against the fruit of her virginity as against a <A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.ii.xiv-Page_360"></A>rock, that he was shattered to pieces upon her, so in every soul which passes through this life in the flesh under the protection of virginity, the strength of death is in a manner broken and annulled, for he does not find the places upon which he may fix his sting. If you do not throw into the fire wood, or straw, or grass, or something that it can consume, it has not the force to last by itself; so the power of death cannot go on working, if marriage does not supply it with material and prepare victims for this executioner. If you have any doubts left, consider the actual names of those afflictions which death brings upon mankind, and which were detailed in the first part of this discourse. Whence do they get their meaning? &#8220;Widowhood,&#8221; &#8220;orphanhood,&#8221; &#8220;loss of children,&#8221; could they be a subject for grief, if marriage did not precede? Nay, all the dearly-prized blisses, and transports, and comforts of marriage end in these agonies of grief. The hilt of a sword is smooth and handy, and polished and glittering outside; it seems to grow to the outline of the hand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1433"></A><A HREF="#fn_1433"><FONT SIZE="1">1435</FONT></A>
; but the other part is steel and the instrument of death, formidable to look at, more formidable still to come across. Such a thing is marriage. It offers for the grasp of the senses a smooth surface of delights, like a hilt of rare polish and beautiful workmanship; but when a man has taken it up and has got it into his hands, he finds the pain that has been wedded to it is in his hands as well; and it becomes to him the worker of mourning and of loss. It is marriage that has the heartrending spectacles to show of children left desolate in the tenderness of their years, a mere prey to the powerful, yet smiling often at their misfortune from ignorance of coming woes. What is the cause of widowhood but marriage? And retirement from this would bring with it an immunity from the whole burden of these sad taxes on our hearts. Can we expect it otherwise? When the verdict that was pronounced on the delinquents in the beginning is annulled, then too the mothers&#146; &#8220;sorrows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1434"></A><A HREF="#fn_1434"><FONT SIZE="1">1436</FONT></A>
&#8221; are no longer &#8220;multiplied,&#8221; nor does &#8220;sorrow&#8221; herald the births of men; then all calamity has been removed from life and &#8220;tears wiped from off all faces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1435"></A><A HREF="#fn_1435"><FONT SIZE="1">1437</FONT></A>
;&#8221; conception is no more an iniquity, nor child-bearing a sin; and births shall be no more &#8220;of bloods,&#8221; or &#8220;of the will of man,&#8221; or &#8220;of the will of the flesh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1436"></A><A HREF="#fn_1436"><FONT SIZE="1">1438</FONT></A>
&#8221;, but of God alone. This is always happening whenever any one in a lively heart conceives all the integrity of the Spirit, and brings forth wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption too. It is possible for any one to be the mother of such a son; as our Lord says, &#8220;He that doeth my will is my brother, my sister, and my mother&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1437"></A><A HREF="#fn_1437"><FONT SIZE="1">1439</FONT></A>
.&#8221; What room is there for death in such parturitions? Indeed in them death is swallowed up by life. In fact, the Life of Virginity seems to be an actual representation of the blessedness in the world to come, showing as it does in itself so many signs of the presence of those expected blessings which are reserved for us there. That the truth of this statement may be perceived, we will verify it thus. It is so, first, because a man who has thus died once for all to sin lives for the future to God; he brings forth no more fruit unto death; and having so far as in him lies made an end&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1438"></A><A HREF="#fn_1438"><FONT SIZE="1">1440</FONT></A>
 of this life within him according to the flesh, he awaits thenceforth the expected blessing of the manifestation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1439"></A><A HREF="#fn_1439"><FONT SIZE="1">1441</FONT></A>
 of the great God, refraining from putting any distance between himself and this coming of God by an intervening posterity: secondly, because he enjoys even in this present life a certain exquisite glory of all the blessed results of our resurrection. For our Lord has announced that the life after our resurrection shall be as that of the angels. Now the peculiarity of the angelic nature is that they are strangers to marriage; therefore the blessing of this promise has been already received by him who has not only mingled his own glory with the halo of the Saints, but also by the stainlessness of his life has so imitated the purity of these incorporeal beings. If virginity then can win us favours such as these, what words are fit to express the admiration of so great a grace? What other gift of the soul can be found so great and precious as not to suffer by comparison with this perfection?</p>
