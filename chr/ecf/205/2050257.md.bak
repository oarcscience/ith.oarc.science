<span id="xi.ii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xxxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p2.1"></span>But</span> since the human being is a
twofold creature, compounded of soul and body, it is necessary that the
saved should lay hold of <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2036](#fn_2034.md) the
Author of the new life through both their component parts. Accordingly,
the soul being fused into Him through faith derives from that the means
and occasion of salvation; for the act of union with the life implies a
fellowship with the life. But the body comes into fellowship and
blending with the Author of our salvation in another way. For as they
who owing to some act of treachery have taken poison, allay its deadly
influence by means of some other drug (for it is necessary that the
antidote should enter the human vitals in the same way as the deadly
poison, in order to secure, through them, that the effect of the remedy
may be distributed through the entire system), in like manner we, who
have tasted the solvent of our nature <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2037](#fn_2035.md) , necessarily need something that
may combine what has been so dissolved, so that such an antidote
entering within us may, by its own counter-influence, undo the mischief
introduced into the body by the poison. What, then, is this remedy to
be? Nothing else than that very Body which has been shown to be superior
to death, and has been the First-fruits of our life. For, in the manner
that, as the Apostle says <span id="fr_2036"></span>[2038](#fn_2036.md) , a
little leaven assimilates to itself the whole lump, so in like manner
that body to which immortality has been given it by God, when it is in
ours, <span id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-Page_505"></span>translates and transmutes the whole
into itself. For as by the admixture of a poisonous liquid with a
wholesome one the whole drought is deprived of its deadly effect, so too
the immortal Body, by being within that which receives it, changes the
whole to its own nature. Yet in no other way can anything enter within
the body but by being transfused through the vitals by eating and
drinking. It is, therefore, incumbent on the body to admit this
life-producing power in the one way that its constitution makes
possible. And since that Body only which was the receptacle of the Deity
received this grace of immortality, and since it has been shown that in
no other way was it possible for our body to become immortal, but by
participating in incorruption through its fellowship with that immortal
Body, it will be necessary to consider how it was possible that that one
Body, being for ever portioned to so many myriads of the faithful
throughout the whole world, enters through that portion, whole into each
individual, and yet remains whole in itself. In order, therefore, that
our faith, with eyes fixed on logical probability, may harbour no doubt
on the subject before us, it is fitting to make a slight digression in
our argument, to consider the physiology of the body. Who is there that
does not know that our bodily frame, taken by itself, possesses no life
in its own proper subsistence, but that it is by the influx of a force
or power from without that it holds itself together and continues in
existence, and by a ceaseless motion that it draws to itself what it
wants, and repels what is superfluous? When a leathern bottle is full of
some liquid, and then the contents leak out at the bottom, it would not
retain the contour of its full bulk unless there entered in at the top
something else to fill up the vacuum; and thus a person, seeing the
circumference of this bottle swollen to its full size, would know that
this circumference did not really belong to the object which he sees,
but that what was being poured in, by being in it, gave shape and
roundness to the bulk. In the same way the mere framework of our body
possesses nothing belonging to itself that is cognizable by us, to hold
it together, but remains in existence owing to a force that is
introduced into it. Now this power or force both is, and is called,
nourishment. But it is not the same in all bodies that require aliment,
but to each of them has been assigned a food adapted to its condition by
Him who governs Nature. Some animals feed on roots which they dig up. Of
others grass is the food, of others different kinds of flesh, but for
man above all things bread; and, in order to continue and preserve the
moisture of his body, drink, not simply water, but water frequently
sweetened with wine, to join forces with our internal heat. He,
therefore, who thinks of these things, thinks by implication <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2039](#fn_2037.md) of the particular bulk of our body.
For those things by being within me became my blood and flesh, the
corresponding nutriment by its power of adaptation being changed into
the form of my body. With these distinctions we must return to the
consideration of the question before us. The question was, how can that
one Body of Christ vivify the whole of mankind, all, that is, in
whomsoever there is Faith, and yet, though divided amongst all, be
itself not diminished? Perhaps, then, we are now not far from the
probable explanation. If the subsistence of every body depends on
nourishment, and this is eating and drinking, and in the case of our
eating there is bread and in the case of our drinking water sweetened
with wine, and if, as was explained at the beginning, the Word of God,
Who is both God and the Word, coalesced with man’s nature, and when He
came in a body such as ours did not innovate on man’s physical
constitution so as to make it other than it was, but secured continuance
for His own body by the customary and proper means, and controlled its
subsistence by meat and drink, the former of which was bread,—just,
then, as in the case of ourselves, as has been repeatedly said already,
if a person sees bread he also, in a kind of way, looks on a human body,
for by the bread being within it the bread becomes it, so also, in that
other case, the body into which God entered, by partaking of the
nourishment of bread, was, in a certain measure, the same with it; that
nourishment, as we have said, changing itself into the nature of the
body. For that which is peculiar to all flesh is acknowledged also in
the case of that flesh, namely, that that Body too was maintained by
bread; which Body also by the indwelling of God the Word was transmuted
to the dignity of Godhead. Rightly, then, do we believe that now also
the bread which is consecrated by the Word of God is changed into the
Body of God the Word. For that Body was once, by implication, bread, but
has been consecrated by the inhabitation of the Word that tabernacled in
the flesh. Therefore, from the same cause as that by which the bread
that was transformed in that Body was changed to a Divine potency, a
similar result takes place now. For as in that case, too, the grace of
the Word used to make holy the Body, the substance of which came of the
bread, and in a manner was itself bread, so also in this case the bread,
as says the Apostle <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2040](#fn_2038.md) , “is
sanctified by the Word of God and prayer”; not that it advances by the
process of eating <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2041](#fn_2039.md) <span
id="page_506">p. 506</span> <span id="xi.ii.xxxix-Page_506"></span>to
the stage of passing into the body of the Word, but it is at once
changed into the body by means of the Word, as the Word itself said,
“This is My Body.” Seeing, too, that all flesh is nourished by what is
moist (for without this combination our earthly part would not continue
to live), just as we support by food which is firm and solid the solid
part of our body, in like manner we supplement the moist part from the
kindred element; and this, when within us, by its faculty of being
transmitted, is changed to blood, and especially if through the wine it
receives the faculty of being transmuted into heat. Since, then, that
God-containing flesh partook for its substance and support of this
particular nourishment also, and since the God who was manifested
infused Himself into perishable humanity for this purpose, viz. that by
this communion with Deity mankind might at the same time be deified, for
this end it is that, by dispensation of His grace, He disseminates
Himself in every believer through that flesh, whose substance comes from
bread and wine, blending Himself with the bodies of believers, to secure
that, by this union with the immortal, man, too, may be a sharer in
incorruption. He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through
which He transelements <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2042](#fn_2040.md) the
natural quality of these visible things to that immortal thing.

<span id="xi.ii.xxxix-p4"></span> Gregory seems here to refer to Eve’s
eating the apple, which introduced a moral and *physical* poison into
our nature. General Gordon’s thoughts (“in Palestine”) took the same
direction as the whole of this passage; which Fronto Ducæus (as quoted
by Krabinger) would even regard as a proof of transubstantiation.

<span id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8"></span> *by the process of eating,* <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.1"></span>διὰ βρώσεως</span>.
There is very little authority for <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.2"></span>καὶ πόσεως</span> which follows in some
Codd. If Krabinger’s text is here correct, Gregory distinctly teaches a
transmutation of the elements very like the later transubstantiation: he
also distinctly teaches that the words of consecration effect the
change. There seems no reason to doubt that the text is correct. The
three Latin interpretations, “a verbo transmutatus,” “statim a verbo
transmutatus,” “per verbum mutatus,” of Hervetus, Morell, and Zinus, all
point to their having found <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.3"></span>πρὸς τὸ σῶμα διὰ τοῦ λόγου
μεταποιούμενος</span> in the text: and this is the reading of Cod. Reg.
(the other reading is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.4"></span>πρὸς τὸ σῶμα τοῦ λόγου</span>). A passage
from Justin Mart., *Apol.* ii. p. 77, also supports Krabinger’s text.
Justin says, “so we are taught that that food which has been blessed by
the pronouncing of the word that came from Him, which food by changing
nourishes our blood and flesh, is the flesh and blood of that Incarnate
Jesus.” As to the nature of the change (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.5"></span>πρὸς τὸ σῶμα μεταποιούμενος</span>),
another passage in Gregory (*In Baptism. Christi,* 370 A) should be
compared: “The bread again, was for a while common bread, but when the
mystic word shall have consecrated it (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.6"></span>ἱ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.7"></span>ερουργήσῃ</span>), it is called, *and
moreover is,* the body of Christ.” He says also at the end of this
chapter, “He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through
which He *transelements* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.8"></span>μεταστοιχειώσας</span>) the natural quality
(<span class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.9"></span>φύσιν</span>) of
these visible things to that immortal thing.” Harnack does not attempt
to weaken the force of these and other passages, but only points out
that the idea of this change does not exactly correspond (how could it?)
with the mediæval scholastically-philosophical “transubstantiation.”
Gregory’s belief is that, just as the Word, when Christ was here in the
flesh, rendered holy His body that assimilated bread, which still *in a
manner remained bread,* so now the bread is sanctified by the Word of
God and by prayer. “The idea,” says Neander, “of the repetition of the
consecration of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.10"></span>Λόγος</span> had taken hold of his mind.”
The construction is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.11"></span>προϊ& 241·ν (ὥστε) γενέσθαι εἰς τὸ σῶμα
τοῦ λόγου</span>, “eo progrediens, ut verbi corpus evadat.”

<span id="fn_2040"></span>[506:2042](2050257.htm#fr_2040.md) <span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p8.12"></span>

<span id="xi.ii.xxxix-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p9.1"></span>μεταστοιχειώσας</span>. Suicer labours,
without success, to show that the word is not equivalent to
*transelementare* or <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p9.2"></span>μετουσιοῦν</span>, but only to *substantiam
convertere,* i.e. to change by an addition of grace into another *mode*
or *use.* In the passages from Epiphanius which Suicer adduces for
“figure,” “mode,” as a meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p9.3"></span>στοιχεῖον</span> itself, that word means a
sign of the zodiac (as in our Gregory’s *De Animâ et Resurr.,* it means
the moon), only because the heavenly bodies are the *elements or first
principles* as it were of the celestial alphabet. The other meaning of
<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p9.4"></span>μεταστοιχειοῦν</span> which he gives,
*i.e.* to unteach, with a view to obscure the literal meaning here, is
quite inapplicable. Gregory defines more clearly than Chrysostom (<span
class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p9.5"></span>μεταρρυθμίζεσθαι</span>), Theophylact
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p9.6"></span>μεταποιεῖσθαι</span>), and John Damascene
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxix-p9.7"></span>μεταβάλλεσθαι</span>), the change that
takes place: but all go beyond Theodoret’s (*Dial.* ii), “not changing
nature, but adding grace to the nature,” which Suicer endeavours to read
into this word of Gregory’s. It is to be noticed, too, that in Philo the
word is used of Xerxes changing in his march one element into another,
i.e. *earth into water,* not the mere use of the one into the use of the
other.
