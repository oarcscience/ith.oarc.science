<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—<span class="c22"><span
id="vii.iv-p1.2"></span>His Teaching on the Holy Trinity</span>.</span>

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.iv-p2.1"></span>To</span> estimate the exact value of the work
done by S. Gregory in the establishment of the doctrine of the Trinity
and in the determination, so far as Eastern Christendom is concerned, of
the terminology employed for the expression of that doctrine, is a task
which can hardly be satisfactorily carried out. His teaching on the
subject is so closely bound up with that of his brother, S. Basil of
Cæsarea,—his “master,” to use his own phrase,—that the two can hardly be
separated with any certainty. Where a disciple, carrying on the teaching
he has himself received from another, with perhaps almost imperceptible
variations of expression, has extended the influence of that teaching
and strengthened its hold on the minds of men, it must always be a
matter of some difficulty to discriminate accurately between the
services which the two have rendered to their common cause, and to say
how far the result attained is due to the earlier, how far to the later
presentment of the doctrine. But the task of so discriminating between
the work of S. Basil and that of S. Gregory is rendered yet more
complicated by the uncertainty attaching to the authorship of particular
treatises which have been claimed for both. If, for instance, we could
with certainty assign to S. Gregory that treatise on the terms <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p2.2"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p2.3"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p2.4"></span>πόστασις</span>, which
Dorner treats as one of the works by which he “contributed materially to
fix the uncertain usage of the Church <span
id="fr_37"></span>[39](#fn_37.md) ,” but which is found also among the
works of S. Basil in the form of a letter addressed to S. Gregory
himself, we should be able to estimate the nature and the extent of the
influence of the Bishop of Nyssa much more definitely than we can
possibly do while the authorship of this treatise remains uncertain. Nor
does this document stand alone in this respect, although it is perhaps
of more importance for the determination of such a question than any
other of the disputed treatises. Thus in the absence of certainty as to
the precise extent to which S. Gregory’s teaching was directly indebted
to that of his brother, it seems impossible to say how far the “fixing
of the uncertain usage of the Church” was due to either of them singly.
That together they did contribute very largely to <span
id="page_XXIV">p. XXIV</span> <span id="vii.iv-Page_XXIV"></span>that
result is beyond question: and it is perhaps superfluous to endeavour to
separate their contributions, especially as there can be little doubt
that S. Gregory at least conceived himself to be in agreement with S.
Basil upon all important points, if not to be acting simply as the
mouth-piece of his “master’s” teaching, and as the defender of the
statements which his “master” had set forth against possible
misconceptions of their meaning. Some points, indeed, there clearly
were, in which S. Gregory’s presentment of the doctrine differs from
that of S. Basil; but to these it may be better to revert at a later
stage, after considering the more striking variation which their
teaching displays from the language of the earlier Nicene school as
represented by S. Athanasius.

<span id="vii.iv-p4"></span>The council held at Alexandria in the year
362, during the brief restoration of S. Athanasius, shows us at once the
point of contrast and the substantial agreement between the Western
school, with which S. Athanasius himself is in this matter to be
reckoned, and the Eastern theologians to whom has been given the title
of “Neo-Nicene.” The question at issue was one of language, not of
belief; it turned upon the sense to be attached to the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p4.1"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p4.2"></span>πόστασις</span>. The
Easterns, following a use of the term which may be traced perhaps to the
influence of Origen, employed the word in the sense of the Latin
“Persona,” and spoke of the Three Persons as <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p4.3"></span>τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις</span>, whereas the Latins
employed the term “*hypostasis*” as equivalent to “*sub-stantia*,” to
express what the Greeks called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p4.4"></span>οὐσία</span>,—the one Godhead of the Three
Persons. With the Latins agreed the older school of the orthodox Greek
theologians, who applied to the Three Persons the phrase <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p4.5"></span>τρία πρόσωπα</span>,
speaking of the Godhead as <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p4.6"></span>μία ὑπόστασις</span>. This phrase, in the eyes
of the newer Nicene school, was suspected of Sabellianism <span
id="fr_38"></span>[40](#fn_38.md) , while on the other hand the Westerns
were inclined to regard the Eastern phrase <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p5.6"></span>τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις</span> as implying tritheism.
The synodal letter sets forth to us the means by which the fact of
substantial agreement between the two schools was brought to light, and
the understanding arrived at, that while Arianism on the one hand and
Sabellianism on the other were to be condemned, it was advisable to be
content with the language of the Nicene formula, which employed neither
the phrase <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p5.7"></span>μία
ὑπόστασις</span> nor the phrase <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p5.8"></span>τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις</span> <span
id="fr_39"></span>[41](#fn_39.md) . This resolution, prudent as it may have
been for the purpose of bringing together those who were in real
agreement, and of securing that the reconciled parties should, at a
critical moment, present an unbroken front in the face of their common
and still dangerous enemy, could hardly be long maintained. The
expression <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p6.1"></span>τρεῖς
ὑποστάσεις</span> was one to which many of the orthodox, including those
who had formerly belonged to the Semi-Arian section, had become
accustomed: the Alexandrine synod, under the guidance of S. Athanasius,
had acknowledged the phrase, as used by them, to be an orthodox one, and
S. Basil, in his efforts to conciliate the Semi-Arian party, with which
he had himself been closely connected through his namesake of Ancyra and
through Eustathius of Sebastia, saw fit definitely to adopt it. While S.
Athanasius, on the one hand, using the older terminology, says that
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p6.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p6.3"></span>πόστασις</span> is
equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p6.4"></span>οὐσία</span>, and has no other meaning <span
id="fr_40"></span>[42](#fn_40.md) , S. Basil, on the other hand, goes so
far as to say that the terms <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p7.3"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p7.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p7.5"></span>πόστασις</span>, even in the Nicene anathema,
are not to be understood as equivalent <span
id="fr_41"></span>[43](#fn_41.md) . The adoption of the new phrase, even
after the explanations given at Alexandria, was found to require, in
order to avoid misconstruction, a more precise definition of its
meaning, and a formal defence of its orthodoxy. And herein consisted one
principal service rendered by S. Basil and S. Gregory; while with more
precise definition of the term <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p8.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p8.3"></span>πόστασις</span> there emerged, it may be, a more
precise view of the relations of the Persons, and with the defence of
the new phrase as expressive of the Trinity of Persons a more precise
view of what is implied in the Unity of the Godhead.

<span id="vii.iv-p9"></span><span id="page_XXV">p. XXV</span> <span
id="vii.iv-Page_XXV"></span>The treatise, *De Sancta Trinitate* is one
of those which are attributed by some to S. Basil, by others to S.
Gregory: but for the purpose of showing the difficulties with which they
had to deal, the question of its exact authorship is unimportant.  <span
id="fr_42"></span>[44](#fn_42.md) The most obvious objection alleged
against their teaching was that which had troubled the Western
theologians before the Alexandrine Council,—the objection that the
acknowledgment of Three Persons implied a belief in Three Gods. To meet
this, there was required a statement of the meaning of the term <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p10.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p10.3"></span>πόστασις</span>, and of the
relation of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p10.4"></span>ὀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p10.5"></span>υσία</span> to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p10.6"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p10.7"></span>πόστασις</span>. Another objection, urged
apparently by the same party as the former, was directed against the
“novelty,” or inconsistency, of employing in the singular terms
expressive of the Divine Nature such as “goodness” or “Godhead,” while
asserting that the Godhead exists in plurality of Persons <span
id="fr_43"></span>[45](#fn_43.md) . To meet this, it was required that the
sense in which the Unity of the Godhead was maintained should be more
plainly and clearly defined.

<span id="vii.iv-p12"></span>The position taken by S. Basil with regard
to the terms <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p12.1"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p12.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p12.3"></span>πόστασις</span> is very concisely stated in his
letter to Terentius <span id="fr_44"></span>[46](#fn_44.md) . He says that
the Western theologians themselves acknowledge that a distinction does
exist between the two terms: and he briefly sets forth his view of the
nature of that distinction by saying that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p13.2"></span>οὐσία</span> is to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p13.3"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p13.4"></span>πόστασις</span> as that which is common to
individuals is to that in respect of which the individuals are naturally
differentiated. He illustrates this statement by the remark that each
individual man has his being <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p13.5"></span>τῷ κοίνῳ τῆς οὐσίας λόγῳ</span>, while he is
differentiated as an individual man in virtue of his own particular
attributes. So in the Trinity that which constitutes the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p13.6"></span>οὐσία</span> (be it
“goodness” or be it “Godhead”) is common, while the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p13.7"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p13.8"></span>πόστασις</span> is marked
by the Personal attribute of Fatherhood or Sonship or Sanctifying
Power <span id="fr_45"></span>[47](#fn_45.md) . This position is also
adopted and set forth in greater detail in the treatise, *De Diff.
Essen. et Hypost.* <span id="fr_46"></span>[48](#fn_46.md) , already
referred to, where we find once more the illustration employed in the
Epistle to Terentius. The Nature of the Father is beyond our
comprehension; but whatever conception we are able to form of that
Nature, we must consider it to be common also to the Son and to the Holy
Spirit: so far as the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p15.2"></span>οὐσία</span> is concerned, whatever is
predicated of any one of the Persons may be predicated equally of each
of the Three Persons, just as the properties of man, *quâ* man, belong
alike to Paul and Barnabas and Timothy: and as these individual men are
differentiated by their own particular attributes, so each Person of the
Trinity is distinguished by a certain attribute from the other two
Persons. This way of putting the case naturally leads to the question,
“If you say, as you do say, that Paul and Barnabas and Timothy are
‘three men,’ why do you not say that the Three Persons are ‘three
Gods?’” Whether the question was presented in this shape to S. Basil we
cannot with certainty decide: but we may gather from his language
regarding the applicability of number to the Trinity what his answer
would have been. He <span id="fr_47"></span>[49](#fn_47.md) says that in
acknowledging One Father, One Son, One Holy Spirit, we do not enumerate
them by computation, but assert the individuality, so to say, of each
hypostasis—its distinctness from the others. He would probably have
replied by saying that strictly speaking we ought to decline applying to
the Deity, considered as Deity, any numerical idea at all, and that to
enumerate the Persons as “three” is a necessity, possibly, imposed upon
us by language, but that no conception of number is really applicable to
the Divine Nature or to the Divine Persons, <span id="page_XXVI">p.
XXVI</span> <span id="vii.iv-Page_XXVI"></span>which transcend
number <span id="fr_48"></span>[50](#fn_48.md) . To S. Gregory, however,
the question did actually present itself as one demanding an answer, and
his reply to it marks his departure from S. Basil’s position, though, if
the treatise, *De Diff. Essen. et Hyp.* be S. Basil’s, S. Gregory was
but following out and defending the view of his “master” as expressed in
that treatise.

<span id="vii.iv-p18"></span>S. Gregory’s reply to the difficulty may be
found in the letter, or short dissertation, addressed to Ablabius (*Quod
non sunt tres Dei*), and in his treatise <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p18.1"></span>περὶ κοινῶν ἐννοίων</span>. In the latter he
lays it down that the term <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p18.2"></span>θεός</span> is a term <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p18.3"></span>οὐσίας σημαντικόν</span>, not a term <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p18.4"></span>προσώπων δηλωτικόν</span>:
the Godhead of the Father is not that in which He maintains His
differentiation from the Son: the Son is not God because He is *Son,*
but because His essential Nature is what it is. Accordingly, when we
speak of “God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost,” the word
*and* is employed to conjoin the terms expressive of the Persons, not
the repeated term which is expressive of the Essence, and which
therefore, while applied to each of the Three Persons, yet cannot
properly be employed in the plural. That in the case of three individual
“*men*” the term expressive of essence *is* employed in the plural is
due, he says, to the fact that in this case there are circumstances
which excuse or constrain such a use of the term “man” while such
circumstances do not affect the case of the Holy Trinity. The
individuals included under the term “man” vary alike in number and in
identity, and thus we are constrained to speak of “men” as more or
fewer, and in a certain sense to treat the essence as well as the
persons numerically. In the Holy Trinity, on the other hand, the Persons
are always the same, and their number the same. Nor are the Persons of
the Holy Trinity differentiated, like individual men, by relations of
time and place, and the like; the differentiation between them is based
upon a constant causal relation existing among the Three Persons, which
does not affect the unity of the Nature: it does not express the Being,
but the *mode* of Being <span id="fr_49"></span>[51](#fn_49.md) . The
Father is the Cause; the Son and the Holy Spirit are differentiated from
Him as being from the Cause, and again differentiated *inter se* as
being immediately from the Cause, and immediately through that which is
from the Cause. Further, while these reasons may be alleged for holding
that the cases are not in such a sense parallel as to allow that the
same conclusion as to modes of speech should be drawn in both, he urges
that the use of the term “men” in the plural is, strictly speaking,
erroneous. We should, in strictness, speak not of “this or that man,”
but of “this or that hypostasis of man”—the “three men” should be
described as “three hypostases” of the common <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p19.5"></span>οὐσία</span> “man.” In the treatise addressed
to Ablabius he goes over the same ground, clothing his arguments in a
somewhat less philosophical dress; but he devotes more space to an
examination of the meaning of the term <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p19.6"></span>θεός</span>, with a view to showing that it is
a term expressive of operation, and thereby of *essence,* not a term
which may be considered as applicable to any one of the Divine Persons
in any such peculiar sense that it may not equally be applied also to
the other two <span id="fr_50"></span>[52](#fn_50.md) . His argument is
partly based upon an etymology now discredited, but this does not affect
the position he seeks to establish (a position which is also adopted in
the treatise, *De S. Trinitate*), that names expressive of the Divine
Nature, or of the Divine operation (by which alone that Nature is known
to us) are employed, and ought to be employed, only in the singular. The
unity and inseparability of all Divine operation, proceeding from the
Father, advancing through the Son, and culminating in the Holy Spirit,
yet setting forth one <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p20.1"></span>κίνησις</span> of the Divine will, is the
reason why the idea of plurality is not suffered to attach to these
names <span id="fr_51"></span>[53](#fn_51.md) , <span id="page_XXVII">p.
XXVII</span> <span id="vii.iv-Page_XXVII"></span>while the reason for
refusing to allow, in regard to the three Divine Persons, the same
laxity of language which we tolerate in regard to the case of the three
“men,” is to be found in the fact that in the latter case no danger
arises from the current abuse of language: no one thinks of “three human
natures;” but on the other hand polytheism is a very real and serious
danger, to which the parallel abuse of language involved in speaking of
“three Gods” would infallibly expose us.

<span id="vii.iv-p22"></span>S. Gregory’s own doctrine, indeed, has
seemed to some critics to be open to the charge of tritheism. But even
if his doctrine were entirely expressed in the single illustration of
which we have spoken, it does not seem that the charge would hold good,
when we consider the light in which the illustration would present
itself to him. The conception of the unity of human nature is with him a
thing intensely vivid: it underlies much of his system, and he brings it
prominently forward more than once in his more philosophical
writings <span id="fr_52"></span>[54](#fn_52.md) . We cannot, in fairness,
leave his realism out of account when we are estimating the force of his
illustration: and therefore, while admitting that the illustration was
one not unlikely to produce misconceptions of his teaching, we may
fairly acquit him of any personal bias towards tritheism such as might
appear to be involved in the unqualified adoption of the same
illustration by a writer of our own time, or such as might have been
attributed to theologians of the period of S. Gregory who adopted the
illustration without the qualification of a realism as determined as his
own <span id="fr_53"></span>[55](#fn_53.md) . But the illustration does not
stand alone: we must not consider that it is the only one of those to be
found in the treatise, *De Diff. Essen. et Hypost.,* which he would have
felt justified in employing. Even if the illustration of the rainbow,
set forth in that treatise, was not actually his own (as Dorner,
ascribing the treatise to him, considers it to have been), it was at all
events (on the other theory of the authorship), included in the teaching
he had received from his “master:” it would be present to his mind,
although in his undisputed writings, where he is dealing with objections
brought against the particular illustration from human relations, he
naturally confines himself to the particular illustration from which an
erroneous inference was being drawn. In our estimate of his teaching the
one illustration must be allowed to some extent to qualify the effect
produced by the other. And, further, we must remember that his argument
from human relations is professedly *only* an illustration. It points to
an *analogy,* to a resemblance, not to an identity of relations; so much
he is careful in his reply to state. Even if it were true, he implies,
that we are warranted in speaking, in the given case, of the three human
persons as “three men,” it would not follow that we should be warranted
thereby in speaking of the three Divine Persons as “three Gods.” For the
human personalities stand contrasted with the Divine, at once as regards
their being and as regards their operation. The various human <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.1"></span>πρόσωπα</span> draw their
being from many other <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p24.2"></span>πρόσωπα</span>, one from one, another from
another, not, as the Divine, from One, unchangeably the same: they
operate, each in his own way, severally and independently, not, as the
Divine, inseparably: they are contemplated each by himself, in his own
limited sphere, <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.3"></span>κατ᾽
ἰδίαν περιγραφήν</span>, not, as the Divine, in mutual essential
connexion, differentiated one from the other only by a certain mutual
relation. And from this it follows that the human <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.4"></span>πρόσωπα</span> are capable
of enumeration in a sense in which number cannot be considered
applicable to the Divine Persons. Here we find S. Gregory’s teaching
brought once more into harmony with his “master’s:” if he has been
willing to carry the use of numerical terms rather further than S. Basil
was prepared to do, he yet is content in the last resort to say that
number is not in strictness applicable to the Divine <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.5"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.6"></span>ποστάσεις</span>, in that
they cannot be contemplated <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p24.7"></span>κατ᾽ ἰδίαν περιγραφήν</span>, and therefore
cannot be enumerated by way of addition. Still the distraction of the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.8"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.9"></span>ποστάσεις</span> remains;
and if there is no other way (as he seems to have considered there was
<span id="page_XXVIII">p. XXVIII</span> <span
id="vii.iv-Page_XXVIII"></span>none), of making full acknowledgment of
their distinct though inseparable existence than to speak of them as
“three,” he holds that that use of numerical language is justifiable, so
long as we do not transfer the idea of number from the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.10"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.11"></span>ποστάσεις</span> to the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p24.12"></span>οὐσία</span>, to
that Nature of God which is Itself beyond our conception, and which we
can only express by terms suggested to us by what we know of Its
operation.

<span id="vii.iv-p25"></span>Such, in brief, is the teaching of S.
Gregory on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, as expressed in the
treatises in which he developed and defended those positions in which S.
Basil appeared to diverge from the older Nicene theologians. That the
terminology of the subject gained clearness and definiteness from his
exposition, in that he rendered it plain that the adoption of the
Eastern phraseology was a thing perfectly consistent with the Faith
confessed alike by East and West in varying terms, seems beyond doubt.
It was to him, probably, rather than to S. Basil, that this work was
due; for he cleared up the points which S. Basil’s illustration had left
doubtful; yet in so doing he was using throughout the weapons which his
“master” had placed in his hands, and arguing in favour of his
“master’s” statements, in language, it may be, less guarded than S.
Basil himself would have employed, but in accordance throughout with the
principles which S. Basil had followed. Each bore his own part in the
common work: to one, perhaps, is due the credit of greater originality;
to the other it was given to carry on and to extend what his brother had
begun: neither, we may well believe, would have desired to claim that
the work which their joint teaching effected should be imputed to
himself alone.

<span id="vii.iv-p26"></span>So far, we have especially had in view
those minor treatises of S. Gregory which illustrate such variations
from Athanasian modes of expression as are to be found in the writers of
the “Neo-Nicene” school. These are perhaps his most characteristic works
upon the subject. But the doctrine of the Trinity, as he held it, is
further set forth and enforced in other treatises which are, from
another point of view, much more important than those with which we have
been dealing—in his *Oratio Catechetica,* and his more directly
polemical treatises against Eunomius. In both these sections of his
writings, when allowance is made for the difference of terminology
already discussed, we are less struck by the divergencies from S.
Athanasius’ presentment of the doctrine than by the substantial identity
of S. Gregory’s reasoning with that of S. Athanasius, as the latter is
displayed, for example, in the “Orations against the Arians.”

<span id="vii.iv-p27"></span>There are, of course, many points in which
S. Gregory falls short of his great predecessor; but of these some may
perhaps be accounted for by the different aspect of the Arian
controversy as it presented itself to the two champions of the Faith.
The later school of Arianism may indeed be regarded as a perfectly
legitimate and rigidly logical development of the doctrines taught by
Arius himself; but in some ways the task of S. Gregory was a different
task from that of S. Athanasius, and was the less formidable of the two.
His antagonist was, by his own greater definiteness of statement, placed
at a disadvantage: the consequences which S. Athanasius had to extract
from the Arian statements were by Eunomius and the Anomœans either
openly asserted or tacitly admitted: and it was thus an easier matter
for S. Gregory to show the real tendency of Anomœan doctrine than it had
been for S. Athanasius to point out the real tendency of the earlier
Arianism. Further, it may be said that by the time of S. Basil, still
more by the time when S. Gregory succeeded to his brother’s place in the
controversy, the victory over Arianism was assured. It was not possible
for S. Athanasius, even had it been in his nature to do so, to treat the
earlier Arianism with the same sort of contemptuous criticism with which
Eunomius is frequently met by S. Gregory. For S. Gregory, on the other
hand, it was not necessary to refrain from such criticism lest he should
thereby detract from the force of his protest against error. The crisis
in his day was not one which demanded the same sustained effort for
which the contest called in the days of S. Athanasius. Now and then,
certainly, S. Gregory also rises <span id="page_XXIX">p. XXIX</span>
<span id="vii.iv-Page_XXIX"></span>to a white heat of indignation
against his adversary: but it is hardly too much to say that his work
appears to lack just those qualities which seem, in the writings of S.
Athanasius, to have been called forth by the author’s sense of the
weight of the force opposed to him, and of the “life and death”
character of the contest. S. Gregory does not under-estimate the
momentous nature of the questions at issue: but when he wrote, he might
feel that to those questions the answer of Christendom had been already
given, that the conflict was already won, and that any attempt at
developing the Arian doctrine on Anomœan lines was the adoption of an
untenable position,—even of a position manifestly and evidently
untenable: the doctrine had but to be stated in clear terms to be
recognized as incompatible with Christianity, and, that fact once
recognized, he had no more to do. Thus much of his treatises against
Eunomius consists not of constructive argument in support of his own
position, but of a detailed examination of Eunomius’ own statements,
while a further portion of the contents of these books, by no means
inconsiderable in amount, is devoted not so much to the defence of the
Faith as to the refutation of certain misrepresentations of S. Basil’s
arguments which had been set forth by Eunomius.

<span id="vii.iv-p28"></span>Even in the more distinctly constructive
portion of these polemical writings, however, it may be said that S.
Gregory does not show marked originality of thought either in his
general argument, or in his mode of handling disputed texts. Within the
limits of an introductory essay like the present, anything like detailed
comparison on these points is of course impossible; but any one who will
take the trouble to compare the discourses of S. Gregory against
Eunomius with the “Orations” of S. Athanasius against the Arians,—the
Athanasian writing, perhaps, most closely corresponding in character to
these books of S. Gregory,—either as regards the specific passages of
Scripture cited in support of the doctrine maintained, and the mode of
interpreting them, or as to the methods of explanation applied to the
texts alleged by the Arian writers in favour of their own opinions, can
hardly fail to be struck by the number and the closeness of the
resemblances which he will be able to trace between the earlier and the
later representatives of the Nicene School. A somewhat similar relation
to the Athanasian position, as regards the basis of belief, and
(allowing for the difference of terminology) as regards the definition
of doctrine, may be observed in the *Oratio Catechetica.*

<span id="vii.iv-p29"></span>Such originality, in fact, as S. Gregory
may claim to possess (so far as his treatment of this subject is
concerned) is rather the originality of the tactician than that of the
strategist: he deals rather with his particular opponent, and keeps in
view the particular point in discussion more than the general area over
which the war extends. S. Athanasius, on the other hand (partly, no
doubt, because he was dealing with a less fully developed form of
error), seems to have more force left in reserve. He presents his
arguments in a more concise form, and is sometimes content to suggest an
inference where S. Gregory proceeds to draw out conclusions in detail,
and where thereby the latter, while possibly strengthening his
presentment of the truth as against his own particular
adversary,—against the Anomœan or the polytheist on the one side, or
against the Sabellian or the Judaizer on the other,—renders his
argument, when considered *per se* as a defence of the orthodox
position, frequently more diffuse and sometimes less forcible. Yet, even
here, originality of a certain kind does belong to S. Gregory, and it
seems only fair to him to say that in these treatises also he did good
service in defence of the Faith touching the Holy Trinity. He shows that
alike by way of formal statement of doctrine, as in the *Oratio
Catechetica,* and by way of polemical argument, the forces at the
command of the defenders of the Faith could be organized to meet varied
forms of error, without abandoning, either for a more original theology
like that or Marcellus of Ancyra, or for the compromise which the Homœan
or Semi-Arian school were in danger of being led to accept, the weapons
with which S. Athanasius had conquered at Nicæa.

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span> It is to be noted further that the use of
the terms “*Persona*” and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p5.1"></span>πρόσωπον</span> by those who avoided the phrase
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p5.2"></span>τρεῖς
ὑποστάσεις</span> no doubt assisted in the formation of this suspicion.
At the same time the Nicene anathema favoured the sense of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p5.3"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p5.4"></span>πόστασις</span> as
equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span

Eastern use.

Basil for the subscription of Eustathius).

<span id="fn_42"></span>[XXV:44](2050010.htm#fr_42.md) <span
id="vii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p10"></span> It appears on the whole more probable that
the treatise is the work of S. Gregory; but it is found, in a slightly
different shape, among the Letters of S. Basil. (Ep. 189<span
id="vii.iv-p10.1"></span> in the Benedictine Edition.)

<span id="fn_43"></span>[XXV:45](2050010.htm#fr_43.md) <span
id="vii.iv-p10.8"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p11"></span> In what sense this language was charged
with “novelty” is not very clear. But the point of the objection appears
to lie in a refusal to recognize that terms expressive of the Divine
Nature, whether they indicate attributes or operations of that Nature,
may be predicated of each <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p11.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p11.2"></span>πόστασις</span> severally, as well as of the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p11.3"></span>οὐσία</span>, without
attaching to the terms themselves that idea of plurality which, so far
as they express attributes or operations of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p11.4"></span>οὐσία</span>, must be
excluded from them.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[XXV:46](2050010.htm#fr_44.md) <span

<span id="vii.iv-p13"></span> S. Bas. Ep. 214<span

id="vii.iv-p13.9"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p14"></span> The *differentia* here assigned to the
Third Person is not, in S. Basil’s own view, a *differentia* at all: for
he would no doubt have been ready to acknowledge that this attribute is
common to all Three Persons. S. Gregory, as it will be seen, treats the
question as to the differentiation of the Persons somewhat differently,
and rests his answer on a basis theologically more scientific.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[XXVI:51](2050010.htm#fr_49.md) <span
id="vii.iv-p18.5"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p19"></span> This statement strikes at the root of the
theory held by Eunomius, as well as by the earlier Arians, that the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p19.1"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p19.2"></span>γεννησία</span> of the
Father constituted His Essence. S. Gregory treats His <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p19.3"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p19.4"></span>γεννησία</span> as that by
which He is distinguished from the other Persons, as an attribute
marking His hypostasis. This subject is treated more fully, with special
reference to the Eunomian view, in the *Ref. alt. libri Eunomii*.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[XXVI:52](2050010.htm#fr_50.md) <span
id="vii.iv-p19.7"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p20"></span> S. Gregory would apparently extend this
argument even to the operations expressed by the names of “Redeemer,” or
“Comforter;” though he would admit that in regard of the mode by which
these operations are applied to man, the names expressive of them are
used in a special sense of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, yet he would
argue that in neither case does the one Person act without the other
two.

Resurrectione,* and in that *De Conditione Hominis.* A notable instance
is to be found in the former (p. 242 A.).
