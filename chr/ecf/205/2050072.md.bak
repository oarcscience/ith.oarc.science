<span id="viii.i.iv.xiii"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iv.xiii-p1"></span> §13. *He expounds the passage of
the Gospel, “The Father judgeth no man,” and further speaks of the
assumption of man with body and soul wrought by the Lord, of the
transgression of Adam, and of death and the resurrection of the dead.*

<span id="viii.i.iv.xiii-p2"></span>Next he says, “He legislates by the
command of the Eternal God.” Who is the eternal God? and who is He that
ministers to Him in the giving of the Law? Thus much is plain to all,
that through Moses God appointed the Law to those that received it. Now
inasmuch as Eunomius himself acknowledges that it was the only-begotten
God Who held converse with Moses, how is it that the assertion before us
puts the Lord of all in the place of Moses, and ascribes the character
of the eternal God to the Father alone, so as, by thus contrasting Him
with the Eternal, to make out the only-begotten God, the Maker of the
Worlds, to be not Eternal? Our studious friend with his excellent memory
seems to have forgotten that Paul uses all these terms concerning
himself, announcing among men the proclamation of the Gospel by the
command of God <span id="fr_430"></span>[432](#fn_430.md) . Thus what the
Apostle asserts of himself, that Eunomius is not ashamed to ascribe to
the Lord of the prophets and apostles, in order to place the Master on
the same level with Paul, His own servant. But why should I lengthen out
my argument by confuting in detail each of these assertions, where the
too unsuspicious reader of Eunomius’ writings may think that their
author is saying what Holy Scripture allows him to say, while one who is
able to unravel each statement critically will find them one and all
infected with heretical knavery. For the Churchman and the heretic alike
affirm that “the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son <span id="fr_431"></span>[433](#fn_431.md) ,” but to this
assertion they severally attach different meanings. By the same words
the Churchman understands supreme authority, the other maintains
subservience and subjection.

<span id="viii.i.iv.xiii-p5"></span>But to what has been already said,
ought to be added some notice of that position which they make a kind of
foundation of their impiety in their discussions concerning the
Incarnation, the position, namely, that not the whole man has been saved
by Him, but only the half of man, I mean the body. Their object in such
a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less
exalted statements, which our Lord utters in His humanity, are to be
thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show
their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual
acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says,
“He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man
made up of soul and body.” But, after searching through all the inspired
and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the
Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for
man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of
necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of
salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired
Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is
being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came “to seek and
to save that which was lost <span id="fr_432"></span>[434](#fn_432.md) .”
Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and
body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul
was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the
body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from
which the whole disaster of our nature had its beginning, as the threat
of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that,
in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without
respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was
twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the
deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus
mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction
of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body
into its kindred elements: but “the soul that sinneth,” he saith, “it
shall die <span id="fr_433"></span>[435](#fn_433.md) .” Now sin is nothing
else than <span id="page_CXXVII">p. CXXVII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.xiii-Page_CXXVII"></span>alienation from God, Who is the
true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years
after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, “In the day
that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die <span
id="fr_434"></span>[436](#fn_434.md) .” For by the fact of his alienation
from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that
self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also
the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He
might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the
parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries
home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may
make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul.
And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now
the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the
result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with
Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the
first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the
destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, “They are dead which
sought the young Child’s life <span id="fr_435"></span>[437](#fn_435.md) ,”
(or “soul”): and the Lord says to the Jews, “Ye seek to kill Me, a man
that hath told you the truth <span id="fr_436"></span>[438](#fn_436.md) .”
Now by “Man” is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is
composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, “Are ye
angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath
day <span id="fr_437"></span>[439](#fn_437.md) ?” And what He meant by
“every whit whole,” He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the
man who was let down on a couch in the midst, “Thy sins be forgiven
thee,” which is a healing of the soul, and, “Arise and walk <span
id="fr_438"></span>[440](#fn_438.md) ,” which has regard to the body: and
in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own
malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, “Thou art
made whole, sin no more <span id="fr_439"></span>[441](#fn_439.md) ,” thou,
that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so
too does S. Paul speak, “for to make in Himself of twain one new
man <span id="fr_440"></span>[442](#fn_440.md) .” And so too He foretells
that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul
from His body, saying, “No man taketh” my soul “from Me, but I lay it
down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it
again <span id="fr_441"></span>[443](#fn_441.md) .” Yea, the prophet David
also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with
foresight of Him, “Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt
Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption <span
id="fr_442"></span>[444](#fn_442.md) ,” while the Apostle Peter thus
expounds the saying, that “His soul was not left in hell, neither His
flesh did see corruption.” For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh
and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at
all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the
suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for
our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without
being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was
once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been
thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an
example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that
all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put
on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine
nature by its union with God, as Peter said, “This same Jesus Whom ye
crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ <span
id="fr_443"></span>[445](#fn_443.md) ;” and we might cite many passages of
Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling
the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of
benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His
soul and touching them through His body. But it would be superfluous to
encumber our argument by entering into every detail.

<span id="viii.i.iv.xiii-p18"></span>Before passing on, however, to what
follows, I will further mention the one text, “Destroy this temple, and
in three days I will raise it up <span id="fr_444"></span>[446](#fn_444.md)
.” Just as we, through soul and body, become a temple of Him Who
“dwelleth in us and walketh in us <span
id="fr_445"></span>[447](#fn_445.md) ,” even so the Lord terms their
combination a “temple,” of which the “destruction” signifies the
dissolution of the soul from the body. And if they allege the passage in
the Gospel, “The Word was made flesh <span
id="fr_446"></span>[448](#fn_446.md) ,” in order to make out that the flesh
was taken into the Godhead without the soul, on the ground that the soul
is not expressly mentioned along with the flesh, let them learn that it
is customary for Holy Scripture to imply the whole by the part. For He
that said, “Unto Thee shall all flesh come <span
id="fr_447"></span>[449](#fn_447.md) ,” does not mean that the flesh will
be presented before the Judge apart from the souls: and when we read
<span id="page_CXXVIII">p. CXXVIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.xiii-Page_CXXVIII"></span>in sacred History that Jacob
went down into Egypt with seventy-five souls <span
id="fr_448"></span>[450](#fn_448.md) we understand the flesh also to be
intended together with the souls. So, then, the Word, when He became
flesh, took with the flesh the whole of human nature; and hence it was
possible that hunger and thirst, fear and dread, desire and sleep, tears
and trouble of spirit, and all such things, were in Him. For the
Godhead, in its proper nature, admits no such affections, nor is the
flesh by itself involved in them, if the soul is not affected
co-ordinately with the body.

[Next: He proceeds to discuss the views held by Eunomius, and by the
Church, touching the Holy Spirit; and to show that the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost are not three Gods, but one God. He also discusses
different senses of “Subjection,” and therein shows that the subjection
of all things to the Son is the same as the subjection of the Son to the
Father.](2050073.md)
