<span id="xiii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>Letter II</span>.—*To the City of
Sebasteia* <span id="fr_2166"></span>[2168](#fn_2166.md) .

<span id="xiii.iii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.iii-p3.1"></span>Some</span> of the brethren whose heart is as
our heart told us of the slanders that were being propagated to our
detriment by those who hate peace, and privily backbite their neighbour;
and have no fear of the great and terrible judgment-seat of Him Who has
declared that account will be required even of idle words in that trial
of our life which we must all look for: they say that the charges which
are being circulated against us are such as these; that we entertain
opinions opposed to those who at Nicæa set forth the right and sound
faith, and that without due discrimination and inquiry we received into
the communion of the Catholic Church those who formerly assembled at
Ancyra under the name of Marcellus. Therefore, that falsehood may not
overpower the truth, in another letter we made a sufficient defence
against the charges levelled at us, and before the Lord we protested
that we had neither departed from the faith of the Holy Fathers, nor had
we done anything without due discrimination and inquiry in the case of
those who came over from the communion of Marcellus to that of the
Church: but all that we did we did only after the orthodox in the East,
and our brethren in the ministry had entrusted to us the consideration
of the case of these persons, and had approved our action. But inasmuch
as, since we composed that written defence of our conduct, again some of
the brethren who are of one mind with us begged us to make
separately <span id="fr_2167"></span>[2169](#fn_2167.md) with our own lips
a profession of our faith, which we entertain with full conviction <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2170](#fn_2168.md) , following as we do the utterances
of inspiration and the tradition of the Fathers, we deemed it necessary
to discourse briefly of these heads as well. We confess that the
doctrine of the Lord, which He taught His disciples, when He delivered
to them the mystery of godliness, is the foundation and root of right
and sound faith, nor do we believe that there is aught else loftier or
safer than that tradition. Now the doctrine of the Lord is this: “Go,”
He said, “teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Since, then, in the case of
those who are regenerate from death to eternal life, it is through the
Holy Trinity that the life-giving power is bestowed on those who with
faith are deemed worthy of the grace, and in like manner the grace is
imperfect, if any one, whichever it be, of the names of the Holy Trinity
be omitted in the saving baptism—for the sacrament of regenera<span
id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span id="xiii.iii-Page_529"></span>tion is
not completed in the Son and the Father alone without the Spirit: nor is
the perfect boon of life imparted to Baptism in the Father and the
Spirit, if the name of the Son be suppressed: nor is the grace of that
Resurrection accomplished in the Father and the Son, if the Spirit be
left out <span id="fr_2169"></span>[2171](#fn_2169.md) :—for this reason we
rest all our hope, and the persuasion of the salvation of our souls,
upon the three Persons, recognized <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2172](#fn_2170.md) by these names; and we believe in
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is the Fountain of life, and in
the Only-begotten Son of the Father, Who is the Author of life, as saith
the Apostle, and in the Holy Spirit of God, concerning Whom the Lord
hath spoken, “It is the Spirit that quickeneth”. And since on us who
have been redeemed from death the grace of immortality is bestowed, as
we have said, through faith in the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Spirit, guided by these we believe that nothing servile, nothing
created, nothing unworthy of the majesty of the Father is to be
associated in thought with the Holy Trinity; since, I say, our life is
one which comes to us by faith in the Holy Trinity, taking its rise from
the God of all, flowing through the Son, and working in us by the Holy
Spirit. Having, then, this full assurance, we are baptized as we were
commanded, and we believe as we are baptized, and we hold as we believe;
so that with one accord our baptism, our faith, and our ascription of
praise are to <span id="fr_2171"></span>[2173](#fn_2171.md) the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. But if any one makes mention of two
or three Gods, or of three God-heads, let him be accursed. And if any,
following the perversion of Arius, says that the Son or the Holy Spirit
were produced from things that are not, let him be accursed. But as many
as walk by the rule of truth and acknowledge the three Persons, devoutly
recognized in Their several properties, and believe that there is one
Godhead, one goodness, one rule, one authority and power, and neither
make void the supremacy of the Sole-sovereignty <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2174](#fn_2172.md) , nor fall away into polytheism,
nor confound the Persons, nor make up the Holy Trinity of heterogeneous
and unlike elements, but in simplicity receive the doctrine of the
faith, grounding all their hope of salvation upon the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit,—these according to our judgment are of the same
mind as we, and with them we also trust to have part in the Lord.

<span id="xiii.iii-p2"></span> Marcellus of Ancyra had been deposed in
the Council of Constantinople in 336, for teaching the doctrine of Paul
of Samosata. Basil and Athanasius successively separated from their
communion all who were united to Marcellus; and these, knowing that
Valens the Emperor had exiled several bishops of Egypt to Diocæsarea,
went to find them (375) and were admitted to their communion. Armed with
letters from them, they demanded to be received into that of the other
bishops of the East, and at length Basil and others, having examined the
matter closely, admitted them. Gregory followed Basil’s example, being
assured of their Catholicity: and to justify himself wrote this letter
to the Catholics of Sebasteia.

The other N.T. use of this word, as an *active* and *passive*, is found
[2 Tim. iv. 5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md)<span

<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.iii-p5.12"></span>πεπληροφορημένων</span>, “most surely
believed” (A.V.): in all which the R.V. follows the Vulgate
interpretation. In the Latin translation of this passage in Gregory,
“(professionem) quâ sacris nos Scripturis ac Patrum traditioni penitus
inhærere persuasum omnibus foret,” the meaning put upon <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiii.iii-p5.13"></span>πληροφορεῖσθαι</span> by
A.V. in the last text is adopted, “we are fully believed to follow,”
with a very harsh construction.

<span id="fn_2169"></span>[529:2171](2050268.htm#fr_2169.md) <span
id="xiii.iii-p5.14"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p6"></span> There is some repetition and omission
here. Gregory ought to have said in one of the clauses, “Nor is Baptism
in the name of the Son and Holy Ghost sufficient, without the name of
the Father” (H. C. O.).

<span id="fn_2170"></span>[529:2172](2050268.htm#fr_2170.md) <span
id="xiii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p7"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.iii-p7.1"></span>γνωριζομένην</span> looks as if it ought to be
<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.iii-p7.2"></span>γνωριζομέναις</span>, and the Latin translator
renders accordingly (H. C. O.).

<span id="fn_2171"></span>[529:2173](2050268.htm#fr_2171.md) <span
id="xiii.iii-p7.3"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p8"></span> The same preposition <span

<span class="Greek"><span id="xiii.iii-p8.2"></span>βάπτισμα,
πίστις</span>, and <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="xiii.iii-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.iii-p9.1"></span>μοναρχία</span>, *i.e.* the One First Cause or
Principle. *See* p. 84, note 7.
