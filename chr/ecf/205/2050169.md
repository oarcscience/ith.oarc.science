<span id="ix.ii.ii.xx"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.xx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.xx-p2.1"></span>But</span> besides other things the action
of Miriam the prophetess also gives rise to these surmisings of ours.
Directly the sea was crossed she took in her hand a dry and sounding
timbrel and conducted the women’s dance <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1474](#fn_1472.md) . By this timbrel <span
id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span id="ix.ii.ii.xx-Page_365"></span>the
story may mean to imply virginity, as first perfected by Miriam; whom
indeed I would believe to be a type of Mary the mother of God <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1475](#fn_1473.md) . Just as the timbrel emits a loud
sound because it is devoid of all moisture and reduced to the highest
degree of dryness, so has virginity a clear and ringing report amongst
men because it repels from itself the vital sap of merely physical life.
Thus, Miriam’s timbrel being a dead thing, and virginity being a
deadening of the bodily passions, it is perhaps not very far removed
from the bounds of probability <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1476](#fn_1474.md) that Miriam was a virgin. However,
we can but guess and surmise, we cannot clearly prove, that this was so,
and that Miriam the prophetess led a dance of virgins, even though many
of the learned have affirmed distinctly that she was unmarried, from the
fact that the history makes no mention either of her marriage or of her
being a mother; and surely she would have been named and known, not as
“the sister of Aaron <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1477](#fn_1475.md) ,” but
from her husband, if she had had one; since the head of the woman is not
the brother but the husband. But if, amongst a people with whom
motherhood was sought after and classed as a blessing and regarded as a
public duty, the grace of virginity, nevertheless, came to be regarded
as a precious thing, how does it behove us to feel towards it, who do
not “judge” of the Divine blessings <span
id="fr_1476"></span>[1478](#fn_1476.md) “according to the flesh”? Indeed it
has been revealed in the oracles of God, on what occasion to conceive
and to bring forth is a good thing, and what species of fecundity was
desired by God’s saints; for both the Prophet Isaiah and the divine
Apostle have made this clear and certain. The one cries, “From fear of
Thee, O Lord, have I conceived <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[1479](#fn_1477.md) ;” the other boasts that he is the
parent of the largest family of any, bringing to the birth whole cities
and nations; not the Corinthians and Galatians only whom by his
travailings he moulded for the Lord, but all in the wide circuit from
Jerusalem to Illyricum; his children filled the world, “begotten” by him
in Christ through the Gospel <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1480](#fn_1478.md)
. In the same strain the womb of the Holy Virgin, which ministered to an
Immaculate Birth, is pronounced blessed in the Gospel <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1481](#fn_1479.md) ; for that birth did not annul the
Virginity, nor did the Virginity impede so great a birth. When the
“spirit of salvation <span id="fr_1480"></span>[1482](#fn_1480.md) ,” as
Isaiah names it, is being born, the willings of the flesh are useless.
There is also a particular teaching of the Apostle, which harmonizes
with this; viz. each man of us is a double man <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1483](#fn_1481.md) ; one the outwardly visible, whose
natural fate it is to decay; the other perceptible only in the secret of
the heart, yet capable of renovation. If this teaching is true,—and it
must be true <span id="fr_1482"></span>[1484](#fn_1482.md) because Wisdom
is speaking there,—then there is no absurdity in supposing a double
marriage also which answers in every detail to either man; and, maybe,
if one was to assert boldly that the body’s virginity was the
co-operator and the agent of the inward marriage, this assertion would
not be much beside the probable fact.
