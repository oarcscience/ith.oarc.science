<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p1"></span> §35. *Proof that the Anomœan
teaching tends to Manichæism.*

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p2"></span>We hear our Lord saying. “I and My
Father are one,” and we are taught in that utterance the dependence of
our Lord on a cause, and yet the absolute identity of the Son’s and the
Father’s nature; we do not let our idea about them be melted down into
One Person, but we keep distinct the properties of the Persons, while,
on the other hand, not dividing in the Persons the oneness of their
substance; and so the supposition of two diverse principles in the
category of Cause is avoided, and there is no loophole for the Manichæan
heresy to enter. For the created and the uncreate are as diametrically
opposed to each other as their names are; and so if the two are to be
ranked as First Causes, the mischief of Manichæism will thus under cover
be brought into the Church. I say this, because my zeal against our
antagonists makes me scrutinize their doctrine very closely. Now I think
that none would deny that we were bringing this scrutiny very near the
truth, when we said, that if the created be possessed of equal power
with the uncreate, <span id="page_LXXXII">p. LXXXII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-Page_LXXXII"></span>there will be some sort of
antagonism between these things of diverse nature, and as long as
neither of them fails in power, the two will be brought into a certain
state of mutual discord for we must perforce allow that will corresponds
with, and is intimately joined to nature; and that if two things are
unlike in nature, they will be so also in will. But when power is
adequate in both, neither will flag in the gratification of its wish;
and if the power of each is thus equal to its wish, the primacy will
become a doubtful point with the two: and it will end in a drawn battle
from the inexhaustibleness of their powers. Thus will the Manichæan
heresy creep in, two opposite principles appearing with counter claims
in the category of Cause, parted and opposed by reason of difference
both in nature and in will. They will find, therefore, that assertion of
diminution (in the Divine being) is the beginning of Manichæism; for
their teaching organizes a discord within that being, which comes to two
leading principles, as our account of it has shewn; namely the created
and the uncreated.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p3"></span>But perhaps most will blame this as
too strong a *reductio ad absurdum*, and will wish that we had not put
it down at all along with our other objections. Be it so; we will not
contradict them. It was not our impulse, but our adversaries themselves,
that forced us to carry our argument into such minuteness of results.
But if it is not right to argue thus, it was more fitting still that our
opponents’ teaching, which gave occasion to such a refutation, should
never have been heard. There is only one way of suppressing the answer
to bad teaching, and that is, to take away the subject-matter to which a
reply has to be made. But what would give me most pleasure would be to
advise those, who are thus disposed, to divest themselves a little of
the spirit of rivalry, and not be such exceedingly zealous combatants on
behalf of the private opinions with which they have become possessed,
and convinced that the race is for their (spiritual) life, to attend to
its interests only, and to yield the victory to Truth. If, then, one
were to cease from this ambitious strife, and look straight into the
actual question before us, he would very soon discover the flagrant
absurdity of this teaching.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p4"></span>For let us assume as granted what
the system of our opponents demands, that the having no generation is
Being, and in like manner again that generation is admitted into Being.
If, then, one were to follow out carefully these statements in all their
meaning, even this way the Manichæan heresy will be reconstructed seeing
that the Manichees are wont to take as an axiom the oppositions of good
and bad, light and darkness, and all such naturally antagonistic things.
I think that any who will not be satisfied with a superficial view of
the matter will be convinced that I say true. Let us look at it thus.
Every subject has certain inherent characteristics, by means of which
the specialty of that underlying nature is known. This is so, whether we
are investigating the animal kingdom, or any other. The tree and the
animal are not known by the same marks; nor do the characteristics of
man extend in the animal kingdom to the brutes; nor, again, do the same
symptoms indicate life and death; in every case, without exception, as
we have said, the distinction of subjects resists any effort to confuse
them and run one into another; the marks upon each thing which we
observe cannot be communicated so as to destroy that distinction. Let us
follow this out in examining our opponents’ position. They say that the
state of having no generation is Being; and they likewise make the
having generation Being. But just as a man and a stone have not the same
marks (in defining the essence of the animate and that of the inanimate
you would not give the same account of each), so they must certainly
grant that one who is non-generated is to be known by different signs to
the generated. Let us then survey those peculiar qualities of the
non-generated Deity, which the Holy Scriptures teach us can be mentioned
and thought of, without doing Him an irreverence.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p5"></span>What are they? I think no Christian
is ignorant that He is good, kind, holy, just and hallowed, unseen and
immortal, incapable of decay and change and alteration, powerful, wise,
beneficent, Master, Judge, and everything like that. Why lengthen our
discussion by lingering on acknowledged facts? If, then, we find these
qualities in the ungenerate nature, and the state of having been
generated is contrary <span id="fr_181"></span>[183](#fn_181.md) in its
very conception to the state of having not been generated, those who
define these two states to be each of them Being, must perforce concede,
that the characteristic marks of the generated being, following this
opposition existing between the generated and non-generated, must be
contrary to the marks observable in the non-generated being; for if they
were to declare the marks to be the same, this sameness would destroy
the difference between the two beings who are the subject of <span
id="page_LXXXIII">p. LXXXIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-Page_LXXXIII"></span>these observations. Differing
things must be regarded as possessing differing marks; like things are
to be known by like signs. If, then, these men testify to the same marks
in the Only-begotten, they can conceive of no difference whatever in the
subject of the marks. But if they persist in their blasphemous position,
and maintain in asserting the difference of the generated and the
non-generated the variation of the natures, it is readily seen what must
result: viz., that, as in following out the opposition of the names, the
nature of the things which those names indicate must be considered to be
in a state of contrariety to itself, there is every necessity that the
qualities observed in each should be drawn out opposite each other; so
that those qualities should be applied to the Son which are the reverse
of those predicated of the Father, viz., of divinity, holiness,
goodness, imperishability, eternity, and of every other quality that
represents God to the devout mind; in fact, every negation <span
id="fr_182"></span>[184](#fn_182.md) of these, every conception that ranks
opposite to the good, must be considered as belonging to the generated
nature.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p8"></span>To ensure clearness, we must dwell
upon this point. As the peculiar phænomena of heat and cold—which are
themselves by nature opposed to each other (let us take fire and ice as
examples of each), each being that which the other is not—are at
variance with each other, cooling being the peculiarity of ice, heating
of fire; so if in accordance with the antithesis expressed by the names,
the nature revealed by those names is parted asunder, it is not to be
admitted that the faculties attending these natural “subcontraries <span
id="fr_183"></span>[185](#fn_183.md) ” are like each other, any more than
cooling can belong to fire, or burning to ice. If, then, goodness is
inseparable from the idea of the non-generated nature, and that nature
is parted on the ground of being, as they declare, from the generated
nature, the properties of the former will be parted as well from those
of the latter: so that if the good is found in the first, the quality
set against the good is to be perceived in the last. Thus, thanks to our
clever systematizers, Manes lives again with his parallel line of evil
in array over against the good, and his theory of opposite powers
residing in opposite natures.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p10"></span>Indeed, if we are to speak the
truth boldly, without any reserve, Manes, who for having been the first,
they say, to venture to entertain the Manichæan view, gave his name to
that heresy, may fairly be considered the less offensive of the two. I
say this, just as if one had to choose between a viper and an asp for
the most affection towards man; still, if we consider, there is *some*
difference between brutes <span id="fr_184"></span>[186](#fn_184.md) . Does
not a comparison of doctrines show that those older heretics are less
intolerable than these? Manes thought he was pleading on the side of the
Origin of Good, when he represented that Evil could derive thence none
of its causes; so he linked the chain of things which are on the list of
the bad to a separate Principle, in his character of the Almighty’s
champion, and in his pious aversion to put the blame of any
unjustifiable aberrations upon that Source of Good; not perceiving, with
his narrow understanding, that it is impossible even to conceive of God
as the fashioner of evil, or on the other hand, of any other First
Principle besides Him. There might be a long discussion on this point,
but it is beside our present purpose. We mentioned Manes’ statements
only in order to show, that he at all events thought it his duty to
separate evil from anything to do with God. But the blasphemous error
with regard to the Son, which these men systematize, is much more
terrible. Like the others, they explain the existence of evil by a
contrariety in respect of Being; but when they declare, besides this,
that the God of the universe is actually the Maker of this alien
production, and say that this “generation” formed by Him into a
substance possesses a nature foreign to that of its Maker, they exhibit
therein more of impiety than the aforesaid sect; for they not only give
a personal existence to that which in its nature is opposed to good, but
they say that a Good Deity is the Cause of another Deity who in nature
diverges from His; and they all but openly exclaim in their teaching,
that there is in existence something opposite to the nature of the good,
deriving its personality from the good itself. For when we know the
Father’s substance to be good, and therefore find that the Son’s
substance, owing to its being unlike the Father’s in its nature (which
is the tenet of this heresy), is amongst the contrary predicables, what
is thereby proved? Why, not only that the opposite to the good subsists,
but that this contrary comes from the good itself. I declare this to be
more horrible even than the irrationality of the Manichees.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p12"></span>But if they repudiate this
blasphemy from their system, though it *is* the logical carrying out of
their teaching, and if they say that the Only-begotten has inherited the
excellences of the Father, not as being really His Son, but—so does it
please these misbelievers—as re<span id="page_LXXXIV">p. LXXXIV</span>
<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-Page_LXXXIV"></span>ceiving His personality by
an act of creation, let us look into this too, and see whether such an
idea can be reasonably entertained. If, then, it were granted that it is
as they think, viz., that the Lord of all things has not inherited as
being a true Son, but that He rules a kindred of created things, being
Himself made and created, how will the rest of creation accept this rule
and not rise in revolt, being thus thrust down from kinship to
subjection and condemned, though not a whit behind Him in natural
prerogative (both being created), to serve and bend beneath a kinsman
after all. That were like a usurpation, viz. not to assign the command
to a superiority of Being, but to divide a creation that retains by
right of nature equal privileges into slaves and a ruling power, one
part in command, the other in subjection; as if, as the result of an
arbitrary distribution <span id="fr_185"></span>[187](#fn_185.md) , these
same privileges had been piled at random on one who after that
distribution got preferred to his equals. Even man did not share his
honour with the brutes, before he received his dominion over them; his
prerogative of reason gave him the title to command; he was set over
them, because of a variance of his nature in the direction of
superiority. And human governments experience such quickly-repeated
revolutions for this very reason, that it is impracticable that those to
whom nature has given equal rights should be excluded from power, but
her impulse is instinct in all to make themselves equal with the
dominant party, when all are of the same blood.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xxxv-p14"></span>How, too, will it be true that
“all things were made by Him,” if it is true that the Son Himself is one
of the things made? Either He must have made Himself, for that text to
be true, and so this unreasonableness which they have devised to harm
our Faith will recoil with all its force upon themselves; or else, if
this is absurdly unnatural, that affirmation that the *whole* creation
was made by Him will be proved to have no ground to stand on. The
withdrawal of one makes “all” a false statement. So that, from this
definition of the Son as a created being, one of two vicious and absurd
alternatives is inevitable; either that He is not the Author of all
created things, seeing that He, who, they insist, is one of those works,
must be withdrawn from the “all;” or else, that He is exhibited as the
maker of Himself, seeing that the preaching that ‘without Him was not
anything (made) that was made’ is not a lie. So much for their teaching.
