<span id="xii.ii-p3"></span>————————————

<span id="xii.ii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xii.ii-p4.1"></span>The</span> number of the Apostles has been
enlarged for us by this our late Apostle being reckoned among their
company. These Holy ones have drawn to themselves one of like
conversation; those athletes a fellow athlete; those crowned ones
another crowned like them; the pure in heart one chaste in soul: those
ministers of the Word another herald of that Word. Most blessed, indeed,
is our Father for this his joining the Apostolic band and his departure
to Christ. Most pitiable we! for the unseasonableness of our orphaned
condition does not permit us to congratulate ourselves on our Father’s
happy lot. For him, indeed, better it was by his departure hence to be
with Christ, but it was a grievous thing for us to be severed from his
fatherly guidance. Behold, it is a time of need for counsel; and our
counsellor is silent. War, the war of heresy, encompasses us, and our
Leader is no more. The general body of the Church labours under disease,
and we find not the physician. See in what a strait we are. Oh! that it
were possible I could nerve my weakness, and rising to the full
proportions of our loss, burst out with a voice of lamentation adequate
to the greatness of the distress, as these excellent preachers of yours
have done, who have bewailed with loud voice the misfortune that has
befallen them in this loss of their father. But what can I do? How can I
force my tongue to the service of the theme, thus heavily weighted, and
shackled, as it were, by this calamity? How shall I open my mouth thus
subdued to speechlessness? How shall I give free utterance to a voice
now habitually sinking to the pathetic tone of lamentations? How can I
lift up the eyes of my soul, veiled as I am with this darkness of
misfortune? Who will pierce for me this deep dark cloud of grief, and
light up again, as out of a clear sky, the bright ray of peace? From
what quarter will that ray shine forth, now that our star has set? Oh!
evil moonless night that gives no hope of any star! With what an
opposite meaning, as compared with those of late, are our words uttered
in this place now! Then we rejoiced with the song of marriage, now we
give way to piteous lamentation for the sorrow that has befallen us!
Then we chanted an epithalamium, but now a funeral dirge! You remember
the day when we entertained you at the feast of that spiritual marriage,
and brought home the virgin bride to the house of her noble bridegroom;
when to the best of our ability we proffered the wedding gifts of our
praises, both giving and receiving joy in turn <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2064](#fn_2062.md) . But now our delight has been
changed to lamentation, and our festal garb become sackcloth. It were
better, maybe, to suppress our woe, and to hide our grief in silent
seclusion, so as not to disturb the children of the bride-chamber,
divested as we are of the bright marriage garment, and clothed instead
with the black robe of the preacher. For since that noble bridegroom has
been taken from us, sorrow has all at once clothed us in the garb of
black; nor is it possible for us to indulge in the usual cheerfulness of
our conversation, since Envy <span id="fr_2063"></span>[2065](#fn_2063.md)
has stripped us of our proper and be<span id="page_514">p. 514</span>
<span id="xii.ii-Page_514"></span>coming dress. Rich in blessings we
came to you; now we leave you bare and poor. The lamp we held right
above our head, shining with the rich fulness of light, we now carry
away quenched, its bright flame all dissolved into smoke and dust. We
held our great treasure in an earthen vessel. Vanished is the treasure,
and the earthen vessel, emptied of its wealth, is restored to them who
gave it <span id="fr_2064"></span>[2066](#fn_2064.md) . What shall we say
who have consigned it? What answer will they make by whom it is demanded
back? Oh! miserable shipwreck! How, even with the harbour around us,
have we gone to pieces with our hopes! How has the vessel, fraught with
a thousand bales of goods, sunk with all its cargo, and left us
destitute who were once so rich! Where is that bright sail which was
ever filled by the Holy Ghost? Where is that safe helm of our souls
which steered us while we sailed unhurt over the swelling waves of
heresy? Where that immovable anchor of intelligence which held us in
absolute security and repose after our toils? Where that excellent
pilot <span id="fr_2065"></span>[2067](#fn_2065.md) who steered our bark to
its heavenly goal? Is, then, what has happened of small moment, and is
my passionate grief unreasoning? Is it not rather that I reach not the
full extent of our loss, though I exceed in the loudness of my
expression of grief? Lend me, oh lend me, my brethren, the tear of
sympathy. When you were glad we shared your gladness. Repay us,
therefore, this sad recompense. “Rejoice with them that do rejoice <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2068](#fn_2066.md) .” This *we* have done. It is for
*you* to return it by “weeping with them that weep.” It happened once
that a strange people bewailed the loss of the patriarch Jacob, and made
the misfortune of another people their own, when his united family
transported their father out of Egypt, and lamented in another land the
loss that had befallen them. They all prolonged their mourning over him
for thirty days and as many nights <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2069](#fn_2067.md) . Ye, therefore, that are brethren,
and of the same kindred, do as they who were of another kindred did. On
that occasion the tear of strangers was shed in common with that of
countrymen; be it shed in common now, for common is the grief. Behold
these your patriarchs. All these are children of our Jacob. All these
are children of the free-woman <span
id="fr_2068"></span>[2070](#fn_2068.md) . No one is base born, no one
supposititious. Nor indeed would it have become that Saint to introduce
into the nobility of the family of Faith a bond-woman’s kindred.
Therefore is he our father because he was the father of our father <span
id="fr_2069"></span>[2071](#fn_2069.md) . Ye have just heard what and how
great things an Ephraim and a Manasses <span
id="fr_2070"></span>[2072](#fn_2070.md) related of their father, and how
the wonders of the story surpassed description. Give me also leave to
speak on them. For this beatification of him from henceforth incurs no
risk. Neither fear I Envy; for what worse evil can it do me? Know, then,
what the man was; one of the nobility of the East, blameless, just,
genuine, devout, innocent of any evil deed. Indeed the great Job will
not be jealous if he who imitated him be decked with the like
testimonials of praise. But Envy, that has an eye for all things fair,
cast a bitter glance upon our blessedness; and one who stalks up and
down the world also stalked in our midst, and broadly stamped the
foot-mark of affliction on our happy state. It is not herds of oxen or
sheep <span id="fr_2071"></span>[2073](#fn_2071.md) that he has maltreated,
unless in a mystical sense one transfers the idea of a flock to the
Church. It is not in these that we have received injury from Envy; it is
not in asses or camels that he has wrought us loss, neither has he
excruciated our bodily feelings by a wound in the flesh; no, but he has
robbed us of our very head. And with that head have gone away from us
the precious organs of our senses. That eye which beheld the things of
heaven is no longer ours, nor that ear which listened to the Divine
voice, nor that tongue with its pure devotion to truth <span
id="fr_2072"></span>[2074](#fn_2072.md) . Where is that sweet serenity of
his eyes? Where that bright smile upon his lips? Where that courteous
right hand with fingers outstretched to accompany the benediction of the
mouth. I feel an impulse, as if I were on the stage, to shout aloud for
our calamity. Oh! Church, I pity you. To you, the city of Antioch, I
address my words. I pity you for this sudden reversal. How has your
beauty been despoiled! How have you been robbed of your ornaments! How
suddenly has the flower faded! “Verily the grass withereth and the
flower thereof falleth away <span id="fr_2073"></span>[2075](#fn_2073.md)
.” What evil eye, what witchery of drunken malice has intruded on that
distant Church? What is there to compensate her loss? The fountain has
failed. The stream has dried up. Again has water been turned into
blood <span id="fr_2074"></span>[2076](#fn_2074.md) . Oh! the sad tidings
which tell the Church of her calamity! <span id="page_515">p. 515</span>
<span id="xii.ii-Page_515"></span>Who shall say to the children that
they have no more a father? Who shall tell the Bride she is a widow?
Alas for their woes! What did they send out? What do they receive back?
They sent forth an ark, they receive back a coffin. The ark, my
brethren, was that man of God; an ark containing in itself the Divine
and mystic things. There was the golden vessel full of Divine manna,
that celestial food <span id="fr_2075"></span>[2077](#fn_2075.md) . In it
were the Tables of the Covenant written on the tablets of the heart, not
with ink but by the Spirit of the living God <span
id="fr_2076"></span>[2078](#fn_2076.md) . For on that pure heart no gloomy
or inky thought was imprinted. In it, too, were the pillars, the steps,
the chapters, the lamps, the mercy-seat, the baths, the veils of the
entrances. In it was the rod of the priesthood, which budded in the
hands of our Saint; and whatever else we have heard the Ark
contained <span id="fr_2077"></span>[2079](#fn_2077.md) was all held in the
soul of that man. But in their stead what is there now? Let description
cease. Cloths of pure white linen scarves of silk, abundance of perfumes
and spices; the loving munificence of a modest and beautiful lady <span
id="fr_2078"></span>[2080](#fn_2078.md) . For it must be told, so as to be
for a memorial of her <span id="fr_2079"></span>[2081](#fn_2079.md) , what
*she* did for that Priest when, without stint, she poured the alabaster
box of ointment on his head. But the treasure preserved within, what is
it? Bones, now dead, and which even before dissolution had rehearsed
their dying, the sad memorials of our affliction. Oh! what a cry like
that of old will be heard in Rama, Rachel weeping <span
id="fr_2080"></span>[2082](#fn_2080.md) , not for her children but for a
husband, and admitting not of consolation. Let alone, ye that would
console; let alone; force not on us your consolation <span
id="fr_2081"></span>[2083](#fn_2081.md) . Let the widow indulge the
deepness of her grief. Let her feel the loss that has been inflicted on
her. Yet she is not without previous practice in separation. In those
contests in which our athlete was engaged she had before been trained to
bear to be left. Certainly you must remember how a previous sermon to
ours related to you the contests of the man; how throughout, even in the
very number of his contests, he had maintained the glory of the Holy
Trinity, which he ever glorified; for there were three trying attacks
that he had to repel. You have heard the whole series of his labours,
what he was in the first, what in the middle, and what in the last. I
deem it superfluous to repeat what has been so well described. Yet it
may not be out of place to add just so much as this. When that Church,
so sound in the faith, at the first beheld the man, she saw features
truly formed <span id="fr_2082"></span>[2084](#fn_2082.md) after the image
of God, she saw love welling forth, she saw grace poured around his
lips, a consummate perfection of humility beyond which it is impossible
to conceive any thing further, a gentleness like that of David, the
understanding of Solomon, a goodness like that of Moses, a strictness as
of Samuel, a chastity as of Joseph, the skill of a Daniel, a zeal for
the faith such as was in the great Elijah, a purity of body like that of
the lofty-minded John <span id="fr_2083"></span>[2085](#fn_2083.md) , an
unsurpassable love as of Paul. She saw the concurrence of so many
excellences in one soul, and, thrilled with a blessed affection, she
loved him, her own bridegroom, with a pure and virtuous passion. But ere
she could accomplish her desire, ere she could satisfy her longing,
while still in the fervour of her passion, she was left desolate, when
those trying times called the athlete to his contests. While, then, he
was engaged in these toilsome struggles for religion, she remained
chaste and kept the marriage vow. A long time intervened, during which
one, with adulterous intent <span id="fr_2084"></span>[2086](#fn_2084.md) ,
made an attempt upon the immaculate bridal-chamber. But the Bride
remained undefiled; and again there was a return, and again an exile.
And thus it happened thrice, until the Lord dispelled the gloom of that
heresy, and sending forth a ray of peace gave us the hope of some
respite from these lengthened troubles <span
id="fr_2085"></span>[2087](#fn_2085.md) . But when at length they had seen
each other, when there was a renewal of those chaste joys and spiritual
desires, when the flame of love had again been lit, all at once his last
departure breaks off the enjoyment. He came to adorn you as his bride,
he failed not in the eagerness of his zeal, he placed on this fair union
the chaplets of blessing, in imitation of his Master. As did the Lord at
Cana of Galilee <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2088](#fn_2086.md) , so here did
this imitator of Christ. The Jewish waterpots, which were filled with
the water of heresy, he filled with genuine wine, changing its nature by
the power of his faith. How often did he set before you a chalice, but
not of wine, when with that sweet <span id="page_516">p. 516</span>
<span id="xii.ii-Page_516"></span>voice he poured out in rich abundance
the wine of Grace, and presented to you the full and varied feast of
reason! He went first with the blessing of his words, and then his
illustrious disciples were employed in distributing his teaching to the
multitude.

<span id="xii.ii-p30"></span>We, too, were glad, and made our own the
glory of your nation <span id="fr_2087"></span>[2089](#fn_2087.md) . Up to
this point how bright and happy is our narrative. What a blessed thing
it were with this to bring our sermon to an end. But after these things
what follows? “Call for the mourning women <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2090](#fn_2088.md) ,” as says the prophet Jeremiah. In
no other way can the burning heart cool down, swelling as it is with its
affliction, unless it relieves itself by sobs and tears. Formerly the
hope of his return consoled us for the pang of separation, but now he
has been torn from us by that final separation. A huge intervening chasm
is fixed between the Church and him. He rests indeed in the bosom of
Abraham, but there exists not one who might bring the drop of water to
cool the tongue of the agonized. Gone is that beauty, silent is that
voice, closed are those lips, fled that grace. Our happy state has
become a tale that is told. Elijah of old time caused grief to the
people of Israel when he soared from earth to God. But Elisha <span
id="fr_2089"></span>[2091](#fn_2089.md) consoled them for the loss by being
adorned with the mantle of his master. But now our wound is beyond
healing; our Elijah has been caught up, and no Elisha left behind in his
place. You have heard certain mournful and lamenting words of Jeremiah,
with which he bewailed Jerusalem as a deserted city, and how among other
expressions of passionate grief he added this, “The ways of Zion do
mourn <span id="fr_2090"></span>[2092](#fn_2090.md) .” These words were
uttered then, but now they have been realized. For when the news of our
calamity shall have been spread abroad, then will the ways be full of
mourning crowds, and the sheep of his flock will pour themselves forth,
and like the Ninevites utter the voice of lamentation <span
id="fr_2091"></span>[2093](#fn_2091.md) , or, rather, will lament more
bitterly than they. For in their case their mourning released them from
the cause of their fear, but with these no hope of release from their
distress removes their need of mourning. I know, too, of another
utterance of Jeremiah, which is reckoned among the books of the
Psalms <span id="fr_2092"></span>[2094](#fn_2092.md) ; it is that which he
made over the captivity of Israel. The words run thus: “We hung our
harps upon the willows, and condemned ourselves as well as our harps to
silence.” I make this song my own. For when I see the *confusion* of
heresy, this *confusion* is Babylon <span
id="fr_2093"></span>[2095](#fn_2093.md) . And when I see the flood of
trials that pours in upon us from this confusion, I say that these are
“the waters of Babylon by which we sit down, and weep” because there is
no one to guide us over them. Even if you mention the *willows*, and the
*harps* that hung thereon, that part also of the figure shall be mine.
For in truth our life is among willows <span
id="fr_2094"></span>[2096](#fn_2094.md) , the willow being a fruitless
tree, and the sweet fruit of our life having all withered away.
Therefore have we become fruitless willows, and the harps of love we
hung upon those trees are idle and unvibrating. “If I forget thee, oh
Jerusalem,” he adds, “may my right hand be forgotten.” Suffer me to make
a slight alteration in that text. It is not we who have forgotten the
*right hand,* but the *right hand* that has forgotten us: and the
“tongue has cleaved to the roof of” his own “mouth,” and barred the
passage of his words, so that we can never again hear that sweet voice.
But let me have all tears wiped away, for I feel that I am indulging
more than is right in this womanish sorrow for our loss.

<span id="xii.ii-p39"></span>Our Bridegroom has not been taken from us.
He stands in our midst, though we see him not. The Priest is within the
holy place. He is entered into that within the veil, whither our
forerunner Christ has entered for us <span
id="fr_2095"></span>[2097](#fn_2095.md) . He has left behind him the
curtain of the flesh. No longer does he pray to the type or shadow of
the things in heaven, but he looks upon the very embodiment of these
realities. No longer through a glass darkly does he intercede with God,
but face to face he intercedes with Him: and he intercedes for us <span
id="fr_2096"></span>[2098](#fn_2096.md) , and for the “negligences and
ignorances” of the people. He has put away the coats of skin <span
id="fr_2097"></span>[2099](#fn_2097.md) ; no need is there now for the
dwellers in paradise of such garments as these; but he wears the raiment
which the purity of his life has woven into a glorious dress. “Precious
in the sight of the Lord is the death <span
id="fr_2098"></span>[2100](#fn_2098.md) ” of such a man, or rather it is
not death, but the breaking of bonds, as it is said, “Thou hast broken
my bonds asunder.” <span id="page_517">p. 517</span> <span
id="xii.ii-Page_517"></span>Simeon has been let depart <span
id="fr_2099"></span>[2101](#fn_2099.md) . He has been freed from the
bondage of the body. The “snare is broken and the bird hath flown
away <span id="fr_2100"></span>[2102](#fn_2100.md) .” He has left Egypt
behind, this material life. He has crossed <span
id="fr_2101"></span>[2103](#fn_2101.md) , not this Red Sea of ours, but the
black gloomy sea of life. He has entered upon the land of promise, and
holds high converse with God upon the mount. He has loosed the sandal of
his soul, that with the pure step of thought he may set foot upon that
holy land where there is the Vision of God. Having therefore, brethren,
this consolation, do ye, who are conveying the bones of our Joseph to
the place of blessing, listen to the exhortation of Paul: “Sorrow not as
others who have no hope <span id="fr_2102"></span>[2104](#fn_2102.md) .”
Speak to the people there; relate the glorious tale; speak of the
incredible wonder, how the people in their myriads, so densely crowded
together as to look like a sea of heads, became all one continuous body,
and like some watery flood surged around the procession bearing his
remains. Tell them how the fair <span
id="fr_2103"></span>[2105](#fn_2103.md) David distributed himself, in
divers ways and manners, among innumerable ranks of people, and danced
before that ark <span id="fr_2104"></span>[2106](#fn_2104.md) in the midst
of men of the same and of different language <span
id="fr_2105"></span>[2107](#fn_2105.md) . Tell them how the streams of
fire, from the succession of the lamps, flowed along in an unbroken
track of light, and extended so far that the eye could not reach them.
Tell them of the eager zeal of all the people, of his joining “the
company of Apostles <span id="fr_2106"></span>[2108](#fn_2106.md) ,” and
how the napkins that bound his face were plucked away to make amulets
for the faithful. Let it be added to your narration how the
Emperor <span id="fr_2107"></span>[2109](#fn_2107.md) showed in his
countenance his sorrow for this misfortune, and rose from his throne,
and how the whole city joined the funeral procession of the Saint.
Moreover console each other with the following words; it is a good
medicine that Solomon <span id="fr_2108"></span>[2110](#fn_2108.md) has for
sorrow; for he bids wine be given to the sorrowful; saying this to us,
the labourers in the vineyard: “Give,” therefore, “your wine to those
that are in sorrow <span id="fr_2109"></span>[2111](#fn_2109.md) ,” not
that wine which produces drunkenness, plots against the senses, and
destroys the body, but such as gladdens the heart, the wine which the
Prophet recommends when he says: “Wine maketh glad the heart of
man <span id="fr_2110"></span>[2112](#fn_2110.md) .” Pledge each other in
that liquor undiluted <span id="fr_2111"></span>[2113](#fn_2111.md) and
with the unstinted goblets of the word, that thus our grief may be
turned to joy and gladness, by the grace of the Only-begotten Son of
God, through Whom be glory to God, even the Father, for ever and ever.
Amen.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2061"></span>[513:2063](2050263.htm#fr_2061.md) <span
id="xii.ii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p2"></span> Meletius, Bishop of Antioch, died at
Constantinople, whither he had gone to attend the second Œcumenical
Council, <span class="c22"><span id="xii.ii-p2.1"></span>a.d</span>.
381. Of the “translation” of the remains to his own metropolis,
described in this oration, Sozomen (vii. 10) says, “The remains of
Meletius were at the same time conveyed to Antioch; and deposited near
the tomb of Babylas the Martyr. It is said that by the command of the
Emperor, the relics were received with honour in every city through
which they had to be conveyed, and that psalms were sung on the
occasion, a practice that was quite contrary to the usual Roman customs.
After the pompous interment of Meletius, Flavian was ordained in his
stead.…This gave rise to fresh troubles.” The rationale of the rising
relic-worship, at all events of the sanctity of tombs, is thus given by
Origen: “A feeling such as this (of bodies differing, as tenanted by
different souls) has prompted some to go so far as to treat as Divine
the remains of uncommon men; they feel that great souls have been there,
while they would cast forth the bodies of the morally worthless without
the honour of a funeral (ἀτιμάσαι). This perhaps is not the right thing
to do: still it proceeds from a right instinct (ἐννοίας ὑγιοῦς). For it
is not to be expected of a thinking man that he would take the same
pains over the burial of an Anytus, as he would over a Socrates, and
that he would place the same barrow or the same sepulchre over each”
(*c. Cels*. iv. 59). Again, “The dwelling-place of the reasoning soul is
not to be flung irreverently aside, like that of the irrational soul;
and more than this, we Christians believe that the reverence paid to a
body that has been tenanted by a reasoning soul *passes to him also* who
has received a soul which by means of such an instrument has *fought a
good fight*,” viii. 30.

<span id="fn_2062"></span>[513:2064](2050263.htm#fr_2062.md) <span
id="xii.ii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p5"></span> This all refers to the very recent
installation of Gregory of Nazianzum in the episcopal chair of
Constantinople: on which occasion also Gregory of Nyssa seems to have
preached.

<span id="fn_2063"></span>[513:2065](2050263.htm#fr_2063.md) <span
id="xii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p6"></span> Casaubon very strongly condemns the
sentiment here expressed, as savouring more of heathenism than
Christianity. He gives other instances, in which the loss from the death
of friends and good men is attributed by Christian writers to the envy
of a Higher Power. That the disturbed state of the Church should be
attributed by Gregory Nazianzen to “Envy” is well enough, but he in the
same strain as his namesake speaks thus in connection with the death of
his darling brother Cæsarius, and of Basil. Our Gregory uses the word
also in lamenting Pulcheria and Flacilla. It only proves, however, how
strong the habit still was of using heathen expressions.

Egyptian mourning was seventy days, but there is no precise mention of
the length of the Israelites’ mourning, except that at Atad, beyond the

schism of Antioch, which seemed as if it would disturb the whole East,
and even the West. Even the Catholics of Antioch had been divided,

that, at the death of either, the other should succeed to his “diocese.”

Agur, author of ch. xxx. But the suggestion of Eichhorn and Ewald is the
