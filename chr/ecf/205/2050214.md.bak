id="x.iii.i-p1.1"></span>On the Soul and the Resurrection.</span>

<span id="x.iii.i-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="x.iii.i-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.iii.i-p3.1"></span>Argument.</span>

<span id="x.iii.i-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="x.iii.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> mind, in times of bereavement,
craves a certainty gained by reasoning as to the existence of the soul
after death.

<span id="x.iii.i-p5"></span>First, then: Virtue will be impossible, if
deprived of the life of eternity, her only advantage.

<span id="x.iii.i-p6"></span>But this is a moral argument. The case
calls for speculative and scientific treatment.

<span id="x.iii.i-p7"></span>How is the objection that the nature of the
soul, as of real things, is material, to be met?

<span id="x.iii.i-p8"></span>Thus; the truth of this doctrine would
involve the truth of Atheism; whereas Atheism is refuted by the fact of
the wise order that reigns in the world. In other words, the
spirituality of God cannot be denied: and this proves the possibility of
spiritual or immaterial existence: and therefore, that of the soul.

<span id="x.iii.i-p9"></span>But is God, then, the same thing as the
soul?

<span id="x.iii.i-p10"></span>No: but man is “a little world in
himself;” and we may with the same right conclude from this Microcosm to
the actual existence of an immaterial soul, as from the phenomena of the
world to the reality of God’s existence.

<span id="x.iii.i-p11"></span>A Definition of the soul is then given,
for the sake of clearness in the succeeding discussion. It is a
*created, living, intellectual being*, with the power, as long as it is
provided with organs, of sensuous perception. For “the mind sees,” not
the eye; take, for instance, the meaning of the phases of the moon. The
objection that the “organic machine” of the body produces all thought is
met by the instance of the water-organ. Such machines, if thought were
really an attribute of matter, ought to build themselves spontaneously:
whereas they are a direct proof of an *invisible* thinking power in man.
A work of Art means mind: there is a thing perceived, and a thing not
perceived.

<span id="x.iii.i-p12"></span>But still, what *is* this thing not
perceived?

<span id="x.iii.i-p13"></span>If it has no sensible quality
whatever—Where is it?

<span id="x.iii.i-p14"></span>The answer is, that the same question
might be asked about the Deity (Whose existence is not denied).

<span id="x.iii.i-p15"></span>Then the Mind and the Deity are identical?

<span id="x.iii.i-p16"></span>Not so: in its substantial existence, as
separable from matter, the soul is *like* God; but this likeness does
not extend to sameness; it resembles God as a copy the original.

<span id="x.iii.i-p17"></span>As being “simple and uncompounded” the
soul survives the dissolution of the composite body, whose scattered
elements it will continue to accompany, as if watching over its property
till the Resurrection, when it will clothe itself in them anew.

<span id="x.iii.i-p18"></span>The soul was defined “an *intellectual*
being.” But anger and desire are not of the body either. Are there,
then, two or three souls?—Answer. Anger and desire do *not* belong to
the essence of the soul, but are only among its varying states; they are
not originally part of ourselves, and we can and must rid ourselves of
them, and bring them, as long as they continue to mark our community
with the brute creation, into the service of the good. They are the
“tares” of the heart, while they serve any other purpose.

<span id="x.iii.i-p19"></span>But where will the soul “accompany its
elements”?—Hades is not a particular spot; it means the Invisible; those
passages in the Bible in which the regions under the earth are alluded
to are explained as allegorical, although the partizans of the opposite
interpretation need not be combated.

<span id="x.iii.i-p20"></span>But how will the soul know the scattered
elements of the once familiar form? This is answered by two
illustrations (not analogies). The skill of the painter, the force that
has united numerous colours to form a single tint, will, if (by some
miracle) that actual tint was to fall back into those various colours,
be cognizant of each one of these last, *e.g.* the tone and size of the
<span id="page_429">p. 429</span> <span
id="x.iii.i-Page_429"></span>drop of gold, of red, &c.; and could at
will recombine them. The owner of a cup of clay would know its fragments
(by their shape) amidst a mass of fragments of clay vessels of other
shapes, or even if they were plunged again into their native clay. So
the soul knows its elements amidst their “kindred dust”; or when each
one has flitted back to its own primeval source on the confines of the
Universe.

<span id="x.iii.i-p21"></span>But how does this harmonize with the
Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus?

<span id="x.iii.i-p22"></span>The bodies of both were in the grave: and
so all that is said of them is in a *spiritual* sense. But the *soul*
can suffer still, being cognizant, not only of the elements of the whole
body, but of those that formed each member, *e.g.* the tongue. By the
relations of the Rich Man are meant the impressions made on his soul by
the things of flesh and blood.

<span id="x.iii.i-p23"></span>But if we must have no emotions in the
next world, how shall there be virtue, and how shall there be love of
God? For anger, we saw, contributed to the one, desire to the other.

<span id="x.iii.i-p24"></span>We shall be like God so far that we shall
always contemplate the Beautiful in Him. Now, God, in contemplating
Himself, has no desire and hope, no regret and memory. The moment of
fruition is always present, and so His Love is perfect, without the need
of any emotion. So will it be with us. God draws “that which belongs to
Him” to this blessed passionlessness; and in this very drawing consists
the torment of a passion-laden soul. Severe and long-continued pains in
eternity are thus decreed to sinners, not because God hates them, nor
for the sake alone of punishing them; but “because what belongs to God
must *at any cost* be preserved for Him.” The degree of pain which must
be endured by each one is necessarily proportioned to the measure of the
wickedness.

<span id="x.iii.i-p25"></span>God will thus be “all in all”; yet the
loved one’s form will then be woven, though into a more ethereal
texture, of the same elements as before. (This is not Nirvana.)

<span id="x.iii.i-p26"></span>Here the doctrine of the Resurrection is
touched. The Christian Resurrection and that of the heathen philosophies
coincide in that the soul is reclothed from *some* elements of the
Universe. But there are fatal objections to the latter under its two
forms:

<span id="x.iii.i-p27"></span>Transmigration pure and simple;

<span id="x.iii.i-p28"></span>The Platonic Soul-rotation.

<span id="x.iii.i-p29"></span>The first—

<span id="x.iii.i-p30"></span>1. Obliterates the distinction between the
mineral or vegetable, and the spiritual, world.

<span id="x.iii.i-p31"></span>2. Makes it a sin to eat and drink.

<span id="x.iii.i-p32"></span>Both—

<span id="x.iii.i-p33"></span>3. Confuse the moral choice.

<span id="x.iii.i-p34"></span>4. Make heaven the cradle of vice, and
earth of virtue.

<span id="x.iii.i-p35"></span>5. Contradict the truth that they assume,
that there is no change in heaven.

<span id="x.iii.i-p36"></span>6. Attribute every birth to a vice, and
therefore are either Atheist or Manichæan.

<span id="x.iii.i-p37"></span>7. Make a life a chapter of accidents.

<span id="x.iii.i-p38"></span>8. Contradict facts of moral character.

<span id="x.iii.i-p39"></span>God *is* the cause of our life, both in
body and soul.

<span id="x.iii.i-p40"></span>But *when* and *how* does the soul come
into existence?

<span id="x.iii.i-p41"></span>The *how* we can never know.

<span id="x.iii.i-p42"></span>There are objections to seeking the
material for any created thing either in God, or outside God. But we may
regard the whole Creation as the *realized thoughts* of God.
(Anticipation of Malebranche.)

<span id="x.iii.i-p43"></span>The *when* may be determined. Objections
to the existence of soul *before* body have been given above. But soul
is necessary to life, and the embryo lives.

<span id="x.iii.i-p44"></span>Therefore soul is not born *after* body.
So body and soul are born together.

<span id="x.iii.i-p45"></span>As to the number of souls, Humanity itself
is a thought of God not yet completed, as these continual additions
prove. When it is completed, this “progress of Humanity” will cease, by
there being no more births: and no births, no deaths.

<span id="x.iii.i-p46"></span>Before answering objections to the
Scriptural doctrine of the Resurrection, the passages that contain it
are mentioned: especially <span id="x.iii.i-p46.1"></span>[Psalm cxviii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)<span id="x.iii.i-p46.2"></span>
(LXX.).

<span id="x.iii.i-p47"></span>The various objections to it, to the
Purgatory *to follow*, and to the Judgment, are then stated; especially
that

<span id="x.iii.i-p48"></span>A man is not the same being (physically)
two days together. Which phase of him, then, is to rise again, be
tortured (if need be), and judged?

<span id="x.iii.i-p49"></span>They are all answered by a Definition of
the Resurrection, i.e. *the restoration of man to his original state*.
In that, there is neither age nor infancy; and the “coats of skins” are
laid aside.

<span id="x.iii.i-p50"></span>When the process of purification has been
completed, the better attributes of the soul appear—imperishability,
life, honour, grace, glory, power, and, in short, all that belongs to
human nature as the image of Deity.
