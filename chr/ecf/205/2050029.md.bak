<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p1"></span> §13. *Résumé of his dogmatic
teaching. Objections to it in detail.*

<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p2"></span>But somehow our discourse has
swerved considerably from the mark; it has had to turn round and face
each of this slanderer’s insults. To Eunomius indeed it is no small
advantage that the discussion should linger upon such points, and that
the indictment of his offences against man should delay our approach to
his graver sins. But it is profitless to abuse for hastiness of speech
one who is on his trial for murder; (because the proof of the latter is
sufficient to get the verdict of death passed, even though hastiness of
speech is not proved along with it); just so it seems best to subject to
proof his blasphemy only, and to leave his insults alone. When his
heinousness on the most important points has been detected, his other
delinquencies are proved potentially <span id="page_L">p. L</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xiii-Page_L"></span>without going minutely into them.
Well then; at the head of all his argumentations stands this blasphemy
against the definitions of the Faith—both in his former work and in that
which we are now criticizing—and his strenuous effort to destroy and
cancel and completely upset all devout conceptions as to the
Only-Begotten Son of God and the Holy Spirit. To show, then, how false
and inconsistent are his arguments against these doctrines of the truth,
I will first quote word for word his whole statement, and then I will
begin again and examine each portion separately. “The whole account of
our doctrines is summed up thus; there is the Supreme and Absolute
Being, and another Being existing by reason of the First, but after
It <span id="fr_103"></span>[105](#fn_103.md) though before all others; and
a third Being not ranking with either of these, but inferior to the one,
as to its cause, to the other, as to the energy which produced it: there
must of course be included in this account the energies that follow each
Being, and the names germane to these energies. Again, as each Being is
absolutely single, and is in fact and thought one, and its energies are
bounded by its works, and its works commensurate with its energies,
necessarily, of course, the energies which follow these Beings are
relatively greater and less, some being of a higher, some of a lower
order; in a word, their difference amounts to that existing between
their works: it would in fact not be lawful to say that the same energy
produced the angels or stars, and the heavens or man: but a pious mind
would conclude that in proportion as some works are superior to and more
honourable than others, so does one energy transcend another, because
sameness of energy produces sameness of work, and difference of work
indicates difference of energy. These things being so, and maintaining
an unbroken connexion in their relation to each other, it seems fitting
for those who make their investigation according to the order germane to
the subject, and who do not insist on mixing and confusing all together,
in case of a discussion being raised about Being, to prove what is in
course of demonstration, and to settle the points in debate, by the
primary energies and those attached to the Beings, and again to explain
by the Beings when the energies are in question, yet still to consider
the passage from the first to the second the more suitable and in all
respects the more efficacious of the two.”

<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p8"></span>Such is his blasphemy systematized!
May the Very God, Son of the Very God, by the leading of the Holy
Spirit, direct our discussion to the truth! We will repeat his
statements one by one. He asserts that the “whole account of his
doctrines is summed up in the Supreme and Absolute Being, and in another
Being existing by reason of the First, but after It though before all
others, and in a third Being not ranking with either of these but
inferior to the one as to its cause, to the other as to the energy.” The
first point, then, of the unfair dealings in this statement to be
noticed is that in professing to expound the mystery of the Faith, he
corrects as it were the expressions in the Gospel, and will not make use
of the words by which our Lord in perfecting our faith conveyed that
mystery to us: he suppresses the names of ‘Father, Son and Holy Ghost,’
and speaks of a ‘Supreme and Absolute Being’ instead of the Father, of
‘another existing through it, but after it’ instead of the Son, and of
‘a third ranking with neither of these two’ instead of the Holy Ghost.
And yet if those had been the more appropriate names, the Truth Himself
would not have been at a loss to discover them, nor those men either, on
whom successively devolved the preaching of the mystery, whether they
were from the first eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word, or, as
successors to these, filled the whole world with the Evangelical
doctrines, and again at various periods after this defined in a common
assembly the ambiguities raised about the doctrine; whose traditions are
constantly preserved in writing in the churches. If those had been the
appropriate terms, they would not have mentioned, as they did, Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, granting indeed it were pious or safe to remodel at
all, with a view to this innovation, the terms of the faith; or else
they were all ignorant men and uninstructed in the mysteries, and
unacquainted with what he calls the appropriate names—those men who
<span id="page_LI">p. LI</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xiii-Page_LI"></span>had really neither the knowledge nor
the desire to give the preference to their own conceptions over what had
been handed down to us by the voice of God.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p3"></span> *there is the Supreme and Absolute
Being, and another Being existing through the First, but after It.* The
language of this exposition of Eunomius is Aristotelian: but the
contents nevertheless are nothing more nor less than Gnosticism, as Rupp
well points out (Gregors v. Nyssa Leben und Meinungen, p. 132 sq.).
Arianism, he says, is nothing but the last attempt of Gnosticism to
force the doctrine of emanations into Christian theology, clothing that
doctrine on this occasion in a Greek dress. It was still an oriental
heresy, not a Greek heresy like Pelagianism in the next century.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p4"></span>Rupp gives two reasons why Arianism
may be identified with Gnosticism.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p5"></span>1. Arianism holds the <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p5.1"></span>Λόγος</span> as the
highest being after the Godhead, i.e. as the <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p5.2"></span>πρωτότοκος τῆς κτίσεως</span>, and as
merely the mediator between God and Man: just as it was the peculiar aim
of Gnosticism to bridge over the gulf between the Creator and the
Created by means of intermediate beings (the emanations).

<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p6"></span>2. Eunomius and his master adopted
that very system of Greek philosophy which had always been the natural
ally of Gnosticism: i.e. Aristotle is strong in divisions and
differences, weak in ‘identifications:’ he had marked with a clearness
never attained before the various stages upwards of existencies in the
physical world: and this is just what Gnosticism, in its wish to exhibit
all things according to their relative distances from the <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p6.1"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p6.2"></span>Αγέννητος</span>,
wanted.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p7"></span>Eunomius has in fact in this
formula of his translated all the terms of Scripture straight into those
of Aristotle: he has changed the ethical-physical of Christianity into
the purely physical; <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p7.1"></span>πνεύμα</span> e.g. becomes <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p7.2"></span>οὐσία</span>: and
by thus banishing the spiritual and the moral he has made his <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p7.3"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p7.4"></span>Αγέννητος</span> as
completely ‘single’ and incommunicable as the <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.iii.xiii-p7.5"></span>τὸ πρῶτον κίνουν ἀκίνητον</span>
(Arist. Metaph. XII. 7).
