<span id="xi.ii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>But</span> you will perhaps seek to know the
cause of this error of judgment; for it is to this point that the train
of our discussion tends. Again, then, we shall be justified in expecting
to find some starting-point which will throw light on this inquiry also.
An argument such as the following we have received by tradition from the
Fathers; and this argument is no mere mythical narrative, but one that
naturally invites our credence. Of all existing things there is a
twofold manner of apprehension, the consideration of them being divided
between what appertains to intellect and what appertains to the senses;
and besides these there is nothing to be detected in the nature of
existing things, as extending beyond this division. Now these two worlds
have been separated from each other by a wide interval, so that the
sensible is not included in those qualities which mark the intellectual,
nor this last in those qualities which distinguish the sensible, but
each receives its formal character from qualities opposite to those of
the other. The world of thought is bodiless, impalpable, and figureless;
but the sensible is, by its very name, bounded by those perceptions
which come through the organs of sense. But as in the sensible world
itself, though there is a considerable mutual opposition of its various
elements, yet a certain harmony maintained in those opposites has been
devised by the wisdom that rules the Universe, and thus there is
produced a concord of the whole creation with itself, and the natural
contrariety does not break the chain of agreement; in like manner, owing
to the Divine wisdom, there is an admixture and interpenetration of the
sensible with the intellectual department, in order that all things may
equally have a share in the beautiful, and no single one of existing
things be without its share in that superior world. For this reason the
corresponding locality of the intellectual world is a subtitle and
mobile essence, which, in accordance with its supramundane habitation,
has in its peculiar nature large affinity with the intellectual part.
Now, by a provision of the supreme Mind there is an intermixture of the
intellectual with the sensible world, in order that nothing in creation
may be thrown aside <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1958](#fn_1956.md) as
worthless, as says the Apostle, or be left without its portion of the
Divine fellowship. On this account it is that the commixture of the
intellectual and sensible in man is effected by the Divine Being, as the
description of the cosmogony instructs us. It tells us that God, taking
dust of the ground, formed the man, and by an inspiration from Himself
He planted life in the work of His hand, that thus the earthy might be
raised up to the Divine, and so one certain grace of equal value might
pervade the whole creation, the lower nature being mingled with the
supramundane. Since, then, the intellectual nature had a previous
existence, and to each of the angelic powers a certain operation was
assigned, for the organization of the whole, by the authority that
presides over all things, there was a certain power ordained to hold
together and sway the earthly region <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1959](#fn_1957.md) , constituted for this purpose by
the power that administers the Universe. Upon that there was fashioned
that thing moulded of earth, an “image” copied from the superior Power.
Now this living being was man. In him, by an ineffable influence, the
godlike beauty of the intellectual nature was mingled. He to whom the
administration of the earth has been consigned takes it ill and thinks
it not to be borne, if, of that nature which has been subjected to him,
any being shall be exhibited bearing likeness to his transcendent
dignity. But the question, how one who had been created for no evil
purpose by Him who framed the system of the Universe in goodness fell
away, nevertheless, into this passion of envy, it is not a part of my
present business minutely to discuss; though it would not be difficult,
and it would not take long, to offer an account to those who are
amenable to persuasion. For the distinctive difference between virtue
and vice is not to be contemplated as that between two actually
subsisting phenomena; but as there is a logical opposition between that
which is and that <span id="page_481">p. 481</span> <span
id="xi.ii.viii-Page_481"></span>which is not, and it is not possible to
say that, as regards subsistency, that which is not is distinguished
from that which is, but we say that nonentity is only *logically*
opposed to entity, in the same way also the word vice is opposed to the
word virtue, not as being any existence in itself, but only as becoming
thinkable by the absence of the better. As we say that blindness is
logically opposed to sight, not that blindness has of itself a natural
existence, being only a deprivation of a preceding faculty, so also we
say that vice is to be regarded as the deprivation of goodness, just as
a shadow which supervenes at the passage of the solar ray. Since, then,
the uncreated nature is incapable of admitting of such movement as is
implied in turning or change or alteration, while everything that
subsists through creation has connection with change, inasmuch as the
subsistence itself of the creation had its rise in change, that which
was not passing by the Divine power into that which is; and since the
above-mentioned power was created too, and could choose by a spontaneous
movement whatever he liked, when he had closed his eyes to the good and
the ungrudging like one who in the sunshine lets his eyelids down upon
his eyes and sees only darkness, in this way that being also, by his
very unwillingness to perceive the good, became cognisant of the
contrary to goodness. Now this is Envy. Well, it is undeniable that the
beginning of any matter is the cause of everything else that by
consequence follows upon it, as, for instance, upon health there follows
a good habit of body, activity, and a pleasurable life, but upon
sickness, weakness, want of energy, and life passed in distaste of
everything; and so, in all other instances, things follow by consequence
their proper beginnings. As, then, freedom from the agitation of the
passions is the beginning and groundwork of a life in accordance with
virtue, so the bias to vice generated by that Envy is the constituted
road to all these evils which have been since displayed. For when once
he, who by his apostacy from goodness had begotten in himself this Envy,
had received this bias to evil <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1960](#fn_1958.md) , like a rock, torn asunder from a
mountain ridge, which is driven down headlong by its own weight, in like
manner he, dragged away from his original natural propension to goodness
and gravitating with all his weight in the direction of vice, was
deliberately forced and borne away as by a kind of gravitation to the
utmost limit of iniquity; and as for that intellectual power which he
had received from his Creator to co-operate with the better endowments,
this he made his assisting instrument in the discovery of contrivances
for the purposes of vice, while by his crafty skill he deceives and
circumvents man, persuading him to become his own murderer with his own
hands. For seeing that man by the commission of the Divine blessing had
been elevated to a lofty pre-eminence (for he was appointed king over
the earth and all things on it; he was beautiful in his form, being
created an image of the archetypal beauty; he was without passion in his
nature, for he was an imitation of the unimpassioned; he was full of
frankness, delighting in a face-to-face manifestation of the personal
Deity),—all this was to the adversary the fuel to his passion of envy.
Yet could he not by any exercise of strength or dint of force accomplish
his purpose, for the strength of God’s blessing over-mastered his own
force. His plan, therefore, is to withdraw man from this enabling
strength, that thus he may be easily captured by him and open to his
treachery. As in a lamp when the flame has caught the wick and a person
is unable to blow it out, he mixes water with the oil and by this
devices will dull the flame, in the same way the enemy, by craftily
mixing up badness in man’s will, has produced a kind of extinguishment
and dulness in the blessing, on the failure of which that which is
opposed necessarily enters. For to life is opposed death, to strength
weakness, to blessing curse, to frankness shame, and to all that is good
whatever can be conceived as opposite. Thus it is that humanity is in
its present evil condition, since that beginning introduced the
occasions for such an ending.

<span id="xi.ii.viii-p4"></span> This is not making the Devil the
Demiurge, but only the “angel of the Earth.” And as the celestial
regions and atmosphere of the earth were assigned to “angelic powers,”
so the Earth itself and her nations were assigned to subordinate angels.
Origen had already developed, or rather christianized, this doctrine.
Speaking of the Confusion of Tongues, he says, “And so each (nation) had
to be handed over to the keeping of angels more or less severe, and of
this character or of that, according as each had moved a greater or less
distance from the East, and had prepared more or less bricks for stone,
and more or less slime for mortar; and had built up more or less. This
was that they might be punished for their boldness. These angels who had
already created for each nation its peculiar tongue, were to lead their
charges into various parts according to their deserts: one for instance
to some burning clime, another to one which would chastise the dwellers
in it with its freezing:…those who retained the original speech through
not having moved from the East are the only ones that became ‘the
portion of the Lord.’…They, too, alone are to be considered as having
been under a ruler who did not take them in hand to be punished as the
others were’ (*c.* *Cels.* v. 30–1).

<span id="xi.ii.viii-p5"></span> “We affirm that it is not easy, or
perhaps possible, even for a philosopher to know the origin of evil
without its being made known to him by an inspiration of God, whence it
comes, and how it shall vanish. Ignorance of God is itself in the list
of evils; ignorance of His way of healing and of serving Him aright is
itself the greatest evil: we affirm that no one whatever can possibly
know the origin of evil, who does not see that the standard of piety
recognized by the average of established laws is itself an evil. No one,
either, can know it who has not grasped the truth about the Being who is
called the Devil; what he was at the first, and how he became such as he
is.”—Origen (*c. Cels*. iv. 65).
