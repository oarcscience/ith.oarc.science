<span id="xi.ii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xli-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xli-p2.1"></span>For</span>, while all things else that are
born are subject to the impulse of those that beget them, the spiritual
birth is dependent on the power of him who is being born. Seeing, then,
that here lies the hazard, namely, that he should not miss what is for
his advantage, when to every one a free choice is thus open, it were
well, I think, for him who is moved towards the begetting of himself, to
determine by previous reasoning what kind of father is for his
advantage, and of what element it is better for him that his nature
should consist. For, as we have said, it is in the power of such a child
as this to choose its parents. Since, then, there is a twofold division
of existences, into created and uncreated, and since the uncreated world
possesses within itself immutability and immobility, while the created
is liable to change and alteration, of which will he, who with
calculation and deliberation is to choose what is for his benefit,
prefer to be the offspring; of that which is always found in a <span
id="page_507">p. 507</span> <span id="xi.ii.xli-Page_507"></span>state
of change, or of that which possesses a nature that is changeless,
steadfast, and ever consistent and unvarying in goodness? Now there have
been delivered to us in the Gospel three Persons and names through whom
the generation or birth of believers takes place, and he who is begotten
by this Trinity is equally begotten of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost—for thus does the Gospel speak of the Spirit, that
“that which is born of Spirit is spirit <span
id="fr_2043"></span>[2045](#fn_2043.md) ,” and it is “in Christ <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[2046](#fn_2044.md) ” that Paul begets, and the Father
is the “Father of all;” here, then, I beg, let the mind of the hearer be
sober in its choice, lest it make itself the offspring of some
inconstant nature, when it has it in its power to make the steadfast and
unalterable nature the founder of its life. For according to the
disposition of heart in one who comes to the Dispensation will that
which is begotten in him exhibit its power; so that he who confesses
that the Holy Trinity is uncreate enters on the steadfast unalterable
life; while another, who through a mistaken conception sees only a
created nature in the Trinity and then is baptized in *that,* has again
been born into the shifting and alterable life. For that which is born
is of necessity of one kindred with that which begets. Which, then,
offers the greater advantage; to enter on the unchangeable life, or to
be again tossed about by the waves of this lifetime of uncertainty and
change? Well, since it is evident to any one of the least understanding
that what is stable is far more valuable than what is unstable, what is
perfect than what is deficient, what needs not than what needs, and what
has no further to advance, but ever abides in the perfection of all that
is good, than what climbs by progressive toil, it is incumbent upon
every one, at least upon every one who is possessed of sense, to make an
absolute choice of one or other of these two conditions, either to
believe that the Holy Trinity belongs to the uncreated world, and so
through the spiritual birth to make It the foundation of his own life,
or, if he thinks that the Son or the Holy Ghost is external to the being
of the first, the true, the good, God, I mean, of the Father, not to
include these Persons in the belief which he takes upon him at the
moment of his new birth, lest he unconsciously make himself over to that
imperfect nature <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2047](#fn_2045.md) which itself
needs some one to make it good, and in a manner bring himself back again
to something of the same nature as his own by thus removing his
faith <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2048](#fn_2046.md) from that higher world.
For whoever has bound himself to any created thing forgets that, as from
the Deity, he has no longer hope of salvation. For all creation, owing
to the whole equally proceeding from non-existence into being, has an
intimate connection with itself; and as in the bodily organization all
the limbs have a natural and mutual coherence, though some have a
downward, some an upward direction, so the world of created things is,
viewed as the creation, in oneness with itself, and the differences in
us, as regards abundance or deficiency, in no wise disjoint it from this
natural coherence with itself. For in things which equally imply the
idea of a previous non-existence, though there be a difference between
them in other respects, as regards this point we discover no variation
of nature. If, then, man, who is himself a created being, thinks that
the Spirit and the Only-begotten God <span
id="fr_2047"></span>[2049](#fn_2047.md) are likewise created, the hope
which he entertains of a change to a better state will be a vain one;
for he only returns to himself <span
id="fr_2048"></span>[2050](#fn_2048.md) . What happens then is on a par
with the surmises of Nicodemus; he, when instructed by our Lord as to
the necessity of being born from above, because he could not yet
comprehend the meaning of the mystery, had his thoughts drawn back to
his mother’s womb <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2051](#fn_2049.md) . So that
if a man does not conduct himself towards the uncreated nature, but to
that which is kindred to, and equally in bondage with, himself, he is of
the birth which is from below, and not of that which is from above. But
the Gospel tells us that the birth of the saved is from above.
