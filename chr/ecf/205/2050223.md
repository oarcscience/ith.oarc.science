<span id="xi.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.v-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> so one who severely studies the
depths of the mystery, receives secretly in his spirit, indeed, a
moderate amount of apprehension of the doctrine of God’s nature, yet he
is unable to explain clearly in words the ineffable depth of this
mystery. As, for instance, how the same thing is capable of being
numbered and yet rejects numeration, how it is observed with
distinctions yet is apprehended as a monad, how it is separate as to
personality yet is not divided as to subject matter <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[1950](#fn_1948.md) . For, in personality, the Spirit
is one thing and the Word another, and yet again that from which the
Word and Spirit is, another. But when you have gained the conception of
what the distinction is in these, the oneness, again, of the nature
admits not division, so that the supremacy of the one First Cause is not
split and cut up into differing Godships, neither does the statement
harmonize with the Jewish dogma, but the truth passes in the mean
between these two conceptions, destroying each heresy, and yet accepting
what is useful to it from each. The Jewish dogma is destroyed by the
acceptance of the Word, and by the belief in the Spirit; while the
polytheistic error of the Greek school is made to vanish by the unity of
the Nature abrogating this imagination of plurality. While yet again, of
the Jewish conception, let the unity of the Nature stand; and of the
Hellenistic, only the distinction as to persons; the remedy against a
profane view being thus applied, as required, on either side. For it is
as if the number of the triad were a remedy in the case of those who are
in error as to the One, and the assertion of the unity for those whose
beliefs are dispersed among a number of divinities.

<span id="xi.ii.v-p3"></span> *it is separate as to personality yet is
not divided as to subject matter.* The words are respectively <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.1"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.2"></span>πόστασις</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.3"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.4"></span>ποκείμενον</span>. The last
word is with Gregory, whose clearness in philosophical distinctions
makes his use of words very observable, always equivalent to <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.5"></span>οὐσία</span>, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.6"></span>οὐσία</span> generally to
<span class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.7"></span>φύσις</span>. The
following note of Casaubon *(Epist. ad Eustath.)* is valuable: In the
Holy. Trinity there is neither “confusion,” nor “composition,” nor
“coalescing”; neither the Sabellian “contraction,” any more than the
Arian “division,” neither on the other hand “estrangement,” or
“difference.” There is “distinction” or “distribution” without division.
This word “distribution” is used by Tertullian and others to express the
effect of the “persons” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.v-p3.8"></span>ἰ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.ii.v-p3.9"></span>διότητες, ὑποστάσεις, πρόσωπα</span>) upon the
Godhead which forms the definition of the substance (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.10"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.ii.v-p3.11"></span>τῆς οὐσίας λόγος</span>).
