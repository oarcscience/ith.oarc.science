<span id="viii.i.xiv.i-Page_CCXL"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.i.xiv.i-p1.1"></span>Book XII.</span>

<span id="viii.i.xiv.i-p2"></span>§1. *This twelfth book gives a notable
interpretation of the words of the Lord to Mary, “Touch Me not, for I am
not yet ascended to My Father.”*

<span id="viii.i.xiv.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="viii.i.xiv.i-p3.1"></span>But</span> let us see what is the next
addition that follows upon this profanity, an addition which is in fact
the key of their defence of their doctrine. For those who would degrade
the majesty of the glory of the Only-begotten to slavish and grovelling
conceptions think that they find the strongest proof of their assertions
in the words of the Lord to Mary, which He uttered after His
resurrection, and before His ascension into heaven, saying, “Touch Me
not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father: but go to My brethren and
say unto them, I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God
and your God <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1020](#fn_1018.md) .” The orthodox
interpretation of these words, the sense in which we have been
accustomed to believe that they were spoken to Mary, is I think manifest
to all who have received the faith in truth. Still the discussion of
this point shall be given by us in its proper place; but meantime it is
worth while to inquire from those who allege against us such phrases as
“ascending,” “being seen,” “being recognized by touch,” and moreover
“being associated with men by brotherhood,” whether they consider them
to be proper to the Divine or to the Human Nature. For if they see in
the Godhead the capacity of being seen and touched, of being supported
by meat and drink, kinship and brotherhood with men, and all the
attributes of corporeal nature, then let them predicate of the
Only-begotten God both these and whatsoever else they will, as motive
energy and local change, which are peculiar to things circumscribed by a
body. But if He by Mary is discoursing with His brethren, and if the
Only-begotten has no brethren, (for how, if He had brethren, could the
property of being Only-begotten be preserved?) and if the same Person
Who said, “God is a Spirit <span id="fr_1019"></span>[1021](#fn_1019.md) ,”
says to His disciples, “Handle Me <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1022](#fn_1020.md) ,” that He may show that while the
Human Nature is capable of being handled the Divinity is intangible, and
if He Who says, “I go,” indicates local change, while He who contains
all things, “in Whom,” as the Apostle says, “all things were created,
and in Whom all things consist <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1023](#fn_1021.md) ,” has nothing in existent things
external to Himself to which removal could take place by any kind of
motion, (for motion cannot otherwise be effected than by that which is
removed leaving the place in which it is, and occupying another place
instead, while that which extends through all, and is in all, and
controls all, and is confined by no existent thing, has no place to
which to pass, inasmuch as nothing is void of the Divine fulness,) how
can these men abandon the belief that such expressions arise from that
which is apparent, and apply them to that Nature which is Divine and
which surpasseth all understanding, when the Apostle has in his speech
to the Athenians plainly forbidden us to imagine any such thing of God,
inasmuch as the Divine power is not discoverable by touch <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1024](#fn_1022.md) , but by intelligent contemplation
and faith? Or, again, whom does He Who did eat before the eyes of His
disciples, and promised to go before them into Galilee and there be seen
of them,—whom does He reveal Him to be Who should so appear to them?
God, Whom no man hath seen or can see <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1025](#fn_1023.md) ? or the bodily image, that is, the
form of a servant in which God was? If then what has been said plainly
proves that the meaning of the phrases alleged refers to that which is
visible, expressing shape, and capable of motion, akin to the nature of
His disciples, and none of these properties is discernible in Him Who is
invisible, incorporeal, intangible, and formless, how do they come to
degrade the very Only-begotten God, Who was in the beginning, and is in
the Father, to a level with Peter, Andrew, John, and the rest of the
Apostles, by calling them the brethren and fellow-servants of the
Only-begotten? And yet all their exertions are directed to this aim, to
show that in majesty of nature there is as great a distance between
<span id="page_CCXLI">p. CCXLI</span> <span
id="viii.i.xiv.i-Page_CCXLI"></span>the Father and the dignity, power,
and essence of the Only-begotten, as there is between the Only-begotten
and humanity. And they press this saying into the support of this
meaning, treating the name of the God and Father as being of common
significance in respect of the Lord and of His disciples, in the view
that no difference in dignity of nature is conceived while He is
recognized as God and Father both of Him and of them in a precisely
similar manner.

<span id="viii.i.xiv.i-p10"></span>And the mode in which they logically
maintain their profanity is as follows;—that either by the relative term
employed there is expressed community of essence also between the
disciples and the Father, or else we must not by this phrase bring even
the Lord into communion in the Father’s Nature, and that, even as the
fact <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1026](#fn_1024.md) that the God over all is
named as their God implies that the disciples are His servants so by
parity of reasoning, it is acknowledged, by the words in question, that
the Son also is the servant of God. Now that the words addressed to Mary
are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn
from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled
Himself to a level with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words.
And what is the meaning of what He then uttered, they may know in all
its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the sacred
mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few
words, following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father
of existent things, from Whom all things have their birth, has been
proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of the Apostle. “For there
is one God,” he says, “and Father, of Whom are all things <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1027](#fn_1025.md) .” Accordingly human nature did not
enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow spontaneously in
the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own
constitution none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead
itself, whether it indicates the authority of oversight or of
foresight <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1028](#fn_1026.md) , imports a certain
relation to humanity. For He Who bestowed on all things that are, the
power of being, is the God and overseer of what He has Himself produced.
But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of
disobedience, our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of
the Father’s image, but was transformed into the foul likeness of sin,
for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of similarity of will into the
evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and
Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus
outlawed by his own depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God,
those were honoured who, as the Apostle says, “by nature were no
Gods <span id="fr_1027"></span>[1029](#fn_1027.md) ,” and in the place of
the Father, he was deemed father who is falsely so called, as the
prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, “The partridge called, she
gathered together what she hatched not <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1030](#fn_1028.md) .” Since, then, this was the sum of
our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was
banished from the Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is
the Shepherd of the whole rational creation, left in the heights of
heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved by love, went
after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[1031](#fn_1029.md) . For human nature, which alone,
according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away
from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the
whole, but an insignificant and infinitesimal part. Since then it was
impossible that our life, which had been estranged from God, should of
itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith
the Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[1032](#fn_1030.md) , and frees us from the curse by
taking on Him our curse as His own <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1033](#fn_1031.md) , and having taken up, and, in the
language of the Apostle, “slain” in Himself “the enmity <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1034](#fn_1032.md) ” which by means of sin had come
between us and God,—(in fact sin *was* “the enmity”)—and having become
what we were, He through Himself again united humanity to God. For
having by purity brought into closest relationship with the Father of
our nature that new man which is created after God <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[1035](#fn_1033.md) , in Whom dwelt all the fulness of
the Godhead bodily <span id="fr_1034"></span>[1036](#fn_1034.md) , He drew
with Him into the same grace all the nature that partakes of His body
and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims through the
woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the
present day become disciples of the Word,—the tidings, namely, that man
is no longer outlawed, nor cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once
more a son, once more in the station assigned to him by his God,
inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is
hallowed <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1037](#fn_1035.md) . “For behold,” He
says, “I and the children whom God hath given Me <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[1038](#fn_1036.md) .” He Who for our sakes was
partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought <span
id="page_CCXLII">p. CCXLII</span> <span
id="viii.i.xiv.i-Page_CCXLII"></span>you back to the place whence ye
strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[1039](#fn_1037.md) . And so He from Whom we were
formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and our God.
Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings
of this benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the
Son, but the glad tidings of our reconciliation to God. For that which
has taken place in Christ’s Humanity is a common boon bestowed on
mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of the body,
which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the
heavens, we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also
“shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1040](#fn_1038.md) ,” even so, when we hear that the
true God and Father has become the God and Father of our First-fruits,
we no longer doubt that the same God has become our God and Father too,
inasmuch as we have learnt that we shall come to the same place whither
Christ has entered for us as our forerunner <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1041](#fn_1039.md) . And the fact too that this grace
was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation
which we have given. For since, as the Apostle tells us, “the woman,
being deceived, was in the transgression <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1042](#fn_1040.md) ,” and was by her disobedience
foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause she is the first witness
of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the
resurrection the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by
making herself at the beginning a minister and advocate to her husband
of the counsels of the serpent, she brought into human life the
beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by
ministering <span id="fr_1041"></span>[1043](#fn_1041.md) to His disciples
the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men the
guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death
is annulled. It is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more
profitable explanation of the text may be discovered. But even though
none such should be found, I think that every devout reader will agree
that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it
with that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated
to destroy the glory of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the
other includes in its scope the aim of the dispensation concerning man.
For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable, and
invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is
proper to humanity, that gave command to Mary to minister the word to
His disciples.

[Next: Then referring to the blasphemy of Eunomius, which had been
refuted by the great Basil, where he banished the Only-begotten God to
the realm of darkness, and the apology or explanation which Eunomius
puts forth for his blasphemy, he shows that his present blasphemy is
rendered by his apology worse than his previous one; and herein he very
ably discourses of the “true” and the “unapproachable” Light.](2050134.md)
