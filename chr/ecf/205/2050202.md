<span id="x.ii.ii.xxi"></span>

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxi-p1"></span> XX. *What was the life in Paradise,
and what was the forbidden tree* <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[1677](#fn_1675) ?

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxi-p3"></span>1. What then is that which includes the
knowledge of good and evil blended together, and is decked with the
pleasures of sense? I think I am not aiming wide of the mark in
employing, as a starting-point for my speculation, the sense of
“knowable <span id="fr_1676"></span>[1678](#fn_1676) .” It is not, I
think, “science” which the Scripture here means by “knowledge”; but I
find a certain distinction, according to Scriptural use, between
“knowledge” and “discernment”: for to “dis<span id="page_410">p.
410</span> <span id="x.ii.ii.xxi-Page_410"></span>cern” skilfully the
good from the evil, the Apostle says is a mark of a more perfect
condition and of “exercised senses <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[1679](#fn_1677) ,” for which reason also he bids us
“prove all things <span id="fr_1678"></span>[1680](#fn_1678) ,” and says
that “discernment” belongs to the spiritual man <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1681](#fn_1679) : but “knowledge” is not always to
be understood of skill and acquaintance with anything, but of the
disposition towards what is agreeable,—as “the Lord knoweth them that
are His <span id="fr_1680"></span>[1682](#fn_1680) ”; and He says to
Moses, “I knew thee above all <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1683](#fn_1681)
”; while of those condemned in their wickedness He Who knows all things
says, “I never knew you <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1684](#fn_1682) .”

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxi-p11"></span>2. The tree, then, from which comes
this fruit of mixed knowledge, is among those things which are
forbidden; and that fruit is combined of opposite qualities, which has
the serpent to commend it, it may be for this reason, that the evil is
not exposed in its nakedness, itself appearing in its own proper
nature—for wickedness would surely fail of its effect were it not decked
with some fair colour to entice to the desire of it him whom it
deceives—but now the nature of evil is in a manner mixed, keeping
destruction like some snare concealed in its depths, and displaying some
phantom of good in the deceitfulness of its exterior. The beauty of the
substance seems good to those who love money: yet “the love of money is
a root of all evil <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1685](#fn_1683) ”: and who
would plunge into the unsavoury mud of wantonness, were it not that he
whom this bait hurries into passion thinks pleasure a thing fair and
acceptable? so, too, the other sins keep their destruction hidden, and
seem at first sight acceptable, and some deceit makes them earnestly
sought after by unwary men instead of what is good.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxi-p13"></span>3. Now since the majority of men judge
the good to lie in that which gratifies the senses, and there is a
certain identity of name between that which is, and that which appears
to be “good,”—for this reason that desire which arises towards what is
evil, as though towards good, is called by Scripture “the knowledge of
good and evil;” “knowledge,” as we have said, expressing a certain mixed
disposition. It speaks of the fruit of the forbidden tree not as a thing
absolutely evil (because it is decked with good), nor as a thing purely
good (because evil is latent in it), but as compounded of both, and
declares that the tasting of it brings to death those who touch it;
almost proclaiming aloud the doctrine that the very actual good is in
its nature simple and uniform, alien from all duplicity or conjunction
with its opposite, while evil is many-coloured and fairly adorned, being
esteemed to be one thing and revealed by experience as another, the
knowledge of which (that is, its reception by experience) is the
beginning and antecedent of death and destruction.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxi-p14"></span>4. It was because he saw this that the
serpent points out the evil fruit of sin, not showing the evil
manifestly in its own nature (for man would not have been deceived by
manifest evil), but giving to what the woman beheld the glamour of a
certain beauty, and conjuring into its taste the spell of a sensual
pleasure, he appeared to her to speak convincingly: “and the woman saw,”
it says, “that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to
the eyes to behold, and fair to see; and she took of the fruit thereof
and did eat <span id="fr_1684"></span>[1686](#fn_1684) ,” and that
eating became the mother of death to men. This, then, is that
fruit-bearing of mixed character, where the passage clearly expresses
the sense in which the tree was called “capable of the knowledge of good
and evil,” because, like the evil nature of poisons that are prepared
with honey, it appears to be good in so far as it affects the senses
with sweetness: but in so far as it destroys him who touches it, it is
the worst of all evil. Thus when the evil poison worked its effect
against man’s life, then man, that noble thing and name, the image of
God’s nature, was made, as the prophet says, “like unto vanity <span
id="fr_1685"></span>[1687](#fn_1685) .”

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxi-p17"></span>5. The image, therefore, properly
belongs to the better part of our attributes; but all in our life that
is painful and miserable is far removed from the likeness to the Divine.
