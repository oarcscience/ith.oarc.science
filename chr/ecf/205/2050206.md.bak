<span id="x.ii.ii.xxv-p1"></span> XXIV. *An argument against those who
say that matter is co-eternal with God.* <span
id="fr_1707"></span>[1709](#fn_1707.md)

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxv-p3"></span>1. For after all that opinion on the
subject of matter does not turn out to be beyond what appears
consistent, which declares that it has its existence from Him Who is
intelligible and immaterial. For we shall find all matter to be composed
of certain qualities, of which if it is divested it can, in itself, be
by no means grasped by idea. Moreover in idea each kind of quality is
separated from the substratum; but idea is an intellectual and not a
corporeal method of examination. If, for instance, some animal or tree
is presented to our notice, or any other of the things that have
material existence, we perceive in our mental discussion of it many
things concerning the substratum, the idea of each of which is clearly
distinguished from the object we contemplate: for the idea of colour is
one, of weight another; so again that of quantity and of such and such a
peculiar quality of touch: for “softness,” and “two cubits long,” and
the rest of the attributes we spoke of, are not connected in idea either
with one another or with the body: each of them has conceived concerning
it its own explanatory definition according to its being, having nothing
in common with any other of the qualities that are contemplated in the
substratum.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxv-p4"></span>2.  <span
id="fr_1708"></span>[1710](#fn_1708.md) If, then, colour is a thing
intelligible, and resistance also is intelligible, and so with quantity
and the rest of the like properties, while if each of these should be
withdrawn from the substratum, the whole idea of the body is dissolved;
it would seem to follow that we may suppose the concurrence of those
things, the absence of which we found to be a cause of the dissolution
of the body, to produce the material nature: for as that is not a body
which has not colour, and figure, and resistance, and extension, and
weight, and the other properties, while each of these in its proper
existence is found to be not the body but something else besides the
body, so, conversely, whenever the specified attributes concur they
produce bodily existence. Yet if the perception of these properties is a
matter of intellect, and the Divinity is also intellectual in nature,
there is no incongruity in supposing that these intellectual occasions
for the genesis of bodies have their existence from the incorporeal
nature, the intellectual nature on the one hand giving being to the
intellectual potentialities, and the mutual concurrence of these
bringing to its genesis the material nature.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xxv-p6"></span>3. Let this discussion, however, be by
way of digression: we must direct our discourse once more to the faith
by which we accept the statement that the universe took being from
nothing, and do not doubt, when we are taught by Scripture, that it will
again be transformed into some other state.
