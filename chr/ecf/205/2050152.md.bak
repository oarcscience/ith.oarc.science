<span id="ix.ii.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>Deep</span> indeed will be the thought
necessary to understand the surpassing excellence of this grace. It is
comprehended in the idea of the Father incorrupt; and here at the outset
is a paradox, viz. that virginity is found in Him, Who has a Son and yet
without passion has begotten Him. It is included too in the nature of
this Only-begotten God, Who struck the first note of all this moral
innocence; it shines forth equally in His pure and passionless
generation. Again a paradox; that the Son should be known to us by
virginity. It is seen, too, in the inherent and incorruptible purity of
the Holy Spirit; for when you have named the pure and incorruptible you
have named virginity. It accompanies the whole supramundane existence;
because of its passionlessness it is always present with the powers
above; never separated from aught that is Divine, it never touches the
opposite of this. All whose instinct and will have found their level in
virtue are beautified with this perfect purity of the uncorrupted state;
all who are ranked in the opposite class of character are what they are,
and are called so, by reason of their fall from purity. What force of
expression, then, will be adequate to such a grace? How can there be no
cause to fear lest the greatness of its intrinsic value should be
impaired by the efforts of any one’s eloquence? The estimate of it which
he will create will be less than that which his hearers had before. It
will be well, then, to omit all laudation in this case; we cannot lift
words to the height of our theme. On the contrary, it is possible to be
ever mindful of this gift of God; and our lips may always speak of this
blessing; that, though it is the property of spiritual existence and of
such singular excellence, yet by the love of God it has been bestowed on
those who have received their life from the will of the flesh and from
blood; that, when human nature has been based by passionate
inclinations, it stretches out its offer of purity like a hand to raise
it up again and make it look above. This, I think, was the reason why
our Master, Jesus Christ Himself, the Fountain of all innocence, did not
come into the world by wedlock. It was, to divulge by the manner of His
Incarnation this great secret; that purity is the only complete
indication <span id="fr_1346"></span>[1348](#fn_1346.md) of the presence of
God and of His coming, and that no one can in reality secure this for
himself, unless he has altogether estranged himself from the passions of
the flesh. What happened in the stainless Mary when the fulness of the
Godhead which was in Christ shone out through her, that happens in every
soul that leads by rule the virgin life. No longer indeed does the
Master come with bodily presence; “we know Christ no longer accord<span
id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span id="ix.ii.ii.iii-Page_345"></span>ing
to the flesh <span id="fr_1347"></span>[1349](#fn_1347.md) ”; but,
spiritually, He dwells in us and brings His Father with Him, as the
Gospel somewhere <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1350](#fn_1348.md) tells.
Seeing, then, that virginity means so much as this, that while it
remains in Heaven with the Father of spirits, and moves in the dance of
the celestial powers, it nevertheless stretches out hands for man’s
salvation; that while it is the channel which draws down the Deity to
share man’s estate, it keeps wings for man’s desires to rise to heavenly
things, and is a bond of union between the Divine and human, by its
mediation bringing into harmony these existences so widely divided—what
words could be discovered powerful enough to reach this wondrous height?
But still, it is monstrous to seem like creatures without expression and
without feeling; and we must choose (if we are silent) one of two
things; either to appear never to have felt the special beauty of
virginity, or to exhibit ourselves as obstinately blind to all beauty:
we have consented therefore to speak briefly about this virtue,
according to the wish of him who has assigned us this task, and whom in
all things we must obey. But let no one expect from us any display of
style; even if we wished it, perhaps we could not produce it, for we are
quite unversed in that kind of writing. Even if we possessed such power,
we would not prefer the favour of the few to the edification of the
many. A writer of sense should have, I take it, for his chiefest object
not to be admired above all other writers, but to profit both himself
and them, the many.
