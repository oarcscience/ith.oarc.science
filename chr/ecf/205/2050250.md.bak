<span id="xi.ii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxii-p2.1"></span>If</span>, however, any one thinks to
refute our argument on this ground, that even after the application of
the remedial process the life of man is still in discord through its
errors, let us lead him to the truth by an example taken from familiar
things. Take, for instance, the case of a serpent; if it receives a
deadly blow on the head, the hinder part of the coil is not at once
deadened along with it; but, while the head is dead, the tail part is
still animated with its own particular spirit, and is not deprived of
its vital motion: in like manner we may see Sin struck its deadly blow
and yet in its remainders still vexing the life of man. But then they
give up finding fault with the account of Revelation on these points,
and make another charge against it; viz. that the Faith does not reach
all mankind. “But why is it,” they ask, “that all men do not obtain the
grace, but that, while some adhere to the Word, the portion who remain
unbelieving is no small one; either because God was unwilling to bestow
his benefit ungrudgingly upon all, or because He was altogether unable
to do so?” Now neither of these alternatives can defy criticism. For it
is unworthy of God, either that He should not will what is good, or that
He should be unable to do it. “If, therefore, the Faith is a good thing,
why,” they ask, “does not its grace come upon all men?” Now <span
id="fr_2009"></span>[2011](#fn_2009.md) , if in our representation of the
Gospel mystery we had so stated the matter as that it was the Divine
will that the Faith should be so granted away amongst mankind that some
men should be called, while the rest had no share in the calling,
occasion would be given for bringing such a charge against this
Revelation. But if the call came with equal meaning to all and makes no
distinction as to worth, age, or different national characteristics (for
it was for this reason that at the very first beginning of the
proclamation of the Gospel they who ministered the Word were, by Divine
inspiration, all at once enabled to speak in the language of any nation,
viz. in order that no one might be destitute of a share in the blessings
of evangelical instruction), with what reasonableness can they still
charge it upon God that the Word has not influenced all mankind? For He
Who holds the sovereignty of the universe, out of the excess of this
regard for man, permitted something to be under our own control, of
which each of us alone is master. Now this is the will, a thing that
cannot be enslaved, and of self-determining power, since it is seated in
the liberty of thought and mind. Therefore such a charge might more
justly be transferred to those who have not attached themselves to the
Faith, instead of resting on Him Who has called them to believe. For
even when Peter at the beginning preached the Gospel in a crowded
assembly of the Jews, and three thousand at once received the Faith,
though those who disbelieved were more in number than the believers,
they did not attach blame to the Apostle on the ground of their
disbelief. It was, indeed, not in reason, when the grace of the Gospel
had been publicly set forth, for one who had absented himself <span
id="page_499">p. 499</span> <span id="xi.ii.xxxii-Page_499"></span>from
it of his own accord to lay the blame of his exclusion on another rather
than himself.

<span id="xi.ii.xxxii-p3"></span> The following passage is
anti-Calvinistic. Gregory here, as continually elsewhere, asserts the
freedom of the will; and is strongly supported by Justin Martyr, i. 43:
“If it has been fixed by fate that one man shall be good, and another
bad, the one is not praiseworthy, the other not culpable. And again, if
mankind has not power by a free choice to flee the evil and to choose
the good, it is not responsible for any results, however shocking.”
