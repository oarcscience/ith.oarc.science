these arguments, our discussion with him will no <span id="page_478">p.

difficulty <span id="fr_1949"></span>[1951](#fn_1949.md) , since the truth
will be made manifest out of those doctrines on which he has been
brought up. For that there is a Word of God, and a Spirit of God, powers
essentially subsisting, both creative of whatever has come into being,
and comprehensive of things that exist, is shown in the clearest light
out of the Divinely-inspired Scriptures. It is enough if we call to mind
one testimony, and leave the discovery of more to those who are inclined
to take the trouble. “By the Word of the Lord,” it is said, “the heavens
were established, and all the power of them by the breath of His
mouth <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1952](#fn_1950.md) .” What word and what
breath? For the Word is not mere speech, nor that breath mere breathing.
Would not the Deity be brought down to the level of the likeness of our
human nature, were it held as a doctrine that the Maker of the universe
used such word and such breath as this? What power arising from speech
or breathing could there be of such a kind as would suffice for the
establishment of the heavens and the powers that are therein? For if the
Word of God is like our speech, and His Breath is like our breath, then
from these like things there must certainly come a likeness of power;
and the Word of God has just so much force as our word, and no more. But
the words that come from us and the breath that accompanies their
utterance are ineffective and unsubstantial. Thus, they who would bring
down the Deity to a similarity with the word as with us render also the
Divine word and spirit altogether ineffective and unsubstantial. But if,
as David says, “By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established,
and their powers had their framing by His breath,” then has the mystery
of the truth been confirmed, which instructs us to speak of a word as in
essential being, and a breath as in personality.
