<span id="viii.i.xi.i-Page_CCXI"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.i.xi.i-p1.1"></span>Book IX.</span>

<span id="viii.i.xi.i-p2"></span>§1. *The ninth book declares that
Eunomius’ account of the Nature of God is, up to a certain point, well
stated. Then in succession he mixes up with his own argument, on account
of its affinity, the expression from Philo’s writings, “God is before
all other things, which are generated,” adding also the expression, “He
has dominion over His own power.” Detesting the excessive absurdity,
Gregory strikingly confutes it* <span id="fr_904"></span>[906](#fn_904.md)

<span id="viii.i.xi.i-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="viii.i.xi.i-p4.1"></span>But</span> he now turns to loftier
language, and elevating himself and puffing himself up with empty
conceit, he takes in hand to say something worthy of God’s majesty. “For
God,” he says, “being the most highly exalted of all goods, and the
mightiest of all, and free from all necessity—” Nobly does the gallant
man bring his discourse, like some ship without ballast, driven unguided
by the waves of deceit, into the harbour of truth! “God is the most
highly exalted of all goods.” Splendid acknowledgment! I suppose he will
not bring a charge of unconstitutional conduct against the great John,
by whom, in his lofty proclamation, the Only-begotten is declared to be
God, Who was with God and was God <span
id="fr_905"></span>[907](#fn_905.md) . If he, then, the proclaimer of the
Godhead of the Only-begotten, is worthy of credit, and if “God is the
most highly exalted of all goods,” it follows that the Son is alleged by
the enemies of His glory, to be “the most highly exalted of all goods.”
And as this phrase is also applied to the Father, the superlative force
of “most highly exalted” admits of no diminution or addition by way of
comparison. But, now that we have obtained from the adversary’s
testimony these statements for the proof of the glory of the
Only-begotten, we must add in support of sound doctrine his next
statement too. He says, “God, the most highly exalted of all goods,
being without hindrance from nature, or constraint from cause, or
impulse from need, begets and creates according to the supremacy of His
own authority, having His will as power sufficient for the constitution
of the things produced. If, then, all good is according to His will, He
not only determines that which is made as good, but also the time of its
being good, if, that is to say, as one may assume, it is an indication
of weakness to make what one does not will <span
id="fr_906"></span>[908](#fn_906.md) .” We shall borrow so far as this, for
the confirmation of the orthodox doctrines, from our adversaries’
statement, percolated as that statement is by vile and counterfeit
clauses. Yes, He Who has, by the supremacy of His authority, power in
His will that suffices for the constitution of the things that are made,
He Who created all things without hindrance from nature or compulsion
from cause, does determine not only that which is made as good, but also
the time of its being good. But He Who made all things is, as the gospel
proclaims, the Only-begotten God. He, at that time when He willed it,
did make the creation; at that time, by means of the circumambient
essence, He surrounded with the body of heaven all that universe that is
shut off within its compass: at that time, when He thought it well that
this should be, He displayed the dry land to view, He enclosed the
waters in their hollow places; vegetation, fruits, the generation of
animals, the formation of man, appeared at that time when each of these
things seemed expedient to the wisdom of the Creator:—and He Who made
all these things (I will once more repeat my statement) is the
Only-begotten God Who made the ages. For if the interval of the ages has
preceded existing things, it is proper to employ the temporal adverb,
and to say “He *then* willed” and “He *then* made”: but since the age
was not, since no conception of interval is present to our minds in
regard to that Divine Nature which is not measured by quantity or by
interval, the force of temporal expressions must surely be void. Thus to
say that the creation has had given to it a beginning in time, according
to the good pleasure of the wisdom of Him Who made all things, does not
go beyond probability: but to regard the Divine Nature itself as being
in a kind of extension measured by intervals, belongs only to those who
have been trained in the new <span id="page_CCXII">p. CCXII</span> <span
id="viii.i.xi.i-Page_CCXII"></span>wisdom. What a point is this,
embedded in his words, which I intentionally passed by in my eagerness
to reach the subject! I will now resume it, and read it to show our
author’s cleverness.

<span id="viii.i.xi.i-p7"></span>“For He Who is most highly exalted in
God Himself <span id="fr_907"></span>[909](#fn_907.md) before all other
things that are generated,” he says, “has dominion over His own power.”
The phrase has been transferred by our pamphleteer word for word from
the Hebrew Philo to his own argument, and Eunomius’ theft will be proved
by Philo’s works themselves to any one who cares about it. I note the
fact, however, at present, not so much to reproach our speech-monger
with the poverty of his own arguments and thoughts, as with the
intention of showing to my readers the close relationship between the
doctrine of Eunomius and the reasoning of the Jews. For this phrase of
Philo would not have fitted word for word into his argument had there
not been a sort of kindred between the intention of the one and the
other. In the Hebrew author you may find the phrase in this form: “God,
before all other things that are generated”; and what follows, “has
dominion over His own power,” is an addition of the new Judaism. But
what an absurdity this involves an examination of the saying will
clearly show. “God,” he says, “has dominion over His own power.” Tell
me, what is He? over what has He dominion? Is He something else than His
own power, and Lord of a power that is something else than Himself? Then
power is overcome by the absence of power. For that which is something
else than power is surely not power, and thus He is found to have
dominion over power just in so far as He is not power. Or again, God,
being power, has another power in Himself, and has dominion over the one
by the other. And what contest or schism is there, that God should
divide the power that exists in Himself, and overthrow one section of
His power by the other. I suppose He could not have dominion over His
own power without the assistance to that end of some greater and more
violent power! Such is Eunomius’ God: a being with double nature, or
composite, dividing Himself against Himself, having one power out of
harmony with another, so that by one He is urged to disorder, and by the
other restrains this discordant motion. Again, with what intent does He
dominate the power that urges on to generation? lest some evil should
arise if generation be not hindered? or rather let him explain this in
the first place,—what is that which is naturally under dominion? His
language points to some movement of impulse and choice, considered
separately and independently. For that which dominates must needs be one
thing, that which is dominated another. Now God “has dominion over His
power”—and this is—what? a self-determining nature? or something else
than this, pressing on to disquiet, or remaining in a state of
quiescence? Well, if he supposes it to be quiescent, that which is
tranquil needs no one to have dominion over it: and if he says “He has
dominion,” He “has dominion” clearly over something which impels and is
in motion: and this, I presume he will say, is something naturally
different from Him Who rules it. What then, let him tell us, does he
understand in this idea? Is it something else besides God, considered as
having an independent existence? How can another existence be in God? Or
is it some condition in the Divine Nature considered as having an
existence not its own? I hardly think he would say so: for that which
has no existence of its own is not: and that which is not, is neither
under dominion, nor set free from it. What then is that power which was
under dominion, and was restrained in respect of its own activity, while
the due time of the generation of Christ was still about to come, and to
set this power free to proceed to its natural operation? What was the
intervening cause of delay, for which God deferred the generation of the
Only-begotten, not thinking it good as yet to become a Father? And what
is this that is inserted as intervening between the life of the Father
and that of the Son, that is not time nor space, nor any idea of
extension, nor any like thing? To what purpose is it that this keen and
clear-sighted eye marks and beholds the separation of the life of God in
regard to the life of the Son? When he is driven in all directions he is
himself forced to admit that the interval does not exist at all.

<span id="viii.i.xi.i-p3"></span> This section of the analysis is so
confused that it cannot well be literally translated. In the version
given above the general sense rather than the precise grammatical
construction has been followed.

<span id="viii.i.xi.i-p8"></span> This seems to be the force of the
phrase if we are to follow Oehler’s <span class="c22"><span
id="viii.i.xi.i-p8.1"></span>mss.</span> and read <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.xi.i-p8.2"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.i.xi.i-p8.3"></span>γὰρ ἐξοχώτατος αὐτοῦ
θεοῦ</span>. The <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.xi.i-p8.4"></span>αὐτὸς θεὸς</span> of the earlier editions
gives a simpler sense. The phrase as read by Oehler certainly savours
more of Philo than of Eunomius: but it is worth noting that S. Gregory
does not dwell upon this part of the clause as being borrowed from Philo
(though he may intend to include it in the general statement), but upon
what follows it: and from his citation from Philo it would seem that the
latter spoke (not of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.xi.i-p8.5"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.i.xi.i-p8.6"></span>ἐξοχώτατος θεοῦ</span> but) of <span

[Next: He then ingeniously shows that the generation of the Son is not
according to the phrase of Eunomius, “The Father begat Him at that time
when He chose, and not before:” but that the Son, being the fulness of
all that is good and excellent, is always contemplated in the Father;
using for this demonstration the support of Eunomius' own
arguments.](2050118.md)
