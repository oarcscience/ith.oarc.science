<span id="viii.i.iii.xii"></span>

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p1"></span> §12. *His charge of cowardice is
baseless: for Basil displayed the highest courage before the Emperor and
his Lord-Lieutenants.*

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p2"></span>He treats our words so; and in the
rest of his presumptuous statements can there be shown to be a particle
of truth? In these he calls him ‘cowardly,’ ‘spiritless,’ ‘a shirker of
severer labours,’ exhausting the list of such terms, and giving with
laboured circumstantiality every symptom of this cowardice: ‘the retired
cabin, the door firmly closed, the anxious fear of intruders, the voice,
the look, the tell-tale change of countenance,’ everything of that sort,
whereby the passion of fear is shown. If he were detected in no other
lie but this, it alone would be sufficient to reveal his bent. For who
does not know how, during the time when the Emperor Valens was roused
against the churches of the Lord, that mighty champion of ours rose by
his lofty spirit superior to those overwhelming circumstances and the
terrors of the foe, and showed a mind which soared above every means
devised to daunt him? Who of the dwellers in the East, and of the
furthest regions of our civilized world did not hear of his combat with
the throne itself for the truth? Who, looking to his antagonist, was not
in dismay? For his was no common antagonist, possessed only of the power
of winning in sophistic juggles, where victory is no glory and defeat is
harmless; but he had the power of bending the whole Roman government to
his will; and, added to this pride of empire, he had prejudices against
our faith, cunningly instilled into his mind by Eudoxius <span
id="fr_96"></span>[98](#fn_96.md) of Germanicia <span
id="fr_97"></span>[99](#fn_97.md) , who had won him to his side; and he
found in all those who were then at the head of affairs allies in
carrying out his designs, some being already inclined to them from
mental sympathies, while others, and they were the majority, were ready
from fear to indulge the imperial pleasure, and seeing the severity
employed against those who held to the Faith were ostentatious in their
zeal for him. It was a time of exile, confiscation, banishment, threats
of fines, danger of life, arrests, imprisonment, scourging; nothing was
too dreadful to put in force against those who would not yield to this
sudden caprice of the Emperor; it was worse for the faithful to be
caught in God’s house than if they had been detected in the most heinous
of crimes.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p5"></span>But a detailed history of that time
would be too long; and would require a separate treatment; besides, as
the sufferings at that sad season are known to all, nothing would be
gained for our present purpose by carefully setting them forth in
writing. A second drawback to such an attempt would be found to be that
amidst the details of that melancholy history we should be forced to
make mention <span id="page_XLVIII">p. XLVIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xii-Page_XLVIII"></span>of ourselves; and if we did
anything in those struggles for our religion that redounds to our honour
in the telling, Wisdom commands us to leave it to others to tell. “Let
another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth <span
id="fr_98"></span>[100](#fn_98.md) ;” and it is this very thing that our
omniscient friend has not been conscious of in devoting the larger half
of his book to self-glorification.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p7"></span>Omitting, then, all that kind of
detail, I will be careful only in setting forth the achievement of our
Master. The adversary whom he had to combat was no less a person than
the Emperor himself; that adversary’s second was the man who stood next
him in the government; his assistants to work out his will were the
court. Let us take into consideration also the point of time, in order
to test and to illustrate the fortitude of our own noble champion. When
was it? The Emperor was proceeding from Constantinople to the East
elated by his recent successes against the barbarians, and not in a
spirit to brook any obstruction to his will; and his lord-lieutenant
directed his route, postponing all administration of the necessary
affairs of state as long as a home remained to one adherent of the
Faith, and until every one, no matter where, was ejected, and others,
chosen by himself to outrage our godly hierarchy, were introduced
instead. The Powers then of the Propontis were moving in such a fury,
like some dark cloud, upon the churches; Bithynia was completely
devastated; Galatia was very quickly carried away by their stream; all
in the intervening districts had succeeded with them; and now our fold
lay the next to be attacked. What did our mighty Basil show like then,
‘that spiritless coward,’ as Eunomius calls him, ‘shrinking from danger,
and trusting to a retired cabin to save him?’ Did he quail at this evil
onset? Did he allow the sufferings of previous victims to suggest to him
that he should secure his own safety? Did he listen to any who advised a
slight yielding to this rush of evils <span
id="fr_99"></span>[101](#fn_99.md) , so as not to throw himself openly in
the path of men who were now veterans in slaughter? Rather we find that
all excess of language, all height of thought and word, falls short of
the truth about him. None could describe his contempt of danger, so as
to bring before the reader’s eyes this new combat, which one might
justly say was waged not between man and man, but between a Christian’s
firmness and courage on the one side, and a bloodstained power on the
other.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p9"></span>The lord-lieutenant kept appealing
to the commands of the Emperor, and rendering a power, which from its
enormous strength was terrible enough, more terrible still by the
unsparing cruelty of its vengeance. After the tragedies which he had
enacted in Bithynia, and after Galatia with characteristic fickleness
had yielded without a struggle, he thought that our country would fall a
ready prey to his designs. Cruel deeds were preluded by words proposing,
with mingled threats and promises, royal favours and ecclesiastical
power to obedience, but to resistance all that a cruel spirit which has
got the power to work its will can devise. Such was the enemy.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p10"></span>So far was our champion from being
daunted by what he saw and heard, that he acted rather like a physician
or prudent councillor called in to correct something that was wrong,
bidding them repent of their rashness and cease to commit murders
amongst the servants of the Lord; ‘their plans,’ he said, ‘could not
succeed with men who cared only for the empire of Christ, and for the
Powers that never die; with all their wish to maltreat him, they could
discover nothing, whether word or act, that could pain the Christian;
confiscation could not touch him whose only possession was his Faith;
exile had no terrors for one who walked in every land with the same
feelings, and looked on every city as strange because of the shortness
of his sojourn in it, yet as home, because all human creatures are in
equal bondage with himself; the endurance of blows, or tortures, or
death, if it might be for the Truth, was an object of fear not even to
women, but to every Christian it was the supremest bliss to suffer the
worst for this their hope, and they were only grieved that nature
allowed them but one death, and that they could devise no means of dying
many times in this battle for the Truth <span
id="fr_100"></span>[102](#fn_100.md) .’

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p12"></span>When he thus confronted their
threats, and looked beyond that imposing power, as if it were all
nothing, then their exasperation, just like those rapid changes on the
stage when one mask after another is put on, turned with all its threats
into flattery; and the very man whose spirit up to then had been so
determined and formidable adopted the most gentle and submissive of
language; ‘Do not, I beg you, think it a small thing for our mighty
emperor to have communion with your people, but be willing to be called
his master too: nor thwart his wish; he wishes for this peace, if only
one little word in the written Creed is erased, that of Homoousios.’ Our
master answers that it is of the greatest importance that the emperor
<span id="page_XLIX">p. XLIX</span> <span
id="viii.i.iii.xii-Page_XLIX"></span>should be a member of the Church;
that is, that he should save his soul, not as an emperor, but as a mere
man; but a diminution of or addition to the Faith was so far from his
(Basil’s) thoughts, that he would not change even the order of the
written words. That was what this ‘spiritless coward, who trembles at
the creaking of a door,’ said to this great ruler, and he confirmed his
words by what he did; for he stemmed in his own person this imperial
torrent of ruin that was rushing on the churches, and turned it aside;
he in himself was a match for this attack, like a grand immoveable rock
in the sea, breaking the huge and surging billow of that terrible onset.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p13"></span>Nor did his wrestling stop there;
the emperor himself succeeds to the attack, exasperated because he did
not get effected in the first attempt all that he wished. Just,
accordingly, as the Assyrian effected the destruction of the temple of
the Israelites at Jerusalem by means of the cook Nabuzardan, so did this
monarch of ours entrust his business to one Demosthenes, comptroller of
his kitchen, and chief of his cooks <span
id="fr_101"></span>[103](#fn_101.md) , as to one more pushing than the
rest, thinking thereby to succeed entirely in his design. With this man
stirring the pot, and with one of the blasphemers from Illyricum,
letters in hand, assembling the authorities with this end in view, and
with Modestus <span id="fr_102"></span>[104](#fn_102.md) kindling passion
to a greater heat than in the previous excitement, every one joined the
movement of the Emperor’s anger, making his fury their own, and yielding
to the temper of authority; and on the other hand all felt their hopes
sink at the prospect of what might happen. That same lord-lieutenant
re-enters on the scene; intimidations worse than the former are begun;
their threats are thrown out; their anger rises to a still higher pitch;
there is the tragic pomp of trial over again, the criers, the
apparitors, the lictors, the curtained bar, things which naturally daunt
even a mind which is thoroughly prepared; and again we see God’s
champion amidst this combat surpassing even his former glory. If you
want proofs, look at the facts. What spot, where there are churches, did
not that disaster reach? What nation remained unreached by these
heretical commands? Who of the illustrious in any Church was not driven
from the scene of his labours? What people escaped their despiteful
treatment? It reached all Syria, and Mesopotamia up to the frontier,
Phœnicia, Palestine, Arabia, Egypt, the Libyan tribes to the boundaries
of the civilized world; and all nearer home, Pontus, Cilicia, Lycia,
Lydia, Pisidia, Pamphylia, Caria, the Hellespont, the islands up to the
Propontis itself; the coasts of Thrace, as far as Thrace extends, and
the bordering nations as far as the Danube. Which of these countries
retained its former look, unless any were already possessed with the
evil? The people of Cappadocia alone felt not these afflictions of the
Church, because our mighty champion saved them in their trial.

<span id="viii.i.iii.xii-p16"></span>Such was the achievement of this
‘coward’ master of ours; such was the success of one who ‘shirks all
sterner toil.’ Surely it is not that of one who ‘wins renown amongst
poor old women, and practises to deceive the sex which naturally falls
into every snare,’ and ‘thinks it a great thing to be admired by the
criminal and abandoned;’ it is that of one who has proved by deeds his
soul’s fortitude, and the unflinching and noble manliness of his spirit.
His success has resulted in the salvation of the whole country, the
peace of our Church, the pattern given to the virtuous of every
excellence, the overthrow of the foe, the upholding of the Faith, the
confirmation of the weaker brethren, the encouragement of the zealous,
everything that is believed to belong to the victorious side; and in the
commemoration of no other events but these do hearing and seeing unite
in accomplished facts; for here it is one and the same thing to relate
in words his noble deeds and to show in facts the attestation of our
words, and to confirm each by the other—the record from what is before
our eyes, and the facts from what is being said.

Nabuzardan by Gregory Naz. also (Orat. xliii. 47). Cf. also Theodoret,
iv. 19, where most of these events are recorded. The former says that
‘Nabuzardan threatened Basil when summoned before him with the <span
