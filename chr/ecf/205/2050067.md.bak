<span id="viii.i.iv.viii-p1"></span> §8. *He further very appositely
expounds the meaning of the term “Only-Begotten,” and of the term “First
born,” four times used by the Apostle.*

<span id="viii.i.iv.viii-p2"></span>The mighty Paul, knowing that the
Only-begotten God, Who has the pre-eminence in all things <span
id="fr_325"></span>[327](#fn_325.md) , is the author and cause of all good,
bears witness to Him that not only was the creation of all existent
things wrought by Him, but that when the original creation of man had
decayed and vanished away <span id="fr_326"></span>[328](#fn_326.md) , to
use his own language, and another new creation was wrought in Christ, in
this too no other than He took the lead, but He is Himself the
first-born of all that new creation of men which is effected by the
Gospel. And that our view about this may be made clearer let us thus
divide our argument. The inspired apostle on four occasions employs this
term, once as here, calling Him, “first-born of all creation <span
id="fr_327"></span>[329](#fn_327.md) ,” another time, “the first-born among
many brethren <span id="fr_328"></span>[330](#fn_328.md) ,” again,
“first-born from the dead <span id="fr_329"></span>[331](#fn_329.md) ,” and
on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it
with other words, saying, “But when again He bringeth the first-born
into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship
Him <span id="fr_330"></span>[332](#fn_330.md) .” Accordingly whatever view
we entertain concerning this title in the other combinations, the same
we shall in consistency apply to the phrase “first-born of all
creation.” For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that
the meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become “the
first-born among many brethren?” in what sense does He become “the
first-born from the dead?” Assuredly this is plain, that because we are
by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, “He Who for our sakes
was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood <span
id="fr_331"></span>[333](#fn_331.md) ,” purposing to change us from
corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water
and the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the
water, by His own baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He
became the first-born of those who are spiritually born again, and gave
the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like to His own by
water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should <span
id="page_CXIII">p. CXIII</span> <span
id="viii.i.iv.viii-Page_CXIII"></span>implant in our nature the power of
rising again from the dead, He becomes the “first-fruits of them that
slept <span id="fr_332"></span>[334](#fn_332.md) ” and the “first-born from
the dead <span id="fr_333"></span>[335](#fn_333.md) ,” in that He first by
His own act loosed the pains of death <span
id="fr_334"></span>[336](#fn_334.md) , so that His new birth from the dead
was made a way for us also, since the pains of death, wherein we were
held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus, just as by
having shared in the washing of regeneration <span
id="fr_335"></span>[337](#fn_335.md) He became “the first-born among many
brethren,” and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the
resurrection, He obtains the name of the “first-born from the dead,” so
having in all things the pre-eminence, after that “all old things,” as
the apostle says, “have passed away <span
id="fr_336"></span>[338](#fn_336.md) ,” He becomes the first-born of the
new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that
by Holy Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection
from the dead, becoming for us in both alike the Prince of Life <span
id="fr_337"></span>[339](#fn_337.md) , the first-fruits, the first-born.
This first-born, then, hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to
Mary, saying, “Go and tell My brethren, I go to My Father and your
Father, and to My God and your God <span
id="fr_338"></span>[340](#fn_338.md) .” In these words He sums up the whole
aim of His dispensation as Man. For men revolted from God, and “served
them which by nature were no gods <span
id="fr_339"></span>[341](#fn_339.md) ,” and though being the children of
God became attached to an evil father falsely so called. For this cause
the mediator between God and man <span id="fr_340"></span>[342](#fn_340.md)
having assumed the first-fruits of all human nature <span
id="fr_341"></span>[343](#fn_341.md) , sends to His brethren the
announcement of Himself not in His divine character, but in that which
He shares with us, saying, “I am departing in order to make by My own
self that true Father, from whom you were separated, to be your Father,
and by My own self to make that true God from whom you had revolted to
be your God, for by that first-fruits which I have assumed, I am in
Myself presenting all humanity to its God and Father.”

<span id="viii.i.iv.viii-p20"></span>Since, then, the first-fruits made
the true God to be its God, and the good Father to be its Father, the
blessing is secured for human nature as a whole, and by means of the
first-fruits the true God and Father becomes Father and God of all men.
Now “if the first-fruits be holy, the lump also is holy <span
id="fr_342"></span>[344](#fn_342.md) .” But where the first-fruits, Christ,
is (and the first-fruits is none other than Christ), there also are they
that are Christ’s, as the apostle says. In those passages therefore
where he makes mention of the “first-born” in connexion with other
words, he suggests that we should understand the phrase in the way which
I have indicated: but where, without any such addition, he says, “When
again He bringeth the first-born into the world <span
id="fr_343"></span>[345](#fn_343.md) ,” the addition of “again” asserts
that manifestation of the Lord of all which shall take place at the last
day. For as “at the name of Jesus every knee doth bow, of things in
heaven and things in earth and things under the earth <span
id="fr_344"></span>[346](#fn_344.md) ,” although the human name does not
belong to the Son in that He is above every name, even so He says that
the First-born, Who was so named for our sakes, is worshipped by all the
supramundane creation, on His coming again into the world, when He
“shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with
equity <span id="fr_345"></span>[347](#fn_345.md) .” Thus the several
meanings of the titles “First-born” and “Only begotten” are kept
distinct by the word of godliness, its respective significance being
secured for each name. But how can he who refers the name of
“first-born” to the pre-temporal existence of the Son preserve the
proper sense of the term “Only-begotten”? Let the discerning reader
consider whether these things agree with one another, when the term
“first-born” necessarily implies brethren, and the term “Only-begotten”
as necessarily excludes the notion of brethren. For when the Scripture
says, “In the beginning was the Word <span
id="fr_346"></span>[348](#fn_346.md) ,” we understand the Only-begotten to
be meant, and when it adds “the Word was made flesh <span
id="fr_347"></span>[349](#fn_347.md) ” we thereby receive in our minds the
idea of the first-born, and so the word of godliness remains without
confusion, preserving to each name its natural significance, so that in
“Only-begotten” we regard the pre-temporal, and by “the first-born of
creation” the manifestation of the pre-temporal in the flesh.
