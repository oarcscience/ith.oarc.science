<span id="xiii.ii-p6"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xiii.ii-p6.1"></span>When</span> the length of the day begins to
expand in winter-time, as the sun mounts to the upper part of his
course, we keep the feast of the appearing of the true Light divine,
that through the veil of flesh has cast its bright beams upon the life
of men: but now when that luminary has traversed half the heaven in his
course, so that night and day are of equal length, the upward return of
human nature from death to life is the theme of this great and universal
festival, which all the life of those who have embraced the mystery of
the Resurrection unites in celebrating. What is the meaning of the
subject thus suggested for my letter to you? Why, since it is the custom
in these general holidays for us to take every way to show the affection
harboured in our hearts, and some, as you know, give proof of their good
will by presents of their own, we thought it only right not to leave you
without the homage of our gifts, but to lay before your lofty and
high-minded soul the scanty offerings of our poverty. Now our offering
which is tendered for your acceptance in this letter is the letter
itself, in which there is not a single word wreathed with the flowers of
rhetoric or adorned with the graces of composition, to make it to be
deemed a gift at all in literary circles, but the mystical gold, which
is wrapped up in the faith of Christians, as in a packet <span
id="fr_2161"></span>[2163](#fn_2161.md) , must be my present to you, after
being unwrapped, as far as possible, by these lines, and showing its
hidden brilliancy. Accordingly we must return to our prelude. Why is it
that then only, when the night has attained its utmost length, so that
no further addition is possible, that He appears in flesh to us, Who
holds the Universe in His grasp, and controls the same Universe by His
own power, Who cannot be contained even by all intelligible things, but
includes the whole, even at the time that He enters the narrow dwelling
of a fleshly tabernacle, while His mighty power thus keeps pace with His
beneficent purpose, and shows itself even as a shadow wherever the will
inclines, so that neither in the creation of the world was the power
found weaker than the will, nor when He was eager to stoop down to the
lowliness of our mortal nature did He lack power to that very end, but
actually did come to be in that condition, yet without leaving the
universe unpiloted <span id="fr_2162"></span>[2164](#fn_2162.md) ? Since,
then, there is some account to be given of both those seasons, how it is
that it is winter-time when He appears in the flesh, but it is when the
days are as long as the nights that He restores to life man, who because
of his sins returned to the earth from whence he came,—by explaining the
reason of this, as well as I can in few words, I will make my letter my
present to you. Has your own sagacity, as of course it has, already
divined the mystery hinted at by these coincidences; that the advance of
night is stopped by the accessions to the light, and the period of
darkness begins to be shortened, as the length of the day is increased
by the successive additions? For thus much perhaps would be plain enough
even to the uninitiated, that sin is near akin to darkness; and in fact
evil is so termed by the Scripture. Accordingly the season in which our
mystery of godliness begins is a kind of exposition of the Divine
dispensation on behalf of our souls. For meet and right it was that,
when vice was shed abroad <span id="fr_2163"></span>[2165](#fn_2163.md)
without bounds, \[upon this night of evil the Sun of righteousness
should rise, and <span id="page_528">p. 528</span> <span
id="xiii.ii-Page_528"></span>that in us who have before walked in
darkness <span id="fr_2164"></span>[2166](#fn_2164.md) \] the day which we
receive from Him Who placed that light in our hearts should increase
more and more; so that the life which is in the light should be extended
to the greatest length possible, being constantly augmented by additions
of good; and that the life in vice should by gradual subtraction be
reduced to the smallest possible compass; for the increase of things
good comes to the same thing as the diminution of things evil. But the
feast of the Resurrection; occurring when the days are of equal length,
of itself gives us this interpretation of the coincidence, namely, that
we shall no longer fight with evils only upon equal terms, vice
grappling with virtue in indecisive strife, but that the life of light
will prevail, the gloom of idolatry melting as the day waxes stronger.
For this reason also, after the moon has run her course for fourteen
days, Easter exhibits her exactly opposite to the rays of the sun, full
with all the wealth of his brightness, and not permitting any interval
of darkness to take place in its turn <span
id="fr_2165"></span>[2167](#fn_2165.md) : for, after taking the place of
the sun at its setting, she does not herself set before she mingles her
own beams with the genuine rays of the sun, so that one light remains
continuously, throughout the whole space of the earth’s course by day
and night, without any break whatsoever being caused by the
interposition of darkness. This discussion, dear one, we contribute by
way of a gift from our poor and needy hand; and may your whole life be a
continual festival and a high day, never dimmed by a single stain of
nightly gloom.

<span id="fn_2159"></span>[527:2161](2050267.htm#fr_2159.md) <span
id="xiii.ii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p2"></span> The first fourteen of these Letters have
been once edited; *i.e.* by Zacagni (Rome, 1698), from the Vatican <span
class="c22"><span id="xiii.ii-p2.1"></span>ms</span>. See *Prolegomena*,
p. 30. They are found also in the Medicean <span class="c22"><span
id="xiii.ii-p2.2"></span>ms</span>., of which Bandinus gives an accurate
account, and which is much superior, on the authority of Caraccioli, who
saw both, to the Vatican. Zacagni did not see the Medicean: but many of
his felicitous emendations of the Vatican lacunæ correspond with it.
They are here translated by the late Reverend Harman Chaloner Ogle,
Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford (Ireland Scholar), who died suddenly
(1887), to the grief of very many, and the irreparable loss to
scholarship, on the eve of his departure to aid the Mission of the
Archbishop of Canterbury to the Armenian Church. The notes added by him
are signed with his initials.

<span id="xiii.ii-p5"></span> Sent as an Easter present to Eusebius,
bishop of Chalcis, in Cœle-Syria, a staunch Catholic, who attended the
Council of Constantinople. For this custom amongst the Eastern
Christians of exchanging presents at the great festivals, cf. *On the
Making of Man* (p. 387), which Gregory sent to his brother Peter:
Gregory Naz. *Letter* 54 *to Helladius*, and *Letter* 87 *to Theodore of
Tyana*.

<span id="xiii.ii-p8"></span> Evidently an allusion to the myth in
Plato.

<span id="fn_2163"></span>[527:2165](2050267.htm#fr_2163.md) <span
id="xiii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p9"></span> The <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ii-p9.1"></span>χύσις τῆς κακίας</span> is a frequent
expression in Origen.

<span id="fn_2164"></span>[528:2166](2050267.htm#fr_2164.md) <span
id="xiii.ii-p9.2"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p10"></span> A corrupt passage. Probably some lines
have been lost. A double opposition seems intended; (1) between the
night of evil and our Saviour’s coming like the Sun to disperse it; and
(2) between walking in darkness and walking in light on the part of the
individual (H. C. O.).

<span id="fn_2165"></span>[528:2167](2050267.htm#fr_2165.md) <span

<span id="xiii.ii-p11"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ii-p11.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ii-p11.2"></span>ν τῷ μέρει</span>, or “on her part” or “at
that particular season.” To support this last, [Col. ii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p11.3"></span>,
<span class="Greek"><span id="xiii.ii-p11.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xiii.ii-p11.5"></span>ν μέρει ἑορτῆς</span>, may
be compared, as Origen interprets it, “in a particular feast,” *c.
Cels.* viii. 23: “Paul alludes to this, when he names the feast selected
in preference to others only ‘part of a feast,’ hinting that the life
everlasting with the Word of God is not ‘in the part of a feast, but in
a complete and continuous one.’ Modern commentators on that passage, it
is true, interpret <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ii-p11.6"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.ii-p11.7"></span>ν μέρει</span> “with regard to,” “on the score
of.” But has Origen’s meaning been sufficiently considered?
