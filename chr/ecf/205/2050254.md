<span id="xi.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.</span>

<span id="xi.ii.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="xi.ii.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> they ask for proof of this
presence of the Deity when invoked for the sanctification of the
baptismal process <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2022](#fn_2020) . Let the
person who requires this evidence recall to mind the result of our
inquiries further back. The reasoning by which we established that the
power which was manifested to us through the flesh was really a Divine
power, is the defence of that which we now say. For when it has been
shown that He Who was manifested in the flesh, and then exhibited His
nature by the miracles which He wrought, was God, it is also at the same
time shown that He is present in that process, as often as He is
invoked. For, as of everything that exists there is some peculiarity
which indicates its nature, so truth is the distinctive peculiarity of
the Divine nature. Well, then, He has promised that He will always be
present with those that call upon Him, that He is in the midst of those
that believe, that He remains among them collectively and has special
intercourse with each one. We can no longer, then, need any other proof
of the presence of the Deity in the things that are done in Baptism,
believing as we do that He is God by reason of the miracles which He
wrought, and knowing as we do that it is the peculiarity of the Godhead
to be free from any touch of falsehood, and confidently holding as we do
that the thing promised was involved in the truthfulness of its
announcement. The invocation by prayer, then, which precedes this Divine
Dispensation constitutes an abundance of proof that what is effected is
done by God. For if in the case of that other kind of man-formation the
impulses of the parents, even though they <span id="page_502">p.
502</span> <span id="xi.ii.xxxvi-Page_502"></span>do not invoke the
Deity, yet by the power of God, as we have before said, mould the
embryo, and if this power is withheld their eagerness is ineffectual and
useless, how much more will the object be accomplished in that spiritual
mode of generation, where both God has promised that He will be present
in the process and, as we have believed, has put power from Himself into
the work, and, besides, our own will is bent upon that object;
supposing, that is, that the aid which comes through prayer has at the
same time been duly called in? For as they who pray God that the sun may
shine on them in no way blunt the promptitude of that which is actually
going to take place, yet no one will say that the zeal of those who thus
pray is useless on the ground that they pray God for what must happen,
in the same way they who, resting on the truthfulness of His promise,
are firmly persuaded that His grace is surely present in those who are
regenerate in this mystical Dispensation, either themselves make <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[2023](#fn_2021) an actual addition to that grace,
or at all events do not cause the existing grace to miscarry. For that
the grace is there is a matter of faith, on account of Him Who has
promised to give it being Divine; while the testimony as to His Divinity
comes through the Miracles <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2024](#fn_2022) .
Thus, then, that the Deity is present in all the baptismal process <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2025](#fn_2023) admits of no question.
