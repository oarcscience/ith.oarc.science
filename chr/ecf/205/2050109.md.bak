<span id="viii.i.ix.v"></span>

<span id="viii.i.ix.v-p1"></span> §5. *After much discourse concerning
the actually existent, and ungenerate and good, and upon the
consubstantiality of the heavenly powers, showing the uncharted
character of their essence, yet the difference of their ranks, he ends
the book.*

<span id="viii.i.ix.v-p2"></span>Now in saying these things we do not
intend to deny that the Father exists without generation, and we have no
intention of refusing to agree to the statement that the Only-begotten
God is generated;—on the contrary the latter has been generated, the
former has not been generated. But what He *is,* in His own Nature, Who
exists apart from generation, and what He *is,* Who is believed to have
been generated, we do not learn from the signification of “having been
generated,” and “not having been generated.” For when we say “this
person was generated” (or “was not generated”), we are impressed with a
two-fold thought, having our eyes turned to the subject by the
demonstrative part of the phrase, and learning that which is
contemplated in the subject by the words “was generated” or “was not
generated,”—as it is one thing to think of that which is, and another to
think of what we contemplate in that which is. But, moreover, the word
“*is*” is surely understood with every name that is used concerning the
Divine Nature,—as “just,” “incorruptible,” “immortal,” and “ungenerate,”
and whatever else is said of Him; even if this word does not happen to
occur in the phrase, yet the thought both of the speaker and the hearer
surely makes the name attach to “*is,*” so that if this word were not
added, the appellation would be uttered in vain. For instance (for it is
better to present an argument by way of illustration), when David says,
“God, a righteous judge, strong and patient <span
id="fr_841"></span>[843](#fn_841.md) ,” if “is” were not understood with
each of the epithets included in the phrase, the enumerations of the
appellations will seem purposeless and unreal, not having any subject to
rest upon; but when “is” is understood with each of the names, what is
said will clearly be of force, being contemplated in reference to that
which is. As, then, when we say “He is a judge,” we conceive concerning
Him some operation of judgment, and by the “is” carry our minds to the
subject, and are hereby clearly taught not to suppose that the account
of His being is the same with the action, so also as a result of saying,
“He is generated (or ungenerate),” we divide our thought into a double
conception, by “is” understanding the subject, and by “generated,” or
“ungenerate,” apprehending that which belongs to the subject. As, then,
when we are taught by David that God is “a judge,” or “patient,” we do
not learn the Divine essence, but one of the attributes which are
contemplated in it, so in this case too when we hear of His being not
generated, we do not by this negative predication understand the
*subject,* but are guided as to what we must not think concerning the
subject, while what He essentially is remains as much as ever
unexplained. So too, when Holy Scripture predicates the other Divine
names of Him Who is, and delivers to Moses the Being without a name, it
is for him who discloses the Nature of that Being, not to rehearse the
attributes of the Being, but by his words to make manifest to us its
actual Nature. For every name which you may use is an attribute of the
Being, but is not the Being,—“good,” “ungenerate,” “incorruptible,”—but
to each of these “is” does not fail to be supplied. Any one, then, who
undertakes to give the account of this good Being, of this ungenerate
Being, as He is, would speak in vain, if he rehearsed the attributes
contemplated in Him, and were silent as to that essence which he
undertakes by his <span id="page_CXCIX">p. CXCIX</span> <span
id="viii.i.ix.v-Page_CXCIX"></span>words to explain. To be *without
generation* is one of the attributes contemplated in the Being, but the
definition of “Being” is one thing, and that of “being in some
particular way” is another; and this <span
id="fr_842"></span>[844](#fn_842.md) has so far remained untold and
unexplained by the passages cited. Let him then first disclose to us the
names of the essence, and then divide the Nature by the divergence of
the appellations;—so long as what we require remains unexplained, it is
in vain that he employs his scientific skill upon names, seeing that the
names <span id="fr_843"></span>[845](#fn_843.md) have no separate
existence.

<span id="viii.i.ix.v-p6"></span>Such then is Eunomius’ stronger handle
against the truth, while we pass by in silence many views which are to
be found in this part of his composition; for it seems to me right that
those who run in this armed race <span id="fr_844"></span>[846](#fn_844.md)
against the enemies of the truth should arm themselves against those who
are fairly fenced about with the plausibility of falsehood, and not
defile their argument with such conceptions as are already dead and of
offensive odour. His supposition that whatever things are united in the
idea of their essence <span id="fr_845"></span>[847](#fn_845.md) must needs
exist corporeally and be joined to corruption (for this he says in this
part of his work), I shall willingly pass by like some cadaverous odour,
since I think every reasonable man will perceive how dead and corrupt
such an argument is. For who knows not that the multitude of human souls
is countless, yet one essence underlies them all, and the consubstantial
substratum in them is alien from bodily corruption? so that even
children can plainly see the argument that bodies are corrupted and
dissolved, not because they have the same essence one with another, but
because of their possessing a compound nature. The idea of the compound
nature is one, that of the common nature of their essence is another, so
that it is true to say, “corruptible bodies are of one essence,” but the
converse statement is not true at all, if it be anything like, “this
consubstantial nature is also surely corruptible,” as is shown in the
case of the souls which have one essence, while yet corruption does not
attach to them in virtue of the community of essence. And the account
given of the souls might properly be applied to every intellectual
existence which we contemplate in creation. For the words brought
together by Paul do not signify, as Eunomius will have them do, some
mutually divergent natures of the supra-mundane powers; on the contrary,
the sense of the names clearly indicates that he is mentioning in his
argument, not diversities of *natures,* but the varied peculiarities of
the *operations* of the heavenly host: for there are, he says,
“principalities,” and “thrones,” and “powers,” and “mights,” and
“dominions <span id="fr_846"></span>[848](#fn_846.md) .” Now these names
are such as to make it at once clear to every one that their
significance is arranged in regard to some operation. For to rule, and
to exercise power and dominion, and to be the throne of some one,—all
these conceptions would not be held by any one versed in argument to
apply to diversities of *essence,* since it is clearly *operation* that
is signified by every one of the names: so that any one who says that
diversities of *nature* are signified by the names rehearsed by Paul
deceives himself, “understanding,” as the Apostle says, “neither what he
says, nor whereof he affirms <span id="fr_847"></span>[849](#fn_847.md) ,”
since the sense of the names clearly shows that the Apostle recognizes
in the intelligible powers distinctions of certain ranks, but does not
by these names indicate varieties of essences.

<span id="viii.i.ix.v-p4"></span> What “this” means is not clear: it may
be “the Being,” but most probably is the distinction which S. Gregory is
pointing out between the Being and Its attributes, which he considers
has not been sufficiently recognized.

mind something of the same idea of *corporeal* existence attaching to it
which has been made to attach to the Latin “substantia,” and to the
