id="ix.ii.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.</span>

<span id="ix.ii.ii.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ix.ii.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> holy look of virginity is
precious indeed in the judgment of all who make purity the test of
beauty; but it belongs to those alone whose struggles to gain this
object of a noble love are favoured and helped by the grace of God. Its
praise is heard at once in the very name which goes with it;
“Uncorrupted <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1346](#fn_1344.md) ” is the word
<span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="ix.ii.ii.ii-Page_344"></span>commonly said of it, and this shows the
kind of purity that is in it; thus we can measure by its equivalent term
the height of this gift, seeing that amongst the many results of
virtuous endeavour this alone has been honoured with the title of the
thing that is uncorrupted. And if we must extol with laudations this
gift from the great God, the words of His Apostle are sufficient in its
praise; they are few, but they throw into the background all extravagant
laudations; he only styles as “holy and without blemish <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[1347](#fn_1345.md) ” her who has this grace for her
ornament. Now if the achievement of this saintly virtue consists in
making one “without blemish and holy,” and these epithets are adopted in
their first and fullest force to glorify the incorruptible Deity, what
greater praise of virginity can there be than thus to be shown in a
manner *deifying* those who share in her pure mysteries, so that they
become partakers of His glory Who is in actual truth the only Holy and
Blameless One; their purity and their incorruptibility being the means
of bringing them into relationship with Him? Many who write lengthy
laudations in detailed treatises, with the view of adding something to
the wonder of this grace, unconsciously defeat, in my opinion, their own
end; the fulsome manner in which they amplify their subject brings its
credit into suspicion. Nature’s greatnesses have their own way of
striking with admiration; they do not need the pleading of words: the
sky, for instance, or the sun, or any other wonder of the universe. In
the business of this lower world words certainly act as a basement, and
the skill of praise does impart a look of magnificence; so much so, that
mankind are apt to suspect as the result of mere art the wonder produced
by panegyric. So the one sufficient way of praising virginity will be to
show that that virtue is above praise, and to evince our admiration of
it by our lives rather than by our words. A man who takes this theme for
ambitious praise has the appearance of supposing that one drop of his
own perspiration will make an appreciable increase of the boundless
ocean, if indeed he believes, as he does, that any human words can give
more dignity to so rare a grace; he must be ignorant either of his own
powers or of that which he attempts to praise.

meaning of this latter word at the close of the Epistle to the

class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.ii.ii-p3.5"></span>γαπώντων</span>, “in a

(“in uncorruptness” R.V.): although in the six other passages where it
occurs in S. Paul “it refers directly or indirectly to a higher sphere
than the present.” *i.e.* of immortality above, and might so, if the
construction allowed, be taken with <span class="Greek"><span

use of <span class="Greek"><span
