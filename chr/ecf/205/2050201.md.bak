<span id="x.ii.ii.xx"></span>

<span id="x.ii.ii.xx-p1"></span> XIX. *To those who say that the
enjoyment of the good things we look for will again consist in meat and
drink, because it is written that by these means man at first lived in
Paradise* <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1670](#fn_1668.md) .

<span id="x.ii.ii.xx-p3"></span>1. But some one perhaps will say that
man will not be returning to the same form of life, if as it seems, we
formerly existed by eating, and shall hereafter be free from that
function. I, however, when I hear the Holy Scripture, do not understand
only bodily meat, or the pleasure of the flesh; but I recognize another
kind of food also, having a certain analogy to that of the body, the
enjoyment of which extends to the soul alone: “Eat of my bread <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1671](#fn_1669.md) ,” is the bidding of Wisdom to the
hungry; and the Lord declares those blessed who hunger for such food as
this, and says, “If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink”:
and “drink ye joy <span id="fr_1670"></span>[1672](#fn_1670.md) ,” is the
great Isaiah’s charge to those who are able to hear his sublimity. There
is a prophetic threatening also against those worthy of vengeance, that
they shall be punished with famine; but the “famine” is not a lack of
bread and water, but a failure of the word:—“not a famine of bread, nor
a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1673](#fn_1671.md) .”

<span id="x.ii.ii.xx-p7"></span>2. We ought, then, to conceive that the
fruit in Eden was something worthy of God’s planting (and Eden is
interpreted to mean “delight”), and not to doubt that man was hereby
nourished: nor should we at all conceive, concerning the mode of life in
Paradise, this transitory and perishable nutriment: “of every tree of
the garden,” He says, “thou mayest freely eat <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[1674](#fn_1672.md) .”

<span id="x.ii.ii.xx-p9"></span>3. Who will give to him that has a
healthful hunger that tree that is in Paradise, which includes all good,
which is named “every tree,” in which this passage bestows on man the
right to share? for in the universal and transcendent saying every form
of good is in harmony with itself, and the whole is one. And who will
keep me back from that tasting of the tree which is of mixed and
doubtful kind? for surely it is clear to all who are at all keen-sighted
what that “every” tree is whose fruit is life, and what again that mixed
tree is whose end is death: for He Who presents ungrudgingly the
enjoyment of “every” tree, surely by some reason and forethought keeps
man from participation in those which are of doubtful kind.

<span id="x.ii.ii.xx-p10"></span>4. It seems to me that I may take the
great David and the wise Solomon as my instructors in the interpretation
of this text: for both understand the grace of the permitted delight to
be one,—that very actual Good, which in truth is “every” good;—David,
when he says, “Delight thou in the Lord <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1675](#fn_1673.md) ,” and Solomon, when he names
Wisdom herself (which is the Lord) “a tree of life <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1676](#fn_1674.md) .”

<span id="x.ii.ii.xx-p13"></span>5. Thus the “every” tree of which the
passage gives food to him who was made in the likeness of God, is the
same with the tree of life; and there is opposed to this tree another
tree, the food given by which is the knowledge of good and evil:—not
that it bears in turn as fruit each of these things of opposite
significance, but that it produces a fruit blended and mixed with
opposite qualities, the eating of which the Prince of Life forbids, and
the serpent counsels, that he may prepare an entrance for death: and he
obtained credence for his counsel, covering over the fruit with a fair
appearance and the show of pleasure, that it might be pleasant to the
eyes and stimulate the desire to taste.
