##  Elucidation.

The story of the "Revelation" is of little consequence, though, if this
were Gregory's genuine work, it would be easy to account for it as
originating in a beautiful dream. But it is very doubtful whether it be
a genuine work; and, to my mind, it is most fairly treated by Lardner,
to whose elaborate chapter concerning Gregory every scholar must
refer.<sup>[20](footnote/fn2.htm#P275_32981.md)</sup> Dr. Burton, in his
edition of Bishop Bull's
works,<sup>[21](footnote/fn2.htm#P276_33067.md)</sup> almost overrules that
learned prelate's inclination to think it genuine, in the following
words: "Hanc formulam minime esse Gregorii authenticam ... multis *haud
spernendis argumentis demonstrat* Lardner." Lardner thinks it a
fabrication of the fourth century.

Cave's learned judgment is more favourable; and he gives the
text<sup>[22](footnote/fn2.htm#P278_33410.md)</sup> from Gregory of Nyssa,
which he translates as follows: "There is one God, the Father of the
living Word and of the subsisting Wisdom and Power, and of Him who is
His Eternal Image, the perfect begetter of Him that is perfect, the
Father of the only-begotten Son. There is one Lord, the only *Son* of
the only *Father*, God of God, the character and image of the Godhead,
the powerful Word, the comprehensive Wisdom, by which all things were
made, and the Power that gave being to the whole creation, the true Son
of the true Father, the Invisible of the Invisible, the Incorruptible of
the Incorruptible, the Immortal of the Immortal, and the Eternal of Him
that is Eternal. There is one Holy Ghost, having its subsistence of God,
which appeared through the Son to mankind, the perfect Image of the
perfect Son, the Life-giving Life, the holy Fountain, the Sanctity, and
the Author of sanctification, by whom God the Father is made manifest,
who is over all, and in all; and God the Son, who is through all. A
perfect Trinity, which neither in glory, eternity, or dominion is
divided, or departed from itself."
