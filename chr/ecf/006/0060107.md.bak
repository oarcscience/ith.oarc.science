##  Elucidations.

I

Some points, p. 289.

That the theology of the great school of Alexandria had a character of
its own, is most apparent; I should be the last to deny it. As its
succession of teachers was like that of hereditary descent in a family,
a family likeness is naturally to be found in this school, from the
great Clement to the great Athanasius. It is a school that hands on the
traditions in which Apollos had been reared; it not less reflects the
Greek influences always dominant in the capital of the Macedonian hero;
but it is a school in which the Gospel of Christ as the Light of the
world was always made *predominant*: and, while a most liberal view of
human *knowledge* was inculcated in it, yet *the faith* was always
exalted as the mother and mistress of the true *gnosis* and of all
science. The wise men of this world were summoned with an imperial
voice, from this eldest seat and centre of Christian learning, to cast
their crowns and their treasures at the feet of Jesus. With a generous
patronage Clement conceded all he could to the philosophy of the Greeks,
and yet sublimely rose above it to a sphere it never discovered, and
looked down upon all merely human intellect and its achievements like
Uriel in the sun.

It was the special though unconscious mission of this school to prepare
the way, and to shape the thought of Christendom, for the great epoch of
the (nominal) conversion of the empire, and for the all-important
synodical period, its logical consequence. It was in this school that
the technical formulas of the Church were naturally wrought out. The
process was like that of the artist who has first to make his own tools.
He does many things, and resorts to many contrivances, never afterwards
necessary when once the tools are complete and his laboratory furnished
with all he wants for his work. To my mind, therefore, it is but a
pastime of no practical worth to contrast the idiosyncrasies of Clement
with those of Origen, and to set up distinctions between the Logos of
this doctor and that.<sup>[78](footnote/fn47.md)</sup> The differences to
be descried belong to the personal peculiarities of great minds not yet
guided to unity of diction by a scientific theology. The marvel is their
harmony of thought. Their ends and their antagonisms are the same. The
outcome of their mental efforts and their pious faith is seen in the
result. Alexander was their product, and Athanasius (bringing all their
sheaves to the Church's garner, winnowed and harvested) is the perpetual
*gnomon* of the Alexandrian school. Its testimony, its prescription, its
harmony and unity, are all summed up in him.

It is extraordinary that many truly evangelical critics seem to see, in
the *subordination* taught by
Origen,<sup>[79](footnote/fn47.htm#P4799_1451185.md)</sup> something not
reconcileable with the Nicene orthodoxy. Even Bishop Bull is a
*subordinationist*, and so are all the great orthodox divines. When
Origen maintains the monarxi/a (the Father as the root and source of the
Godhead, as do all the
Greeks<sup>[80](footnote/fn48.htm#P4800_1451495)</sup> .md), and also a
subordination of the Son in the divine ou0si/a, he is surely consistent
with the Athanasian
doctrine;<sup>[81](footnote/fn48.htm#P4801_1451677.md)</sup> and, if he is
led to affirm a diversity of essence in connection with this
subordination, he does it with such limitations as should convince us
that he, too, would have subscribed the o9moou/sion, in which
Alexandrians no whit inferior to him finally formulated the convictions
and testimonies of their
predecessors.<sup>[82](footnote/fn48.htm#P4802_1452292.md)</sup>

II

Since the body of the Catholic Church is one, etc., p. 296.

As so shortly preceding the meeting of the Great Council, this letter is
most important as a clear testimony to the meaning the first council
attached to that article of the Creed which affirms "one holy Catholic
and Apostolic Church." We must compare the Treatises of Cyprian for the
West, with this and the Letter of
Firmilian<sup>[83](footnote/fn48.htm#P4807_1452741.md)</sup> for the East,
as clearly elucidating the contemporary mind of the Church, and hence
the meaning of those words which reflect their mind in the Creed. To
make any reflections of my own would be out of place, save only,
negatively, as I compare it with the modern creed of the Council of
Trent (Pius IV.), which defines the Catholic Church to be the communion
which acknowledges the Church of Rome as "the mother and mistress of
churches."

The concluding section of this letter is decisive as to the absolute
*autonomy* of the Alexandrian
*dioecese*.<sup>[84](footnote/fn48.htm#P4809_1453319.md)</sup> To all the
other churches Alexander merely communicates his sentence, which they
are all bound to respect. Whether the Christian Church at this period
reflected the Apostolic Institutions is not the question, but merely
what its theory was in the fourth century, and how far East and West
accorded with the theory of Cyprian.
