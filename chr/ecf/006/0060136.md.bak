##  Book III.

------------

1\. All these charges, then, which might truly be better termed abuse,
have been long answered with sufficient fulness and accuracy by men of
distinction in this respect, and worthy to have learned the truth; and
not one point of any inquiry has been passed over, without being
determined in a thousand ways, and on the strongest grounds. We need
not, therefore, linger further on this part of the case. For neither is
the Christian religion unable to stand though it found no advocates, nor
will it be therefore proved true if it found many to agree with it, and
gained weight through its adherents.<sup>[1](footnote/fn72.md)</sup> Its
own strength is sufficient for it, and it rests on the foundations of
its own truth, without losing its power, though there were none to
defend it, nay, though all voices assailed and opposed it, and united
with common rancour to destroy all
faith<sup>[2](footnote/fn72.htm#P7257_2280686.md)</sup> in it.

2\. Let us now return to the order from which we were a little ago
compelled to diverge, that our defence may not, through its being too
long broken off, be said to have given our detractors cause to triumph
in the establishing of their charge. For they propose these questions:
If you are in earnest about religion, why do you not serve and worship
the other gods with us, or share your sacred rites with your fellows,
and put the ceremonies of the *different* religions on an equality? We
may say for the present: In essaying to approach the divine, the Supreme
Deity<sup>[3](footnote/fn72.htm#P7259_2281358.md)</sup> suffices us,-the
Deity, I say, who is supreme, the Creator and Lord of the universe, who
orders and rules all things: in Him we serve all that requires our
service; *in Him* we worship all that should be
adored,-venerate<sup>[4](footnote/fn72.htm#P7260_2281729.md)</sup> that
which demands the homage of our reverence. For as we lay hold of the
source of the divine itself from which the very divinity of all gods
whatever is derived,<sup>[5](footnote/fn72.htm#P7261_2281934.md)</sup> we
think it an idle task to approach each personally, since we neither know
who they are, nor the names by which they are called; and are further
unable to learn, and discover, and establish their number.

3\. And as in the kingdoms of earth we are in no wise constrained
expressly to do reverence to those who form the royal family as well as
to the sovereigns, but whatever honour belongs to them is found to be
tacitly<sup>[6](footnote/fn72.htm#P7263_2282451.md)</sup> implied in the
homage offered to the kings themselves; in just the same way, these
gods, whoever they be, for whose existence you vouch, if they are a
royal race, and spring from the Supreme Ruler, even though we do not
expressly do them reverence, yet feel that they are honoured in common
with their Lord, and share in the reverence shown to Him. Now *it must
be remembered that* we have made this statement, on the hypothesis only
that it is clear and undeniable, that besides the Ruler and Lord
Himself, there are still other
beings,<sup>[7](footnote/fn72.htm#P7264_2283337.md)</sup> who, when
arranged and disposed in order, form, as it were, a kind of plebeian
mass. But do not seek to point out to us pictures instead of gods in
your temples, and the images which you set up, for you too know, but are
unwilling and refuse to admit, that these are formed of most worthless
clay, and are childish figures made by mechanics. And when we converse
with you on religion, we ask you to prove this, that there are other
gods *than the one Supreme Deity* in nature, power, name, not as we see
them manifested in images, but in such a substance as it might fittingly
be supposed that perfection of so great dignity should reside.

4\. But we do not purpose delaying further on this part of the subject,
lest we seem desirous to stir up most violent strife, and engage in
agitating contests.

Let there be, as you affirm, that crowd of deities, let there be
numberless families of gods; we assent, agree, *and* do not examine too
*closely*, nor in any part of the subject do we assail the doubtful and
uncertain positions you hold. This, however, we demand, and ask you to
tell us, whence you have discovered, or how you have learned, whether
there are these gods,<sup>[8](footnote/fn72.htm#P7267_2284716.md)</sup>
whom you believe to be in heaven and serve, or some others unknown by
reputation and name? For it may be that beings exist whom you do not
believe to do so; and that those of whose existence you feel assured,
are found nowhere in the universe. For you have at no time been borne
aloft to the stars of heaven, *at no time* have seen the face and
countenance of each; and *then* established here the worship of the same
gods, whom you remembered to be there, as having been known and seen *by
you*. But this, too, we again would learn from you, whether they have
received these names by which you call them, or assumed them themselves
on the days of
purification.<sup>[9](footnote/fn72.htm#P7268_2285463.md)</sup> If these
are divine and celestial names, who reported them to you? But if, on the
other hand, these names have been applied to them by you, how could you
give names to those whom you never saw, and whose character or
circumstances you in no
wise<sup>[10](footnote/fn72.htm#P7269_2285882.md)</sup> knew?

5\. But *let it be assumed* that there are these gods, as you wish and
believe, and are persuaded; let them be called also by those names by
which the common people suppose that those meaner
gods<sup>[11](footnote/fn72.htm#P7271_2286228.md)</sup> are
known.<sup>[12](footnote/fn72.htm#P7272_2286395.md)</sup> Whence, however,
have you learned who make up the list *of gods* under these
names?<sup>[13](footnote/fn72.htm#P7273_2286527.md)</sup> have any ever
become familiar and known *to others* with whose names you were not
acquainted?<sup>[14](footnote/fn72.htm#P7274_2286677.md)</sup> For it
cannot be easily known whether their numerous body is settled and fixed
*in number*; or whether their multitude cannot be summed up and limited
by the numbers of any computation. For let us suppose that you do
reverence to a thousand, or rather five thousand gods; but in the
universe it may perhaps be that there are a hundred thousand; there may
be even more than this,-nay, as we said a little before, it may not be
possible to compute the number of the gods, or limit them by a definite
number. Either, then, you are yourselves impious who serve a few gods,
but disregard the duties which you owe to the
rest;<sup>[15](footnote/fn72.htm#P7275_2287504.md)</sup> or if you claim
that your ignorance of the rest should be pardoned, you will procure for
us also a similar pardon, if in just the same
way<sup>[16](footnote/fn72.htm#P7276_2287723.md)</sup> we refuse to worship
those of whose existence we are wholly ignorant.

6\. And yet let no one think that we are perversely determined not to
submit to<sup>[17](footnote/fn72.htm#P7278_2287975.md)</sup> the other
deities, whoever they are! For we *lift up* pious minds, and stretch
forth our hands in
prayer,<sup>[18](footnote/fn72.htm#P7279_2288220.md)</sup> and do not
refuse to draw near whithersoever you may have summoned us; if only we
learn who those divine beings are whom you press upon us, and with whom
it may be right to share the reverence which we show to the king and
prince who is over all. It is Saturn, *my opponent says*, and Janus,
Minerva, Juno, Apollo, Venus, Triptolemus, Hercules, Aesculapius, and
all the others, to whom the reverence of antiquity dedicated magnificent
temples in almost every city. You might, perhaps, have been able to
attract us to the worship of these deities you mention, had you not been
yourselves the first, with foul and unseemly fancies, to devise such
tales about them as not merely to stain their honour, but, by the
natures assigned to them, to prove that they did not exist at all. For,
in the first place, we cannot be led to believe this,-that that immortal
and supreme nature has been divided by sexes, and that there are some
male, others female. But this point, indeed, has been long ago fully
treated of by men of ardent genius, both in Latin and Greek; and
Tullius, the most eloquent among the Romans, without dreading the
vexatiousness of a charge of impiety, has above all, with greater
piety,<sup>[19](footnote/fn72.htm#P7280_2289758.md)</sup> declared-boldly,
firmly, and frankly-what he thought of such a fancy; and if you would
proceed to receive from him opinions written with true discernment,
instead of *merely* brilliant sentences, this case would have been
concluded; nor would it require at our weak
hands<sup>[20](footnote/fn72.htm#P7281_2290084.md)</sup> a second
pleading,<sup>[21](footnote/fn72.htm#P7282_2290178.md)</sup> as it is
termed.

7\. But why should I say that men seek from him subtleties of expression
and splendour of diction, when I know that there are many who avoid and
flee from his books on this subject, and will not hear his opinions
read,<sup>[22](footnote/fn72.htm#P7284_2290526.md)</sup> overthrowing their
prejudices; and when I hear others muttering angrily, and saying that
the senate should decree the
destruction<sup>[23](footnote/fn72.htm#P7285_2290737.md)</sup> of these
writings by which the Christian religion is maintained, and the weight
of antiquity overborne? But, indeed, if you are convinced that anything
you say regarding your gods is beyond doubt, point out Cicero's error,
refute, rebut his rash and impious
words,<sup>[24](footnote/fn72.htm#P7286_2291104.md)</sup> *and* show *that
they are so*. For when you would carry off writings, and suppress a book
given forth to the public, you are not defending the gods, but dreading
the evidence of the truth.

8\. And yet, that no thoughtless person may raise a false accusation
against us, as though we believed God whom we worship to be male,-for
this reason, that is, that when we speak of Him we use a masculine
word,-let him understand that it is not sex which is expressed, but His
name, and its meaning according to custom, and the way in which we are
in the habit of using
words.<sup>[25](footnote/fn72.htm#P7288_2291813.md)</sup> For the Deity is
not male, but His name is of the masculine gender: but in your
ceremonies you cannot say the same; for in your prayers you have been
wont to say *whether thou art god or
goddess*,<sup>[26](footnote/fn72.htm#P7289_2292049.md)</sup> and this
uncertain description shows, even by their opposition, that you
attribute sex to the gods. We cannot, then, be prevailed on to believe
that the divine is embodied; for bodies must needs be distinguished by
difference of sex, if they are male and female. For who, however mean
his capacity,<sup>[27](footnote/fn72.htm#P7290_2292566.md)</sup> does not
know that the sexes of different gender have been ordained and formed by
the Creator of the creatures of earth, only that, by intercourse and
union of bodies, that which is fleeting and transient may endure being
ever renewed and
maintained?<sup>[28](footnote/fn72.htm#P7291_2292858.md)</sup>

9\. What, then, shall we say? That gods beget and are
begotten?<sup>[29](footnote/fn72.htm#P7293_2292975.md)</sup> and that
therefore they have received organs of generation, that they might be
able to raise up offspring, and that, as each new race springs up, a
substitution, regularly
occurring,<sup>[30](footnote/fn72.htm#P7294_2293191.md)</sup> should make
up for all which had been swept away by the preceding age? If, then, it
is so,-that is, if the gods above beget *other gods*, and are subject to
these conditions of sex,<sup>[31](footnote/fn72.htm#P7295_2293411.md)</sup>
and are immortal, and are not worn out, by the chills of age,-it
follows, as a consequence, that the
world<sup>[32](footnote/fn72.htm#P7296_2293578.md)</sup> should be full of
gods, and that countless heavens could not contain their multitude,
inasmuch as they are both themselves ever begetting, and the countless
multitude of their descendants, always being increased, is augmented by
means of their offspring; or if, as is fitting, the gods are not
degraded by being subjected to sexual
impulses,<sup>[33](footnote/fn72.htm#P7297_2293950.md)</sup> what cause or
reason will be pointed out for their being distinguished by those
members by which the sexes are wont to recognise each other at the
suggestion of their own desires? For it is not likely that they have
these without a purpose, or that nature had wished in them to make sport
of its own improvidence,<sup>[34](footnote/fn72.htm#P7298_2294334.md)</sup>
in providing them with members for which there would be no use. For as
the hands, feet, eyes, and other members which form our
body,<sup>[35](footnote/fn72.htm#P7299_2294495.md)</sup> have been arranged
for certain uses, each for its own end, so we may
well<sup>[36](footnote/fn73.md)</sup> believe that these members have been
provided to discharge their office; or it must be confessed that there
is something without a purpose in the bodies of the gods, which has been
made uselessly and in vain.

10\. What say you, ye holy and pure guardians of religion? Have the
gods, then, sexes; and are they disfigured by those parts, the very
mention of whose names by modest lips is disgraceful? What, then, now
remains, but to believe that they, as unclean beasts, are transported
with violent passions, rush with maddened desires into mutual embraces,
and at last, with shattered and ruined bodies, are enfeebled by their
sensuality? And since some things are peculiar to the female sex, we
must believe that the goddesses, too, submit to these conditions at the
proper time, conceive and become pregnant with loathing, miscarry, carry
the full time, and sometimes are prematurely delivered. O divinity,
pure, holy, free from and unstained by any dishonourable blot! The mind
longs<sup>[37](footnote/fn73.htm#P7302_2295640.md)</sup> and burns to see,
in the great halls and palaces of heaven, gods and goddesses, with
bodies uncovered and bare, the full-breasted Ceres nursing
Iacchus,<sup>[38](footnote/fn73.htm#P7303_2295961.md)</sup> as the muse of
Lucretius sings, the Hellespontian Priapus bearing about among the
goddesses, virgin and matron, those
parts<sup>[39](footnote/fn73.htm#P7304_2296218.md)</sup> ever prepared for
encounter. It longs, I say, to see goddesses pregnant, goddesses with
child, and, as they daily increase in size, faltering in their steps,
through the irksomeness of the burden they bear about with them; others,
after long delay, bringing to birth, and seeking the midwife's aid;
others, shrieking as they are attacked by keen pangs and grievous pains,
tormented,<sup>[40](footnote/fn73.htm#P7305_2296622.md)</sup> and, under
all these influences, imploring the aid of Juno Lucina. Is it not much
better to abuse, revile, and otherwise insult the gods, than, with pious
pretence, unworthily to entertain such monstrous beliefs about them?

11\. And you dare to charge us with offending the gods, although, on
examination, it is found that the ground of offence is most clearly in
ourselves, and that it is not occasioned by the insult which you
think<sup>[41](footnote/fn73.htm#P7307_2297198.md)</sup> . For if the gods
are, as you say, moved by anger, and burn with rage in their minds, why
should we not suppose that they take it amiss, even in the highest
degree, that you attribute to them sexes, as dogs and swine have been
created, and that, since this is your belief, they are so represented,
and openly exposed in a disgraceful manner? This, then, being the case,
you are the cause of all troubles-you lead the gods, you rouse them to
harass the earth with every ill, and every day to devise all kinds of
fresh misfortunes, that so they may avenge themselves, being irritated
at suffering so many wrongs and insults from you. By your insults and
affronts, I say, partly in the vile stories, partly in the shameful
beliefs which your theologians, your poets, you yourselves too,
celebrate in disgraceful ceremonies, you will find that the affairs of
men have been ruined, and that the gods have thrown away the helm, if
indeed it is by their care that the fortunes of men are guided and
arranged. For with us, indeed, they have no reason to be angry, whom
they see and perceive neither to mock, as it is said, nor worship them,
and to think,<sup>[42](footnote/fn73.htm#P7308_2298561.md)</sup> to believe
much more worthily than you with regard to the dignity of their name.

12\. Thus far of sex. Now let us come to the appearance and shapes by
which yon believe that the gods above have been represented, with which,
indeed, you fashion, and set them up in their most splendid abodes, your
temples. And let no one here bring up against us Jewish fables and those
of the sect of the
Sadducees,<sup>[43](footnote/fn73.htm#P7310_2299095.md)</sup> as though we,
too, attribute to the Deity
forms;<sup>[44](footnote/fn73.htm#P7311_2299271.md)</sup> for this is
supposed to be taught in their writings, and asserted as if with
assurance and authority. For these stories either do not concern us, and
have nothing at all in common with us, or if they are shared in *by us*,
as you believe, you must seek out teachers of greater wisdom, through
whom you may be able to learn how best to overcome the dark and
recondite sayings of those writings. Our opinion on the subject is as
follows:-that the whole divine nature, since it neither came into
existence at any time, nor will ever come to an end of life, is devoid
of bodily features, and does not have anything like the forms with which
the termination of the several members usually. completes the union of
parts.<sup>[45](footnote/fn73.htm#P7312_2300155.md)</sup> For whatever is
of this character, we think mortal and perishable; nor do we believe
that that can endure for ever which an inevitable end shuts in, though
the boundaries enclosing it be the remotest.

13\. But it is not enough that you limit the gods by forms:-you even
confine them to the human figure, and with even less decency enclose
them in earthly bodies. What shall we say then? that the gods have a
head modelled with perfect
symmetry,<sup>[46](footnote/fn73.htm#P7314_2300640.md)</sup> bound fast by
sinews to the back and breast, and that, to allow the necessary bending
of the neck, it is supported by combinations of *vertebrae*, and by an
osseous foundation? But if we believe this to be true, it follows that
they have ears also, pierced by crooked windings; rolling eyeballs,
overshadowed by the edges of the eyebrows; a nose, placed as a
channel,<sup>[47](footnote/fn73.htm#P7315_2301074.md)</sup> through which
waste fluids and a current of air might easily pass; teeth to masticate
food, of three kinds, and adapted to three services; hands to do their
work, moving easily by means of joints, fingers, and flexible elbows;
feet to support their bodies, regulate their steps, and prompt the first
motions in walking. But if the *gods bear* these things which are seen,
it is fitting that they should bear those also which the skin conceals
under the framework of the ribs, and the membranes enclosing the
viscera; windpipes, stomachs, spleens, lungs, bladders, livers, the
long-entwined intestines, and the veins of purple blood, joined with the
air-passages,<sup>[48](footnote/fn73.htm#P7316_2301802.md)</sup> coursing
through the whole viscera.

14\. Are, then, the divine bodies free from these deformities? and since
they do not eat the food of men, are we to believe that, like children,
they are toothless, and, having no internal parts, as if they were
inflated bladders, are without strength, owing to the hollowness of
their swollen bodies? Further, if this is the case, you must see whether
the gods are all alike, or are marked by a difference in the contour of
their forms. For if each and all have one and the same likeness of
shape, there is nothing ridiculous in believing that they err, and are
deceived in recognising each
other.<sup>[49](footnote/fn73.htm#P7318_2302713.md)</sup> But if, on the
other hand, they are distinguished by their countenances, we should,
consequently, understand that these differences have been implanted for
no other reason than that they might individually be able to recognise
themselves by the peculiarites of the different marks. We should
therefore say that some have big heads, prominent brows, broad brows,
thick lips; that others of them have long chins, moles, and high noses;
that these have dilated nostrils, those are snub-nosed; some chubby from
a swelling of their jaws or growth of their cheeks, dwarfed, tall, of
middle size, lean, sleek, fat; some with crisped and curled hair, others
shaven, with bald and smooth heads. Now your workshops show and point
out that our opinions are not false, inasmuch as, when you form and
fashion gods, you represent some with long hair, others smooth and bare,
as old, as youths, as boys, swarthy, grey-eyed, yellow, half-naked,
bare; or, that cold may not annoy them, covered with flowing garments
thrown over them.

15\. Does any man at all possessed of judgment, believe that hairs and
down grow on the bodies of the gods? that among them age is
distinguished? and that they go about clad in dresses and garments of
various shapes, and shield themselves from heat and cold? But if any one
believes that, he must receive this also as true, that some gods are
fullers, some barbers; the former to cleanse the sacred garments, the
latter to thin their locks when matted with a thick growth of hair. Is
not this really degrading, most impious, and insulting, to attribute to
the gods the features of a frail and perishing animal? to furnish them
with those members which no modest person would dare to recount, and
describe, or represent in his own imagination, without shuddering at the
excessive indecency? Is this the contempt you entertain,-this the proud
wisdom with which you spurn us as ignorant, and think that all knowledge
of religion is yours? You mock the mysteries of the Egyptians, because
they ingrafted the forms of dumb animals upon their divine causes, and
because they worship these very images with much incense, and whatever
else is used in such rites: you yourselves adore images of men, as
though they were powerful gods, and are not ashamed to give to these the
countenance of an earthly creature, to blame others for their mistaken
folly, and to be detected in a similarly vicious error.

16\. But you will, perhaps, say that the gods have indeed other forms,
and that you have given the appearance of men to them *merely* by way of
honour, and for form's
sake<sup>[50](footnote/fn73.htm#P7321_2305345.md)</sup> which is much more
insulting than to have fallen into any error through ignorance. For if
you confessed that you had ascribed to the divine forms that which you
had supposed and believed, your error, originating in prejudice, would
not be so blameable. But now, when you believe one thing and fashion
another, you both dishonour those to whom yon ascribe that which you
confess does not belong to them, and show your impiety in adoring that
which you fashion, not that which you think really is, and which is in
very truth. If asses, dogs,
pigs,<sup>[51](footnote/fn73.htm#P7322_2306018.md)</sup> had any human
wisdom and skill in contrivance, and wished to do us honour also by some
kind of worship, and to show respect by dedicating statues *to us,* with
what rage would they inflame us, what a tempest of passion would they
excite, if they determined that our images should bear and assume the
fashion of their own bodies? How would they, I repeat, fill us with
rage, and rouse our passions, if the founder of Rome, Romulus, were to
be set up with an ass's face, the revered Pompilius with that of a dog,
if under the image of a pig were written Cato's or Marcus Cicero's name?
So, then, do you think that your stupidity is not laughed at by your
deities, if they laugh *at all*? or, since you believe that they may be
enraged, *do you think* that they are not roused, maddened to fury, and
that they do not wish to be revenged for so great wrongs and insults,
and to hurl on you the punishments usually dictated by chagrin, and
devised by bitter hatred? How much better it had been to give to them
the forms of elephants, panthers, or tigers, bulls, and horses! For what
is there beautiful in man,-what, I pray you, worthy of admiration, or
comely,-unless that which, some
poet<sup>[52](footnote/fn73.htm#P7323_2307479.md)</sup> has maintained, he
possesses in common with the ape?

17\. But, they say, if you are not satisfied with our opinion, do you
point out, tell us yourselves, what is the Deity's form. If you wish to
hear the truth, either the Deity has no form; or if He is embodied in
one, we indeed know not what it is. Moreover, we think it no disgrace to
be ignorant of that which we never saw; nor are we therefore prevented
from disproving the opinions of others, because on this we have no
opinion of our own to bring forward. For as, if the earth be said to be
of glass, silver, iron, or gathered together and made from brittle clay,
we cannot hesitate to maintain that this is untrue, although we do not
know of what it is made; so, when the form of God is discussed, we show
that it is not what you maintain, even if we are *still* less able to
explain what it is.

18\. What, then, some one will say, does the Deity not hear? does He not
speak? does He not see what is put before Him? has He not sight? He may
in His own, but not in our way. But in so great a matter we cannot know
the truth at all, or reach it by speculations; for these are, it is
clear, in our case, baseless, deceitful, and like vain dreams. For if we
said that He sees in the same way as ourselves, it follows that it
should be understood that He has eyelids placed as coverings on the
pupils of the eyes, that He closes them, winks, sees by rays or images,
or, as is the case in all eyes, can see nothing at all without the
presence of other light. So we must in like manner say of hearing, and
form of speech, and utterance of words. If He hears by means of ears,
these, too, *we must say*, He has, penetrated by winding paths, through
which the sound may steal, bearing the meaning of the discourse; or if
His words are poured forth from a mouth, that He has lips and teeth, by
the contact and various movement of which His tongue utters sounds
distinctly.

19\. If you are willing to hear our conclusions, *then learn that* we
are so far from attributing bodily shape to the Deity, that we fear to
ascribe to so great a being even mental graces, and the very excellences
by which a few have been allowed with difficulty to distinguish
themselves. For who will say that God is brave, firm, good, wise? who
*will say* that He has integrity, is temperate, even that He has
knowledge, understanding, forethought? that He directs towards fixed
moral ends the actions on which He determines? These things are good in
man; and being opposed to vices, have deserved the great reputation
which they have gained. But who is so foolish, so senseless, as to say
that God is great by *merely* human excellences? or that He is above all
in the greatness of His name, because He is not disgraced by vice?
Whatever you say, whatever in unspoken thought you imagine concerning
God, passes and is corrupted into a human sense, and does not carry its
own meaning, because it is spoken in the words which we use, and which
are suited *only* to human affairs. There is but one thing man can be
assured of regarding God's nature, to know and perceive that nothing can
be revealed in human language concerning God.

20\. This, then, this matter of forms and sexes, is the first affront
which you, noble advocates in sooth, and pious writers, offer to your
deities. But what is the next, that you represent to
us<sup>[53](footnote/fn73.htm#P7328_2310900.md)</sup> the gods, some as
artificers, some physicians, others working in wool, as
sailors,<sup>[54](footnote/fn73.htm#P7329_2311081.md)</sup> players on the
harp and flute, hunters, shepherds, and, as there was nothing more,
rustics? And that god, he says, is a musician, and this other can
divine; for the other gods
cannot,<sup>[55](footnote/fn73.htm#P7330_2311408.md)</sup> and do not know
how to foretell what will come to pass, owing to their want of skill and
ignorance of the future. One is instructed in obstetric arts, another
trained up in the science of medicine. Is each, then, powerful in his
own department; and can they give no assistance, if their aid is asked,
in what belongs to another? This one is eloquent in speech, and ready in
linking words together; for the others are stupid, and can say nothing
skilfully, if they must speak.

21\. And, I ask, what reason is there, what unavoidable necessity, what
occasion for the gods knowing and being acquainted with these
handicrafts as though they were worthless mechanics? For, are songs sung
and music played in heaven, that the nine sisters may gracefully combine
and harmonize pauses and rhythms of tones? Are there on the
mountains<sup>[56](footnote/fn73.htm#P7332_2312407.md)</sup> of the stars,
forests, woods, groves,
that<sup>[57](footnote/fn73.htm#P7333_2312698.md)</sup> Diana may be
esteemed very mighty in hunting expeditions? Are the gods ignorant of
the immediate future; and do they live and pass the time according to
the lots assigned them by fate, that the inspired son of Latona may
explain and declare what the morrow or the next hour bears to each? Is
he himself inspired by another god, and is he urged and roused by the
power of a greater divinity, so that he may be rightly said and esteemed
to be divinely inspired? Are the gods liable to be seized by diseases;
and is there anything by which they may be wounded and hurt, so that,
when there is occasion,
he<sup>[58](footnote/fn73.htm#P7334_2313422.md)</sup> of Epidaurus may come
to their assistance? Do they labour, do they bring forth, that Juno may
soothe, and Lucina abridge the terrible pangs of childbirth? Do they
engage in agriculture, or are they concerned with the duties of war,
that Vulcan, the lord of fire, may form for them swords, or forge their
rustic implements? Do they need to be covered with garments, that the
Tritonian<sup>[59](footnote/fn73.htm#P7335_2313830.md)</sup> maid may, with
nice skill,<sup>[60](footnote/fn73.htm#P7336_2313921.md)</sup> spin, weave
cloth for them, and make<sup>[61](footnote/fn73.htm#P7337_2314078.md)</sup>
them tunics to suit the season, either triple-twilled, or of silken
fabric? Do they make accusations and refute them, that the
descendant<sup>[62](footnote/fn73.htm#P7338_2314310.md)</sup> of Atlas may
carry off the prize for eloquence, attained by assiduous practice?

22\. You err, *my opponent says*, and are deceived; for the gods are not
themselves artificers, but suggest these arts to ingenious men, and
teach mortals what they should know, that their mode of life may be more
civilized. But he who gives any instruction to the ignorant and
unwilling, and strives to make him intelligently expert in some kind of
work, must himself first know that which he sets the other to practise.
For no one can be capable of teaching a science without knowing the
rules of that which he teaches, and having grasped its method most
thoroughly. The gods are, then, the first artificers; whether because
they inform the *minds of men* with knowledge, as you say yourselves, or
because, being immortal and unbegotten, they surpass the whole race of
earth by their length of
life.<sup>[63](footnote/fn73.htm#P7340_2315228.md)</sup> This, then, is the
question; there being no occasion for these arts among the gods, neither
their necessities nor nature requiring in them any ingenuity or
mechanical skill, why you should say that they are
skilled,<sup>[64](footnote/fn73.htm#P7341_2315487.md)</sup> one in one
craft, another in another, and that individuals are pre-eminently
expert<sup>[65](footnote/fn73.htm#P7342_2315735.md)</sup> in particular
departments in which they are distinguished by acquaintance with the
several branches of science?

23\. But you will, perhaps, say that the gods are not artificers, but
that they preside over these arts, *and* have their oversight; nay, that
under their care all things have been placed, which we manage and
conduct, and that their providence sees to the happy and fortunate issue
of these. Now this would certainly appear to be said justly, and with
some probability, if all we engage in, all we do, or all we attempt in
human affairs, sped as we wished and purposed. But since every day the
reverse is the case, and the results of actions do not correspond to the
purpose of the will, it is trifling to say that we have, set as
guardians over as, gods invented by our superstitious fancy, not grasped
with assured certainty.
Portunus<sup>[66](footnote/fn73.htm#P7344_2316649.md)</sup> gives to the
sailor perfect safety in traversing the seas; but why has the raging sea
cast up so many cruelly-shattered wrecks? Consus suggests to our minds
courses safe and serviceable; and why does an unexpected change
perpetually issue in results other than were looked for? Pales and
Inuus<sup>[67](footnote/fn73.htm#P7345_2317240.md)</sup> are set as
guardians over the flocks and herds; why do they, with hurtful
laziness,<sup>[68](footnote/fn73.htm#P7346_2317392.md)</sup> not take care
to avert from the herds in their summer pastures, cruel, infectious, and
destructive diseases? The harlot
Flora,<sup>[69](footnote/fn73.htm#P7347_2317563.md)</sup> venerated in lewd
sports, sees well to it that the fields blossom; and why are buds and
tender plants daily nipt and destroyed by most hurtful frost? Juno
presides over childbirth, and aids travailing mothers; and why are a
thousand mothers every day cut off in murderous throes? Fire is under
Vulcan's care, and its source is placed under his control; and why does
he, very often, suffer temples and parts of cities to fall into ashes
devoured by flames? The soothsayers receive the knowledge of their art
from the Pythian god; and why does he so often give and afford answers
equivocal, doubtful, steeped in darkness and obscurity? Aesculapius
presides over the duties and arts of medicine; and why cannot men in
more kinds of disease and sickness be restored to health and soundness
of body? while, on the contrary, they become worse under the hands of
the physician. Mercury is occupied
with<sup>[70](footnote/fn73.htm#P7348_2318599.md)</sup> combats, and
presides over boxing and wrestling matches; and why does he not make all
invincible who are in his charge? why, when appointed to one office,
does he enable some to win the victory, while he suffers others to be
ridiculed for their disgraceful weakness?

24\. No one, says my opponent, makes supplication to the tutelar
deities, and they therefore withhold their usual favours and help.
Cannot the gods, then, do good, except they receive incense and
consecrated offerings?<sup>[71](footnote/fn73.htm#P7350_2319146.md)</sup>
and do they quit and renounce their posts, unless they see their altars
anointed with the blood of cattle? And vet I thought but now that the
kindness of the gods was of their own free will, and that the
unlooked-for gifts of benevolence flowed unsought from them. Is, then,
the King of the universe solicited by any libation or sacrifice to grant
to the races of men all the comforts of life? Does the Deity not impart
the sun's fertilizing warmth, and the season of night, the winds, the
rains, the fruits, to all alike,-the good and the bad, the unjust and
the just,<sup>[72](footnote/fn73.htm#P7351_2319794.md)</sup> the free-born
and the slave, the poor and the rich? For this belongs to the true and
mighty God, to show kindness, unasked, to that which is weary and
feeble, and always encompassed by misery, of many kinds. For to grant
your prayers on the offering of sacrifices, is not to bring help to
those who ask it, but to sell the riches of their beneficence. We men
trifle, and are foolish in so great a matter; and, forgetting
what<sup>[73](footnote/fn73.htm#P7352_2320246.md)</sup> God is, and the
majesty of His name, associate with the tutelar deities whatever
meanness or baseness our morbid credulity can invent.

25\. Unxia, *my opponent says*, presides over the anointing *of
door-posts*; Cinxia over the loosening of the zone; the most venerable
Victa<sup>[74](footnote/fn73.htm#P7354_2320602.md)</sup> and Potua attend
to eating and drinking. O rare and admirable interpretation of the
divine powers! would gods not have
names<sup>[75](footnote/fn73.htm#P7355_2320753.md)</sup> if brides did not
besmear their husbands' door-posts with greasy ointment; were it not
that husbands, when now eagerly drawing near, unbind the maiden-girdle;
if men did not eat and drink? Moreover, not satisfied to have subjected
and involved the gods in cares so unseemly, you also ascribe to them
dispositions fierce, cruel, savage, ever rejoicing in the ills and
destruction of mankind.

26\. We shall not here mention Laverna, goddess of thieves, the
Bellonae, Discordiae, Furiae thieves, and we pass by in utter silence
the unpropitious deities whom you have set up. We shall bring forward
Mars himself, and the fair mother of the Desires; to one of whom you
commit wars, to the other love and passionate desire. My opponent says
that Mars has power over wars; whether to quell those which are raging,
or to revive them when interrupted, and kindle them in time of peace?
For if he claims the madness of war, why do wars rage every day? but if
he is their author, we shall then say that the god, to satisfy his own
inclination, involves the whole world in strife; sows the seeds of
discord and variance between far-distant peoples; gathers so many
thousand men from different quarters, and speedily heaps up the field
with dead bodies; makes the streams flow with blood, sweeps away the
most firmly-founded empires, lays cities in the dust, robs the free of
their liberty, and makes them slaves; rejoices in civil strife, in the
bloody death of brothers who die in conflict, and, in fine, in the dire,
murderous contest of children with their fathers.

27\. Now we may apply this very argument to Venus in exactly the same
way. For if, as you maintain and believe, she fills men's minds with
lustful thoughts, it must be held in consequence that any disgrace and
misdeed arising from such madness should be ascribed to the instigation
of Venus. Is it, then, under compulsion of the goddess that even the
noble too often betray their own reputation into the hands of worthless
harlots; that the firm bonds of marriage are broken; that near relations
burn with incestuous lust; that mothers have their passions madly
kindled towards their children; that fathers turn to themselves their
daughters' desires; that old men, bringing shame upon their grey hairs,
sigh with the ardour of youth for the gratification of filthy desires;
that wise and brave<sup>[76](footnote/fn73.htm#P7358_2323211.md)</sup> men,
losing in effeminacy the strength of their manhood, disregard the
biddings of constancy; that the noose is twisted about their necks; that
blazing pyres are
ascended;<sup>[77](footnote/fn73.htm#P7359_2323475.md)</sup> and that in
different places men, leaping voluntarily, cast themselves headlong over
very high and huge
precipices?<sup>[78](footnote/fn73.htm#P7360_2323615.md)</sup>

28\. Can any man, who has accepted the first principles even of reason,
be found to mar or dishonour the unchanging nature of Deity with morals
so vile? to credit the gods with natures such as human kindness has
often charmed away and moderated in the beasts of the field?
How,<sup>[79](footnote/fn73.htm#P7362_2324008.md)</sup> I ask, can it be
said that the gods are far removed from any feeling of passion? that
they are gentle, lovers of peace, mild? that in the completeness of
their excellence they
reach<sup>[80](footnote/fn73.htm#P7363_2324247.md)</sup> the i height of
perfection, and the highest wisdom also? or, why should we pray them to
avert from us misfortunes and calamities, if we find that they are
themselves the authors of all the ills by which we are daily harassed?
Call us impious as much as you please, contemners of religion, or
atheists, you will never make us believe in gods of love and war, that
there are gods to sow strife, and to disturb the mind by the stings of
the furies. For either they are gods in very truth, and do not do what
you have related; or if<sup>[81](footnote/fn73.htm#P7364_2324795.md)</sup>
they do the things which you say, they are doubtless no gods *at all*.

29\. We might, however, even yet be able to receive from you these
thoughts, most full of wicked falsehoods, if it were not that you
yourselves, in bringing forward many things about the gods so
inconsistent and mutually destructive, compel us to withhold our minds
from assenting. For when you strive individually to excel each other in
reputation for more recondite knowledge, you both overthrow the very
gods in whom you believe, and replace them by others who have clearly no
existence; and different men give different opinions on the same
subjects,<sup>[82](footnote/fn73.htm#P7366_2325467.md)</sup> and you write
that those whom general consent has ever received as single persons are
infinite in number. Let us, too, begin duty, then, with father Janus,
whom certain of you have declared to be the world, others the year, some
the sun. But if we are to believe that this is true, it follows as a
consequence, that it should be understood that there never was any
Janus, who, they say, being sprung from Coelus and Hecate, reigned first
in Italy, founded the town Janiculum, was the father of
Forts,<sup>[83](footnote/fn73.htm#P7367_2326091.md)</sup> the son-in-law of
Vulturnus, the husband of Juturna; and thus you erase the name of the
god to whom in all prayers you give the first place, and whom you
believe to procure for you a hearing from the gods. But, again, if Janus
be the year, neither thus can he be a god. For who does not know that
the year is a fixed
space<sup>[84](footnote/fn73.htm#P7368_2326481.md)</sup> of time, and that
there is nothing divine in that which is
formed<sup>[85](footnote/fn73.htm#P7369_2326569.md)</sup> by the duration
of months and lapse of days? Now this very *argument* may, in like
manner, be applied to Saturn. For if time is meant under this title, as
the expounders of Grecian ideas think, so that that is regarded as
Kronos,<sup>[86](footnote/fn73.htm#P7370_2326820.md)</sup> which is
chronos,<sup>[87](footnote/fn73.htm#P7371_2326858.md)</sup> there is no
such deity as Saturn. For who is so senseless as to say that time is a
god, when it is but a certain space measured
off<sup>[88](footnote/fn73.htm#P7372_2327007.md)</sup> in the unending
succession of eternity? And thus will be removed from the rank of the
immortals that deity too, whom the men of old declared, and handed down
to their posterity, to be born of father Coelus, the progenitor of the
dii magni, the planter of the vine, the bearer of the
pruning-knife.<sup>[89](footnote/fn73.htm#P7373_2327369.md)</sup>

30\. But what shall we say of Jove himself, whom the wise have
repeatedly asserted to be the sun, driving a winged chariot, followed by
a crowd of deities;<sup>[90](footnote/fn73.htm#P7375_2327541.md)</sup>
some, the ether, blazing with mighty flames, and wasting fire which
cannot be extinguished? Now if this is clear and certain, there is,
then, according to you, no Jupiter at all; who, born of Saturn his
father and Ops his mother, is reported to have been concealed in the
Cretan territory, that he might escape his father's rage. But now, does
not a similar mode of thought remove Juno from the list of gods? For if
she is the air, as you have been wont to jest and say, repeating in
reversed order the *syllables* of the Greek
name,<sup>[91](footnote/fn73.htm#P7376_2328110.md)</sup> there will be
found no sister and spouse of almighty Jupiter, no
Fluonia,<sup>[92](footnote/fn73.htm#P7377_2328283.md)</sup> no Pomona, no
Ossipagina, no Februtis, Populonia, Cinxia, Caprotina; and thus the
invention of that name, spread abroad with a frequent but
vain<sup>[93](footnote/fn73.htm#P7378_2328458.md)</sup> belief, will be
found to be wholly<sup>[94](footnote/fn73.htm#P7379_2328549.md)</sup>
useless.

31\. Aristotle, a man of most powerful intellect, and distinguished for
learning, as Granius tells, shows by plausible arguments that Minerva is
the moon, and proves it by the authority of learned men. Others have
said that this very goddess is the depth of ether, and utmost height;
some *have maintained* that she is memory, whence her name even,
Minerva, has arisen, as if she were some goddess of memory. But if this
is credited, it follows that there is no daughter of Mens, no daughter
of Victory, no discoverer of the Olive, born from the head of Jupiter,
no *goddess* skilled in the knowledge of the arts, and in different
branches of learning. Neptune, they say, has received his name and title
because he covers the earth with water. If, then, by the use of this
name is meant the outspread water, there is no god Neptune at all; and
thus is put away, and removed *from us*, the full brother of Pluto and
Jupiter, armed with the iron trident, lord of the fish, great and small,
king of the depths of the sea, and shaker of the trembling
earth.<sup>[95](footnote/fn73.htm#P7381_2329623.md)</sup>

32\. Mercury, also, has been named as though he were a kind of
go-between; and because conversation passes between two speakers, and is
exchanged by them, that which is expressed by this name has been
produced.<sup>[96](footnote/fn73.htm#P7383_2329878.md)</sup> If this, then,
is the case, Mercury is not the name of a god, but of speech and words
exchanged *by two persons*; and in this way is blotted out and
annihilated the noted Cyllenian bearer of the caduceus, born on the cold
mountain top,<sup>[97](footnote/fn73.htm#P7384_2330169.md)</sup> contriver
of words and names, *the god* who presides over markets, and over the
exchange of goods and commercial intercourse. Some of you have said that
the earth is the Great
Mother,<sup>[98](footnote/fn73.htm#P7385_2330453.md)</sup> because it
provides all things living with food; others declare that the same
*earth* is Ceres, because it brings forth crops of useful
fruits;<sup>[99](footnote/fn73.htm#P7386_2330638.md)</sup> while some
maintain that it is Vesta, because it alone in the universe is at rest,
its other members being, by their constitution, ever in motion. Now if
this is propounded and maintained on sure grounds, in like manner, on
your interpretation, three deities have no existence: neither Ceres nor
Vesta are to be reckoned in the
number<sup>[100](footnote/fn73.htm#P7387_2330994.md)</sup> of the gods;
nor, in fine, can the mother of the gods herself, whom Nigidius thinks
to have been married to Saturn, be rightly declared a goddess, if indeed
these are all names of the one earth, and it alone is signified by these
titles.

33\. We here leave Vulcan unnoticed, to avoid prolixity; whom you all
declare to be fire, with one consenting voice. *We pass by* Venus, named
because *lust* assails all, and Proserpina, named because plants steal
gradually forth into the light,-where, again, you do away with three
deities; if indeed the first is the name of an element, and does not
signify a living power; the second, of a desire common to all living
creatures; while the third refers to seeds rising above ground, and the
upward movements<sup>[101](footnote/fn73.htm#P7389_2331770.md)</sup> of
growing crops. What! when you maintain that Bacchus, Apollo, the Sun,
are one deity, increased in number by the use of three names, is not the
number of the gods lessened, and their vaunted reputation overthrown, by
your opinions? For if it is true that the sun is also Bacchus and
Apollo, there can consequently be in the universe no Apollo or Bacchus;
and thus, by yourselves, the son of Semele *and* the Pythian god are
blotted out *and* set aside,-one the giver of drunken merriment, the
other the destroyer of Sminthian mice.

34\. Some of your learned
men<sup>[102](footnote/fn73.htm#P7391_2332353.md)</sup> -men, too, who do
not chatter *merely* because their humour leads them-maintain that
Diana, Ceres, Luna, are but one deity in triple
union;<sup>[103](footnote/fn73.htm#P7392_2332670.md)</sup> and that there
are not three distinct persons, as there are three different names; that
in all these Luna is invoked, and that the others are a series of
surnames added to her name. But if this is sure, if this is certain, and
the facts of the case show it to be so, again is Ceres but an empty
name, and Diana: and thus the discussion is brought to this issue, that
you lead and advise us to believe that she whom you maintain to be the
discoverer of the earth's fruits has no existence, and Apollo is robbed
of his sister, whom once the horned
hunter<sup>[104](footnote/fn73.htm#P7393_2333296.md)</sup> gazed upon as
she washed her limbs from impurity in a pool, and paid the penalty of
his curiosity.

35\. Men worthy to be remembered in the study of philosophy, who have
been raised by your praises to its highest place, declare, with
commendable earnestness, as their conclusion, that the whole mass of the
world, by whose folds we all are encompassed, covered, and upheld, is
one animal<sup>[105](footnote/fn73.htm#P7395_2333697.md)</sup> possessed of
wisdom and reason; yet if this is a true, sure, and certain
opinion,<sup>[106](footnote/fn73.htm#P7396_2333813.md)</sup> they also will
forthwith cease to be gods whom you set up a little ago in its parts
without change of name.<sup>[107](footnote/fn73.htm#P7397_2333983.md)</sup>
For as one man cannot, while his body remains entire, be divided into
many men; nor can many men, while they continue to be distinct and
separate from each
other,<sup>[108](footnote/fn73.htm#P7398_2334246.md)</sup> be fused into
one sentient individual: so, if the world is a single animal, and moves
from the impulse of one mind, neither can it be dispersed in several
deities; nor, if the gods are parts of it, can they be brought together
and changed into one living creature, with unity of feeling throughout
all its parts. The moon, the sun, the earth, the ether, the stars, are
members and parts of the world; but if they are parts and members, they
are certainly not
themselves<sup>[109](footnote/fn73.htm#P7399_2334937.md)</sup> living
creatures; for in no thing can parts be the very thing which the whole
is, or think and feel for themselves, for this cannot be effected by
their own actions, without the whole creature's joining in; and this
being established and settled, the whole matter comes back to this, that
neither Sol, nor Luna, nor *Aether*, Tellus, and the rest, are gods. For
they are parts of the world, not the proper names of deities; and thus
it is brought about that, by your disturbing and confusing all divine
things, the world is set up as the sole god in the universe, while all
the rest are cast aside, and that as having been set up vainly,
uselessly, and without any reality.

36\. If we sought to subvert the belief in your gods in so many ways, by
so many arguments, no one would doubt that, mad with rage and fury, you
would demand for us the stake, the beasts, and swords, with the other
kinds of torture by which you usually appease your thirst in its intense
craving for our blood. But while you yourselves put away almost the
whole race of deities with a pretence of cleverness and wisdom, you do
not hesitate to assert that, because of us, men suffer ill at the hands
of the gods;<sup>[110](footnote/fn74.htm#P7401_2336153.md)</sup> although,
indeed, if it is true that they anywhere exist, and burn with anger
and<sup>[111](footnote/fn74.htm#P7402_2336310.md)</sup> rage, there can be
no better reason for their showing anger against
you,<sup>[112](footnote/fn74.htm#P7403_2336419.md)</sup> than that you deny
their existence, and *say* that they are not *found* in any part of the
universe.

37\. We are told by Mnaseas that the Muses are the daughters of Tellus
and Coelus; others declare *that they are* Jove's by his wife Memory, or
Mens; some relate that they were virgins, others that they were matrons.
For now we wish to touch briefly on the points where you are shown, from
the difference of your opinions, to make different statements about the
same thing. Ephorus, then, says that they are
three<sup>[113](footnote/fn74.htm#P7405_2336980.md)</sup> in number;
Mnaseas, whom we mentioned, *that they are
four*;<sup>[114](footnote/fn74.htm#P7406_2337149.md)</sup>
Myrtilus<sup>[115](footnote/fn74.htm#P7407_2337315.md)</sup> brings forward
seven; Crates asserts that there are eight; finally Hesiod, enriching
heaven and the stars with gods, comes forward with nine
names.<sup>[116](footnote/fn74.htm#P7408_2337619.md)</sup>

If we are not mistaken, such want of agreement marks those who are
wholly ignorant of the truth, and does not spring from the real state of
the case. For if their number were clearly known, the voice of all would
be the same, and the agreement of all would tend to and find issue in
the same conclusion.<sup>[117](footnote/fn74.htm#P7410_2338047.md)</sup>

38\. How, then, can you give to religion its whole power, when you fill
into error about the gods themselves? or summon us to their solemn
worship, while you give us no definite information how to conceive of
the deities themselves? For, to take no notice of the
other<sup>[118](footnote/fn74.htm#P7412_2338364.md)</sup> authors, either
the first<sup>[119](footnote/fn74.htm#P7413_2338436.md)</sup> makes away
with and destroys six divine Muses, if they are certainly nine; or the
last<sup>[120](footnote/fn74.htm#P7414_2338545.md)</sup> adds six who have
no existence to the three who alone really are; so that it cannot be
known or understood what should be added, what taken away; and in the
performance of religious rites we are in
danger<sup>[121](footnote/fn74.htm#P7415_2338771.md)</sup> of either
worshipping that which does not exist, or passing that by which, it may
be, does exist. Piso believes that the Novensiles are nine gods, set up
among the Sabines at
Trebia.<sup>[122](footnote/fn74.htm#P7416_2339037.md)</sup> Granius thinks
that they are the Muses, agreeing with Aelius; Varro teaches that they
are nine,<sup>[123](footnote/fn74.htm#P7417_2339160.md)</sup> because, in
doing anything, *that number* is always reputed most powerful and
greatest; Cornificius,<sup>[124](footnote/fn74.htm#P7418_2339393.md)</sup>
that they watch over the renewing of
things,<sup>[125](footnote/fn74.htm#P7419_2339543.md)</sup> because, by
their care, all things are afresh renewed in strength, and endure;
Manilius, that they are the nine gods to whom alone Jupiter gave power
to wield his thunder.<sup>[126](footnote/fn74.htm#P7420_2339733.md)</sup>
Cincius declares them to be deities brought from abroad, named from
their very newness, because the Romans were in the habit of sometimes
individually introducing into their families the
rites<sup>[127](footnote/fn74.htm#P7421_2340165.md)</sup> of conquered
cities, while some they publicly consecrated; and lest, from their great
number, or in ignorance, any god should be passed by, all alike were
briefly and compendiously invoked under one name-Novensiles.

39\. There are some, besides, who assert that those who from being men
became gods, are denoted by this name,-as Hercules, Romulus,
*Aeculapius*, Liber, *Aeneas*. These are all, as is clear, different
opinions; and it cannot be, in the nature of things, that those who
differ in opinion can be regarded as teachers of one truth. For if
Piso's opinion is true, *Aelius* and Granius say what is false; if what
they say is certain, Varro, with all his
skill,<sup>[128](footnote/fn74.htm#P7423_2340882.md)</sup> is mistaken, who
substitutes things most frivolous and vain for those which really exist.
If they are named Novensiles because their number is
nine,<sup>[129](footnote/fn74.htm#P7424_2341064.md)</sup> Cornificius is
shown to stumble, who, giving them might and power not their own, makes
them the divine overseers of
renovation.<sup>[130](footnote/fn74.htm#P7425_2341253.md)</sup> But if
Cornificius is right in his belief, Cincius is found *to be* not wise,
who connects with the power of the *dii Novensiles* the gods of
conquered cities. But if they are those whom Cincius asserts *them to
be*, Manilius will be found to speak falsely, who comprehends those who
wield another's thunder under this
name.<sup>[131](footnote/fn74.htm#P7426_2341638.md)</sup> But if that which
Manilius holds is true and certain, they are utterly mistaken who
suppose that those raised to divine honours, and deified mortals, are
*thus* named because of the novelty of their rank. But if the Novensiles
are those who have deserved to be raised to the stars after passing
through the life of
men,<sup>[132](footnote/fn74.htm#P7427_2341995.md)</sup> there are no *dii
Novensiles* at all. For as slaves, soldiers, masters, are not names of
persons comprehended under
them,<sup>[133](footnote/fn74.htm#P7428_2342241.md)</sup> but of officers,
ranks, and duties, so, when we say that Novensiles is the
name<sup>[134](footnote/fn74.htm#P7429_2342349.md)</sup> of gods who by
their virtues have
become<sup>[135](footnote/fn74.htm#P7430_2342480.md)</sup> gods from being
men, it is clear and evident that no individual persons are marked out
particularly, but that newness itself is named by the title Novensiles.

40\. Nigidius taught that the *dii Penates* were Neptune and Apollo, who
once, on fixed terms, girt
Ilium<sup>[136](footnote/fn74.htm#P7432_2342783.md)</sup> with walls. He
himself again, in his sixteenth book, following Etruscan *teaching*,
shows that there are four kinds of Penates; and that one of these
pertains to Jupiter, another to Neptune, the third to the shades below,
the fourth to mortal men, making some unintelligible assertion. Caesius
himself, also, following this teaching, thinks that they are Fortune,
and Ceres, the genius
Jovialis,<sup>[137](footnote/fn74.htm#P7433_2343246.md)</sup> and Pales,
but not the female *deity* commonly
received,<sup>[138](footnote/fn74.htm#P7434_2343459.md)</sup> but some male
attendant and steward of Jupiter. Varro thinks that they are the gods of
whom we speak who are within, and in the inmost recesses of heaven, and
that neither their number nor names are known. The Etruscans say that
these are the *Consentes and
Complices*,<sup>[139](footnote/fn74.htm#P7435_2343772.md)</sup> and name
them because they rise and fall together, six of them being male, and as
many female, with unknown names and pitiless
dispositions,<sup>[140](footnote/fn74.htm#P7436_2344856.md)</sup> but they
are considered the counsellors and princes of Jove supreme. There were
some, too, who said that Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva were the *dii
Penates*, without whom we cannot live and be wise, and by whom we are
ruled within in reason, passion, and thought. As you see, even here,
too, nothing is said harmoniously, nothing is settled with the consent
of all, nor is there anything reliable on which the mind can take its
stand, drawing by conjecture very near to the truth. For their opinions
are so doubtful, and one supposition so
discredited<sup>[141](footnote/fn74.htm#P7437_2345667.md)</sup> by another,
that there is either no truth in them all, or if it is uttered by any,
it is not recognised amid so many different statements.

41\. We can, if it is thought proper, speak briefly of the Lares also,
whom the mass think to be the gods of streets and ways, because the
Greeks name streets *laurae*. In different parts of his writings,
Nigidius *speaks of them* now as the guardians of houses and dwellings;
now as the Curetes, who are said to have once concealed, by the clashing
of cymbals,<sup>[142](footnote/fn74.htm#P7439_2346204.md)</sup> the
infantile cries of Jupiter; now the five Digiti Samothracii, who, the
Greeks tell *us*, were named *Idoei Dactyli*. Varro, with like
hesitation, says at one time that they are the
Manes,<sup>[143](footnote/fn74.htm#P7440_2346435.md)</sup> and therefore
the mother of the Lares was named Mania; at another time, again, he
maintains that they are gods of the air, and are termed heroes; at
another, following the opinion of the ancients, he says that the Lares
are ghosts, as it were a kind of tutelary demon, spirits of
dead<sup>[144](footnote/fn74.htm#P7441_2346810.md)</sup> men.

42\. It is a vast and endless task to examine each kind separately, and
make it evident even from your religious books that you neither hold nor
believe that there is any god concerning whom you have
not<sup>[145](footnote/fn74.htm#P7443_2347145.md)</sup> brought forward
doubtful and inconsistent statements, expressing a thousand different
beliefs. But, to be brief, and avoid
prolixity,<sup>[146](footnote/fn74.htm#P7444_2347318.md)</sup> it is enough
to have said what has been said; it is, further, too troublesome to
gather together many things into one mass, since it is made manifest and
evident in different ways that you waver, and say nothing with certainty
of these things which you assert. But you will perhaps say, Even if we
have no personal knowledge of the Lares, Novensiles, Penates, still the
very agreement of our authors proves their existence, and that such a
race<sup>[147](footnote/fn74.htm#P7445_2347799.md)</sup> takes rank among
the celestial gods. And how can it be known whether there is any god, if
what he is shall be wholly
unknown?<sup>[148](footnote/fn74.htm#P7446_2347964.md)</sup> or how can it
avail even to ask for benefits, if it is not settled and determined who
should be invoked at each
inquiry?<sup>[149](footnote/fn74.htm#P7447_2348124.md)</sup> For every one
who seeks to obtain an answer from any deity, should of necessity know
to whom he makes supplication, on whom he calls, from whom he asks help
for the affairs and occasions of human life; especially as you
yourselves declare that all the gods do not have all power,
and<sup>[150](footnote/fn74.htm#P7448_2348503.md)</sup> that the wrath and
anger of each are appeased by different rites.

43\. For if this
*deity*<sup>[151](footnote/fn74.htm#P7450_2348615.md)</sup> requires a
black, that<sup>[152](footnote/fn74.htm#P7451_2348661.md)</sup> a white
skin; *if* sacrifice must be made to this one with veiled, to that with
uncovered head;<sup>[153](footnote/fn74.htm#P7452_2348778.md)</sup> this
one is consulted about
marriages,<sup>[154](footnote/fn74.htm#P7453_2348864.md)</sup> the other
relieves distresses,-may it not be of some importance whether the one or
the other is Novensills, since ignorance of the facts and confusion of
persons displeases the gods, and leads necessarily to the contraction of
guilt? For suppose that I myself, to avoid some inconvenience and peril,
make supplication to any one of these deities, saying, Be present, be
near, divine Penates, thou Apollo, and thou, O Neptune, and in your
divine clemency turn away all these evils, by which I am
annoyed,<sup>[155](footnote/fn74.htm#P7454_2349383.md)</sup> troubled, and
tormented: will there be any hope that I shall receive help from them,
if Ceres, Pales, Fortune, or the *genius
Jovialis*,<sup>[156](footnote/fn74.htm#P7455_2349648.md)</sup> not Neptune
and Apollo, shall be the *dii Penates*? Or if I invoked the Curetes
instead of the Lares, whom some of your writers maintain to he the
*Digiti Samothracii*, how shall I enjoy their help and favour, when I
have not given them their own names, and *have* given to the others
names not their own? Thus does our interest demand that we should
rightly know the gods, and not hesitate or doubt about the power, the
name of each; lest,<sup>[157](footnote/fn74.htm#P7456_2350485.md)</sup> if
they be invoked with rites and titles not their own, they have at once
their ears stopped *against our prayers*, and hold us involved in guilt
which may not be forgiven.

44\. Wherefore, if you are assured that in the lofty palaces of heaven
there dwells, there is, that multitude of deities whom you specify, you
should make your stand on one
proposition,<sup>[158](footnote/fn74.htm#P7458_2350939.md)</sup> and not,
divided by different and inconsistent opinions, destroy belief in the
very things which you seek to establish. If there is a Janus, let Janus
be; if a Bacchus, let Bacchus be; if a
Summanus,<sup>[159](footnote/fn74.htm#P7459_2351206.md)</sup> let Summanus
be: for this is to confide, this to hold, to be settled in the knowledge
of something ascertained, not to say after the manner of the blind and
erring, The Novensiles are the Muses, in truth they are the Trebian
gods, nay, their number is nine, or rather, they are the protectors of
cities which have been overthrown; and bring so important matters into
this danger, that while you remove some, and put others in their place,
it may well be doubted of them all if they anywhere exist.
