##  TRANSLATOR'S BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.

\[a.d. 170-233-251.\] Alexander was at first bishop of a church in
Cappadocia, but on his visiting Jerusalem he was appointed to the
bishopric of the church there, while the previous bishop Narcissus was
alive, in consequence of a vision which was believed to be
divine.<sup>[1](footnote/fn27.htm#P2715_731056)</sup> During the Decian
persecution he was thrown into prison at Caesarea, and died
there,<sup>[2](footnote/fn27.htm#P2716_731201)</sup> a.d. 251. The only
