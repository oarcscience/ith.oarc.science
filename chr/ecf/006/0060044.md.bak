##  Note by the American Editor.

Frequent references to *Gallandi*, whose collection I have been unable
to inspect, the cost of the best edition being about two hundred
dollars, makes it worth while to insert here, from a London
book-catalogue, the following useful memoranda: "*Gallandii, Cong.
Oral*. (Andr.) Bibliotheca Veterum Patrum Antiquorumque Scriptorum
Ecclesiasticorum Graeco-Latina; Opera silicet eorundum minors ac rariora
usque ad xiii. Saeculum complexa, quorum clxxx. et amplius nec in Veteri
Parisiensi, neque in postrema Lugdunensi edits sunt. Venet., 1765.

"The contents are given in Darling, col. 298-306. Of the three hundred
and eighty-nine writers enumerated, it appears that nearly two hundred
are not in the earlier collections.

"The contents of these great collections are, not the works of the Great
Fathers, of whose writings separate editions have been published, but
the works, often extensive and important, of those numerous
Ecclesiastical writers whose works go, with the Greater Fathers referred
to, to make up the sum of Church Patristic literature."
