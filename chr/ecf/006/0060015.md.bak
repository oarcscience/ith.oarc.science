##  Elucidations.

(The minister to the Gentiles, p. 43.)

If St. Peter had been at Rome, St. Paul would not have come there (2
Cor. x. 16). The two apostles had each his jurisdiction, and they kept
to their own "line of things" respectively. How, then, came St. Peter to
visit Rome? The answer is clear: unless he came involuntarily, as a
prisoner, he came to look after the Church of the
*Circumcision*,<sup>[102](footnote/fn8.htm#P870_239939.md)</sup> which was
"in his measure; "and doubtless St. Paul urged him to this, the Hebrew
Christians there being so large a proportion of the Church. St. Peter
came "at the close of his life," doubtless attended by an apostolic
companion, as St. Paul was, and Barnabas also (Acts xv. 39, 40). Linus
probably laboured for St. Paul (in prison) among the Gentile
Romans,<sup>[103](footnote/fn8.htm#P871_240360.md)</sup> and Cletus for St.
Peter among Jewish Christians. St. Peter *survived all his martyred
associates*, and left Clement in charge of the whole Church. This most
probable theory squares with all known facts, and reconciles all
difficulties. Clement, then, was first bishop of Rome (a.d. 65); and so
says Tertullian, .

That compendious but superficial little work, Smith's *History of the
First Ten Centuries*,<sup>[104](footnote/fn8.htm#P873_240783.md)</sup>
justly censures as "misleading" the usage, which it yet keeps up, of
calling the early bishops of Rome
"Popes."<sup>[105](footnote/fn8.htm#P874_240944.md)</sup> The same author
utterly misunderstands Cyprian's references to Rome as "a principal
*cathedra*," "a root and *matrix*," etc.; importing into the indefinite
Latin a *definite article*. Cyprian applies a similar principle, after
his master Tertullian (vol. iii. p. 260, this series), to all the
Apostolic Sees, the *matrices* of Christian churches.
