##  A Sectional Confession of Faith.<sup>[1](footnote/fn6.md)</sup>

--------

I.

Most hostile and alien to the Apostolic Confession are those who speak
of the Son as assumed to Himself by the Father out of nothing, and from
an emanational origin;<sup>[2](footnote/fn6.htm#P694_204272.md)</sup> and
those who hold the same sentiments with respect to the Holy Spirit;
those who say that the Son is constituted divine by gift and grace, and
that the Holy Spirit is made holy; those who regard the name of the Son
as one common to servants, and assert that thus He is the first-born of
the creature, as becoming, like the creature, existent out of
non-existence, and as being first made, and who refuse to admit that He
is the only-begotten Son,-the only One that the Father has, and that He
has given Himself to be reckoned in the number of mortals, and is thus
reckoned first-born; those who circumscribe the generation of the Son by
the Father with a measured interval after the fashion of man, and refuse
to acknowledge that the aeon of the Begetter and that of the Begotten
are without beginning; those who introduce three separate and diverse
systems of divine worship,<sup>[3](footnote/fn6.htm#P695_205281.md)</sup>
whereas there is but one form of legitimate service which we have
received of old from the law and the prophets, and which has been
confirmed by the Lord and preached by the apostles. Nor less alienated
from the true confession are those who hold not the doctrine of the
Trinity according to truth, as a relation consisting of three persons,
but impiously conceive it as implying a triple being in a unity (Monad),
formed in the way of
synthesis<sup>[4](footnote/fn6.htm#P696_205780.md)</sup> and think that the
Son is the wisdom in God, in the same manner as the human wisdom
subsists in man whereby the man is wise, and represent the Word as being
simply like the word which we utter or conceive, without any hypostasis
whatever.

II.

But the Church's Confession, and the Creed that brings salvation to the
world, is that which deals with the incarnation of the Word, and bears
that He gave Himself over to the flesh of man which He acquired of Mary,
while yet He conserved His own identity, and sustained no divine
transposition or mutation, but was brought into conjunction with the
flesh after the similitude of man; so that the flesh was made one with
the divinity, the divinity having assumed the capacity of receiving the
flesh in the fulfilling of the mystery. And after the dissolution of
death there remained to the holy flesh a perpetual impassibility and a
changeless immortality, man's original glory being taken up into it
again by the power of the divinity, and being ministered then to all men
by the appropriation of faith.<sup>[5](footnote/fn7.md)</sup>

III.

If, then, there are any here, too, who falsify the holy faith, either by
attributing to the divinity as its own what belongs to the
humanity-progressions,<sup>[6](footnote/fn7.htm#P704_207073.md)</sup> and
passions, and a glory coming with
accession<sup>[7](footnote/fn7.htm#P705_207135.md)</sup> -or by separating
from the divinity the progressive and passible body, as if subsisted of
itself apart,-these persons also are outside the confession of the
Church and of salvation. No one, therefore, can know God unless he
apprehends the Son; for the Son is the wisdom by whose instrumentality
all things have been created; and these created objects declare this
wisdom, and God is recognised in the wisdom. But the wisdom of God is
not anything similar to the wisdom which man possesses, but it is the
perfect wisdom which proceeds from the perfect God, and abides for ever,
not like the thought of man, which passes from him in the word that is
spoken and (straightway) ceases to be. Wherefore it is not wisdom only,
but also God; nor is it Word only, but also Son. And whether, then, one
discerns God through creation, or is taught to know Him by the Holy
Scriptures, it is impossible either to apprehend Him or to learn of Him
apart from His wisdom. And he who calls upon God rightly, calls on Him
through the Son; and he who approaches Him in a true fellowship, comes
to Him through Christ. Moreover, the Son Himself cannot be approached
apart from the Spirit. For the Spirit is both the life and the holy
formation of all things;<sup>[8](footnote/fn7.htm#P706_208404.md)</sup> and
God sending forth this Spirit through the Son makes the
creature<sup>[9](footnote/fn7.htm#P707_208497.md)</sup> like Himself.

IV.

One therefore is God the Father, one the Word, one the Spirit, the life,
the sanctification of all. And neither is there another God as
Father,<sup>[10](footnote/fn7.htm#P711_208674.md)</sup> nor is there
another Son as Word of God, nor is there another Spirit as quickening
and sanctifying. Further, although the saints are called both gods, and
sons, and spirits, they are neither filled with the Spirit, nor are made
like the Son and God. And if, then, any one makes this affirmation, that
the Son is God, simply as being Himself filled with divinity, and not as
being generated of divinity, he has belied the Word, he has belied the
Wisdom, he has lost the knowledge of God; he has fallen away into the
worship of the creature, he has taken up the impiety of the Greeks, to
that he has gone back; and he has become a follower of the unbelief of
the Jews, who, supposing the Word of God to be but a human son, have
refused to accept Him as God, and have declined to acknowledge Him as
the Son of God. But it is impious to think of the Word of God as merely
human, and to think of the works which are done by Him as abiding, while
He abides not Himself. And if any one says that the Christ works all
things only as commanded by the Word, he will both make the Word of God
idle,<sup>[11](footnote/fn7.htm#P712_209799.md)</sup> and will change the
Lord's order into servitude. For the slave is one altogether under
command, and the created is not competent to create; for to suppose that
what is itself created may in like manner create other things, would
imply that it has ceased to be like the
creature.<sup>[12](footnote/fn7.htm#P713_210092.md)</sup>

V.

Again, when one speaks of the Holy Spirit as an object made
holy,<sup>[13](footnote/fn7.htm#P717_210343.md)</sup> he will no longer be
able to apprehend all things as being sanctified in (the) Spirit. For he
who has sanctified one, sanctifies all things. That man, consequently,
belies the fountain of sanctification, the Holy Spirit, who denudes Him
of the power of sanctifying, and he will thus be precluded from
numbering Him with the Father and the Son; he makes nought, too, of the
holy (ordinance of) baptism, and will no more be able to acknowledge the
holy and august Trinity.<sup>[14](footnote/fn7.htm#P718_210841.md)</sup>
For either we must apprehend the perfect
Trinity<sup>[15](footnote/fn7.htm#P719_210925.md)</sup> in its natural and
genuine glory, or we shall be under the necessity of speaking no more of
a Trinity, but only of a
Unity;<sup>[16](footnote/fn7.htm#P720_211084.md)</sup> or else, not
numbering<sup>[17](footnote/fn7.htm#P721_211119.md)</sup> created objects
with the Creator, nor the creatures with the Lord of all, we mast also
not number what is sanctified with what sanctifies; even as no object
that is made can be numbered with the Trinity, but in the name of the
Holy Trinity baptism and invocation and worship are administered. For if
there are three several glories, there must also be three several forms
of cultus with those who impiously worship the creature; for if there is
a distinction in the nature of the objects worshipped, there ought to be
also with these men a distinction in the nature of the worship offered.
What is recent<sup>[18](footnote/fn7.htm#P722_211743.md)</sup> surely is
not to be worshipped along with what is eternal; for the recent
comprehends all that has had a beginning, while mighty and measureless
is lie who is before the ages. He, therefore, who supposes some
beginning of times in the life of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
therewith also cuts off any possibility of numbering the Son and the
Spirit with the Father. For as we acknowledge the glory to be one, so
ought we also to acknowledge the substance in the Godhead to be one, and
one also the eternity of the Trinity.

VI.

Moreover, the capital clement of our salvation is the incarnation of the
Word. We believe, therefore, that it was without any change in the
Divinity that the incarnation of the Word took place with a view to the
renewal of humanity. For there took place neither mutation nor
transposition, nor any circumscription in
will,<sup>[19](footnote/fn7.htm#P726_212614.md)</sup> as regards the holy
energy<sup>[20](footnote/fn7.htm#P727_212674.md)</sup> of God; but while
that remained in itself the same, it also effected the work of the
incarnation with a view to the salvation of the world: and the Word of
God, living<sup>[21](footnote/fn7.htm#P728_212857.md)</sup> on earth after
man's fashion, maintained likewise in all the divine presence,
fulfilling all things, and being
united<sup>[22](footnote/fn7.htm#P729_212997.md)</sup> properly and
individually with flesh; and while the sensibilities proper to the flesh
were there, the *divine* energy maintained the impassibility proper to
itself. Impious, therefore, is the man who introduces the
passibility<sup>[23](footnote/fn7.htm#P730_213243.md)</sup> into the
energy. For the Lord of glory appeared in fashion as a man when He
undertook the economy<sup>[24](footnote/fn7.htm#P731_213358.md)</sup> upon
the earth; and He fulfilled the law for men by His deeds, and by His
sufferings He did away with man's sufferings, and by His death He
abolished death, and by his resurrection He brought life to light; and
now we look for His appearing from heaven in glory for the life and
judgment of all, when the resurrection of the dead shall take place, to
the end that recompense may be made to all according to their desert.

VII.

But some treat the Holy
Trinity<sup>[25](footnote/fn7.htm#P735_213925.md)</sup> in an awful manner,
when they confidently assert that there are not three persons, and
introduce (the idea of) a person devoid of
subsistence.<sup>[26](footnote/fn7.htm#P736_214080.md)</sup> Wherefore we
clear ourselves of Sabellius, who says that the Father and the Son are
the same. For he holds that the Father is He who speaks, and that the
Son is the Word that abides in the Father, and becomes manifest at the
time of the creation,<sup>[27](footnote/fn7.htm#P737_214347.md)</sup> and
thereafter reverts to God on the fulfilling of all things. The same
affirmation he makes also of the Spirit. We forswear this, because we
believe that three persons-namely, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-are
declared to possess the one Godhead: for the one divinity showing itself
forth according to nature in the
Trinity<sup>[28](footnote/fn7.htm#P738_214690.md)</sup> establishes the
oneness of the nature; and thus there is a (divinity that is the)
property of the Father, according to the word, "There is one God the
Father; "<sup>[29](footnote/fn7.htm#P739_214892.md)</sup> and there is a
divinity hereditary<sup>[30](footnote/fn7.htm#P740_214948.md)</sup> in the
Son, as it is written, "The Word was God;
"<sup>[31](footnote/fn7.htm#P741_215015.md)</sup> and there is a divinity
present according to nature in the Spirit into wit, what subsists as the
Spirit of God-according to Paul's statement, "Ye are the temple of God,
and the Spirit of God dwelleth in
you."<sup>[32](footnote/fn7.htm#P742_215240.md)</sup>

VIII.

Now the person in each declares the independent being and
subsistence.<sup>[33](footnote/fn7.htm#P746_215336.md)</sup> But divinity
is the property of the Father; and whenever the divinity of these three
is spoken of as one, testimony is borne that the
property<sup>[34](footnote/fn7.htm#P747_215526.md)</sup> of the Father
belongs also to the Son and the Spirit: wherefore, if the divinity may
be spoken of as one in three persons, the trinity is established, and
the unity is not dissevered; and the oneness Which is naturally the
Father's is also acknowledged to be the Son's and the Spirit's. If one,
however, speaks of one person as he may speak of one divinity, it cannot
be that the two in the one are as
one.<sup>[35](footnote/fn7.htm#P748_216028.md)</sup> For Paul addresses the
Father as one in respect of divinity, and speaks of the Son as one in
respect of lordship: "There is one God the Father, of whom are all
things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we by Him."<sup>[36](footnote/fn7.htm#P749_216327.md)</sup>
Wherefore if there is one God, and one Lord, and at the same time one
person as one divinity in one
lordship,<sup>[37](footnote/fn7.htm#P750_216458.md)</sup> how can credit be
given to (this distinction in) the words "of whom" and "by whom," as has
been said before? We speak, accordingly, not as if we separated the
lordship from the divinity, nor as estranging the one from the other,
but as unifying them in the way warranted by actual fact and truth; and
we call the Son God with the property of the
Father,<sup>[38](footnote/fn7.htm#P751_216852.md)</sup> as being His image
and offspring; and we call the Father Lord, addressing Him by the name
of the One Lord, as being His Origin and Begettor.

IX.

The same position we hold respecting the Spirit, who has that unity with
the Son which the Son has with the Father. Wherefore let the hypostasis
of the Father be discriminated by the appellation of God; but let not
the Son be cut off from this appellation, for He is of God. Again, let
the person of the Son also be discriminated by the appellation of Lord;
only let not God be dissociated from that, for He is Lord as being the
Father of the Lord. And as it is proper to the Son to exercise lordship,
for He it is that made (all things) by Himself, and now rules the things
that were made, while at the same time the Father has a prior possession
of that property, inasmuch as He is the Father of Him who is Lord; so we
speak of the Trinity as One God, and yet not as if we made the one by a
synthesis of three: for the subsistence that is constituted by synthesis
is something altogether partitive and
imperfect.<sup>[39](footnote/fn7.htm#P755_217946.md)</sup> But just as the
designation Father is the expression of originality and generation, so
the designation Son is the expression of the image and offspring of the
Father. Hence, if one were to ask how there is but One God, if there is
also a God of God, we would reply that that is a term proper to the idea
of original causation,<sup>[40](footnote/fn7.htm#P756_218334.md)</sup> so
far as the Father is the one First
Cause.<sup>[41](footnote/fn7.htm#P757_218393.md)</sup> And if one were also
to put the question, how there is but One Lord, if the Father also is
Lord, we might answer that again by saying that He is so in so far as He
is the Father of the Lord; and this difficulty shall meet us no longer.

X.

And again, if the impious say, How will there not be three Gods and
three Persons, on the supposition that they have one and the same
divinity?-we shall reply: Just because God is the Cause and Father of
the Son; and this Son is the image and offspring of the Father, and not
His brother; and the Spirit in like manner is the Spirit of God, as it
is written, "God is a
Spirit."<sup>[42](footnote/fn7.htm#P761_219020.md)</sup> And in earlier
times we have this declaration from the prophet David: "By the word of
the Lord were the heavens stablished, and all the power of them by the
breath (spirit) of His
mouth."<sup>[43](footnote/fn7.htm#P762_219226.md)</sup> And in the
beginning of the book of the
creation<sup>[44](footnote/fn7.htm#P763_219295.md)</sup> it is written
thus: "And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters."<sup>[45](footnote/fn7.htm#P764_219393.md)</sup> And Paul in his
Epistle to the Romans says "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the
Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in
you."<sup>[46](footnote/fn7.htm#P765_219548.md)</sup> And again he says:
"But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in
you."<sup>[47](footnote/fn7.htm#P766_219775.md)</sup> And again: "As many
as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have
not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received
the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
Father."<sup>[48](footnote/fn7.htm#P767_220012.md)</sup> And again: "I say
the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in
the Holy Ghost."<sup>[49](footnote/fn7.htm#P768_220144.md)</sup> And again:
"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that
ye may abound in hope, by the power of the Holy
Ghost."<sup>[50](footnote/fn7.htm#P769_220300.md)</sup>

XI.

And again, writing to those same Romans, he says: "But I have written
the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because
of the grace that is given to me of God, that I should be the minister
of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the Gospel of God, that the
offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the
Holy Ghost. I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
those things which pertain to God. For I dare not to speak of any of
those things which Christ hath not wrought by
me,<sup>[51](footnote/fn7.htm#P773_220871.md)</sup> to make the Gentiles
obedient, by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the
power of the Holy Spirit."<sup>[52](footnote/fn7.htm#P774_221234.md)</sup>
And again: "Now I beseech you, brethren, for our Lord Jesus Christ's
sake, and by the love of the
Spirit."<sup>[53](footnote/fn7.htm#P775_221436.md)</sup> And these things,
indeed, are written in the Epistle to the
Romans.<sup>[54](footnote/fn7.htm#P776_221522.md)</sup>

XII.

Again, in the Epistle to the Corinthians he says: "For my speech and my
preaching was not in the enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith should not
stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of
God."<sup>[55](footnote/fn7.htm#P780_221976.md)</sup> And again he says:
"As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
them that love Him. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit:
for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For
what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in
him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
God."<sup>[56](footnote/fn7.htm#P781_222437.md)</sup> And again he says:
"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God."<sup>[57](footnote/fn7.htm#P782_222547.md)</sup>

XIII.

Seest thou that all through Scripture the Spirit is preached, and yet
nowhere named a creature? And what can the impious have to say if the
Lord sends forth His disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit?<sup>[58](footnote/fn7.htm#P786_222822.md)</sup> Without
contradiction, that implies a communion and unity between them,
according to which there are neither three divinities nor (three)
lordships; but, while there remain truly and certainly the three
persons, the real unity of the three must be acknowledged. And in this
way proper credit will be given to the *sending* and the *being
sent*<sup>[59](footnote/fn7.htm#P787_223185)</sup> (in the Godhead.md),
according to which the Father hath sent forth the Son, and the Son in
like manner sends forth the Spirit. For one of the persons surely could
not (be said to) send Himself; and one could not speak of the Father as
incarnate. For the articles of our faith will not concur with the
vicious tenets of the heresies; and it is right that our conceptions
should follow the inspired and apostolic doctrines, and not that our
impotent fancies should coerce the articles of our divine faith.

XIV.

But if they say, How can there be three Persons, and how but one
Divinity?-we shall make this reply: That there are indeed three persons,
inasmuch as there is one person of God the Father, and one of the Lord
the Son, and one of the Holy Spirit; and yet that there is but one
divinity, inasmuch as the Son is the Image of God the Father, who is
One,-that is, He is God of God; and in like manner the Spirit is called
the Spirit of God, and that, too, of nature according to the very
substance,<sup>[60](footnote/fn7.htm#P791_224297.md)</sup> and not
according to simple participation of God. And there is one
substance<sup>[61](footnote/fn7.htm#P792_224415.md)</sup> in the Trinity,
which does not subsist also in the case of objects that are made; for
there is not one substance in God and in the things that are made,
because none of these is in substance God. Nor, indeed, is the Lord one
of these according to substance, but there is one Lord the Son, and one
Holy Spirit; and we speak also of one Divinity, and one Lordship, and
one Sanctity in the Trinity; because the Father is the
Cause<sup>[62](footnote/fn7.htm#P793_224857.md)</sup> of the Lord, having
begotten Him eternally, and the Lord is the
Prototype<sup>[63](footnote/fn7.htm#P794_224944.md)</sup> of the Spirit.
For thus the Father is Lord, and the Son also is God; and of God it is
said that "God is a
Spirit."<sup>[64](footnote/fn7.htm#P795_225077.md)</sup>

XV.

We therefore acknowledge one true God, the one First Cause, and one Son,
very God of very God, possessing of nature the Father's divinity,-that
is to say, being the same in substance with the
Father;<sup>[65](footnote/fn7.htm#P799_225298.md)</sup> and one Holy
Spirit, who by nature and in truth sanctifies all, and makes divine, as
being of the substance of
God.<sup>[66](footnote/fn8.htm#P800_225661.md)</sup> Those who speak either
of the Son or of the Holy Spirit as a creature we anathematize. All
other things we hold to be objects made, and in
subjection,<sup>[67](footnote/fn8.htm#P801_225868.md)</sup> created by God
through the Son, (and) sanctified in the Holy Spirit. Further, we
acknowledge that the Son of God was made a Son of man, having taken to
Himself the flesh from the Virgin Mary, not in name, but in reality; and
that He is both the perfect Son of God, and the (perfect) Son of
man,-that the Person is but one, and that there is one
worship<sup>[68](footnote/fn8.htm#P802_226234.md)</sup> for the Word and
the flesh that He assumed. And we anathematize those who constitute
different worships, one for the divine and another for the human, and
who worship the man born of Mary as though He were another than the God
of God. For we know that "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was
God."<sup>[69](footnote/fn8.htm#P803_226587.md)</sup> And we worship Him
who was made man on account of our salvation, not indeed as made
perfectly like in the like
body,<sup>[70](footnote/fn8.htm#P804_226720.md)</sup> but as the Lord who
has taken to Himself the form of the servant. We acknowledge the passion
of the Lord in the flesh, the resurrection in the power of His divinity,
the ascension to heaven, and His glorious appearing when He comes for
the judgment of the living and the dead, and for the eternal life of the
saints.

XVI.

And since some have given us trouble by attempting to subvert our faith
in our Lord Jesus Christ, and by affirming of Him that He was not God
incarnated, but a man linked with God; for this reason we present our
confession on the subject of the aforementioned matters of faith, and
reject the faithless dogmas opposed thereto. For God, having been
incarnated in the flesh of man, retains also His proper energy pure,
possessing a mind unsubjected by the
natural<sup>[71](footnote/fn8.htm#P808_227547.md)</sup> and fleshly
affections, and holding the flesh and the fleshly motions divinely and
sinlessly, and not only unmastered by the power of death, but even
destroying death. And it is the true God unincarnate that has appeared
incarnate, the perfect One with the genuine and divine perfection; and
in Him there are not two persons. Nor do we affirm that there are four
to worship, viz., God and the Son of God, and man and the Holy Spirit.
Wherefore we also anathematize those who show their impiety in this, and
who thus give the *man* a place in the divine doxology. For we hold that
the Word of God was made man on account of our salvation, in order that
we might receive the likeness of the heavenly, and be made
divine<sup>[72](footnote/fn8.htm#P809_228279.md)</sup> after the likeness
of Him who is the true Son of God by nature, and the Son of man
according to the flesh, our Lord Jesus Christ.

XVII.

We believe therefore in one God, that is, in one First Cause, the God of
the law and of the Gospel, the just and good; and in one Lord Jesus
Christ, true God, that is, Image of the true God, Maker of all things
seen and unseen, Son of God and only-begotten Offspring, and Eternal
Word, living and self-subsistent and
active.<sup>[73](footnote/fn8.htm#P813_228758.md)</sup> always being with
the Father; and in one Holy Spirit; and in the glorious advent of the
Son of God, who of the Virgin Mary took flesh, and endured sufferings
and death in our stead, and came to resurrection on the third day, and
was taken up to heaven; and in His glorious appearing yet to come; and
in one holy Church, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the
flesh, and life eternal.

XVIII.

We acknowledge that the Son and the Spirit are consubstantial with the
Father, and that the substance of the Trinity is one,-that is, that
there is one divinity according to nature, the Father remaining
unbegotten, and the Son being begotten of the Father in a true
generation, and not in a formation by
will,<sup>[74](footnote/fn8.htm#P817_229483.md)</sup> and the Spirit being
sent forth eternally from the substance of the Father through the Son,
with power to sanctify the whole creation. And we further acknowledge
that the Word was made flesh, and was manifested in the
flesh-movement<sup>[75](footnote/fn8.htm#P818_229746.md)</sup> received of
a virgin, and did not simply energize in a man. And those who have
fellowship with men that reject the *consubstantiality* as a doctrine
foreign to the Scriptures, and speak of any of the persons in the
Trinity as created, and separate that person from the one natural
divinity, we hold as aliens, and have fellowship with none
such.<sup>[76](footnote/fn8.htm#P819_230160.md)</sup> There is one God the
Father, and there is only one divinity. But the Son also is God, as
being the true image of the one and only divinity, according to
generation and the nature which He has from the Father. There is one
Lord the Son; but in like manner there is the Spirit, who bears
over<sup>[77](footnote/fn8.htm#P820_230584.md)</sup> the Son's lordship to
the creature that is sanctified. The Son sojourned in the world, having
of the Virgin received flesh, which He filled with the Holy Spirit for
the sanctification of us all; and having given up the flesh to death, He
destroyed death through the resurrection that had in view the
resurrection of us all; and He ascended to heaven, exalting and
glorifying men in Himself; and He comes the second time to bring us
again eternal life.

One is the Son, both before the incarnation and after the incarnation.
The same (Son) is both man and God, both these together as though one;
and the God the Word is not one person, and the man Jesus another
person, but the same who subsisted as Son before was made one with flesh
by Mary, so constituting Himself a perfect, and holy, and sinless man,
and using that economical position for the renewal of mankind and the
salvation of all the world. God the Father, being Himself the perfect
Person, has thus the perfect Word begotten of Him truly. not as a word
that is spoken, nor yet again as a son by adoption, in the sense in
which angels and men are called sons of God, but as a Son who is in
nature God. And there is also the perfect Holy Spirit
supplied<sup>[78](footnote/fn8.htm#P824_231818.md)</sup> of God through the
Son to the sons of adoption, living and life-giving, holy and imparting
holiness to those who partake of Him,-not like an unsubstantial
breath<sup>[79](footnote/fn8.htm#P825_232000.md)</sup> breathed into them
by man, but as the living Breath proceeding from God. Wherefore the
Trinity is to be adored, to be glorified, to be honoured, and to be
reverenced; the Father being apprehended in the Son even as the Son is
of Him, and the Son being glorified in the Father, inasmuch as He is of
the Father, and being manifested in the Holy Spirit to the sanctified.

XX.

And that the holy Trinity is to be worshipped without either separation
or alienation, is taught us by Paul, who says in his Second Epistle to
the Corinthians: "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with yon
all."<sup>[80](footnote/fn8.htm#P829_232657.md)</sup> And again, in that
epistle he makes this explanation: "Now He which stablisheth us with you
in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God, who hath also sealed us, and
given the earnest of the Spirit in our
hearts."<sup>[81](footnote/fn8.htm#P830_232889.md)</sup> And still more
clearly he writes thus in the same epistle: "When Moses is read, the
veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord,
the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face
beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord."<sup>[82](footnote/fn8.htm#P831_233345.md)</sup>

XXI.

And again Paul says: "That mortality might be swallowed up of life. Now
He that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath
given unto us the earnest of the
Spirit."<sup>[83](footnote/fn8.htm#P835_233556.md)</sup> And again he says:
"Approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in
afflictions, in
necessities."<sup>[84](footnote/fn8.htm#P836_233693.md)</sup> and so forth.
Then he adds these words: "By kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love
unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of
God."<sup>[85](footnote/fn8.htm#P837_233848.md)</sup> Behold here again the
saint has defined the holy Trinity, naming God, and the Word, and the
Holy Ghost. And again he says: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of
God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the
temple of God, him shall God
destroy."<sup>[86](footnote/fn8.htm#P838_234142.md)</sup> And again: "But
ye are washed, but ye are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus, and
by the Spirit of our God."<sup>[87](footnote/fn8.htm#P839_234282.md)</sup>
And again: "What! know ye not that your bodies are the temple of the
Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God?
"<sup>[88](footnote/fn8.htm#P840_234423.md)</sup> "And I think also that I
have the Spirit of God."<sup>[89](footnote/fn8.htm#P841_234493.md)</sup>

XXII.

And again, speaking also of the children of Israel as baptized in the
cloud and in the sea, he says: "And they all drank of the same spiritual
drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and
that Rock was Christ."<sup>[90](footnote/fn8.htm#P845_234754.md)</sup> And
again he says: "Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking
by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say
that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities
of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of
administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of
operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the
manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For
to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of
knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the sane Spirit; to
another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working
of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to
another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of
tongues: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
dividing to every man severally as He will. For as the body is one, and
hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are
one body; so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into
one body."<sup>[91](footnote/fn8.htm#P846_235902.md)</sup> And again he
says: "For if he who comes preaches another Christ whom we have not
preached, or ye receive another spirit that ye have received not, or
another gospel which ye have not obtained, ye will rightly be kept
back."<sup>[92](footnote/fn8.htm#P847_236149.md)</sup>

XXIII.

Seest thou that the Spirit is inseparable from the divinity? And no one
with pious apprehensions could fancy that He is a creature. Moreover, in
the Epistle to the Hebrews he writes again thus: "How shall we escape,
if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken
by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God also
bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers
miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost?
"<sup>[93](footnote/fn8.htm#P851_236683.md)</sup> And again he says in the
same epistle: "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Today, if ye will
hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the
day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me,
proved me, and saw my works forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with
that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart;
for<sup>[94](footnote/fn8.htm#P852_237070.md)</sup> they have not known my
ways: as I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my
rest."<sup>[95](footnote/fn8.htm#P853_237178.md)</sup> And there, too, they
ought to give ear to Paul, for he by no means separates the Holy Spirit
from the divinity of the Father and the Son, but clearly sets forth the
discourse of the Holy Ghost as one from the person of the Father, and
thus as given expression to<sup>[96](footnote/fn8.htm#P854_237462.md)</sup>
by God, just as it has been represented in the before-mentioned sayings.
Wherefore the holy Trinity is believed to be one God, in accordance with
these testimonies of Holy Scripture; albeit all through the inspired
Scriptures numberless announcements are supplied us, all confirmatory of
the apostolic and ecclesiastical faith.

To maintain two natures<sup>[98](footnote/fn8.htm#P859_238090.md)</sup> in
the one Christ, makes a Tetrad of the Trinity, says he; for he expressed
himself thus: "And it is the true God, the unincarnate, that was
manifested in the flesh, perfect with the true and divine perfection,
not with two natures; nor do we speak of worshipping four (persons),
viz., God, and the Son of God, and man, and the Holy Spirit." First,
however, this passage is misapprehended, and is of very doubtful import.
Nevertheless it bears that we should not speak of two persons in Christ,
lest, by thus acknowledging Him as God, and as in the perfect divinity,
and yet speaking of two persons, we should make a Tetrad of the divine
persons, counting that of God the Father as one, and that of the Son of
God as one, and that of the man as one, and that of the Holy Spirit as
one. But, again, it bears also against recognising two divine
natures,<sup>[99](footnote/fn8.htm#P860_238956.md)</sup> and rather for
acknowledging Him to be perfect God in one natural divine perfection,
and not in two; for his object is to show that He became incarnate
without change, and that He retains the divinity without
duplication.<sup>[100](footnote/fn8.htm#P861_239193.md)</sup> Accordingly
he says shortly: "And while the affections of the flesh spring, the
energy<sup>[101](footnote/fn8.htm#P862_239304.md)</sup> retains the
impassibility proper to it. He, therefore, who introduces the (idea of)
passion into the energy is impious; for it was the Lord of glory that
appeared in human form, having taken to Himself the human economy."
