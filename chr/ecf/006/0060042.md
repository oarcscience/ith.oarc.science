##  VI.-Of the One Substance.<sup>[1](footnote/fn20.htm#P2072_596401.md)</sup>

------------

The plant that springs from the root is something distinct from that
whence it grows up; and yet it is of one nature with it. And the river
which flows from the fountain is something distinct from the fountain.
For we cannot call either the river a fountain, or the fountain a river.
Nevertheless we allow that they are both one according to nature, and
also one in substance; and we admit that the fountain may be conceived
of as father, and that the river is what is begotten of the
fountain.<sup>[2](footnote/fn20.htm#P2075_597089.md)</sup>
