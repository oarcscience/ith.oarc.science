##  Elucidations.

I

The epistle written by Malchion, p. 169.

Malchion, though a presbyter of Antioch, reflects the teaching of
Alexandria, and illustrates its far-reaching influence. Firmilian,
presiding at the Council of Antioch, was a pupil of Origen; and
Dionysius was felt in the council, though unable to be present. Malchion
and Firmilian, therefore, vindicate the real mind of Origen, though
speaking in language matured and guarded. This council was,
providentially, a rehearsal for Nicaea.

II

Putting a stop to psalms, etc., p. 170.

Coleridge notes this, with an amusing comment on *Paulus
Samosatenus*,<sup>[4](footnote/fn32.htm#P3203_815215)</sup> and refers
to Pliny's letter, of which see vol. v. p. 604, this series. Jeremy
Taylor, from whom Coleridge quotes, gives the passage of our author as
follows: "Psalmos et cantus qui ad Dom. nostri J. C. honorem decantari
solent, tanquam recentiores eta viris recentioris memoriae editos,
exploserit" (*Works, ii*. p. 281, ed. Bohn, 1844). Observe what
Coleridge says elsewhere<sup>[5](footnote/fn32.htm#P3204_816671)</sup>
on errors attributed to Origen: "Never was a great man so misunderstood
as Origen." He adds: "The *caro noumenon* was what Origen meant by
Christ's \`flesh consubstantial with His Godhead.'"
