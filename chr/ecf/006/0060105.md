##  Introductory Notice to Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria.

------------

\[A.D. 273<sup>[1](footnote/fn46.htm#P4638_1380421.md)</sup> -313-326.\]
The records of the Ante-Nicene period, so far as Alexandria is
concerned, are complete in this great primate, the friend and patron of
Athanasius, and, with him, the master-spirit of the great Council of
Nicaea. I have so arranged the "Fragments" of the Edinburgh series in
this volume as to make them a great and important integer in rounding
out and fulfilling the portraiture of the school and the See of
Alexandria. The student will thus have at hand the materials for a
covetable survey of the Alexandrian Fathers,-their history, their
influence, and their immense authority in early Christendom. In an
elucidation<sup>[2](footnote/fn46.htm#P4639_1381086.md)</sup> I venture to
condense my thoughts upon some points which it has been the interest of
unbelievers to misrepresent, and to colour for their own purposes. But,
as the limitations of my editorial duty do not allow me to enter upon a
dissertation, I am thankful to refer the reader to the truly valuable
though by no means exhaustive work of Dr. Neale on *The Patriarchate of
Alexandria*. His statements are not, indeed, to be received with
unreserving confidence; for, in spite of his pure and lofty purposes,
his mind had been formed under the strong bias of a transient fashion in
divinity, and he always surveyed his subject from an Occidental if not
from a Latin (I do not mean a strictly Roman) point of view. To other
popular historians I need not refer the student, save, by anticipation,
to the list of authorities which will be furnished in the concluding
volume of this series.<sup>[3](footnote/fn46.htm#P4640_1381986.md)</sup>

Let us reflect, then, upon the epoch to which we have now come. The
intense sufferings, labours, and intellectual as well as moral
struggles, of the three heroic centuries, are closing, and Alexander of
Alexandria is the grand figure of the period. Diocletian is preparing to
let loose upon the sheep of Christ the ferocious wolves of the tenth
persecution. Lucian is founding the school of
Antioch,<sup>[4](footnote/fn46.htm#P4642_1382532.md)</sup> revising the New
Testament, and, in fact, the whole Bible of the Fathers, for his labours
included the version of the Seventy. Unhappily, the ambitious Arius, who
calls him master, has begun to trouble the evangelical See of St. Mark;
and Achillas, notwithstanding the warnings of Peter, has laid hands upon
him, and made him a presbyter. He aspires to be made a bishop. But anon
a boy is playing on the shore at Alexandria in whom a flaming genius for
the priesthood already manifests itself. Alexander, looking forth from
his windows, sees him "playing church" with his schoolmates, and
actually dipping a young pagan in the sea, "in the name of the Father,"
etc. No doubt something of the kind did occur, and thus was the boy
Athanasius brought to the notice of his bishop. But even Dupin rejects
the rest of the story, that Alexander decided the question of the
boy-baptism in favour of its validity, as the Latins would have us
believe. Anyhow, we have this miracle of precocity attending Alexander
as his deacon at the Council of Nicaea, and then soon after succeeding
to his episcopal chair. Athanasius is the grandest figure of the
primitive ages after the apostles fell asleep. Raised up to complete
their testimony to the eternal Logos, and to suffer like them, we soon
behold him the noble example of constancy against the new perils of the
world's favour and the patronage of the Caesars. "Athanasius *against*
the world" was in two senses his great encomium, and the epitome of his
glorious life and warfare. Not less was it "Athanasius *for* the world."
Alas! the majestic school of Pantaenus and Clement soon after comes to
its enigmatical decline. Some plants, when they have borne their
superlative flower and fruit, mysteriously decay. It was so, alas! with
the great Christian academy that not improbably owes its beginnings to
Apollos.

Translator's Introductory Notice.

Alexander was appointed successor to
Achillas,<sup>[5](footnote/fn46.htm#P4646_1384768.md)</sup> as Bishop of
Alexandria, about A.D. 312. The virtues of this prelate, which Eusebius
has passed over entirely without mention, other ecclesiastical writers
have greatly extolled. For on all sides he is styled "the staunchest
upholder of evangelical doctrine," "the patron and protector of
apostolic doctrine;" and "that bishop of divine faith, full of wisdom
and of zeal enkindled by the Holy Spirit." He was the first to detect
and to condemn Arius;<sup>[6](footnote/fn46.htm#P4647_1385354.md)</sup> and
taking his stand upon passages of Holy Scripture, as Theodoret
remarks,<sup>[7](footnote/fn46.htm#P4648_1385523.md)</sup> he taught that
the Son of God was of one and the same majesty with the Father, and had
the same substance with the Father who begat Him.

At first he sought to bring back Arius from his heresy. But when he
perceived that he openly and obstinately taught his false doctrines, he
assembled a first and then a second synod of the bishops of Egypt, and
degraded him from the order of the
priesthood,<sup>[8](footnote/fn46.htm#P4650_1385933.md)</sup> and cut him
off from the communion of the Church. This proving ineffectual, the
Council of Nicaea was convened, in which he was finally condemned. In
combating the Arian heresy, Alexander endured, although at a great age,
many trials, and died shortly after the holding of the council.
