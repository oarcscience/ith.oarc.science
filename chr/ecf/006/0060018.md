##  Twelve Topics on the Faith.

Wherein is Given Also the Formula of Excommunication, and an Explication
is Subjoined to Each.<sup>[1](footnote/fn9.md)</sup>

--------

If any one says that the body of Christ is uncreated, and refuses to
acknowledge that He, being the uncreated Word (God) of God, took the
flesh of created humanity and appeared incarnate, even as it is written,
let him be anathema.

How could the body be said to be uncreated? For the uncreated is the
passionless, invulnerable, intangible. But Christ, on rising from the
dead, showed His disciples the print of the nails and the wound made by
the spear, and a body that could be handled, although He also had
entered among them when the doors were shut, with the view of showing
them at once the energy of the divinity and the reality of the body.

Yet, while being God, He was recognised as man in a natural manner; and
while subsisting truly as man, He was also manifested as God by His
works.<sup>[2](footnote/fn9.htm#P918_250067.md)</sup>

If any one affirms that the flesh of Christ is consubstantial with the
divinity, and refuses to acknowledge that He, subsisting Himself in the
form of God as God before all ages, emptied Himself and took the form of
a servant, even as it is written, let him be anathema.

How could the flesh, which is conditioned by time, be said to be
consubstantial<sup>[3](footnote/fn9.htm#P925_250491.md)</sup> with the
timeless divinity? For that is designated consubstantial which is the
same in nature and in eternal duration without variableness.

If any one affirms that Christ, just like one of the prophets, assumed
the perfect man, and refuses to acknowledge that, being begotten in the
flesh of the Virgin,<sup>[4](footnote/fn9.htm#P929_250818.md)</sup> He
became man and was born in Bethlehem, and was brought up in Nazareth,
and advanced in age, and on completing the set number of years (appeared
in public and) was baptized in the Jordan, and received this testimony
from the Father, "This is my beloved
Son,"<sup>[5](footnote/fn9.htm#P930_251122.md)</sup> even as it is written,
let him be anathema.

How could it be said that Christ (the Lord) assumed the perfect man just
like one of the prophets, when He, being the Lord Himself, became man by
the incarnation effected through the Virgin? Wherefore it is written,
that "the first man was of the earth,
earthy."<sup>[6](footnote/fn9.htm#P934_251458.md)</sup> But whereas he that
was formed of the earth returned to the earth, He that became the second
man returned to heaven. And so we read of the "first Adam and the last
Adam."<sup>[7](footnote/fn9.htm#P935_251647.md)</sup> And as it is admitted
that the second came by the first according to the flesh, for which
reason also Christ is called man and the Son of man; so is the witness
given that the second is the Savior of the first, for whose sake He came
down from heaven. And as the Word came down from heaven, and was made
man, and ascended again to heaven, He is on that account said to be the
second Adam from heaven.

If any one affirms that Christ was born of the seed of man by the
Virgin, in the same manner as all men are born, and refuses to
acknowledge that He was made flesh by the Holy Spirit and the holy
Virgin Mary, mad became man of the seed of David, even as it is written,
let him be anathema.

How could one say that Christ was born of the seed of man by the Virgin,
when the holy Gospel and the angel, in proclaiming the good tidings,
testify of Mary the Virgin that she said, "How shall this be, seeing I
know not a man? "<sup>[8](footnote/fn9.htm#P942_252607.md)</sup> Wherefore
he says, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which
shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of the
Highest."<sup>[9](footnote/fn9.htm#P943_252831.md)</sup> And to Joseph he
says, "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is
conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a soil,
and they shall call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from
their sins."<sup>[10](footnote/fn9.htm#P944_253087.md)</sup>

If any one affirms that the Son of God who is before the ages is one,
and He who has appeared in these last times is another, and refuses to
acknowledge that He who is before the ages is the same with Him who
appeared in these last times, even as it is written, let him be
anathema.

How could it be said that the Son of God who is before the ages, and He
who has appeared in these last times, are different, when the Lord
Himself says, "Before Abraham was, I am;
"<sup>[11](footnote/fn9.htm#P951_253593.md)</sup> and, "I came forth from
God, and I come, and again I go to my Father?
"<sup>[12](footnote/fn9.htm#P952_253685.md)</sup>

If any one affirms that He who suffered is one, and that He who suffered
not is another, and refuses to acknowledge that the Word, who is Himself
the impassibie and unchangeable God, suffered in the flesh which He had
assumed really, yet without mutation, even as it is written,

How could it be said that He who suffered is one, and He who suffered
not another, when the Lord Himself says, "The Son of man must suffer
many things, and be killed, and be raised again the third day from the
dead; "<sup>[13](footnote/fn9.htm#P959_254227.md)</sup> and again, "When ye
see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the Father;
"<sup>[14](footnote/fn9.htm#P960_254329.md)</sup> and again, "When the Son
of man cometh in the glory of His Father?
"<sup>[15](footnote/fn9.htm#P961_254432.md)</sup>

If any one affirms that Christ is saved, and refuses to acknowledge that
He is the Saviour of the world, and the Light of the world, even as it
is written,<sup>[16](footnote/fn9.htm#P965_254618.md)</sup> let him be
anathema.

How could one say that Christ is saved, when the Lord Himself says, "I
am the life; "<sup>[17](footnote/fn9.htm#P969_254794.md)</sup> and, "I am
come that they might have life;
"<sup>[18](footnote/fn9.htm#P970_254865.md)</sup> and, "He that believeth
on me shall not see death, but he shall behold the life eternal?
"<sup>[19](footnote/fn9.htm#P971_254973.md)</sup>

If any one affirms that Christ is perfect man and also God the Word in
the way of separation,<sup>[20](footnote/fn9.htm#P975_255098.md)</sup> and
refuses to acknowledge the one Lord Jesus Christ, even as it is written,
let him be anathema.

How could one say that Christ is perfect man and also God the Word in
the way of separation, when the Lord Himself says, "Why seek ye to kill
me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God?
"<sup>[21](footnote/fn9.htm#P979_255435.md)</sup> For God the Word did not
give a man for us, but He gave Himself for us, having been made man for
our sake. Wherefore He says: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I
will raise it up. But He spake of the temple of His
body."<sup>[22](footnote/fn9.htm#P980_255682.md)</sup>

If any one says that Christ suffers change or alteration, and refuses to
acknowledge that He is unchangeable in the Spirit, though
corruptible<sup>[23](footnote/fn9.htm#P984_255862.md)</sup> in the
flesh,<sup>[24](footnote/fn9.htm#P985_255898.md)</sup> let him be anathema.

How could one say that Christ suffers change or alteration, when the
Lord Himself says, "I am and change
not;<sup>[25](footnote/fn9.htm#P989_256166.md)</sup> again, His soul shall
not be left in Hades, neither shall His flesh see corruption?
"<sup>[26](footnote/fn9.htm#P990_256270.md)</sup>

If any one affirms that Christ assumed the man only in part, and refuses
to acknowledge that He was made in all things like us, apart from sin,
let him be anathema.

How could one say that Christ assumed the man only in part, when the
Lord Himself says, "I lay down my life, that I might take it again, for
the sheep; "<sup>[27](footnote/fn9.htm#P997_256641.md)</sup> and, "My flesh
is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed;
"<sup>[28](footnote/fn9.htm#P998_256721.md)</sup> and, "He that eateth my
flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life?
"<sup>[29](footnote/fn9.htm#P999_256814.md)</sup>

If any one affirms that the body of Christ is void of soul and
understanding,<sup>[30](footnote/fn10.htm#P1003_256919.md)</sup> and
refuses to acknowledge that He is perfect man, one and the same in all
things (with us), let him be anathema.

How could one say that the body of the Lord (Christ) is void of soul and
understanding? For perturbation, and grief, and distress, are not the
properties either of a flesh void of soul, or of a soul void of
understanding; nor are they the sign of the immutable Divinity, nor the
index of a mere phantasm, nor do they mark the defect of human weakness;
but the Word exhibited in Himself the exercise of the affections and
susceptibilities proper to us, having endued Himself with our
passibility, even as it is written, that "He hath borne our griefs, and
carried our sorrows."<sup>[31](footnote/fn10.htm#P1007_257649.md)</sup> For
perturbation, and grief, and distress, are disorders of soul; and toil,
and sleep, and the body's liability to wounding, are infirmities of the
flesh.

If any one says that Christ was manifested in the world only in
semblance, and refuses to acknowledge that He came actually in the
flesh, let him be anathema.

How could one say that Christ was manifested only in semblance in the
world, born as He was in Bethlehem, and made to submit to the
circumcising of the flesh, and lifted up by Simeon, and brought up on to
His twelfth year (at home), and made subject to His parents, and
baptized in Jordan, and nailed to the cross, and raised again from the
dead?

Wherefore, when it is said that He was "troubled in
spirit,"<sup>[32](footnote/fn10.htm#P1015_258409.md)</sup> that "He was
sorrowful in soul,"<sup>[33](footnote/fn10.htm#P1016_258479.md)</sup> that
"He was wounded in body,"<sup>[34](footnote/fn10.htm#P1017_258531.md)</sup>
He places before us designations of susceptibilities proper to our
constitution, in order to show that He was made man in the world, and
had His conversation with
men,<sup>[35](footnote/fn10.htm#P1018_258718.md)</sup> yet without sin. For
He was born in Bethlehem according to the flesh, in a manner meet for
Deity, the angels of heaven recognising Him as their Lord, and hymning
as their God Him who was then wrapped in swaddling-clothes in a manger,
and exclaiming, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good-will among men."<sup>[36](footnote/fn10.htm#P1019_259061.md)</sup> He
was brought tip in Nazareth; but in divine fashion He sat among the
doctors, and astonished them by a wisdom beyond His years, in respect of
the capacities of His bodily life, as is recorded in the Gospel
narrative. He was baptized in Jordan, not as receiving any
sanctification for Himself, but as gifting a participation in
sanctification to others. He was tempted in the wilderness, not as
giving way, however, to temptation, but as putting our temptations
before Himself on the challenge of the tempter, in order to show the
powerlessness of the tempter.

Wherefore He says, "Be of good cheer, I have overcome the
world."<sup>[37](footnote/fn10.htm#P1021_259706.md)</sup> And this He said,
not as holding before us any contest proper only to a God, but as
showing our own flesh in its capacity to overcome suffering, and death,
and corruption, in order that, as sin entered into the world by flesh,
and death came to reign by sin over all men, the sin in the flesh might
also be condemned through the selfsame flesh in the likeness
thereof;<sup>[38](footnote/fn10.htm#P1022_260094.md)</sup> and that that
overseer of sin, the tempter, might be overcome, and death be cast down
from its sovereignty, and the corruption in the burying of the body be
done away, and the first-fruits of the resurrection be shown, and the
principle of righteousness begin its course in the world through faith,
and the kingdom of heaven be preached to men, and fellowship be
established between God and men.

In behalf of this grace let us glorify the Father, who has given His
only begotten Son for the life of the world. Let us glorify the Holy
Spirit that worketh in us, and quickeneth us, and furnisheth the gifts
meet for the fellowship of God; and let us not intermeddle with the word
of the Gospel by lifeless disputations, scattering about endless
questionings and logomachies, and making a hard thing of the gentle and
simple word of faith; but rather let us work the work of faith, let us
love peace, let us exhibit concord, let us preserve unity, let us
cultivate love, with which God is well pleased.

As it is not for us to know the times or the seasons which the Father
hath put in His own
power,<sup>[39](footnote/fn10.htm#P1025_261215.md)</sup> but only to
believe that there will come an end to time, and that there will be a
manifestation of a future world, and a revelation of judgment, and an
advent of the Son of God, and a recompense of works, and an inheritance
in the kingdom of heaven, so it is not for us to know how the Son of God
became man; for this is a great mystery, as it is written, "Who shall
declare His generation? for His life is taken from the
earth."<sup>[40](footnote/fn10.htm#P1026_261662.md)</sup> But it is for us
to believe that the Son of God became man, according to the Scriptures;
and that He was seen on the earth, and had His conversation with men,
according to the Scriptures, in their likeness, yet without sin; and
that He died for us, and rose again from the dead, as it is written; and
that He was taken up to heaven, and sat down at the right hand of the
Father, whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead, as it is
written; lest, while we war against each other with words, any should be
led to blaspheme the word of faith, and that should come to pass which
is written, "By reason of you is my
name<sup>[41](footnote/fn10.htm#P1027_262308.md)</sup> continually
blasphemed among the
nations."<sup>[42](footnote/fn10.htm#P1028_262377.md)</sup>
