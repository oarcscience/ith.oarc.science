##  Elucidations.

Neale, in his valuable
work,<sup>[118](footnote/fn6.htm#P676_200241.md)</sup> does full justice to
Dionysius, whose life is *twinned* with Gregory's; but he seems to me
most unaccountably to slight the truly great and commanding genius of
Gregory. I take opportunity, then, to direct attention to Neale's
candid, and, on the whole, favourable view of Origen; but it grieves me
whenever I see in critics a manifest inability to *put themselves back
into the times* of which they write, as I think is the case, not
infrequently, even with Dr. Neale. The figure of this grand ornament of
the mighty patriarchate and school of Alexandria is
colossal.<sup>[119](footnote/fn6.htm#P677_200859.md)</sup> His genius is
Titanic, and has left all Christendom profoundly his debtor to this day,
by the variety of his work and the versatility of his speech and pen.
Doubtless the youthful Gregory's panegyric does contain, as he himself
suggests, much that is "puerile or bordering on flattery; "but, as he
protests with transparent truthfulness, "there is nothing in it unreal."
It shines with "sincerity of thought and integrity of judgment." And as
such, what a portrait it presents us of the love and patient effort of
this lifelong confessor! Let me commend this example to professors of
theology generally. All can learn from it the power of sweetness and
love, united with holiness of purpose, to stamp the minds and the
characters of youth with the divine "image and superscription."

But, as to the sharpness of modern censures upon Origen's conspicuous
faults, I must suggest three important considerations, which should be
applied to all the Ante-Nicene doctors: (1) How could they who were
working out the formulas of orthodoxy, be expected to use phrases with
the skill and precision which became necessary only after the great
Synodical period had embodied them in clear, dogmatic statements? (2)
How could the active intellect of an Origen have failed to make great
mistakes in such an immensity of labours and such a variety of works?
(3) If, in our own day, we indulge speculative minds in large liberties
so long as they never make shipwreck of the faith, how much more should
we deem them excusable who were unable to consult libraries of
well-digested thought, and to employ, as we do, the accumulated wealth
of fifty generations of believers, whenever we are called to the solemn
responsibility of impressing our convictions upon others? The conclusion
of Dr. Neale's review of Origen balances the praise and blame accorded
to him by those nearest to his
times;<sup>[120](footnote/fn6.htm#P679_202829.md)</sup> but let us reflect
upon the painful conflicts of those times, and upon the pressure under
which, to justify their own positions, they were often forced to object
to any error glorified by even the apparent patronage of Origen.
