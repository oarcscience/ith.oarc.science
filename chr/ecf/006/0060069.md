##  II.-A Section on the Writings of Pierius.<sup>[1](footnote/fn28.htm#P2826_743721.md)</sup>

--------

There was read a book by Pierius the presbyter, who, they say, endured
the conflict<sup>[2](footnote/fn28.htm#P2831_743931.md)</sup> for Christ,
along with his brother Isidorus. And he is reputed to have been the
teacher of the martyr Pamphilus in ecclesiastical studies, and to have
been president of the school at Alexandria.The work contained twelve
books.<sup>[3](footnote/fn28.htm#P2832_744175.md)</sup> And in style he is
perspicuous and clear, with the easy flow, as it were, of a spoken
address, displaying no signs of laboured
art,<sup>[4](footnote/fn28.htm#P2833_744319.md)</sup> but bearing us
quietly along, smoothly and gently, like off-hand speaking. And in
argument he is most fertile, if any one is so. And he expresses his
opinion on many things outside what is now established in the Church,
perhaps in an antique
manner;&lt;dawn&gt;<sup>[5](footnote/fn28.htm#P2834_744606.md)</sup> but
with respect to the Father and the Son, he sets forth his sentiments
piously, except that he speaks of two substances and two natures; using,
however, the terms substance and nature, as is apparent from what
follows, and from what precedes this passage, in the sense of
person<sup>[6](footnote/fn28.htm#P2835_744956.md)</sup> and not in the
sense put on it by the adherents of Arius. With respect to the Spirit,
however, he lays down his opinion in a very dangerous and far from pious
manner. For he affirms that He is inferior to the Father and the Son in
glory.<sup>[7](footnote/fn28.htm#P2836_745257.md)</sup> He has a passage
also in the book<sup>[8](footnote/fn28.htm#P2837_745348.md)</sup> entitled,
*On the Gospel according to Luke*, from which it is possible to show
that the honour or dishonour of the image is also the honour or
dishonour of the original. And, again, he indulges in some obscure
speculations, after the manner of the nonsense of Origen, on the subject
of the "pre-existence of souls." And also in the book on the Passover
(Easter) and on Hosea, he treats both of the cherubim made by Moses, and
of the pillar of Jacob, in which passages he admits the actual
construction of those things, but propounds the foolish theory that they
were given economically, and that they were in no respect like other
things which are made; inasmuch as they bore the likeness of no other
form, but had only, as he foolishly says, the appearance of
wings.<sup>[9](footnote/fn28.htm#P2838_746178.md)</sup>
