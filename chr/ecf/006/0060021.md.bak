##  Elucidations.

I.

(Substance or accident, p. 54.)

This essay is "rather the work of a philosopher than a bishop," says
Dupin. He assigns it to an age when "Aristotle *began to be in some
reputation*,"-a most important concession as to the estimate of this
philosopher among the early faithful. We need not wonder that such
admissions, honourable to his candour and to his orthodoxy, brought on
him the hatred and persecutions of the Jesuits. Even Bossuet thought he
went too far, and wrote against him. But, the whole system of Roman
dogma being grounded in Aristotle's *physics* as well as in his
*metaphysics*, Dupin was not orthodox in the eyes of the society that
framed Aristotle into a creed, and made it the creed of the
"Roman-Catholic Church." Note, e.g., "transubstantiation," which is not
true if Aristotle's theory of *accidents*, etc., is
false.<sup>[25](footnote/fn11.htm#P1119_279418.md)</sup> It assumes an
exploded science.

II.

(Prerogative of the soul, p. 56.)

If this Discourse be worthy of study, it may be profitably contrasted,
step by step, with Tertullian's treatises on kindred
subjects.<sup>[26](footnote/fn11.htm#P1126_279686.md)</sup> That the early
Christians should reason concerning the Soul, the Mind, the immortal
Spirit, was natural in itself. But it was also forced upon them by the
"philosophers" and the heretics, with whom they daily came into
conflict. This is apparent from the
*Anti-Marcion*<sup>[27](footnote/fn11.htm#P1127_279995.md)</sup> of the
great Carthaginian. The annotations upon that treatise, and those On the
Soul's Testimony and On the Soul, may suffice as pointing out the best
sources<sup>[28](footnote/fn11.htm#P1128_280222.md)</sup> of information on
speculative points and their bearings on theology. Compare, however,
Athenagoras<sup>[29](footnote/fn11.htm#P1129_280380.md)</sup> and the great
Clement of Alexandria.<sup>[30](footnote/fn11.htm#P1130_280450.md)</sup>
