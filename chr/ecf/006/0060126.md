##  Oration on the Psalms.<sup>[1](footnote/fn61.md)</sup>

I. Blessed be God; let us proceed, brethren, from wonders to the
miracles of the Lord, and as it were, from strength to
strength.<sup>[2](footnote/fn61.htm#P6151_1890296.md)</sup> For just as in
a golden chain the links are so intimately joined and connected
together, as that the one holds the other, and is fitted on to it, and
so carries on the chain-even so the miracles that have been handed down
by the holy Gospels, one after the other, lead on the Church of God,
which delights in festivity, and refresh it, not with the meat that
perisheth, but with that which endureth unto everlasting
life.<sup>[3](footnote/fn61.htm#P6152_1890736.md)</sup> Come then, beloved,
and let us, too, with prepared hearts, and with ears intent, listen to
what the Lord our God shall say unto us out of the prophets and Gospels
concerning this most sacred feast. Verily, He will speak peace unto His
people, and to His saints, and to those which turn their hearts unto
Him. To-day,<sup>[4](footnote/fn61.htm#P6153_1891069.md)</sup> the
trumpet-blast of the prophets have roused the world, and have made glad
and filled with joyfulness the churches of God that are everywhere
amongst the nations. And, summoning the faithful from the exercise of
holy fasting, and from the palaestra, wherein they struggle against the
lusts of the flesh, they have taught them to sing a new hymn of conquest
and a new song of peace to Christ who giveth the victory. Come then,
every one, and let us rejoice in the Lord; O come, all ye people, and
let us clap our hands, and make a joyful noise to God our Saviour, with
the voice of melody.<sup>[5](footnote/fn61.htm#P6154_1891735.md)</sup> Let
no one be without portion in this grace; let no one come short of this
calling; for the seed of the disobedient is appointed to
destruction.-Let no one neglect to meet the King, lest he be shut out
from the Bridegroom's chamber.-Let no one amongst us be found to receive
Him with a sad countenance, lest he be condemned with those wicked
citizens-the citizens, I mean, who refused to receive the Lord as King
over them.<sup>[6](footnote/fn61.htm#P6155_1892194.md)</sup> Let us all
come together cheerfully; let us all receive Him gladly, and hold our
feast with all honesty. Instead of our garments, let us strew our hearts
before Him,<sup>[7](footnote/fn61.htm#P6156_1892377.md)</sup> In psalms and
hymns, let us raise to Him our shouts of thanksgiving; and, without
ceasing, let us exclaim, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord; "<sup>[8](footnote/fn61.htm#P6157_1892554.md)</sup> for blessed are
they that bless Him, and cursed are they that curse
Him.<sup>[9](footnote/fn61.htm#P6158_1892700.md)</sup> Again I will say it,
nor will I cease exhorting you to good, Come, beloved, let us bless Him
who is blessed, that we may be ourselves blessed of Him. Every age and
condition does this discourse summon to praise the Lord; kings of the
earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth; both young
men and maidens<sup>[10](footnote/fn61.htm#P6159_1893042.md)</sup> -and
what is new in this miracle, the tender and innocent age of babes and
sucklings hath obtained the first place in raising to God with thankful
confession the hymn which was of God taught them in the strains in which
Moses sang before to the people when they came forth out of
Egypt-namely, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord."

II\. To-day, holy David rejoices with great joy, being by babes
despoiled of his lyre, with whom also, in spirit, leading the dance, and
rejoicing together, as of old, before the ark of
God,<sup>[11](footnote/fn61.htm#P6161_1893604.md)</sup> he mingles musical
harmony, and sweetly lisps out in stammering voice, Blessed is He that
cometh in the name of the Lord. Of whom shall we inquire? Tell us, O
prophet, who is this that cometh in the name of the Lord? He will say it
is not my part to-day to teach you, for He hath consecrated the school
to infants, who hath out of the mouth of babes and sucklings perfected
praise to destroy the enemy and the
avenger,<sup>[12](footnote/fn61.htm#P6162_1894043.md)</sup> in order that
by the miracle of these the hearts of the fathers might be turned to the
children, and the disobedient unto the wisdom of the
just.<sup>[13](footnote/fn61.htm#P6163_1894207.md)</sup> Tell us, then, O
children, whence is this, your beautiful and graceful contest of song?
Who taught it you? Who instructed you? Who brought you together? What
were your tablets? Who were your teachers? Do but you, they say, join us
as our companions in this song and festivity, and you will learn the
things which were by Moses and the prophet earnestly longed
for.<sup>[14](footnote/fn61.htm#P6164_1894602.md)</sup> Since then the
children have invited us, and have given unto us the right hand of
fellowship,<sup>[15](footnote/fn61.htm#P6165_1894713.md)</sup> let us come,
beloved, and ourselves emulate that holy chorus, and with the apostles,
let us make way for Him who ascends over the heaven of heavens towards
the East,<sup>[16](footnote/fn61.htm#P6166_1894896.md)</sup> and who, of
His good pleasure, is upon the earth mounted upon an ass's colt. Let us,
with the children, raise the branches aloft, and with the olive branches
make glad applaud, that upon us also the Holy Spirit may breathe, and
that in due order we may raise the God-taught strain: "Blessed is He
that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the
highest."<sup>[17](footnote/fn61.htm#P6167_1895279.md)</sup> To-day, also,
the patriarch Jacob keeps feast in spirit, seeing his prophecy brought
to a fulfilment, and with the faithful adores the Father, seeing Him who
bound his foal to the
vine<sup>[18](footnote/fn61.htm#P6168_1895483.md)</sup> mounted upon an
ass's colt. To-day the foal is made ready, the irrational exemplar of
the Gentiles, who before were irrational, to signify the subjection of
the people of the Gentiles; and the babes declare their former state of
childhood, in respect of the knowledge of God, and their after
perfecting, by the worship of God and the exercise of the true religion.
To-day, according to the
prophet,<sup>[19](footnote/fn61.htm#P6169_1895902.md)</sup> is the King of
Glory glorified upon earth, and makes us, the inhabitants of earth,
partakers of the heavenly feast, that He may show himself to be the Lord
of both, even as He is hymned with the common praises of both. Therefore
it was that the heavenly hosts sang, announcing salvation upon earth,
"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of hosts; the whole earth is full of
His glory."<sup>[20](footnote/fn61.htm#P6170_1896306.md)</sup> And those
below, joining in harmony with the joyous hymns of heaven, cried:
"Hosanna in the highest; Hosanna to the Son of David." In heaven the
doxology was raised, "Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place;
"<sup>[21](footnote/fn61.htm#P6171_1896541.md)</sup> and on earth was this
caught tip in the words, "Blessed is he. that cometh in the name of the
Lord."

III\. But while these things were doing, and the disciples were
rejoicing and praising God with a loud voice for all the mighty works
that they had seen, saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name
of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the
highest;<sup>[22](footnote/fn61.htm#P6173_1896922.md)</sup> the city began
to inquire, saying, Who is
this?<sup>[23](footnote/fn61.htm#P6174_1896993.md)</sup> stirring up its
hardened and inveterate envy against the glory of the Lord. But when
thou hearest me say the city, understand the ancient and disorderly
multitude of the synagogue. They ungratefully and malignantly ask, Who
is this? as if they had never yet seen their Benefactor, and Him whom
divine miracles, beyond the power of man, had made famous and renowned;
for the darkness comprehended
not<sup>[24](footnote/fn61.htm#P6175_1897413.md)</sup> that unsetting light
which shone in upon it. Hence quite appositely with respect to them hath
the prophet Isaiah exclaimed, saying, Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind,
that ye may see. And who is blind, but my children? and deaf, but they
that have the dominion over
them?<sup>[25](footnote/fn61.htm#P6176_1897701.md)</sup> And the servants
of the Lord have become blind; ye have often seen, but ye observed not;
your ears are opened, yet ye hear not. See, beloved, how accurate are
these words; how the Divine Spirit, who Himself sees beforehand into the
future, has by His saints foretold of things future as if they were
present. For these thankless men saw, and by means of His miracles
handled the wonder-working God, and yet remained in
unbelief.<sup>[26](footnote/fn61.htm#P6177_1898153.md)</sup> They saw a
man, blind from his birth, proclaiming to them the God who had restored
his sight. They saw a paralytic, who had grown up, as it were, and
become one with his infirmity, at His bidding loosed from his
disease.<sup>[27](footnote/fn61.htm#P6178_1898388.md)</sup> They saw
Lazarus, who was made an exile from the region of
death.<sup>[28](footnote/fn61.htm#P6179_1898470.md)</sup> They heard that
He had walked on the
sea.<sup>[29](footnote/fn61.htm#P6180_1898530.md)</sup> They heard of the
wine that, without previous culture, was
ministered;<sup>[30](footnote/fn61.htm#P6181_1898621.md)</sup> of the bread
that was eaten at that spontaneous
banquet;<sup>[31](footnote/fn61.htm#P6182_1898695.md)</sup> they heard that
the demons had been put to flight; the sick restored to
health<sup>[32](footnote/fn61.htm#P6183_1898792.md)</sup> Their very
streets proclaimed His deeds of wonder; their roads declared His healing
power to those who journeyed on them. All Judea was filled with His
benefit; yet now, when they hear the divine praises, they inquire, Who
is this? O the madness of these falsely-named teachers! O incredulous
fathers! O foolish seniors! O seed of the shameless Canaan, and not of
Judah the devout!<sup>[33](footnote/fn61.htm#P6184_1899199.md)</sup> The
children acknowledge their Creator, but their unbelieving parents said,
Who is this? The age that was young and inexperienced sang praises to
God, while they that had waxen old in wickedness inquired, Who is this?
Sucklings praise His Divinity, while seniors utter blasphemies; children
piously offer the sacrifice of praise, whilst profane priests are
impiously indignant.<sup>[34](footnote/fn61.htm#P6185_1899603.md)</sup>

IV\. O ye disobedient as regards the wisdom of the
just,<sup>[35](footnote/fn61.htm#P6187_1899680.md)</sup> turn your hearts
to your children. Learn the mysteries of God; the very thing itself
which is being done bears witness that it is God that is thus hymned by
uninstructed tongues. Search the Scriptures, as ye have
heard<sup>[36](footnote/fn61.htm#P6188_1899916.md)</sup> from the Lord; for
they are they which testify of Him, and be not ignorant of this miracle.
Hear ye men without grace, and thankless, what good tidings the prophet
Zechariah brings to you. He says, Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion;
behold thy King cometh unto thee: just and having salvation; lowly, and
riding upon the foal of an
ass.<sup>[37](footnote/fn61.htm#P6189_1900272.md)</sup> Why do ye repel the
joy? Why, when the sun shineth, do ye love darkness? Why do ye against
unconquerable peace meditate war? If, therefore, ye be the sons of Zion,
join in the dance together with your children. Let the religious service
of your children be to you a pretext for joy. Learn from them who was
their Teacher; who called them together; whence was the doctrine; what
means this new theology and old prophecy. And if no man hath taught them
this, but of their own accord they raise the hymn of praise, then
recognise the work of God, even as it is written in the law: "Out of the
mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected
praise."<sup>[38](footnote/fn61.htm#P6190_1900938.md)</sup> Redouble,
therefore, your joy, that you have been made the fathers of such
children who, under the teaching of God, have celebrated with their
praises things unknown to their seniors. Turn your hearts to your
children,<sup>[39](footnote/fn61.htm#P6191_1901175.md)</sup> and close not
your eyes against the truth. But if you remain the same, and hearing,
hear not, and seeing, perceive
not,<sup>[40](footnote/fn61.htm#P6192_1901312.md)</sup> and to no purpose
dissent from your children, then shall they be your
judges<sup>[41](footnote/fn61.htm#P6193_1901407.md)</sup> according to the
Saviour's word. Well, therefore, even this thing also, together with
others, has the prophet Isaiah spoken before of you, saying, Jacob shall
not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. But when they
see their children doing my works, they shall for me sanctify My name,
and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that
murmured shall learn obedience, and the stammering tongues shall learn
to speak peace.<sup>[42](footnote/fn61.htm#P6194_1901957.md)</sup> Seest
thou, O foolish Jew, how from the beginning of his discourse, the
prophet declares confusion to you because of your unbelief. Learn even
from him how he proclaims the God-inspired hymn of praise that is raised
by your children, even as the blessed David hath declared beforehand;
saying, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected
praise. Either then,-as is right,-claim the piety of your children for
your own, or devoutly give your children unto us. We with them will lead
the dance, and to the new glory will sing in concert the
divinely-inspired hymn.

V. Once, indeed, the aged Simeon met the
Saviour<sup>[43](footnote/fn61.htm#P6196_1902608.md)</sup> and received in
his arms, as an infant, the Creator of the world, and proclaimed Him to
be Lord and God; but now, in the place of foolish elders, children meet
the Saviour, even as Simeon did, and instead of their arms, strew under
Him the branches of trees, and bless the Lord God seated upon a colt, as
upon the cherubim, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is He that
cometh in the name of the Lord; and together with these let us also
exclaim, Blessed is He that cometh, God the King of Glory, who, for our
sakes, became poor, yet, in His own proper estate, being ignorant of
poverty, that with His bounty He might make us rich. Blessed is He who
once came in humility, and who will hereafter come again in glory: at
the first, lowly, and seated upon an ass's colt, and by infants extolled
in order that it might be fulfilled which was written: Thy goings have
been seen, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary;
but at the second time seated on the clouds, in terrible majesty, by
angels and powers attended. O the mellifluous tongue of the children! O
the sincere doctrine of those who are well pleasing to God! David in
prophecy hid the spirit under the letter; children, opening their
treasures, brought forth riches upon their tongues, and, in language
full of grace, invited clearly all men to enjoy them. Therefore let us
with them draw forth the unfading riches. In our bosoms insatiate, and
in treasure-houses which cannot be filled, let us lay up the divine
gifts. Let us exclaim without ceasing, Blessed is He that cometh in the
name of the Lord! Very God, in the name of the Very God, the Omnipotent
from the Omnipotent, the Son in the name of the Father. The true King
from the true King, whose kingdom, even as His who begat Him, is with
eternity, coeval and pre-existent to it. For this is common to both; nor
does the Scripture attribute this honour to the Son, as if it came from
another source, nor as if it had a beginning, or could be added to or
diminished-away with the thought!-but as that which is His of right by
nature, and by a true and proper possession. For the kingdom of the
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is one, even as their
substance is one and their dominion one. Whence also, with one and the
same adoration, we worship the one Deity in three Persons, subsisting
without beginning, uncreate, without end, and to which there is no
successor. For neither will the Father ever cease to be the Father, nor
again the Son to be the Son and King, nor the Holy Ghost to be what in
substance and personality He is. For nothing of the Trinity will suffer
diminution, either in respect of eternity, or of communion, or of
sovereignty. For not on that account is the Son of God called king,
because for our sakes He was made man, and in the flesh cast down the
tyrant that was against us, having, by taking this upon Him, obtained
the victory over its cruel enemy, but because He is always Lord and God;
therefore it is that now, both after His assumption of the flesh and for
ever, He remains a king, even as He who begat Him. Speak not, O heretic,
against the kingdom of Christ, lest thou dishonour Him who begat Him. If
thou art faithful, in faith approach Christ, our very Cod, and not as
using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness. If thou art a servant,
with trembling be subject unto thy Master; for he who fights against the
Word is not a well-disposed servant, but a manifest enemy, as it is
written: He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which
hath sent Him.

VI\. But let us, beloved, return in our discourse to that point whence
we digressed, exclaiming, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord: that good and kind Shepherd, voluntarily to lay down His life for
His sheep. That just as hunters take by a sheep the wolves that devour
sheep, even so the Chief
Shepherd,<sup>[44](footnote/fn61.htm#P6198_1906499.md)</sup> offering
Himself as man to the spiritual wolves and those who destroy the soul,
may make His prey of the destroyers by means of that Adam who was once
preyed on by them. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord:
God against the devil; not manifestly in His might, which cannot be
looked on, but in the weakness of the flesh, to bind the strong
man<sup>[45](footnote/fn61.htm#P6199_1906874.md)</sup> that is against us.
Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: the King against the
tyrant; not with omnipotent power and wisdom, but with that which is
accounted the
foolishness<sup>[46](footnote/fn62.htm#P6200_1907081.md)</sup> of the
cross, which hath reft his spoils from the serpent who is wise in
wickedness. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: the True
One against the liar; the Saviour against the destroyer; the Prince of
Peace<sup>[47](footnote/fn62.htm#P6201_1907322.md)</sup> against him who
stirs up wars; the Lover of mankind against the hater of mankind.
Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: the Lord to have
mercy upon the creature of His hands. Blessed is He that cometh in the
name of the Lord: the Lord to save man who had wandered in error; to put
away error; to give light to those who are in darkness; to abolish the
imposture of idols; in its place to bring in the saving knowledge of
God; to sanctify the world; to drive away the abomination and misery of
the worship of false gods. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord: the one for the many; to deliver the
poor<sup>[48](footnote/fn62.htm#P6202_1907965.md)</sup> out of the hands of
them that are too strong for him, yea, the poor and needy from him that
spoileth him. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, to pour
wine and oil upon him who had fallen amongst
thieves,<sup>[49](footnote/fn62.htm#P6203_1908203.md)</sup> and had been
passed by. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: to save us
by Himself, as says the prophet; no ambassador, nor angel, but the Lord
Himself saved us.<sup>[50](footnote/fn62.htm#P6204_1908396.md)</sup>
Therefore we also bless Thee, O Lord; Thou with the Father and the Holy
Spirit art blessed before the worlds and for ever. Before the world,
indeed, and until now being devoid of body, but now and for ever
henceforth possessed of that divine humanity which cannot be changed,
and from which Thou art never divided.

VII\. Let us look also at what follows. What says the most divine
evangelist? When the Lord had entered into the temple, the blind and the
lame came to Him; and He healed them. And when the chief priests and
Pharisees saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying,
and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in
the name of the Lord,<sup>[51](footnote/fn62.htm#P6206_1909102.md)</sup>
they brooked not this honour that was paid Him, and therefore they came
to Him, and thus spake, Hearest Thou not what these say? As if they
said, Art Thou not grieved at hearing from these innocents things which
befit God, and God alone? Has not God of old made it manifest by the
prophet, "My glory will I not give unto another;
"<sup>[52](footnote/fn62.htm#P6207_1909457.md)</sup> and how dost Thou,
being a man, make Thyself
God?<sup>[53](footnote/fn62.htm#P6208_1909526.md)</sup> But what to this
answers the long-suffering One, He who is abundant in
mercy,<sup>[54](footnote/fn62.htm#P6209_1909621.md)</sup> and slow to
wrath?<sup>[55](footnote/fn62.htm#P6210_1909658.md)</sup> He bears with
these frenzied ones; with an apology He keeps their wrath in check; in
His turn He calls the Scriptures to their remembrance; He brings forward
testimony to what is done, and shrinks not from inquiry. Wherefore He
says, Have ye never heard Me saying by the prophet, Then shall ye know
that I am He that doth
speak?<sup>[56](footnote/fn62.htm#P6211_1910004.md)</sup> nor again, Out of
the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise because of
Thine enemies, that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger? Which
without doubt are ye, who give heed unto the law, and read the prophets,
while yet ye despise Me who, both by the law and the prophets, have been
beforehand proclaimed. Ye think, indeed, under a pretence of piety, to
avenge the glory of God, not understanding that he that despiseth Me
despiseth My Father
also.<sup>[57](footnote/fn62.htm#P6212_1910497.md)</sup> I came forth from
God, and am come into the
world,<sup>[58](footnote/fn62.htm#P6213_1910566.md)</sup> and My glory is
the glory of My Father also. Even thus these foolish ones, being
convinced by our Saviour-God, ceased to answer Him again, the truth
stopping their mouths; but adopting a new and foolish device, they took
counsel against Him. But let us sing, Great is our Lord, and great is
His power;<sup>[59](footnote/fn62.htm#P6214_1910887.md)</sup> and of His
understanding there is no number. For all this was done that the Lamb
and Son of God, that taketh away the sins of the world, might, of His
own will, and for us, come to His saving Passion, and might be
recognised, as it were, in the market and place of selling; and that
those who bought Him might for thirty pieces of silver covenant for Him
who, with His life-giving blood, was to redeem the world; and that
Christ, our passover, might be sacrificed for us, in order that those
who were sprinkled with His precious blood, and sealed on their lips, as
the posts of the door,<sup>[60](footnote/fn62.htm#P6215_1911495.md)</sup>
might escape from the darts of the destroyer; and that Christ having
thus suffered in the flesh, and having risen again the third day, might,
with equal honour and glory with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be by
all created things equally adored; for to Him every knee shall bow, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the
earth,<sup>[61](footnote/fn62.htm#P6216_1911863.md)</sup> sending up glory
to Him, for ever and ever. Amen.
