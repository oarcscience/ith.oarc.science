##  II.-Narrative of Events Happening in Persia on the Birth of Christ<sup>[1](footnote/fn21.md)</sup>

The best introduction to this production will be the following preface,
as given in Migne:-Many men of learning thus far have been of opinion
that the narrative by Africanus of events happening in Persia on
Christ's birth,<sup>[2](footnote/fn21.htm#P2179_620777.md)</sup> is a
fragment of that famous work which Sextus Julius Africanus, a Christian
author of the third century after Christ, composed on the history of the
world in the chronological order of events up to the reign of Macrinus,
and presented in five books to Alexander, son of Mammaea, with the view
of obtaining the restoration of his native town Emmaus. With the same
expectation which I see incited Lambecius and his compendiator
Nesselius, I, too, set myself with the greatest eagerness to go over the
codices of our Electoral Library.... But, as the common proverb goes, I
found coals instead of treasure. This narrative, so far from its being
to be ascribed to a writer well reputed by the common voice of
antiquity, does not contain anything worthy of the genius of the
chronographer Africanus. Wherefore, since by the unanimous testimony of
the ancients he was a man of consummate learning and sharpest judgment,
while the author of the *Cesti*, which also puts forward the name of
Africanus, has been long marked by critics with the character either of
anile credulity, or of a marvellous propensity to superstitious fancies,
I can readily fall in with the opinion of those who think that he is a
different person from the chronographer, and would ascribe this wretched
production also to him. But, dear reader, on perusing these pages, if
your indignation is not stirred against the man's rashness, you will at
least join with me in laughing at his prodigious follies, and will
learn, at the same time, that the testimonies of men most distinguished
for learning are not to be rated so highly as to supersede personal
examination when opportunity permits.

Christ first of all became known from Persia. For nothing escapes the
learned jurists of that country, who investigate all things with the
utmost care. The facts,<sup>[3](footnote/fn21.htm#P2183_622801.md)</sup>
therefore, which are inscribed upon the golden
plates,<sup>[4](footnote/fn21.htm#P2184_622884.md)</sup> and laid up in the
royal temples, I shall record; for it is from the temples there, and the
priests connected with them, that the name of Christ has been heard of.
Now there is a temple there to Juno, surpassing even the royal palace,
which temple Cyrus, that prince instructed in all piety, built, and in
which he dedicated in honour of the gods golden and silver statues, and
adorned them with precious stones,-that I may not waste words in a
profuse description of that ornamentation. Now about that time (as the
records on the plates testify), the king having entered the temple, with
the view of getting an interpretation of certain dreams, was addressed
by the priest Prupupius thus: I congratulate thee, master: Juno has
conceived. And the king, smiling, said to him, Has she who is dead
conceived? And he said, Yes, she who was dead has come to life again,
and besets life. And the king said, What is this? explain it to me. And
he replied, In truth, master, the time for these things is at hand. For
during the whole night the images, both of gods and goddesses, continued
beating the-ground, saying to each other, Come, let us congratulate
Juno. And they say to me, Prophet, come forward; congratulate Juno, for
she has been embraced. And I said, How can she be embraced who no longer
exists? To which they reply, She has come to life again, and is no
longer called Juno,<sup>[5](footnote/fn21.htm#P2185_624459.md)</sup> but
Urania. For the mighty Sol has embraced her. Then the goddesses say to
the gods, making the matter plainer,
*Pege*<sup>[6](footnote/fn21.htm#P2186_624786.md)</sup> is she who is
embraced; for did not Juno espouse an artificer? And the gods say, That
she is rightly called *Pege*, we admit. Her name, moreover, is *Myria*;
for she bears in her womb, as in the deep, a vessel of a myriad talents'
burden. And as to this title Pege, let it be understood thus: This
stream of water sends forth the perennial stream of spirit,-a stream
containing but a single
fish,<sup>[7](footnote/fn21.htm#P2187_625217.md)</sup> taken with the hook
of Divinity, and sustaining the whole world with its flesh as though it
were in the sea. You have well said, She has an artificer \[in
espousal\]; but by that espousal she does not bear an artificer on an
equality with herself. For this artificer who is born, the son of the
chief artificer, framed by his excellent skill the roof of the third
heavens, and established by his word this lower world, with its
threefold sphere<sup>[8](footnote/fn21.htm#P2188_626003.md)</sup> of
habitation.

Thus, then, the statues disputed with each other concerning Juno and
Pege, and \[at length\] with one voice they said: When the day is
finished. we all, gods and goddesses, shall know the matter clearly.
Now, therefore, master, tarry for the rest of the day. For the matter
shall certainly come to pass. For that which emerges is no common
affair.

And when the king abode there and watched the statues, the harpers of
their own accord began to strike their harps, and the misses to sing;
and whatsoever creatures were within, whether quadruped or fowl, in
silver and gold, uttered their several voices. And as the king
shuddered, and was filled with great fear, he was about to retire. For
he could not endure the spontaneous tumult. The priest therefore said to
him, Remain, O king, for the full revelation is at hand which the God of
gods has chosen to declare to us.

And when these things were said, the roof was opened, and a bright star
descended and stood above the pillar of Pege, and a voice was heard to
this effect: Sovereign Pege, the mighty Son has sent me to make the
announcement to you, and at the same time to do you service in
parturition, designing blameless nuptials with you, O mother of the
chief of all ranks of being, bride of the triune Deity. And the child
begotten by extraordinary generation is called the *Beginning* and the
*End*,-the beginning of salvation, and the end of perdition.

And when this word was spoken, all the statues fell upon their faces,
that of Pege alone standing, on which also a royal diadem was found
placed, having on its upper side a star set in a carbuncle and an
emerald. And on its lower side the star rested.

And the king forthwith gave orders to bring in all the interpreters of
prodigies, and the sages who were under his dominion. And when all the
heralds sped with their proclamations, all these assembled in the
temple. And when they saw the star above Pege, and the diadem with the
star and the stone, and the statues lying on the floor, they said: O
king, a root (offspring) divine and princely has risen, bearing the
image of the King of heaven and earth. For Pege-Myria is the daughter of
the Bethlehemite Pege. And the diadem is the mark of a king, and the
star is a celestial announcement of portents to fall on the earth. Out
of Judah has arisen a kingdom which shall subvert all the memorials of
the Jews. And the prostration of the gods upon the floor prefigured the
end of their honour. For he who comes, being of more ancient dignity,
shall displace all the recent. Now therefore, O king, send to Jerusalem.
For you will find the Christ of the Omnipotent God borne in bodily form
in the bodily arms of a woman. And the star remained above the statue of
Pege, called the Celestial, until the wise men came forth, and then it
went with them.

And then, in the depth of evening, Dionysus appeared in the temple,
unaccompanied by the Satyrs, and said to the images: Pege is not one of
us, but stands far above us, in that she gives birth to a man whose
conception is in divine
fashion.<sup>[9](footnote/fn21.htm#P2195_629093.md)</sup> O priest
Prupupius! what dost thou tarrying here? An action, indicated in
writings of old,<sup>[10](footnote/fn21.htm#P2196_629213.md)</sup> has come
upon us, and we shall be convicted as false by a person of power and
energy.<sup>[11](footnote/fn21.htm#P2197_629315.md)</sup> Wherein we have
been deceivers, we have been deceivers; and wherein we have ruled, we
have ruled. No longer give we oracular responses. Gone from us is our
honour. Without glory and reward are we become. There is One, and One
only, who receives again at the hands of all His proper honour. For the
rest, be not disturbed.<sup>[12](footnote/fn21.htm#P2198_629654.md)</sup>
No longer shall the Persians exact tribute of earth and sky. For He who
established these things is at hand, to bring practical
tribute<sup>[13](footnote/fn21.htm#P2199_629857.md)</sup> to Him who sent
Him, to renew the ancient image, and to put image with image, and bring
the dissimilar to similarity. Heaven rejoices with earth, and earth
itself exults at receiving matter of exultation from heaven. Things
which have not happened above, have happened on earth beneath. He whom
the order of the blessed has not seen, is seen by the order of the
miserable. Flame threatens those; dew attends these. To Myria is given
the blessed lot of bearing Pege in Bethlehem, and of conceiving grace of
grace. Judaea has seen its bloom, and this country is fading. To
Gentiles and aliens, salvation is come; to the wretched, relief is
ministered abundantly. With right do women dance, and say, Lady Pege,
Spring-bearer, thou mother of the heavenly constellation. Thou cloud
that bringest us dew after heat, remember thy de pendants, O mistress.

The king then, without delay, sent some of the Magi under his dominion
with gifts, the star showing them the way. And when they returned, they
narrated to the men of that time those same things which were also
written on the plates of gold, and which were to the following effect:-

When we came to Jerusalem, the sign, together with our arrival, roused
all the people. How is this, say they, that wise men of the Persians are
here, and that along with them there is this strange stellar phenomenon?
And the chief of the Jews interrogated us in this way: What is this that
attends you,<sup>[14](footnote/fn22.htm#P2202_631314.md)</sup> and with
what purpose are you here? And we said: He whom ye call Messias is born.
And they were confounded, and dared not withstand us. But they said to
us, By the justice of Heaven, tell us what ye know of this matter. And
we made answer to them: Ye labour under unbelief; and neither without an
oath nor with an oath do ye believe us, but ye follow your own heedless
counsel. For the Christ, the Son of the Most High, is born, and He is
the subverter of your law and synagogues. And therefore is it that,
struck with this most excellent response as with a
dart,<sup>[15](footnote/fn22.htm#P2203_631948.md)</sup> ye hear in
bitterness this name which has come upon you suddenly.And they then,
taking counsel together, urged us to accept their gifts, and tell to
none that such an event had taken place in that land of theirs, lest, as
they say, *a revolt rise against us*. But we replied: We have brought
gifts in His honour, with the view of proclaiming those mighty things
which we know to have happened in our country on occasion of His birth;
and do ye bid us take your bribes, and conceal the things which have
been communicated to us by the Divinity who is above the heavens, and
neglect the commandments of our proper King? And after urging many
considerations on us, they gave the matter up. And when the king of
Judaea sent for us and had some converse with us, and put to us certain
questions as to the statements we made to him, we acted in the same
manner, until he was thoroughly enraged at our replies. We left him
accordingly, without giving any greater heed to him than to any common
person.

And we came to that place then to which we were sent, and saw the mother
and the child, the star indicating to us the royal babe. And we said to
the mother: What art thou named, O renowned mother? And she says: Mary,
masters. And we said to her: Whence art thou
sprung?<sup>[16](footnote/fn22.htm#P2205_633267.md)</sup> And she replies:
From this district of the
Bethlehemites.<sup>[17](footnote/fn22.htm#P2206_633342.md)</sup> Then said
we: Hast thou not had a husband? And she answers: I was only betrothed
with a view to the marriage covenant, my thoughts being far removed from
this. For I had no mind to come to this. And while I was giving very
little concern to it, when a certain Sabbath dawned, and straightway at
the rising of the sun, an angel appeared to me bringing me suddenly the
glad tidings of a son. And in trouble I cried out, Be it not so to me,
Lord, for I have not a husband. And he persuaded me to believe, that by
the will of God I should have this son.

Then said we to her: Mother, mother, all the gods of the Persians have
called thee blessed. Thy glory is great; for thou art exalted above all
women of renown, and thou art shown to be more queenly than all queens.

The child, moreover, was seated on the ground, being, as she said, in
His second year, and having in part the likeness of His mother. And she
had long hands,<sup>[18](footnote/fn22.htm#P2209_634280.md)</sup> and a
body somewhat delicate; and her colour was like that of ripe
wheat;<sup>[19](footnote/fn22.htm#P2210_634471.md)</sup> and she was of a
round face, and had her hair bound up. And as we had along with us a
servant skilled in painting from the life, we brought with us to our
country a likeness of them both; and it was placed by our hand in the
sacred<sup>[20](footnote/fn22.htm#P2211_634725.md)</sup> temple, with this
inscription on it: To Jove the Sun, the mighty God, the King of Jesus,
the power of Persia dedicated this.

And taking the child up, each of us in turn, and bearing Him in our
arms, we saluted Him and worshipped Him, and presented to Him gold, and
myrrh, and frankincense, addressing Him thus: We gift Thee with Thine
own, O Jesus, Ruler of heaven. Ill would things unordered be ordered,
weft Thou not at hand. In no other way could things heavenly be brought
into conjunction with things earthly, but by Thy descent. Such service
cannot be discharged, if only the servant is sent us, as when the Master
Himself is present; neither can so much be achieved when the king sends
only his satraps to war, as when the king is there himself. It became
the wisdom of Thy system, that Thou shouldst deal in this manner with
men.<sup>[21](footnote/fn22.htm#P2213_635578.md)</sup>

And the child leaped and laughed at our caresses and words. And when we
had bidden the mother
farewell,<sup>[22](footnote/fn22.htm#P2215_635950.md)</sup> and when she
had shown us honour, and we had testified to her the reverence which
became us, we came again to the place in which we lodged. And at
eventide there appeared to us one of a terrible and fearful countenance,
saying: Get ye out quickly, lest ye be taken in a snare. And we in
terror said: And who is he, O divine leader, that plotteth against so
august an embassage? And he replied: Herod; but get you up straightway
and depart in safety and peace.

And we made speed to depart thence in all earnestness; and we reported
in Jerusalem all that we had seen. Behold, then, the great things that
we have told you regarding Christ; and we saw Christ our Saviour, who
was made known as both God and man. To Him be the glory and the power
unto the ages of the ages. Amen.
