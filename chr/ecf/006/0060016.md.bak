##  On the Trinity.

--------

Gregory Thaumaturgus, Bishop of Neo-Caesareia in
Pontus,<sup>[2](footnote/fn8.htm#P884_241656.md)</sup> near successor of
the apostles, in his discourse on the Trinity, speaks thus:-

I see in all three essentials-substance, genus, name. We speak of man,
servant, curator (*curatorem*),-man, by reason of substance; servant, by
reason of genus or condition; curator, by reason of denomination. We
speak also of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: these, however, are not
names which have only supervened at some after period, but they are
subsistences. Again, the denomination of *man* is not in actual fact a
denomination, but a substance common to men, and is the denomination
proper to all men. Moreover, names are such as these,-Adam, Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob: these, I say, are names. But the Divine Persons are names
indeed: and the names are still the persons; and the persons then
signify that which is and subsists,-which is the essence of God. The
name also of the nature signifies
subsistence;<sup>[3](footnote/fn8.htm#P886_242600.md)</sup> as if we should
speak of the *man*. All (the persons) are one nature, one essence, one
will, and are called the Holy Trinity; and these also are haines
subsistent, one nature in three persons, and one genus. But the person
of the Son is composite in its oneness (*unita est*), being one made up
of two, that is, of divinity and humanity together, which two constitute
one. Yet the divinity does not consequently receive any increment, but
the Trinity remains as it was. Nor does anything new befall the persons
even or the names, but these are eternal and without time. No one,
however, was sufficient to know these until the Son being made flesh
manifested them, saying: "Father, I have manifested Thy name to men;
glorify Thou me also, that they may know me as Thy
Son."<sup>[4](footnote/fn8.htm#P887_243472.md)</sup> And on the mount the
Father spake, and said, "This is my beloved
Son."<sup>[5](footnote/fn8.htm#P888_243560.md)</sup> And the same sent His
Holy Spirit at the Jordan. And thus it was declared to us that there is
an Eternal Trinity in equal honour. Besides, the generation of the Son
by the Father is incomprehensible and ineffable; and because it is
spiritual, its investigation becomes impracticable: for a spiritual
object can neither be understood nor traced by a corporeal object, for
that is far removed from human nature. We men know indeed the generation
proper to us, as also that of other objects; but a spiritual matter is
above human condition, neither can it in any manner be understood by the
minds of men. Spiritual substance can neither perish nor be dissolved;
ours, however, as is easy to understand, perishes and is dissolved. How,
indeed, could it be possible for man, who is limited on six sides-by
east, west, south, north, deep, and sky-understand a matter which is
above the skies, which is beneath the deeps, which stretches beyond the
north and south, and which is present in every place, and fills all
vacuity? But if, indeed, we are able to scrutinize spiritual substance,
its excellence truly would be undone. Let us consider what is done in
our body; and, furthermore, let us see whether it is in our power to
ascertain in what manner thoughts are born of the heart, and words of
the tongue, and the like. Now, if we can by no means apprehend things
that are done in ourselves, how could it ever be that we should
understand the mystery of the uncreated Creator, which goes beyond every
mind? Assuredly, if this mystery were one that could be penetrated by
man, the inspired John would by no means have affirmed this: "No man
hath seen God at any time."<sup>[6](footnote/fn8.htm#P889_245243.md)</sup>
He then, whom no man hath seen at any time,-whom can we reckon Him to
resemble, so that thereby we should understand His generation? And we,
indeed, without ambiguity apprehend that our soul dwells in us in union
with the body; but still, who has ever seen his own soul? who has been
able to discern its conjunction with his body? This one thing is all we
know certainly, that there is a soul within us conjoined with the body.
Thus, then, we reason and believe that the Word is begotten by the
Father, albeit we neither possess nor know the clear *rationale* of the
fact. The Word Himself is before every creature-eternal froth the
Eternal, like spring from spring, and light from light. The vocable
*Word*, indeed, belongs to those three genera of words which are named
in Scripture, and which are not substantial,-namely, the word
*conceived*,<sup>[7](footnote/fn8.htm#P890_246100.md)</sup> the word
*uttered*,<sup>[8](footnote/fn8.htm#P891_246140.md)</sup> and the word
*articulated*.<sup>[9](footnote/fn8.htm#P892_246182.md)</sup> The word
*conceived*, certainly, is not substantial. The word *uttered*, again,
is that voice which the prophets hear from God, or the prophetic speech
itself; and even this is not substantial. And, lastly, the word
*articulated* is the speech of man formed forth in air (*aere
efformatus*), composed of terms, which also is not
substantial.<sup>[10](footnote/fn8.htm#P893_246532.md)</sup> But the Word
of God is substantial, endowed with an exalted and enduring nature, and
is eternal with Himself, and is inseparable from Him, and can never fall
away, but shall remain in an everlasting union. This Word created heaven
and earth, and in Him were all things made. He is the arm and the power
of God, never to be separated from the Father, in virtue of an
indivisible nature, and, together with the Father, He is without
beginning. This Word took our substance of the Virgin Mary; and in so
far as He is spiritual indeed, He is indivisibly equal with the Father;
but in so far as He is corporeal, He is in like manner inseparably equal
with us. And, again, in so far as He is spiritual, He supplies in the
same equality (*aequiparat*) the Holy Spirit, inseparably and without
limit. Neither were there two natures, but only one nature of the Holy
Trinity before the incarnation of the Word, the Son; and the nature of
the Trinity remained one also after the incarnation of the Son. But if
any one, moreover, believes that any increment has been given to the
Trinity by reason of the assumption of humanity by the Word, he is an
alien from us, and from the ministry of the Catholic and Apostolic
Church. This is the perfect, holy, Apostolic faith of the holy God.
Praise to the Holy Trinity for ever through the ages of the ages. Amen.
