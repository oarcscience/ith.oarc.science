doubt, as to the ancestors of the Jewish race; the fatherly character of
Abraham, the filial character of Isaac, and the missionary offices of
Jacob-whose wisdom and organizing faculties are so
conspicuous-interpreting, in some degree, "the Holy and Consubstantial
Trinity." This seems to be hinted, indeed, in the formula, "I am the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Isaac's
submission to be sacrificed upon Mount Moriah, and Jacob's begetting and
sending forth the twelve patriarchs, singularly identify them as types
of the Atoning Son and the regenerating Spirit, whose gifts and mission
were imparted to the twelve Apostles.\]
