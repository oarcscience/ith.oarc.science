<SUP>47 </SUP>So the ms., both Rom. edd., Hild., and Oehler, reading <I>quamvis poenam</I>; Gelenius, Canterus, Elm, and Oberth&uuml;r omit <I>vis</I>, and the other edd. <I>v</I>, i.e., "as to what punishment the Egyptian," etc. This must refer to the cases in which the sacred bull, having outlived the term of twenty-five years, was secretly killed by the priests, while the people were taught that it had thrown itself into the water.</P>

<SUP>50 </SUP>So the ms., first four edd., and Oberth&uuml;r, reading <I>Toli</I>, corrected <I>Oli</I> in the others, from Servius (<I>ad. Aen.</I>, viii. 345). Arnobius himself gives the form Aulus, i.e. Olus, immediately below, so that it is probably correct.</P>

<SUP>53 </SUP>The ms., LB., Hild., and Oehler read Aulus, and, acc. to Oehler, all other edd. <I>Tolus</I>. Orelli, however, reads <I>Olus</I>, as above.</P>

<P><A NAME="P8109_2553009"></A>
<SUP>54 </SUP>The ms. and both Roman edd. read <I>germani servuli vita</I> without meaning, corrected as above by Gelenius, Canterus, Elm., and Oberth&uuml;r, <I>ut a g. servulo</I>, and <I>ut a g. servulis</I>-"by the slaves," in the others, except Oehler who reads as above, <I>g. servulo ut.</I></P>

<P><A NAME="P8131_2559692"></A>
<SUP>73 </SUP>As the appearance of the moon is the same in some of its phases as in others, it is clear that Arnobius cannot mean that it has thirty distinct forms. We must therefore suppose that he is either speaking very loosely of change upon change day after day, or that he is referring to some of the lunar theories of the ancients, such as that a new moon is created each day, and that its form is thus ever new (<I>Lucr.</I>, v. 729-748).</P>

<SUP>77 </SUP>The ms. reads <I>leon-e-s torvissimam faciem</I>, emended, as above, <I>leonis t. f.</I>, in LB., Orelli, Hild., and Oehler, and <I>l. torvissima facie</I>-"lions of very stern face," in the others. Nourry supposes that the reference is to the use of lions, or lion-headed figures, as architectural ornaments on temples (cf. the two lions rampant surmounting the gate of Mycenae), but partially coincides in the view of Elm., that mixed figures are meant, such as are described by Tertullian and Minucius Felix (ch. 28: "You deify gods made up of a goat and a lion, and with the faces of lions and of dogs"). The epithet <I>frugifer</I>, however, which was applied to the Egyptian Osiris, the Persian Mithras, and Bacchus, who were also represented as lions, makes it probable that the reference is to symbolic statues of the sun.</P>

<P><A NAME="P8136_2561760"></A>

<P><A NAME="P8138_2562066"></A>
<SUP>80 </SUP>The ms. and both Roman edd. read unintelligibly <I>sanquineo decotoro</I>, for which <I>s. de colore</I>, as above, has been suggested by Canterus, with the approval of Heraldus.</P>

<P><A NAME="P8139_2562357"></A>
<SUP>81 </SUP>The ms. here inserts <I>puetuitate</I>, for which no satisfactory emendation has been proposed. The early edd. read <I>pituitate</I>, a word for which there is no authority, while LB. gives <I>potus aviditate</I>-"drunk with avidity"-both being equally hopeless.</P>

<SUP>82 </SUP>ms. <I>sic</I>, corrected by Gelenius <I>si</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="P8141_2562822"></A>
<SUP>83 </SUP>So Meursius, <I>ac dicere</I>, for ms. <I>-cidere.</I></P>

<P><A NAME="P8143_2563105"></A>
<SUP>84 </SUP>It is worthy of notice that although in this passage, as often elsewhere, Arnobius adheres pretty closely to the argument proposed by Clemens Alexandrinus, he even in such passages sometimes differs from it, and not at random. Thus Clement speaks merely of a "stone," and Arnobius of an "unshaped stone." The former expression harmonizes with the words of Maximus Tyrius (<I>Serm.</I>, xxxviii. p. 225, Steph.), "The Arabians worship I know not whom, but the image which I saw was a square stone;" while Suidas (K&uuml;ster's ed., s. v. <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>qeu\s !Arhj</FONT>) agrees with Arnobius in calling it a "stone, black, square, unfashioned" (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>a0tu/pwtoj</FONT>). This is the more noteworthy, as at times Arnobius would almost seem to be following Clement blindly. [See Clement, cap. iv. vol. ii. p. 184, this series.]</P>

<P><A NAME="P8144_2563962"></A>
<SUP>85 </SUP>So Arnobius renders Clement's <I>Cithaeronian Hera.</I></P>

<P><A NAME="P8145_2564029"></A>
<SUP>86 </SUP>So corrected in the notes of Canterus from Clem. for the ms. reading <I>Carios</I>, retained by the first four edd. and Elmenh. In Icaria there was a temple of Diana called <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>Tauropo/lion</FONT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="P8146_2564459"></A>
<SUP>87 </SUP>The ms. and first four edd. read <I>p-uteum</I>-"a well," corrected <I>plut.</I>, as above, by Gifanius, and in the notes of Canterus. </P>
