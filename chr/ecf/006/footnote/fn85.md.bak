<span id="P8500_2696349"></span> <sup>177</sup> Lit., "of."

<span id="P8501_2697078"></span> <sup>178</sup> Lit., "that effigies
have been far removed from them." This may be understood, either as
meaning that the gods had not visible form at all, or, as above, that
their likenesses made by men showed no resemblance.

<span id="P8503_2697685"></span> <sup>179</sup> 50 in Orelli.

<span id="P8504_2697983"></span> <sup>180</sup> It is important to
notice the evidence in this one sentence of haste and want of revision.
In the first line we find a genitive (*discordiarum*-"dissensions"), but
not the noun on which it depends; and in the apodosis a verb
(*disjunctas esse*-"have been removed," i.e., "are remote") has no
subject, although its gender imperatively requires that *has res*, or
some such words, be supplied. One omission might have been easily
ascribed to a slip on the part of the copyist; but two omissions such as
these occurring so closely, must, it would seem, be assigned to the
impetuous disregard of *minutiae* with which Arnobius blocked out a
conclusion which was never carefully revised. (Cf. Appendix, note 1, and
p. 539, n. 8.) The importance of such indications is manifest in forming
an opinion on the controversy as to this part of the work.

<span id="P8505_2699262"></span> <sup>181</sup> Lit., "are of...those
meeting the functions of mortality," *obeunti-um*, corrected by Gelenius
(according to Orelli) for the ms. *-bus,* retained, though
unintelligible, by Canterus, Oberth., and Hild.

<span id="P8508_2700425"></span> <sup>184</sup> Lit., "some time."

<span id="P8512_2701383"></span> <sup>187</sup> Lit., "divine things."

<span id="P8513_2701606"></span> <sup>188</sup> So the ms., both Roman
edd., Hild., and Oehler, reading *promptae*; corrected
*praesumptae*-"taken for granted," in the rest.

<span id="P8514_2702085"></span> <sup>189</sup> i.e., offerings to
parents, as the name implies, and other relatives who were dead.

1, Appendix, p. 539, *infra*\]

<span id="P8522_2705290"></span> <sup>195</sup> Lit., "added evil
heavier than evil."

<span id="P8523_2705478"></span> <sup>196</sup> So later edd., reading
*vaderet* from the margin of Ursinus, while the first three retain the
ms. reading *suaderet*-"persuade."

<span id="P8524_2705652"></span> <sup>197</sup> i.e., the slave writhing
under the scourge.

<span id="P8525_2706147"></span> <sup>198</sup> Lit., "of so great
power."

<span id="P8526_2706303"></span> <sup>199</sup> i.e., Jupiter.

<span id="P8533_2708618"></span> <sup>204</sup> 38 in Orelli.

<span id="P8534_2709076"></span> <sup>205</sup> So the ms., LB., Hild.,
and Oehler, reading *volu-p-tates*, i.e., the games and feasts spoken of
previously; the other edd. read *-n-*-"wishes."

<span id="P8535_2709501"></span> <sup>206</sup> Oehler explains
*frustra* by *otiose*-"who was leisurely delighted," but there is no
reason why it should not have its usual meaning, as above. \[See note 1,
Appendix, p. 539.\]

<span id="P8536_2709741"></span> <sup>207</sup> i.e., from heaven.
Instead of *e-vocari*, however, Heraldus has proposed *a-*-"be
diverted."

<span id="P8537_2710070"></span> <sup>208</sup> Lit., "unfolding."

<span id="P8538_2711335"></span> <sup>209</sup> Lit., "was in the cause
of the vicious dancer."

<span id="P8540_2711764"></span> <sup>210</sup> 39 in Orelli.

<span id="P8541_2712196"></span> <sup>211</sup> So all edd., rejecting
*s* from ms. *contemptu-s*.

<span id="P8542_2712935"></span> <sup>212</sup> Lit., "draughts of air."

<span id="P8543_2713502"></span> <sup>213</sup> So, by omitting two
letters, all edd. except 1st and Ursinus, which retain ms.
*adult-er-ae*-"adulterous."

<span id="P8544_2713837"></span> <sup>214</sup> Lit., "light."

<span id="P8546_2713904"></span> <sup>215</sup> 40 in Orelli. The ms.,
1st edd., and Ursinus want *si*.

<span id="P8547_2714030"></span> <sup>216</sup> Lit., "and restored."
\[Conf. *Pont. Max.* here named, with vol. iv. p. 74.\]

<span id="P8548_2714163"></span> <sup>217</sup> The ms. and Ursinus read
*reddere-t*-"if he was to restore;" corrected, as above, by omission of
*t.*

<span id="P8549_2714987"></span> <sup>218</sup> i.e., if he is a god.
Cf. iii. 20; \[specially, note 3, p. 469\].

<span id="P8550_2715890"></span> <sup>219</sup> Lit., "the necks of."

<span id="P8554_2717042"></span> <sup>223</sup> The ms. reads
*rett-ulit*, emended *ret-*-"gave back," i.e., got rid of, by 1st ed.
and Ursinus; and *rep-*, as above, by Gelenius and others.

<span id="P8556_2717565"></span> <sup>224</sup> 41 in Orelli. \[See
Appendix, note 1, p. 539.\]

<span id="P8557_2717947"></span> <sup>225</sup> In the ms. and both
Roman edd. the section translated on p. 539 is inserted here. Ursinus,
however (pp. 210-211), followed by Heraldus (312-313), enclosed it in
brackets, and marked it with asterisks. In all other edd. it is either
given as an appendix, or wholly rejected.

<span id="P8558_2719137"></span> <sup>226</sup> Lit., "sublimity."

<span id="P8560_2719825"></span> <sup>227</sup> 42 in Orelli.

*et* for ms. *ut* (according to Crusius).

<span id="P8562_2720243"></span> <sup>229</sup> Lit., "restoration be
supplied to his strength."

<span id="P8563_2721120"></span> <sup>230</sup> So Gelenius, merely
adding *t* to the ms. *posse*. The passage is, however, very doubtful.

<span id="P8564_2721392"></span> <sup>231</sup> Lit., "how weakly and
feeble it is said."

<span id="P8565_2721770"></span> <sup>232</sup> These words, *non debuit
oculorum negare conspectui*, should, Orelli thinks, be omitted; and
certainly their connection with the rest of the sentence is not very
apparent.

<span id="P8566_2722029"></span> <sup>233</sup> Lit., "he was, and such
as he had learned that he was, contained in the power of his divinity."

<span id="P8567_2722349"></span> <sup>234</sup> Lit., "to ambiguous
contradictions."

<span id="P8569_2722502"></span> <sup>235</sup> 43 in Orelli.

<span id="P8570_2722984"></span> <sup>236</sup> Lit., "if your services
of certain persons are certain," i.e., if these facts on which your
worship is built are well ascertained.

<span id="P8571_2723560"></span> <sup>237</sup> What species of snake
this was, is not known; the Latin is therefore retained, as the sentence
insists on the distinction.

<span id="P8572_2723787"></span> <sup>238</sup> *Anguem.*

<span id="P8573_2723824"></span> <sup>239</sup> *Serpentem.*

<span id="P8574_2724007"></span> <sup>240</sup> Lit., "bearing himself
on feet, nor unfolding below his own goings."

<span id="P8575_2724183"></span> <sup>241</sup> Lit., "to a."

<span id="P8576_2724633"></span> <sup>242</sup> So Hild. and Oehler,
reading *labefac-t-amus* for the ms. *-i-*.

<span id="P8577_2725220"></span> <sup>243</sup> This sentence alone is
sufficient to prove that these chapters were never carefully revised by
their author, as otherwise so glaring repetitions would certainly have
been avoided.

<span id="P8578_2725717"></span> <sup>244</sup> Here the ms. and both
Roman edd. insert the last clause, "what...forests."

<span id="P8580_2726003"></span> <sup>245</sup> 44 in Orelli.

<span id="P8582_2727672"></span> <sup>246</sup> 45 in Orelli.

<span id="P8583_2727767"></span> <sup>247</sup> Lit., "wanting."

<span id="P8584_2728157"></span> <sup>248</sup> The ms., 1st ed., Hild.,
and Oehler read *gener-ent*, corrected in the rest, as above, *-arent.*

<span id="P8585_2728292"></span> <sup>249</sup> Lit., "all wicked and
distinguished by no diversity."

<span id="P8586_2728463"></span> <sup>250</sup> Lit., "the human race
has been mixed in," etc.

<span id="P8587_2729410"></span> <sup>251</sup> So all edd., reading *vi
morbi*, except Hild., who retains the ms. *vi urbi*, in which case the
italics should denote "of the disease," instead of "to the city." The
construction, however, seems to make it impossible to adhere to the ms..

<span id="P8588_2729755"></span> <sup>252</sup> Lit., "to have erred
much from."

<span id="P8590_2729924"></span> <sup>253</sup> 46 In Orelli.

<span id="P8591_2730225"></span> <sup>254</sup> Lit., "from the
possession of Italy."

<span id="P8592_2730801"></span> <sup>255</sup> So all edd. to Orelli,
adding *-em* to the ms. *quid*. \[See, concerning Pessinus, p. 492,
*supra*.\]

<span id="P8593_2731272"></span> <sup>256</sup> Lit., "a face too little
expressed with imitation."

<span id="P8595_2731335"></span> <sup>257</sup> 47 in Orelli.

<span id="P8596_2731579"></span> <sup>258</sup> Lit., "did a stone
drive," etc.

<span id="P8597_2732245"></span> <sup>259</sup> Lit. "moved by."

<span id="P8598_2732306"></span> <sup>260</sup> So the ms. and edd.;
but, on account of the unnecessary repetition, Ursinus proposed to
delete *atri*. Unger (*Anal. Propert.*, p. 87) has suggested very
happily *arti*-"of confined, i.e., small body.'"

<span id="P8599_2732630"></span> <sup>261</sup> *Vim*, suggested by
Orelli, and adopted by Hild. and Oehler.
