<span id="P4768_1430626"></span> <sup>70</sup> Many writings of the
ancients, as Cardinal Mai has remarked, may be disinterred from the
Oriental manuscripts in the Vatican library, some of which have been
brought to light by that eminent scholar. In an Arabic ms. he discovered
a large portion of the following discourse by St. Alexander, the
patriarch of Alexandria, which he afterwards met with entire in the
Syrian Vatican manuscript 368. The Greek version being lost, Mai, with
the assistance of the erudite Maronites, Matthaeus Sciahuanus, and
Franciscus Mehasebus, translated the discourse into Latin, and his
version has been chiefly followed in the following translation. Of its
genuineness there is no doubt, and it is quite worthy of a place among
his other writings.

<span id="P4771_1433313"></span> <sup>71</sup> Gen. i. 26.

<span id="P4776_1438637"></span> <sup>72</sup> The passage, as far as to
"rise again the third day from the dead," is generally marked with
inverted commas, and Mai remarks that it had been already brought to
light by him under the name of the same Alexander, in the *Spicileg.
Roman.*, vol. iii. p. 699, amongst some extracts of the Fathers from the
Arabic Vatican Codex, 101, in which is contained the celebrated
Monophysite work entitled *Fides Patrum.* It is established therefore
that this discourse was written in Greek by Alexander, and afterwards
translated not only into the Syriac, but also into the Arabic language.
