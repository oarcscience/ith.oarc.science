<span id="P6405_1956693"></span> <sup>47</sup> \[This section (8)
appears as a "Preface" to the Edinburgh edition.\]

<span id="P6417_1956973"></span> <sup>1</sup> The words *insanire,
bacchari*, refer to the appearance of the ancient seers when under the
influence of the deity. So Virgil says, *Insanam vatem aspicies*
(*Aen.*, iii. 443), and, *Bacchatur vates* (*Aen.*, vi. 78). The meaning
is, that they make their asseverations with all the confidence of a seer
when filled, as he pretended, with the influence of the god.

<span id="P6418_1957382"></span> <sup>2</sup> *Et velut quiddam promptum
ex oraculo dicere*, i.e., to declare a matter with boldness and majesty,
as if most certain and undoubted.

<span id="P6419_1958167"></span> <sup>3</sup> *Popularia verba*, i.e.,
rumours arising from the ignorance of the common people.

<span id="P6420_1958570"></span> <sup>4</sup> The Christians were
regarded as "public enemies," and were so called.

<span id="P6422_1959030"></span> <sup>5</sup> Or, "all party zeal."

<span id="P6423_1959680"></span> <sup>6</sup> So Meursius,-the ms.
reading is *inusitatum*, "extraordinary."

<span id="P6424_1961262"></span> <sup>7</sup> So Gelenius; ms.,
*coartatur*, "pressed together."

<span id="P6426_1963845"></span> <sup>8</sup> Or, "race," *gens*, i.e.,
the Christian people.

<span id="P6427_1963909"></span> <sup>9</sup> The verb *mereri*, used in
this passage, has in Roman writers the idea of merit or excellence of
some kind in a person, in virtue of which he is deemed worthy of some
favour or advantage; but in ecclesiastical Latin it means, as here, to
gain something by the mere favour of God, without any merit of one's
own.

<span id="P6428_1965682"></span> <sup>10</sup> See Livy, i. 31, etc.;
and Pliny, *Nat. Hist.*, ii. 38.

<span id="P6429_1965922"></span> <sup>11</sup> The ms. reads, *flumina*
cognoverimus ingentia *lim*-in-*is ingentia siccatis*, "that mighty
rivers shrunk up, leaving the mud," etc.

<span id="P6430_1966768"></span> <sup>12</sup> So Tertullian,
*Apologet.*, 40, says,-"We have read that the islands Hiera, Anaphe,
Delos, Rhodes, and Cos were destroyed, together with many human beings."

<span id="P6432_1967088"></span> <sup>13</sup> Arnobius, no doubt,
speaks of the story of Phaethon, as told by Ovid; on which, cf. Plato,
*Tim.*, st. p. 22.

<span id="P6433_1967414"></span> <sup>14</sup> Nourry thinks that
reference is here made to the contests of gladiators and athletes with
lions and other beasts in the circus. But it is more likely that the
author is thinking of African tribes who were harassed by lions. Thus
Aelian (*de Nat Anim.*, xvii. 24) tells of a Libyan people, the Nomaei,
who were entirely destroyed by lions.

<span id="P6434_1967844"></span> <sup>15</sup> The city of Amyclae in
Italy is referred to, which was destroyed by serpents.

<span id="P6436_1968379"></span> <sup>16</sup> In the *Timaeus* of
Plato, c. vi. st. p. 24, an old priest of Saïs, in Egypt, is represented
as telling Solon that in times long gone by the Athenians were a very
peaceful and very brave people, and that 9,000 years before that time
they had overcome a mighty host which came rushing from the Atlantic
Sea, and which threatened to subjugate all Europe and Asia. The sea was
then navigable, and in front of the pillars of Hercules (Strait of
Gibraltar) lay an island larger than Africa and Asia together: from it
travellers could pass to other islands, and from these again to the
opposite continent. In this island great kings arose, who made
themselves masters of the whole island, as well as of other islands, and
parts of the continent. Having already possessions in Libya and Europe,
which they wished to increase, they gathered an immense host; but it was
repelled by the Athenians. Great earthquakes and storms ensued, in which
the island of Atlantis was submerged, and the sea ever after rendered
impassable by shoals of mud produced by the sunken island. For other
forms of this legend, and explanations of it, see Smith's *Dictionary of
Geography*, under *Atlantis*; \[also *Ancient America*, p. 175, Harpers,
1872. This volume, little known, seems to me "stranger than fiction,"
and far more interesting\].

<span id="P6438_1971407"></span> <sup>17</sup> Cf. Matt. v. 39.

<span id="P6440_1972507"></span> <sup>18</sup> The ms. here inserts a
mark of interrogation.

<span id="P6441_1972924"></span> <sup>19</sup> So the ms. *si facto et*,
corrected, however, by a later copyist. *si facio ut*, "if I cause
that," etc.

<span id="P6443_1974773"></span> <sup>20</sup> Plato, *Tim.*, st. p. 22.

<span id="P6447_1976838"></span> <sup>21</sup> "To
analyze"-*dissolvere*- is in the ms. marked as spurious.

<span id="P6448_1977112"></span> <sup>22</sup> In the ms. we find "to
chill and numb"-*congelare, constringere*; but the last word, too, is
marked as spurious.

<span id="P6449_1977337"></span> <sup>23</sup> ms. *sustinere* (marked
as a gloss), "to sustain;" *perferre*, "to endure."

<span id="P6452_1978999"></span> <sup>24</sup> See Introduction.

<span id="P6453_1979066"></span> <sup>25</sup> \[Our author thus
identifies himself with Christians, and was, doubtless, baptized when he
wrote these words.\]

<span id="P6454_1979624"></span> <sup>26</sup> *Sine ullis feriis*, a
proverbial expression, "without any holidays;" i.e. without any
intermixture of good.

<span id="P6456_1980363"></span> <sup>27</sup> For *qui durare* Ursinus
would read *quiret durare*; but this seems to have no ms. authority,
though giving better sense and an easier construction.

<span id="P6458_1980778"></span> <sup>28</sup> That is, unsuccessfully.

<span id="P6460_1981463"></span> <sup>29</sup> *Alemanni*, i.e., the
Germans; hence the French *Allemagne.* The ms. has *Alamanni.*

<span id="P6461_1982000"></span> <sup>30</sup> \["Innumerable
Christians:" let this be noted.\]

<span id="P6462_1982092"></span> <sup>31</sup> The *Gaetuli* and
*Tinguitani* were African tribes. For *Tinguitanos*, another reading is
*tunc Aquitanos*; but *Tinguitanos* is much to be preferred on every
ground.

<span id="P6467_1985779"></span> <sup>32</sup> The ms. reads *at*,
"but."

<span id="P6468_1986117"></span> <sup>33</sup> *Defendere* is added in
the ms., but marked as a gloss.

<span id="P6469_1986521"></span> <sup>34</sup> *Consumere* is in like
manner marked as a gloss.

<span id="P6470_1986740"></span> <sup>35</sup> So Orelli, for the ms.
*judicationis*, "judgment."

<span id="P6474_1988245"></span> <sup>36</sup> The carelessness of some
copyist makes the ms. read *ve*-st-*ri*, "your," corrected as above by
Ursinus.

<span id="P6475_1989018"></span> <sup>37</sup> So Ursinus, followed by
Heraldus, LB., and Orelli, for the ms. *errores*, which Stewechius would
change into *errones*-"vagrants"-referring to the spirits wandering over
the earth: most other edd., following Gelenius, read, "called demigods,
that these indeed"-*daemonas appellat, et hos*, etc.

<span id="P6477_1989911"></span> <sup>38</sup> So the ms.,which is
corrected in the first ed. "us to be willing"-*nos velle*: Stewechius
reads, "us to be making good progress, are envious, enraged, and cry
aloud," etc.-*nos belle provenire compererunt, invident, indignantur,
declamitantque*, etc.; to both of which it is sufficient objection that
they do not improve the passage by their departure from the ms..

<span id="P6479_1992295"></span> <sup>39</sup> A beautiful appeal, and
one sufficient to show that our author was no longer among
catechumens.\]

<span id="P6481_1993219"></span> <sup>40</sup> So LB. and Orelli; but
the ms. reads, "himself to be like *a god* by *his* prophets," etc.-*se
esse similem profiteatur in vatibus.*

<span id="P6482_1993378"></span> <sup>41</sup> So corrected by Pithoeus
for the ms. *profanus.*

<span id="P6485_1995553"></span> <sup>42</sup> \[Evidences of our
author's Christian *status* abound in this fine passage.\]

<span id="P6487_1995693"></span> <sup>43</sup> So Gelenius, followed by
Orelli and others, for the ms., reading *divini interpretes viri*
(instead of *juris*)-"'O men, interpreters of the sacred and divine,"
which is retained by the 1st ed., Hildebrand, and Oehler.

<span id="P6488_1995998"></span> <sup>44</sup> Aii Locutii. Shortly
before the Gallic invasion, B.C. 390, a voice was heard at the dead of
night announcing the approach of the Gauls, but the warning was
unheeded. After the departure of the Gauls, the Romans dedicated an
altar and sacred enclosure to Aius Locutius, or Loquens, i.e., "The
Announcing Speaker," at a spot on the Via Nova, where the voice was
heard. The ms. reads *aiaceos boetios*, which Gelenius emended Aios
Locutios.

<span id="P6489_1996458"></span> <sup>45</sup> So emended by Ursinus for
the ms. *libentinos*, which is retained in the 1st ed., and by Gelenius,
Canterus, and others. Cf. iv. 9, where Libentina is spoken of as
presiding over lusts.

<span id="P6490_1996884"></span> <sup>46</sup> As a soul was assigned to
each individual at his birth, so a genius was attributed to a state. The
genius of the Roman people was often represented on ancient coins.

<span id="P6491_1997773"></span> <sup>47</sup> Thus the Athenians paid
honours to Leaena, the Romans to Acca Laurentia and Flora.

<span id="P6492_1998024"></span> <sup>48</sup> The superstitions of the
Egyptians are here specially referred to.

<span id="P6493_1998753"></span> <sup>49</sup> That is, by whose
pleasure and at whose command they are preserved from annihilation.

<span id="P6494_1999130"></span> <sup>50</sup> So Orelli, adopting a
conjecture of Meursius, for the ms. *nobis.*

<span id="P6495_1999294"></span> <sup>51</sup> That is, not
self-existent, but sprung from something previously in being.

<span id="P6497_2000128"></span> <sup>52</sup> *Columen* is here
regarded by some as equal to *culmen*; but the term "pillar" makes a
good sense likewise.

<span id="P6498_2000744"></span> <sup>53</sup> This is according to the
doctrine of Pythagoras, Plato, Origen, and others, who taught that the
souls of men first existed in heavenly beings, and that on account of
sins of long standing they were transferred to earthly bodies to super
punishment. Cf. Clem. Alex. *Strom.* iii. p. 433.
