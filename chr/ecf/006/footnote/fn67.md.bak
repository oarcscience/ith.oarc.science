<span id="P6700_2101055"></span> <sup>47</sup> Arnobius overstates the
fact here. In the passage referred to (*Th.*, st. p. 158), Socrates is
represented as developing the Protagorean theory from its author's
standpoint, not as stating his own opinions.

<span id="P6701_2101514"></span> <sup>48</sup> Lit., "by the stretching
out of rays and of light." This, the doctrine of the Stoics, is
naturally contrasted in the next clause with that of Epicurus.

<span id="P6702_2102085"></span> <sup>49</sup> Lit., "oil refuses to
suffer immersion into itself," i.e., of other fluids.

<span id="P6703_2102229"></span> <sup>50</sup> So LB., followed by
Orelli, reading *impenetrabil-em*, for the ms. *impenetrabil-is*, which
is corrected in both Roman edd. by Gelenius, Canterus, and Elmenhorst
*-e*, to agree with the subject *oleum*-"being impenetrable is ever,"
etc.

<span id="P6704_2102550"></span> <sup>51</sup> Lit., "a god."

<span id="P6705_2102649"></span> <sup>52</sup> So the edd., generally
reading *fatua* for the ms. *futura*, which is clearly corrupt.
Hildebrand turns the three adjectives into corresponding verbs, and
Heinsius emends *deliret* (ms. *-ra*) *et fatue et insane*-"dotes both
sillily and crazily." Arnobius here follows Lucr., iii. 445 sqq.

<span id="P6706_2103111"></span> <sup>53</sup> Lit., "something of
truth."

<span id="P6708_2103497"></span> <sup>54</sup> The ms. has *a
t-tor-o-s*, corrected by a later writer *a-c-tor-e-s*, which is received
in LB. and by Meursius and Orelli.

<span id="P6709_2104019"></span> <sup>55</sup> Lit., "unite marriage
partnerships."

<span id="P6710_2104201"></span> <sup>56</sup> Lit., "be safe and come."

<span id="P6711_2104550"></span> <sup>57</sup> Or, "in successive
battles"-*praeliorum successionibus.*

<span id="P6713_2104776"></span> <sup>58</sup> Lit., "with ocular
inspection, and held touched."

<span id="P6714_2105188"></span> <sup>59</sup> "Fire" is wanting in the
ms.

<span id="P6715_2105500"></span> <sup>60</sup> Arnobius here allows
himself to be misled by Cicero (*Tusc.*, i. 10), who explains
e0ntele/xeia as a kind of perpetual motion, evidently confusing it with
e0ndele/xeia (cf. Donaldson, *New Crat.*, ยง 339 sqq.), and represents
Aristotle as making it a fifth primary cause. The word has no such
meaning, and Aristotle invariably enumerates only four primary causes:
the material from which, the form in which, the power by which, and the
end for which anything exists (*Physics*, ii. 3; *Metaph.*, iv. 2,
etc.).

<span id="P6716_2106265"></span> <sup>61</sup> I.it., "with indivisible
bodies."

<span id="P6717_2106460"></span> <sup>62</sup> Pl.

<span id="P6718_2106484"></span> <sup>63</sup> So the ms., LB., and
Hildebrand, reading *Archesilae*, while the others read *Archesilao*,
forgetting that Arcesilas is the regular Latin form, although
Archesilaus is found.

<span id="P6720_2106794"></span> <sup>64</sup> *Sententiarum* is read in
the first ed. by Gelenius, Canterus, and Ursinus, and seems from Crusius
to be the ms. reading. The other edd., however, have received from the
margin of Ursinus the reading of the text, *sectarum.*

<span id="P6721_2107061"></span> <sup>65</sup> In the first ed., and
that of Ursinus, the reading is, *nonne apud ea*, "in those things which
they say, do they not say," etc., which Gelenius emended as in the text,
*nonne ipsa ea.*

<span id="P6722_2107401"></span> <sup>66</sup> Cf. Diog. Laert. ix. 9,
where Heraclitus is said to have taught that fire-the first
principle-condensing becomes water, water earth, and conversely; and on
Thales, Arist., *Met.*, A, 3, where, however, as in other places, Thales
is merely said to have referred the generation and maintenance of all
things to moisture, although by others he is represented as teaching the
doctrine ascribed to him above. Cf. Cic., *de Nat. Deor.*, i. 10, and
Heraclides, *Alleg. Hom.*, c. 22, where water evaporating is said to
become air, and settling, to become mud.

<span id="P6723_2107996"></span> <sup>67</sup> There is some difficulty
as to the reading: the ms., first ed., and Ursinus give *numero
s-c-ire*, explained by Canterus as meaning "that numbers have
understanding," i.e., so as to be the cause of all. Gelenius, followed
by Canterus, reads *-os scit*-"does Pyth. know numbers," which is
absurdly out of place. Heraldus approved of a reading in the margin of
Ursinus (merely inserting *o* after *c*), "that numbers unite," which
seems very plausible. The text follows an emendation of Gronovius
adopted by Orelli, *-o ex-ire.*

<span id="P6724_2108715"></span> <sup>68</sup> So the ms., reading *ut*;
but Orelli, and all edd. before him, *aut*-"or do they."

<span id="P6725_2108883"></span> <sup>69</sup> i.e., that truth knowable
by man exists.

<span id="P6726_2109237"></span> <sup>70</sup> So the ms. reading
*nostra in-credulitate*, for which Ursinus, followed by Stewechius,
reads *nostra cum.* Heraldus conjectured *vestra*, i.e., "in your
readiness of belief," you are just as much exposed to such ridicule.

<span id="P6728_2110057"></span> <sup>71</sup> Heraldus has well
suggested that *plurimum* is a gloss arising out of its being met with
in the next clause.

<span id="P6729_2110300"></span> <sup>72</sup> So the ms. and edd.,
reading *Platoni*; but Ursinus suggested *Plotino*, which Heraldus
thinks most probably correct. There is, indeed, an evident suitableness
in introducing here the later rather than the earlier philosopher, which
has great weight in dialog with the next name, and should therefore,
perhaps, have some in this case also.

<span id="P6730_2110650"></span> <sup>73</sup> The ms. and both Roman
edd. give *Crotonio*, rejected by the others because no Crotonius is
known (it has been referred, however, to Pythagoras, on the ground of
his having taught in Croton). In the margin of Ursinus *Cronius* was
suggested, received by LB. and Orelli, who is mentioned by Eusebius
(*Hist. Eccl.*, vi. 19, 3) with Numenius and others as an eminent
Pythagorean, and by Porphyry (*de Ant. Nymph.*, xxi. ), as a friend ot
Numenius, and one of those who treated the Homeric poems as allegories.
Gelenius substitutes Plotinus, followed by most edd.

<span id="P6731_2111275"></span> <sup>74</sup> \[Thus everywhere he
writes as a Christian.\]

<span id="P6732_2111372"></span> <sup>75</sup> *Stemus*, the admirable
correction of Gelenius for the ms. *tem-p-us.*

<span id="P6733_2111571"></span> <sup>76</sup> Orelli, following
Stewechius, would omit *ita*.

<span id="P6734_2112483"></span> <sup>77</sup> Hildebrand thinks
*compescere* here a gloss, but it must be remembered that redundancy is
a characteristic of Arnobius.

<span id="P6735_2112835"></span> <sup>78</sup> The superlative is here,
as elsewhere, used by Arnobius instead of the comparative.

<span id="P6736_2113363"></span> <sup>79</sup> i.e., so as to show the
relations existing between them.

<span id="P6737_2113614"></span> <sup>80</sup> Perhaps "axioms and
postulates."

<span id="P6738_2114081"></span> <sup>81</sup> According to Crusius,
*non* is not found in the ms..

<span id="P6739_2114197"></span> <sup>82</sup> White and Riddle
translate *candidule*, "sincerely," but give no other instance of its
use, and here the reference is plainly to the previous statement of the
literary excellence of the philosophers. Heraldus suggests *callidule*,
"cunningly," of which Orelli approves; but by referring the adv. to this
well-known meaning of its primitive, all necessity for emendation is
obviated.

<span id="P6741_2114724"></span> <sup>83</sup> Lit., "subtleties of
suspicions." This passage is certainly doubtful. The reading translated,
*et suspicionum argutias profertis*, is that of LB., Orelli, and the
later edd. generally; while the ms. reads *-atis*-"Bring forward
arguments to us, and" (for which Heraldus conjectures very plausibly,
*nec*, "and not") "subtleties," etc., which, by changing a single
letter, reads in the earlier edd. *pro-fer-etis*-"Will you," or, "You
will bring forward," etc.

<span id="P6742_2115356"></span> <sup>84</sup> Meursius conjectures
*in-* (for ms. *ju-*) *dicare*-"pointed out," of which Orelli approves.

<span id="P6743_2115506"></span> <sup>85</sup> So the ms. and both Roman
edd., supported by Heraldus, reading *solidae facilitatis*, changed by
the edd. into *stolidae*-"stupid."

<span id="P6744_2115869"></span> <sup>86</sup> So all the edd. except
Oehler; but as the first verb is plural in the ms., while the second is
singular, it is at least as probable that the second was plural
originally also, and that therefore the relative should be made to refer
both to "virtues" and "power."

<span id="P6745_2116422"></span> <sup>87</sup> Orelli notes that by
India is here meant Ethiopia. If so, it may be well to remember that
Lucan (x. 29 sq.) makes the Seres neighbours of the Ethiopians, and
dwellers at the sources of the Nile.

<span id="P6746_2116920"></span> <sup>88</sup> Instead of *sint*,
Stewechius would read *essent*-"were."

<span id="P6747_2117024"></span> <sup>89</sup> Instead of the ms.
reading, *Numae regis artibus et antiquis superstitionibus*, Stewechius,
followed by Heraldus, would read *ritibus*-"with the rites of Numa,"
etc.

<span id="P6748_2117317"></span> <sup>90</sup> So the ms., reading *res
patrias*, for which Heraldus, *ritus patrios*-"rites."

<span id="P6749_2117470"></span> <sup>91</sup> So the ms., although the
first five edd., by changing *r* into *s*, read *cur-s-um*-"course."
This story is of frequent occurrence in the later Fathers, but is never
referred to by the earlier, or by any except Christian writers, and is
derived solely from the Apostolic Constitutions. In the Greek version of
the Apost. Const. the sixth book opens with a dissertation on schisms
and heresies in which the story of Simon and others is told; but that
this was interpolated by some compiler seems clear from the arguments
brought forward by Bunsen (*Hippolytus and his Age*, more particularly
vol. ii. pt. 2, ยง 2, and the second appendix).

<span id="P6750_2118425"></span> <sup>92</sup> Brunda or Brenda, i.e.,
Brundisium.

<span id="P6752_2119787"></span> <sup>93</sup> Hermes Trismegistus. See
index.

<span id="P6753_2119975"></span> <sup>94</sup> So the ms. Elmenh., LB.,
Hildebrand, and Oehler, reading *quod*, for which the other edd. read
*qui*-"who."

<span id="P6754_2120124"></span> <sup>95</sup> This seems to be the
reading intended by the ms., which according to Hild. gives *dom*, i.e.,
probably *dominum*, which Oehler adopts, but all other edd. read
*deum*-"god."

<span id="P6755_2120580"></span> <sup>96</sup> Arnobius rather
exaggerates the force of the passage referred to (st. p. 173), which
occurs in the beautiful digression on philosophers. Plato there says
that only the philosopher's body is here on earth, while his mind,
holding politics and the ordinary business and amusements of life
unworthy of attention, is occupied with what is above and beneath the
earth, just as Thales, when he fell into a ditch, was looking at the
stars, and not at his steps.

<span id="P6756_2121381"></span> <sup>97</sup> *In cardinem vergere qui
orientis est solis* seems to be the reading of all edd.; but according
to Crusius the ms. reads *vertere*-"to turn." Hildebrand, on the
contrary, affirms that instead of *t*, the ms. gives *c*.

<span id="P6757_2121721"></span> <sup>98</sup> i.e., originally earlier.

<span id="P6758_2121808"></span> <sup>99</sup> So most edd., reading
*desituros*, for which Stewechius suggests *desulturos*-"leap down;" LB.
*exituros*-"go out."

<span id="P6759_2122015"></span> <sup>100</sup> Reference is here made
to one of the most extraordinary of the Platonic myths (*Pol.*,
269-274), in which the world is represented as not merely material, but
as being further possessed of intelligence. It is ever in motion, but
not always in the same way. For at one time its motion is directed by a
divine governor (tou\\ panto\\j o9 me\\n kubernh/thj); but this does not
continue, for he withdraws from his task, and thereupon the world loses,
or rather gives up its previous bias, and begins to revolve in the
opposite direction, causing among other results a reverse development of
the phenomena which occurred before, such as Arnobius describes.
Arnobius, however, gives too much weight to the myth, as in the
introduction it is more than hinted that it may be addressed to the
young Socrates, as boys like such stories, and he is not much more than
a boy. With it should be contrasted the "great year" of the Stoics, in
which the universe fulfilled its course, and then began afresh to pass
through the same experience as before (Nemesius, *de Nat. Hom.*, c. 38).

<span id="P6760_2123303"></span> <sup>101</sup> LB. makes these words
interrogative, but the above arrangement is clearly vindicated by the
tenor of the argument: You laugh at our care for our souls' salvation;
and truly you do not see to their safety by such precautions as a
virtuous life, but do you not seek that which you think salvation by
mystic rites?

<span id="P6761_2123776"></span> <sup>102</sup> Lit., "fastened with
beam" (i.e., large and strong) "nails."

<span id="P6762_2123875"></span> <sup>103</sup> Cf. on the intercessory
prayers of the Magi, c. 62, *infra*.

<span id="P6764_2124149"></span> <sup>104</sup> Pl. Cf. Milman's note on
Gibbon, vol. 2, c. xi. p. 7.

<span id="P6765_2124220"></span> <sup>105</sup> Lit., "certain fires."

<span id="P6766_2124472"></span> <sup>106</sup> Plato, in the passage
referred to (*Phaedo*, st. p. 113, ยง 61), speaks of the Styx not as a
river, but as the lake into which the Cocytus falls. The fourth river
which he mentions in addition to the Acheron, Pyriphlegethon, and
Cocytus, which he calls Stygian, is the Ocean stream.

<span id="P6767_2124900"></span> <sup>107</sup> So the ms., according to
Hild., reading *parvae*; but acc. to Rigaltius and Crusius, it gives
*pravae*-"of no mean."

<span id="P6768_2125263"></span> <sup>108</sup> So LB., Hild., and
Oehler, reading *doloris afficiat sensu*, by merely dropping *m* from
the ms. *sensu-m*; while all the other edd. read *doloribus
sensuum*-"affects with the pains of the senses."

<span id="P6769_2125532"></span> <sup>109</sup> i.e., not compounded of
soul and body.

<span id="P6770_2125858"></span> <sup>110</sup> Or, "not unsuitably,"
*absone.*

<span id="P6771_2126069"></span> <sup>111</sup> Lit., "in the failure
(or \`disappointment0') of," etc.

<span id="P6772_2126187"></span> <sup>112</sup> i.e., neither immortal
nor necessarily mortal.

<span id="P6773_2126456"></span> <sup>113</sup> So Gelenius emended the
unintelligible ms. reading *se-mina* by merely adding *s*, followed by
all edd., although Ursinus in the margin suggests *se mรฎam*, i.e.,
*mi-sericordiam*-"pity;" and Heraldus conjectures *munia*-"gifts."

<span id="P6774_2126726"></span> <sup>114</sup> So almost all edd., from
a conjecture of Gelenius, supplying *ut*, which is wanting in the ms..,
first ed., and Oehler.

<span id="P6775_2127034"></span> <sup>115</sup> It is worth while to
contrast Augustine's words: "The death which men fear is the separation
of the soul from the body. The true death, which men do not fear, is the
separation of the soul from God" (Aug. in Ps. xlviii., quoted by
Elmenhorst).

<span id="P6776_2127355"></span> <sup>116</sup> In the first ed.,
Gelenius, Canterus, Ursinus, and Orelli, both verbs are made present,
but all other edd. follow the ms. as above.

<span id="P6777_2127598"></span> <sup>117</sup> In the first ed.,
Gelenius, Canterus, Ursinus, and Orelli, both verbs are made present,
but all other edd. follow the ms. as above.

<span id="P6778_2127765"></span> <sup>118</sup> Lit., "and unknown."
Here Arnobius shows himself ignorant of Jewish teaching, as in iii. 12.

<span id="P6780_2127963"></span> <sup>119</sup> So the ms. and LB.,
followed by Oehler; in the edd. *id* is omitted.

<span id="P6781_2128137"></span> <sup>120</sup> The ms. reading is *a
no-b-is quibusdam*, for which LB. reads *nobis a qu.*-"to us," and Hild.
*a notis*- "by certain known;" but all others, as above, from a
conjecture of Gelenius, *a no-v-is*, although Orelli shows his critical
sagacity by preferring an emendation in the margin of Ursinus, *a
bonis*-"by certain good men," in which he sees a happy irony!

<span id="P6782_2128738"></span> <sup>121</sup> Lit., "not touchable by
any contact of body," *neque ulla corporis attrectatione contiguas.*

<span id="P6783_2129428"></span> <sup>122</sup> Arnobius considers the
*reductio ad absurdum* so very plain that he does not trouble himself to
state his argument more directly.

<span id="P6785_2129642"></span> <sup>123</sup> There has been much
confusion as to the meaning of Arnobius throughout this discussion,
which would have been obviated if it had been remembered that his main
purpose in it is to show how unsatisfactory and unstable are the
theories of the philosophers, and that he is not therefore to be
identified with the views brought forward, but rather with the
objections raised to them.

<span id="P6786_2130071"></span> <sup>124</sup> Cf. c. 28, p. 440, note
2.

<span id="P6787_2130512"></span> <sup>125</sup> So the ms., followed by
Orelli and others reading *institutum superciliumque*-"habit and
arrogance," for the first word of which LB. reads *istum typhum*-"that
pride of yours;" Meursius, *isti typhum*-"Lay aside pride, O ye."

<span id="P6788_2131758"></span> <sup>126</sup> So the edd., reading *in
totidem sexus* for the ms. *sexu*-"into so many kinds in sex."

<span id="P6789_2132413"></span> <sup>127</sup> Lit., "in so great
occupations of life."

<span id="P6790_2132955"></span> <sup>128</sup> Cf. Plato, *Phaedo*, st.
p. 81.

<span id="P6792_2134342"></span> <sup>129</sup> So, by a later writer in
the margin of the ms., who gives *artificiosa-s novitates*, adopted by
Stewechius and Oehler, the *s* being omitted in the text of the ms.
itself, as in the edd., which drop the final *s* in the next word
also-"would raise and with unknown art strike out lofty buildings."

<span id="P6794_2135276"></span> <sup>130</sup> Lit., "born."

<span id="P6795_2135375"></span> <sup>131</sup> Throughout this
discussion, Arnobius generally uses the plural, *animae*-"souls."

<span id="P6796_2135948"></span> <sup>132</sup> So Elmenhorst, Oberthรผr,
and Orelli, reading *par-a-v-it sibi et* for the ms. *parv-as et*, "from
continual failure has wrought out indeed slight smattering of the arts,"
etc., which is retained in both Roman edd., LB., and Hild.; while
Gelenius and Canterus merely substitute *sibi* for *et*, "wrought out
for itself slight," etc.

<span id="P6798_2136475"></span> <sup>133</sup> Lit., "or received
understanding of God by the breath of any suspicion."

<span id="P6799_2136737"></span> <sup>134</sup> The ms. gives
*c-etera-que*, "'and the rest," which is retained in both Roman edd.,
and by Gelenius and Canterus, though rather out of place, as the
enumeration goes on.
