name there was current in the time of Arnobius an immense mass of
literature freely used, and it is probable sometimes supplemented, by
Christian writers. Cf. c. 19.

<span id="P7901_2495168"></span> <sup>168</sup> Lit, "put forth with
Greek mouth."

<span id="P7905_2495428"></span> <sup>169</sup> Lit., "tossing."

<span id="P7912_2495753"></span> <sup>170</sup> It may be well to
observe that Arnobius differs from the Greek versions of these lines
found in Clem. Alex. (vol. ii. p. 177) and Eusebius (*Praepar. Evang.*
ii. 3), omitting all mention of Iacchus, who is made very prominent by
them; and that he does not adhere strictly to metrical rules, probably,
as Heraldus pointed out, because, like the poets of that age, he paid
little heed to questions of quantity. Whether Arnobius has merely
paraphrased the original as found in Clement and Eusebius, or had a
different version of them before him, is a question which can only be
discussed by means of a careful comparison between the Greek and Latin
forms of the verses with the context in both cases.

<span id="P7913_2496497"></span> <sup>171</sup> So LB., Hild., and
Oehler, reading *Erechthidoe O* (inserted by Hild.) for the ms.
*erithideo.*

<span id="P7914_2496627"></span> <sup>172</sup> i.e. Athenians.

<span id="P7915_2496842"></span> <sup>173</sup> The ms., 1st ed., Hild.,
and Oehler read *ita*-"It is thus not," etc.; the others as above,
*ista.*

<span id="P7916_2497012"></span> <sup>174</sup> *Delatione calumniosa*.
\[Conf. vol. ii. p. 175, col. 2.\]

<span id="P7917_2497317"></span> <sup>175</sup> *Cyceon*. (P. 499,
*supra*, and 503, *infra*.\]

<span id="P7918_2497402"></span> <sup>176</sup> The ms. reads *exci-ta*,
corrected as above, *ex cista*, in the margins of Ursinus.

<span id="P7919_2497582"></span> <sup>177</sup> \[It is a pity that all
this must be retailed anew after Clement, vol. ii. pp. 175, 177,

<span id="P7921_2497868"></span> <sup>178</sup> Lit., "by stealthy

<span id="P7922_2497941"></span> <sup>179</sup> Lit. "is the honour of

honoribus praefatis..*

<span id="P7924_2498955"></span> <sup>181</sup> So Stewechius, LB., and
Orelli, reading *spec-t-u in t-ali* for the ms. *in specu ali.*

<span id="P7925_2499229"></span> <sup>182</sup> Lit., "light." \[Note
Clement, vol. ii. p. 175, col. 2, line 12.\]

<span id="P7926_2499562"></span> <sup>183</sup> So the ms., Hild. and
Oehler reading *noscentis.*

<span id="P7928_2499760"></span> <sup>184</sup> This allusion is
somewhat obscure. Heraldus regards *tricas Tellenas* as akin in sense to
*t. Atellanas*, i.e., "comic trifles;" in which case the sense would be,
that Arnobius had been heaping up any trifles which would keep him back
from the disagreeable subject. Ausonius Popma (quoted by Orelli)
explains the phrase with reference to the capture of Tellenae by Ancus
Martius as meaning "something hard to get through."

<span id="P7929_2500233"></span> <sup>185</sup> The ms. reads
*alimoniae*, corrected from Clem. Alex. by Salmasius, *Alimontia*, i.e.
celebrated at Halimus in Attica.

<span id="P7930_2500693"></span> <sup>186</sup> Lit., "in pure senses."
\[Ironically said.\]

<span id="P7931_2500770"></span> <sup>187</sup> Cicero (*de Nat. Deor.*,
iii. 23) speaks of five Dionysi, the father of the fifth being Nisus.
Arnobius had this passage before him in writing the fourth book (cf. c.
15, and n. 2), so that he may here mean to speak of Liber similarly.

<span id="P7932_2501588"></span> <sup>188</sup> Lit., "that he will be."

<span id="P7933_2501750"></span> <sup>189</sup> So the ms., acc. to
Hild., reading *expe-titionis*; acc. to Crusius, the ms. gives
*-ditionis*-"(having accomplished) his expedition."

<span id="P7934_2502026"></span> <sup>190</sup> Lit., "is surveying with
all careful examination."

<span id="P7935_2502262"></span> <sup>191</sup> ms. *cuius*. \[Retailed
from Clement, vol. ii. p. 180. As to the arguments the Fathers were
compelled to use with heathen, see note 5, same volume, p. 206.\]

<span id="P7937_2503170"></span> <sup>192</sup> i.e., the sceptic.

<span id="P7941_2505536"></span> <sup>196</sup> Lit., "of holy
divinity." Orelli thinks, and with reason, that Arnobius refers to the
words which Terence puts into the mouth of Chaerea (*Eun.*, iii. 5, vv.
36-43), who encourages himself to give way to lust by asking, "Shall I,
a man, not do this?" when Jove had done as much. \[Elucidation III.\]

<span id="P7943_2505998"></span> <sup>197</sup> Lit., "to speak of any
one as atheist...of those who," etc.

<span id="P7944_2506459"></span> <sup>198</sup> So the ms. and edd.,
reading *in eo*, for which we should perhaps read *in eos*-"heap upon
them."

<span id="P7945_2507027"></span> <sup>199</sup> *Subsicivis laudibus.*

<span id="P7946_2507133"></span> <sup>200</sup> Lit., "to the reward
(*meritum*) of divinity."

<span id="P7948_2507414"></span> <sup>201</sup> Lit., "unwounded."

<span id="P7949_2507588"></span> <sup>202</sup> So the edd., reading
*tardati* for the ms. *tradatis*, except Hild., who reads *tardatis.*

<span id="P7950_2508147"></span> <sup>203</sup> i.e., the gods.

<span id="P7951_2508197"></span> <sup>204</sup> *Exoletos*. Cf. iv. c.

<span id="P7954_2509360"></span> <sup>206</sup> Both Roman edd. and ms.
read *dicet*-"shall say;" all others as above-*dicit*.

<span id="P7955_2509630"></span> <sup>207</sup> i.e., Jupiter.

<span id="P7956_2509790"></span> <sup>208</sup> Lit., "in the

<span id="P7957_2509956"></span> <sup>209</sup> So the margin of
Ursinus-*ut reris* for the ms. *ut ce-reris.*

<span id="P7959_2510632"></span> <sup>210</sup> Lit., "colours of."

<span id="P7960_2510891"></span> <sup>211</sup> The ms. and both Roman
edd. read *indecorum est*, which leaves the sentence incomplete. LB.,
followed by later edd., proposed *de-cursum est*, as above (Oehler,
*inde d.*-"from these recourse has been had"), the other conjectures
tending to the same meaning.

<span id="P7961_2511501"></span> <sup>212</sup> "We need only;" lit.,
"it is enough for us to."

<span id="P7962_2511595"></span> <sup>213</sup> Lit., "heard."

<span id="P7974_2514451"></span> <sup>223</sup> The ms., first four
edd., and Hild. read *de his*-"about these," corrected in the others
*dîs* or *diis*, as above.

<span id="P7978_2515344"></span> <sup>227</sup> i.e., Proserpine. The
readiness with which Arnobius breaks the form of the sentence should be
noted. At first the gods represent physical phenomena, but immediately
after natural events are put for the gods. In the ms. two copyists have
been at work, the earlier giving *Libero*, which is rather out of place,
and is accordingly corrected by the later, *Libera* followed by LB.,
Oberthür, Orelli, Hild., and Oehler.

<span id="P7979_2515945"></span> <sup>228</sup> The ms. reads *primo*.

obscurities."

<span id="P7991_2519058"></span> <sup>239</sup> The reference is to the
words in the middle of the chapter, "how do you know which part is
simple?" etc.; Arnobius now saying that he does not see how this can be
known.
