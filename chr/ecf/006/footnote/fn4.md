our English version of this twelfth chapter of *Koheleth* is heightened
not a little by comparison with this turgid metaphrase, It fails, in

this superlatively poetic and didactic threnode. It must have been a

archbishop of Neo-Caesareia, surnamed Thaumaturgus, concerning those
who, in the inroad of the barbarians, ate things sacrificed to idols, or
offended in certain other matters. Gallandi, iii. p. 400. \[Written A.D.
258 or 262.\] There are scholia in Latin by Theodorus Balsamon and
Joannes Zonaras on these canons. The note of the former on the last
canon may be cited:-The present saint has defined shortly five several
positions for the penitent; but he has not indicated either the times
appointed for their exercise, or the sins for which discipline is
determined. Basil the Great, again, has handed down to us an accurate
account of these things in his canonical epistles. \[Elucidation II.\]
Yet he, too, has referred to episcopal decision the matter of recovery
through penalties \[i.e., to the decision of his comprovincial bishops,
as in Cyprian's example. See vol. v. p. 415, Elucidation XIII.; also
Elucidation I. p. 20, *infra*
