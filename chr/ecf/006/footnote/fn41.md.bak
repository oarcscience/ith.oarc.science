A beautiful exordium. A recent writer, speaking of Potamiaena and
Herais, virgin martyrs, and catechumens of Origen, remarks, that "the
number of young women of high character who appreciated the teachings of
this great master, *many of whom were employed as copyists of his
works*, is creditable to the state of Christian society at that period "
(Mahan, *Church Hist.*, p. 237). It was to avoid scandal as well as
temptation in his relations with these that he fell into his heroic
mistake.
