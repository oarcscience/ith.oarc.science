<span id="P4640_1381986"></span> <sup>3</sup> For liberal references,
consult Hagenbach, *Text-Book of the History of Doctrine*; by all means
using Professor Smith's edition, New York, 1861.

<span id="P4642_1382532"></span> <sup>4</sup> For the matters touching
the theology of the period, the student should prepare himself by
consulting Waterland, *History of the Athanasian Creed* (*Works*, vol.
iv., London), and Van Oosterzee, *Christian Dogmatics*, New York, 1874.
I wonder that Professor Smith could, so unreservedly, commend Hagenbach.

<span id="P4662_1387699"></span> <sup>3</sup> Colluthus, being a
presbyter of Alexandria, puffed up with arrogance and temerity, had
acted as a bishop, and had ordained many priests and deacons. But in the
synod that was assembled at Alexandria all his acts of ordination were
rescinded; and those who had been ordained by him degraded to the rank
of laymen.-Tr.

Alexandria in which Arius and his companion were condemned. But
Alexander convened two synods of the bishops of Egypt against Arius and
his friends.-Tr.
