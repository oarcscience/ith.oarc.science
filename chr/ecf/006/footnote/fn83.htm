<SUP>20 </SUP>Or perhaps, simply, "the sacrifice is a living one," <I>animalis est hostia</I>. Macrobius, however (<I>Sat.</I>, iii. 5), quotes Trebatius as saying that there were two kinds of sacrifices, in one of which the entrails were examined that they might disclose the divine will, while in the other the life only was consecrated to the deity. This is more precisely stated by Servius (<I>Aen.</I>, iii. 231), who says that the <I>hostia animalis</I> was only slain, that in other cases the blood was poured on the altars, that in others part of the victim, and in others the whole animal, was burned. It is probable, therefore that Arnobius uses the words here in their technical meaning, as the next clause shows that none of the flesh was offered, while the blood was allowed to fall to the ground. [I am convinced that classical antiquities must be more largely studied in the Fathers of the first five centuries.]</P>

<SUP>37 </SUP>It is perhaps possible so to translate the ms. <I>neque si sunt ulli apertissima potuit cognitione dignosci</I>, retained by Orelli, Hild., and Oehler, in which case <I>si sunt ui?li</I> must be taken as the subject of the clause.

<SUP>81 </SUP>To this the commentators have replied, that mules, asses, and dogs were sacrificed to certain deities.
