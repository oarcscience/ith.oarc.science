Christophorsonus would read strathgou= in the sense of *commander.* But
the word is used here of the *duumviri*, or magistrates of Alexandria.
And that the word strathgo/j was used in this *civil* acceptation as
well as in the common *military* application, we see by many examples in
Athanasius, Ammianus Marcellinus, and others. Thus, as Valesius remarks,
the *soldiers* (stratiwtw=n) here will be the band with the centurion,
and the attendants (u/phretw=n) will be the civil followers of the
magistrates.

<span id="P1629_457621"></span> <sup>5</sup> This happened in the first
persecution under Decius, when Dionysius was carried off by the decision
of the prefect Sabinus to Taposiris, as he informs us in his epistle to
Germanus. Certainly any one who compares that epistle of Dionysius to
Germanus with this one to Domitius, will have no doubt that he speaks of
one and the same event in both. Hence Eusebius is in error in thinking
that in this epistle of Dionysius to Domitius we have a narrative of the
events relating to the persecution of Valerian,-a position which may
easily be refuted from Dionysius himself. For in the persecution under
Valerian, Dionysius was not carried off into exile under military
custody, nor were there any men from Mareotis, who came and drove off
the soldiers, and bore him away unwillingly, and set him at liberty
again; nor had Dionysius on that occasion the presbyters Gaius and
Faustus, and Peter and Paul, with him. All these things happened to
Dionysius in that persecution which began a little before Decius
obtained the empire, as he testifies himself in his epistle to Germanus.
But in the persecution under Valerian, Dionysius was accompanied in
exile by the presbyter Maximus, and the deacons Faustus, and Eusebius,
and Chaeremon, and a certain Roman cleric, as he tells us in the epistle
to Germanus.-Valesius.

<span id="P1631_459500"></span> <sup>6</sup> e0n th=\| no/sw\|, Rufinus
reads nh/sw\|, and renders it, "But of the deacons, some died in the
island after the pains of confession." But Dionysius refers to the
pestilence which traversed the whole Roman world in the times of Gallus
and Volusianus, as Eusebius in his *Chronicon* and others record. See
Aurelius Victor. Dionysius makes mention of this sickness again in the
paschal epistle to the Alexandrians, where he also speaks of the deacons
who were cut off by that plague.-Vales.

Christophorsonus renders it: "to prepare the linen cloths in which the
bodies of the blessed martyrs who departed this life might be wrapped."
In this Valesius thinks he errs by looking at the modern method of
burial, whereas among the ancient Christians the custom was somewhat
different, the bodies being dressed out in full attire, and that often
at great cost, as Eusebius shows us in the case of Astyrius, in the
*Hist. Eccles.*, vii. 16. Yet Athanasius, in his *Life of Antonius*, has
this sentence: "The Egyptians are accustomed to attend piously to the
funerals of the bodies of the dead, and especially those of the holy
martyrs, and to wrap then in linen cloths: they are not wont, however,
to consign them to the earth, but to place them on couches, and keep
them in private apartments."

<span id="P1637_461706"></span> <sup>9</sup> Jerome, in his *Catalogus*,
where he adduces the beginning of this epistle, gives Novatianus for
Novatus. So in the *Chronicon* of Georgius Syncellus we have Dionu/sioj
Nauatianw=\|. Rufinus' account appears to be that there were two such
epistles,-one to Novatus, and another to Novatianus. The confounding of
these two forms seems, however, to have been frequent among the Greeks.
\[See Lardner, *Credib., sub voce Novat.* Wordsworth thinks the Greeks
shortened the name, on the grounds which Horace notes *ad vocem*
"Equotuicum." *Satires*, I. v. 87.\]

Sophronius on Jerome's *De vir. illustr.*, ch. 69, and Georgius

<span id="P1641_463922"></span> <sup>11</sup> Eusebius, *Hist. Eccles.*,

the following account of the conflicts of those who suffered martyrdom
at Alexandria."

the proconsul addresses the martyr with the order: loido/rhson to\\n

<span id="P1656_469119"></span> <sup>22</sup> This refers to the death
of the Emperor Philip, who showed a very righteous and kindly
disposition toward the Christians. Accordingly the matters here
recounted by Dionysius took place in the last year of the Emperor
Philip. This is also indicated by Dionysius in the beginning of this
epistle, where he says that the persecution began at Alexandria a whole
year before the edict of the Emperor Decius. But Christophorsonus, not
observing this, interprets the metabolh\\n th=j basilei/aj as signifying
a change in *the emperor's mind* toward the Christians, in which error
he is followed by Baronius, ch. 102.-Vales.

as h9 para\\ braxu/. But the reading in the text, a0pofai=non "setting

seems the best, the idea being that this edict of Decius was so terrible
as in a certain measure to represent the most fearful of all times,
viz., those of Antichrist.-Vales.

"alii ex privatis aedibus in publicum raptati ad delubra ducuntur a

pra/ttontej, i.e., decurions and magistrates. For when the edict of
Decius was conveyed to them, commanding all to sacrifice to the immortal
gods, these officials had to convene themselves in the court-house as
usual, and stand and listen while the decree was there publicly recited.
Thus they were in a position officially which led them to be the first
to sacrifice. The word praceij occurs often in the sense of the acts and
administration of magistrates: thus, in Eusebius, viii. 11; in
Aristides, in the funeral oration on Alexander, ta\\ d' ei0j praceij te
kai\\ politeiaj, etc. There are similar passage also in Plutarch's
Politika\\ paragge/lmata, and in Severianus's sixth oration on the
Hexameron. So Chrysostom, in his eighty-third homily on Matthew, calls
the decurions tou\\j ta\\ politika\\ pra/ttontaj. The word
dhmosieu/ontej, however, may also be explained of those employed in the
departments of law or finance; so that the clause might be rendered,
with Valesius: "alii, qui in publico versabantur, rebus ipsis et
reliquorum exemplo, ad sacrificandum ducebantur." See the note in Migne.

<span id="P1670_476598"></span> <sup>33</sup> In his *Bibliotheca*, cod.

Rufinus and Christophorsonus make n *turmam militum.* Valesius prefers
*manipulum* or *contubernium*. These may have been the apparitors or
officers of the *praefectus Augustalis*. Valesius thinks rather that
they were legionaries, from the legion which had to guard the city of
Alexandria, and which was under the authority of the *praefectus
Augustalis*. For at that time the *praefectus Augustalis* had charge of
military affairs as well as civil.

<span id="P1678_482011"></span> <sup>39</sup> This passage is notable
from the fact that it makes mention of the Saracens. For of the writers
whose works have come down to us there is none more ancient than
Dionysius of Alexandria that has named the Saracens. Ammianus
Marcellinus, however, writes in his fourteenth book that he has made
mention of the Saracens in the Acts of Marcus. Spartianus also mentions
the Saracens in his *Niger*, and says that the Roman soldiers were
beaten by them.-Vales. \["The barbarous Saracens:" what a *nominis
umbra* projected by "coming events," in this blissfully ignorant
reference of our author! Compare Robertson, *Researches*, on the
conquest of Jerusalem.\]

<span id="P1680_483172"></span> <sup>40</sup> As to the martyrs'
immediate departure to the Lord, and their abode with Him, see
Tertullian, *On the Resurrection of the Flesh*, ch. xliii., and *On the

<span id="P1681_483446"></span> <sup>41</sup> That the martyrs were to
be Christ's assessors, judging the world with Him, was a common opinion
among the fathers. So, after Dionysius, Eulogius, bishop of Alexandria,
in his fifth book, *Against the Novatians*. Photius, in his
*Bibliotheca*, following Chrysostom, objects to this, and explains
Paul's words in 1 Cor. vi. 2 as having the same intention as Christ's
words touching the men of Nineveh and the queen of the south who should
rise up in the judgment and condemn that generation.

<span id="P1688_485668"></span> <sup>47</sup> Eusebius introduces this
in words to the following effect: "Writing to this same Fabius, who
seemed to incline somewhat to this schism, Dionysius of Alexandria,
after setting forth in his letter many other matters which bore on
repentance, and after describing the conflicts of the martyrs who had
recently suffered in Alexandria, relates among other things one
specially wonderful fact, which I have deemed proper for insertion in
this history, and which is as follows."

<span id="P1689_486367"></span> <sup>48</sup> That is, none either of
the clergy or of the people were moved by his prayers to consider him a
proper subject for absolution; for the people's suffrages were also
necessary for the reception into the Church of any who had lapsed, and
been on that account cut off from it. And sometimes the bishop himself
asked the people to allow absolution to be given to the suppliant, as we
see in Cyprian's Epistle 53, to Cornelius \[vol. v. p. 336, this
series\], and in Tertullian *On Modesty*, ch. xiii. \[vol. iv. p. 86,
this series\]. Oftener, however, the people themselves made intercession
with the bishop for the admission of penitents; of which we have a
notable instance in the Epistle of Cornelius to Fabius of Antioch about
that bishop who had ordained Novatianus. See also Cyprian, Epistle 59
\[vol. v. p. 355\].-Vales.

<span id="P1690_487701"></span> <sup>49</sup> In the African Synod,
which met about the time that Dionysus wrote, it was decreed that
absolution should be granted to lapsed persons who were near their end,
provided that they had sought it earnestly before their illness. See
Cyprian in the Epistle to Antonianus \[vol. v. p. 327, this
series\].-Vales.

<span id="P1692_488481"></span> <sup>51</sup> Valesius thinks that this
custom prevailed for a long time, and cites a synodical letter of
Ratherius, bishop of Verona (which has also been ascribed to Udalricus
by Gretserus, who has published it along with his *Life of Gregory
VII.*), in which the practice is expressly forbidden in these terms:
"And let no one presume to give the communion to a laic or a woman for
the purpose of conveying it to an infirm person."

<span id="P1693_488937"></span> <sup>52</sup> a0pobre/cai. Rufinus

*by Christ.* For Dionysius alludes to those words of Christ in the
Gospel: "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess also
before my Father."-Vales.
