<SUP>121 </SUP>It is worth while to compare this passage with ch. 16. Here Arnobius makes I.atona the mother of Apollo and Diana in accordance with the common legend; but there he represents the first Minerva as claming them as her children.</P>

<P><A NAME="P7609_2395296"></A>
<SUP>122 </SUP>In the ms. there is here an evident blunder on the part of the copyist, who has inserted the preceding line ("the archer Apollo, and of the woods") after "the same." Omitting these words, the ms. reading is literally, "the name in Greek is to the Dioscori." Before "the name" some word is pretty generally supposed to have been lost, some conjecturing "to whom;" others (among them Orelli, following Salmasius) "Castores." But it is evidently not really necessary to supplement the text.</P>

<P><A NAME="P7618_2399851"></A>
<SUP>129 </SUP>The ms. reads <I>et ablui diebus tantis...elevari</I>; LB., Hild. and Oehler, <I>statis</I> or <I>statutis...et levari</I>-"and was loosed and released on fixed days:" Elm., Oberth&uuml;r, and Orelli receive the conjecture of Ursinus, <I>et suis diebus tantum...rel.</I>, as above.</P>

<SUP>134 </SUP>The ms. and most edd. give <I>filias</I>, making the Muses daughters of Macarus; but Orelli, Hild., and Oehler adopt, as above, the reading of Canterus, <I>filiae</I>, in accordance with Clem. Alex.</P>

<P><A NAME="P7625_2401572"></A>
<SUP>135 </SUP>So the ms. reading <I>numquid dictatum</I>, which would refer this sentence to the end of the last chapter. Gelenius, with Canth., Oberth., and Orelli, reads <I>quis ditatam</I>, and joins with the following sentence thus: "Who related that Venus, a courtezan enriched by C., was deified...? who that the palladium," etc. Cf. v. 19.</P>

<P><A NAME="P7626_2402344"></A>
<SUP>136 </SUP>The ms. reads <I>quis mensibus in Arcadia tribus et decem vinctum</I>-"Who that he was bound thirteen months in Arcadia? was it not the son," etc. To which there are these two objections-that Homer never says so; and that Clemens Alexandrinus [vol. ii. p, 179, this series], from whom Arnobius here seems to draw, speaks of Homer as saying only that Mars was so bound, without referring to Arcadia. The ms. reading may have arisen from carelessness on the part of Arnobius in quoting (cf. ch. 14, n. 2), or may be a corruption of the copyists. The reading translated is an emendation by Jortin, adopted by Orelli.</P>

<SUP>161 </SUP><I>Patrimus</I>, i.e., one whose father is alive, is probably used loosely for <I>patrimus et matrimus</I>, to denote one both of whose parents were alive, who was therefore eligible for certain religious services.</P>

<SUP>162 </SUP>So the ms. reading <I>terram tenere</I>, for which Hild. would read <I>tensam</I>, denoting the car on which were borne the images of the gods, the thongs or reins of which were held by the <I>patrimus et matrimus</I>; Lipsius, <I>siserram</I>, the sacrificial victim. The reading of the text has been explained as meaning to touch the ground with one's hands; but the general meaning is clear enough,-that it was unlucky if the boy made a slip, either with hands or feet.</P>

<SUP>190 </SUP>The service in which these prayers were offered was presided over by the bishop, to whom the dead body was brought: hymns were then sung of thanksgiving to God, the giver of victory, by whose help and grace the departed brother had been victorious. The priest next gave thanks to God, and some chapters of the Scriptures were read; afterwards the catechumens were dismissed; the names of those at rest were then read in a clear voice, to remind the survivors of the success with which others had combated the temptations of the world. The priest again prayed for the departed, at the close beseeching God to grant him pardon, and admission among the undying. Thereafter the body was kissed, anointed, and buried.-Dionysius, <I>Eccl. Hier.</I>, last chapter quoted by Heraldus. Cf. <I>Const. Apost.</I>, viii. 41. With the Church's advance in power there was an accession of pomp to these rites. [Elucidation IV.]</P>
