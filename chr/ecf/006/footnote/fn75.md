<span id="P7500_2360897"></span> <sup>30</sup> No mention is made of
this deity by any other author.

<span id="P7501_2361354"></span> <sup>31</sup> Lit., "that he may do
what."

<span id="P7502_2361581"></span> <sup>32</sup> Lit., "*good* condition,"
*habitudinem.*

<span id="P7503_2362145"></span> <sup>33</sup> Lit., "a disreputable
act."

<span id="P7505_2362237"></span> <sup>34</sup> So the ms. reading
*flagitiis*, followed by all edd. except LB. and Orelli, who read
*plagiis*-"kidnapping."

<span id="P7506_2362414"></span> <sup>35</sup> Of this goddess, also, no
other author makes mention but the germ may be perhaps found in
Lucretius (ii. 1116-7), where nature is termed *perfica*, i.e.,
"perfecting," or making all things complete. \[The learned translator
forgets Tertullian, who introduces us to this name in the work Arnobius
imitates throughout. See vol. iii. p. 140.\]

<span id="P7507_2362932"></span> <sup>36</sup> i.e., *in cubiculis
praesto est virginalem scrobem effodientibus maritis.*

<span id="P7508_2363062"></span> <sup>37</sup> The first five edd. read
*Mutunus*. Cf. ch. 11. \[I think it a mistake to make Mutubus = Priapus.
Their horrible deformities are *diverse*, as I have noted in European
collections of antiquities. The *specialty* of Mutunus is noted by our
author, and is unspeakably abominable. All this illustrates, therefore,
the Christian scruples about marriage-feasts, of which see vol. v. note
1, p. 435.\]

<span id="P7509_2363807"></span> <sup>38</sup> Lit., the "fancies" or
"imaginations" of false gods. Meursius proposed to transpose the whole
of this sentence to the end of the chapter, which would give a more
strictly logical arrangement; but it must be remembered that Arnobius
allows himself much liberty in this respect.

<span id="P7510_2364171"></span> <sup>39</sup> Of these three deities no
other mention is made.

<span id="P7511_2364425"></span> <sup>40</sup> The ms., LB., Hild., and
Oehler read *qui*-"who brings;" the other edd., as above, *quia.*

<span id="P7512_2364630"></span> <sup>41</sup> So the ms. (cf. ch. 11),
first five edd., Oberth., Hild., and Oehler; the other edd., read
*Nodutim Ter.*

<span id="P7513_2364760"></span> <sup>42</sup> So the ms., both Roman
edd., and Oehler; the other edd. reading *Vibilia*, except Hild.,
*Viabilia.*

<span id="P7514_2365027"></span> <sup>43</sup> The ms. reads
*nam*-"for," followed by all edd. except Orelli, who reads *jam* as
above, and Oehler, who reads *etiam*-"also."

<span id="P7516_2365458"></span> <sup>44</sup> Orelli omits *non*,
following Oberthür.

<span id="P7517_2365623"></span> <sup>45</sup> Both in this and the
preceding chapter the ms. reads *Melonia.*

<span id="P7518_2366242"></span> <sup>46</sup> Lit., "obtained by lot
the wardships."

<span id="P7519_2366540"></span> <sup>47</sup> Lit., "signs."

<span id="P7521_2367320"></span> <sup>48</sup> So the ms. both Roman
edd., Hild., and Oehler; the others reading *Liburnum*, except Elm, who
reads *-am*, while Meursius conjectured *Liberum*-"Bacchus."

<span id="P7522_2367583"></span> <sup>49</sup> Lit., "shameful impurity
seeks after;" *expetit* read by Gelenius, Canterus, and Oberthür, for
the unintelligible ms. reading *expeditur*, retained in both Roman edd.;
the others reading *experitur*- "tries."

<span id="P7523_2368092"></span> <sup>50</sup> The ms. reads *Lemons*;
Hild. and Oehler, *Limones*; the others, *Limos*, as above.

<span id="P7524_2368303"></span> <sup>51</sup> The ms. LB., Hild., and
Oehler read *Murcidam*; the others, *Murciam*, as above.

<span id="P7525_2368544"></span> <sup>52</sup> i.e., equestrian rank.

<span id="P7527_2368942"></span> <sup>53</sup> The ms. reading is *quid
si haberet in sedibus suos*, retained by the first five edd., with the
change of *-ret* into *-rent*-"what if in their seats the bones had
their own peculiar guardians;" Ursinus in the margin, followed by Hild.
and Oehler, reads *in se divos suos*-"if for themselves the bones had
gods as their own peculiar," etc.; the other edd. reading, as above, *si
habere insistitis suos.*

<span id="P7529_2370240"></span> <sup>54</sup> i.e., deities. So LB. and
Orelli, reading *quid potestatum?*-"what, *O fathers* of powers." The
ms. gives *qui*-"what say you, O fathers of new religions, who cry out,
and complain that gods of powers are indecently dishonoured by us, and
neglected with impious contempt," etc. Heraldus emends thus: "...fathers
of great religions and powers? Do you, then, cry out," etc. "Fathers,"
i.e., those who discovered, and introduced, unknown deities and forms of
worship.

<span id="P7530_2370898"></span> <sup>55</sup> The ms. reads *pertus
quae-* (marked as spurious) *dam*; and, according to Hild., *naeniam* is
written over the latter word.

<span id="P7531_2371045"></span> <sup>56</sup> So the ms. Cf. ch. 7
\[note 10, p. 478, *supra*\].

<span id="P7532_2371266"></span> <sup>57</sup> The ms. is here very
corrupt and imperfect,-*supplices hoc est uno procumbimus atque est
utuno* (Orelli omits *ut-*), emended by Gelenius, with most edd., *supp.
Mut-uno proc. atque Tutuno*, as above; Elm. and LB. merely insert
*humi*-"on the ground," after *supp.* \[See p. 478, note 6, *supra*\]

<span id="P7533_2371911"></span> <sup>58</sup> Meursius is of opinion
that some words have slipped out of the text here, and that some
arguments had been introduced about augury and divination.

<span id="P7534_2372124"></span> <sup>59</sup> *Contendis*, not found in
the ms.

<span id="P7536_2372633"></span> <sup>60</sup> i.e., the predictions.

<span id="P7537_2372721"></span> <sup>61</sup> Lit., "will you make the
same belief."

<span id="P7538_2372889"></span> <sup>62</sup> Lit., "adapt themselves
to the significations of the things which."

<span id="P7539_2373338"></span> <sup>63</sup> Lit., "brothers of."

<span id="P7540_2373428"></span> <sup>64</sup> i.e., demons.

<span id="P7541_2373557"></span> <sup>65</sup> Perhaps
"abilities"-*materiis.*

<span id="P7542_2373678"></span> <sup>66</sup> The ms. reads *cum*-
"with similar reason we may believe," instead of *cur*, as above.

<span id="P7544_2374071"></span> <sup>67</sup> Lit., "novelty of the
thing."

<span id="P7545_2374250"></span> <sup>68</sup> Lit., "of places and
divisions," i.e., places separated from each other.

<span id="P7546_2374359"></span> <sup>69</sup> Lit., "affords to you the
appearance of."

<span id="P7548_2375103"></span> <sup>70</sup> Lit., "a severity of
stern manner"-*moris* for the ms. *mares.*

<span id="P7549_2375409"></span> <sup>71</sup> Orelli here introduces
the sentence, "For it cannot be," etc., with which this book is
concluded in the ms. Cf. ch. 37, n. 4, *infra*.

<span id="P7550_2375895"></span> <sup>72</sup> There can be no doubt
that Arnobius here refers to Clemens Alexandrinus (Lo/goj Protreptiko\\j
pro\\j 9Ellh=naj), and Cicero (*de Nat. Deor.*), from whom he borrows
most freely in the following chapters, quoting them at times very
closely. We shall not indicate particular references without some
special reason, as it must be understood these references would be
required with every statement. \[Compare Clement, vol. ii. pp. 305-13,
and Tertullian, vol. iii. p. 34.\]

<span id="P7551_2376406"></span> <sup>73</sup> Lit., "given to us an
abridging," i.e., an opportunity of abridging.

<span id="P7553_2376945"></span> <sup>74</sup> Lit., "committed to
sepulture and born in," etc.

<span id="P7554_2377247"></span> <sup>75</sup> Arnobius repeats this
statement in ch. 22, or the name would have been regarded as corrupt, no
other author making mention of such a goddess; while Cicero speaks of
one Sun as born of Hyperion. It would appear, therefore, to be very
probable that Arnobius, in writing from memory or otherwise, has been
here in some confusion as to what Cicero did say, and thus wrote the
name as we have it. It has also been proposed to read "born of Regina"
(or, with Gelenius, Rhea), "and his father Hyperion," because Cybele is
termed basi/leia; for which reading there seems no good
reason.-Immediately below, Ialysus is made the son, instead of, as in
Cicero, the grandson of the fourth; and again, Circe is said to be
mother, while Cicero speaks of her as the daughter of the fifth Sun.
These variations, viewed along with the general adherence to Cicero's
statements (*de N. D.*, iii. 21 sqq. ), seem to give good grounds for
adopting the explanation given above.

<span id="P7555_2378514"></span> <sup>76</sup> i.e.,

<span id="P7556_2378687"></span> <sup>77</sup> Lit., "of Jupiter, but
the third."

<span id="P7557_2379346"></span> <sup>78</sup> i.e., *incestorum
appetitorem.*

<span id="P7559_2379717"></span> <sup>79</sup> So Cicero (iii. 23); but
Clemens \[vol. ii. p. 179\] speaks of five, and notes that a sixth had
been mentioned.

<span id="P7561_2380658"></span> <sup>80</sup> Lit., "by the violence of
your terror." The preceding words are read in the ms. *ideo motos*-"so
moved by authority," and were emended *idonea*, as in the text, by
Gelenius.

<span id="P7562_2381284"></span> <sup>81</sup> Lit., "to what parts
shall we transfer the duties of pious service."

<span id="P7563_2381443"></span> <sup>82</sup> The ms. reads *cum
numen*; Rigaltius, followed by Oehler emending, as above, *meum*; the
first four edd., with Oberthür, *tum*-"then the deity *is mine*;" while
the rest read *cum numine*-"with the deity."

<span id="P7564_2381844"></span> <sup>83</sup> So LB., Orelli, and
Oehler, reading *tu tinnis* for the ms. *tutunis*.

<span id="P7565_2382036"></span> <sup>84</sup> *Capitoliis*. In the
Capitol were three shrines,-to Jove, Juno, and Minerva; and Roman
colonies followed the mother-state's example. Hence the present general
application of the term, which is found elsewhere in ecclesiastical
Latin.

<span id="P7566_2382391"></span> <sup>85</sup> Lit., "Nor are the forms
of married persons given to these by all artists;" *nec* read in all
edd. for the ms. *et*-"and of married," etc., which is opposed to the
context.

<span id="P7567_2382632"></span> <sup>86</sup> Lit., "not of your own
right."

<span id="P7568_2383330"></span> <sup>87</sup> *Concretione roris*-a
strange phrase. Cf. Her., iv. 180: "They say that Minerva is the
daughter of Poseidon and the Tritonian lake."

<span id="P7569_2383622"></span> <sup>88</sup> St. p. 21. The ms. reads
*quorum Nili lingua latonis*; the two Roman edd. merely insert *p.,
Plat.*; Gelenius and Canterus adding *dicor*-"in whose language I am
called the Nile's," *Nili* being changed into *Neith* by Elmenhorst and
later edd.

<span id="P7570_2384219"></span> <sup>89</sup> Lit., "take account of
herself."

<span id="P7571_2384385"></span> <sup>90</sup> So Ursinus suggested in
the margin for the ms. *si verum.*

<span id="P7572_2384534"></span> <sup>91</sup> The third Minerva now
addresses the fourth.

<span id="P7573_2385257"></span> <sup>92</sup> Lit., "approaching the
duties of religion."

<span id="P7574_2385964"></span> <sup>93</sup> According to the ms.
*sic*-"for so (i.e., as you do) yielding,"etc.

<span id="P7577_2387194"></span> <sup>94</sup> So all the edd., though
Orelli approves of *fictione* (edd.*-em*), which is, he says, the ms.
reading, "set forth with wanton fiction."

<span id="P7578_2388110"></span> <sup>95</sup> The ms. and earlier edd.,
with Hild. and Oehler, read *ex hominum de scriptis*; LB. and Orelli
inserting *his* after *de*, as above.

<span id="P7579_2388676"></span> <sup>96</sup> The ms. and both Roman
edd. read *esse*, which is clearly corrupt; for which LB. gives
*scripsisse* (misprinted *scripse*), as above.

<span id="P7580_2388932"></span> <sup>97</sup> i.e., "speak of them at
all."

<span id="P7581_2389012"></span> <sup>98</sup> Lit., "an idea of no
writing."

<span id="P7582_2389192"></span> <sup>99</sup> Lit., "been informed by
books suggesting to you," etc.

<span id="P7584_2389986"></span> <sup>100</sup> Lit., "does it not touch
the feeling of your mind."

<span id="P7585_2390174"></span> <sup>101</sup> Ursinus would supply
*eos*-"that they are so."

<span id="P7586_2390389"></span> <sup>102</sup> *Atque ex seminis,
actu*, or *jactu*, as the edd. except Hild. read it.

<span id="P7587_2390665"></span> <sup>103</sup> The ms. reads
*dignitati-s aut*; corrected, as above, *d. sane*, in the first five
edd., Oberthür, and Orelli. \[John x. 35.\]

<span id="P7588_2391034"></span> <sup>104</sup> *Quaesit foeditas ista
coeundi.*

<span id="P7589_2391155"></span> <sup>105</sup> Lit., "as far as to
themselves, their first generation being completed."

<span id="P7591_2391286"></span> <sup>106</sup> Lit., "forgetting the so
great majesty and sublimity."

<span id="P7592_2391409"></span> <sup>107</sup> Both plural.

<span id="P7593_2391459"></span> <sup>108</sup> Both plural.

<span id="P7594_2391813"></span> <sup>109</sup> The ms., first four
edd., and Oberthür read *conducunt*-"unite;" for which the rest read
*condic-unt*, as above.

<span id="P7595_2392029"></span> <sup>110</sup> i.e., *usu, farre,
coemptione.*

<span id="P7596_2392094"></span> <sup>111</sup> The word here translated
mistresses, *speratas*, is used of maidens loved, but not yet asked in
marriage.

<span id="P7597_2392618"></span> <sup>112</sup> Lit., "dangers of
destructions."

<span id="P7598_2392689"></span> <sup>113</sup> Instead of "occasioned,"
*sevisse*, which the later editions give, the ms. and first four edd.
read *saevisse*-"that danger and destruction raged against," etc.
