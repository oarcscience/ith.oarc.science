<SUP>139 </SUP><I>Consentes</I> (those who are together, or agree together, i. e, councillors) and <I>Complices</I> (confederate, or agreeing) are said by some to be the twelve gods who composed the great council of heaven; and, in accordance with this, the words <I>una oriantur et occidant una</I> might be translated "rise and sit down together," i.e., at the council table. But then, the names and number of these are known; while Arnobius says, immediately after, that the names of the dii Consentes are not known and has already quoted Varro, to the effect that neither names nor number are known. Schelling (&uuml;ber die Gotth. v. Samothr., quoted by Orelli) adopts the reading (see following note), "of whom very little mention is made," i.e., in prayers or rites, because they are merely Jove's councillors, and exercise no power over men, and identifies them with the Samothracian Cabiri-<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>Ka/beiroi</FONT> and Consentes being merely Greek and Latin renderings of the name. </P>

<SUP>156 </SUP>Cf. ch. 40, note 21. It may further be observed that the Etruscans held that the superior and inferior gods and men were linked together by a kind of intermediate beings, through whom the gods took cognizance of human affairs, without themselves descending to earth.
