days of Pythagoras, respecting *his* more enlightened system.\]

there were two Agathobuli with the surname Masters; but I fear that he
is wrong in his opinion that they were more ancient than Philo and
Josephus. For Agathobulus, the philosopher, flourished in the times of
Adrian, as Eusebius writes in his *Chronicon*, and after him Georgius
Syncellus.-Vales.

<span id="P2495_697274"></span> <sup>13</sup> Aristoboulou tou=
pa/nu-Rufinus erroneously renders it *Aristobulum ex Paneade*,
Aristobulus of Paneas. Scaliger also, in his *Animadversiones
Eusebianae*, p. 130, strangely thinks that the text should be corrected
from the version of Rufinus. And Bede, in his *De Ratione Computi*, also
follows the faulty rendering of Rufinus, and writes *Aristobulus et
Paniada*, as though the latter word were the proper name of a Jewish
writer, finding probably in the *Codex* of Rufinus, which he possessed,
the reading *Aristobulus et Paneada*, which indeed is found in a very
ancient Paris manuscript, and also in the *Codex Corbeiensis*. But that
that Aristobulus was not one of the seventy translators, as Anatolius
writes, is proved by Scaliger in the work cited above. This Aristobulus
was also surnamed dioa/skaloj, or *Master*, as we see from the
Maccabees, ii. 1. For I do not agree with Scaliger in distinguishing
this Aristobulus, of whom mention is made in the Maccabees, from the
Peripatetic philosopher who dedicated his *Commentaries on the Law of
Moses* to Ptolemy Philometor-Vales. \[See vol. ii. p. 487, and
Elucidation II. p. 520, same volume, this series.\]
