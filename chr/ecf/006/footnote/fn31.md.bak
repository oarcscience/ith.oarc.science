this Valesius gives the following note:-The Latins call these *litterae
communicatoriae*, the use of which is of very ancient date in the
Church. They called the same also *formatae*, as Augustine witnesses in
Epistle 163. There were, moreover, two kinds of them. For there were
some which were given to the clergy and laity when about to travel, that
they might be admitted to communion by foreign bishops. And there were
others which bishops were in the way of sending to other bishops, and
which they in turn received from others, for the purpose of attesting
their inter-communion; of which sort the Synod speaks here. These were
usually sent by recently-ordained bishops soon after their ordination.
Augustine, Epistle 162; Cyprian, in the Epistle to Cornelius, p. 320;
and the Synodical Epistle of the Council of Sardica, appear to refer to
these, though they may refer also to the *formatae.* \[Vol. i. p. 12, n.
