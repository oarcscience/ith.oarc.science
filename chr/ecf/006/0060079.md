##  An Exposition of the Chapters of the Acts of the Apostles.<sup>[1](footnote/fn30.htm#P3008_784412)</sup>

Having had ourselves the advantage of the method and model received from
our fathers and teachers, we attempt, in a modest way, to give these in
this exposition of the chapters, entreating your forgiveness for the
rashness of such an endeavour in us who are young in point both of years
and of study,<sup>[2](footnote/fn30.htm#P3010_785023)</sup> and looking
to have the indulgence<sup>[3](footnote/fn30.htm#P3011_785192)</sup> of
every one who reads this writing in prayer on our behalf. We make this
exposition, therefore, after the history of Luke, the evangelist and
historian. And, accordingly, we have indicated whole chapters by the
letters of the alphabet,<sup>[4](footnote/fn30.htm#P3012_785460)</sup>
and their subdivisions into parts we have noted by means of the
asterisk.<sup>[5](footnote/fn30.htm#P3013_785656)</sup>

nn. Of Paul's discourse with the Jews in Rome.

There are in all forty chapters; and the sections following these, and
marked with the asterisk,<sup>[36](footnote/fn30.htm#P3084_797118)</sup>
are forty-eight.
