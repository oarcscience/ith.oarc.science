##  From His Seven Books of Hypotyposes or Outlines.

--------

I.<sup>[1](footnote/fn27.md)</sup>

The substance<sup>[2](footnote/fn27.htm#P2779_738845.md)</sup> of the Son
is not a substance devised
extraneously,<sup>[3](footnote/fn27.htm#P2780_738907.md)</sup> nor is it
one introduced out of
nothing;<sup>[4](footnote/fn27.htm#P2781_738974.md)</sup> but it was born
of the substance of the Father, as the reflection of light or as the
steam of water. For the reflection is not the sun itself, and the steam
is not the water itself, nor yet again is it anything alien; *neither is
He Himself the Father, nor is He alien, but He
is*<sup>[5](footnote/fn27.htm#P2782_739284.md)</sup> an
emanation<sup>[6](footnote/fn27.htm#P2783_739454.md)</sup> from the
substance of the Father, this substance of the Father suffering the
while no partition. For as the sun remains the same and suffers no
diminution from the rays that are poured out by it, so neither did the
substance of the Father undergo any change in having the Son as an image
of itself.

II.<sup>[7](footnote/fn27.htm#P2786_739773.md)</sup>

Theognostus, moreover, himself adds words to this effect: He who has
offended against the first
term<sup>[8](footnote/fn27.htm#P2788_739949.md)</sup> and the second, may
be judged to deserve smaller punishment; but he who has also despised
the third, can no longer find pardon. For by the first term and the
second, he says, is meant the teaching concerning the Father and the
Son; but by the third is meant the doctrine committed to us with respect
to the perfection<sup>[9](footnote/fn27.htm#P2789_740277.md)</sup> and the
partaking of the Spirit. And with the view of confirming this, he
adduces the word spoken by the Saviour to the disciples: "I have yet
many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. But when the
Holy Spirit is come, He will teach
you."<sup>[10](footnote/fn27.htm#P2790_740598.md)</sup>

III.<sup>[11](footnote/fn27.htm#P2793_740626.md)</sup>

Then he says again: As the Saviour converses with those not yet able to
receive what is perfect,<sup>[12](footnote/fn27.htm#P2795_740763.md)</sup>
condescending to their littleness, while the Holy Spirit communes with
the perfected, and yet we could never say on that account that the
teaching of the Spirit is superior to the teaching of the Son, but only
that the Son condescends to the imperfect, while the Spirit is the seal
of the perfected; even so it is not on account of the superiority of the
Spirit over the Son that the blasphemy against the Spirit is a sin
excluding impunity and pardon, but because for the imperfect there is
pardon, while for those who have tasted the heavenly
gift,<sup>[13](footnote/fn27.htm#P2796_741332.md)</sup> and been made
perfect, there remains no plea or prayer for pardon.
