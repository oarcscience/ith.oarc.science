##  II.-Fragments Apparently of the Same Epistle of the Synod of Antioch

To Wit, of that Part of It Which It is Agreed that Eusebius Left
Unnoticed.<sup>[1](footnote/fn31.htm#P3130_808670.md)</sup>

------------

He says, therefore, in the commentaries (they speak of Paul), that he
maintains the dignity of wisdom.

*And thereafter:*

If, however, he had been
united<sup>[2](footnote/fn31.htm#P3137_809777.md)</sup> according to
formation and generation, this is what befalls the man. *And again*: For
that wisdom, as we believe, was not
congenerate<sup>[3](footnote/fn31.htm#P3138_809982.md)</sup> with humanity
substantially, but
qualitatively.<sup>[4](footnote/fn31.htm#P3139_810049.md)</sup>

*And thereafter:*

In what respect, moreover, does he mean to allege that the
formation<sup>[5](footnote/fn31.htm#P3144_810151.md)</sup> of Christ is
different and diverse from ours, when we hold that, in this one thing of
prime consequence, His constitution differs from ours, to wit, that what
in us is the interior man, is in Him the
Word.<sup>[6](footnote/fn31.htm#P3145_810381.md)</sup>

*And thereafter:*

If he means to allege that Wisdom dwells in Him as in no other, this
expresses indeed the same mode of inhabitation, though it makes it excel
in respect of measure and multitude; He being supposed to derive a
superior knowledge from the Wisdom, say for example, twice as large as
others, or any other number of times as large; or, again, it may be less
than twice as large a knowledge as others have. This, however, the
catholic and ecclesiastical canons disallow, and hold rather that other
men indeed received of Wisdom as an inspiration from without, which,
though with them, is distinct from
them;<sup>[7](footnote/fn31.htm#P3150_811015.md)</sup> but that Wisdom in
verity came of itself substantially into His body by Mary.

*And after other matters:*

And they hold that there are not two Sons. But if Jesus Christ is the
Son of God, and if Wisdom also is the Son of God; and if the Wisdom is
one thing and Jesus Christ another, there are two Sons.

*And thereafter:*

Moreover understand (Paul would say) the union with Wisdom in a
different sense, namely as being one according to instruction and
participation;<sup>[8](footnote/fn31.htm#P3159_811637.md)</sup> but not as
if it were formed according to the substance in the body.

*And after other matters:*

Neither was the God who bore the human body and had assumed it, without
knowledge<sup>[9](footnote/fn31.htm#P3164_811835.md)</sup> of human
affections<sup>[10](footnote/fn31.htm#P3165_812091.md)</sup> in the first
instance;<sup>[11](footnote/fn31.htm#P3166_812127.md)</sup> nor was the
human body without knowledge, in the first instance, of divine
operations in him in whom He (the God) was, and by whom He wrought these
operations. He was formed, in the first instance, as man in the womb;
and, in the second
instance,<sup>[12](footnote/fn31.htm#P3167_812402.md)</sup> the God also
was in the womb, united essentially with the
human,<sup>[13](footnote/fn31.htm#P3168_812487.md)</sup> that is to say,
His substance being wedded with the man.
