##  The Epistle of the Same Phileas of Thmuis to Meletius, Bishop of Lycopolis.

--------

Hesychius, Pachomius, Theodorus, and Phileas, to Meletius, our friend
and fellow-minister in the Lord, greeting. Some reports having reached
us concerning thee, which, on the testimony of certain individuals who
came to us, spake of certain things foreign to divine order and
ecclesiastical rule which are being attempted, yea, rather which are
being done by thee, we, in an ingenuous manner held them to be
untrustworthy, regarding them to be such as we would not willingly
credit, when we thought of the audacity implied in their magnitude and
their uncertain attempts. But since many who are visiting us at the
present time have lent some credibility to these reports, and have not
hesitated to attest them as facts, we, to our exceeding surprise, have
been compelled to indite this letter to thee. And what agitation and
sadness have been caused to us all in common and to each of us
individually by (the report of) the ordination carried through by thee
in parishes having no manner of connection with thee, we are unable
sufficiently to express. We have not delayed, however, by a short
statement to prove your practice wrong. There is the law of our fathers
and forefathers, of which neither art thou thyself ignorant, established
according to divine and ecclesiastical order; for it is all for the good
pleasure of God and the zealous regard. of better
things.<sup>[2](footnote/fn29.htm#P2968_774577.md)</sup> By them it has
been established and settled that it is not lawful for any bishop to
celebrate ordinations in other
parishes<sup>[3](footnote/fn29.htm#P2969_774719.md)</sup> than his own; a
law which is exceedingly
important<sup>[4](footnote/fn29.htm#P2970_774972.md)</sup> and wisely
devised. For, in the first place, it is but right that the conversation
and life of those who are ordained should be examined with great care;
and in the second place, that all confusion and turbulence should be
done away with. For every one shall have enough to do in managing his
own parish, and in finding with great care and many anxieties suitable
subordinates *among these* with whom he has passed his whole life, and
who have been trained under his hands. But thou, neither making any
account of these things, nor regarding the future, nor considering the
law of our sainted fathers and those who have been taken to Christ time
after time. nor the honour of our great bishop and
father,<sup>[5](footnote/fn29.htm#P2971_775697.md)</sup>
Peter,<sup>[6](footnote/fn29.htm#P2972_775817.md)</sup> on whom we all
depend in the hope which we have in the Lord Jesus Christ, nor softened
by our imprisonments and trials, and daily and multiplied reproach, hast
ventured on subverting all things at once. And what means will be left
thee for justifying thyself with respect to these things? But perhaps
thou wilt say: I did this to prevent many being drawn away with the
unbelief of many, because the flocks were in need and forsaken, there
being no pastor with them. Well, but it is most certain that they are
not in such destitution: in the first place, because there are many
going about them and in a position to act as visitors; and in the second
place, even if there was some measure of neglect on their side, then the
proper way would have been for the representation to be made promptly by
the people, and for us to take account of them according to their
desert.<sup>[7](footnote/fn29.htm#P2973_776820.md)</sup> But they knew that
they were in no want of ministers, and therefore they did not come to
seek them. They knew that we were wont to discharge them with an
admonition from such inquisition for matter of complaint, or that
everything was done with all carefulness which seemed to be for their
profit; for all was done under
correction,<sup>[8](footnote/fn29.htm#P2974_777214.md)</sup> and all was
considered with well-approved honesty. Thou, however, giving such
strenuous attention to the deceits of certain parties and their vain
words, hast made a stealthy leap to the celebrating of ordinations. For
if, indeed, those with thee were constraining thee to this, and in their
ignorance were doing violence to ecclesiastical order, thou oughtest to
have followed the common rule and have informed us by letter; and in
that way what seemed expedient would have been done. And if perchance
some persuaded you to credit their story that it was all over with us,-a
thing of which thou couldest not have been ignorant, because there were
many passing and repassing by us who might visit you,-even although, I
say, this had been the case, yet thou oughtest to have waited for the
judgment of the superior father and for his allowance of this practice.
But without giving any heed to these matters, I but indulging a
different expectation, yea rather, indeed, denying all respect to us,
thou hast provided certain rulers for the people. For now we have
learned, too, that there were also
divisions,<sup>[9](footnote/fn29.htm#P2975_778338.md)</sup> because thy
unwarrantable exercise of the right of ordination displeased many. And
thou wert not persuaded to delay such procedure or restrain thy purpose
readily even by the word of the Apostle Paul, the most blessed
seer,<sup>[10](footnote/fn29.htm#P2976_778631.md)</sup> and the man who put
on Christ, who is the Christ of all of us no less; for he, in writing to
his dearly-beloved son Timothy, says: "Lay hands suddenly on no man,
neither be partaker of other men's
sins."<sup>[11](footnote/fn29.htm#P2977_778969.md)</sup> And thus he at
once shows his own anxious consideration for
him,<sup>[12](footnote/fn29.htm#P2978_779053.md)</sup> and gives him his
example and exhibits the law according to which, with all carefulness
and caution, parties are to be chosen for the honour of
ordination.<sup>[13](footnote/fn29.htm#P2979_779239.md)</sup> We make this
declaration to thee, that in future thou mayest
study<sup>[14](footnote/fn29.htm#P2980_779399.md)</sup> to keep within the
safe and salutary limits of the law.

After receiving and perusing this epistle, he neither wrote any reply
nor repaired to them in the prison, nor went to the blessed Peter. But
when all these bishops and presbyters and deacons had suffered martyrdom
in the prison at Alexandria, be at once entered Alexandria. Now in that
city there was a certain person, by name Isidorus, turbulent in
character, and possessed with the ambition of being a teacher. And there
was also a certain Arius, who wore the habit of piety, and was in like
manner possessed with the ambition to be a teacher. And when they
discovered the object of Meletius's
passion<sup>[15](footnote/fn29.htm#P2984_780138.md)</sup> and what it was
that he sought, hastening to him, and looking with an evil eye on the
episcopal authority of the blessed Peter, that the aim and desire of
Meletius might be made
patent,<sup>[16](footnote/fn29.htm#P2985_780342.md)</sup> they discovered
to Meletius certain presbyters, then in hiding, to whom the blessed
Peter had given power to act as parish-visitors. And Meletius
recommending them to improve the opportunity given them for rectifying
their error, suspended them for the time, and by his own authority
ordained two persons in their
place,<sup>[17](footnote/fn29.htm#P2986_780707.md)</sup> namely, one in
prison and another in the mines. On learning these things the blessed
Peter, with much endurance, wrote to the people of Alexandria an epistle
in the following terms.<sup>[18](footnote/fn29.htm#P2987_781014.md)</sup>
