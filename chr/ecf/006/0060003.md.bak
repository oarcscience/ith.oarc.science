##  Introductory Note to Gregory Thaumaturgus

--------

\[A.D. 205-240-265.\] Alexandria continues to be the head of Christian
learning. It is delightful to trace the hand of God from generation to
generation, as from father to son, interposing for the perpetuity of the
faith. We have already observed the continuity of the great Alexandrian
school: how it arose, and how Pantaenus begat Clement, and Clement begat
Origen. So Origen begat Gregory, and so the Lord has provided for the
spiritual generation of the Church's teachers, age after age, from the
beginning. Truly, the Lord gave to Origen a holy seed, better than
natural sons and daughters; as if, for his comfort, Isaiah had written,
forbidding him to say, "I am a dry tree."

Our Gregory has given us not a little of his personal adventures in his
panegyric upon his master, and for his further history the reader need
only be referred to what follows. But I am anxious to supply the dates,
which are too loosely left to conjecture. As he was ordained a bishop
"very young," according to Eusebius, I suppose he must have been far
enough under *fifty*, the age prescribed by the "Apostolic Canons" (so
called), though probably not younger than *thirty*, the earliest
canonical limit for the ordination of a presbyter. If we decide upon
*five and thirty*, as a mean reckoning, we may with some confidence set
his birth at A.D. 205, dating back from his episcopate, which began A.D.
240. He was a native of Neo-Caesarea, the chief city of Pontus,-a fact
that should modify what we have learned about Pontus from Tertullian. He
was born of heathen parentage, and lived like other Gentile boys until
his fourteenth year (*circa* A.D. 218), with the disadvantage of being
more than ordinarily imbued by a mistaken father in the polytheism of
Greece. At this period his father died; but his mother, carrying out the
wishes of her husband, seems to have been not less zealous in furthering
his education according to her pagan ideas. He was, evidently, the
inheritor of moderate wealth; and, with his brother Athenodorus, he was
placed under an accomplished teacher of grammar and rhetoric, from whom
also he acquired a considerable knowledge of the Latin tongue. He was
persuaded by the same master to use this accomplishment in acquiring
some knowledge of the Roman laws. This is a very important point in his
biography, and it brings us to an epoch in Christian history too little
noted by any writer. I shall return to it very soon. We find him next
going to Alexandria to study the New Platonism. He speaks of himself as
already prepossessed with Christian ideas, which came to him even in his
boyhood, about the time when his father died. But it was not at
Alexandria that he began his acquaintance with Christian learning. Next
he seems to have travelled into Greece, and to have studied at Athens.
But the great interest of his autobiography begins with the providential
incidents, devoutly narrated by himself, which engaged him in a journey
to Berytus just as Origen reached Caesarea, A.D. 233, making it for a
time his home and the seat of his school. His own good angel, as Gregory
supposes, led him away from Berytus, where he purposed to prosecute his
legal studies, and brought him to the feet of Origen, his Gamaliel; and
"from the very first day of his receiving us," he says, "the true Sun
began to rise upon me." This he accounts the beginning of his true life;
and, if we are right as to our dates, he was now about twenty-seven
years of age.

If he tarried even a little while in Berytus, as seems probable, his
knowledge of law was, doubtless, somewhat advanced. It was the seat of
that school in which Roman law began its existence in the forms long
afterward digested into the Pandects of Justinian. That emperor speaks
of Berytus as "the mother and nurse" of the civil law. Caius, whose
*Institutes* were discovered in 1820 by the sagacity of Niebuhr, seems
to have been a Syrian. So were Papinian and Ulpian: and, heathen as they
were, they lived under the illumination reflected from Antioch; and, not
less than the Antonines, they were examples of a philosophic
regeneration which never could have existed until the Christian era had
begun its triumphs. Of this sort of pagan philosophy Julian became
afterwards the grand embodiment; and in Julian's grudging confessions of
what he had learned from Christianity we have a key to the secret
convictions of others, such as I have named; characters in whom, as in
Plutarch and in many retrograde unbelievers of our day, we detect the
operation of influences they are unwilling to acknowledge; of which,
possibly, they are blindly unconscious themselves. Roman law, I
maintain, therefore, indirectly owes its origin, as it is directly
indebted for its completion in the Pandects, to the new powers and
processes of thought which came from "the Light of the World." It was
light from Galilee and Golgotha, answering Pilate's question in the
inward convictions of many a heathen sage.

It is most interesting, therefore, to find in our Gregory one who had
come into contact with Berytus at this period. He describes it as
already dignified by this school of law, and therefore Latinized in some
degree by its influence. Most suggestive is what he says of this school:
"I refer to those admirable laws *of our sages*, by which the affairs of
all the subjects of the Roman Empire *are now* directed, and which are
neither digested nor learnt without difficulty. They are wise and strict
(if not *pious*) in themselves, they are manifold and admirable, and, in
a word, *most thoroughly Grecian, although* expressed and delivered to
us in the Roman tongue, which is a wonderful and magnificent sort of
language, and one very aptly conformable to imperial authority, but
still difficult to me." Nor is this the only noteworthy tribute of our
author to Roman law while yet that sublime system was in its cradle. The
rhetorician who introduced him to it and to the Latin tongue was its
enthusiastic eulogist; and Gregory says he learned the laws "in a
*thorough way,* by his help.... And he said one thing to me which has
proved to me the truest of all his sayings; to wit, that *my education
in the laws* would be my greatest *viaticum*,-my e0fo/dion (for thus he
phrased it);" i.e., for the journey of life. This man, one can hardly
doubt, was a disciple of Caius (or Gaius); and there is little question
that the *digested* system which Gregory eulogizes was "the Institutes"
of that great father of the civil law, now recovered from a palimpsest,
and made known to our own age, with no less benefit to jurisprudence
than the discovery of the *Philosophumena* has conferred on theology.

Thus Gregory's *Panegyric* throws light on the origin of Roman law. He
claims it for "our sages," meaning men of the East, whose vernacular was
the Greek tongue. Caius was probably, like the Gaius of Scripture, an
Oriental who had borrowed a Latin name, as did the Apostle of the
Gentiles and many others. If he was a native of Berytus, as seems
probable, that accounts for the rise of the school of laws at a place
comparatively inconsiderable. Hadrian, in his journey to Palestine,
would naturally discover and patronize such a jurist; and that accounts
for the appearance of Caius at Rome in his day. Papinian and Ulpian,
both Orientals, were his pupils in all probability; and these were the
"sages" with whose works the youthful Gregory became acquainted, and by
which his mind was prepared for the great influence he exerted in the
East, where his name is a power to this day.

His credit with our times is rather impaired than heightened by the
epithet *Thaumaturgus*, which clings to his name as a convenient
specification, to distinguish him from the other Gregories whose period
was so nearly his own. But why make it his opprobrium? He is not
responsible for the romances that sprung up after his death; which he
never heard of nor imagined. Like the great Friar Bacon, who was
considered a magician, or Faust, whose invention nearly cost him his
life, the reputation of Gregory made him the subject of legendary lore
long after he was gone. It is not impossible that God wrought marvels by
his hand, but a single instance would give rise to many fables; and this
very surname is of itself a monument of the fact that miracles were now
of rare occurrence, and that one possessing the gift was a wonder to his
contemporaries.

To like popular love of the marvellous I attribute the stupid story of a
mock consecration by Phaedimus. If a slight irregularity in Origen's
ordination gave him such lifelong troubles, what would not have been the
tumult such a sacrilege as this would have occasioned? Nothing is more
probable than that Phaedimus related such things as having occurred in a
vision; and this might have weighed with a mind like Gregory's to
overcome his scruples, and to justify his acceptance of such a position
at an early age.

We are already acquainted with the eloquent letter of Origen that
decided him to choose the sacred calling after he left the school at
Caesarea. The *Panegyric*, which was his valedictory, doubtless called
forth that letter. Origen had seen in him the makings of a kh=rnc, and
coveted such another Timothy for the Master's work. But the *Panegyric*
itself abounds with faults, and greatly resembles similar college
performances of our day. The custom of schools alone can excuse the
expression of such enthusiastic praise in the presence of its subject;
but Origen doubtless bore it as philosophically as others have done
since, and its evident sincerity and heartfelt gratitude redeem it from
the charge of fulsome adulation.

For the residue of the story I may refer my readers to the statements of
the translator, as follows:-
