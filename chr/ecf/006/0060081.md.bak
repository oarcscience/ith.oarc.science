##  TRANSLATOR'S BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.

\[a.d. 270.\] Eusebius<sup>[1](footnote/fn30.md)</sup> speaks of Malchion
as a man accomplished in other branches of
learning<sup>[2](footnote/fn30.htm#P3098_797366.md)</sup> and well-versed
in Greek letters in particular, and as holding the presidency of the
Sophists' school at Antioch. Jerome says that he taught rhetoric most
successfully in the same city. Nor was it only that he excelled in
secular erudition; but for the earnest sincerity of his Christian faith
he obtained the dignity of presbyter in the church of that place, as
Eusebius also tells us. He took part in the Synod of Antioch, which
Eusebius calls the final council, and which Gallandi and others call the
*second*, in opposition to Pearson, who holds that there was but one
council at Antioch. This synod met apparently about a.d. 269, and dealt
with Paul of Samosata, who had introduced the heresy of Artemon into the
church of Antioch; and Eusebius says that Malchion was the only one who,
in the discussion which took place there with the arch-heretic, and
which was taken down by stenographers who were present, was able to
detect the subtle and crafty sentiments of the man. Paul's real opinions
being thus unveiled, after he had baffled the acuteness of his
ecclesiastical judges for some time, he was at length convicted; and the
discussion was published, and a synodical epistle was sent on the
subject to Dionysius, bishop of Rome, and to Maximus of Alexandria, and
to all the provinces, which, according to Jerome (*De vir. illustr*.,
ch. 71), was written by Malchion, and of which we have extracts in
Eusebius.
