##  Elucidation.

Petavius, to whom the translator refers his readers, may be trusted in
points where he has no theory of his own to sustain, but must always be
accepted with caution. The Greek Fathers in this very series, from
Justin<sup>[11](footnote/fn9.htm#P900_248207.md)</sup> onward, enable us to
put the later terminology to the test of earlier exposition (see
examples in the notes to the Praxeas of Tertullian, and consult Dr.
Holmes' valuable note embodied in my
elucidations).<sup>[12](footnote/fn9.htm#P901_248502.md)</sup> We may go
back to Theophilus for the distinction between the e0ndia/qeto and the
proforiko/, the immanent and the uttered
Word.<sup>[13](footnote/fn9.htm#P902_248708.md)</sup> Compare Tertullian,
also, against Marcion.<sup>[14](footnote/fn9.htm#P903_248805.md)</sup>
Evidences, therefore, are abundant and *archaic*, indeed, to prove that
the Ante-Nicene Fathers, with those of the Nicene and the Post-Nicene
periods, were of one mind, and virtually of one voice.
