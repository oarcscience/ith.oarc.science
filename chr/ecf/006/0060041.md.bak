##  V.-On John VIII. 12.<sup>[1](footnote/fn20.htm#P2063_594836.md)</sup>

------------

Now this word "I am" expresses His eternal subsistence. For if He is the
reflection of the eternal light, He must also be eternal Himself. For if
the light subsists for ever, it is evident that the reflection also
subsists for ever. And that this light subsists, is known only by its
shining; neither can there be a light that does not give light. We come
back, therefore, to our illustrations. If there is day, there is light;
and if there is no such thing, the sun certainly cannot be
present.<sup>[2](footnote/fn20.htm#P2066_595457.md)</sup> If, therefore,
the sun had been eternal, there would also have been endless day. Now,
however, as it is not so, the day begins when the sun rises, and it ends
when the sun sets. But God is eternal light, having neither beginning
nor end. And along with Him there is the reflection, also without
beginning, and everlasting. The Father, then, being eternal, the Son is
also eternal, being light of light; and if God is the light, Christ is
the reflection; and if God is also a Spirit, as it is written, "God is a
Spirit," Christ, again, is called analogously
Spirit.<sup>[3](footnote/fn20.htm#P2067_596080.md)</sup>
