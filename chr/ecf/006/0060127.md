##  Elucidations.

The candid Dupin<sup>[62](footnote/fn62.htm#P6222_1911962.md)</sup> says
that we owe this to Pere
Combefis,<sup>[63](footnote/fn62.htm#P6223_1912047.md)</sup> on the
authority of a Ms. in the Royal Library of Paris. It appeared in Sir
Henry Savile's edition of Chrysostom ascribed to that Father. Dupin
doubts as to parts of this homily, if not as to the whole. He adds, "The
style of Methodius is Asiatic, diffuse, swelling, and abounding in
epithet. His expressions are figurative, and the turn of his sentences
artificial. He is full of similitudes and far-fetched allegories. His
thoughts are mysterious, and he uses many words to say a few things."
His doctrine, apart from these faults, is sound, and free from some
errors common to the ancients: such faults as I have frequently
apologized for in Origen, whom Methodius so generally condemns.
