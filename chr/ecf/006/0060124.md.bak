##  General Note.

The Banquet appears to me a genuine work, although, like other writings
of this Father, it may have been corrupted. Tokens of such corruptions
are not wanting, and there can be little doubt that Methodius the
monkish artist and missionary of the ninth century has been often copied
into the works of his earlier namesake.<sup>[19](footnote/fn59.md)</sup>

In a fragment, for example, found on a preceding
page,<sup>[20](footnote/fn59.htm#P5997_1831299.md)</sup> there is a passage
on God's image in angels and men, which appears in its more probable
form in another
fragment,<sup>[21](footnote/fn59.htm#P5998_1831441.md)</sup> discovered by
Combefis. As quoted by St. John Damascene, it is enough to say of it,
with the candid Dupin, "*I very much question whether the passage
belongs to Methodius*; or, if it does, it must be taken in another
sense<sup>[22](footnote/fn59.htm#P5999_1831702.md)</sup> than that in which
Damascene understood it, as the words which immediately precede seem to
intimate." That it is a positive *anachronism* in any other sense, is
proved by the history of Images, on which see Epiphanius, quoted by
Faber, *Difficulties of Romanism*, p. 488, ed. 1830. He gives St.
Jerome, *Opp., ii*. p. 177. A learned friend suggests that the Rev. J.
Endell Tyler's popular work on *Primitive Christian* Worship may supply
an accessible reference.<sup>[23](footnote/fn60.htm#P6000_1832276.md)</sup>
It is a very good thought, for the whole book is worth reading, on other
points also.
