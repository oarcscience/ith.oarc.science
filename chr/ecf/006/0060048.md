I.

\[Africanus ON The Genealogy IN The Holy
Gospels.\]<sup>[1](footnote/fn21.htm#P2134_605254.md)</sup> -Some indeed
incorrectly allege that this discrepant enumeration and mixing of the
names both of priestly men, as they think, and royal, was made
properly,<sup>[2](footnote/fn21.htm#P2135_605953.md)</sup> in order that
Christ might be shown rightfully to be both Priest and King; as if any
one disbelieved this, or had any other hope than this, that Christ is
the High Priest of His Father, who presents our prayers to Him, and a
supramundane King, who rules by the Spirit those whom He has delivered,
a cooperator in the government of all things. And this is announced to
us not by the catalogue of the tribes, nor by the mixing of the
registered generations, but by the patriarchs and prophets. Let us not
therefore descend to such religious trifling as to establish the
kingship and priesthood of Christ by the interchanges of the names. For
the priestly tribe of Levi, too, was allied with the kingly tribe of
Juda, through the circumstance that Aaron married Elizabeth the l sister
of Naasson,<sup>[3](footnote/fn21.htm#P2136_606760.md)</sup> and that
Eleazar again married the daughter of
Phatiel,<sup>[4](footnote/fn21.htm#P2137_606831.md)</sup> and begat
children. The evangelists, therefore, would thus have spoken falsely,
affirming what was not truth, but a fictitious commendation. And for
this reason the one traced the pedigree of Jacob the father of Joseph
from David through Solomon; the other traced that of Heli also, though
in a different way, the father of Joseph, from Nathan the son of David.
And they ought not indeed to have been ignorant that both orders of the
ancestors enumerated are the generation of David, the royal tribe of
Juda.<sup>[5](footnote/fn21.htm#P2138_607355.md)</sup> For if Nathan was a
prophet, so also was Solomon, and so too the father of both of them; and
there were prophets belonging to many of the tribes, but priests
belonging to none of the tribes, save the Levites only. To no purpose,
then, is this fabrication of theirs. Nor shall an assertion of this kind
prevail in the Church of Christ against the exact truth, so as that a
lie should be contrived for the praise and glory of Christ. For who does
not know that most holy word of the apostle also, who, when he was
preaching and proclaiming the resurrection of our Saviour, and
confidently affirming the truth, said with great fear, "If any say that
Christ is not risen, and we assert and have believed this, and both hope
for and preach that very thing, we are false witnesses of God, in
alleging that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up?
"<sup>[6](footnote/fn21.htm#P2139_608220.md)</sup> And if he who glorifies
God the Father is thus afraid lest he should seem a false witness in
narrating a marvellous fact, how should not he be justly afraid, who
tries to establish the truth by a false statement, preparing an untrue
opinion? For if the generations are different, and trace down no genuine
seed to Joseph, and if all has been stated only with the view of
establishing the position of Him who was to be born-to confirm the
truth, namely, that He who was to be would be king and priest, there
being at the same tune no proof given, but the dignity of the words
being brought down to a feeble hymn,-it is evident that no praise
accrues to God from that, since it is a falsehood, but rather judgment
returns on him who asserts it, because he vaunts an unreality as though
it were reality. Therefore, that we may expose the ignorance also of him
who speaks thus, and prevent any one from stumbling at this folly, I
shall set forth the true history of these matters.\]

II.

For<sup>[7](footnote/fn21.htm#P2143_609227.md)</sup> whereas in Israel the
names of their generations were enumerated either according to nature or
according to law,-according to nature, indeed, by the succession of
legitimate offspring, and according to law whenever another raised up
children to the name of a brother dying childless; for because no clear
hope of resurrection was yet given them, they had a representation of
the future promise in a kind of mortal resurrection, with the view of
perpetuating the name of one deceased;-whereas, then, of those entered
in this genealogy, some succeeded by legitimate descent as son to
father, while others begotten in one family were introduced to another
in name, mention is therefore made of both-of those who were progenitors
in fact, and of those who were so only in name. Thus neither of the
evangelists is in error, as the one reckons by nature and the other by
law. For the several generations, viz., those descending from Solomon
and those from Nathan, were so
intermingled<sup>[8](footnote/fn21.htm#P2144_610249.md)</sup> by the
raising up of children to the
childless,<sup>[9](footnote/fn21.htm#P2145_610507.md)</sup> and by second
marriages, and the raising up of seed, that the same persons are quite
justly reckoned to belong at one time to the one, and at another to the
other, i.e., to their reputed or to their actual fathers. And hence it
is that both these accounts are true, and come down to Joseph, with
considerable intricacy indeed, but yet quite accurately.

III.

But in order that what I have said may be made evident, I shall explain
the interchange<sup>[10](footnote/fn21.htm#P2149_611054.md)</sup> of the
generations. If we reckon the generations from David through Solomon,
Matthan is found to be the third from the end, who begat Jacob the
father of Joseph. But if, with Luke, we reckon them from Nathan the son
of David, in like manner the third from the end is Melchi, whose son was
Heli the father of Joseph. For Joseph was the son of Hell, the son of
Melchi.<sup>[11](footnote/fn21.htm#P2150_611565.md)</sup> As Joseph,
therefore, is the object proposed to us, we have to show how it is that
each is represented as his father, both Jacob as descending from
Solomon, and Heli as descending from Nathan: first, how these two, Jacob
and Heli, were brothers; and then also how the fathers of these, Matthan
and Melchi, being of different families, are shown to be the
grandfathers of Joseph. Well, then, Matthan and Melchi, having taken the
same woman to wife in succession, begat children who were uterine
brothers, as the law did not prevent a
widow,<sup>[12](footnote/fn21.htm#P2151_612308.md)</sup> whether such by
divorce or by the death of her husband, from marrying another. By Estha,
then-for such is her name according to tradition-Matthan first, the
descendant of Solomon, begets Jacob; and on Matthan's death, Melchi, who
traces his descent back to Nathan, being of the same tribe but of
another family, having married her, as has been already said, had a son
Hell. Thus, then, we shall find Jacob and Hell uterine brothers, though
of different families. And of these, the one Jacob having taken the wife
of his brother Heli, who died childless, begat by her the third,
Joseph-his son by nature and by
account.<sup>[13](footnote/fn21.htm#P2152_613030.md)</sup> Whence also it
is written, "And Jacob begat Joseph." But according to law he was the
son of Heli, for Jacob his brother raised up seed to him. Wherefore also
the genealogy deduced through him will not be made void, which the
Evangelist Matthew in his enumeration gives thus: "And Jacob begat
Joseph." But Luke, on the other hand, says, "Who was the son, as was
supposed<sup>[14](footnote/fn21.htm#P2153_613419.md)</sup> (for this, too,
he adds), of Joseph, the son of Heli, the son of Metchi." For it was not
possible more distinctly to state the generation according to law; and
thus in this mode of generation he has entirely omitted the word "begat"
to the very end, carrying back the genealogy by way of conclusion to
Adam and to God.<sup>[15](footnote/fn21.htm#P2154_614466.md)</sup>

IV.

Nor indeed is this incapable of proof, neither is it a rash conjecture.
For the kinsmen of the Saviour after the flesh, whether to magnify their
own origin or simply to state the fact, but at all events speaking
truth, have also handed down the following account: Some Idumean robbers
attacking Ascalon, a city of Palestine, besides other spoils which they
took from a temple of Apollo, which was built near the walls, carried
off captive one Antipater, son of a certain Herod, a servant of the
temple. And as the priest<sup>[16](footnote/fn21.htm#P2158_615035.md)</sup>
was not able to pay the ransom for his son, Antipater was brought up in
the customs of the Idumeans, and afterwards enjoyed the friendship of
Hyrcanus, the high priest of Judea. And being sent on an embassy to
Pompey on behalf of Hyrcanus. and having restored to him the kingdom
which was being wasted by Aristobulus his brother, he was so fortunate
as to obtain the title of procurator of
Palestine.<sup>[17](footnote/fn21.htm#P2159_615552.md)</sup> And when
Antipater was treacherously slain through envy of his great good
fortune, his son Herod succeeded him, who was afterwards appointed king
of Judea under Antony and Augustus by a decree of the senate. His sons
were Herod and the other tetrarchs. These accounts are given also in the
histories of the Greeks.<sup>[18](footnote/fn21.htm#P2160_615977.md)</sup>

V.

But as up to that time the genealogies of the Hebrews had been
registered in the public archives, and those, too, which were traced
back to the proselytes<sup>[19](footnote/fn21.htm#P2164_616554.md)</sup>
-as, for example, to Achior the Ammanite, and Ruth the Moabitess, and
those who left Egypt along with the Israelites, and intermarried with
them-Herod, knowing that the lineage of the Israelites contributed
nothing to him, and goaded by the consciousness of his ignoble birth,
burned the registers of their families. This he did, thinking that he
would appear to be of noble birth, if no one else could trace back his
descent by the public register to the patriarchs or proselytes, and to
that mixed race called
*georae*.<sup>[20](footnote/fn21.htm#P2165_617397.md)</sup> A few, however,
of the studious, having private records of their own, either by
remembering the names or by getting at them in some other way from the
archives, pride themselves in preserving the memory of their noble
descent; and among these happen to be those already mentioned, called
*desposyni*,<sup>[21](footnote/fn21.htm#P2166_618161.md)</sup> on account
of their connection with the family of the Saviour. And these coming
from Nazara and Cochaba, Judean villages, to other parts of the country,
set forth the above-named
genealogy<sup>[22](footnote/fn21.htm#P2167_618572.md)</sup> as accurately
as possible from the Book of
Days.<sup>[23](footnote/fn21.htm#P2168_618672.md)</sup> Whether, then, the
case stand thus or not, no one could discover a more obvious
explanation, according to my own opinion and that of any sound judge.
And let this suffice us for the matter, although it is not supported by
testimony, because we have nothing more satisfactory or true to allege
upon it. The Gospel, however, in any case states the truth.

VI.

Matthan, descended from Solomon, begat Jacob. Matthan dying, Melchi,
descended from Nathan, begat Hell by the same wife. Therefore Hell and
Jacob are uterine brothers. Hell dying childless, Jacob raised up seed
to him and begat Joseph, his own son by nature, but the son of Hell by
law. Thus Joseph was the son of
both.<sup>[24](footnote/fn21.htm#P2172_620220.md)</sup>
