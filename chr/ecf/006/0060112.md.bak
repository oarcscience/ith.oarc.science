##  Discourse III.-Thaleia.

You seem to me, O Theophila, to excel all in action and in speech, and
to be second to none in wisdom. For there is no one who will find fault
with your discourse, however contentious and contradictory he may be.
Yet, while everything else seems rightly spoken, one thing, my friend,
distresses and troubles me, considering that that wise and most
spiritual man-I mean Paul-would not vainly refer to Christ and the
Church the union of the first man and
woman,<sup>[2](footnote/fn49.htm#P4961_1494996.md)</sup> if the Scripture
meant nothing higher than what is conveyed by the mere words and the
history; for if we are to take the Scripture as a bare representation
wholly referring to the union of man and woman, for what reason should
the apostle, calling these things to remembrance, and guiding us, as I
opine, into the way of the Spirit, allegorize the history of Adam and
Eve as having a reference to Christ and the Church? For the passage in
Genesis reads thus: "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and
flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out
of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one
flesh."<sup>[3](footnote/fn49.htm#P4962_1495740.md)</sup> But the apostle
considering this passage, by no means, as I said, intends to take it
according to its mere natural sense, as referring to the union of man
and woman, as you do; for you, explaining the passage in too natural a
sense, laid down that the Spirit is speaking only of conception and
births; that the bone taken from the bones was made another man, and
that living creatures coming together swell like trees at the time of
conception. But he, more spiritually referring the passage to Christ,
thus teaches: "He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever
yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the
Lord the Church: for we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of
His bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is
a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
Church."<sup>[4](footnote/fn49.htm#P4963_1496682.md)</sup>

Let it not disturb you, if, in discussing one class of subjects, he,
i.e., *Paul*, should pass over into another, so as to appear to mix them
up, and to import matters foreign to the subject under consideration,
departing from the question, as now for instance. For wishing, as it
seems, to strengthen most carefully the argument on behalf of chastity,
he prepares the mode of argument beforehand, beginning with the more
persuasive mode of speech. For the character of his speech being very
various, and arranged for the purpose of progressive proof, begins
gently, but flows forward into a style which is loftier and more
magnificent. And then, again changing to what is deep, he sometimes
finishes with what is simple and easy, and sometimes with what is more
difficult and delicate; and yet introducing nothing which is foreign to
the subject by these changes, but, bringing them all together according
to a certain marvellous relationship, he works into one the question
which is set forth as his subject. It is needful, then, that I should
more accurately unfold the meaning of the apostle's arguments, yet
rejecting nothing of what has been said before. For you seem to me, O
Theophila, to have discussed those words of the Scripture amply and
clearly, and to have set them forth as they are without mistake. For it
is a dangerous thing wholly to despise the literal
meaning,<sup>[5](footnote/fn49.htm#P4967_1498293.md)</sup> as has been
said, and especially of Genesis, where the unchangeable decrees of God
for the constitution of the universe are set forth, in agreement with
which, even until now, the world is perfectly ordered, most beautifully
in accordance with a perfect rule, until the Lawgiver Himself having
re-arranged it, wishing to order it anew, shall break up the first laws
of nature by a fresh disposition. But, since it is not fitting to leave
the demonstration of the argument unexamined-and, so to speak,
half-lame-come let us, as it were completing our pair, bring forth the
analogical sense, looking more deeply into the Scripture; for Paul is
not to be despised when he passes over the literal meaning, and shows
that the words extend to Christ and the Church.

And, first, we must inquire if Adam can be likened to the Son of God,
when he was found in the transgression of the Fall, and heard the
sentence, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
return."<sup>[6](footnote/fn49.htm#P4971_1499646.md)</sup> For how shall he
be considered "the first-born of every
creature,"<sup>[7](footnote/fn49.htm#P4972_1499730.md)</sup> who, after the
creation of the earth and the firmament, was formed out of clay? And how
shall he be admitted to be "the tree of life" who was cast out for his
transgression,<sup>[8](footnote/fn49.htm#P4973_1499919.md)</sup> lest "he
should again stretch forth his hand and eat of it, and live forever?
"<sup>[9](footnote/fn49.htm#P4974_1500014.md)</sup> For it is necessary
that a thing which is likened unto anything else, should in many
respects be similar and analogous to that of which it is the similitude,
and not have its constitution opposite and dissimilar. For one who
should venture to compare the uneven to the even, or harmony to discord,
would not be considered rational. But the even should be compared to
that which in its nature is even, although it should be even only in a
small measure; and the white to that which in its nature is white, even
although it should be very small, and should show but moderately the
whiteness by reason of which it is called white. Now, it is beyond all
doubt clear to every one, that that which is sinless and incorrupt is
even, and harmonious, and bright as wisdom; but that that which is
mortal and sinful is uneven and discordant, and cast out as guilty and
subject to condemnation.

Such, then, I consider to be the objections urged by many who,
despising, as it seems, the wisdom of Paul, dislike the comparing of the
first man to Christ. For come, let us consider how rightly Paul compared
Adam to Christ, not only considering him to be the type and image, but
also that Christ Himself became the very same
thing,<sup>[10](footnote/fn49.htm#P4978_1501386.md)</sup> because the
Eternal Word fell upon Him. For it was fitting that the first-born of
God, the first shoot, the only-begotten, even the wisdom of God, should
be joined to the first-formed man, and first and first-born of mankind,
and should become incarnate. And this was Christ, a man filled with the
pure and perfect Godhead, and God received into man. For it was most
suitable that the oldest of the Aeons and the first of the Archangels,
when about to hold communion with men, should dwell in theoldest and the
first of men, even Adam. And thus, when renovating those things which
were from the beginning, and forming them again of the Virgin by the
Spirit, He frames the
same<sup>[11](footnote/fn49.htm#P4979_1502093.md)</sup> just as at the
beginning. When the earth was still virgin and untilled, God, taking
mould, formed the reasonable creature from it without
seed.<sup>[12](footnote/fn49.htm#P4980_1502255.md)</sup>

And here I may adduce the prophet Jeremiah as a trustworthy and lucid
witness, who speaks thus: "Then I went down to the potter's house; and,
behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And the vessel that he made of
clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another
vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make
it."<sup>[13](footnote/fn49.htm#P4984_1502821.md)</sup> For when Adam,
having been formed out of clay, was still soft and moist, and not yet,
like a tile, made hard and incorruptible, sin ruined him, flowing and
dropping down upon him like water. And therefore God, moistening him
afresh and forming anew the same clay to His honour, having first
hardened and fixed it in the Virgin's womb, and united and mixed it with
the Word, brought it forth into life no longer soft and broken; lest,
being overflowed again by streams of corruption from without, it should
become soft, and perish as the Lord in His teaching shows in the parable
of the finding of the sheep; where my Lord says to those standing by,
"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth
not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which
is lost until he find it? and when he hath found it, he layeth it on his
shoulders rejoicing; and when he cometh home, he calleth together his
friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have
found my sheep which was lost."

Now, since He truly was and is, being in the beginning with God, and
being God,<sup>[14](footnote/fn49.htm#P4988_1504111.md)</sup> He is the
chief Commander and Shepherd of the heavenly ones, whom all reasonable
creatures obey and attend, who tends in order and numbers the multitudes
of the blessed angels. For this is the equal and perfect number of
immortal creatures, divided according to their races and tribes, man
also being here taken into the flock. For be also was created without
corruption, that he might honour the king and maker of all things,
responding to the shouts of the melodious angels which came from heaven.
But when it came to pass that, by transgressing the commandment (of
God), he suffered a terrible and destructive fall, being thus reduced to
a state of death, for this reason the Lord says that He came from heaven
into (a human) life, leaving the ranks and the armies of angels. For the
mountains are to be explained by the heavens, and the ninety and nine
sheep by the principalities and
powers<sup>[15](footnote/fn49.htm#P4989_1505027.md)</sup> which the Captain
and Shepherd left when He went down to seek the lost one. For it
remained that man should be included in this catalogue and number, the
Lord lifting him up and wrapping him round, that he might not again, as
I said, be overflowed and swallowed up by the waves of deceit. For with
this purpose the Word assumed the nature of man, that, having overcome
the serpent, He might by Himself destroy the condemnation which had come
into being along with man's ruin. For it was fitting that the Evil One
should be overcome by no other, but by him whom he had deceived, and
whom he was boasting that he held in subjection, because no otherwise
was it possible that sin and condemnation should be destroyed, unless
that same man on whose account it had been said, "Dust thou art, and
unto dust thou shall
return,"<sup>[16](footnote/fn49.htm#P4990_1505875.md)</sup> should be
created anew, and undo the sentence which for his sake had gone forth on
all, that "as in Adam" at first "all die, even so" again "in Christ,"
who assumed the *nature and position of* Adam, should "all be made
alive."<sup>[17](footnote/fn49.htm#P4991_1506120.md)</sup>

And now we seem to have said almost enough on the fact that man has
become the organ and clothing of the Only-begotten, and what He was who
came to dwell in him. But the fact that there is no *moral* inequality
or discord<sup>[18](footnote/fn49.htm#P4995_1506448.md)</sup> may again be
considered briefly from the beginning. For he speaks well who says that
that is in its own nature good and righteous and holy, by participation
of which other things become good, and that wisdom is in connection
with<sup>[19](footnote/fn49.htm#P4996_1506691.md)</sup> God, and that, on
the other hand, sin is unholy and unrighteous and evil. For life and
death, corruption and incorruption, are two things in the highest degree
opposed to each other. For life is a *moral* equality, but corruption an
inequality; and righteousness and prudence a harmony, but
unrighteousness and folly a discord. Now, man being between these is
neither righteousness itself, nor unrighteousness; but being placed
midway between incorruption and corruption, to whichever of these he may
incline is said to partake of the nature of that which has laid hold of
him. Now, when he inclines to corruption, he becomes corrupt and mortal,
and when to incorruption, he becomes incorrupt and immortal. For, being
placed midway between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, of the Fruit of which he
tasted,<sup>[20](footnote/fn49.htm#P4997_1507688.md)</sup> he was changed
into the nature of the latter, himself being neither the tree of life
nor that of corruption; but having been shown forth as mortal, from his
participation in and presence with corruption, and, again, as incorrupt
and immortal by connection with and participation in life; as Paul also
taught, saying, "Corruption shall not inherit incorruption, nor death
life,"<sup>[21](footnote/fn49.htm#P4998_1508083.md)</sup> rightly defining
corruption and death to be that which corrupts and kills, and not that
which is corrupted and dies; and incorruption and life that which gives
life and immortality, and not that which receives life and immortality.
And thus man is neither a discord and an inequality, nor an equality and
a harmony. But when he received discord, which is transgression and sin,
he became discordant and unseemly; but when he received harmony, that is
righteousness, he became a harmonious and seemly organ, in order that
the Lord, the Incorruption which conquered death, might harmonize the
resurrection with the flesh, not suffering it again to be inherited by
corruption. And on this point also let these statements suffice.

For it has been already established by no contemptible arguments from
Scripture, that the first man may be properly referred to Christ
Himself, and is no longer a type and representation and image of the
Only-begotten, but has become actually Wisdom and the Word.

For man, having been composed, like water, of wisdom and life, has
become identical with the very same untainted light which poured into
him. Whence it was that the apostle directly referred to Christ the
words which had been spoken of Adam. For thus will it be most certainly
agreed that the Church is formed out of His bones and flesh; and it was
for this cause that the Word, leaving His Father in heaven, came down to
be "joined to His wife; "<sup>[22](footnote/fn50.md)</sup> and slept in the
trance of His passion, and willingly suffered death for her, that He
might present the Church to Himself glorious and blameless, having
cleansed her by the
laver,<sup>[23](footnote/fn50.htm#P5004_1509975.md)</sup> for the receiving
of the spiritual and blessed seed, which is sown by Him who with
whispers implants it in the depths of the mind; and is conceived and
formed by the Church, as by a woman. so as to give birth and nourishment
to virtue. For in this way, too, the command, "Increase and
multiply,"<sup>[24](footnote/fn50.htm#P5005_1510292.md)</sup> is duly
fulfilled, the Church increasing daily in greatness and beauty and
multitude, by the union and communion of the Word who now still comes
down to us and falls into a trance by the memorial of His passion; for
otherwise the Church could not conceive believers, and give them new
birth by the laver of regeneration, unless Christ, emptying Himself for
their sake, that He might be contained by them, as I said, through the
recapitulation of His passion, should die again, coming down from
heaven, and being "joined to His wife," the Church, should provide for a
certain power being taken from His own side, so that all who are built
up in Him should grow up, even those who are born again by the laver,
receiving of His bones and of His flesh, that is, of His holiness and of
His glory. For he who says that the bones and flesh of Wisdom are
understanding and virtue, says most rightly; and that the
side<sup>[25](footnote/fn50.htm#P5006_1511220.md)</sup> is the Spirit of
truth, the Paraclete, of whom the
illuminated<sup>[26](footnote/fn50.htm#P5007_1511293.md)</sup> receiving
are fitly born again to incorruption. For it is impossible for any one
to be a partaker of the Holy Spirit, and to be chosen a member of
Christ, unless the Word first came down upon him and fell into a trance,
in order that he, being
filled<sup>[27](footnote/fn50.htm#P5008_1511708.md)</sup> with the Spirit,
and rising again from sleep with Him who was laid to sleep for his sake,
should be able to receive renewal and restoration. For He may fitly be
called the side<sup>[28](footnote/fn50.htm#P5009_1511955.md)</sup> of the
Word, even the sevenfold Spirit of truth, according to the
prophet;<sup>[29](footnote/fn50.htm#P5010_1512040.md)</sup> of whom God
taking, in the trance of Christ, that is, after His incarnation and
passion, prepares a help-meet for
Him<sup>[30](footnote/fn50.htm#P5011_1512175.md)</sup> -I mean the souls
which are betrothed and given in marriage to Him. For it is frequently
the case that the Scriptures thus call the assembly and mass of
believers by the name of the Church, the more perfect in their progress
being led up to be the one person and body of the Church. For those who
are the better, and who embrace the truth more clearly, being delivered
from the evils of the flesh, become, on account of their perfect
purification and faith, a church and help-meet of Christ, betrothed and
given in marriage to Him as a virgin, according to the
apostle,<sup>[31](footnote/fn50.htm#P5012_1512763.md)</sup> so that
receiving the pure and genuine seed of His doctrine, they may co-operate
with Him, helping in preaching for the salvation of others. And those
who are still imperfect and beginning their lessons, are born to
salvation, and shaped, as by mothers, by those who are more perfect,
until they are brought forth and regenerated unto the greatness and
beauty of virtue; and so these, in their turn making progress, having
become a church, assist in labouring for the birth and nurture of other
children, accomplishing in the receptacle of the soul, as in a womb, the
blameless will of the Word.

Now we should consider the case of the renowned Paul, that when he was
not yet perfect in Christ, he was first born and suckled, Ananias
preaching to him, and renewing him in baptism, as the history in the
Acts relates. But when he was grown to a man, and was built up, then
being moulded to spiritual perfection, he was made the help-meet and
bride of the Word; and receiving and conceiving the seeds of life, he
who was before a child, becomes a church and a mother, himself labouring
in birth of those who, through him, believed in the Lord, until Christ
was formed and born in them also. For he says, "My little children, of
whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you;
"<sup>[32](footnote/fn50.htm#P5016_1514128.md)</sup> and again, "In Christ
Jesus I have begotten you through the
Gospel."<sup>[33](footnote/fn50.htm#P5017_1514215.md)</sup>

It is evident, then, that the statement respecting Eve and Adam is to be
referred to the Church and Christ. For this is truly a great mystery and
a supernatural, of which I, from my weakness and dulness, am unable to
speak, according to its worth and greatness. Nevertheless, let us
attempt it. It remains that I speak to you on what follows, and of its
signification.

Now Paul, when summoning all persons to sanctification and purity, in
this way referred that which had been spoken concerning the first man
and Eve in a secondary sense to Christ and the Church, in order to
silence the ignorant, now deprived of all excuse. For men who are
incontinent in consequence of the uncontrolled impulses of sensuality in
them, dare to force the Scriptures beyond their true meaning, so as to
twist into a defence of their incontinence the saying, "Increase and
multiply; "<sup>[34](footnote/fn50.htm#P5022_1515163.md)</sup> and the
other, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother;
"<sup>[35](footnote/fn50.htm#P5023_1515254.md)</sup> and they are not
ashamed to run counter to the Spirit, but, as though born for this
purpose, they kindle up the smouldering and lurking passion, fanning and
provoking it; and therefore he, cutting off very sharply these dishonest
follies and invented excuses, and having arrived at the subject of
instructing them how men should behave to their wives, showing that it
should be as Christ did to the Church, "who gave Himself for it, that He
might sanctify and cleanse it by the
washing<sup>[36](footnote/fn50.htm#P5024_1515758.md)</sup> of water by the
Word,"<sup>[37](footnote/fn50.htm#P5025_1515884.md)</sup> he referred back
to Genesis, mentioning the things spoken concerning the first man, and
explaining these things as bearing on the subject before him, that he
might take away occasion for the abuse of these passages from those who
taught the sensual gratification of the body, under the pretext of
begetting children.

For consider, O virgins, how
he,<sup>[38](footnote/fn50.htm#P5029_1516337.md)</sup> desiring with all
his might that believers in Christ should be chaste, endeavours by many
arguments to show them the dignity of chastity, as when he
says,<sup>[39](footnote/fn50.htm#P5030_1516503.md)</sup> Now, concerning
the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a
woman," thence showing already very clearly that it is good not to
touch<sup>[40](footnote/fn50.htm#P5031_1516720.md)</sup> a woman, laying it
down. and setting it forth unconditionally. But afterwards, being aware
of the weakness of the less continent, and their passion for
intercourse, he permitted those who are unable to govern the flesh to
use their own wives, rather than, shamefully transgressing, to give
themselves up to fornication. Then, after having given this permission,
he immediately added these
words,<sup>[41](footnote/fn50.htm#P5032_1517305.md)</sup> "that Satan tempt
you not for your incontinency; "which means, "if you, such as you are,
cannot, on account of the incontinence and softness of your bodies, be
perfectly continent, I will rather permit you to have intercourse with
your own wives, lest, professing perfect continence, ye be constantly
tempted by the evil one, and be inflamed with lust after other men's
wives."

Come, now, and let us examine more carefully the very words which are
before us, and observe that the apostle did not grant these things
unconditionally to all, but first laid down the reason on account of
which he was led to this. For, having set forth that "it is good for a
man not to touch a
woman,"<sup>[42](footnote/fn50.htm#P5037_1518091.md)</sup> he added
immediately, "Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his
own wife"<sup>[43](footnote/fn50.htm#P5038_1518238.md)</sup> -that is, "on
account of the fornication which would arise from your being unable to
restrain your voluptuousness "-and let every woman have her own husband.
Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also
the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power of her own body, but
the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own
body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it tie with
consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to
prayer;<sup>[44](footnote/fn50.htm#P5039_1518757.md)</sup> and come
together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. But I
speak this by permission, and not of
commandment."<sup>[45](footnote/fn50.htm#P5040_1518985.md)</sup> And this
is very carefully considered. "By permission" he says, showing that he
was giving counsel, "not of command; "for he receives *command*
respecting chastity and the not touching of a woman, but *permission*
respecting those who are unable, as I said, to chasten their appetites.
These things, then, he lays down concerning men and women who are
married to one spouse, or who shall hereafter be so; but we must now
examine carefully the apostle's language respecting men who have lost
their wives, and women who have lost their husbands, and what he
declares on this subject.

"I say therefore," he goes
on,<sup>[46](footnote/fn50.htm#P5042_1519615.md)</sup> "to the unmarried
and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they
cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
Here also he persisted in giving the preference to continence. For,
taking himself as a notable example, in order to stir them up to
emulation, he challenged his hearers to this state of life, teaching
that it was better that a man who had been bound to one wife should
henceforth remain single, as lie also
did.<sup>[47](footnote/fn50.htm#P5043_1520111.md)</sup> But if, on the
other hand, this should be a matter of difficulty to any one, on account
of the strength of animal passion, he allows that one who is in such a
condition may, "by permission," contract a second marriage; not as
though he expressed the opinion that a second marriage was in itself
flood,<sup>[48](footnote/fn50.htm#P5044_1520519.md)</sup> but judging it
better than burning. Just as though, in the fast which prepares for the
Easter celebration, one should offer food to an other who was
dangerously ill, and say," In truth, my friend, it were fitting and good
that you should bravely hold out like us, and partake of the same
things,<sup>[49](footnote/fn50.htm#P5045_1520908.md)</sup> for it is
forbidden even to think of food to-day; but since you are held down and
weakened by disease, and cannot bear it, therefore, 'by permission, ' we
advise you to eat food, lest, being quite unable, from sickness, to hold
up against the desire for food, you perish." Thus also the apostle
speaks here, first saying that he wished all were healthy and continent,
as he also was, but afterwards allowing a second marriage to those who
are burdened with the disease of the passions, lest they should be
wholly defiled by fornication, goaded on by the itchings of the organs
of generation to promiscuous intercourse, considering such a second
marriage far preferable to burning and indecency.

I have now brought to an end what I have to say respecting continence
and marriage and chastity, and intercourse with men, and in which of
these there is help towards progress in righteousness; but it still
remains to speak concerning virginity-if, indeed, anything be prescribed
on this subject. Let us then treat this subject also; for it stands
thus:<sup>[50](footnote/fn50.htm#P5049_1522092.md)</sup> "Now concerning
virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as
one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I suppose
therefore that this is good for the present distress; I say, that it is
good for a man so to be. Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be
loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. But and if thou
marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned.
Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
Having given his opinion with great caution respecting virginity, and
being about to advise him who wished it to give his virgin in marriage,
so that none of those things which conduce to sanctification should be
of necessity and by compulsion, but according to the free purpose of the
soul. for this is acceptable to God, he does not wish these things to be
said as by authority, and as the mind of the Lord, with reference to the
giving of a virgin in marriage; for after he had
said,<sup>[51](footnote/fn50.htm#P5050_1523108.md)</sup> "if a virgin
marry, she hath not sinned," directly afterwards, with the greatest
caution, he modified his statement, showing that he had advised these
things by human permission, and not by divine. So, immediately after he
had said, "if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned," he added, "such
shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare
you."<sup>[52](footnote/fn50.htm#P5051_1523471.md)</sup> By which he means:
"I sparing you, such as you are, consented to these things, because yon
have chosen to think thus of them, that I may not seem to hurry you on
by violence, and compel any one to
this.<sup>[53](footnote/fn50.htm#P5052_1523695.md)</sup> But yet if it
shall please you who find chastity hard to bear, rather to turn to
marriage; I consider it to be profitable for you to restrain yourselves
in the gratification of the flesh, not making your marriage an occasion
for abusing your own vessels to uncleanness." Then he
adds,<sup>[54](footnote/fn50.htm#P5053_1524004.md)</sup> "But this I say,
brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have
wives be as though they had none." And again, going on and challenging
them to the same things, he confirmed his statement, powerfully
supporting the state of virginity, and adding expressly the following
words to those which he had spoken before, he
exclaimed,<sup>[55](footnote/fn50.htm#P5054_1524682.md)</sup> "I would have
you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that
belong to the Lord:<sup>[56](footnote/fn50.htm#P5055_1524813.md)</sup> but
he that is married careth for f the things that are of the world, how he
may please his wife. There is a difference also between a wife and a
virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she
may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth
for the things of the world, how she may please her husband." Now it is
clear to all, without any doubt, that to care for the things of the Lord
and to please God, is much better than to care for the things of the
world and to please one's wife. For who is there so foolish and blind.
as not to perceive in this statement the higher praise which Paul
accords to chastity? "And this," he
says,<sup>[57](footnote/fn50.htm#P5056_1525538.md)</sup> "I speak for your
own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is
comely."

Consider besides how, in addition to the words already quoted, he
commends the state of virginity as a gift of God. Wherefore he rejects
those of the more incontinent, who, under the influence of vain-glory,
would advance to this state, advising them to marry, lest in their time
of manly strength, the flesh stirring up the desires and passions, they
should be goaded on to defile the soul. For let us consider what he lays
down:<sup>[58](footnote/fn50.htm#P5060_1526187.md)</sup> " But if any man
think that he behaveth himself uncomely towards his virgin," he says,"
if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what
he will, he sinneth not: let him marry; "properly here preferring
marriage to "uncomeliness," in the case of those who had chosen the
state of virginity, but afterwards finding it intolerable and grievous,
and in word boasting of their perseverance before men, out of shame, but
indeed no longer having the power to persevere in the life of a eunuch.
But for him who of his own free will and purpose decides to preserve his
flesh in virgin purity, "having no
necessity,"<sup>[59](footnote/fn50.htm#P5061_1526893.md)</sup> that is,
passion calling forth his loins to intercourse, for there are, as it
seems, differences in men's bodies; such a one contending and
struggling, and zealously abiding by his profession. and admirably
fulfilling it, he exhorts to abide and to preserve it, according the
highest prize to virginity. For he that is able, he says, and ambitious
to preserve his flesh pure, does better; but he that is unable, and
enters into marriage lawfully, and does not indulge in secret
corruption, does well. And now enough has been said on these subjects.

Let any one who will, take in his hand the Epistle to the Corinthians,
and, examining all its passages one by one, then consider what we have
said, comparing them together, as to whether there is not a perfect
harmony and agreement between them. These things, according to my power,
O Arete, I offer to thee as my contribution on the subject of chastity.

Euboulios. Through many things, O Gregorion, she has scarcely come to
the subject, having measured and crossed a mighty sea of words.

Gregorion. So it seems; but come, I must mention the rest of what was
said in order, going through it and repeating it, while I seem to have
the sound of it dwelling in my ears, before it flies away and escapes;
for the remembrance of things lately heard is easily effaced from the
aged.

Euboulios. Say on, then; for we have come to have the pleasure of
hearing these discourses.

Gregorion. And then after, as you observed, Thaleia had descended from
her smooth and unbroken course to the earth, Theopatra, she said,
followed her in order, and spoke as follows.

Discourse IV.-Theopatra.

If the art of speaking, O virgins, always went by the same ways, and
passed along the same path, there would be no way to avoid wearying you
for one who persisted in the arguments which had already been urged. But
since there are of arguments myriads of currents and ways, God inspiring
us "at sundry times and in divers
manners,"<sup>[60](footnote/fn50.htm#P5072_1528938.md)</sup> who can have
the choice of holding back or of being afraid? For he would not be free
from blame to whom the gift has been given, if he failed to adorn that
which is honourable with words of praise. Come then, we also, according
to our gifts, will sing the brightest and most glorious star of Christ,
which is chastity. For this way of the Spirit is very wide and large.
Beginning, therefore, at the point from which we may say those things
which are suitable and fitting to the subject before us, I let us from
thence consider it.

Now I at least seem to perceive that nothing has been such a means of
restoring men to paradise, and of the change to incorruption, and of
reconciliation to God, and such a means of salvation to men, by guiding
us to life, as chastity. And I will now endeavour to show why I think so
concerning these things, that having heard distinctly the power of the
grace already spoken of, you may know of how great blessings it has
become the giver to us. Anciently, then, after the fall of man, when he
was cast out by reason of his transgression, the stream of corruption
poured forth abundantly, and running along in violent currents, not only
fiercely swept along whatever touched it from without, but also rushing
within it, overwhelmed the souls of men. And
they,<sup>[61](footnote/fn50.htm#P5076_1530394.md)</sup> continuously
exposed to this, were carried along dumb and stupid, neglecting to pilot
their vessels,<sup>[62](footnote/fn50.htm#P5077_1530518.md)</sup> from
having nothing firm to lay hold of. For the senses of the soul, as those
have said who are learned in these things, when, being overcome by the
excitements to passion which fall upon them from without, they receive
the sudden bursts of the waves of folly which rush into them, being
darkened turn aside from the divine course its whole vessel, which is by
nature easily guided. Wherefore God, pitying us who were in such a
condition, and were able neither to stand nor to rise, sent down from
heaven the best and most glorious help, virginity, that by it we might
tie our bodies fast, like ships, and have a calm, coming to an anchorage
without damage, as also the Holy Spirit witnesses. For this is said in
the hundred and
thirty-sixth<sup>[63](footnote/fn50.htm#P5078_1531275.md)</sup> psalm,
where the souls send joyfully up to God a hymn of
thanksgiving,<sup>[64](footnote/fn50.htm#P5079_1531571.md)</sup> as many as
have been taken hold of and raised up to walk with Christ in heaven,
that they might not be overwhelmed by the streams of the world and the
flesh. Whence, also, they say that Pharaoh was a type of the devil in
Egypt, since he mercilessly commanded the males to be cast into the
river,<sup>[65](footnote/fn50.htm#P5080_1531894.md)</sup> but the females
to be preserved alive. For the devil,
ruling<sup>[66](footnote/fn50.htm#P5081_1531973.md)</sup> from Adam to
Moses over this great Egypt, the world, took care to have the male and
rational offspring of the soul carried away and destroyed by the streams
of passions, but he longs for the carnal and irrational offspring to
increase and multiply.

But not to pass away from our subject, come, let us take in our hands
and examine this psalm, which the pure and stainless souls sing to God,
saying:<sup>[68](footnote/fn50.htm#P5086_1532615.md)</sup> "By the rivers
of Babylon there we sat down; yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We
hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof," clearly giving
the name of harps to their bodies which they hung upon the branches of
chastity, fastening them to the wood that they might not be snatched
away and dragged along again by the stream of incontinence. For Babylon,
which is interpreted "disturbance "or" confusion," signifies this life
around which the water flows, while we sit in the midst of which the
water flows round us, as long as we are in the world, the rivers of evil
always beating upon us. Wherefore, also, we are always fearful, and we
groan and cry with weeping to God, that our harps may not be snatched
off by the waves of pleasure, and slip down from the tree of chastity.
For everywhere the divine writings take the willow as the type of
chastity, because, when its flower is steeped in water, if it be drunk,
it extinguishes whatever kindles sensual desires and passions within us,
until it entirely renders barren, and makes every inclination to the
begetting of children without effect, as also Homer indicated, for this
reason calling the willows destructive of
fruit.<sup>[69](footnote/fn50.htm#P5087_1533991.md)</sup> And in Isaiah the
righteous are said to "spring up as willows by the water
courses."<sup>[70](footnote/fn50.htm#P5088_1534097.md)</sup> Surely, then,
the shoot of virginity is raised to a great and glorious height, when
the righteous, and he to whom it is given to preserve it and to
cultivate it, bedewing it with wisdom, is watered by the gentlest
streams of Christ. For as it is the nature of this tree to bud and grow
through water, so it is the nature of virginity to blossom and grow to
maturity when enriched by words, so that one can hang his
body<sup>[71](footnote/fn50.htm#P5089_1534536.md)</sup> upon it.

If, then, the rivers of Babylon are the streams of voluptuousness, as
wise men say, which confuse and disturb the soul, then the willows must
be chastity, to which we may suspend and draw up the organs of lust
which overbalance and weigh down the mind, so that they may not be borne
down by the torrents of incontinence, and be drawn like worms to
impurity and corruption. For God has bestowed upon us virginity as a
most useful and a serviceable help towards incorruption, sending it as
an ally to those who are contending for and longing after Zion, as the
psalm shows, which is resplendent charity and the commandment respecting
it, for Zion is interpreted "The commandment of the
watchtower."<sup>[72](footnote/fn50.htm#P5093_1535441.md)</sup> Now, let us
here enumerate the points which follow. For why do the souls declare
that they were asked by those who led them captive to sing the Lord's
song in a strange land? Surely because the Gospel teaches a holy and
secret song, which sinners and adulterers sing to the Evil One. For they
insult the commandments, accomplishing the will of the spirits of evil,
and cast holy things to dogs, and pearls before
swine,<sup>[73](footnote/fn50.htm#P5094_1535912.md)</sup> in the same
manner as those of whom the prophet says with indignation, "They read
the law<sup>[74](footnote/fn50.htm#P5095_1536021.md)</sup> without;
"<sup>[75](footnote/fn50.htm#P5096_1536061.md)</sup> for the Jews were not
to read the law going forth out of the gates of Jerusalem or out of
their houses; and for this reason the prophet blames them strongly, and
cries that they were liable to condemnation, because, while they were
transgressing the commandments, and acting impiously towards God, they
were pretentiously reading the law, as if, forsooth, they were piously
observing its precepts; but they did not receive it in their souls,
holding it firmly with faith, but rejected it, denying it by their
works. And hence they sing the Lord's song in a strange land, explaining
the law by distorting and degrading it, expecting a sensual kingdom, and
setting their hopes on this alien world, which the Word says will pass
away,<sup>[76](footnote/fn50.htm#P5097_1536882.md)</sup> where those who
carry them captive entice them with pleasures, lying in wait to deceive
them.

Now, those who sing the Gospel to senseless people seem to sing the
Lord's song in a strange land, of which Christ is not the husbandman;
but those who have put on and shone in the most pure and bright, and
unmingled and pious and becoming, ornament of virginity, and are found
barren and unproductive of unsettled and grievous passions, do not sing
the song in a strange land; because they are not borne thither by their
hopes, nor do they stick fast in the lusts of their mortal bodies, nor
do they take a low view of the meaning of the commandments, but well and
nobly, with a lofty disposition, they have regard to the promises which
are above, thirsting for heaven as a congenial abode, whence God,
approving their dispositions, promises with an oath to give them choice
honours, appointing and establishing them "above His chief joy; "for He
says thus:<sup>[77](footnote/fn51.htm#P5101_1537948.md)</sup> "If I forget
thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not
remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer
not Jerusalem above my chief joy; "meaning by Jerusalem, as I said,
these very undefiled and incorrupt souls, which, having with self-denial
drawn in the pure draught of virginity with unpolluted lips, are
"espoused to one husband," to be presented "as a chaste virgin to
Christ"<sup>[78](footnote/fn51.htm#P5102_1538408.md)</sup> in heaven,
"having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled
rewards."<sup>[79](footnote/fn51.htm#P5103_1538499.md)</sup> Hence also the
prophet Isaiah proclaims,
saying,<sup>[80](footnote/fn51.htm#P5104_1538566.md)</sup> "Arise,
shine,<sup>[81](footnote/fn51.htm#P5105_1538598.md)</sup> for thy light is
come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee." Now these promises,
it is evident to every one, will be fulfilled after the
resurrection.<sup>[82](footnote/fn51.htm#P5106_1538776.md)</sup> For the
Holy Spirit does not speak of that well-known town in Judea; but truly
of that heavenly city, the blessed Jerusalem, which He declares to be
the assembly of the souls which God plainly promises to place first,
"above His chief joy," in the new dispensation, settling those who are
clothed in the most white robe of virginity in the pure dwelling of
unapproachable light; because they had it not in mind to put off their
wedding garment-that is, to relax their minds by wandering thoughts.

Further, the expression in
Jeremiah,<sup>[83](footnote/fn51.htm#P5110_1539668.md)</sup> "That a maid
should not forget her ornaments, nor a bride her
attire,"<sup>[84](footnote/fn51.htm#P5111_1539943.md)</sup> shows that she
should not give up or loosen the band of chastity through wiles and
distractions. For by the heart are properly denoted our heart and mind.
Now the breastband, the girdle which gathers together and keeps firm the
purpose of the soul to chastity, is love to God, which our Captain and
Shepherd, Jesus, who is also our Ruler and Bridegroom, O illustrious
virgins, commands both you and me to hold fast unbroken and sealed up
even to the end; for one will not easily find anything else a greater
help to men than this possession, pleasing and grateful to God.
There-fore, I say, that we should all exercise and honour chastity, and
always cultivate and commend it.

Let these first-fruits of my discourse suffice for thee, O Arete, in
proof of my education and my zeal. "And I receive the gift," she said
that Arete replied, "and bid Thallousa speak after thee; for I must have
a discourse from each one of you." And she said that Thallousa, pausing
a little, as though considering somewhat with herself, thus spoke.
