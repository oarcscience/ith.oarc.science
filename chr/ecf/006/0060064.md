##  TRANSLATOR'S BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.

\[a.d. 260. I can add nothing but conjectures to the following: \] Of
this Theognostus we have no account by either Eusebius or Jerome.
Athanasius, however, mentions him more than once with honour. Thus he
speaks of him as a0nh r lo/gioj, an *eloquent* or learned
man.<sup>[1](footnote/fn27.htm#P2765_736264.md)</sup> And again as
Qeo/gnwstoj o9 qauma/sioj kai spoudai=oj, the admirable and zealous
Theognostus.<sup>[2](footnote/fn27.htm#P2766_736429.md)</sup> He seems to
have belonged to the Catechetical school of Alexandria, and to have
flourished there in the latter half of the third century, probably about
a.d. 260. That he was a disciple of Origen, or at least a devoted
student of his works, is clear from
Photius.<sup>[3](footnote/fn27.htm#P2767_736718.md)</sup> He wrote a work
in seven books, the title of which is thus given by
Photius:<sup>[4](footnote/fn27.htm#P2768_736918.md)</sup> The Outlines of
the blessed Theognostus, the exegete of Alexandria. Dodwell and others
are of opinion that by this term
exegete,<sup>[5](footnote/fn27.htm#P2769_737317.md)</sup> is meant the
presidency of the Catechetical school and the privilege of public
teaching; and that the title, Outlines, was taken from Clement, his
predecessor in office. According to Photius, the work was on this plan.
The first book treated of God the Father, as the maker of the universe;
the second, of the necessary existence of the Son; the third, of the
Holy Spirit; the fourth, of angels and demons; the fifth and sixth, of
the incarnation of God; while the seventh bore the title, *On God's
Creation*. Photius has much to say in condemnation of Thegnostus, who,
however, has been vindicated by Bull and Prudentius Maranus. Gregory of
Nyssa has also charged him with holding the same error as Eunomius on
the subject of the Son's relation to the work of creation. He is
adduced, however, by Athanasius as a defender of the Homousian doctrine.
