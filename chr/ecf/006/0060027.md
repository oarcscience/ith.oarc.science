##  Elucidations.

I Can do no better than follow Dupin as to the authorship of these
Homilies. He thinks the style of Proclus (of Constantinople) may be
detected in them, though the fourth is beyond him for eloquence, and has
even been thought worthy of St. Chrysostom. It was produced after
Nicaea, and probably after Ephesus, its somewhat exaggerated praises of
the qeoto/ko being unusual at an earlier period. The titles of these
Homilies are the work of much later editors; and interpolations probably
occur frequently, by the same hands.
