##  Book VI.

------------

1\. Having shown briefly how impious and infamous *are the* opinions
*which* you have formed about your gods, we have now
to<sup>[1](footnote/fn80.md)</sup> speak of their temples, their images
also, and sacrifices, and of the other things which
are<sup>[2](footnote/fn80.htm#P8051_2535654.md)</sup> nailed and closely
related to them. For you are here in the habit of fastening upon us a
very serious charge of impiety because we do not rear temples for the
ceremonies of worship, do not set up statues and
images<sup>[3](footnote/fn80.htm#P8052_2535902.md)</sup> of any god, do not
build altars,<sup>[4](footnote/fn80.htm#P8053_2535998.md)</sup> do not
offer the blood of creatures slain in *sacrifices,
incense*,<sup>[5](footnote/fn80.htm#P8054_2536167.md)</sup> nor sacrificial
meal, and finally, do not bring wine flowing in libations from sacred
bowls; which, indeed, we neglect to build and do, not as though we
cherish impious and wicked dispositions, or have conceived any madly
desperate feeling of contempt for the gods, but because we think and
believe that they<sup>[6](footnote/fn80.htm#P8055_2536605.md)</sup> -if
only they are true gods, and are called by this exalted
name<sup>[7](footnote/fn80.htm#P8056_2536736.md)</sup> -either scorn such
honours, if they give way to scorn, or endure *them* with anger, if they
are roused by feelings of rage.

2\. For-that you may learn what are our sentiments and opinions about
that race-we think that they-if only they are true gods. that the same
things may be said again till you are wearied hearing
them<sup>[8](footnote/fn80.htm#P8058_2537107.md)</sup> -should have all the
virtues in perfection, should be wise, upright. venerable,-if only our
heaping upon them human honours is not a crime,-strong in excellences
within themselves, and should not give
themselves<sup>[9](footnote/fn80.htm#P8059_2537347.md)</sup> up to external
props, because the completeness of their unbroken bliss is made perfect;
*should be* free from all agitating and disturbing passions; should not
burn with anger, should not he excited by any desires; should send
misfortune to none, should not find a cruel pleasure in the ills of men;
should not terrify by portents, should not show prodigies to cause fear;
should not hold *men* responsible and liable to be punished for the vows
which they owe, nor demand expiatory sacrifices by threatening omens;
should not bring on pestilences and diseases by corrupting the air,
should not burn up the fruits with droughts; should take no part in the
slaughter of war and devastation of cities; should not wish ill to one
party, and be favourable to the success of another; but, as becomes
great minds, should weigh all in a just balance, and show kindness
impartially to all. For it belongs to a mortal race and human weakness
to act otherwise;<sup>[10](footnote/fn80.htm#P8060_2538349.md)</sup> and
the maxims and declarations of wise men state distinctly, that those who
are touched by passion live a life of
suffering,<sup>[11](footnote/fn80.htm#P8061_2538810.md)</sup> *and* are
weakened by grief,<sup>[12](footnote/fn80.htm#P8062_2538880.md)</sup> and
that it cannot be but that those who have been given over to disquieting
feelings, have been bound by the laws of mortality. Now, since this is
the case, how can we be supposed to hold the gods in contempt, who we
say are not gods, and cannot be connected with the powers of heaven,
unless they are just and worthy of the admiration which great minds
excite?

3\. But, *we are told*, we rear no temples to them, and do not worship
their images; we do not slay victims in sacrifice, we do not offer
incense<sup>[13](footnote/fn80.htm#P8064_2539558.md)</sup> and libations of
wine. And what greater honour or dignity can we ascribe to them, than
that we put them in the same position as the Head and Lord of the
universe, to whom the gods owe it in common with
us,<sup>[14](footnote/fn80.htm#P8065_2539801.md)</sup> that they are
conscious that they exist, and have a living
being?<sup>[15](footnote/fn80.htm#P8066_2540070.md)</sup> For do we honour
Him with shrines, and by building
temples?<sup>[16](footnote/fn80.htm#P8067_2540177.md)</sup> Do we even slay
victims *to Him*? Do we give *Him* the other things, to take which and
pour them forth in libation shows not a careful regard to reason, but
heed to a practice
maintained<sup>[17](footnote/fn80.htm#P8068_2541025.md)</sup> *merely* by
usage? For it is perfect folly to measure greater powers by your
necessities, and to give the things useful to yourself to the gods who
give *all things*, and to think this an honour, not an insult. We ask,
therefore, to do what service to the gods, or to meet what want, do you
say that temples have been
reared,<sup>[18](footnote/fn80.htm#P8069_2541371.md)</sup> and think that
they should be again built? Do they feel the cold
of<sup>[19](footnote/fn80.htm#P8070_2541518.md)</sup> winter, or are they
scorched by summer suns? Do storms of rain flow over them, or whirlwinds
shake them? Are they in danger of being exposed to the onset of enemies,
or the furious attacks of wild beasts, so that it is right and becoming
to shut them up in places of
security,<sup>[20](footnote/fn80.htm#P8071_2541900.md)</sup> or guard them
by throwing up a rampart of stones? For what are these temples? If you
ask human weakness<sup>[21](footnote/fn80.htm#P8072_2542046.md)</sup>
-something vast and spacious; if you consider the power of the
gods-small caves, as it
were,<sup>[22](footnote/fn80.htm#P8073_2542237.md)</sup> and even, to speak
more truly, the narrowest kind of caverns formed and contrived with
sorry, judgment.<sup>[23](footnote/fn80.htm#P8074_2542360.md)</sup> Now, if
you ask to be told who was their first
founder<sup>[24](footnote/fn80.htm#P8075_2542467.md)</sup> and builder,
either Phoroneus or the Egyptian
Merops<sup>[25](footnote/fn80.htm#P8076_2542583.md)</sup> will be mentioned
to you, or, as Varro relates in his *treatise* "*de Admirandis*," Aeacus
the offspring of Jupiter. Though these, then, should be built of heaps
of marble, or shine resplendent with ceilings fretted with gold, though
precious stones sparkle here, and gleam like stars set at varying
intervals, all these things are made up of earth, and of the lowest
dregs of even baser matter. For not even, if you value these more
highly, is it to be believed that the gods take pleasure in them, or
that they do not refuse and scorn to shut themselves up, and be confined
within these barriers. This, *my opponent says*, is the temple of Mars,
this *that* of Juno and of Venus, this *that* of Hercules, of Apollo, of
Dis. What is this but to say this is the house of Mars, this of Juno and
Venus,<sup>[26](footnote/fn80.htm#P8077_2543654.md)</sup> Apollo dwells
here, in this abides Hercules, in that Summanus? Is it not, then, the
very<sup>[27](footnote/fn80.htm#P8078_2543894.md)</sup> greatest affront to
hold the gods kept fast<sup>[28](footnote/fn80.htm#P8079_2543963.md)</sup>
in habitations, to give to them little huts, to build lockfast places
and cells, and to think that the things
are<sup>[29](footnote/fn80.htm#P8080_2544145.md)</sup> necessary to them
which are needed by men, cats, emmets, and lizards, by quaking,
timorous, and little mice?

4\. But, says *my opponent*, it is not for this reason that we assign
temples to the gods as though we *wished to* ward off from them
drenching storms of rain, winds, showers, or the rays of the sun; but in
order that we may be able to see them in person and close at hand, to
come near and address them, and impart to them, when in a measure
present, the expressions of our reverent feelings. For if they are
invoked under the open heaven, and the canopy of ether, they hear
nothing, *I suppose*; and unless prayers are addressed to them near at
hand, they will stand deaf and immoveable as if nothing were said. And
yet we think that every god whatever-if only he has the power of this
name-should hear what every one said from every part of the world, just
as if he were present; nay, more, should foresee, without waiting to be
told<sup>[30](footnote/fn80.htm#P8082_2545130.md)</sup> what every one
conceived in his secret and
silent<sup>[31](footnote/fn80.htm#P8083_2545222.md)</sup> thoughts. And as
the stars, the sun, the moon, while they wander above the earth, are
steadily and everywhere in sight of all those who gaze at them without
any exception; so, too,<sup>[32](footnote/fn80.htm#P8084_2545502.md)</sup>
it is fitting that the ears of the gods should be closed against no
tongue, and should be ever within reach, although voices should flow
together to them from widely separated regions. For this *it is* that
belongs specially to the gods,-to fill all things with their power, to
be not partly at any place, but all everywhere, not to go to dine with
the Aethiopians, and return after twelve days to their own
dwellings.<sup>[33](footnote/fn80.htm#P8085_2546131.md)</sup>

5\. Now, if this be not the case, all hope of help is taken away, and it
will be doubtful whether you are
heard<sup>[34](footnote/fn80.htm#P8087_2546292.md)</sup> by the gods or
not, if ever you perform the sacred rites with due ceremonies. For, to
make it clear,<sup>[35](footnote/fn80.htm#P8088_2546564.md)</sup> let us
suppose that there is a temple of some deity in the Canary Islands,
*another* of the same *deity* in remotest Thyle, also among the Seres,
among the tawny Garamantes, and any
others<sup>[36](footnote/fn80.htm#P8089_2546807.md)</sup> who are debarred
from knowing each other by seas, mountains, forests, and the four
quarters of the world. If they all at one time beg of the deity with
sacrifices what their wants compel each one to think
about,<sup>[37](footnote/fn80.htm#P8090_2547057.md)</sup> what hope, pray,
will there be to all of obtaining the benefit, if the god does not hear
the cry sent up to him everywhere, and *if* there shall be any distance
to which the words of the suppliant for help cannot penetrate? For
either he will be nowhere present, if he may at times not be
anywhere,<sup>[38](footnote/fn80.htm#P8091_2547618.md)</sup> or he will be
at one place only, since he cannot give his attention generally, and
without making any distinction. And thus it is brought about, that
either the god helps none at all, if being busy with something he has
been unable to hasten to give ear to their cries, or one only goes away
with his prayers heard, *while* the rest have effected nothing.

6\. What *can you say* as to this, that it is attested by the writings
of authors, that many of these temples which have been raised with
golden domes and lofty roofs cover bones and ashes, and are sepulchres
of the dead? Is it not plain and manifest, either that you worship dead
men for immortal gods, or that an inexpiable affront is cast upon the
deities, whose shrines and temples have been built over the tombs of the
dead? Antiochus,<sup>[39](footnote/fn80.htm#P8093_2548641.md)</sup> in the
ninth *book* of his *Histories*, relates that Cecrops was buried in the
temple of Minerva,<sup>[40](footnote/fn80.htm#P8094_2548925.md)</sup> at
Athens; again, in the temple of the same goddess, which is in the
citadel of Larissa,<sup>[41](footnote/fn80.htm#P8095_2549040.md)</sup> it
is related and declared that Acrisius was laid, *and* in the sanctuary
of Polias,<sup>[42](footnote/fn80.htm#P8096_2549277.md)</sup> Erichthonius;
*while* the brothers Dairas and Immarnachus were *buried* in the
enclosure of Eleusin, which lies near the city. What say you as to the
virgin daughters of Coleus? are they not said to be
buried<sup>[43](footnote/fn80.htm#P8097_2549678.md)</sup> in the temple of
Ceres at Eleusin? *and* in the shrine of Diana, which was set up in the
temple of the Delian Apollo, are not Hyperoche and Laodice buried, who
are said to have been brought thither from the country of the
Hyperboreans? In the Milesian
Didymae,<sup>[44](footnote/fn80.htm#P8098_2550073.md)</sup> Leandrius says
that Cleochus had the last honours of burial paid to him. Zeno of Myndus
openly relates that the monument of Leucophryne is in the sanctuary of
Diana at Maghesia. Under the altar of Apollo, which is seen in the city
of Telmessus, is it not invariably declared by writings that the prophet
Telmessus lies buried? Ptolemaeus, the son of Agesarchus, in the first
book of the *History of
Philopatar*<sup>[45](footnote/fn80.htm#P8099_2550584.md)</sup> which he
published, affirms, on the authority of literature, that Cinyras, king
of Paphos, was interred in the temple of Venus with all his family, nay,
more, with all his stock. It would be<sup>[46](footnote/fn81.md)</sup> an
endless and boundless task to describe in what sanctuaries they all are
throughout the world; nor is anxious care required,
although<sup>[47](footnote/fn81.htm#P8101_2551043.md)</sup> the Egyptians
fixed a penalty for any one who should have revealed the places in which
Apis lay hid, as to those
*Polyandria*<sup>[48](footnote/fn81.htm#P8102_2551571.md)</sup> of
Varro,<sup>[49](footnote/fn81.htm#P8103_2551818.md)</sup> by what temples
they are covered, and what heavy masses they have laid upon them.

7\. But why *do I speak* of these trifles? What man is there who is
ignorant that in the Capitol of the imperial people is the sepulchre of
Tolus<sup>[50](footnote/fn81.htm#P8105_2552061.md)</sup> Vulcentanus? Who
is there, I say, who does not know that from
beneath<sup>[51](footnote/fn81.htm#P8106_2552359.md)</sup> its foundations
there was rolled a man's head, buried for no very long time before,
either by itself without the other parts of the body,-for some relate
this,-or with all its members? Now, if you require this to be made clear
by the testimonies of authors, Sammonicus, Granius,
Valerianus,<sup>[52](footnote/fn81.htm#P8107_2552677.md)</sup> and Fabius
will declare to you whose son
Aulus<sup>[53](footnote/fn81.htm#P8108_2552844.md)</sup> was, of what race
and nation, how<sup>[54](footnote/fn81.htm#P8109_2553009.md)</sup> he was
bereft of life and light by the slave of his brother, of what crime he
was guilty against his fellow-citizens, that he was denied burial in his
father<sup>[55](footnote/fn81.htm#P8110_2553424.md)</sup> land. You will
learn also-although they pretend to be unwilling to make this
public-what was done with his head when cut off, or in what place it was
shut up, and the whole affair carefully concealed, in order that the
omen which the gods had attested might stand without
interruption,<sup>[56](footnote/fn81.htm#P8111_2553836.md)</sup>
unalterable, and sure. Now, while it was proper that this *story*,
should be suppressed, and concealed, and forgotten in the lapse of time,
the composition at the name published it, and, by a testimony which
could not be got rid of, caused it to remain *in men's minds*, together
with its causes, so long as it endured
itself;<sup>[57](footnote/fn81.htm#P8112_2554219.md)</sup> and the state
*which is* greatest *of all*, and worships all deities, did not blush in
giving a name to the temple, to name it from the head of
Olus<sup>[58](footnote/fn81.htm#P8113_2554412.md)</sup> Capitolium rather
than from the name of Jupiter.

8\. we have therefore-as I suppose-shown sufficiently, that to the
immortal gods temples have been either reared in vain, or built in
consequence of insulting opinions *held* to their dishonour and to the
belittling<sup>[59](footnote/fn81.htm#P8115_2554780.md)</sup> of the power
believed *to be in their hands*. We have next to say something about
statues and images, which you form with much skill, and tend with
religious care,-wherein if there is any credibility, we can by no amount
of consideration settle in our own minds whether you do this in earnest
and with a serious purpose, or amuse yourselves in childish dreams by
mocking at these very
things.<sup>[60](footnote/fn81.htm#P8116_2555324.md)</sup> For if you are
assured that the gods exist whom you suppose, and that they live in the
highest regions of heaven, what cause, what reason, is there that those
images should be fashioned by you, when you have true beings to whom you
may pour forth prayers, and *from whom you may*, ask help in trying
circumstances? But if, on the contrary, you do not believe, or, to speak
with moderation, are in doubt, in this case, also, what reason is there,
pray, to fashion and set up images of doubtful *beings*, and to
form<sup>[61](footnote/fn81.htm#P8117_2555878.md)</sup> with vain imitation
what you do not believe to exist? Do you perchance say, that under these
images of deities there is displayed to you their presence, as it were,
and that, because it has not been given you to see the gods, they are
worshipped in this
fashion,<sup>[62](footnote/fn81.htm#P8118_2556256.md)</sup> and the duties
owed *to them* paid? He who says and asserts this, does not believe that
the gods exist; and he is proved not to put faith in his own religion,
to whom it is necessary to see what he may hold, lest that which *being*
obscure is not seen, may happen to be vain.

9\. We worship the gods, you say, by means of
images.<sup>[63](footnote/fn81.htm#P8120_2556707.md)</sup> What then?
Without these, do the gods not know that they are worshipped, and will
they not think that any honour is shown to them by you? Through bypaths,
as it were, then, and by assignments to a third
party,<sup>[64](footnote/fn81.htm#P8121_2557015.md)</sup> as they are
called, they receive and accept your services; and before those to whom
that service is owed experience it, you first sacrifice to images, and
transmit, as it were, some remnants to them at the pleasure of
others.<sup>[65](footnote/fn81.htm#P8122_2557369.md)</sup> And what greater
wrong, disgrace, hardship, can be inflicted than to acknowledge one god,
and *yet* make supplication to something else-to hope for help from a
deity, and pray to an image without feeling? Is not this, I pray you,
that which is said in the common proverbs: "to cut down the smith when
you strike at the fuller;
"<sup>[66](footnote/fn81.htm#P8123_2557781.md)</sup> "and when you seek a
man's advice, to require of asses and pigs their opinions as to what
should be done? "

10\. And whence, finally, do you know whether all these images which you
form and put in the place
of<sup>[67](footnote/fn81.htm#P8125_2558078.md)</sup> the immortal gods
reproduce and bear a resemblance to the gods? For it may happen that in
heaven one has a beard who by you is
represented<sup>[68](footnote/fn81.htm#P8126_2558432.md)</sup> with smooth
cheeks; that *another* is rather advanced in years to whom you give the
appearance of a youth;<sup>[69](footnote/fn81.htm#P8127_2558692.md)</sup>
that here he is fair, *with blue
eyes*,<sup>[70](footnote/fn81.htm#P8128_2558754.md)</sup> who really has
grey ones; that he has distended nostrils whom you make and form with a
high nose. For it is not right to call or name that an image which does
not derive from the face of the original features like it;
which<sup>[71](footnote/fn81.htm#P8129_2559203.md)</sup> can be recognised
to be clear and certain from things which are manifest. For while all we
men see that the sun is perfectly round by our eyesight, which cannot be
doubted, you have given<sup>[72](footnote/fn81.htm#P8130_2559463.md)</sup>
to him the features of a man, and of mortal bodies. The moon is always
in motion, and in its restoration every month puts on thirty
faces:<sup>[73](footnote/fn81.htm#P8131_2559692.md)</sup> with you, as
leaders and designers, that is *represented* as a woman, and has one
countenance, which passes through a thousand different states, changing
each day.<sup>[74](footnote/fn81.htm#P8132_2560285.md)</sup> We understand
that all the winds are *only* a flow of air driven and impelled in
mundane ways in your hands they
take<sup>[75](footnote/fn81.htm#P8133_2560475.md)</sup> the forms of men
filling with breath twisted trumpets by blasts from out their
breasts.<sup>[76](footnote/fn81.htm#P8134_2560581.md)</sup> Among *the
representations of* your gods we see *that there is* the very stern face
of a lion<sup>[77](footnote/fn81.htm#P8135_2560708.md)</sup> smeared with
pure vermilion, and that it is named *Frugifer*. If all these images are
likenesses of the gods above, there must then be said to dwell in heaven
also a god such as the image which has been made to represent his form
and appearance;<sup>[78](footnote/fn81.htm#P8136_2561760.md)</sup> and, of
course, as here that *figure* of yours, so there the deity
himself<sup>[79](footnote/fn81.htm#P8137_2561932.md)</sup> is a mere mask
and face, without the rest of the body, growling with fiercely gaping
jaws, terrible, red as
blood,<sup>[80](footnote/fn81.htm#P8138_2562066.md)</sup> holding an apple
fast with his teeth, and at times, as dogs *do* when wearied, putting
his tongue out of his gaping
mouth.<sup>[81](footnote/fn81.htm#P8139_2562357.md)</sup> But
if,<sup>[82](footnote/fn81.htm#P8140_2562612.md)</sup> indeed, this is not
the case, as we all think that it is not, what, pray, is the meaning of
so great audacity to fashion to yourself whatever form you please, and
to say<sup>[83](footnote/fn81.htm#P8141_2562822.md)</sup> that it is an
image of a god whom you cannot prove to exist at all?

11\. You laugh because in ancient times the Persians worshipped rivers,
as is told in the writings which hand down *these things* to memory; the
Arabians an unshapen
stone;<sup>[84](footnote/fn81.htm#P8143_2563105.md)</sup> the Scythian
nations a sabre; the Thespians a branch instead of
Cinxia;<sup>[85](footnote/fn81.htm#P8144_2563962.md)</sup> the
Icarians<sup>[86](footnote/fn81.htm#P8145_2564029.md)</sup> an unhewn log
instead of Diana; the people of Pessinus a flint instead of the mother
of the gods; the Romans a spear instead of Mars, as the muses of Varro
point out; and, before they were acquainted with the statuary's art, the
Samians a plank<sup>[87](footnote/fn81.htm#P8146_2564459.md)</sup> instead
of Juno, as Aethlius<sup>[88](footnote/fn81.htm#P8147_2564615.md)</sup>
relates: and you do not laugh when, instead of the immortal gods, you
make supplication to little images of men and human forms-nay, you even
suppose that these very little images are gods, and besides these you do
not believe that anything has divine power. What say you, O ye-! Do the
gods of heaven have ears, then, and temples, an occiput, spine, loins,
sides, hams, buttocks,
houghs,<sup>[89](footnote/fn81.htm#P8148_2565069.md)</sup> ankles, and the
rest of the other members with which we have been formed, which were
also mentioned in the first part *of this
book*<sup>[90](footnote/fn81.htm#P8149_2565301.md)</sup> a little more
fully, and cited with greater copiousness of language? Would that it
were possible<sup>[91](footnote/fn81.htm#P8150_2565427.md)</sup> to look
into the sentiments and very recesses of your mind, in which yon revolve
various and enter into the most obscure considerations: we should find
that you yourselves even feel as we do, and have no other opinions as to
the form of the deities. But what can we do with obstinate prejudices?
what with those who are menacing *us* with swords, and devising new
punishments against us? In your
rage<sup>[92](footnote/fn81.htm#P8151_2565855.md)</sup> you maintain a bad
cause, *and that although you are* perfectly aware *of it*; and that
which you have once done without reason, you defend lest you should seem
to have ever been in ignorance; and you think it better not to be
conquered, than to yield and bow to acknowledged truth.

12\. From such causes as these this also has followed, with your
connivance, that the wanton fancy of artists has found full scope in
*representing* the bodies of the gods, and giving forms to them, at
which even the sternest might laugh. And so Hammon is even now formed
and represented with a ram's horns; Saturn with his crooked sickle, like
some guardian of the fields, *and* pruner of too luxuriant branches; the
son of Maia with a broad-brimmed travelling cap, as if he were preparing
to take the road, and avoiding the sun's rays and the dust; Liber with
tender limbs, and with a woman's perfectly free and easily flowing lines
of body<sup>[93](footnote/fn81.htm#P8153_2566891.md)</sup> Venus, naked and
unclothed, just as if you said that she exposed publicly, and sold to
all comers,<sup>[94](footnote/fn81.htm#P8154_2567061.md)</sup> the beauty
of her prostituted body; Vulcan with his cap and hammer, but with his
right hand free, and with his dress girt up as a workman
prepares<sup>[95](footnote/fn81.htm#P8155_2567224.md)</sup> for his work;
the Delian god with a plectrum and lyre, gesticulating like a player on
the cithern and an actor about to sing; the king of the sea with his
trident, just as if he had to fight in the gladiatorial contest: nor can
any figure of any deity be
found<sup>[96](footnote/fn81.htm#P8156_2567526.md)</sup> which does not
have certain
characteristics<sup>[97](footnote/fn81.htm#P8157_2567612.md)</sup> bestowed
*on it* by the generosity of its makers. Lo, if some witty and cunning
king were to remove the Sun from *his place before* the
gate<sup>[98](footnote/fn81.htm#P8158_2567763.md)</sup> and transfer him to
that of Mercury, and again were to carry off Mercury and make him
migrate to the shrine of the Sun.-for both are made beardless by you,
and with smooth faces.-and to give to this one rays *of light* to place
a little cap<sup>[99](footnote/fn81.htm#P8159_2568147.md)</sup> on the
Sun's head, how will you be able to distinguish between them, whether
this is the Sun, or that Mercury, since dress, not the peculiar
appearance of the face, usually points out the gods to you? Again, if,
having transported them in like manner, he were to take away Iris horns
from the unclad Jupiter, and fix them upon the temples of Mars. and to
strip Mars of his arms, and, on the other hand, invest Hammon with them,
what distinction can there be between them, since he who had been
Jupiter can be also supposed to be Mars, and he who had been Mayors can
assume the appearance of Jupiter Hammon? To such an extent is there
wantonness in fashioning those images and consecrating names, as if they
*were* peculiar to them; since, if you take away their dress, the *means
of* recognising each is put an end to, god may be believed to be god,
one may seem to be the other, nay, more, both may be considered both!

13\. But why do I laugh at the sickles and tridents which have been
given to the gods? why at the horns, hammers, and caps, when I know that
certain images have<sup>[100](footnote/fn81.htm#P8161_2569281.md)</sup> the
forms of certain men, and the features of notorious courtesans? For who
is there that does not know that the Athenians formed the Hermae in the
likeness of Alcibiades? Who does not know-if he read Posidippus over
again-that Praxiteles, putting forth his utmost
skill,<sup>[101](footnote/fn81.htm#P8162_2569573.md)</sup> fashioned the
face of the Cnidian Venus on the model of the courtesan Gratina, whom
the unhappy man loved desperately? Blot is this the only Venus to whom
there has been given beauty taken from a harlot's face?
Phryne.<sup>[102](footnote/fn81.htm#P8163_2569830.md)</sup> the well-known
native of Thespia-as those who have written *on* Thespian affairs
relate-when she was at the height of her beauty. comeliness, and
youthful vigour, is said to have ben the model of all the Venuses which
are *held* in esteem, whether throughout the cities of Greece or
here,<sup>[103](footnote/fn81.htm#P8164_2570205.md)</sup> whither has
flowed the longing and eager desire for such figures. All the artists,
therefore, who lived at that time, and to whom truth gave the greatest
ability to portray likenesses, vied in transferring with all painstaking
and zeal the outline of a prostitute to the images of the Cytherean. The
beautiful *thoughts*<sup>[104](footnote/fn81.htm#P8165_2570597.md)</sup> of
the artists were full of fire; and they strove each to excel the other
with emulous rivalry, not that Venus might become more august, but that
Phryne<sup>[105](footnote/fn81.htm#P8166_2570999.md)</sup> might stand for
Venus. And so it was brought to this, that sacred honours were offered
to courtesans instead of the immortal gods, and an unhappy system of
worship was led astray by the making of
statues.<sup>[106](footnote/fn81.htm#P8167_2571234.md)</sup> That
well-known and<sup>[107](footnote/fn81.htm#P8168_2571395.md)</sup> most
distinguished statuary, Phidias, when he had raised the form of Olympian
Jupiter with immense labour and
exertion,<sup>[108](footnote/fn81.htm#P8169_2571572.md)</sup> inscribed on
the finger of the god
Pantarces<sup>[109](footnote/fn81.htm#P8170_2571667.md)</sup> *is*
Beautiful,-*this*, moreover, was the name of a boy loved by him, and
that with lewd desire,-and was not moved by any fear or religious dread
to call the god by the name of a prostitute; nay, rather, to consecrate
the divinity and image of Jupiter to a debauchee. To such an extent is
there wantonness and childish feeling in forming those little images,
adoring them as gods, heaping upon them the divine virtues, when we see
that the artists themselves find amusement in fashioning them, and set
them up as monuments of their own lusts! For what *reason* is there, if
you should inquire, why Phidias should hesitate to amuse himself, and be
wanton when he knew that, but a little before, the very Jupiter *which
he had* made was gold, stones, and
ivory,<sup>[110](footnote/fn81.htm#P8171_2572814.md)</sup> formless,
separated, confused, and that it was he himself who brought all these
together and bound them fast, that their
appearance<sup>[111](footnote/fn81.htm#P8172_2572968.md)</sup> had been
given to them by himself in the
imitation<sup>[112](footnote/fn81.htm#P8173_2573055.md)</sup> of limbs
which he had carved; and, which is more
than<sup>[113](footnote/fn81.htm#P8174_2573136.md)</sup> all, that it was
his own free gift, that *Jupiter* had been produced and was adored among
men?<sup>[114](footnote/fn81.htm#P8175_2573257.md)</sup>

14\. We would here, as if all nations on the earth were present, make
one speech, and pour into the ears of them all, words which should be
heard in common:<sup>[115](footnote/fn81.htm#P8177_2573442.md)</sup> Why,
pray, is this, O men! that of your own accord you cheat and deceive
yourselves by voluntary blindness? Dispel the darkness now, and,
returning to the light of the mind, look more closely and see what that
is which is going on, if only you retain your
right,<sup>[116](footnote/fn81.htm#P8178_2573753.md)</sup> and are not
beyond the reach<sup>[117](footnote/fn81.htm#P8179_2573848.md)</sup> of the
reason and prudence given to
you.<sup>[118](footnote/fn81.htm#P8180_2573926.md)</sup> Those images which
fill you with terror, and which you adore prostrate upon the
ground<sup>[119](footnote/fn81.htm#P8181_2574112.md)</sup> in all the
temples, are bones, stones, brass, silver, gold, clay, wood taken from a
tree, or glue mixed with gypsum. Having been heaped together, it may be,
from a harlot's gauds or from a
woman's<sup>[120](footnote/fn81.htm#P8182_2574336.md)</sup> ornaments, from
camels' bones or from the tooth of the Indian
beast,<sup>[121](footnote/fn81.htm#P8183_2574439.md)</sup> from
cooking-pots and little jars, from candlesticks and lamps, or from other
less cleanly vessels, *and* having been melted down, they were cast into
these shapes and came out into the forms which you see, baked in
potters' furnaces, produced by anvils and hammers, scraped with the
silversmith's, and filed down with *ordinary*, files, cleft *and* hewn
with saws, with augers,<sup>[122](footnote/fn81.htm#P8184_2574846.md)</sup>
with axes, dug *and* hollowed out by the turning of borers, *and*
smoothed with planes. Is not this, then, an error? Is it not, to speak
accurately, folly to believe *that* a god which you yourself made with
care, to kneel down trembling in supplication to that which has been
formed by you, and while you know, and are assured that it is the
product<sup>[123](footnote/fn81.htm#P8185_2575332.md)</sup> of the labour
of your hands,<sup>[124](footnote/fn81.htm#P8186_2575511.md)</sup> -to cast
*yourself* down upon your face, beg aid suppliantly, and, in adversity
and time of distress, ask it to
succour<sup>[125](footnote/fn81.htm#P8187_2575669.md)</sup> *you* with
gracious and divine favour?

15\. Lo, if some one were to place before you copper in the lump, and
not formed<sup>[126](footnote/fn81.htm#P8189_2575972.md)</sup> into any
worlds *of art*, masses of unwrought silver, and gold not fashioned into
shape, wood, stones, and bones, with all the other materials of which
statues and images of deities usually consist,-nay, more, if some one
were to place before you the faces of battered gods, images melted
down<sup>[127](footnote/fn81.htm#P8190_2576296.md)</sup> and broken, and
were also to bid you slay victims to the bits and fragments, and give
sacred and divine honours to masses without form,-we ask you to say to
us, whether you would do this, or refuse to obey. Perhaps you will say,
why? Because there is no man so stupidly blind that he will class among
the gods silver, copper, gold, gypsum, ivory, potter's clay, and say
that these very things have, and possess in themselves, divine power.
What reason is there, then, that all these bodies should want the power
of deity and the rank of celestials if they remain untouched and
unwrought, *but* should forthwith become gods, and be classed and
numbered among the inhabitants of heaven if they receive the forms of
men, ears, noses, cheeks, lips, eyes, and eyebrows? Does the fashioning
add any newness to these bodies, so that from this addition you are
compelled<sup>[128](footnote/fn81.htm#P8191_2577224.md)</sup> to believe
that something divine and majestic has been united to them? Does it
change copper into gold, or compel worthless earthenware to become
silver? Does it cause things which but a little before were without
feeling, to live and
breathe?<sup>[129](footnote/fn81.htm#P8192_2577525.md)</sup> If they had
any natural properties
previously,<sup>[130](footnote/fn81.htm#P8193_2577625.md)</sup> all these
they retain<sup>[131](footnote/fn81.htm#P8194_2577707.md)</sup> when bulk
up in the bodily forms of statues. What stupidity it is-for I refuse to
call it blindness-to suppose that the natures of things are changed by
the kind of form into *which they are forced*, and that that receives
divinity from the appearance given D it, which in its original body has
been inert, and unreasoning, and unmoved by
feeling!<sup>[132](footnote/fn81.htm#P8195_2578325.md)</sup>

16\. And so unmindful and forgetful of what the substance and origin of
the images are, you, men, rational
beings<sup>[133](footnote/fn81.htm#P8197_2578490.md)</sup> and endowed with
the gift of wisdom and discretion, sink down before pieces of baked
earthenware, adore plates of copper, beg from the teeth of elephants
good health, magistracies, sovereignties, power, victories,
acquisitions, gains, very good harvests, and very rich vintages; and
while it is plain *and* clear that you are speaking to senseless things,
you think that you are heard, and bring yourselves into disgrace of your
own accord, by vainly and credulously deceiving
yourselves.<sup>[134](footnote/fn81.htm#P8198_2579011.md)</sup> Oh, would
that you might enter into some statue! rather, would that you might
separate<sup>[135](footnote/fn81.htm#P8199_2579259.md)</sup> and break up
into parts<sup>[136](footnote/fn82.htm#P8200_2579398.md)</sup> those
Olympian and Capitoline Jupiters, and behold all those parts alone and
by themselves which make up the whole of their bodies! You would at once
see that these gods of yours, to whom the smoothness *of their* exterior
gives a majestic appearance by its
alluring<sup>[137](footnote/fn82.htm#P8201_2579701.md)</sup> brightness,
are *only* a framework of
flexible<sup>[138](footnote/fn82.htm#P8202_2579778.md)</sup> plates,
particles without shape joined together; that they are kept from falling
into ruin and fear of destruction, by dove-tails and clamps and
brace-irons; and that lead is run into the midst of all the hollows and
where the joints meet, and causes
delay<sup>[139](footnote/fn82.htm#P8203_2580261.md)</sup> useful in
preserving them. You would see, I say, at once *that they have faces*
only without the rest of the
head,<sup>[140](footnote/fn82.htm#P8204_2580528.md)</sup> imperfect hands
without arms, bellies and sides in halves, incomplete
feet,<sup>[141](footnote/fn82.htm#P8205_2580623.md)</sup> and, which is
most ridiculous, *that they* have been put together without uniformity
in the construction of their bodies, being in one part made of wood, but
in the other of stone. Now, indeed, if these things could not be seen
through the skill with which they were kept out of
sight,<sup>[142](footnote/fn82.htm#P8206_2580934.md)</sup> even those at
least which lie open to all should have taught and instructed you that
you are effecting nothing, and giving your services in vain to dead
things. For, in this
case,<sup>[143](footnote/fn82.htm#P8207_2581156.md)</sup> do you not see
that these images, which seem to
breathe,<sup>[144](footnote/fn82.htm#P8208_2581320.md)</sup> whose feet and
knees you touch and handle when praying, at times fall into ruins from
the constant dropping of rain, at other times lose the firm union of
their parts from their decaying and becoming
rotten,<sup>[145](footnote/fn82.htm#P8209_2581570.md)</sup> -how they grow
black, being fumigated and discoloured by the steam *of sacrifices*, and
by smoke,-how with continued neglect they lose their
position<sup>[146](footnote/fn82.htm#P8210_2581771.md)</sup> and
appearance, and are eaten away with rust? In this case, I say, do yon
not see that newts, shrews, mice, and cockroaches, which shun the light,
build their nests and live under the hollow parts of these statues? that
they gather carefully into these all kinds of filth, and other things
suited to their wants, hard and half-gnawed bread, bones dragged
*thither* in view of *probable*
scarcity,<sup>[147](footnote/fn82.htm#P8211_2582391.md)</sup> rags, down,
*and* pieces of paper to make their nests soft, and keep their young
warm? Do you not see sometimes over the face of an image cobwebs and
treacherous nets spun by spiders, that they may be able to entangle in
them buzzing and imprudent flies while on the wing? Do you not see,
finally, that swallows full of filth, flying within the very domes of
the temples, toss *themselves* about, and bedaub now the very faces, now
the mouths of the deities, the beard, eyes, noses, and all the other
parts on which their
excrements<sup>[148](footnote/fn82.htm#P8212_2583060.md)</sup> fall? Blush,
then, even *though it is* late, and accept true methods and views from
dumb creatures, and let these teach you that there is nothing divine in
images, into which they do not fear or scruple to cast unclean things in
obedience to the laws of their being, and led by their unerring
instincts.<sup>[149](footnote/fn82.htm#P8213_2583453.md)</sup>

17\. But you err, *says my opponent*, and are mistaken, for we do not
consider either copper, or gold and silver, or those other materials of
which statues are made, to be in themselves gods and sacred deities; but
in them we worship and venerate those whom
their<sup>[150](footnote/fn82.htm#P8215_2583830.md)</sup> dedication as
sacred introduces and causes to dwell in statues made by workmen. The
reasoning is not vicious nor despicable by which any one-the dull, and
also the most intelligent-can believe that the gods, forsaking their
proper seats-that is, heaven-do not shrink back and avoid entering
earthly habitations; nay, more, that impelled by the rite of dedication,
they are joined to images Do your gods, then, dwell in gypsum and in
figures of earthenware? Nay, rather, are the gods the minds, spirits,
and souls of figures of earthenware and of gypsum? and, that the meanest
things may be able to become of greater importance, do they suffer
themselves to be shut up and concealed and confined
in<sup>[151](footnote/fn82.htm#P8216_2584566.md)</sup> an obscure abode?
Here, then, in the first place, we wish and ask to be told this by you:
do they do this against their will-that is, do they enter the images as
dwellings, dragged to *them* by the rite of dedication-or are they ready
and willing? and do you not summon them by any considerations of
necessity? Do they do this
unwillingly?<sup>[152](footnote/fn82.htm#P8217_2584950.md)</sup> and how
can it be possible that they should be compelled *to submit* to any
necessity without their dignity being impaired? With ready
assent?<sup>[153](footnote/fn82.htm#P8218_2585263.md)</sup> And what do the
gods seek for in figures of earthenware that they should prefer these
prisons<sup>[154](footnote/fn82.htm#P8219_2585571.md)</sup> to their starry
seats,-that, having been all but fastened to them, they should
ennoble<sup>[155](footnote/fn82.htm#P8220_2585683.md)</sup> earthenware and
the other substances of which images are made?

18\. What then? Do the gods remain always in such substances, and do
they not go away to any place, even though summoned by the most
momentous affairs? or do they have free passage, when they please to go
any whither, and to leave their own seats and images? If they are under
the necessity of remaining, what can be more wretched than they, what
more unfortunate than if hooks and leaden bonds hold them fast in this
wise on their pedestals? but *if* we allow that they prefer *these
images* to heaven and the starry seats, they have lost their divine
power.<sup>[156](footnote/fn82.htm#P8222_2586611.md)</sup> But if, on the
contrary, when they choose, they fly forth, and are perfectly free to
leave the statues empty, the images will then at some time cease to be
gods, and it will be doubtful when sacrifices should be offered,-when it
is right and fitting to withhold them. Oftentimes we see that by artists
these images are at one time made small, and reduced to the size of the
hand, at another raised to an immense height, and built up to a
wonderful size. In this way, then, it follows that we should understand
that the gods contract themselves
in<sup>[157](footnote/fn82.htm#P8223_2587669.md)</sup> little statuettes,
and are compressed till they become
like<sup>[158](footnote/fn82.htm#P8224_2587817.md)</sup> a strange body;
or, again, *that they* stretch themselves out to a great length, and
extend to immensity in images of vast bulk. So, then, if this is the
case, in sitting statues also the gods should be said to be seated, and
in standing ones to stand, to be running in those stretching forward to
run, to be hurling javelins in those *represented as* casting them, to
fit and fashion themselves to their countenances, and to make themselves
like<sup>[159](footnote/fn82.htm#P8225_2588308.md)</sup> the other
characteristics of the body formed by the *artist*.

19\. The gods dwell in images-each wholly in one, or divided into parts,
and into members? For neither is it possible that there can be at one
time one god in several images, nor, again, divided into parts by his
being cut up.<sup>[160](footnote/fn82.htm#P8227_2588638.md)</sup> For let
us suppose that there are ten thousand images of Vulcan in the whole
world: is it possible at all, as I said, that at one time one *deity*
can be in all the ten thousand? I do not think *so*. *Do you ask*
wherefore? Because things which are naturally single and unique, cannot
become many while the integrity of their
simplicity<sup>[161](footnote/fn82.htm#P8228_2589008.md)</sup> is
maintained. And this they are further unable *to become* if the gods
have the forms of men, as your belief declares; for either a hand
separated froth the head, or a foot divided from the body, cannot
manifest the perfection of the whole, or it must be said that parts can
be the same as the whole, while the whole cannot exist unless it has
been made by gathering together its parts. Moreover, if the same *deity*
shall be said to be in all *the statues*, all reasonableness and
soundness is lost to the truth, if this is assumed that at one tithe one
can remain in *them all*; or each of the gods must be said to divide
himself from himself, so that he is both himself and another, not
separated by any distinction, but himself the same as another. But as
nature rejects and spurns and scorns this, it must either be said and
confessed that there are Vulcans without number, if we decide that he
exists and is in all the images; or he will be in none, because he is
prevented by nature from being divided among several.

20\. And yet, O you-if it is plain and clear to you that tim gods live.
and that the inhabitants of heaven dwell in the inner parts of the
images, why do you guard, protect, and keep them shut up under the
strongest keys, and under fastenings of immense size, under iron bars,
bolts,<sup>[162](footnote/fn82.htm#P8230_2590549.md)</sup> and other such
things, and defend them with a thousand men and a thousand women to keep
guard, lest by chance some thief or nocturnal robber should creep in?
Why do you feed dogs in the
capitols?<sup>[163](footnote/fn82.htm#P8231_2590782.md)</sup> Why do you
give food and nourishment to geese? Rather, if you are assured that the
gods are there, and that they do not depart to any place from their
figures and images, leave to them the care of themselves, let their
shrines be always unlocked and open; and if anything is secretly carried
off by any one with reckless fraud, let them show the might of divinity,
and subject the sacrilegious robbers to fitting punishments at the
moment<sup>[164](footnote/fn82.htm#P8232_2591374.md)</sup> of their theft
and *wicked* deed. For it is unseemly, and subversive of their power and
majesty, to entrust the guardianship of the highest deities to the care
of dogs, and when you are seeking for some means of frightening thieves
so as to keep them away, not to beg it from *the gods* themselves, but
to set and place it in the cackling of geese.

21\. They say that Antiochus of Cyzicum took from its shrine a statue of
Jupiter made of gold
ten<sup>[165](footnote/fn82.htm#P8234_2591933.md)</sup> cubits *high*, and
set up in its place one made of copper covered with thin plates of gold.
If the gods are present, and dwell. in their own images, with what
business, with what cares, had Jupiter been entangled that he could not
punish the wrong done to himself, and avenge his being substituted in
baser metal? When the famous Dionysius-but *it was* the
younger<sup>[166](footnote/fn82.htm#P8235_2592514.md)</sup> -despoiled
Jupiter of his golden vestment, and put instead of it one of wool,
*and*, when mocking *him* with pleasantries also, he said that that
*which he was taking away* was cold in the frosts of winter, this warm,
that that one was cumbrous in summer, that this, again, was airy in hot
weather,-where was the king of the world that he did not show his
presence by some terrible deed, and recall the jocose buffoon to
soberness by bitter torments? For why should I mention that the dignity
of Aesculapius was mocked by him? For when Dionysius was spoiling him of
his very ample beard, *which was* of great weight and philosophic
thickness,<sup>[167](footnote/fn82.htm#P8236_2593643.md)</sup> he said that
it was not right that a son sprung from Apollo, a father smooth and
beardless, and very like a mere
boy,<sup>[168](footnote/fn82.htm#P8237_2594036.md)</sup> should be formed
with such a beard that it was left uncertain which of them was father,
which son, or rather whether they were of the
same<sup>[169](footnote/fn82.htm#P8238_2594192.md)</sup> race and family.
Now, when all these things were being done, and the robber was speaking
with impious mockery, if the deity was concealed in the statue
consecrated to his name and majesty, why did he not punish with just and
merited vengeance the affront of stripping his face of its beard and
disfiguring his countenance, and show by this, both that he was himself
present, and that he kept watch over his temples and images without
ceasing?

22\. But you will perhaps say that the gods do not trouble themselves
about these losses, and do not think that there is sufficient cause for
them to come forth and inflict punishment upon the offenders for their
impious sacrilege.<sup>[170](footnote/fn82.htm#P8240_2594885.md)</sup>
Neither. then. if this is the case, do they wish to have these images.
which they allow to be plucked up and torn away with impunity; nay, on
the contrary, they tell *us* plainly that they despise these *statues*,
in which they do not care to show that they were contemned, by taking
any revenge. Philostephanus relates in his *Cypriaca*, that Pygmalion,
king<sup>[171](footnote/fn82.htm#P8241_2595287.md)</sup> of Cyprus, loved
as a woman an image of Venus, which was held by the Cyprians holy and
venerable from ancient
times,<sup>[172](footnote/fn82.htm#P8242_2595457.md)</sup> his mind,
spirit, the light of his reason, and his judgment being darkened; and
that he was wont in his madness, just as if he were dealing with his
wife, having raised the deity to his couch, to be joined with it in
embraces and *face to* face, and to do other vain things, *carried away*
by a foolishly lustful
imagination.<sup>[173](footnote/fn82.htm#P8243_2595828.md)</sup> Similarly,
Posidippus,<sup>[174](footnote/fn82.htm#P8244_2595893.md)</sup> in the book
which he mentions *to have been* written about Gnidus and about its
affairs,<sup>[175](footnote/fn82.htm#P8245_2595999.md)</sup> relates that a
young man, of noble birth,-but he conceals his name,-carried away with
love of the Venus because of which Gnidus is famous, joined himself also
in amorous lewdness to the image of the same deity, stretched on the
genial couch, and
enjoying<sup>[176](footnote/fn82.htm#P8246_2596332.md)</sup> the pleasures
which ensue. To ask, again, in like manner: If the powers of the gods
above lurk in copper and the other substances of which images have been
formed, where in the world was the one Venus and the other to drive far
away from them the lewd wantonness of the youths, and punish their
impious touch with terrible
suffering?<sup>[177](footnote/fn82.htm#P8247_2596699.md)</sup> Or, as the
goddesses are gentle and of calmer dispositions, what would it have been
for them to assuage the furious joys
of<sup>[178](footnote/fn82.htm#P8248_2596859.md)</sup> the wretched men,
and to bring back their insane minds again to their senses?

23\. But perhaps, as you say, the goddesses took the greatest pleasure
in these lewd and lustful insults, and did not think that an action
requiring vengeance to be taken, which soothed their minds, and which
they knew was suggested to human desires by themselves. But if the
goddesses, the Venuses, being endowed with rather calm dispositions,
considered that favour should be shown to the misfortunes of the blinded
*youths*; when the greedy flames so often consumed the Capitol, and had
destroyed the Capitoline Jupiter himself with his wife and his
daughter,<sup>[179](footnote/fn82.htm#P8250_2597515.md)</sup> where was the
Thunderer at that time to avert that calamitous fire, and preserve from
destruction his property, and himself, and all his family? Where was the
queenly Juno when a violent fire destroyed her famous shrine, and her
priestess<sup>[180](footnote/fn82.htm#P8251_2597786.md)</sup> Chrysis in
Argos? Where the Egyptian Serapis, when by a similar disaster *his
temple* fell, burned to ashes, with all the mysteries, and Isis? Where
Liber Eleutherius, when *his temple fell* at Athens? Where Diana, when
*hers fell* at Ephesus? Where Jupiter of Dodona, when *his fell* at
Dodona? Where, finally, the prophetic Apollo, when by pirates and sea
robbers he was both plundered and set on
fire,<sup>[181](footnote/fn82.htm#P8252_2598431.md)</sup> so that out of so
many pounds of gold, which ages without number had heaped up, he did not
have one scruple even to show to the swallows which built under his
caves,<sup>[182](footnote/fn82.htm#P8253_2599040.md)</sup> as Varro says in
his *Saturae
Menippeoe*?<sup>[183](footnote/fn82.htm#P8254_2599119.md)</sup> It would be
an endless task to write down what shrines have been destroyed
throughout the whole world by earth quakes and tempests-what have been
set on fire by enemies, and by kings and tyrants-what have been stript
bare by the overseers and priests themselves, even though they have
turned suspicion away from
them<sup>[184](footnote/fn82.htm#P8255_2599537.md)</sup> -finally, what
*have been robbed* by thieves and
Canacheni,<sup>[185](footnote/fn82.htm#P8256_2599635.md)</sup> opening them
up, though barred by unknown
means;<sup>[186](footnote/fn82.htm#P8257_2600011.md)</sup> which, indeed,
would remain safe and exposed to no mischances, if the gods were present
to defend them, or had any care for their temples, as is said. But now
because they are empty, and protected by no indwellers, Fortune has
power over them, and they are exposed to all accidents just as much as
are all other things which have not
life.<sup>[187](footnote/fn82.htm#P8258_2600487.md)</sup>

24\. Here also the advocates of images are wont to say this also, that
the ancients knew well that images have no divine nature, and that there
is no sense in them, but that they formed them profitably and wisely,
for the sake of the unmanageable and ignorant mob, which is the majority
in nations and in states, in order that a kind of appearance, as it
were, of deities being presented to them, from fear they might shake off
their rude natures, and, supposing that they were acting in the presence
of the gods, put<sup>[188](footnote/fn82.htm#P8260_2601036.md)</sup> away
their impious deeds, and, changing their manners, learn to act as
men;<sup>[189](footnote/fn82.htm#P8261_2601376.md)</sup> and that august
forms of gold and silver were sought for them, for no other reason than
that some power was believed to reside in their splendour, such as not
only to dazzle the eyes, but even to strike terror into the mind itself
at the majestic beaming lustre. Now this might perhaps seem to be said
with some reason, if, after the temples of the gods were founded, and
their images set up, there were no wicked man in the world, no villany
at all, *if* justice, peace, good faith, possessed the hearts of men,
and no one on earth were called guilty and guiltless, all being ignorant
of wicked deeds. But now when, on the contrary, all things are full of
wicked *men*, the name of innocence has almost perished, *and* every
moment, every second, evil deeds, till now unheard of, spring to light
in myriads from the wickedness of wrongdoers, how is it right to say
that images have been set up for the purpose of striking terror into the
mob, while, besides innumerable forms of crime and
wickedness,<sup>[190](footnote/fn82.htm#P8262_2602411.md)</sup> we see that
even the temples themselves are attacked by tyrants, by kings, by
robbers, and by nocturnal thieves, and that these very gods whom
antiquity fashioned and consecrated to cause terror, are carried
away<sup>[191](footnote/fn82.htm#P8263_2602664.md)</sup> into the caves of
robbers, in spite even of the terrible splendour of the
gold?<sup>[192](footnote/fn82.htm#P8264_2602771.md)</sup>

25\. For what grandeur-if you look at the truth without any
prejudice<sup>[193](footnote/fn82.htm#P8266_2602913.md)</sup> -is there in
these images<sup>[194](footnote/fn82.htm#P8267_2602994.md)</sup> of which
they speak, that the men of old should have had reason to hope and think
that, by beholding them, the vices of men could be subdued, and their
morals and wicked ways brought under
restraint?<sup>[195](footnote/fn82.htm#P8268_2603253.md)</sup> The
reaping-hook, for example, which was assigned to
Saturn,<sup>[196](footnote/fn82.htm#P8269_2603474.md)</sup> was it to
inspire mortals with fear, that they should be willing to live
peacefully, and to abandon their malicious inclinations? Janus, with
double face, or that spiked key by which he has been distinguished;
Jupiter, cloaked and bearded, and holding in his right hand a piece of
wood shaped like a thunderbolt; the cestus of
Juno,<sup>[197](footnote/fn82.htm#P8270_2603834.md)</sup> or the maiden
lurking under a soldier's helmet; the mother of the gods, with her
timbrel; the Muses, with their pipes and psalteries; Mercury, the winged
slayer of Argus; Aesculapius, with his staff; Ceres, with huge breasts,
or the drinking cup swinging in Liber's right hand; Mulciber, with his
workman s dress; or Fortune, with her horn full of apples, figs, or
autumnal fruits; Diana, with half-covered thighs, or Venus naked,
exciting to lustful desire; Anubis, with his dog's face; or Priapus, of
less importance<sup>[198](footnote/fn82.htm#P8271_2604483.md)</sup> than
his own genitals: *were these expected to make men afraid?*

26\. O dreadful forms of terror
and<sup>[199](footnote/fn82.htm#P8273_2604606.md)</sup> frightful
bugbears<sup>[200](footnote/fn82.htm#P8274_2604644.md)</sup> on account of
which the human race was to be benumbed for ever, to attempt nothing in
its utter amazement, and to restrain itself from every wicked and
shameful act-little sickles, keys, caps, pieces of wood, winged sandals,
staves, little timbrels, pipes, psalteries, breasts protruding and of
great size, little drinking cups, pincers, and horns filled with fruit,
the naked bodies of women, and huge *veretra* openly exposed! Would it
not have been better to dance *and* to sing, than calling it gravity and
pretending to be serious, to relate what is so insipid and so silly,
that images<sup>[201](footnote/fn82.htm#P8275_2605249.md)</sup> were formed
by the ancients to check wrongdoing, and to *arouse* the fears of the
wicked and impious? Were the men of that age and time, in understanding,
so void of reason and good sense, that they were kept back from wicked
actions, just as if they were little boys, by the
preternatural<sup>[202](footnote/fn82.htm#P8276_2605604.md)</sup>
savageness of masks, by grimaces also, and
bugbears?<sup>[203](footnote/fn82.htm#P8277_2605876.md)</sup> And how has
this been so entirely changed, that though there are so many temples in
your states filled with images of all the gods, the multitude of
criminals cannot be resisted *even* with so many laws and so terrible
punishments, and their audacity cannot be
overcome<sup>[204](footnote/fn82.htm#P8278_2606456.md)</sup> by any means,
and wicked deeds, repeated again and again, multiply the more it is
striven by laws and *severe* judgments to lessen the number of cruel
deeds, and to quell them by the check *given by means* of punishments?
But if images caused any fear to men, the passing of laws would cease,
nor would so many kinds of tortures be established against the daring of
the guilty: now, however, because it has been proved and established
that the supposed<sup>[205](footnote/fn82.htm#P8279_2606930.md)</sup>
terror which is said to flow out from the images is in reality vain,
recourse has been had to the ordinances of laws, by which there might be
a dread *of punishment which should be* most certain fixed in men's
minds also, and a condemnation settled; to which these very images also
owe it that they yet stand safe, and secured by some respect being
yielded to them.
