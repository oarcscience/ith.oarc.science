##  The Second Homily

On the Annunciation to the Holy Virgin
Mary.<sup>[1](footnote/fn11.md)</sup>

It is our duty to present to God, like sacrifices, all the festivals and
hymnal celebrations; and first of all, the annunciation to the holy
mother of God, to wit, the salutation made to her by the angel, "Hail,
thou that art highly favoured!" For first of all
wisdom<sup>[2](footnote/fn11.htm#P1191_296906.md)</sup> and saving doctrine
in the New Testament was this salutation, "Hail, thou that art highly
favoured!" conveyed to us from the Father of lights. And this address,
"highly favoured,"<sup>[3](footnote/fn11.htm#P1192_297112.md)</sup>
embraced the whole nature of men. "Hail, thou that art highly
favoured"<sup>[4](footnote/fn11.htm#P1193_297210.md)</sup> in the holy
conception and in the glorious pregnancy, "I bring you good tidings of
great joy, which shall be to all
people."<sup>[5](footnote/fn11.htm#P1194_297361.md)</sup> And again the
Lord, who came for the purpose of accomplishing a saving passion, said,
"I will see you, and ye shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from
you."<sup>[6](footnote/fn11.htm#P1195_297540.md)</sup> And after His
resurrection again, by the hand of the holy women, He gave us first of
all the salutation "Hail!
"<sup>[7](footnote/fn11.htm#P1196_297670.md)</sup> And again, the apostle
made the announcement in similar terms, saying, "Rejoice evermore: pray
without ceasing: in everything give
thanks."<sup>[8](footnote/fn11.htm#P1197_297830.md)</sup> See, then, dearly
beloved, how the Lord has conferred upon us everywhere, and indivisibly,
the joy that is beyond conception, and perennial. For since the holy
Virgin, in the life of the flesh, was in possession of the incorruptible
citizenship, and walked as such in all manner of virtues, and lived a
life more excellent than man's common standard; therefore the Word that
cometh from God the Father thought it meet to assume the flesh, and
endue the perfect man from her, in order that in the same flesh in which
sin entered into the world, and death by sin, sin might be condemned in
the flesh, and that the tempter of sin might be overcome in the
burying<sup>[9](footnote/fn11.htm#P1198_298512.md)</sup> of the holy body,
and that therewith also the beginning of the resurrection might be
exhibited, and life eternal instituted in the world, and fellowship
established for men with God the Father. And what shall we state, or
what shall we pass by here? or who shall explain what is
incomprehensible in the mystery? But for the present let us fall back
upon our subject. Gabriel was sent to the holy virgin; the incorporeal
was despatched to her who in the body pursued the incorruptible
conversation, and lived in purity and in virtues. And when he came to
her, he first addressed her with the salutation, "Hail, thou that art
highly favoured! the Lord is with thee." Hail, thou that art highly
favoured! for thou doest what is worthy of joy indeed, since thou hast
put on the vesture of purity, and art girt with the cincture of
prudence. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for to thy lot it has
fallen to be the vehicle of celestial joy. Hail, thou that art highly
favoured! for through thee joy is decreed for the whole creation, and
the human race receives again by thee its pristine dignity. Hail, thou
that art highly favoured! for in thy arms the Creator of all things
shall be carried. And she was perplexed by this word; for she was
inexperienced in all the addresses of men, and welcomed quiet, as the
mother of prudence and purity; (yet) being a pure, and immaculate, and
stainless image<sup>[10](footnote/fn11.htm#P1199_299997.md)</sup> herself,
she shrank not in terror from the angelic apparition, like most of the
prophets, as indeed true virginity has a kind of affinity and equality
with the angels. For the holy Virgin guarded carefully the torch of
virginity, and gave diligent heed that it should not be extinguished or
defiled. And as one who is clad in a brilliant robe deems it a matter of
great moment that no impurity or filth be suffered to touch it anywhere,
so did the holy Mary consider with herself, and said: Does this act of
attention imply any deep design or seductive purpose? Shall this word
"Hail" prove the cause of trouble to me, as of old the fair promise of
being made like God, which was given her by the serpent-devil, proved to
our first mother Eve? Has the devil, who is the author of all evil,
become transformed again into an angel of light; and bearing a grudge
against my espoused husband for his admirable temperance, and having
assailed him with some fair-seeming address, and finding himself
powerless to overcome a mind so firm, and to deceive the man, has he
turned his attack upon me, as one endowed with a more susceptible mind;
and is this word "Hail" (Grace be with thee) spoken as the sign of
gracelessness hereafter? Is this benediction and salutation uttered in
irony? Is there not some poison concealed in the honey? Is it not the
address of one who brings good tidings, while the end of the same is to
make me the designer's prey? And how is it that he can thus salute one
whom he knows not? These things she pondered in perplexity with herself,
and expressed in words. Then again the archangel addressed her with the
announcement of a joy which all may believe in, and which shall not be
taken away, and said to her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour
with God." Shortly hast thou the proof of what has been said. For I not
only give yon to understand that there is nothing to fear, but I show
you the very key to the absence of all cause for fear. For through me
all the heavenly powers hail thee, the holy virgin: yea rather, He
Himself, who is Lord of all the heavenly powers and of all creation, has
selected thee as the holy one and the wholly fair; and through thy holy,
and chaste, and pure, and undefiled womb the enlightening Pearl comes
forth for the salvation of all the world: since of all the race of man
thou art by birth the holy one, and the more honourable, and the purer,
and the more pious than any other: and thou hast a mind whiter than the
snow, and a body made purer than any gold, however fine, and a womb such
as the object which Ezekiel saw, and which he has described in these
terms: "And the likeness of the living creatures upon the head was as
the firmament, and as the appearance of the terrible crystal, and the
likeness of the throne above them was as the appearance of a
sapphire-stone: and above the throne it was as the likeness of a man,
and as the appearance of amber; and within it there was, as it were, the
likeness of fire round
about."<sup>[11](footnote/fn12.htm#P1200_303014.md)</sup>

Clearly, then, did the prophet behold in type Him who was born of the
holy virgin, whom thou, O holy virgin, wouldest have had no strength to
bear, hadst thou not beamed forth for that
time<sup>[12](footnote/fn12.htm#P1202_303230.md)</sup> with all that is
glorious and virtuous. And with what words of laudation, then, shall we
describe her virgin-dignity? With what indications and proclamations of
praise shall we celebrate her stainless figure? With what spiritual song
or word shall we honour her who is most glorious among the angels? She
is planted in the house of God like a fruitful olive that the Holy
Spirit overshadowed; and by her means are we called sons and heirs of
the kingdom of Christ. She is the ever-blooming paradise of
incorruptibility, wherein is planted the tree that giveth life, and that
furnisheth to all the fruits of immortality. She is the boast and glory
of virgins, and the exultation of mothers. She is the sure support of
the believing, and the
succourer<sup>[13](footnote/fn12.htm#P1203_304004.md)</sup> of the pious.
She is the vesture of light, and the domicile of
virtue.<sup>[14](footnote/fn12.htm#P1204_304104.md)</sup> She is the
ever-flowing fountain, wherein the water of life sprang and produced the
Lord's incarnate manifestation. She is the monument of righteousness;
and all who become lovers of her, and set their affections on
virgin-like ingenuousness and purity, shall enjoy the grace of angels.
All who keep themselves from wine and intoxication, and from the wanton
enjoyments of strong drink, shall be made glad with the products of the
life-bearing plant. All who have preserved the lamp of virginity
unextinguished shall be privileged to receive the amaranthine crown of
immortality. All who have possessed themselves of the stainless robe of
temperance shall be received into the mystical bride-chamber of
righteousness. All who have come nearer the angelic degree than others
shall also enter into the more real enjoyment of their Lord's beatitude.
All who have possessed the illuminating oil of understanding, and the
pure incense of conscience, shall inherit the promise of spiritual
favour and the spiritual adoption. All who worthily observe the festival
of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, the mother of God, acquire as
their meet recompense the fuller interest in the message, "Hail, thou
that art highly favoured!" It is our duty, therefore, to keep this
feast, seeing that it has tilled the whole world with joy and gladness.
And let us keep it with psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs. Of old
did Israel also keep their festival, but then it was with unleavened
bread and bitter herbs, of which the prophet says: "I will turn their
feasts into afflictions and lamentation, and their joy into
shame."<sup>[15](footnote/fn12.htm#P1205_305734.md)</sup> But our
afflictions our Lord has assured us He will turn into joy by the fruits
of penitence.<sup>[16](footnote/fn12.htm#P1206_305848.md)</sup> And again,
the first covenant maintained the righteous
requirements<sup>[17](footnote/fn12.htm#P1207_305936.md)</sup> of a divine
service, as in the case of our forefather Abraham; but these stood in
the inflictions of pain in the flesh by circumcision, until the time of
the fulfilment. "The law was given to them through Moses" for their
discipline; "but grace and truth" have been given to us by Jesus
Christ.<sup>[18](footnote/fn12.htm#P1208_306277.md)</sup> The beginning of
all these blessings to us appeared in the annunciation to Mary, the
highly-favoured, in the economy of the Saviour which is worthy of all
praise, and in His divine and supra-mundane instruction. Thence rise the
rays of the light of understanding upon us. Thence spring for us the
fruits of wisdom and immortality, sending forth the clear pure streams
of piety. Thence come to us the brilliant splendours of the treasures of
divine knowledge. "For this is life eternal, that we may know the true
God, and Jesus Christ whom He hath
sent."<sup>[19](footnote/fn12.htm#P1209_306848.md)</sup> And again, "Search
the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal
life."<sup>[20](footnote/fn12.htm#P1210_306946.md)</sup> For on this
account the treasure of the knowledge of God is revealed to them who
search the divine oracles. That treasure of the inspired Scriptures the
Paraclete has unfolded to us this day. And let the tongue of prophecy
and the doctrine of apostles be the treasure of wisdom to us; for
without the law and the prophets, or the evangelists and the apostles,
it is not possible to have the certain hope of salvation. For by the
tongue of the holy prophets and apostles our Lord speaks, and God takes
pleasure in the words of the saints; not that He requires the spoken
address, but that He delights in the good disposition; not that He
receives any profit from men, but that He finds a restful satisfaction
in the rightly-affected soul of the righteous. For it is not that Christ
is magnified by what we say; but as we receive benefits from Him, we
proclaim with grateful mind His beneficence to us; not that we can
attain to what is worthy therein, but that we give the meet return to
the best of our ability. And when the Gospels or the Epistles,
therefore, are read, let not your attention centre on the book or on the
reader, but on the God who speaks to you from heaven. For the book is
but that which is seen, while Christ is the divine subject spoken of. It
brings us then the glad tidings of that economy of the Saviour, which is
worthy of all praise, to wit, that, though He was God, He became man
through kindness toward man, and did not lay aside, indeed, the dignity
which was His from all eternity, but assumed the economy that should
work salvation. It brings us the glad tidings of that economy of the
Saviour worthy of all praise, to wit, that He sojourned with us as a
physician for the sick, who did not heal them with potions, but restored
them by the inclination of His philanthropy.

It brings us the glad tidings of this economy of the Saviour altogether
to be praised, to wit, that to them who had wandered astray the way of
salvation was shown, and that to the despairing the grace of salvation
was made known, which blesses all in different modes; searching after
the erring, enlightening the blinded, giving life to the dead, setting
free the slaves, redeeming the captives, and becoming all things to all
of us in order to be the true way of salvation to us: and all this He
does, not by reason of our goodwill toward Him, but in virtue of a
benignity that is proper to our Benefactor Himself. For the Saviour did
all, not in order that He might acquire virtue Himself, but that He
might put us in possession of eternal life. He made man, indeed, after
the image of God, and appointed him to live in a paradise of pleasure.
But the man being deceived by the devil, and having become a
transgressor of the divine commandment, was made subject to the doom of
death. Whence, also, those born of him were involved in their father's
liability in virtue of their succession, and had the reckoning of
condemnation required of them. "For death reigned from Adam to
Moses."<sup>[21](footnote/fn12.htm#P1212_309986.md)</sup> But the Lord. in
His benignity toward man, when He saw the creature He Himself had formed
now held by the power of death, did not turn away finally from him whom
He had made in His own image, but visited him in each generation, and
forsook him not; and manifesting Himself first of all among the
patriarchs, and then proclaiming Himself in the law, and presenting the
likeness of Himself<sup>[22](footnote/fn12.htm#P1213_310391.md)</sup> in
the prophets, He presignified the economy of salvation. When, moreover,
the fulness of the times came for His glorious appearing, He sent
beforehand the archangel Gabriel to bear the glad tidings to the Virgin
Mary. And he came down from the ineffable powers above to the holy
Virgin, and addressed her first of all with the salutation, "Hail, thou
that art highly favoured." And when this word, "Hail, thou that art
highly favoured," reached her, in the very moment of her hearing it, the
Holy Spirit entered into the undefiled temple of the Virgin, and her
mind and her members were sanctified together. And nature stood
opposite, and natural intercourse at a distance, beholding with
amazement the Lord of nature, in a manner contrary to nature, or rather
above nature, doing a miraculous work in the body; and by the very
weapons by which the devil strove against us, Christ also saved us,
taking to Himself our passible body in order that He might impart the
greater grace<sup>[23](footnote/fn12.htm#P1214_311392.md)</sup> to the
being who was deficient in it. And "where sin abounded, grace did much
more abound." And appropriately was grace sent to the holy Virgin. For
this word also is contained in the oracle of the evangelic history: "And
in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent to a virgin espoused to a
man whose name was Joseph, of the house and lineage of David; and the
virgin's name was Mary; "<sup>[24](footnote/fn12.htm#P1215_311796.md)</sup>
and so forth. And this was the first month to the holy Virgin. Even as
Scripture says in the book of the law: "This month shall be unto you the
beginning of months: it shall be the first month among the months of the
year to you."<sup>[25](footnote/fn12.htm#P1216_312082.md)</sup> "Keep ye
the feast of the holy passover to the Lord in all your generations." it
was also the sixth month to Zacharias. And rightly, then, did the holy
Virgin prove to be of the family of David, and she had her home in
Bethlehem, and was betrothed rightfully to Joseph, in accordance with
the laws of relationship. And her espoused husband was her guardian, and
possessor also of the untarnished incorruption which was hers. And the
name given to the holy Virgin was one that became her exceedingly. For
she was called Mary, and that, by interpretation, means *illumination*.
And what shines more brightly that the light of virginity? For this
reason also the virtues are called virgins by those who strive rightly
to get at their true nature. But if it is so great a blessing to have a
virgin heart, how great a boon will it be to have the flesh that
cherishes virginity along with the soul!

Thus the holy Virgin, while still in the flesh, maintained the
incorruptible life, and received in faith the things which were
announced by the archangel. And thereafter she journeyed diligently to
her relation Elisabeth in the hill-country. "And she entered into the
house of Zacharias, and saluted
Elisabeth,"<sup>[26](footnote/fn12.htm#P1218_313343.md)</sup> in imitation
of the angel. "And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the
salutation of Mary, the babe leapt with joy in her womb; and Elisabeth
was filled with the Holy
Ghost."<sup>[27](footnote/fn12.htm#P1219_313544.md)</sup> Thus the voice of
Mary wrought with power, and filled Elisabeth with the Holy Ghost. And
by her tongue, as from an ever-flowing fountain, she sent forth a stream
of gracious gifts in the way of prophecy to her relation; and while the
feet of her child were bound in the
womb,<sup>[28](footnote/fn12.htm#P1220_313837.md)</sup> she prepared to
dance and leap. And that was the sign of a marvellous jubilation. For
wherever she was who was highly favoured, there she filled all things
with joy. "And Elisabeth spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed
art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence
is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? Blessed art
thou among women."<sup>[29](footnote/fn12.htm#P1221_314287.md)</sup> For
thou hast become to women the beginning of the new
creation.<sup>[30](footnote/fn12.htm#P1222_314373.md)</sup> Thou hast given
to us boldness of access into paradise, and thou hast put to flight our
ancient woe. For after thee the race of woman shall no more be made the
subject of reproach. No more do the successors of Eve fear the ancient
curse, or the pangs of childbirth. For Christ, the Redeemer of our race,
the Saviour of all nature, the spiritual Adam who has healed the hurt of
the creature of earth, cometh forth from thy holy womb. "Blessed art
thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb." For He who
bears all blessings for us is manifested as thy fruit. This we read in
the clear words of her who was barren; but yet more clearly did the holy
Virgin herself express this again when she presented to God the song
replete with thanksgiving, and acceptance, and divine knowledge;
announcing ancient things together with what was new; proclaiming along
with things which were of old, things also which belong to the
consummation of the ages; and summing up in a short discourse the
mysteries of Christ. "And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and
my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour," and so forth. "He hath
holpen His servant Israel in remembrance of His mercy, and of the
covenant which He established with Abraham and with his seed for
ever."<sup>[31](footnote/fn12.htm#P1223_315666.md)</sup> Thou seest how the
holy Virgin has surpassed even the perfection of the patriarchs, and how
she confirms the covenant which was made with Abraham by God, when He
said, "This is the covenant which I shall establish between me and
thee."<sup>[32](footnote/fn12.htm#P1224_315924.md)</sup> Wherefore He has
come and confirmed the covenant with Abraham, having received mystically
in Himself the sign of circumcision, and having proved Himself the
fulfilment of the law and the prophets. This song of prophecy,
therefore, did the holy mother of God render to God, saying, "My soul
doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour:
for He that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is His
name." For having made me the mother of God, He has also preserved me a
virgin; and by my womb the fulness of all generations is headed up
together for sanctification. For He hath blessed every age, both men and
women, both young men and youths, and old men. "He hath made strength
with His arm,"<sup>[33](footnote/fn12.htm#P1225_316682.md)</sup> on our
behalf, against death and against the devil, having torn the handwriting
of our sins. "He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their
hearts; "yea, He hath scattered the devil himself, and all the demons
that serve under him. For he was overweeningly haughty in his heart,
seeing that he dared to say, "I will set my throne above the clouds, and
I will be like the Most
High."<sup>[34](footnote/fn12.htm#P1226_317092.md)</sup> And now, how He
scattered him the prophet has indicated in what follows, where he says,
"Yet now thou shalt be brought down to
hell,"<sup>[35](footnote/fn12.htm#P1227_317245.md)</sup> and all thy hosts
with thee. For He has overthrown everywhere his altars and the worship
of vain gods, and He has prepared for Himself a peculiar people out of
the heathen nations. "He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and
exalted them of low degree." In these terms is intimated in brief the
extrusion of the Jews and the admission of the Gentiles. For the elders
of the Jews and the scribes in the law, and those who were richly
privileged with other prerogatives, because they used their riches ill
and their power lawlessly, were cast down by Him from every seat,
whether of prophecy or of priesthood, whether of legislature or of
doctrine, and were stripped of all their ancestral wealth, and of their
sacrifices and multitudinous festivals, and of all the honourable
privileges of the kingdom. Spoiled of all these boons, as naked
fugitives they were cast out into captivity. And in their stead the
humble were exalted, namely, the Gentile peoples who hungered after
righteousness. For, discovering their own lowliness, and the hunger that
pressed upon them for the knowledge of God, they pleaded for the divine
word, though it were but for crumbs of the same, like the woman of
Canaan;<sup>[36](footnote/fn12.htm#P1228_318467.md)</sup> and for this
reason they were filled with the riches of the divine mysteries. For the
Christ who was born of the Virgin, and who is our God, has given over
the whole inheritance of divine blessings to the Gentiles. "He hath
holpen His servant
Israel."<sup>[37](footnote/fn12.htm#P1229_318738.md)</sup> Not any Israel
in general, indeed, but His servant, who in very deed maintains the true
nobility of Israel. And on this account also did the mother of God call
Him servant (Son) and heir. For when He had found the same labouring
painfully in the letter and the law, He called him by grace. It is such
an Israel, therefore, that He called and hath holpen in remembrance of
His mercy. "As He spake to our fathers, I to Abraham and to his seed for
ever." In these few words is comprehended the whole mystery of the
economy. For, with the purpose of saving the race of men, and fulfilling
the covenant that was made with our fathers, Christ has once "bowed the
heavens and come down."<sup>[38](footnote/fn12.htm#P1230_319436.md)</sup>
And thus He shows Himself to us as we are capable of receiving Him, in
order that we might have power to see Him, and handle Him, and hear Him
when the speaketh. And on this account did God the Word deem it meet to
take to Himself the flesh and the perfect humanity by a woman, the holy
Virgin; and He was born a man, in order that He might discharge our
debt, and fulfil even in
Himself<sup>[39](footnote/fn12.htm#P1231_319843.md)</sup> the ordinances of
the covenant made with Abraham, in its rite of circumcision, and all the
other legal appointments connected with it. And after she had spoken
these words the holy Virgin went to Nazareth; and from that a decree of
Caesar led her to come again to Bethlehem; and so, as proceeding herself
from the royal house, she was brought to the royal house of David along
with Joseph her espoused husband. And there ensued there the mystery
which transcends all wonders,-the Virgin brought forth and bore in her
hand Him who bears the whole creation by His word. "And there was no
room for them in the
inn."<sup>[40](footnote/fn12.htm#P1232_320479.md)</sup> He found no room
who founded the whole earth by His word. She nourished with her milk Him
who imparts sustenance and life to everything that hath breath. She
wrapped Him in swaddling-clothes who binds the whole creation fast with
His word. She laid Him in a manger who rides seated upon the
cherubim.<sup>[41](footnote/fn12.htm#P1233_320797.md)</sup> A light from
heaven shone round about Him who lighteneth the whole creation. The
hosts of heaven attended Him with their doxologies who is glorified in
heaven from before all ages. A star with its torch guided them who had
come from the distant parts of earth toward Him who is the true Orient.
From the East came those who brought gifts to Him who for our sakes
became poor. And the holy mother of God kept these words, and pondered
them in her heart, like one who was the receptacle of all the mysteries.
Thy praise, O most holy Virgin, surpasses all laudation, by reason of
the God who received the flesh and was born man of thee. To thee every
creature, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the
earth, offers the meet offering of honour. For thou hast been indeed set
forth as the true cherubic throne. Thou shinest as the very brightness
of light in the high places of the kingdoms of
intelligence;<sup>[42](footnote/fn12.htm#P1234_321741.md)</sup> where the
Father, who is without beginning, and whose power thou hadst
overshadowing thee, is glorified; where also the Son is worshipped, whom
thou didst bear according to the flesh; and where the Holy Spirit is
praised, who effected in thy womb the generation of the mighty King.
Through thee, O thou that art highly favoured, is the holy and
consubstantial Trinity known in the world. Together with thyself, deem
us also worthy to be made partakers of thy perfect grace in Jesus Christ
our Lord: with whom, and with the Holy Spirit, be glory to the Father,
now and ever, and unto the ages of the ages.
Amen.<sup>[43](footnote/fn12.htm#P1235_322470.md)</sup>
