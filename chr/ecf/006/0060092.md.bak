##  General Note.

As I have not infrequently treated the rise of the great Alexandrian
school as an outcrop from the learning and piety of Apollos, I take this
space to record my reasons: 1. Apart from the question in formal shape,
I hold that the character and influence of this brilliant Alexandrian
*must* have operated upon Alexandrian converts. 2. But the frequent
employment by the Alexandrians of the expressions (Acts xviii. 24) used
concerning him by St. Luke, almost textually, confirms my suspicion that
they had his high example always before them. 3. The catechetical school
was certainly established in Alexandria from apostolic
times.<sup>[729](footnote/fn40.htm#P4057_1165010.md)</sup> By whom more
probably than by Apollos? 4. St. Mark's connection with Alexandria rests
on no scriptural evidence, yet it is credited. 5. That of Apollos is
narrated in Scripture, and I can conceive of nothing so probable as
that, remembering his own instruction by Aquila and Priscilla (Acts
xviii. 26), be should have founded catechetical schools for others, 6.
All this is conjectural, indeed, but it agrees with known facts. 7. The
silence of Clement and the rest is an objection quite as fatal to the
claims of St. Mark. 8. The unanimity of the Alexandrians, from Pantaenus
downward, in assigning to St. Paul the authorship of the Epistle to the
Hebrews, while it was so much debated elsewhere, suggests that they had
early evidence on this point. 9. Clement's testimony about St. Luke
convinces me that Apollos had no claim to it, but had testified to the
Alexandrians that the Apostle was the author, and St. Luke his
*inspired* amanuensis by whom the words were not servilely taken down,
but reported in idioms of his own: whether out of St. Paul's "Hebrew" or
not, is another question. 10. Apollos disappears from history about a.d.
64, *on his way
homeward*,<sup>[730](footnote/fn40.htm#P4058_1167092.md)</sup> bearing the
Epistle to Titus, and (who can doubt? ) a copy, of that to the Hebrews,
written the previous year. All these facts agree with my conjectures
that Apollos closed his labours in his native city.
