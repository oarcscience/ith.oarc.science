##  I.-A Fragment of a Work of Pierius on the First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians.<sup>[1](footnote/fn28.htm#P2816_743041.md)</sup>

------------

Origen, Dionysius, Pierius, Eusebius of Caesareia, Didymus, and
Apollinaris, have interpreted this epistle most
copiously;<sup>[2](footnote/fn28.htm#P2819_743260.md)</sup> of whom
Pierius, when he was expounding and unfolding the meaning of the
apostle, and purposed to explain the words. *For I would that all men
were even as I myself*,<sup>[3](footnote/fn28.htm#P2820_743439.md)</sup>
added this remark: In saying this, Paul, without disguise, preaches
celibacy.<sup>[4](footnote/fn28.htm#P2821_743535.md)</sup>
