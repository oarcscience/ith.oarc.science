##  IV.-The Passion of St. Symphorosa and Her Seven Sons.<sup>[1](footnote/fn23.md)</sup>

------------

> The text is given from the edition of Ruinart. His preface, which
> Migne also cites, is as follows: "The narrative of the martyrdom of
> St. Symphorosa and her seven sons, which we here publish, is ascribed
> in the mss. to Julius Africanus, a writer of the highest repute. And
> it may perhaps have been inserted in his books on *Chronography*,--a
> work which Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. vi. 31) testifies to have been
> written with the greatest care, since in these he detailed the chief
> events in history from the foundation of the world to the times of the
> Emperor Heliogabalus. As that work, however, is lost, that this
> narrative is really to be ascribed to Africanus, I would not venture
> positively to assert, although at the same time there seems no ground
> for doubting its genuineness. We print it, moreover, from the editions
> of Mombritius, Surius, and Cardulus, collated with two Colbert mss.
> and one in the library of the Sorbonne. The occasion for the death of
> these saints was found in the vicinity of that most famous palace
> which was built by Adrian at his country seat at Tiber, according to
> Spartianus. For when the emperor gave orders that this palace, which
> he had built for his pleasure, should be purified by some piacular
> ceremonies, the priests seized this opportunity for accusing
> Symphorosa, alleging that the gods would not be satisfied until
> Symphorosa should either sacrifice to them or be herself sacrificed;
> which last thing was done by Hadrian, whom, from many others of his
> deeds, we know to have been exceedingly superstitious, about the year
> of Christ 120, that is, about the beginning of his reign, at which
> period indeed, as Dio Cassius observes, that emperor put a great
> number to death. The memory of these martyrs, moreover, is celebrated
> in all the most ancient martyrologies, although they assign different
> days for it. The Roman, along with Notker, fixes their festival for
> the 18th July, Rabanus for the 21st of the same month, Usuardus and
> Ado for the 21st June. In the Tiburtine road there still exists the
> rubbish of an old church, as Aringhi states (*Rom. Subter*., iv. 17),
> which was consecrated to God under their name, and which still retains
> the title, *To the Seven Brothers*. I have no doubt that it was built
> in that place to which the pontiffs in the *Acta*, sec. iv., gave the
> name, *To the Seven Biothanati*, i.e., those cut off by a violent
> death, as Baronius remarks, at the year 138." So far Ruinart: see also
> Tillemont, *Mem. Eccles*., ii. pp. 241 and 595; and the Bollandists,
> *Act. S.S. Funii*, vol. iv. p. 350.

1\. When Adrian had built a palace, and wished to dedicate it by that
wicked ceremonial, and began to seek responses by sacrifices to idols,
and to the demons that dwell in idols, they
replied,<sup>[2](footnote/fn23.htm#P2395_679722.md)</sup> and said: "The
widow Symphorosa, with her seven sons, wounds us day by day in invoking
her God. If she therefore, together with her sons, shall offer
sacrifice, we promise to make good all that you ask." Then Adrian
ordered her to be seized, along with her sons, and advised them in
courteous terms to consent to consent to offer sacrifice to the idols.
To him, however, the blessed Symphorosa answered: "My husband
Getulius,<sup>[3](footnote/fn23.htm#P2396_680193.md)</sup> together with
his brother Amantius, when they were tribunes in thy service, suffered
different punishments for the name of Christ, rather than consent to
sacrifice to idols. and, like good athletes, they overcame thy demons in
death. For, rather than be prevailed on, they chose to be beheaded, and
suffered death: which death, being endured for the name of Christ,
gained them temporal ignominy indeed among men of this earth, but
everlasting honour and glory among the angels; and moving now among
them, and exhibiting<sup>[4](footnote/fn23.htm#P2397_680829.md)</sup>
trophies of their sufferings, they enjoy eternal life with the King
eternal in the heavens."

2\. The Emperor Adrian said to the holy Symphorosa: "Either sacrifice
thou along with thy sons to the omnipotent gods, or else I shall cause
thee to be sacrificed thyself, together with thy sons." The blessed
Symphorosa answered: "And whence is this great good to me, that I should
be deemed worthy along with my sons to be offered as an oblation to God?
"<sup>[5](footnote/fn23.htm#P2399_681324.md)</sup> The Emperor Adrian said:
"I shall cause thee to be sacrificed to my gods." The blessed Symphorosa
replied: "Thy gods cannot take me in sacrifice; but if I am burned for
the name of Christ, my God, I shall rather consume those demons of
thine." The Emperor Adrian said: "Choose thou one of these alternatives:
either sacrifice to my gods, or perish by an evil death." The blessed
Symphorosa replied: "Thou thinkest that my mind can be altered by some
kind of terror; whereas I long to rest with my husband
Getulius,<sup>[6](footnote/fn24.htm#P2400_681930.md)</sup> whom thou didst
put to death for Christ's name." Then the Emperor Adrian ordered her to
be led away to the temple of Hercules, and there first to be beaten with
blows on the cheek, and afterwards to be suspended by the hair. But when
by no argument and by no terror could he divert her from her good
resolution, he ordered her to be thrown into the river with a large
stone fastened to her neck. And her brother Eugenius, principal of the
district of Tiber, picked up her body, and buried it in a suburb of the
same city.

3\. Then, on another day, the Emperor Adrian ordered all her seven sons
to be brought before him in company; and when he had challenged them to
sacrifice to idols, and perceived that they yielded by no means to his
threats and terrors, he ordered seven stakes to be fixed around the
temple of Hercules, and commanded them to be stretched on the blocks
there. And he ordered Crescens, the first, to be transfixed in the
throat; and Julian, the second, to be stabbed in the breast; and
Nemesius, the third, to be struck through the heart; and Primitivus, the
fourth, to be wounded in the navel; and Justin, the fifth, to be struck
through in the back with a sword; and
Stracteus,<sup>[7](footnote/fn24.htm#P2402_683182.md)</sup> the sixth, to
be wounded in the side; and Eugenius, the seventh, to be cleft in twain
from the head downwards.

4\. The next day again the Emperor Adrian came to the temple of
Hercules, and ordered their bodies to be carried off together, and cast
into a deep pit; and the pontiffs gave to that place the name, *To the
Seven Biothanati*.<sup>[8](footnote/fn24.htm#P2404_683634.md)</sup> After
these things the persecution ceased for a year and a half, in which
period the holy bodies of all the martyrs were honoured, and consigned
with all care to tumuli erected for that purpose, and their names are
written in the book of life. The natal day, moreover, of the holy
martyrs of Christ, the blessed Symphorosa and her seven sons, Crescens,
Julian, Nemesius, Primitivus, Justin, Stracteus, and Eugenius, is held
on the 18th July. Their bodies rest on the Tiburtine road, at the eighth
mile-stone from the city, under the kingship of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom is honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
