##  A Declaration of Faith.<sup>[1](footnote/fn2.htm#P249_29601.md)</sup>

------------

There is one God, the Father of the living Word, *who is His* subsistent
Wisdom and Power and Eternal
Image:<sup>[2](footnote/fn2.htm#P252_29970.md)</sup> perfect Begetter of
the perfect *Begotten*, Father of the only-begotten Son. There is one
Lord, Only of the Only,<sup>[3](footnote/fn2.htm#P253_30107.md)</sup> God
of God, Image and Likeness of Deity, Efficient
Word,<sup>[4](footnote/fn2.htm#P254_30188.md)</sup> Wisdom
comprehensive<sup>[5](footnote/fn2.htm#P255_30230.md)</sup> of the
constitution of all things, and Power
formative<sup>[6](footnote/fn2.htm#P256_30301.md)</sup> of the whole
creation, true Son of true Father, Invisible of Invisible, and
Incorruptible of Incorruptible, and Immortal of Immortal and Eternal of
Eternal.<sup>[7](footnote/fn2.htm#P257_30472.md)</sup> And there is One
Holy Spirit, having His
subsistence<sup>[8](footnote/fn2.htm#P258_30549.md)</sup> from God, and
being made manifest<sup>[9](footnote/fn2.htm#P259_30596.md)</sup> by the
Son, to wit to men:<sup>[10](footnote/fn2.htm#P260_30637.md)</sup>
Image<sup>[11](footnote/fn2.htm#P261_30758.md)</sup> of the Son, *Perfect*
Image of the Perfect;<sup>[12](footnote/fn2.htm#P262_30814.md)</sup> Life,
the Cause of the living; Holy Fount; Sanctity, the Supplier, *or
Leader*,<sup>[13](footnote/fn2.htm#P263_31209.md)</sup> of Sanctification;
in whom is manifested God the Father, who is above all and in all, and
God the Son, who is through all. There is a perfect Trinity, in glory
and eternity and sovereignty, neither divided nor
estranged.<sup>[14](footnote/fn2.htm#P264_31445.md)</sup> Wherefore there
is nothing either created or in
servitude<sup>[15](footnote/fn2.htm#P265_31573.md)</sup> in the
Trinity;<sup>[16](footnote/fn2.htm#P266_31603.md)</sup> nor anything
superinduced,<sup>[17](footnote/fn2.htm#P267_31937.md)</sup> as if at some
former period it was non-existent, and at some later period it was
introduced. And thus neither was the Son ever wanting to the Father, nor
the Spirit to the Son;<sup>[18](footnote/fn2.htm#P268_32133.md)</sup> but
without variation and without change, the same Trinity *abideth*
ever.<sup>[19](footnote/fn2.htm#P269_32532.md)</sup>
