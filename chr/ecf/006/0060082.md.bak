##  I.-The Epistle Written by Malchion

In Name of the Synod of Antioch, Against Paul of Samosata.

------------

To Dionysius and Maximus, and to all our fellows in the ministry
throughout the world, both bishops and presbyters and deacons, and to
the whole Catholic Church under heaven, Helenus and Hymenaeus and
Theophilus and Theotecnus and Maximus, Proclus, Nicomas, and Aelianus,
and Paul and Bolanus and Protogenes and Hierax and Eutychius and
Theodorus and Malchion and Lucius, and all the others who are with us,
dwelling in the neighbouring cities and nations, both bishops and
presbyters and deacons, together with the churches of God, send greeting
to our brethren beloved in the Lord.

1\. After some few introductory words, they proceed thus:-We wrote to
many of the bishops, even those who live at a distance, and exhorted
them to give their help in relieving us from this deadly doctrine; among
these, we addressed, for instance, Dionysius, the bishop of Alexandria,
and Firmilian of Cappadocia, those men of blessed name. Of these, the
one wrote to Antioch without even deigning to honour the leader in this
error by addressing him; nor did he write to him in his own name, but to
the whole district,<sup>[1](footnote/fn31.htm#P3107_800008.md)</sup> of
which letter we have also subjoined a copy. And Firmilian, who came
twice in person, condemned the innovations in doctrine, as we who were
present know and bear witness, and as many others know as well as we.
But when he (Paul) promised to give up these opinions, he believed him;
and hoping that, without any reproach to the Word, the matter would be
rightly settled, he postponed his decision; in which action, however, he
was deceived by that denier of his God and Lord, and betrayer of the
faith which he formerly held. And now Firmilian was minded to cross to
Antioch; and he came as far as Tarsus, as having already made trial of
the man's infidel<sup>[2](footnote/fn31.htm#P3108_800716.md)</sup>
iniquity. But when we had just assembled, and were calling for him and
waiting for his arrival, his end came upon him.

2\. After other matters again, they tell us in the following terms of
what manner of life he was:-But there is no need of judging his actions
when he was outside (the Church), when he revolted from the faith and
turned aside to spurious and illegitimate doctrines. Nor need we say any
thing of such matters as this, that, whereas he was formerly poor and
beggarly, having neither inherited a single possession from his fathers,
nor acquired any property by art or by any trade, he has now come to
have excessive wealth by his deeds of iniquity and sacrilege, and by
those means by which he despoils and concusses the brethren, casting the
injured unfairly in their
suit,<sup>[3](footnote/fn31.htm#P3110_801562.md)</sup> and promising to
help them for a price, yet deceiving them all the while and to their
loss, taking advantage of the readiness of those in difficulties to give
in order to get deliverance from what troubled them, and thus supposing
that gain is godliness.<sup>[4](footnote/fn31.htm#P3111_801834.md)</sup>
Neither need I say any thing about his pride and the haughtiness with
which he assumed worldly dignities, and his wishing to be styled
procurator<sup>[5](footnote/fn31.htm#P3112_802031.md)</sup> rather than
bishop, and his strutting through the market-places, and reading letters
and reciting them<sup>[6](footnote/fn31.htm#P3113_802151.md)</sup> as he
walked in public, and his being escorted by multitudes of people going
before him and following him; so that he brought ill-will and hatred on
the faith by his haughty demeanour and by the arrogance of his heart.
Nor shall I say any thing of the quackery which he practises in the
ecclesiastical assemblies, in the way of courting popularity and making
a great parade, and astounding by such arts the minds of the less
sophisticated; nor of his setting up for himself a lofty tribunal and
throne, so unlike a disciple of Christ; nor of his having a
secretum<sup>[7](footnote/fn31.htm#P3114_802832.md)</sup> and calling it by
that name, after the manner of the rulers of this world; nor of his
striking his thigh with his hand and beating the tribunal with his feet;
nor of his censuring and insulting those who did not applaud him nor
shake their handkerchiefs,<sup>[8](footnote/fn31.htm#P3115_803135.md)</sup>
as is done in the theatres, nor bawl out and leap about after the manner
of his partisans, both male and female, who were such disorderly
listeners to him, but chose to hear reverently and modestly as in the
house of God; nor of his unseemly and violent attacks in the
congregation upon the expounders of the Word who have already departed
this life, and his magnifying of himself, not like a bishop, but like a
sophist and juggler; nor of his putting a stop to the psalms sung in
honour of our Lord Jesus Christ, as the recent compositions of recent
men, and preparing women to sing psalms in honour of himself in the
midst of the Church. in the great day of the Paschal festival, which
choristers one might shudder to hear. And besides, he acted on those
bishops and presbyters, who fawned upon him in the neighbouring
districts and cities, to advance the like opinions in their discourses
to their people.

3\. For we may say, to anticipate a little what we intend to write
below, that he does not wish to acknowledge that the Son of God came
down from heaven. And this is a statement which shall not be made to
depend on simple assertion; for it is proved abundantly by those
memoranda which we sent you, and not least by that passage in which he
says that Jesus Christ is from below. And they who sing his praise and
eulogise him among the people, declare that their impious teacher has
come down as an angel from heaven. And such utterances the haughty man
does not check, but is present even when they are made. And then again
there are these women-these adopted
sisters,<sup>[9](footnote/fn31.htm#P3117_804871.md)</sup> as the people of
Antioch call them-who are kept by him and by the presbyters and deacons
with him, whose incurable sins in this and other matters, though he is
cognisant of them, and has convicted them, he connives at concealing,
with the view of keeping the men subservient to himself, and preventing
them, by fear for their own position, from daring to accuse him in the
matter of his impious words and deeds. Besides this, he has made his
followers rich, and for that he is loved and admired by those who set
their hearts on these things. But why should we write of these things?
For, beloved, we know that the bishop and all the
clergy<sup>[10](footnote/fn31.htm#P3118_805650.md)</sup> ought to be an
example in all good works to the people. Nor are we ignorant of the fact
that many have fallen away through introducing these women into their
houses, while others have fallen under suspicion. So that, even although
one should admit that he has been doing nothing disgrace fill in this
matter, yet he ought at least to have avoided the suspicion that springs
out of such a course of conduct. lest perchance some might be offended,
or find inducement to imitate him. For how, then, should any one censure
another, or warn him to beware of yielding to greater familiarity with a
woman, lest perchance he might slip, as it is
written:<sup>[11](footnote/fn31.htm#P3119_806808.md)</sup> if, although he
has dismissed one, he has still retained two with him, and these in the
bloom of their youth, and of fair countenance; and if when he goes away
he takes them with him; and all this, too, while he indulges in luxury
and surfeiting?

4\. And on account of these things all are groaning and lamenting with
themselves; yet they have such a dread of his tyranny and power that
they cannot venture on accusing him. And of these things, as we have
said already, one might take account in the case of a man who held
Catholic sentiments and belonged to our own number; but as to one who
has betrayed<sup>[12](footnote/fn31.htm#P3121_807430.md)</sup> the mystery
(of the faith), and who
swaggers<sup>[13](footnote/fn31.htm#P3122_807539.md)</sup> with the
abominable heresy of Artemas,-for why should we hesitate to disclose his
father?-we consider it unnecessary to exact of him an account for these
things.

5\. *Then at the close of the epistle they add the following words*:-We
have been compelled, therefore, to excommunicate this man, who thus
opposeth God Himself, and refuses submission, and to appoint in his
place another bishop for the Church Catholic, and that, as we trust, by
the providence of God-namely, the son of Demetrianus, a man of blessed
memory, and one who presided over the same Church with distinction in
former times, Domnus by name, a man endowed with all the noble qualities
which become a bishop. And this fact we have communicated to you in
order that ye may write him, and receive letters of
communion<sup>[14](footnote/fn31.htm#P3124_808356.md)</sup> from him. And
that other may write to Artemas, if it please him; and those who think
with Artemas may hold communion with him, if they are so minded.
