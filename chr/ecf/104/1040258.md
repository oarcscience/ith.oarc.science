<span id="v.iv.iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—</span>25.  But the same
mother which brought forth Abel, and Enoch, and Noah, and Abraham,
brought forth also Moses and the prophets who succeeded him till the
coming of our Lord; and the mother which gave birth to them gave birth
also to our apostles and martyrs, and all good Christians.  For all
these that have appeared have been born indeed at different times, but
are included in the society of our people; and it is as citizens of the
same state that they have experienced the labors of this pilgrimage, and
some of them are experiencing them, and others will experience them even
to the end.  Again, the mother who brought forth Cain, and Ham, and
Ishmael, and Esau, brought forth also Dathan and others like him in the
same people; and she who gave birth to them gave birth also to Judas the
false apostle, and Simon Magus, and all the other false Christians who
up to this time have persisted obstinately in their carnal affections,
whether they have been mingled in the unity of the Church, or separated
from it in open schism.  But when men of this kind have the gospel
preached to them, and receive the sacraments at the hand of those who
are spiritual, it is as though Rebecca gave birth to them of her own
womb, as she did to Esau; but when they are produced in the midst of the
people of God through the instrumentality of those who preach the gospel
not sincerely, <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193) Sarah is
indeed the mother, but through Hagar.  So when good spiritual disciples
are produced by the preaching or baptism of those who are carnal, Leah,
indeed, or Rachel, gives birth to them in her right as wife, but from
the womb of a handmaid.  But when good and faithful disciples are born
of those who are spiritual in the gospel, and either attain to the
development of spiritual age, or do not cease to strive in that
direction, or are only deterred from doing so by want of power, these
are born like Isaac from the womb of Sarah, or Jacob from the womb of
Rebecca, in the new life and the new covenant.
