<span id="v.v.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—</span>12.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.vi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"This being the case, brethren, what perversity must it be, that he who
is guilty through his own sins should make another free from guilt, when
the Lord Jesus Christ says, ‘Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit,
but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit:  do men gather grapes of
thorns?’ <span id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974)    And again:  ‘A
good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good
things:  and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil
things.’" <span id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975)

<span id="v.v.iv.vi-p4"></span>13.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.vi-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  No man, even
though he be not guilty through his own sins, can make his neighbor free
from sin, because he is not God.  Otherwise, if we were to expect that
out of the innocence of the baptizer should be produced the innocence of
the baptized, then each will be the more innocent in proportion as he
may have found a more innocent person by whom to be baptized; and will
himself be the less innocent in proportion as he by whom he is baptized
is less innocent.  And if the man who baptizes happens to entertain
hatred against another man, this will also be imputed to him who is
baptized.  Why, therefore, does the wretched man hasten to be
baptized,—that his own sins may be forgiven him, or that those of others
may be reckoned against him?  Is he like a merchant ship, to discharge
one burden, and to take on him another?  But by the good tree and its
good fruit, and the corrupt tree and its evil fruit, we are wont to
understand men and their works, as is consequently shown in those other
words which you also quoted:  "A good man, out of the good treasure of
his heart, bringeth forth good things:  and an evil man, out of the evil
treasure, bringeth forth evil things."  But when a man preaches the word
of God, or administers the sacraments of God, he does not, if he is a
bad man, preach or minister out of his own treasure; but he will be
counted among those of whom it is said, "Whatsoever they bid you
observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works:"  for
they bid you observe what is God’s, but their works are their own.  For
if it is as you say, that is, if the fruit of those who baptize consist
in the baptized persons themselves, you declare a great woe against
Africa, if a young Optatus has sprung up for every one that Optatus
baptized.
