<span id="iv.x.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—This Last Expression
Misunderstood by Some.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxvii-p2"></span>For no attention should be paid to the
ravings of men who think that *nothing* should be understood to mean
*something*, and moreover think to compel any one to vanity of this kind
on the ground that *nothing* is placed at the end of the sentence. 
Therefore, they say, it was made, and because it was made, nothing is
itself something.  They have lost their senses by zeal in contradicting,
and do not understand that it makes no difference whether it be said: 
"Without Him was made nothing," or "without Him nothing was made."  For
even if the order were the last mentioned, they could nevertheless say,
that nothing is itself something because it was made.  For in the case
of what is in truth something, what difference does it make if it be
said "Without him a house was made," so long as it is understood that
something was made without him, which something is a house?  So also
because it is said:  "Without Him was made nothing," since nothing is
assuredly not anything, when it is truly and properly spoken, it makes
no difference whether it be said:  "Without Him was made nothing or
Without Him nothing was made," or "nothing was made."  But who cares to
speak with men who can say of this very expression of mine "It makes no
difference," "Therefore it makes some difference, for nothing itself is
something?"  But those whose brains are not addled, see it as a thing
most manifest that this something is to be understood when it says "It
makes no difference," as when I say "It matters in no respect."  But
these, if they should say to any one, "What hast thou done?" and he
should reply that he has done nothing, would, according to this mode of
disputation, falsely accuse him saying, "Thou hast done something,
therefore, because thou hast done nothing; for nothing is itself
something."  But they have also the Lord Himself placing this word at
the end of a sentence, when He says:  "And in secret have I spoken
nothing."  <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101)   Let them read,
therefore, and be silent. <span id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102)

<span id="iv.x.xxvii-p4"></span> It is difficult for us to understand
why Augustin should have thought it worth while to refute so elaborately
an argument so puerile.  But it is his way to be prolix in such
matters.—A.H.N.
