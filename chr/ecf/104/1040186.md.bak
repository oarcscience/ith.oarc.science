id="iv.x.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—How This May Suffice for Correcting
the Manichæans.</span>

<span id="iv.x.iv-p2"></span>But for the sake of those who, not being
able to understand that all nature, that is, every spirit and every
body, is naturally good, are moved by the iniquity of spirit and the
mortality of body, and on this account endeavor to bring in another
nature of wicked spirit and mortal body, which God did not make, we
determine thus to bring to their <span id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span
id="iv.x.iv-Page_352"></span>understanding what we say can be brought. 
For they acknowledge that no good thing can exist save from the highest
and true God, which also is true and suffices for correcting them, if
they are willing to give heed.
