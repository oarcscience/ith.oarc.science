<span id="v.v.iv.lxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 64.—</span>143.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxiv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"‘Blessed are the meek:  for they shall inherit the earth.’  You
therefore, not being meek, have lost both heaven and earth alike."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxiv-p2"></span>144.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxiv-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Again and again
you may hear the Lord saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole
earth." <span id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157)   How is it, then,
that those men have not lost heaven and earth, who, in order to avoid
communicating with all the nations of the earth, despise the words of
Him that sitteth in heaven?  For, in proof of your meekness, it is not
your words but the cudgels of the Circumcelliones which should be
examined.  You will say, What has that to do with us?  Just as though we
were making the remark with any other object except to extract that
answer from you.  For the reason that your schism is a valid charge
against you is that you do not allow that you are chargeable with
another’s sin, whereas you have separated from us for no other reason
but that you charge us with the sins of other men.
