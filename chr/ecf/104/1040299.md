<span id="v.iv.vi.i-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—</span>1.  The comparison of the
Church with Paradise <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) shows us
that men may indeed receive her baptism outside her pale, but that no
one outside can either receive or retain the salvation of eternal
happiness.  For, as the words of Scripture testify, the streams from the
fountain of Paradise flowed copiously even beyond its bounds.  Record
indeed is made of their names; and through what countries they flow, and
that they are situated beyond the limits of Paradise, is known to
all; <span id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) and yet in Mesopotamia,
and in Egypt, to which countries those rivers extended, there is not
found that blessedness of life which is recorded in Paradise. 
Accordingly, though the waters of Paradise are found beyond its
boundaries, yet its happiness is in Paradise alone.  So, therefore, the
baptism of the Church may exist outside, but the gift of the life of
happiness is found alone within the Church, which has been founded on a
rock, which has received the keys of binding and loosing. <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md)   "She it is alone who holds as her
privilege the whole power of her Bridegroom and Lord;" <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) by virtue of which power as bride,
she can bring forth sons even of handmaids.  And these, if they be not
high-minded, shall be called into the lot of the inheritance; but if
they be high-minded, they shall remain outside.
