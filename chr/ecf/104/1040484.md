<span id="v.v.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—</span>29.  Wherefore, my
beloved brethren, though that error is exposed and overcome in many
ways, and dare not oppose the truth on any show of reason whatsoever,
but only with the unblushing obstinacy of impudence; yet, not to load
your memory with a multitude of proofs, I would have you bear in mind
this one action of the followers of Maximianus, confront them with this
one fact, thrust this in their teeth, to make them their treacherous
tongues, destroy their calumny with this, as it were a three-pronged
dart destroying a three-headed monster.  They charge us with betrayal of
the sacred books; they charge us with persecution; they charge us with
false baptism:  to all their charges make the same answer about the
followers of Maximianus.  For they think that the proofs are lost which
show that their predecessors gave the sacred volumes to the flames; but
this at least they cannot hide, that they have received with unimpaired
honors those who were stained with the sacrilege of schism.  Also they
think that those most violent persecutions are hidden, which they direct
against any who oppose them whenever they are able; but whilst spiritual
persecution surpasses bodily persecution, they received with
undiminished honors the followers of Maximianus, whom they themselves
persecuted in the body, and of whom they themselves said, "Their feet
are swift to shed blood;" <span id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md) and
this at any rate they cannot hide.
