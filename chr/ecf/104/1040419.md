<span id="v.iv.ix.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—</span>38.  Zozimus of
Tharassa <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) said:  "When a
revelation has been made of the truth, error must give way to truth;
inasmuch as Peter also, who before was wont to circumcise, gave way to
Paul when he declared the truth." <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xx-p4"></span>39.  The answer is:  This may also be
considered as the expression of our judgment too, and this is just what
has been done in respect of this question of baptism.  For after that
the truth had been more clearly revealed, error gave way to truth, when
that most wholesome custom was further confirmed by the authority of a
plenary Council.  It is well, however, that they so constantly bear in
mind that it was possible even for Peter, the chief of the apostles, to
have been at one time minded otherwise than the truth required; which we
believe, without any disrespect to Cyprian, to have been the case with
him, and that with all our love for Cyprian, for it is not right that he
should be loved with greater love than Peter.
