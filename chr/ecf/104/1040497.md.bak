<span id="v.v.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—</span>23.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.x-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Did the apostle persecute any one? or did Christ betray any one?"

<span id="v.v.iv.x-p2"></span>24.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.x-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I might indeed say
that Satan himself was worse than all wicked men; and yet the apostle
delivered a <span id="page_535">p. 535</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.x-Page_535"></span>man over to him for the destruction of the
flesh, that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus. <span id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md)   And in the same way
he delivered over others, of whom he says, "Whom I have delivered unto
Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme." <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md)   And the Lord Christ drove out the
impious merchants from the temple with scourges; in which connection we
also find advanced the testimony of Scripture, where it says, "The zeal
of Thine house hath eaten me up." <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md)   So that we do find the apostle
delivering over to condemnation, and Christ a persecutor.  All this I
might say, and put you into no small heat and perturbation, so that you
would be compelled to inquire, not into the complaints of those who
suffer, but into the intention of those who cause the suffering.  But do
not trouble yourself about this; I do not say this.  But I do say that
it has nothing to do with the seed of Abraham, which is in all nations,
if anything has been done to you which ought not to have been done,
perhaps by the chaff among the harvest of the Lord, which in spite of
this is found among all nations.  Do you therefore render an account of
your separation.  But first, consider what kind of men you have among
you, with whom you would not wish to be reproached; and see how unjustly
you act, when you cast in our teeth the acts of other men, even if you
proved what you assert.  Therefore it will be found that there is no
ground for your separation.
