<span id="iv.v.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Actions to Be Judged of from Their
Motive, Not from Externals.  Manichæan Abstinence to Be Tried by This
Principle.</span>

<span id="iv.v.xv-p2"></span>27.  Having every day in your mouth these
blasphemies which come from your heart, you ought not to continue
holding up the symbol of the mouth as something wonderful, to ensnare
the ignorant.  But perhaps you think the symbol of the mouth excellent
and admirable because you do not eat flesh or drink wine.  But what is
your end in this?  For according as the end we have in view in our
actions, on account of which we do whatever we do, is not only not
culpable but also praiseworthy, so only can our actions merit any
praise.  If the end we have regard to in any performance is unlawful and
blameworthy, the performance itself will be unhesitatingly condemned as
improper.

<span id="iv.v.xv-p3"></span>28.  We are told of Catiline that he could
bear cold, thirst, and hunger. <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md)  
This the vile miscreant had in common with our apostles.  What then
distinguishes the parricide from our apostles but the precisely opposite
end which he followed?  He bore these things in order to gratify his
fierce and ungoverned passions; they, on the other hand, in order to
restrain these passions and subdue them to reason.  You often say, when
you are told of the great number of Catholic virgins, a she-mule is a
virgin.  This, indeed, is said in ignorance of the Catholic system, and
is not applicable.  Still, what you mean is that this continence is
worthless unless it leads, on right principles, to an end of high
excellence.  Catholic Christians might also compare your abstinence from
wine and flesh to that of cattle and many small birds, as likewise of
countless sorts of worms.  But, not <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>
<span id="iv.v.xv-Page_77"></span>to be impertinent like you, I will not
make this comparison prematurely, but will first examine your end in
what you do.  For I suppose I may safely take it as agreed on, that in
such customs the end is the thing to look to.  Therefore, if your end is
to be frugal and to restrain the appetite which finds gratification in
eating and drinking, I assent and approve.  But this is not the case.

<span id="iv.v.xv-p5"></span>29.  Suppose, what is quite possible, that
there is one so frugal and sparing in his diet, that, instead of
gratifying his appetite or his palate, he refrains from eating twice in
one day, and at supper takes a little cabbage moistened and seasoned
with lard, just enough to keep down hunger; and quenches his thirst,
from regard to his health, with two or three draughts of pure wine; and
this is his regular diet:  whereas another of different habits never
takes flesh or wine, but makes an agreeable repast at two o’clock on
rare and foreign vegetables, varied with a number of courses, and well
sprinkled with pepper, and sups in the same style towards night; and
drinks honey-vinegar, mead, raisin-wine, and the juices of various
fruits, no bad imitation of wine, and even surpassing it in sweetness;
and drinks not for thirst but for pleasure; and makes this provision for
himself daily, and feasts in this sumptuous style, not because he
requires it, but only gratifying his taste;—which of these two do you
regard as living most abstemiously in food and drink?  You cannot surely
be so blind as not to put the man of the little lard and wine above this
glutton!

<span id="iv.v.xv-p6"></span>30.  This is the true view; but your
doctrine sounds very differently.  For one of your elect distinguished
by the three symbols may live like the second person in this
description, and though he may be reproved by one or two of the more
sedate, he cannot be condemned as abusing the symbols.  But should he
sup with the other person, and moisten his lips with a morsel of rancid
bacon, or refresh them with a drink of spoilt wine, he is pronounced a
transgressor of the symbol, and by the judgment of your founder is
consigned to hell, while you, though wondering, must assent.  Will you
not discard these errors?  Will you not listen to reason?  Will you not
offer some little resistance to the force of habit?  Is not such
doctrine most unreasonable?  Is it not insanity?  Is it not the greatest
absurdity that one, who stuffs and loads his stomach every day to
gratify his appetite with mushrooms, rice, truffles, cake, mead, pepper,
and assafœtida, and who fares thus every day, cannot be convicted of
transgressing the three symbols, that is, the rule of sanctity; whereas
another, who seasons his dish of the commonest herbs with some smoky
morsel of meat, and takes only so much of this as is needed for the
refreshment of his body, and drinks three cups of wine for the sake of
keeping in health, should, for exchanging the former diet for this, be
doomed to certain punishment?
