what we may call the genuine <span id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md)
Donatists, whose bishop is Primianus at Carthage, there is now no
controversy on this point.  For God willed that it should be ended by
means of the followers of Maximianus, that they should be compelled by
the precedent of his case to acknowledge what they would not allow at
the persuasion of Christian charity.  But this brings us to consider
next, whether those men do not seem to have something to say for
themselves, who refuse communion with the party of Primianus, contending
that in their body there remains greater sincerity of Donatism, just in
proportion to the paucity of their numbers.  And even if these were only
the party of Maximianus, we should not be justified in despising their
salvation.  How much more, then, are we bound to consider it, when we
find that this same party of Donatus is split up into many most minute
fractions, all which small sections of the body blame the one much
larger portion which has Primianus for its head, because they receive
the baptism of the followers of Maximianus; while each endeavors to
maintain that it is the sole receptacle of true baptism, which exists
nowhere else, neither in the whole of the world where the Catholic
Church extends itself, nor in that larger main body of the Donatists,
nor even in the other minute sections, but only in itself.  Whereas, if
all these fragments would listen not to the voice of man, but to the
most unmistakable manifestation of the truth, and would be willing to
curb the fiery temper of their own perversity, they would return from
their own barrenness, not indeed to the main body of Donatus, a mere
fragment of which they are a smaller fragment, but to the never-failing
fruitfulness of the root of the Catholic Church.  For all of them who
are not against us are for us; but when they gather not with us, they
scatter abroad.
