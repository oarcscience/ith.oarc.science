<span id="v.v.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>10.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.v-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said:  "For everything
consists of an origin and root; and if it have not something for a head,
it is nothing:  nor does anything well receive second birth, unless it
be born again of good seed."

<span id="v.v.iv.v-p2"></span>11.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.v-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Why will you put
yourself forward in the room of Christ, when you will not place yourself
under Him?  He is the origin, and root, and head of him who is being
born, and in Him we feel no fear, as we must in any man, whoever he may
be, lest he should prove to be false and of abandoned character, and we
should be found to be sprung from an abandoned source, growing from an
abandoned root, united to an abandoned head.  For what man can feel
secure about a man, when it is written, "Cursed be the man that trusteth
in man?" <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md)   But the seed of
which we are born again is the word of God, that is, the gospel.  Whence
the apostle says, "For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the
gospel." <span id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md)   And yet he allows
even those to preach the gospel who were preaching it not in purity, and
rejoices in their preaching; <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md)
because, although they were preaching it not in purity, but seeking
their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s, <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) yet the gospel which they preached
was pure.  And the Lord had said of certain of like character,
"Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not yet
after their works:  for they say, and do not." <span
id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md)   If, therefore, what is in itself
pure is preached in purity, then the preacher himself also, in that he
is a partner with the word, has his share in begetting the believer; but
if he himself be not regenerate, and yet what he preaches be pure, then
the believer is born not from the barrenness of the minister but from
the fruitfulness of the word.
