<span id="iv.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—We are Joined Inseparably to God
by Christ and His Spirit.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xv-p2"></span>22.  Let this same Paul tell us who is
this Christ Jesus our Lord.  "To them that are called," he says, "we
preach Christ the virtue of God, and the wisdom of God." <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md)   And does not Christ Himself say, "I am
the truth?" <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md)   If, then, we ask what
it is to live well,—that is, to strive after happiness by living
well,—it must assuredly be to love virtue, to love wisdom, to love
truth, and to love with all the heart, with all the soul, and with all
the mind; virtue which is inviolable and immutable, wisdom which never
gives place to folly, truth which knows no change or variation from its
uniform character.  Through this the Father Himself is seen; for it is
said, "No man cometh unto the Father but by me."  To this we cleave by
sanctification.  For when sanctified we burn with full and perfect love,
which is the only security for our not turning away from God, and for
our being conformed to Him rather than to this world; for "He has
predestinated us," says the same apostle, "that we should be conformed
to the image of His Son." <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md)

<span id="iv.iv.xv-p6"></span>23.  It is through love, then, that we
become conformed to God; and by this conformation, and configuration,
and circumcision from this world we are not confounded with the things
which are properly subject to us.  And this is done by the Holy Spirit. 
"For hope," he says, "does not confound us; for the love of God is shed
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us." <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md)   But we could not possibly be restored
to perfection by the Holy Spirit, unless He Himself continued always
perfect and immutable.  And this plainly could not be unless He were of
the nature and of the very substance of God, who alone is always
possessed of immutability and invariableness.  "The creature," it is
affirmed, not by me but by Paul, "has been made subject to
vanity." <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md)   And what is subject to
vanity is unable to separate us from vanity, and to unite us to the
truth.  But the Holy Spirit does this for us.  He is therefore no
creature.  For whatever is, must be either God or the creature.
