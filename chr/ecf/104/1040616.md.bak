<span id="v.v.v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—</span>22.  For perhaps some one
of you will say to me, All these things which he said against you he
wished to have force for this purpose, that he might take away your
character, and through you the character of <span id="page_605">p.
605</span> <span id="v.v.v.xix-Page_605"></span>those with whom you hold
communion, that neither they themselves, nor those whom you endeavor to
bring over to your communion, may hold you to be of any further
importance.  But, in deciding whether he has given no answer to the
words of your epistle, we must look at them in the light of the passage
in which he proposed them for consideration.  Let us then do so:  let us
look at his writings in the light of that very passage.  Passing over,
therefore, the passage in which I sought to introduce my subject to the
reader, and to ignore those few prefatory words of his, which were
rather insulting than revelant to the subject under discussion, I go on
to say, "He says, ‘What we look for is the conscience of the giver, to
cleanse that of the recipient.’  But supposing the conscience of the
giver is concealed from view, and perhaps defiled with sin, how will it
be able to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, if, as he says,
‘what we look for is the conscience of the giver, to cleanse that of the
recipient?’  For if he should say that it makes no matter to the
recipient what amount of evil may be concealed from view in the
conscience of the giver, perhaps that ignorance may have such a degree
of efficacy as this, that a man cannot be defiled by the guilt of the
conscience of him from whom he receives baptism, so long as he is
unaware of it.  Let it then be granted that the guilty conscience of his
neighbor cannot defile a man so long as he is unaware of it; but is it
therefore clear that it can further cleanse him from his own guilt? 
Whence then is a man to be cleansed who receives baptism, when the
conscience of the giver is polluted without the knowledge of him who is
to receive it, especially when he goes on to say, ‘For he who receives
faith from the faithless receives not faith but guilt?’" <span
