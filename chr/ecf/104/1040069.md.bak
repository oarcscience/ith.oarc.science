<span id="iv.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Three Moral Symbols Devised by the
Manichæans for No Good.</span>

<span id="iv.v.xii-p2"></span>19.  Now that I have shown, as I think,
how much darkness and error is in your opinions about good and evil
things in general, let us examine now those three symbols which you
extol so highly, and boast of as excellent observances.  What then are
those three symbols?  That of the mouth, that of the hands, and that of
the breast.  What does this mean?  That man, we are told, should be pure
and innocent in mouth, in hands, and in breast.  But what if he sins
with eyes, ears, or nose?  What if he hurts some one with his heels, or
perhaps kills him?  How can he be reckoned criminal when he has not
sinned with mouth, hands, or breast?  But, it is replied, by the mouth
we are to understand all the organs of sense in the head; by the hands,
all bodily actions; by the breast, all lustful tendencies.  To what,
then, do you assign blasphemies?  To the mouth or to the hand?  For
blasphemy is an action of the tongue.  And if all actions are to be
classed under one head, why should you join together the actions of the
hands and the feet, and not those of the tongue.  Do you wish to
separate the action <span id="page_75">p. 75</span> <span
id="iv.v.xii-Page_75"></span>of the tongue, as being for the purpose of
expressing something, from actions which are not for this purpose, so
that the symbol of the hands should mean abstinence from all evil
actions which are not for the purpose of expressing something?  But
then, what if some one sins by expressing something with his hands, as
is done in writing or in some significant gesture?  This cannot be
assigned to the tongue and the mouth, for it is done by the hands.  When
you have three symbols of the mouth, the hands, and the breast, it is
quite inadmissible to charge against the mouth sins found in the hands. 
And if you assign action in general to the hands, there is no reason for
including under this the action of the feet and not that of the tongue. 
Do you see how the desire of novelty, with its attendant error, lands
you in great difficulties?  For you find it impossible to include
purification of all sins in these three symbols, which you set forth as
a kind of new classification.
