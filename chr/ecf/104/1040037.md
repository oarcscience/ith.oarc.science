<span id="iv.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Harmony of the Old and New
Testaments.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xviii-p2"></span>26.  I will briefly set forth the
manner of life according to these virtues, one by one, after I have
brought forward, as I promised, passages from the Old Testament parallel
to those I have been quoting from the New Testament.  For is Paul alone
in saying that we should be joined to God so that there should be
nothing between to separate us?  Does not the prophet say the same most
aptly and concisely in the words, "It is good for me to cleave to God?"
 <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64)   Does not this one word *cleave*
express all that the apostle says at length about love?  And do not the
words, It is good, point to the apostle’s statement, "All things issue
in good to them that love God?"  Thus in one clause and in two words the
prophet sets forth the power and the fruit of love.

<span id="iv.iv.xviii-p4"></span>27.  And as the apostle says that the
Son of God is the virtue of God and the wisdom of God,—virtue being
understood to refer to action, and wisdom to teaching (as in the gospel
these two things are expressed in the words, "All things were made by
Him," which belongs to action and virtue; and then, referring to
teaching and the knowledge of the truth, he says, "The life was the
light of men" <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65) ),—could anything
agree better with these passages than what is said in the Old
Testament <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66) of wisdom, "She reaches
from end to end in strength, and orders all things sweetly?"  For
reaching in strength expresses virtue, while ordering sweetly expresses
skill and method.  But if this seems obscure, see what follows:  "And of
all," he says, "God loved her; for she teaches the knowledge of God, and
chooses His works."  Nothing more is found here about action; for
choosing works is not the same as working, so this refers to teaching. 
There remains action to correspond with the virtue, to complete the
truth we wish to prove.  Read then what comes next:  "But if," he says,
"the possession which is desired in life is honorable, what is more
honorable than wisdom, which works all things?"  Could anything be
brought forward more striking or more distinct than this, or even more
fully expressed?  Or, if you wish more, hear another passage of the same
meaning.  "Wisdom," he says, "teaches sobriety, and justice, and
virtue."  <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67)   Sobriety refers, I
think, to the knowledge of the truth, or to teaching; justice and virtue
to work and action.  And I know nothing comparable to these two things,
that is, to efficiency in action and sobriety in contemplation, which
the virtue of God and the wisdom of God, that is, the Son of God, gives
to them that love Him, when the same prophet goes on to show their
value; for it is thus stated:  "Wisdom teaches sobriety, and justice,
and virtue, than which nothing is more useful in life to man." <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68)

<span id="iv.iv.xviii-p9"></span>28.  Perhaps some may think that those
passages do not refer to the Son of God.  What, then, is taught in the
following words:  "She displays the nobility of her birth, having her
dwelling with God?" <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69)   To what does
birth refer but to parentage?  And does not dwelling with the Father
claim and assert equality?  Again, as Paul says that the Son of God is
the wisdom of God, <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70) and as the Lord
Himself says, "No man knoweth the Father save the only-begotten
Son," <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71) what could be more concordant
than those words of the prophet:  "With Thee is wisdom which knows Thy
works, which was present at the time of Thy making the world, and knew
what would be pleasing in Thine eyes?" <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72)   And as Christ is called the truth,
which is also taught by His being called the brightness of the
Father <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73) (for there is nothing round
about the sun but its brightness which is produced from it), what is
there in the Old Testament more plainly and obviously in accordance with
this than the words, "Thy truth is round about Thee?" <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74)   Once more, Wisdom herself says in the
gospel, "No man cometh unto the Father but by me;" <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75) and the prophet says, "Who knoweth Thy
mind, unless Thou givest wisdom?" and a little after, "The things
pleasing to Thee men have learned, and have been healed by
wisdom." <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76)

<span id="iv.iv.xviii-p18"></span>29.  Paul says, "The love of God is
shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto
us;" <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77) and the prophet says, "The
Holy Spirit of knowledge will shun guile." <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78)   For where there is guile there is no
love.  Paul says that we are "conformed to the image of the Son of
God;" <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79) and the <span id="page_50">p.
50</span> <span id="iv.iv.xviii-Page_50"></span>prophet says, "The light
of Thy countenance is stamped upon us." <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80)   Paul teaches that the Holy Spirit is
God, and therefore is no creature; and the prophet says, "Thou sendest
Thy Spirit from the higher." <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81)   For
God alone is the highest, than whom nothing is higher.  Paul shows that
the Trinity is one God, when he says, "To Him be glory;" <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82) and in the Old Testament it is said,
"Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God." <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83)

<span id="iv.iv.xviii-p8"></span> *Retract*. i. 7, § 3:—"The quotation
from the book of Wisdom is from my manuscript, where the reading is,
‘Wisdom teaches sobriety, justice, and virtue.’  From these words I have
made some remarks true in themselves, but occasioned by a false
reading.  It is perfectly true that wisdom teaches truth of
contemplation, as I have explained sobriety; and excellence of action,
which is the meaning I give to justice and virtue.  And the reading in
better manuscripts has the same meaning:  ‘It teaches sobriety, and
wisdom, and justice, and virtue.’  These are the names given by the
Latin translator to the four virtues which philosophers usually speak
about.  Sobriety is for temperance, wisdom for prudence, virtue for
fortitude, and justice only has its own name.  It was long after that we
found these virtues called by their proper names in the Greek text of
this book of Wisdom."
