<span id="v.iv.viii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—</span>32.  Felix of
Bagai <span id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652) said:  "As when the
blind leads the blind, both fall into the ditch, <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653) so when a heretic baptizes a
heretic, both fall together into death."

<span id="v.iv.viii.xix-p4"></span>33.  This is true, but it does not
follow that what he adds is true.  "And therefore," he says, "the
heretic must be baptized and brought to life, lest we who are alive
should hold communion with the dead." <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654)   Were they not dead who said, "Let
us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die?" <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655) for they did not believe in the
resurrection of the dead.  Those then who were corrupted by their evil
communications, and followed them, were not they likewise falling with
them into the pit?  And yet among them there were men to whom the
apostle was writing as being already baptized; nor would they,
therefore, if they were corrected, be baptized afresh.  Does not the
same apostle say, "To be carnally-minded is death?" <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656) and certainly the covetous, the
deceivers, the robbers, in the midst of whom Cyprian himself was
groaning, were carnally-minded.  What then?  Did the dead hurt him who
was living in unity?  Or who would say, that because such men had or
gave the baptism of Christ, that it was therefore violated by their
iniquities?

<span id="v.iv.viii.xix-p2"></span> Bagai, in church province of
Numidia.  See on I. 5. 7.  Among the many of the name of Felix in the
letters of Cyprian, lvi., lvii., lxvii; title 1, 6, lxx., lxxvi. *bis*,
lxxvii., lxxix., title and text, it would be unsafe to decide a sure
reference to distinguish between this and the other bishops of the same
cognomen in this council.
