<span id="v.iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—</span>18.  But who can fail
to understand what they may be saying in their hearts?  "What then are
we to do," say they, "with those whom we have already rebaptized?" 
Return with them to the Church.  Bring those whom you have wounded to be
healed by the medicine of peace:  bring those whom you have slain to be
brought to life again by the life of charity.  Brotherly union has great
power in propitiating God.  "If two of you," says our Lord, "shall agree
on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for
them." <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257)   If for two men who
agree, how much more for two communities?  Let us throw ourselves
together on our knees <span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xiii-Page_434"></span>before the Lord.  Do you share with us
our unity; let us share with you your contrition and let charity cover
the multitude of sins. <span id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258)   Seek
counsel from the blessed Cyprian himself.  See how much he considered to
depend upon the blessing of unity, from which he did not sever himself
to avoid the communion of those who disagreed with him; how, though he
considered that those who were baptized outside the communion of the
Church had no true baptism, he was yet willing to believe that, by
simple admission into the Church, they might, merely in virtue of the
bond of unity, be admitted to a share in pardon.  For thus he solved the
question which he proposed to himself in writing as follows to
Jubaianus:  "But some will say, ‘What then will become of those who, in
times past, coming to the Church from heresy, were admitted without
baptism?’  The Lord is able of His mercy to grant pardon, and not to
sever from the gifts of His Church those who, being out of simplicity
admitted to the Church, have in the Church fallen asleep." <span
