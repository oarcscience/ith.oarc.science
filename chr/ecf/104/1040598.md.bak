<span id="v.v.v.i-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—</span>1.  Being able to read,
Petilianus, I have read your letter, in which you have shown with
sufficient clearness that, in supporting the party of Donatus against
the Catholic Church, you have neither been able to say anything to the
purpose, nor been allowed to hold your tongue.  What violent emotions
did you endure, what a storm of feelings surged within your heart, on
reading the answer which I made, with all possible brevity and
clearness, to that portion of your letter which alone at that time had
come into my hands!  For you saw that the truth which we maintain and
defend was confirmed with such strength of argument, and illustrated
with such abundant light, that you could not find anything which could
be said against it, whereby the charges which we make might be refuted. 
You observed, also, that the attention of many who had read it was fixed
on you, since they desired to know what you would say, what you would
do, how you would escape from the difficulty, how you would make your
way out of the strait in which the word of God had encompassed you. 
Hereupon you, when you ought to have shown contempt for the opinion of
the foolish ones, and to have gone on to adopt sound and truthful
sentiments, preferred rather to do what Scripture has foretold of men
like you:  "Thou hast loved evil more than good, and lying rather than
to speak righteousness." <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md)  
Just as if I in turn were willing to recompense unto you railing for
railing; in which case, what should we be but two evil speakers, so that
those who read our words would either preserve their self-respect by
throwing us aside with abhorrence, or eagerly devour what we wrote to
gratify their malice?  For my own part, since I answer every one,
whether in writing or by word of mouth, even when I have been attacked
with insulting accusations, in such language as the Lord puts in my
mouth, restraining and crushing the stings of empty indignation in the
interests of my hearer or reader, I do not strive to prove myself
superior to my adversary by abusing him, but rather to be a source of
health in him by convicting him of his error.

<span id="v.v.v.i-p3"></span>2.  For if those who take into
consideration what you have written have any feelings whatsoever, how
did it serve you in the cause which is at issue between us respecting
the Catholic communion and the party of Donatus, that, leaving a matter
which was in a certain sense of public interest, you should have been
led by private animosity to attack the life of an individual with
malicious revilings, just as though that individual were the question in
debate?  Did you think so badly, I do not say of Christians, but of the
whole human race, as not to suppose that your writings might come into
the hands of some prudent men, who would lay aside all thoughts of
individuals like us, and inquire rather into the question which was at
issue between us, and pay heed, not to who and what we were, but to what
we might be able to advance in defense of the truth or against error? 
You should have paid respect to these men’s judgment, you should have
guarded yourself against their censure, lest they should think that you
could find nothing to say, unless you set before yourself some one whom
you might abuse by any means within your power.  But one may see by the
thoughtlessness and foolishness of some men, who listen eagerly to <span
id="page_597">p. 597</span> <span id="v.v.v.i-Page_597"></span>the
quarrels of any learned disputants, that while they take notice of the
eloquence wherewith you lavish your abuse, they do not perceive with
what truth you are refuted.  At the same time, I think your object
partly was that I might be driven, by the necessity of defending myself,
to desert the very cause which I had undertaken; and that so, while
men’s attention was turned to the words of opponents who were engaged
not in disputation, but in quarrelling, the truth might be obscured,
which you are so afraid should come to light and be well known among
men.  What therefore was I to do in opposing such a design as this,
except to keep strictly to my subject, neglecting rather my own defense,
praying withal that no personal calumny may lead me to withdraw from
it?  I will exalt the house of my God, whose honor I have loved, with
the tribute of a faithful servant’s voice, but myself I will humiliate
and hold of no account.  "I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of
my God, than to dwell in the tents of heretics." <span
id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md)   I will therefore turn my
discourse from you, Petilianus, for a time, and direct it rather to
those whom you have endeavored to turn away from me by your revilings,
as though my endeavor rather were that men should be converted unto me,
and not rather with me unto God.
