<span id="iv.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Harmony of the Old and New
Testament on the Precepts of Charity. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) </span>

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p3"></span>14.  Come now, let us examine, or rather
let us take notice,—for it is obvious and can be seen, at once,—whether
the authority of the Old Testament too agrees with those statements
taken from the gospel and the apostle.  What need to speak of the first
statement, when it is clear to all that it is a quotation from the law
given by Moses?  For it is there written, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind."
 <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md)   And not to go farther for a
passage of the Old Testament to compare with that of the apostle, he has
himself added one.  For after saying that no tribulation, no distress,
no persecution, no pressure of bodily want, no peril, no sword,
separates us from the love of Christ, he immediately adds, "As it is
written, For Thy sake we are in suffering all the day long; we are
accounted as sheep for the slaughter." <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md)   The Manichæans are in the habit of
saying that this is an interpolation,—so unable are they to reply, that
they are forced in their extremity to say this.  But every one can see
that this is all that is left for men to say when it is proved that they
are wrong.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p6"></span>15.  And yet I ask them if they deny that
this is said in the Old Testament, or if they hold that the passage in
the Old Testament does not agree with that of the apostle.  For the
first, the books will prove it; and as for the second, those
prevaricators who fly off at a tangent will be brought to agree with me,
if they will only reflect a little and consider what is said, or else I
will press upon them the opinion of those who judge impartially.  For
what could agree more harmoniously than these passages?  For
tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, cause
great suffering to man while in this life.  So all these words are
implied in the single quotation from the law, where it is said, "For Thy
sake we are in suffering." <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md)   The
only other thing is the sword, which does not inflict a painful life,
but removes whatever life it meets with.  Answering to this are the
words, "We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."  And love could
not have been more plainly expressed than by the words, "For Thy sake." 
Suppose, then, that this testimony is not found in the Apostle Paul, but
is quoted by me, must you not prove, you heretic, either that this is
not written in the old law, or that it does not harmonize with the
apostle?  And if you dare not say either of these things (for you are
shut up by the reading of the manuscript, which will show that it is
written, and by common sense, which sees that nothing could agree better
with what is said by the apostle), why do you imagine that there is any
force in accusing the Scriptures of being corrupted?  And once more,
what will you reply to a man who says to you, This is what I understand,
this is my view, this is my belief, and I read these books only because
I see that everything in them agrees with the Christian faith?  Or tell
me at once if you will venture deliberately to tell me to the face that
we are not to believe that the apostles and martyrs are spoken of as
having endured great sufferings for Christ’s sake, and as having been
accounted by their persecutors as sheep for the slaughter?  If you
cannot say this, why should you bring a charge against the book in which
I find what you acknowledge I ought to believe?

morals of the Catholic Church, where I have quoted the words, ‘For Thy
sake we are in suffering all day long, we are accounted as sheep for the
slaughter,’ the inaccuracy of my manuscript misled me; for my
recollection of the Scriptures was defective from my not being at that
time familiar with them.  For the reading of the other manuscripts has a
different meaning:  not, we suffer, but we suffer death, or, in one
word, we are killed.  That this is the true reading is shown by the
Greek text of the Septuagint, from which the Old Testament was
translated into Latin.  I have indeed made a good many remarks on the
words, ‘For thy sake we suffer,’ and the things said are not wrong in
themselves; but, as regards the harmony of the Old and New Testaments,
this case certainly does not prove it.  The error originated in the way
mentioned above, and this harmony is afterwards abundantly proved from
other passages."
