id="iv.viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Two Opposite Substances.  The
Kingdom of Light.  Manichæus Teaches Uncertainties Instead of
Certainties.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p2"></span>16.  "In the beginning, then," he says,
"these two substances were divided.  The empire of light was held by God
the Father, who is perpetual in holy origin, magnificent in virtue, true
in His very nature, ever rejoicing in His own eternity, possessing in
Himself wisdom and the vital senses, by which He also includes the
twelve members of His light, which are the plentiful resources of his
kingdom.  Also in each of His members are stored thousands of untold and
priceless treasures.  But the Father Himself, chief in praise,
incomprehensible in greatness, has united to Himself happy and glorious
worlds, incalculable in number and duration, along with which this holy
and illustrious Father and Progenitor resides, no poverty or infirmity
being admitted in His magnificent realms.  And these matchless realms
are so founded on the region of light and bliss, that no one can ever
move or disturb them." <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p4"></span>17.  Where is the proof of all this? 
And where did Manichæus learn it?  Do not frighten me with the name of
the Paraclete.  For, in the first place, I have come not to put faith in
unknown things, but to get the knowledge of undoubted truths, according
to the caution enjoined on me by yourselves.  For you know how bitterly
you taunt those who believe without consideration.  And what is more,
this writer, who here begins to tell of very doubtful things, himself
promised a little before to give complete and well-grounded knowledge.
