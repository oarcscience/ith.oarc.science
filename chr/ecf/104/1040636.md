<span id="v.v.v.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—</span>45.  But as for you,
when the case of the followers of Maximianus is brought up against you,
who, after being condemned by the sentence of a Council of 310
bishops; <span id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403) after being utterly
defeated in the same Council, quoted in the records of so many
proconsuls, in the chronicles of so many municipal towns; after being
driven forth from the basilicas of which they were in possession, by the
order of the judges, enforced by the troops of the several cities, were
yet again received with all honor by you, together with those whom they
had baptized outside the pale of your communion, without any question
respecting their baptism,—when confronted, I say, with their case, you
can find no reply to make.  Indeed, you are vanquished by an expressed
opinion, not indeed true, but proceeding from yourselves, by which you
maintain that men perish for the faults of others in the same communion
of the sacraments, and that each man’s character is determined by that
of the man by whom he is baptized,—that he is guilty if his baptizer is
guilty, innocent if he is innocent.  But if these views are true, there
can be no doubt that, to say nothing of innumerable others, you are
destroyed by the sins of the followers of Maximianus, whose guilt your
party, in so large a Council, has exaggerated even to the proportions of
the sin of those whom the earth swallowed up alive.  But if the faults
of the followers of Maximianus have not destroyed you, then are these
opinions false which you entertain; and much less have certain
indefinite unproved faults of the Africans been able to destroy the
entire world.  And accordingly, as the apostle says, "Every man shall
bear his own burden;" <span id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404) and the
baptism of Christ is no one’s except Christ’s; and it is to no purpose
that Petilianus promises that he will take as the subject of his second
book the charges which we bring concerning the followers of Maximianus,
entertaining too low an opinion of men’s intellects, as though they do
not perceive that he has nothing to say.
