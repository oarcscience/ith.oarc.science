<span id="v.v.v.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—</span>38.  See now how
Petilianus, to avoid answering this question, or to avoid being proved
to be incapable of answering it, wanders off vainly into irrelevant
matter in abuse of us, accusing us and proving nothing; and when he
chances to make an endeavor to resist, with something like a show of
fighting for his cause, he is everywhere overcome with the greatest
ease.  But yet he nowhere gives an answer of any kind to this one
question which we ask:  If the conscience of one that gives in holiness
is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, by what
means is he to be cleansed who received baptism while the conscience of
the giver was polluted, without the knowledge of him who was to receive
it? for in these words, which he quoted from my epistle, he set me forth
as asking a question, while he showed himself as giving no answer.  For
after saying what I have just now recited, and when, on being brought
into a great strait on every side, he had been compelled to say that the
baptizer ought to be examined by the candidate for baptism, and the
candidate in turn by the baptizer; and when he had tried to fortify this
statement by the example of John, in hopes that he might find auditors
either of the greatest negligence or of the greatest ignorance, he then
went on to advance other testimonies of Scripture wholly irrelevant to
the matter in hand, as the saying of the eunuch to Philip, "See, here is
water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?" <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) "inasmuch as he knew," says he,
"that those of abandoned character were prevented;" arguing that the
reason why Philip did not forbid him to be baptized was because he had
proved, in his reading of the Scriptures, how far he believed in
Christ,—as though he had prohibited Simon Magus.  And again, he urges
that the prophets were afraid of being deceived by false baptism, and
that therefore Isaiah said, "Lying water that has not faith," <span
id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) as though showing that water among
faithless men is lying; whereas it is not Isaiah but Jeremiah that says
this of lying men, calling the people in a figure water, as is most
clearly shown in the Apocalypse. <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md)   And again, he quotes as words of
David, "Let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head," when David has
been speaking of the flattery of the smooth speaker deceiving with false
praise, so as to lead the head of the man praised to wax great with
pride.  And this meaning is made manifest by the words immediately
preceding in the same psalm.  For he says, "Let the righteous smite me,
it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me:  but the oil of the
sinner shall not break my head." <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md)   What can be clearer than this
sentence? what more manifest?  For he declares that he had rather be
reproved in kindness with the sharp correction of the righteous, so that
he may be healed, than anointed with the soft speaking of the flatterer,
so as to be puffed up with pride.
