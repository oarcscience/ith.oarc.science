<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.iv-p2"></A>3.&#160; For my part, I,&#8212;who, after much and long-continued bewilderment, attained at last, to the discovery of the simple truth, which is learned without being recorded in any fanciful legend; who, unhappy that I was, barely succeeded, by God&#146;s help, in refuting the vain imaginations of my mind, gathered from theories and errors of various kinds; who so late sought the cure of my mental obscuration, in compliance with the call and the tender persuasion of the all-merciful Physician; who long wept that the immutable and inviolable Existence would vouchsafe to convince me inwardly of Himself, in harmony with the testimony of the sacred books; by whom, in fine, all those fictions which have such a firm hold on you, from your long familiarity with them, were diligently examined, and attentively heard, and too easily believed, and commended at every opportunity to the belief of others, and defended against opponents with determination and boldness,&#8212;I can on no account rage against you; for I must bear with you now as formerly I had to bear with myself, and I must be as patient towards you as my associates were with me, when I went madly and blindly astray in your beliefs.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.iv-p3"></A>4.&#160; On the other hand, all must allow that you owe it to me, in return, to lay aside all arrogance on your part too, that so you may be the more disposed to gentleness, and may not oppose me in a hostile spirit, to your own hurt.&#160; Let neither of us assert that he has found truth; let us seek it as if it were unknown to us both.&#160; For truth can be sought with zeal and unanimity if by no rash presumption it is believed to have been already found and ascertained.&#160; But if I cannot induce you to grant me this, at least allow me to suppose myself a stranger now for the first time hearing you, for the first time examining your doctrines.&#160; I think my demand a just one.&#160; And it must be laid down as an understood thing that I am not to join you in your prayers, or in holding conventicles, or in taking the name of Manich&aelig;us, unless you give me a clear explanation, without any obscurity, of all matters touching the salvation of the soul.</p>
