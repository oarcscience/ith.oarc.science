<span id="iv.ix.xxxii"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="iv.ix.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Book XXX.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-p2"></span>Faustus repels the insinuation that the
prophecy of Paul with reference to those that should forbid to marry,
abstain from meats, etc., applies to the Manichæans more than to the
Catholic ascetics, who are held in the highest esteem in the Church. 
Augustin justifies this application of the prophecy, and shows the
difference between Manichæan and Christian asceticism.

<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xxxii-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  You apply to us the
words of Paul:  "Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to lying
spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having
their consciences seared as with a hot iron; forbidding to marry,
abstaining from meats, which God has created to be received with
thanksgiving by believers." <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md)  
I refuse to admit that the apostle said this, unless you first
acknowledge that Moses and the prophets taught doctrines of devils, and
were the interpreters of a lying and malignant spirit; since they enjoin
with great emphasis abstinence from swine’s flesh and other meats, which
they call unclean.  This case must first be settled; and you must
consider long and carefully how their teaching is to be viewed:  whether
they said these things from God, or from the devil.  As regards these
matters, either Moses and the prophets must be condemned along with us;
or we must be acquitted along with them.  You are unjust in condemning
us, as you do now, as followers of the doctrine of devils, because we
require the priestly class to abstain from animal food; for we limit the
prohibition to the priesthood, while you hold that your prophets, and
Moses himself, who forbade all classes of men to eat the flesh of swine,
and hares, and conies, besides all varieties of cuttle-fish, and all
fish wanting scales, said this not in a lying spirit, nor in the
doctrine of devils, but from God, and in the Holy Spirit.  Even
supposing, then, that Paul said these words, you can convince me only by
condemning Moses and the prophets; and so, though you will not do it for
reason or truth, you will contradict Moses for the sake of your belly.

<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-p5"></span>2.  Besides, you have in your Book of
Daniel the account of the three youths, which you will find it difficult
to reconcile with the opinion that to abstain from meats is the doctrine
of devils.  For we are told that they abstained not only from what the
law forbade, but even from what it allowed; <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md) and you are wont to praise them,
and count them as martyrs; though they too followed the doctrine of
devils, if this is to be taken as the apostle’s opinion.  And Daniel
himself declares that he fasted for three weeks, not eating flesh or
drinking wine, while he prayed for his people. <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md)   How is it that he boasts of this
doctrine of devils, and glories in the falsehood of a lying spirit?

<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-p8"></span>3.  Again, what are we to think of you,
or of the better class of Christians among you, some of whom abstain
from swine’s flesh, some from the flesh of quadrupeds, and some from all
animal food, while all the Church admires them for it, and regards them
with profound veneration, as only not gods?  You obstinately refuse to
consider that if the words quoted from the apostle are true and genuine,
these people too are misled by doctrines of devils.  And there is
another observance which no one will venture to explain away or to deny,
for it is known to all, and is practised yearly with particular
attention in the congregation of Catholics all over the world—I mean the
fast of forty days, in the due observance of which a man must abstain
from all the things which, according to this verse, were created by God
that we might receive them, while at the same time he calls this
abstinence a doctrine of devils.  So, my dear friends, shall we say that
you too, during this fast, while celebrating the mysteries of Christ’s
passion, live after the manner of <span id="page_329">p. 329</span>
<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-Page_329"></span>devils, and are deluded by a
seducing spirit, and speak lies in hypocrisy, and have your conscience
seared with a hot iron?  If this does not apply to you, neither does it
apply to us.  What is to be thought of this verse, or its author; or to
whom does it apply, since it agrees neither with the traditions of the
Old Testament, nor with the institutions of the New?  As regards the New
Testament, the proof is from your own practice; and though the Old
requires abstinence only from certain things, still it requires
abstinence.  On the other hand, this opinion of yours makes all
abstinence from animal food a doctrine of devils.  If this is your
belief, once more I say it, you must condemn Moses, and reject the
prophets, and pass the same sentence on yourselves; for, as they always
abstained from certain kinds of food, so you sometimes abstain from all
food.

<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-p9"></span>4.  But if you think that in making a
distinction in food, Moses and the prophets established a divine
ordinance, and not a doctrine of devils; if Daniel in the Holy Spirit
observed a fast of three weeks; if the youths Ananias, Azarias, and
Mishael, under divine guidance, chose to live on cabbage or pulse; if,
again, those among you who abstain, do it not at the instigation of
devils; if your abstinence from wine and flesh for forty days is not
superstitious, but by divine command,—consider, I beseech you, if it is
not perfect madness to suppose these words to be Paul’s that abstinence
from food and forbidding to marry are doctrines of devils.  Paul cannot
have said that to dedicate virgins to Christ is a doctrine of devils. 
But you read the words, and inconsiderately, as usual, apply them to us,
without seeing that this stamps your virgins too as led away by the
doctrine of devils, and that you are the functionaries of the devils in
your constant endeavors to induce virgins to make this profession, so
that in all your churches the virgins nearly outnumber the married
women.  Why do you still adhere to such practises?  Why do you ensnare
wretched young women, if it is the will of devils, and not of Christ,
that they fulfill?  But, first of all, I wish to know if making virgins
is, in all cases, the doctrine of devils, or only the prohibition of
marriage.  If it is the prohibition, it does not apply to us, for we too
hold it equally foolish to prevent one who wishes, as it is criminal and
impious to force one who has some reluctance.  But if you say that to
encourage the proposal, and not to resist such a desire, is all the
doctrine of devils, to say nothing of the consequence as regards you,
the apostle himself will be thus brought into danger, if he must be
considered as having introduced the doctrines of devils into Iconium,
when Thecla, after having been betrothed, was by his discourse inflamed
with the desire of perpetual virginity. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md)   And what shall we say of Jesus,
the Master Himself, and the source of all sanctity, who is the unwedded
spouse of the virgins who make this profession, and who, when specifying
in the Gospel three kinds of eunuchs, natural, artificial, and
voluntary, gives the palm to those who have "made themselves eunuchs for
the kingdom of heaven," <span id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md)
meaning the youths of both sexes who have extirpated from their hearts
the desire of marriage, and who in the Church act as eunuchs of the
King’s palace?  Is this also the doctrine of devils?  Are those words,
too, spoken in a seducing spirit?  And if Paul and Christ are proved to
be priests of devils, is not their spirit the same that speaks in God? 
I do not mention the other apostles of our Lord, Peter, Andrew, Thomas,
and the example of celibacy, the blessed John, who in various ways
commended to young men and maidens the excellence of this profession,
leaving to us, and to you too, the form for making virgins.  I do not
mention them, because you do not admit them into the canon, and so you
will not scruple impiously to impute to them doctrines of devils.  But
will you say the same of Christ, or of the Apostle Paul, who, we know,
everywhere expressed the same preference for unmarried women to the
married, and gave an example of it in the case of the saintly Thecla? 
But if the doctrine preached by Paul to Thecla, and which the other
apostles also preached, was not the doctrine of devils, how can we
believe that Paul left on record his opinion, that the very exhortation
to sanctity is the injunction and the doctrine of devils?  To make
virgins simply by exhortation, without forbidding to marry, is not
peculiar to you.  That is our principle too; and he must be not only a
fool, but a madman, who thinks that a private law can forbid what the
public law allows.  As regards marriage, therefore, we too encourage
virgins to remain as they are when they are willing to do so; we do not
make them virgins against their will.  For we know the force of will and
of natural appetite when opposed by public law; much more when the law
is only private, and every one is at liberty to disobey it.  If, then,
it is no crime to make virgins in this manner, we are guiltless as well
as you.  If it is wrong to make virgins in any way, you are guilty as
well as we.  So that what you mean, or intend, by quoting this verse
against us, it is impossible to say.

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxxii-Page_330"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-p12"></span>5.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xxxii-p12.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  Listen, and you
shall hear what we mean and intend by quoting this verse against you,
since you say that you do not know.  It is not that you abstain from
animal food; for, as you observe, our ancient fathers abstained from
some kinds of food, not, however, as condemning them, but with a typical
meaning, which you do not understand, and of which I have said already
in this work all that appeared necessary.  Besides, Christians, not
heretics, but Catholics, in order to subdue the body, that the soul may
be more humbled in prayer, abstain not only from animal food, but also
from some vegetable productions, without, however, believing them to be
unclean.  A few do this always; and at certain seasons or days, as in
Lent, almost all, more or less, according to the choice or ability of
individuals.  You, on the other hand, deny that the creature is good,
and call it unclean, saying that animals are made by the devil of the
worst impurities in the substance of evil and so you reject them with
horror, as being the most cruel and loathsome places of confinement of
your god.  You, as a concession, allow your followers, as distinct from
the priests, to eat animal food; as the apostle allows, in certain
cases, not marriage in the general sense, but the indulgence of passion
in marriage. <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md)   It is only sin
which is thus made allowance for.  This is the feeling you have toward
all animal food; you have learned it from your heresy, and you teach it
to your followers.  You make allowance for your followers, because, as I
said before, they supply you with necessaries; but you grant them
indulgence without saying that it is not sinful.  For yourselves, you
shun contact with this evil and impurity; and hence our reason for
quoting this verse against you is found in the words of the apostle
which follow those with which you end the quotation.  Perhaps it was for
this reason that you left out the words, and then say that you do not
know what we mean or intend by the quotation; for it suited you better
to omit the account of our intention than to express it.  For, after
speaking of abstaining from meats, which God has created to be received
with thanksgiving by believers, the apostle goes on, "And by them who
know the truth; for every creature of God is good, and nothing to be
refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:  for it is sanctified by
the word of God and prayer." <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md)
  This you deny; for your idea, and motive, and belief in abstaining
from such food is, that they are not typically, but naturally, evil and
impure.  In this assuredly you blaspheme the Creator; and in this is the
doctrine of devils.  You need not be surprised that, so long before the
event, this prediction regarding you was made by the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ix.xxxii-p15"></span>6.  So, again, if your exhortations to
virginity resembled the teaching of the apostle, "He who giveth in
marriage doeth well, and he who giveth not in marriage doeth
better;" <span id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) if you taught that
marriage is good, and virginity better, as the Church teaches which is
truly Christ’s Church, you would not have been described in the Spirit’s
prediction as forbidding to marry.  What a man forbids he makes evil;
but a good thing may be placed second to a better thing without being
forbidden.  Moreover, the only honorable kind of marriage, or marriage
entered into for its proper and legitimate purpose, is precisely that
you hate most.  So, though you may not forbid sexual intercourse, you
forbid marriage; for the peculiarity of marriage is, that it is not
merely for the gratification of passion, but, as is written in the
contract, for the procreation of children.  And, though you allow many
of your followers to retain their connection with you in spite of their
refusal, or their inability, to obey you, you cannot deny that you make
the prohibition.  The prohibition is part of your false doctrine, while
the toleration is only for the interests of the society.  And here we
see the reason, which I have delayed till now to mention, for your
making not the birth but only the death of Christ feigned and illusory. 
Death being the separation of the soul, that is, of the nature of your
god, from the body which belongs to his enemies, for it is the work of
the devil, you uphold and approve of it; and thus, according to your
creed, it was meet that Christ, though He did not die, should commend
death by appearing to die.  In birth, again, you believe your god to be
bound instead of released; and so you will not allow that Christ was
born even in this illusory fashion.  You would have thought better of
Mary had she ceased to be a virgin without being a mother, than as being
a mother without ceasing to be a virgin.  You see, then, that there is a
great difference between exhorting to virginity as the better of two
good things, and forbidding to marry by denouncing the true purpose of
marriage; between abstaining from food as a symbolic observance, or for
the mortification of the body, and abstaining from food which God has
created for the reason that God did not create it.  In one case, we have
the doctrine of the prophets and apostles; in the other, the doctrine of
lying devils.
