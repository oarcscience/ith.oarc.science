<span id="v.iv.viii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—</span>9.  First, then, let us
record for further consideration the case proposed for decision by
Cyprian himself, with which he initiates the proceedings of the Council,
and by which he shows a peaceful spirit, abounding in the fruitfulness
of Christian charity.  "Ye have read," he says, "most beloved
colleagues, what Jubaianus, our fellow-bishop, has written to me,
consulting my <span id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.vi-Page_482"></span>poor ability about the unlawful and
profane baptism of heretics, and what I have written back to him,
expressing to him the same opinion that I have expressed once and again
and often, that heretics coming to the Church ought to be baptized, and
sanctified with the baptism of the Church.  Another letter also of
Jubaianus has been read to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere and
religious devotion, in answer to our epistle, he not only expressed his
assent to it, but also gratefully acknowledged that he had received
instruction.  It remains that we should individually express our
opinions on this same subject, judging no one, and removing no one from
the right of communion if he should entertain a different opinion.  For
neither does any one of us set himself up as a bishop of bishops, or by
tyrannical terror force his colleagues to the necessity of obeying,
since every bishop, in the free use of his liberty and power, has the
right of free judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he can
himself judge another.  But we are all awaiting the judgment of our Lord
Jesus Christ who alone has the power both of preferring us in the
government of His Church, and of judging of our actions." <span
