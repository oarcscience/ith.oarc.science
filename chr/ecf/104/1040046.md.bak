<span id="iv.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Four Moral Duties Regarding the
Love of God, of Which Love the Reward is Eternal Life and the Knowledge
of the Truth.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxvii-p2"></span>46.  I need say no more about right
conduct.  For if God is man’s chief good, which you cannot deny, it
clearly follows, since to seek the chief good is to live well, that to
live well is nothing else but to love God with all the heart, with all
the soul, with all the mind; and, as arising from this, that this love
must be preserved entire and incorrupt, which is the part of temperance;
that it give way before no troubles, which is the part of fortitude;
that it serve no other, which is the part of justice; that it be
watchful in its inspection of things lest craft or fraud steal in, which
is the part of prudence.  This is the one perfection of man, by which
alone he can succeed in attaining to the purity of truth.  This both
Testaments enjoin in concert; this is commended on both sides alike. 
Why do you continue to cast reproaches on Scriptures of which you are
ignorant?  Do you not see the folly of your attack upon books which only
those who do not understand them find fault with, and which only those
who find fault fail in understanding?  For neither can an enemy know
them, nor can one who knows them be other than a friend to them.

<span id="iv.iv.xxvii-p3"></span>47.  Let us then, as many as have in
view to reach eternal life, love God with all the heart, with all the
soul, with all the mind.  For eternal life contains the whole reward in
the promise of which we rejoice; nor can the reward precede desert, nor
be given to a man before he is worthy of it.  What can be more unjust
than this, and what is more just than God?  We should not then demand
the reward before we deserve to get it.  Here, perhaps, it is not out of
place to ask what is eternal life; or rather let us hear the Bestower of
it:  "This," He says, "is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the
true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent." <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)   So eternal life is the knowledge of
the truth.  See, then, how perverse and preposterous is the character of
those who think that their teaching of the knowledge of God will make us
perfect, when this is the reward of those already perfect!  What else,
then, have we to do but first to love with full affection Him whom we
desire to know? <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md)   Hence arises
that principle on which we have all <span id="page_55">p. 55</span>
<span id="iv.iv.xxvii-Page_55"></span>along insisted, that there is
nothing more wholesome in the Catholic Church than using authority <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) before argument.

said *sincere* affection rather than full; or it might be thought that
the love of God will be no greater when we shall see Him face to face. 
Full, then, must be here understood as meaning that it cannot be greater
while we walk by faith.  There will be greater, yea, perfect fullness,
but only by sight."
