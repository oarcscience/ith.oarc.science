<span id="iv.ix.ix-p2"></span>The genealogical question is again taken
up and argued on both sides.

<span id="iv.ix.ix-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.ix-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  You ask why I do not
believe in the genealogy of Jesus.  There are many reasons; but the
principal is, that He never declares with His own lips that He had an
earthly father or descent, but on the contrary, that he is not of this
world, that He came forth from God the Father, that He descended from
heaven, that He has no mother or brethren except those who do the will
of His Father in heaven.  Besides, the framers of these genealogies do
not seem to have known Jesus before His birth or soon after it, so as to
have the credibility of eye-witnesses of what they narrate.  They became
acquainted with Jesus as a young man of about thirty years of age, if it
is not blasphemy to speak of the age of a divine being.  Now the
question regarding a witness is always whether he has seen or heard what
he testifies to.  But the writers of these genealogies never assert that
they heard the account from Jesus Himself, nor even the fact of His
birth; nor did they see Him till they came to know Him after his
baptism, many years after the time of His birth.  To me, therefore, and
to every sensible man, it appears as foolish to believe this account, as
it would be to call into court a blind and deaf witness.

<span id="iv.ix.ix-p4"></span>2.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.ix-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  As regards what
Faustus calls his principal reason for not receiving the genealogy of
Jesus Christ, a complete refutation is found in the passages formerly
quoted, where Christ declares Himself to be the Son of man, and in what
we have said of the identity of the Son of man with the Son of God: 
that in His Godhead He has no earthly descent, while after the flesh He
is of the seed of David, as the apostle teaches.  We are to believe,
therefore, that He came forth from the Father, that He descended from
heaven, and also that the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst men.  If
the words, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) are quoted to show that Christ had no
earthly mother or descent, it follows that we must believe that His
disciples, whom He here teaches by His own example to set no value on
earthly relationship, as compared with the kingdom of heaven, had no
fathers, because Christ says to them, "Call no man father upon earth;
for one is your Father, even God." <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md)   What He taught them to do with
reference to their fathers, He Himself first did in reference to His own
mother and brethren; as in many other things He condescended to set us
an example, and to go before that we might follow in His footsteps. 
Faustus’ principal objection to the genealogy fails completely; and
after the defeat of this invincible force, the rest is easily routed. 
He says that the apostles who declared Christ to be the Son of man as
well as the Son of God are not to be believed, because they were not
present at the birth of Christ, whom they joined when He had reached
manhood, nor heard of it from Christ Himself.  Why then do they believe
John when he says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God.  The same was in the beginning with God.  All
things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made," <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) and such passages, which they agree
to, without understanding them?  Where did John see this, or did he ever
hear it from the Lord Himself?  In whatever way John learned this, those
who narrate the nativity may have learned also.  Again, how do they know
that the Lord said, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?"  If on
the authority of the evangelist, why do they not also believe that the
mother and the brethren of Christ were seeking for Him?  They believe
that Christ said these words, which they misunderstand, while they deny
a fact resting on the same authority.  Once more, if Matthew could not
know that Christ was born, because he knew Him only in His manhood, how
could Manichæus, who lived so long after, know that He was not born? 
They will say that Manichæus knew this from the Holy Spirit which was in
him.  Certainly the Holy Spirit would make him speak the truth.  But why
not rather believe what Christ’s own disciples tell us, who were
personally acquainted with Him, and who not only had the gift of
inspiration to supply defects in their knowledge, but in a purely
natural way obtained information of the birth of Christ, and of His
descent, when the event was fresh in memory?  And yet he dares to call
the apostles deaf and blind.  Why were you not deaf and blind, to
prevent you from learning such profane nonsense, and dumb too, to
prevent you from uttering it?
