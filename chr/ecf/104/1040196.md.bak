id="iv.x.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—All Good Things are from God
Alone.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xiv-p2"></span>All these things are so perspicuous, so
assured, that if they who introduce another nature which God did not
make, were willing to give attention, they would not be filled with so
great blasphemies, as that they should place so great good things in
supreme evil, and so great evil things in God.  For what the truth
compels them to acknowledge, namely, that all good things are from God
alone, suffices for their correction, if they were willing to give heed,
as I said above.  Not, therefore, are great good things from one, and
small good things from another; but good things great and small are from
the supremely good alone, which is God.
