<span id="v.iv.ix.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—</span>86.  Secundianus of
Thambei <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) said:  "We ought not
to deceive heretics by our too great forwardness, that not having been
baptized in the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ, and having therefore
not received remission of their sins, they may not impute to us, when
the day of judgment comes, that we have been the cause of their not
being baptized, and not having obtained the indulgence of the grace of
God.  On which account, since there is one Church and one baptism, when
they are converted to us, let them receive together with the Church the
baptism also of the Church." <span id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xliv-p4"></span>87.  Nay, when they are transferred to
the rock, and joined to the society of the Dove, let them receive the
remission of their sins, which they could not have outside the rock and
outside the Dove, whether they were openly without, like the heretics,
or apparently within, like the abandoned Catholics; of whom, however, it
is clear that they both have and confer baptism without remission of
sins, when even from themselves it is received by men, who, being not
changed for the better, honor God with their lips, while their heart is
far from Him. <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md)   Yet it is
true that there is one baptism, just as there is one Dove, though those
who are not in the one communion of the Dove may yet have baptism in
common.
