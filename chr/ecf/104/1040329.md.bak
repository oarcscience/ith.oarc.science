<span id="v.iv.vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—</span>4.  But since now, as I
said before, we have begun a disputation with the epistles of Cyprian, I
think that I should not seem even to him, if he were present, "to be
contending obstinately and persistently in defense of heretics against
my brethren and my fellow-priests," when he learned the powerful reasons
which move us to believe that even among heretics, who are perversely
obstinate in their malignant error, the baptism of Christ is yet in
itself most holy, and most highly to be reverenced.  And seeing that he
himself, whose testimony has such weight with us, bears witness that
they were wont in past times to be admitted without a second baptism, I
would have any one, who is induced by Cyprian’s arguments to hold it as
certain that heretics ought to be baptized afresh, yet consider that
those who, on account of weight of the arguments on the other side, are
not as yet persuaded that this should be so, hold the same place as
those in past time, who in all honesty admitted men who were baptized in
heresy on the simple correction of their individual error, and who were
capable of salvation with them in virtue of the bond of unity.  And let
any one, who is led by the past custom of the Church, and by the
subsequent authority of a plenary Council, and by so many powerful
proofs from holy Scripture, and by much evidence from Cyprian himself,
and by the clear reasoning of truth, to understand that the baptism of
Christ, consecrated in the words of the gospel, cannot be perverted by
the error of any man on earth,—let such an one understand, that they who
then thought otherwise, but yet preserved their charity, can be saved by
the same bond of unity.  And herein he should also understand of those
who, in the society of the Church dispersed throughout the world, could
not have been defiled by any tares, by any chaff, so long as they
themselves desired to be fruitful corn, and who therefore severed
themselves from the same bond of unity without any cause for the
divorce, that at any rate, whichever of the two opinions be true,—that
which Cyprian then held, or that which was maintained by the universal
voice of the Catholic Church, which Cyprian did not abandon,—in either
case they, having most openly placed themselves outside in the plain
sacrilege of schism, cannot possibly be saved, and all that they possess
of the holy sacraments, and of the free gifts of the one legitimate
Bridegroom, is of avail, while they continue what they are, for their
confusion rather than the salvation of their souls.
