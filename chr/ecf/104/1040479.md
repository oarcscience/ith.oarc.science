<span id="v.v.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—</span>24.  What if the holy
and true Church of Christ were to convince and overcome you, even if we
held no documents in support of our cause, or only such as were false,
while you had possession of some genuine proofs of delivery of the
sacred books? what would then remain for you, except that, if you would,
you should show your love of peace, or otherwise should hold your
tongues? <span id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957.md)   For whatever, in
that case, you might bring forward in evidence, I should be able to say
with the greatest ease and the most perfect truth, that then you are
bound to prove as much to the full and catholic unity of the Church
already spread abroad and established throughout so many nations, to the
end that you should remain within, and that those whom you convict
should be expelled.  And if you have endeavored to do this, certainly
you have not been able to make good your proof; and being vanquished or
enraged, you have separated yourselves, with all the heinous guilt of
sacrilege, from the guiltless men who could not condemn on insufficient
proof.  But if you have not even endeavored to do this, then with most
accursed and unnatural blindness you have cut yourselves off from the
wheat of Christ, which grows throughout His whole fields, that is,
throughout the whole world, until the end, because you have taken
offense at a few tares in Africa.

conjecture of Migne or "obtumescatis," which could only mean, "you
should swell with confusion."
