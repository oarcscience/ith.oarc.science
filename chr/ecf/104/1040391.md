<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—</span>71. Libosus of
Vaga <span id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727) said:  "The Lord says in
the gospel, ‘I am the truth;’ <span id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728)
He did not say, I am custom.  Therefore, when the truth is made
manifest, let custom yield to truth; so that, if even in time <span
id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxvii-Page_496"></span>past any one did not baptize
heretics in the Church, he may now begin to baptize them." <span
id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxvii-p5"></span>72.  Here he has in no way tried
to show how that is the truth to which he says that custom ought to
yield.  But it is of more importance that he helps us against those who
have separated themselves from unity, by confessing that the custom
existed, than that he thinks it ought to yield to a truth which he does
not show.  For the custom is of such a nature, that if it admitted
sacrilegious men to the altar of Christ without the cleansing of
baptism, and polluted none of the good men who remained in unity, then
all who have cut themselves off from the same unity, in which they could
not be polluted by the contagion of any evil persons whatsoever, have
separated themselves without reason, and have committed the manifest
sacrilege of schism.  But if all perished in pollution through that
custom, from what cavern do they issue without the original truth, and
with all the cunning of calumny?  If, however, the custom was a right
one by which heretics were thus received, let them abandon their
madness, let them confess their error; let them come to the Catholic
Church, not that they may be bathed again with the sacrament of baptism,
but that they may be cured from the wound of severance.
