<p class="c41"><a name="v.iv.vii.xiii-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.iv.vii.xiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 13.&#8212;</span>15.&#160; For the Lord Jesus might, if He had so thought fit, have given the power of His baptism to some one or more of His chief servants, whom He had already made His friends, such as those to whom He says, "Henceforth I call you not servants, but friends;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1496"></A><A HREF="#fn_1496"><FONT SIZE="1">1497</FONT></A>
 that, as Aaron was shown to be the priest by the rod that budded,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1497"></A><A HREF="#fn_1497"><FONT SIZE="1">1498</FONT></A>
 so in His Church, when more and greater miracles are performed, the ministers of more excellent holiness, and the dispensers of His mysteries, might be made manifest by some sign, as those who alone ought to baptize.&#160; But if this had been done, then though the power of baptizing were given them by the Lord, yet it would necessarily be called their own baptism, as in the case of the baptism of John.&#160; And so Paul gives thanks to God that he baptized none of those men who, as   though forgetting in whose name they had been baptized, were for dividing themselves into factions under the names of different individuals.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1498"></A><A HREF="#fn_1498"><FONT SIZE="1">1499</FONT></A>
&#160; For when baptism is as valid at the hands of a contemptible man as it was when given by an apostle, it is recognized as the baptism neither of this man nor of that, but of Christ; as John bears witness that he learned, in the case of the Lord Himself, through the appearance of the dove.&#160; For in what other respect he said, "And I knew Him not," I cannot clearly see.&#160; For if he had not known Him in any sense, he could not have said to Him when He came to his baptism, "I   have need to be baptized of Thee."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1499"></A><A HREF="#fn_1499"><FONT SIZE="1">1500</FONT></A>
&#160; What is it, therefore, that he says, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him.&#160; And I knew Him not:&#160; but He that sent me to baptizewith water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1500"></A><A HREF="#fn_1500"><FONT SIZE="1">1501</FONT></A>
&#160; The dove clearly descended on Him after He was baptized.&#160; But while He was yet coming to be baptized, John had said, "I have need to be baptized of Thee."&#160; He therefore already knew Him.&#160; What does he therefore mean by the words, "I knew Him not:&#160; but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost," since this took place after He was   baptized, unless it were that he knew Him in respect of certain attributes, and in respect of others knew Him not?&#160; He knew Him, indeed, as the Son of God, the Bridegroom, of whose fullness all should receive; but whereas of His fullness he himself had so received the power of baptizing that it should be called the baptism of John, he did not know whether He would so give it to others also, or whether He would have His own baptism in such wise, that at whosesoever hands it was given, whether by   a man that brought forth fruit a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold, whether by the wheat or by the chaff, it should be known to be of Him alone; and this he learned through the Spirit descending like a dove, and abiding on Him.</p>
