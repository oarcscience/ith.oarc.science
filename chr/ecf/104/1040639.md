<span id="v.v.v.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—</span>51.  For what I just now
said is put with the greatest clearness in that very epistle of mine, in
answering which he has said nothing; and I would beg of you to listen
for a few moments to what he there has done.  And although you are
partisans of his, and hate us, yet, if you can, bear it with
equanimity.  For in his former epistle, to the first portion of
which—the only portion which had then come into our hands—I had in the
first instance made my reply, he had so rested the hope that is found in
baptism in the baptizer, as to say, "For everything consists of an
origin and root; and if anything has not a head, it is nothing."  Since
then Petilianus had said this, not wishing anything to be understood by
the origin and root and head of baptizing a man, except the man by whom
he might be baptized, I made a comment, and said "We ask, therefore, in
a case where the faithlessness of the baptizer is undetected, if then
the man whom he baptizes receives faith and not guilt? if then the
baptizer is not his origin and root and head, who is it from whom he
receives faith? where is the origin from which he springs? where is the
root of which he is a shoot? where the head which is his
starting-point?  Can it be that, when he who is baptized is unaware of
the faithlessness of his baptizer, it is then Christ who is the origin
and root and head?"  This therefore I say and exclaim now also, as I did
there as well:  "Alas for human rashness and conceit!  Why do you not
allow that it is always Christ who gives faith, for the purpose of
making a man a Christian by giving it?  Why do you not allow that Christ
is always the origin of the Christian, that the Christian always plants
his root in Christ, that Christ is the Head of the Christian?  Will it
then be urged that, even where spiritual grace is dispensed to those
that believe by the hands of a holy and faithful minister, it is still
not the minister himself who justifies, but that One of whom it is said,
‘He justifieth the ungodly’? <span id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407)
  But unless we admit this, either the Apostle Paul was the head and
origin of those whom he had planted, or Apollos the root of those whom
he had watered, rather than He who had given them faith in briefing;
whereas the same Paul says, ‘I have planted, Apollos watered; but God
gave the increase.  So that neither is he that planteth anything,
neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.’ <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408)   Nor was the apostle himself their
root, but rather He who says, ‘I am the vine, ye are the
branches.’ <span id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409)   How, too, could
he be their head, when he says that ‘we, being many, are one body in
Christ,’ <span id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410) and expressly
declares in many passages that Christ Himself is the Head of the whole
body?  Wherefore, whether a man receives the sacrament of baptism from a
faithful or a faithless minister his whole hope is in Christ, that he
fall not under the condemnation, that ‘Cursed is he that placeth his
hope in man!’" <span id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411)
