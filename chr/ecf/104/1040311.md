<span id="v.iv.vi.xiii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> 13.—20.  There is therefore
"no fellowship between righteousness and unrighteousness," <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) not only without, but also within
the Church; for "the Lord knoweth them that are His," and "Let every one
that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."  There is also "no
communion between light and darkness," <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) not only without, but also within
the Church; for "he that hateth his brother is still in darkness." <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414.md)   And they at any rate hated Paul,
who, preaching Christ of envy and malicious strife, supposed that they
added affliction to his bonds; <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) and yet the same Cyprian
understands these still to have been within the Church.  Since,
therefore, "neither darkness can enlighten, nor <span id="page_456">p.
456</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.xiii-Page_456"></span>unrighteousness
justify," <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416.md) as Cyprian again
says, I ask, how could those men baptize within the very Church
herself?  I ask, how could those vessels which the large house contains
not to honor, but to dishonor, administer what is holy for the
sanctifying of men within the great house itself, unless because that
holiness of the sacrament cannot be polluted even by the unclean, either
when it is given at their hands, or when it is received by those who in
heart and life are not changed for the better? of whom, as situated
within the Church, Cyprian himself says, "Renouncing the world in word
only, and not in deed." <span id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417.md)

<span id="v.iv.vi.xiii-p8"></span>21.  There are therefore also within
the Church "enemies of God, whose hearts the spirit of Antichrist has
possessed;" and yet they, "deal with spiritual and divine things," <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418.md) which cannot profit for their
salvation so long as they remain such as they are; and yet neither can
they pollute them by their own uncleanness.  With regard to what he
says, therefore, "that they have no part given them in the saving grace
of the Church, who, scattering and fighting against the Church of
Christ, are called adversaries by Christ Himself, and antichrists by His
apostles, <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md) this must be
received under the consideration that there are men of this kind both
within and without.  But the separation of those that are within from
the perfection and unity of the dove is not only known in the case of
some men to God, but even in the case of some to their fellow-men; for,
by regarding their openly abandoned life and confirmed wickedness, and
comparing it with the rules of God’s commandments, they understand to
what a multitude of tares and chaff, situated now some within and some
without, but destined to be most manifestly separated at the last day,
the Lord will then say, "Depart from me, ye that work iniquity," <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) and "Depart into everlasting fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels." <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md)
