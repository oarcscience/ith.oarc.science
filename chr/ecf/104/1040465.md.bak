<span id="v.v.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—</span>9.  When he hears,
"Every good tree bringeth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth
evil fruit:  do men gather grapes of thorns?" <span
id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md) and, "A good man out of the good
treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and an evil man out of
the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things;" <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md) he will answer, This therefore is
good fruit, that I should be a good tree, that is, a good man, that I
should show forth good fruit, that is, good works.  But this will be
given to me, not by him that planteth, nor by him that watereth, but by
God that giveth the increase.  For if the good tree be the good
baptizer, so that his good fruit should be the man whom he baptizes,
then any one who has been baptized by a bad man, even if his wickedness
be not manifest, will have no power to be good, for he is sprung from an
evil tree.  For a good tree is one thing; a tree whose quality is
concealed, but yet bad, is another.  Or if, when the tree is bad, but
hides its badness, then whosoever is baptized by it is born not of it,
but of Christ; then they are justified with more perfect holiness who
are baptized by the bad who hide their evil nature, than they who are
baptized by the manifestly good. <span
