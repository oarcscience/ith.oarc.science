<span id="v.v.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—</span>5.  Nor would I therefore be
understood to urge that ecclesiastical discipline should be set at
naught, and that every one should be allowed to do exactly as he
pleased, without any check, without a kind of healing chastisement, a
lenity which should inspire fear, the severity of love.  For then what
will become of the precept of the apostle, "Warn them that are unruly,
comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men;
see that none render evil for evil unto any man?" <span
id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337)   At any rate, when he added these
last words, "See that none render evil for evil unto any man," he showed
with sufficient clearness that there is no rendering of evil for evil
when one chastises <span id="page_599">p. 599</span> <span
id="v.v.v.iv-Page_599"></span>those that are unruly, even though for the
fault of unruliness be administered the punishment of chastising.  The
punishment of chastising therefore is not an evil, though the fault be
an evil.  For indeed it is the steel, not of an enemy inflicting a
wound, but of a surgeon performing an operation.  Things like this are
done within the Church, and that spirit of gentleness within its pale
burns with zeal towards God, lest the chaste virgin which is espoused to
one husband, even Christ, should in any of her members be corrupted from
the simplicity which is in Christ, as Eve was beguiled by the subtilty
of the serpent. <span id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338)  
Notwithstanding, far be it from the servants of the father of the family
that they should be unmindful of the precept of their Lord, and be so
inflamed with the fire of holy indignation against the multitude of the
tares, that while they seek to gather them in bundles before the time,
the wheat should be rooted up together with them.  And of this sin these
men would be held to be guilty, even though they showed that those were
true charges which they brought against the *traditors* whom they
accused; because they separated themselves in a spirit of impious
presumption, not only from the wicked, whose society they professed to
be avoiding, but also from the good and faithful in all nations of the
world, to whom they could not prove the truth of what they said they
knew; and with themselves they drew away into the same destruction many
others over whom they had some slight authority, and who were not wise
enough to understand that the unity of the Church dispersed throughout
the world was on no account to be forsaken for other men’s sins.  So
that, even though they themselves knew that they were pressing true
charges against certain of their neighbors, yet in this way a weak
brother, for whom Christ died, was perishing through their
knowledge; <span id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339) whilst, being
offended at other men’s sins, he was destroying in himself the blessing
of peace which he had with the good brethren, who partly had never heard
such charges, partly had shrunk from giving hasty credence to what was
neither discussed nor proved, partly, in the peaceful spirit of
humility, had left these charges, whatsoever they might be, to the
cognizance of the judges of the Church, to whom the whole matter had
been referred, across the sea.
