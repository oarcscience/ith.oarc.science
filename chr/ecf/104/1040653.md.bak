<span id="v.v.v.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56.—</span>68.  And if this is
rightly said of the gospel, with how much greater certainty should it be
said of baptism, which belongs to the gospel in such wise, that without
it no one can reach the kingdom of heaven, and with it only if to the
sacrament be added righteousness?  For He who said, "Except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God," <span id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md) said Himself also,
"Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes
and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
heaven." <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md)   The form of the
sacrament is given through baptism, the form of righteousness through
the gospel.  Neither one without the other leads to the kingdom of
heaven.  Yet even men of inferior learning can baptize perfectly, but to
preach the gospel perfectly is a task of much greater difficulty and
rarity.  Therefore the teacher of the Gentiles, that was superior in
excellence to the majority, was sent to preach the gospel, not to
baptize; because the latter could be done by many, the former only by a
few, of whom he was chief.  And yet we read that he said in certain
places, "My gospel;" <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) but he
never called baptism either his, or any one’s else by whom it was
administered.  For that baptism alone which John gave is called John’s
baptism. <span id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md)   This that man
received as the special pledge of his ministry, that the preparatory
sacrament of washing should even be called by the name of him by whom it
was administered; whereas the baptism which the disciples of Christ
administered was never called by the name of any one of them, that it
should be understood to be His alone of whom it is said, "Christ loved
the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse
it with the washing of water by the word." <span
id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md)   If, therefore, the gospel, which
is Christ’s, but so that a minister also may call it his in virtue of
his office of administering it, can be received by a man even at the
hands of an evil minister without danger to himself, if he does
according to what he says, and not after the example of what he does,
how much more may any one who comes in good faith to Christ receive
without fear of contagion from an evil minister the baptism of Christ,
which none of the apostles so administered as to dare to call it his
own?
