<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—</span>61.  Victoricus of
Thabraca <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707) said:  "If heretics
may baptize, and give remission of sins, why do we destroy their credit,
and call them heretics?" <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxii-p4"></span>62.  What if another were to say: 
If the unrighteous may baptize, and give remission of sins, why do we
destroy their credit, and call them unrighteous?  The answer which we
should give to such an one concerning the unrighteous may also be given
to the other concerning heretics,—that is, in the first place, that the
baptism with which they baptize is not theirs; and secondly, that it
does not follow that whosoever has the baptism of Christ is also certain
of the remission of his sins if he has this only in the outward sign,
and is not converted with a true conversion of the heart, so that he who
gives remission should himself have remission of his sins.
