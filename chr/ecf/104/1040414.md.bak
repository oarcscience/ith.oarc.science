<span id="v.iv.ix.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—</span>28.  Saturninus of
Victoriana <span id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md) said:  "If
heretics may baptize, they are excused and defended in doing unlawful
things; nor do I see why either Christ called them His adversaries, or
the apostle called them antichrists." <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xv-p4"></span>29.  To him we answer:  We say that
heretics have no authority to baptize in the same sense in which we say
that defrauders have no authority to baptize.  For not only to the
heretic, but to the sinner, God says, "What hast thou to do to declare
my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?"  To
the same person He assuredly says, "When thou sawest a thief, then thou
consentedst with him." <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md)   How
much worse, therefore, are those who did not consent with thieves, but
themselves were wont to plunder farms with treacherous deceits?  Yet
Cyprian did not consent with them, though he did tolerate them in the
corn-field of the Catholic Church, lest the wheat should be rooted out
together with it.  And yet at the same time the baptism which they
themselves conferred was the very selfsame baptism, because it was not
of them, but of Christ.  As therefore they, although the baptism of
Christ be recognized in them, were yet not excused and defended in doing
unlawful things, and Christ rightly called those His adversaries who
were destined, by persevering in such things, to hear the doom, "Depart
from me, ye that work iniquity," <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) whence also they are called
antichrists, because they are contrary to Christ while they live in
opposition to His words, so likewise is it the case with heretics.
