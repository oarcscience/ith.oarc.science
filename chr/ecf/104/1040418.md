<span id="v.iv.ix.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—</span>36.  Donatus of
Cibaliana <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) said:  "I
acknowledge one Church, and one baptism that appertains thereto.  If
there is any one who says that the grace of baptism exists among
heretics, he must first show and prove that the Church exists with
them." <span id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xix-p4"></span>37.  To him we answer:  If you say that
the grace of baptism is identical with baptism, then it exists among
heretics; but if baptism is the sacrament or outward sign of grace,
while the grace itself is the abolition of sins, then the grace of
baptism does not exist with heretics.  But so there is one baptism and
one Church, just as there is one faith.  As therefore the good and bad,
not having one hope, can yet have one baptism, so those who have not one
common Church can have one common baptism.
