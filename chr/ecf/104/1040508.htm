&#160; Seeing therefore that Paul, being freed by baptism from the offense of persecution, received again his eyesight freed from guilt, why will not you, a persecutor and <i>traditor</i>, blinded by false baptism be baptized by those whom you persecute?"</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.xxi-p3"></A>48.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.xxi-p3.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; You do not prove that I, whom you wish to baptize afresh, am either a persecutor or a <i>traditor</i>.&#160; And if you prove this charge against any one, yet the persecutor and <i> traditor</i> is not to be baptized afresh, if he had been baptized already with the baptism of Christ.&#160; For the reason why it was necessary that Paul should be baptized was that he had never been washed in any baptism of the kind.&#160;   Therefore what you have chosen to insert about Paul has no point of resemblance with the case which you are arguing with us.&#160; But if you had not inserted this, you would have found no place for your childish declamation, "See how blindness comes in punishment of madness, not to be again expelled except by baptism!"&#160; For with how much more force might one exclaim against you, See how blindness comes in punishment of madness, which, finding its similitude in Simon, not in Paul, is not expelled   from you even when you have received baptism?&#160; For if persecutors ought to be baptized by those whom they persecute, then let Primianus be baptized by the followers of <A NAME="page_542"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 542</FONT></A> <a name="v.v.iv.xxi-Page_542"></A>Maximianus, whom he persecuted with the utmost eagerness.</p>
