said:  "Since then you are not blessed by falsifying the commands of
God, the Lord Christ condemns you by His divine decrees:  ‘Woe unto you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven
against men:  for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them
that are entering to go in.  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when
he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. 
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of
mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of
the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:  these ought ye to have done, and
not to leave the other undone.  Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat,
and swallow a camel.  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful
outwardly, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all
uncleanness.  Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but
within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.’" <span

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxiii-p3"></span>162.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxiii-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Tell me
whether you have said anything which may not equally be said against you
in turn by any slanderous and evil-speaking tongue.  But from what has
been said by me before, any one who wishes may find out that these
things may be said against you, not by way of empty abuse, but with the
support of truthful testimony.  As, however, the opportunity is
presented to us we must not pass this by.  There is no doubt that to the
ancient people of God circumcision stood in the place of baptism.  I
ask, therefore, putting the case that the Pharisees against whom those
words you quote are spoken, had made some proselyte, who, if he were to
imitate them, would, as it is said, become twofold more the child of
hell than themselves, supposing that he were to be converted, and desire
to imitate Simeon, or Zacharias, or Nathanael, would it be necessary
that he should be circumcised again by them?  And if it is absurd to put
this case why, although in empty fashion and with empty sounds you
compare us to men like this, do you nevertheless baptize after us?  But
if you are really men like this, how much better and how much more in
accordance with truth do we act in not baptizing after you, as neither
was it right that those whom I have mentioned should be circumcised
after the worst of Pharisees!  Furthermore, when such men sit in the
seat of Moses, for which the Lord preserved its due honor, why do you
blaspheme the apostolic chair on account of men whom, justly or
unjustly, you compare with these?
