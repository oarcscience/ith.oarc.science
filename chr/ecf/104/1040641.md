<span id="v.v.v.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—</span>53.  Then a little after,
as he had said, "This being so, brethren, what perversity must that be,
that he who is guilty by reason of his own faults should make another
free from guilt, whereas the Lord Jesus Christ says, ‘Every good tree
bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
fruit:  do men gather grapes of thorns?’ <span
id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413.md) and again, ‘A good man, out of the
good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good things:  and an evil
man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things,’" <span
id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414.md) —by which words Petilianus showed
with sufficient clearness, that the man who baptizes is to be looked on
as the tree, and he who is baptized as the fruit:  to this I had
answered, If the good tree is the good baptizer, and his good fruit he
whom he has baptized, then any one who has been baptized by a bad man,
even if his wickedness be not manifest, cannot by any possibility be
good, for he is sprung from an evil tree.  For a good tree is one thing;
a tree whose quality is concealed, but yet bad, is another.  What else
did I wish to be understood by those words, except what I had stated a
little above, that the tree and its fruit do not represent him that
baptizes and him that is baptized; but that the man ought to be received
as signified by the tree, his works and his life by the fruit, which are
always good in the good man, and evil in the evil man, lest this
absurdity should follow, that a man should be bad when baptized by a bad
man, even though his wickedness were concealed, being, as it were, the
fruit of a tree whose quality was unknown, but yet bad?  To which he has
answered nothing whatsoever.
