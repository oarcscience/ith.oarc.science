<span id="v.iv.vii.xiv"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—</span>16.  Accordingly we
find the apostles using the expressions, "My glorying," <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501) though it was certainly in the
Lord; and "Mine office," <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502) and
"My knowledge," <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503) and "My
gospel," <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504) although it was
confessedly bestowed and given by the Lord; but no one of them ever once
said, "My baptism."  For neither is the glorying of all of them equal,
nor do they all minister with equal powers, nor are they all endowed
with equal knowledge, and in preaching the gospel one works more
forcibly than another, and so one may be said to be more learned than
another in the doctrine of salvation itself; but one cannot be said to
be more or less baptized than another, whether he be baptized by a
greater or a less worthy minister.  So when "the works of the flesh are
manifest, which are these, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousnness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, strife, seditions,
heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and <span id="page_470">p.
470</span> <span id="v.iv.vii.xiv-Page_470"></span>such like;" <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505) if it be strange that it should be
said, "Men were baptized after John, and are not baptized after
heretics," why is it not equally strange that it should be said, "Men
were baptized after John, and are not baptized after the envious,"
seeing that Cyprian himself bears witness in his epistle concerning envy
and malignity that the covetous are of the party of the devil, and
Cyprian himself makes it manifest from the words of the Apostle Paul, as
we have shown above, that in the time of the apostles themselves there
were envious persons in the Church of Christ among the very preachers of
the name of Christ?
