<span id="v.iv.vii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—</span>29.  But as to what he
says, that "he who comes to the Church is to be baptized and renewed,
that within he may be hallowed through the holy," <span
id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528.md) what will he do, if within also he
meets with those who are not holy?  Or can it be that the murderer is
holy?  And if the reason for his being baptized in the Church is that
"he should put off this very thing also that he, being a man that sought
to come to God, fell, through the deceit of error, on one
profane," <span id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md) where is he
afterwards to put off this, that he may chance, while seeking a man of
God within the Church itself, to have fallen, through the deceit of
error, on a murderer?  If "there cannot be in a man something that is
void <span id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span
id="v.iv.vii.xxi-Page_474"></span>and something that is valid," <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) why is it possible that in a
murderer the sacrament should be holy and his heart unholy?  If
"whosoever cannot give the Holy Spirit cannot baptize," <span
id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md) why does the murderer baptize
within the Church?  Or how has the murderer the Holy Spirit, when every
one that has the Holy Spirit is filled with light, but "he who hates his
brother is still in darkness?" <span
id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md)   If because "there is one baptism,
and one Spirit," <span id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) therefore
they cannot have the one baptism who have not the one Spirit, why do the
innocent man and the murderer within the Church have the one baptism and
not have the one Spirit?  So therefore the heretic and the Catholic may
have the one baptism, and yet not have the one Church, as in the
Catholic Church the innocent man and the murderer may have the one
baptism, though they have not the one Spirit; for as there is one
baptism, so there is one Spirit and one Church.  And so the result is,
that in each person we must acknowledge what he already has, and to each
person we must give what he has not.  If "nothing can be confirmed and
ratified with God which has been done by those whom God calls His
enemies and foes," <span id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) why is the
baptism confirmed which is given by murderers?  Are we not to call
murderers the enemies and foes of the Lord?  But "he that hateth his
brother is a murderer."  How then did they baptize who hated Paul, the
servant of Jesus Christ, and thereby hated Jesus Himself, since He
Himself said to Saul, "Why persecutest thou me?" <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) when he was persecuting His
servants, and since at the last He Himself shall say, "Inasmuch as ye
did it not to one of the least of these that are mine, ye did it not to
me?" <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md)   Wherefore all who go
out from us are not of us, but not all who are with us are of us; just
as when men thresh, all that flies from the threshing-floor is shown not
to be corn, but not all that remains there is therefore corn.  And so
John too says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if
they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us." <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md)   Wherefore God gives the sacrament
of grace even through the hands of wicked men, but the grace itself only
by Himself or through His saints.  And therefore He gives remission of
sins either of Himself, or through the members of that dove to whom He
says, "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained." <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md)   But since no one can doubt that
baptism, which is the sacrament of the remission of sins, is possessed
even by murderers, who are yet in darkness because the hatred of their
brethren is not excluded from their hearts, therefore either no
remission of sins is given to them if their baptism is accompanied by no
change of heart for the better, or if the sins are remitted, they at
once return on them again.  And we learn that the baptism is holy in
itself, because it is of God; and whether it be given or whether it be
received by men of such like character, it cannot be polluted by any
perversity of theirs, either within, or yet outside the Church.
