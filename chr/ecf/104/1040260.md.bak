<span id="v.iv.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—</span>27.  On the question
of bap<span id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xviii-Page_423"></span>tism, then, I think that I have
argued at sufficient length; and since this is a most manifest schism
which is called by the name of the Donatists, it only remains that on
the subject of baptism we should believe with pious faith what the
universal Church maintains, apart from the sacrilege of schism.  And
yet, if within the Church different men still held different opinions on
the point, without meanwhile violating peace, then till some one clear
and simple decree should have been passed by an universal Council, it
would have been right for the charity which seeks for unity to throw a
veil over the error of human infirmity, as it is written "For charity
shall cover the multitude of sins." <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md)   For, seeing that its absence
causes the presence of all other things to be of no avail, we may well
suppose that in its presence there is found pardon for the absence of
some missing things.

<span id="v.iv.iii.xviii-p3"></span>28.  There are great proofs of this
existing on the part of the blessed martyr Cyprian, in his letters,—to
come at last to him of whose authority they carnally flatter themselves
they are possessed, whilst by his love they are spiritually overthrown. 
For at that time, before the consent of the whole Church had declared
authoritatively, by the decree of a plenary Council, <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md) what practice should be followed in
this matter, it seemed to him, in common with about eighty of his fellow
bishops of the African churches, that every man who had been baptized
outside the communion of the Catholic Church should, on joining the
Church, be baptized anew.  And I take it, that the reason why the Lord
did not reveal the error in this to a man of such eminence, was, that
his pious humility and charity in guarding the peace and health of the
Church might be made manifest, and might be noticed, so as to serve as
an example of healing power, so to speak, not only to Christians of that
age, but also to those who should come after.  For when a bishop of so
important a Church, himself a man of so great merit and virtue, endowed
with such excellence of heart and power of eloquence, entertained an
opinion about baptism different from that which was to be confirmed by a
more diligent searching into the truth; though many of his colleagues
held what was not yet made manifest by authority, but was sanctioned by
the past custom of the Church, and afterwards embraced by the whole
Catholic world; yet under these circumstances he did not sever himself,
by refusal of communion, from the others who thought differently, and
indeed never ceased to urge on the others that they should "forbear one
another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace." <span id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md)   For so, while
the framework of the body remained whole, if any infirmity occurred in
certain of its members, it might rather regain its health from their
general soundness, than be deprived of the chance of any healing care by
their death in severance from the body.  And if he had severed himself,
how many were there to follow! what a name was he likely to make for
himself among men! how much more widely would the name of Cyprianist
have spread than that of Donatist!  But he was not a son of perdition,
one of those of whom it is said, "Thou castedst them down while they
were elevated;" <span id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) but he was
the son of the peace of the Church, who in the clear illumination of his
mind failed to see one thing, only that through him another thing might
be more excellently seen.  "And yet," says the apostle, "show I unto you
a more excellent way:  though I speak with the tongues of men and of
angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
tinkling cymbal." <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md)   He had
therefore imperfect insight into the hidden mystery of the sacrament. 
But if he had known the mysteries of all sacraments, without having
charity, it would have been nothing.  But as he, with imperfect insight
into the mystery, was careful to preserve charity with all courage and
humility and faith, he deserved to come to the crown of martyrdom; so
that, if any cloud had crept over the clearness of his intellect from
his infirmity as man, it might be dispelled by the glorious brightness
of his blood.  For it was not in vain that our Lord Jesus Christ, when
He declared Himself to be the vine, and His disciples, as it were, the
branches in the vine, gave command that those which bare no fruit should
be cut off, and removed from the vine as useless branches. <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md)   But what is really fruit, save
that new offspring, of which He further says, "A new commandment I give
unto you, that ye love one another?" <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md)   This is that very charity,
without which the rest profiteth nothing.  The apostle also says:  "But
the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance;" <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) which all begin with charity, and
with the rest of the combination forms one unity in a kind of wondrous
cluster. <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md)   Nor is it again in
vain that our Lord added, "And every branch that beareth fruit, my
Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit," <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) but because those who are <span
id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xviii-Page_424"></span>strong in the fruit of charity may
yet have something which requires purging, which the Husbandman will not
leave untended.  Whilst then, that holy man entertained on the subject
of baptism an opinion at variance with the true view, which was
afterwards thoroughly examined and confirmed after most diligent
consideration, his error was compensated by his remaining in catholic
unity, and by the abundance of his charity; and finally it was cleared
away by the pruning-hook of martyrdom.
