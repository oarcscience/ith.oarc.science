id="iv.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—If Evil is Defined to Be
Corruption, This Completely Refutes the Manichæan Heresy.</span>

<span id="iv.v.vii-p2"></span>7.  I ask a third time, What is evil? 
Perhaps you will reply, Corruption.  Undeniably this is a general
definition of evil; for corruption implies opposition to nature, and
also hurt.  But corruption exists not by itself, but in some substance
which it corrupts; for corruption itself is not a substance.  So the
thing which it corrupts is not corruption, is not evil; for what is
corrupted suffers the loss of integrity and purity.  So that which has
no purity to lose cannot be corrupted; and what has, is necessarily good
by the participation of purity.  Again, what is corrupted is perverted;
and what is perverted suffers the loss of order, and order is good.  To
be corrupted, then, does not imply the absence of good; for in
corruption it can be deprived of good, which could not be if there was
the absence of good.  Therefore that race of darkness, if it was
destitute of all good, as you say it was, could not be corrupted, for it
had nothing which corruption could take from it; and if corruption takes
nothing away, it does not corrupt.  Say now, if you dare, that God and
the kingdom of God can be corrupted, when you cannot show how the
kingdom of the devil, such as you make it, can be corrupted.
