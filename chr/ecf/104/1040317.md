<span id="v.iv.vi.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—</span>27.  Let us therefore
not flatter the Catholic who is hemmed in with all these vices, nor
venture, merely because he is a Catholic Christian, to promise him the
impunity which holy Scripture does not prom<span id="page_459">p.
459</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.xix-Page_459"></span>ise him; nor, if he
has any one of the faults above mentioned, ought we to promise him a
partnership in that heavenly land.  For, in writing to the Corinthians,
the apostle enumerates the several sins, under each of which it is
implicitly understood that it shall not inherit the kingdom of God:  "Be
not deceived," he says:  "neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
shall inherit the kingdom of God." <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md)   He does not say, those who
possess all these vices together shall not inherit the kingdom of God;
but neither these nor those:  so that, as each is named, you may
understand that no one of them shall inherit the kingdom of God.  As,
therefore, heretics shall not possess the kingdom of God, so the
covetous shall not inherit the kingdom of God.  Nor can we indeed doubt
that the punishments themselves, with which they shall be tortured who
do not inherit the kingdom of God, will vary in proportion to the
difference of their offences, and that some will be more severe than
others; so that in the eternal fire itself there will be different
tortures in the punishments, corresponding to the different weights of
guilt.  For indeed it was not idly that the Lord said, "It shall be more
tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for
thee." <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md)   But yet, so far as
failing to inherit the kingdom of God is concerned, it is just as
certain, if you choose any one of the less heinous of these vices, as if
you choose more than one, or some one which you saw was more atrocious;
and because those will inherit the kingdom of God whom the Judge shall
set on His right hand, and for those who shall not be found worthy to be
set at the right hand nothing will remain but to be at the left, no
other announcement is left for them to hear like goats from the mouth of
the Shepherd, except, "Depart into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his angels;" <span id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) though
in that fire, as I said before, it may be that different punishments
will be awarded corresponding to the difference of the sins.
