<span id="v.iv.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—</span>26.  Therefore,
whether they seem to abide within, or are openly outside, whatsoever is
flesh is flesh, and what is chaff is chaff, whether they persevere in
remaining in their barrenness on the threshing-floor, or, when
temptation befalls them, are carried out as it were by the blast of some
wind.  And even that man is always severed from the unity of the Church
which is without spot or wrinkle,  <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194) who associates with the
congregation of the saints in carnal obstinacy.  Yet we ought to despair
of no man, whether he be one who shows himself to be of this nature
within the pale of the Church, or whether he more openly opposes it from
without.  But the spiritual, or those who are steadily advancing with
pious exertion towards this end, do not stray without the pale; since
even when, by some perversity or necessity among men, they seem to be
driven forth, they are more approved than if they had remained within,
since they are in no degree roused to contend against the Church, but
remain rooted in the strongest foundation of Christian charity on the
solid rock of unity.  For hereunto belongs what is said in the sacrifice
of Abraham:  "But the birds divided he not." <span

<span id="v.iv.iii.xvii-p2"></span> In the *Retractations*, ii. 18,
Augustin notes on this passage, that wherever he uses this quotation
from the Epistle to the Ephesians, he means it to be understood of the
progress of the Church towards this condition, and not of her success in
its attainment; for at present the infirmities and ignorance of her
members give ground enough for the whole Church joining daily in the
petition, "Forgive us our debts."
