<span id="v.v.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—</span>25.  In conclusion,
the Testament is said to have been given to the flames by certain men in
the time of persecution.  Now let its lessons be read, from whatever
source it has been brought to light.  Certainly in the beginning of the
promises of the Testator this is found to have been said to Abraham: 
"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;" <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) and this saying is truthfully
interpreted by the apostle:  "To thy seed," he says, "which is
Christ." <span id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md)   No betrayal on the
part of any man has made the promises of God of none effect.  Hold
communion with all the nations of the earth, and then you may boast that
you have preserved the Testament from the destruction of the flames. 
But if you will not do so, which party is the rather to be believed to
have insisted on the burning of the Testament, save that which will not
assent to its teaching when it is brought to light?  For how much more
certainly, without any sacrilegious rashness, can he be held to have
joined the company of *traditors* who now persecutes with his tongue the
Testament which they are said to have persecuted with the flames!  You
charge us with the persecution:  the true wheat of the Lord answers you,
"Either it was done justly, or it was done by the chaff that was among
us."  What have you to say to this?  You object that we have no
baptism:  the same true wheat of the Lord answers you, that the form of
the sacrament even within the Church fails to profit some, as it did no
good to Simon Magus when he was baptized, much more it fails to profit
those who are without.  Yet that baptism remains in them when they
depart, is proved from this, that it is not restored to them when they
return.  Never, therefore, except by the greatest shamelessness, will
you be able to cry out against that wheat, or to call them false <span

whilst inwardly they are ravening wolves; since either they do not know
the wicked in the unity of the Catholic Church, or for the sake of unity
bear with those whom they know.
