<span id="iv.viii.iv-p2"></span>3.  For my part, I,—who, after much and
long-continued bewilderment, attained at last, to the discovery of the
simple truth, which is learned without being recorded in any fanciful
legend; who, unhappy that I was, barely succeeded, by God’s help, in
refuting the vain imaginations of my mind, gathered from theories and
errors of various kinds; who so late sought the cure of my mental
obscuration, in compliance with the call and the tender persuasion of
the all-merciful Physician; who long wept that the immutable and
inviolable Existence would vouchsafe to convince me inwardly of Himself,
in harmony with the testimony of the sacred books; by whom, in fine, all
those fictions which have such a firm hold on you, from your long
familiarity with them, were diligently examined, and attentively heard,
and too easily believed, and commended at every opportunity to the
belief of others, and defended against opponents with determination and
boldness,—I can on no account rage against you; for I must bear with you
now as formerly I had to bear with myself, and I must be as patient
towards you as my associates were with me, when I went madly and blindly
astray in your beliefs.

that you owe it to me, in return, to lay aside all arrogance on your
part too, that so you may be the more disposed to gentleness, and may
not oppose me in a hostile spirit, to your own hurt.  Let neither of us
assert that he has found truth; let us seek it as if it were unknown to
us both.  For truth can be sought with zeal and unanimity if by no rash
presumption it is believed to have been already found and ascertained. 
But if I cannot induce you to grant me this, at least allow me to
suppose myself a stranger now for the first time hearing you, for the
first time examining your doctrines.  I think my demand a just one.  And
it must be laid down as an understood thing that I am not to join you in
your prayers, or in holding conventicles, or in taking the name of
Manichæus, unless you give me a clear explanation, without any
obscurity, of all matters touching the salvation of the soul.
