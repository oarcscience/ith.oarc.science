id="iv.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Man’s Chief Good is Not the Chief
Good of the Body Only, But the Chief Good of the Soul.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p2"></span>7.  Now if we ask what is the chief good
of the body, reason obliges us to admit that it is that by means of
which the body comes to be in its best state.  But of all the things
which invigorate the body, there is nothing better or greater than the
soul.  The chief good of the body, then, is not bodily pleasure, not
absence of pain, not strength, not beauty, not swiftness, or whatever
else is usually reckoned among the goods of the body, but simply the
soul.  For all the things mentioned the soul supplies to the body by its
presence, and, what is above them all, life.  Hence I conclude that the
soul is not the chief good of man, whether we give the name of man to
soul and body together, or to the soul alone.  For as according to
reason, the chief good of the body is that which is better than the
body, and from which the body receives vigor and life, so whether the
soul itself is man, or soul and body both, we must discover whether
there is anything which goes before the soul itself, in following which
the soul comes to the perfection of good of which it is capable in its
own kind.  If such a thing can be found, all uncertainty must be at an
end, and we must pronounce this to be really and truly the chief good of
man.

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p3"></span>8.  If, again, the body is man, it must
be admitted that the soul is the chief good of man.  But clearly, when
we treat of morals,—when we inquire what manner of life must be held in
order to obtain happiness,—it is not the body to which the precepts are
addressed, it is not bodily discipline which we discuss.  In short, the
observance of good *customs* belongs to that part of us which inquires
and learns, which are the prerogatives of the soul; so, when we speak of
attaining to virtue, the question does not regard the body.  But if it
follows, as it does, that the body which is ruled over by a soul
possessed of virtue is ruled both better and more honorably, and is in
its greatest perfection in consequence of the perfection of the soul
which rightfully governs it, that which gives perfection to the soul
will be man’s chief good, though we call the body man.  For if my
coachman, in obedience to me, feeds and drives the horses he has charge
of in the most satisfactory manner, himself enjoying the more of my
bounty in proportion to his good conduct, can any one deny that the good
condition of the horses, as well as that of the coachman, is due to me? 
So the question seems to me to be not, whether soul and body is man, or
the soul only, or the body only, but what gives perfection to the soul;
for when this is obtained, a man cannot but be either perfect, or at
least much better than in the absence of this one thing.
