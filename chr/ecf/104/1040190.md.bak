id="iv.x.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Nature Which Cannot Be Corrupted
is the Highest Good; That Which Can, is Some Good.</span>

<span id="iv.x.viii-p2"></span>But if corruption take away all measure,
all form, all order from corruptible things, no nature will remain.  And
consequently every nature which cannot be corrupted is the highest good,
as is God.  But every nature that can be corrupted is also itself some
good; for corruption cannot injure it, except by taking away from or
diminishing that which is good.
