id="iv.x.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—"From Him" And "Of Him" Do Not
Mean The Same Thing.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxix-p2"></span>But "from Him" does not mean the same as
"of Him." <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md)   For what is of
Him may be said to be from Him; but not everything that is from Him is
rightly said to be of Him.  For from Him are heaven and earth, because
He made them; but not of Him because they are not of His substance.  As
in the case of a man who begets a son and makes a house, from himself is
the son, from himself is the house, but the son is of him, the house is
of earth and wood.  But this is so, because as a man he cannot make
something even of nothing; but God of whom are all things, through whom
are all things, in whom are all things, had no need of any material
which He had not made to assist His omnipotence.
