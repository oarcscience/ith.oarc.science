<span id="v.v.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—</span>19.  Let him go now, and
with panting lungs and swollen throat find fault with me as a mere
dialectician.  Nay, let him summon, not me, but the science of
dialectics itself, to the bar of popular opinion as a forger <span
id="page_604">p. 604</span> <span id="v.v.v.xvi-Page_604"></span>of
lies, and let him open his mouth to its widest against it, with all the
noisiest uproar of a special pleader.  Let him say whatever he pleases
before the inexperienced, that so the learned may be moved to wrath,
while the ignorant are deceived.  Let him call me, in virtue of my
rhetoric, by the name of the orator Tertullus, by whom Paul was
accused; <span id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) and let him give
himself the name of Advocate, <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md)
in virtue of the pleading in which he boasts his former power, and for
this reason delude himself with the notion that he is, or rather was, a
namesake of the Holy Ghost.  Let him, with all my heart, exaggerate the
foulness of the Manichæans, and endeavor to divert it on to me by his
barking.  Let him quote all the exploits of those who have been
condemned, whether known or unknown to me; and let him turn into the
calumnious imputation of a prejudged crime, by some new right entirely
his own, the fact that a former friend of mine there named me in my
absence to the better securing of his own defense.  Let him read the
titles that have been placed upon my letters by himself or by his
friends, as suited their pleasure, and boast that he has, as it were,
involved me hopelessly in their expressions.  When I acknowledge certain
eulogies of bread, uttered in all simplicity and merriment, let him take
away my character with the absurd imputations of poisonous baseness and
madness.  And let him entertain so bad an opinion of your understanding,
as to imagine that he can be believed when he declares that pernicious
love-charms were given to a woman, not only with the knowledge, but
actually with the complicity <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md)
of her husband.  What the man who was afterwards to ordain me
bishop <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) wrote about me in
anger, while I was as yet a priest, he may freely seek to use as
evidence against me.  That the same man sought and obtained forgiveness
from a holy Council for the wrong he thus had done me, he is equally at
liberty to ignore as being in my favor,—being either so ignorant or so
forgetful of Christian gentleness, and the commandment of the gospel,
that he brings as an accusation against a brother what is wholly unknown
to that brother himself, as he humbly entreats that pardon may in
kindness be extended to him.

<span id="v.v.v.xvi-p5"></span> Megalius, bishop of Calama, primate of
Numidia, was the bishop who ordained Augustin, as we find in c. viii. of
his life by Possidius.  Augustin makes further reply to the same
calumny, which was gathered from a letter of Megalius, in *Contra
Cresconium*, Book III. c. 80, 92, and Book IV. c. 64, 78, 79.
