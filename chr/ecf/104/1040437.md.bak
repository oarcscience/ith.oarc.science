<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—</span>74.  Felix of
Gurgites <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) said:  "I give my
judgment, that, according to the precepts of the holy Scriptures, those
who have been unlawfully baptized outside the Church by heretics, if
they wish to flee to the Church, should obtain the grace of baptism
where it is lawfully given." <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxviii-p4"></span>75.  Our answer is:  Let them
indeed begin to have in a lawful manner to salvation what they before
had unlawfully to destruction; because each man is justified under the
same baptism, when he has turned himself to God with a true heart, as
that under which he was condemned, when on receiving it he "renounced
the world in words alone, and not in deeds."
