<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—</span>67.  Castus of
Sicca <span id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722.md) said:  He who presumes
to follow custom in despite of truth is either envious and evilly
disposed towards the brethren to whom the truth is revealed, or else he
is ungrateful towards God, by whose inspiration His Church is
instructed." <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxv-p4"></span>68.  If this man proved that those
who differed from him, and held the view that has since been held by the
whole world under the sanction of a Christian Council, were following
custom so as to despise truth, we should have reason for fearing these
words; but seeing that this custom is found both to have had its origin
in truth and to have been confirmed by truth, we have nothing to fear in
this judgment.  And yet, if they were envious or evilly disposed towards
the brethren, or ungrateful towards God, see with what kind of men they
were willing to hold communion; see what kind of men, holding different
opinions from their own, they treated as Cyprian enjoined them at the
first, not removing them from the right of communion; see by what kind
of men they were not polluted in the preservation of unity; see how
greatly the bond of peace was to be loved; see what views they hold who
bring charges against us, founded on the Council of bishops, their
predecessors, whose example they do not imitate, and by whose example,
when the rights of the case are considered, they are condemned.  If it
was the custom, as this judgment bears witness, that heretics coming to
the Church should be received with the baptism which they already had,
either this was done rightly, or the evil do not pollute the good in
unity.  If it was rightly done, why do they accuse the world because
they are so received?  But if the evil do not pollute the good in unity,
how do they defend themselves against the charge of sacrilegious
separation?
