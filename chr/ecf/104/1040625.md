<span id="v.v.v.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—</span>33.  This is what we
look upon with horror in your party; this is what the sentence of God
condemns, crying out with the utmost truth and the utmost clearness,
"Cursed is every one that trusteth in man." <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md)   This is what is most openly
forbidden by holy humility and apostolic love, as Paul declares, "Let no
man glory in men." <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md)   This is
the reason that the attack of empty calumnies and <span id="page_610">p.
610</span> <span id="v.v.v.xxviii-Page_610"></span>of the bitterest
invectives grows even fiercer against us, that when human authority is
as it were overthrown, there may remain no ground of hope for those to
whom we administer the word and sacrament of God in accordance with the
dispensation entrusted unto us.  We make answer to them:  How long do
you rest your support on man?  The venerable society of the Catholic
Church makes answer to them:  "Truly my soul waiteth upon God:  from Him
cometh my salvation.  He only is my God and my helper; I shall not be
moved." <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md)   For what other
reason have they had for removing from the house of God, except that
they pretended that they could not endure those vessels made to
dishonor, from which the house shall not be free until the day of
judgment? whereas all the time they rather appear, by their deeds and by
the records of the time, to have themselves been vessels of this kind,
while they threw the imputation in the teeth of others; of which said
vessels made unto dishonor, in order that no one should on their account
remove in confusion of mind from the great house, which alone belongs to
the great Father of our family, the servant of God, one who was good and
faithful, or was capable of receiving faith in baptism, as I have shown
above, expressly says, "Truly my soul waiteth upon God" (on God, you
see, and not on man):  "from Him cometh my salvation" (not from man). 
But Petilianus would refuse to ascribe to God the cleansing and
purifying of a man, even when the stain upon the conscience of him who
gives, but not in holiness, is hidden from view, and any one receives
his faith unwittingly from one that is faithless.  "I tell you this," he
says, "as shortly as I can:  you were bound both to examine your
baptizer, and to be examined by him."
