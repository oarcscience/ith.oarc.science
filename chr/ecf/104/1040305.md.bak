<span id="v.iv.vi.vii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—</span>11.  For in fact, as to
what some opposed to the reasoning of Cyprian, that the apostle says,
"Notwithstanding every way, whether in pretence or in truth, let Christ
be preached;" <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md) Cyprian rightly
exposed their error, showing that it has nothing to do with the case of
heretics, since the apostle was speaking of those who were acting within
the Church, with malicious envy seeking their own profit.  They
announced Christ, indeed, according to the truth whereby we believe in
Christ, but not in the spirit in which He was announced by the good
evangelists to the sons of the dove.  "For Paul," he says, "in his
epistle was not speaking of heretics, or of their baptism, so that it
could be shown that he had laid down anything concerning this matter. 
He was speaking of brethren, whether as walking disorderly and contrary
to the discipline of the Church, or as keeping the discipline of the
Church in the fear of God.  And he declared that some of them spoke the
word of God steadfastly and fearlessly, but that some were acting in
envy and strife; that some had kept themselves encompassed with kindly
Christian love, but that others entertained malice and strife:  but yet
that he patiently endured all things, with the view that, whether in
truth or in pretence, the name of Christ, which Paul preached, might
come to the knowledge of the greatest number, and that the sowing of the
word, which was as yet a new and unaccustomed work, might spread more
widely by the preaching of those that spoke.  Furthermore, it is one
thing for those who are within the Church to speak in the name of
Christ, another thing for those who are without, acting against the
Church, to baptize in the name of Christ." <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md)   These words of Cyprian seem to
warn us that we must distinguish between those who are bad outside, and
those who are bad within the Church.  And those whom he says that the
apostle represents as preaching the gospel impurely and of envy, he says
truly were within.  This much, however, I think I may say without
rashness, if no one outside can have anything which is of Christ,
neither can any one within have anything which is of the devil.  For if
that closed garden can contain the thorns of the devil, why cannot the
fountain of Christ equally flow beyond the garden’s bounds?  But if it
cannot contain them, whence, even in the time of the Apostle Paul
himself, did there arise amongst those who were within so great an evil
of envy and malicious strife?  For these are the words of Cyprian.  Can
it be that envy and malicious strife are a small evil?  How then were
those in unity who were not at peace?  For it is not my voice, nor that
of any man, but of the Lord Himself; nor did the sound go forth from
men, but from angels, at the birth of Christ, "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace to men of good will." <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md)   And this certainly would not have
been proclaimed by the voice of angels when Christ was born upon the
earth, unless God wished this to be understood, that those are in the
unity of the body of Christ who are united in the peace of Christ, and
those are in the peace of Christ who are of good will.  Furthermore, as
good will is shown in kindliness, so is bad will shown in malice.
