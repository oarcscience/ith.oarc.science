<span id="v.iv.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—</span>10.  Nor indeed were
the prayers of the Gentile Cornelius unheard, nor did his alms lack
acceptance; nay, he was found worthy that an angel should be sent to
him, and that he should behold the messenger, through whom he might
assuredly have learned everything that was necessary, without requiring
that any man should come to him.  But since all the good that he had in
his prayers and alms could not benefit him unless he were incorporated
in the Church by the bond of Christian brotherhood and peace, he was
ordered to send to Peter, and through him learned Christ; and, being
also baptized by his orders, he was joined by the tie of communion to
the fellowship of Christians, to which before he was bound only by the
likeness of good works. <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md)   And
indeed it would have been most fatal to despise what he did not yet
possess, vaunting himself in what he had.  So too those who, by
separating themselves from the society of their fellows, to the
overthrow of charity, thus break the bond of unity, if they observe none
of the things which they have received in that society, are separated in
everything; and so any one whom they have joined to their society, if he
afterwards wish to come over to the Church, ought to receive everything
which he has not already received.  But if they observe some of the same
things, in respect of these they have not severed themselves; and so far
they are still a part of the framework of the Church, while in all other
respects they are cut off from it.  Accordingly, any one whom they have
associated with themselves is united to the Church in all those points
in which they are not separated from it.  And therefore, if he wish to
come over to the Church, he is made sound in those points in which he
was unsound and went astray; but where he was sound in union with the
Church, he is not cured, but recognized,—lest in desiring to cure what
is sound we should rather inflict a wound.  Therefore those whom they
baptize they heal from the wound of idolatry or unbelief; but they
injure them more seriously with the wound of schism. <span
id="page_417">p. 417</span> <span id="v.iv.iii.viii-Page_417"></span>For
idolaters among the people of the Lord were smitten with the
sword; <span id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) but schismatics were
swallowed up by the earth opening her mouth. <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md)   And the apostle says, "Though I
have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity,
I am nothing." <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md)

<span id="v.iv.iii.viii-p6"></span>11.  If any one is brought to the
surgeon, afflicted with a grievous wound in some vital part of the body,
and the surgeon says that unless it is cured it must cause death, the
friends who brought him do not, I presume, act so foolishly as to count
over to the surgeon all his sound limbs, and, drawing his attention to
them, make answer to him, "Can it be that all these sound limbs are of
no avail to save his life, and that one wounded limb is enough to cause
his death?"  They certainly do not say this, but they entrust him to the
surgeon to be cured.  Nor, again, because they so entrust him, do they
ask the surgeon to cure the limbs that are sound as well; but they
desire him to apply drugs with all care to the one part from which death
is threatening the other sound parts too, with the certainty that it
must come, unless the wound be healed.  What will it then profit a man
that he has sound faith, or perhaps only soundness in the sacrament of
faith, when the soundness of his charity is done away with by the fatal
wound of schism, so that by the overthrow of it the other points, which
were in themselves sound, are brought into the infection of death?  To
prevent which, the mercy of God, through the unity of His holy Church,
does not cease striving that they may come and be healed by the medicine
of reconciliation, through the bond of peace.  And let them not think
that they are sound because we admit that they have something sound in
them; nor let them think, on the other hand, that what is sound must
needs be healed, because we show that in some parts there is a wound. 
So that in the soundness of the sacrament, because they are not against
us, they are for us; but in the wound of schism, because they gather not
with Christ, they scatter abroad.  Let them not be exalted by what they
have.  Why do they pass the eyes of pride over those parts only which
are sound?  Let them condescend also to look humbly on their wound, and
give heed not only to what they have, but also to what is wanting in
them.
