<span id="v.iv.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—</span>15.  They ask also,
"Whether sins are remitted in baptism in the party of Donatus:"  so
that, if we say that they are remitted, they may answer, then the Holy
Spirit is there; for when by the breathing of our Lord the Holy Spirit
was given to the disciples, He then went on to say, "Baptize all nations
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178)   Whose soever sins ye remit, they
are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are
retained." <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179)   And if it is so,
they say, then our communion is the Church of Christ; for the Holy
Spirit does not work the remission of sins except in the Church.  And if
our communion is the Church of Christ, then your communion is not the
Church of Christ.  For that is one, wherever it is, of which it is said,
"My dove is but one; she is the only one of her mother;" <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180) nor can there be just so many
churches as there are schisms.  But if we should say that sins are not
there remitted, then, say they, there is no true baptism there; and
therefore ought you to baptize those whom you receive from us.  And
since you do not do this, you confess that you are not in the Church of
Christ.

<span id="v.iv.iii.xi-p5"></span>16.  To these we reply, following the
Scriptures, by asking them to answer themselves what they ask of us. 
For I beg them to tell <span id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.xi-Page_419"></span>us whether there is any remission of
sins where there is not charity; for sins are the darkness of the soul. 
For we find St. John saying, "He that hateth his brother is still in
darkness." <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181)   But none would
create schisms, if they were not blinded by hatred of their brethren. 
If, therefore, we say that sins are not remitted there, how is he
regenerate who is baptized among them?  And what is regeneration in
baptism, except the being renovated from the corruption of the old man? 
And how can he be so renovated whose past sins are not remitted?  But if
he be not regenerate, neither does he put on Christ; from which it seems
to follow that he ought to be baptized again.  For the apostle says,
"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Christ;" <span id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182) and if he has not so
put on Christ, neither should he be considered to have been baptized in
Christ.  Further, since we say that he has been baptized in Christ, we
confess that he has put on Christ; and if we confess this, we confess
that he is regenerate.  And if this be so, how does St. John say, "He
that hateth his brother remaineth still in darkness," if remission of
his sins has already taken place?  Can it be that schism does not
involve hatred of one’s brethren?  Who will maintain this, when both the
origin of, and perseverance in schism consists in nothing else save
hatred of the brethren?

<span id="v.iv.iii.xi-p8"></span>17.  They think that they solve this
question when they say:  "There is then no remission of sins in schism,
and therefore no creation of the new man by regeneration, and
accordingly neither is there the baptism of Christ."  But since we
confess that the baptism of Christ exists in schism, we propose this
question to them for solution:  Was Simon Magus endued with the true
baptism of Christ?  They will answer, Yes; being compelled to do so by
the authority of holy Scripture.  I ask them whether they confess that
he received remission of his sins.  They will certainly acknowledge it. 
So I ask why Peter said to him that he had no part in the lot of the
saints.  Because, they say, he sinned afterwards, wishing to buy with
money the gift of God, which he believed the apostles were able to sell.
