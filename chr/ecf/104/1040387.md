<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—</span>63.  Another Felix
of Uthina <span id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709) said:  "No one can
doubt, most holy brethren in the priesthood, that human presumption has
not so much power as the adorable and venerable majesty of our Lord
Jesus Christ.  Remembering then the danger, we ought not only to observe
this ourselves, but to confirm it by our general consent, that all
heretics who come to the bosom of our mother the Church be baptized,
that the heretical mind, which has been polluted by long-continued
corruption, may be reformed when cleansed by the sanctification of the
laver." <span id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxiii-p4"></span>64.  Perhaps the man who has
placed the strength of his case for the baptizing of heretics in the
cleansing away of the long-continued corruption, would spare those who,
having fallen headlong into some heresy, had remained in it a brief
space, and presently being corrected, had passed from thence to the
Catholic Church.  Furthermore, he has himself failed to observe that it
might be said that all unrighteous persons who come to that rock, in
which is understood the Church, should be baptized, so that the
unrighteous mind, which was building outside the rock upon the sand by
hearing the words of Christ and not doing them, might be reformed when
cleansed by the sanctification of the laver; and yet this is not done if
they have been baptized already, even if it be proved that such was
their character when they were baptized, that is, that they "renounced
the world in words and not in deeds."

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxiii-p2"></span> Uthina was in ecclesiastical
province of Zeugitana.  This Felix is to be distinguished from the
bishop of Bagai, ch. 19:  A reference to a bishop of Utina is made by
Tert. de Monog. ch. xii., but he cannot have been this Felix, as some
assume.
