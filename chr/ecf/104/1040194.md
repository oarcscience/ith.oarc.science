id="iv.x.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Natures Corruptible, Because Made
of Nothing.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xii-p2"></span>All corruptible natures therefore are
natures at all only so far as they are *from* God, nor would they be
corruptible if they were *of* Him; because they would be what He himself
is.  Therefore of whatever measure, of whatever form, of whatever order,
they are, they are so because it is God by whom they were made; but they
are not immutable, because it is nothing of which they were made.  For
it is sacrilegious audacity to make nothing and God equal, as when we
wish to make what has been born of God such as what has been made by Him
out of nothing.
