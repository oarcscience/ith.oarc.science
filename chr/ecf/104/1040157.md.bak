<span id="iv.ix.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="iv.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Book IX.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p2"></span>Faustus argues that if the apostles born
under the old covenant could lawfully depart from it, much more can he
having been born a Gentile.  Augustin explains the relation of Jews and
Gentiles alike to the Gospel.

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xi-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  Another reason for not
receiving the Old Testament is, that if it was allowable for the
apostles, who were born under it, to abandon it, much more may I, who
was not born under it, be excused for not thrusting myself into it.  We
Gentiles are <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xi-Page_176"></span>not born Jews, nor Christians either.  Out
of the same Gentile world some are induced by the Old Testament to
become Jews, and some by the New Testament to become Christians.  It is
as if two trees, a sweet and a bitter, drew from one soil the sap which
each assimilates to its own nature.  The apostle passed from the bitter
to the sweet; it would be madness in me to change from the sweet to the
bitter.

<span id="iv.ix.xi-p4"></span>2.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xi-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  You say that the
apostle, in leaving Judaism, passed from the bitter to the sweet.  But
the apostle himself says that the Jews, who would not believe in Christ,
were branches broken off, and that the Gentiles, a wild olive tree, were
grafted into the good olive, that is, the holy stock of the Hebrews,
that they might partake of the fatness of the olive.  For, in warning
the Gentiles not to be proud on account of the fall of the Jews, he
says:  "For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the
Gentiles.  I magnify my office; if by any means I may provoke to
emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.  For if
the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the
receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  For if the first fruit be
holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root be holy, so are the
branches.  And if some of the branches are broken off, and thou, being a
wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partakest of
the root and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the branches: 
but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  Thou
wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted
in.  Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest
by faith.  Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God spared not the
natural branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee.  Behold
therefore the goodness and severity of God:  on them which fell,
severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His goodness;
otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.  And they also, if they abide not
still in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in
again.  For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by
nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how
much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into
their own olive tree?  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be
ignorant of this mystery (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits),
that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the
Gentiles be come in; and so all Israel shall be saved." <span
id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md)   It appears from this, that you, who
do not wish to be graffed into this root, though you are not broken off,
like the carnal unbelieving Jews, remain still in the bitterness of the
wild olive.  Your worship of the sun and moon has the true Gentile
flavor.  You are none the less in the wild olive of the Gentiles,
because you have added thorns of a new kind, and worship along with the
sun and moon a false Christ, the fabrication not of your hands, but of
your perverse heart.  Come, then, and be grafted into the root of the
olive tree, in his return to which the apostle rejoices, after by
unbelief he had been among the broken branches.  He speaks of himself as
set free, when he made the happy transition from Judaism to
Christianity.  For Christ was always preached in the olive tree, and
those who did not believe on Him when He came were broken off, while
those who believed were grafted in.  These are thus warned against
pride:  "Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural
branches, neither will He spare thee."  And to prevent despair of those
broken off, he adds:  "And they also, if they abide not still in
unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. 
For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and
wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more
shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own
olive tree."  The apostle rejoices in being delivered from the condition
of a broken branch, and in being restored to the fatness of the olive
tree.  So you who have been broken off by error should return and be
grafted in again.  Those who are still in the wild olive should separate
themselves from its barrenness, and become partakers of fertility.
