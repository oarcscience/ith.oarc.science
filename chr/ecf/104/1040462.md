<span id="v.v.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>6.  We ask, therefore,
since he says, "He who receives faith from the faithless receives not
faith, but guilt," and immediately adds to this the further statement,
that "everything consists of an origin and root; and if it have not
something for a head, it is nothing;"—we ask, I say, in a case where the
faithlessness of the baptizer is undetected:  If then, the man whom he
baptizes receives faith, and not guilt; if, then, the baptizer is not
his origin and root and head, who is it from whom he receives faith?
where is the origin from which he springs? where is the root of which he
is a shoot? where the head which is his starting-point?  Can it be, that
when he who is baptized is unaware of the faithlessness of his baptizer,
it is then Christ who gives faith, it is then Christ who is the origin
and root and head?  Alas for human rashness and conceit!  Why do you not
allow that it is always Christ who gives faith, for the purpose of
making a man a Christian by giving it?  Why do you not allow that Christ
is always the origin of the Christian, that the Christian always plants
his root in Christ, that Christ is the head of the Christian?  Do we
then maintain that, even when spiritual grace is dispensed to those that
believe by the hands of a holy and faithful minister, it is still not
the minister himself who justifies, but that One of whom it is said,
that "He justifieth the ungodly?"  <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926)   But unless we admit this, either
the Apostle Paul was the head and origin of those whom he had planted,
or Apollos the root of those whom he had watered, rather than He who had
given them faith in believing; whereas the same Paul says, "I have
planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase:  so then neither is
he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the
increase." <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927)   Nor was the
apostle himself their root, but rather He who says, "I am the vine, ye
are the branches." <span id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928)   How,
too, could he be their head, when he says, that "we, being many, are one
body in Christ," <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929) and
expressly declares in many passages that Christ Himself is the head of
the whole body?
