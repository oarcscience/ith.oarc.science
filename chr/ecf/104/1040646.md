<span id="v.v.v.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49.—</span>59.  Do not therefore any
longer say, "The conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we
look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient," lest you be asked,
When a stain on the conscience of the giver is concealed, who cleanses
the conscience of the recipient?  And when you shall have answered,
Either God or an angel (since there is no other answer which you
possibly can make), then should follow a consequence whereby you would
be confounded:  Those then are justified with greater holiness who are
baptized by undetected evil men, so as to be cleansed by God or by an
angel, than those who are baptized by men who are genuinely and
manifestly good, who cannot be compared with God or with the angels. 
But prevail upon yourselves to say what is said by Truth and by the
Catholic Church, that not only when the minister of baptism is evil, but
also when he is holy and good, hope is still not to be placed in man,
but in Him that justifieth the ungodly, in whom if any man believe, his
faith is counted for righteousness. <span
id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md)   For when we say, Christ baptizes,
we do not mean by a visible ministry, as Petilianus believes, or would
have men think that he believes, to be our meaning, but by a hidden
grace, by a hidden power in the Holy Spirit as it is said of Him by John
the Baptist, "The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost." <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md)   Nor has He, as Petilianus says,
now ceased to baptize; but He still does it, not by any ministry of the
body, but by the invisible working of His majesty.  For in that we say,
He Himself baptizes, we do not mean, He Himself holds and dips in the
water the bodies of the believers; but He Himself invisibly cleanses,
and that He does to the whole Church without exception.  Nor, indeed,
may we refuse to believe the words of the Apostle Paul who says
concerning Him, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved
the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse
it with the washing of water by the word." <span
id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md)   Here you see that Christ
sanctifies; here you see that Christ also Himself washes, Himself
purifies with the self-same washing of water by the word, wherein the
ministers are seen to do their work in the body.  Let no one, therefore,
claim unto himself what is of God.  The hope of men is only sure when it
is fixed on Him who cannot deceive, since "Cursed be every one that
trusteth in man," <span id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) and
"Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord His trust." <span
id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md)   For the faithful steward shall
receive as his reward eternal life; but the unfaithful steward, when he
dispenses his lord’s provisions to his fellow-servants, must in no wise
be conceived to make the provisions useless by his own unfaithfulness. 
For the Lord says, "Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and
do; but do not ye after their works." <span
id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md)   And this is therefore the
injunction that is given us against evil stewards, that the good things
of God should be received at their hands, but that we should beware of
their own evil life, by reason of its unlikeness to what they thus
dispense.
