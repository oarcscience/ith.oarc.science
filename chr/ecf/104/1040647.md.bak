<span id="v.v.v.l"></span>

<span id="v.v.v.l-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50.—</span>60.  But if it is clear that
Petilianus has made no answer to those first words of my epistle, and
that, when he has endeavored to make an answer, he has shown all the
more clearly how incapable he was of answering, what shall I say in
respect of those portions of my writings which he has not even attempted
to answer, on which he has not touched at all?  And yet if any one shall
be willing to review their character, having in his possession both my
writings and those of Petilianus, I think he will understand by what
confirmation they are supported.  And that I may show you this as
shortly as I can, I would beg you to call to mind the proofs that were
advanced from holy Scripture, or refresh your memory by reading both
what he has brought forward as against me, and what I have brought
forward in my answer as against you, and see how I have shown that the
passages which he has brought forward are antagonistic not to me, but
rather to yourselves; whilst he has altogether failed to touch those
which I brought forward as especially necessary, and in that one passage
of the apostle which he has endeavored to make use of as though it
favored him, you will see how he found himself without the means of
making his escape.

<span id="v.v.v.l-p2"></span>61.  For the portion of this epistle which
he wrote to his adherents—from the beginning down to the passage in
which he says, <span id="page_622">p. 622</span> <span
id="v.v.v.l-Page_622"></span>"This is the commandment of the Lord to us,
‘When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another;’ <span
id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md) and if they persecute you in that
also, flee ye to a third"—came first into my hands, and to it I made a
reply; and when this reply of ours had fallen, in turn, into his hands,
he wrote in answer to it this which I am now refuting, showing that he
has made no reply to mine.  In that first portion, therefore, of his
writings to which I first replied, these are the passages of Scripture
which he conceives to be opposed to us:  "Every good tree bringeth forth
good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  Do men gather
grapes of thorns?" <span id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md)   And
again:  "A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth
forth good things:  and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth
forth evil things." <span id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md)   And
again:  "When a man is baptized by one that is dead, his washing
profiteth him nothing." <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md)  
From these passages he is anxious to show that the man who is baptized
is made to partake of the character of him by whom he is baptized; I on
the other hand, have shown in what sense these passages should be
received, and that they could in no wise aid his view.  But as for the
other expressions which he has used against evil and accursed men, I
have sufficiently shown that they are applicable to the Lord’s wheat,
dispersed, as was foretold and promised, throughout the world, and that
they might rather be used by us against you.  Examine them again, and
you will find it so.

<span id="v.v.v.l-p7"></span>62.  But the passages which I have advanced
to assert the truth of the Catholic Church, are the following:  As
regards the question of baptism, that our being born again, cleansed,
justified by the grace of God, should not be ascribed to the man who
administered the sacrament, I quoted these:  "It is better to trust in
the Lord than to put confidence in man:" <span
id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432.md)   and "Cursed be every one that
trusteth in man;" <span id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433.md) and that,
"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord;" <span
id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md) and that, "Vain is the help of
man;" <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435.md) and that, "Neither is
he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth
the increase;" <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md) and that He in
whom men believe justifieth the ungodly, that his faith may be counted
to him for righteousness. <span id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md)  
But in behalf of the unity of the Church itself, which is spread abroad
throughout all the world, with which you do not hold communion, I urged
that the following passages were prophesied of Christ:  that "He shall
have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of
the earth;" <span id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) and, "I shall
give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
the earth for Thy possession;" <span
id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) and that the covenant of God made
with Abraham may be quoted in behalf of our, that is, of the Catholic
communion, in which it is written, "In thy seed shall all nations of the
earth be blessed;" <span id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) which seed
the apostle interprets, saying, "And to thy seed, which is
Christ." <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md)   Whence it is
evident that in Christ not only Africans or Africa, but all the nations
through which the Catholic Church is spread abroad, should receive the
blessing which was promised so long before.  And that the chaff is to be
with the wheat even to the time of the last winnowing, that no one may
excuse the sacrilege of his own separation from the Church by calumnious
accusations of other men’s offenses, if he shall have left or deserted
the communion of all nations; and to show that the society of Christians
may not be divided on account of evil ministers, that is, evil rulers in
the Church, I further quoted the passage, "All whatsoever they bid you
observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works; for they
say and do not." <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md)   With
regard to these passages of holy Scripture which I advanced to prove my
points, he neither showed how they ought to be otherwise interpreted, so
as to prove that they neither made for us nor against you, nor was he
willing to touch them in any way.  Nay, his whole object was could it
have been achieved, that by the tumultuous outpouring of his abuse, it
might never occur to any one at all, who after reading my epistle might
have been willing to read his as well, that these things had been said
by me.
