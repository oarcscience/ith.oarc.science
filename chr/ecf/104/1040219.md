id="iv.x.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—The Tree Was Forbidden to Adam
Not Because It Was Evil, But Because It Was Good for Man to Be Subject
to God.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxxvii-p2"></span>For besides, He had made the
prohibition, in order to show that the nature of the rational soul ought
not to be in its own power, but in subjection to God, and that it guards
the order of its salvation through obedience, <span id="page_359">p.

disobedience.  Hence also He called the tree, the touching of which He
forbade, the tree "of the knowledge of good and evil;" <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) because when man should have
touched it in the face of the prohibition, he would experience the
penalty of sin, and so would know the difference between the good of
obedience, and the evil of disobedience.
