class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxxv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"O wretched *traditors!*  Thus indeed it was fitting that Scripture
should be fulfilled.  But in you I grieve for this, that you have shown
yourselves worthy to fulfill the part of wickedness."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxv-p2"></span>166.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxv-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I might rather
say, O wretched *traditors!* if I were minded, or rather if justice
urged me to cast up against all of you the deeds of some among your
number.  But as regards what bears on all of you, O wretched heretics, I
on my part will quote the remainder of your words; for it is written,
"There must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may
be made manifest among you."  <span id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178)
  Therefore "it was fitting thus that Scripture should be fulfilled. 
But in you I grieve for this, that you have shown yourselves worthy to
fulfill the part of wickedness."
