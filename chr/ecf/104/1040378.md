<span id="v.iv.viii.xxiv"></span>

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—</span>42.  Fortunatus of
Thuccabori <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md) said:  "Jesus
Christ our Lord and God, the Son of God the Father and Creator, built
His Church upon a rock, not upon heresy, <span id="page_490">p.
490</span> <span id="v.iv.viii.xxiv-Page_490"></span>and gave the power
of baptizing to bishops, not to heretics.  Wherefore those who are
outside the Church, and stand against Christ, scattering His sheep and
flock, cannot baptize outside." <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxiv-p4"></span>43.  He added the word "outside" in
order that he might not be answered with a like brevity to Successus. 
For otherwise he might also have been answered word for word:  Jesus
Christ our Lord and God, the Son of God the Father and Creator, built
His Church upon a rock, not upon iniquity, and gave the power of
baptizing to bishops, not to the unrighteous.  Wherefore those who do
not belong to the rock on which they build, who hear the word of God and
do it,  <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) but, living contrary
to Christ in hearing the word and not doing it, and hereby building on
the sand, in this way scatter His sheep and flock by the example of an
abandoned character, cannot baptize.  Might not this be said with all
the semblance of truth? and yet it is false.  For the unrighteous do
baptize, since those robbers are unrighteous whom Cyprian maintained to
be at unity with himself. <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md)  
But for this reason, says the Donatist, he adds "outside."  Why
therefore can they not baptize outside?  Is it because they are worse
from the very fact that they are outside?  But it makes no difference,
in respect of the validity of baptism, how much worse the minister may
be.  For there is not so much difference between bad and worse as
between good and bad; and yet, when the bad baptizes, he gives the
selfsame sacrament as the good.  Therefore, also, when the worse
baptizes, he gives the selfsame sacrament as the less bad.  Or is it
that it is not in respect of man’s merit, but of the sacrament of
baptism itself, that it cannot be given outside?  If this were so,
neither could it be possessed outside, and it would be necessary that a
man should be baptized again so often as he left the Church and again
returned to it.

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxiv-p7"></span>44.  Further, if we inquire more
carefully what is meant by "outside," especially as he himself makes
mention of the rock on which the Church is built, are not they in the
Church who are on the rock, and they who are not on the rock, not in the
Church either?  Now, therefore, let us see whether they build their
house upon a rock who hear the words of Christ and do them not.  The
Lord Himself declares the contrary, saying, "Whosoever heareth these
sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which
built his house upon a rock;" and a little later, "Every one that
heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto
a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand." <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md)   If, therefore, the Church is on a
rock, those who are on the sand, because they are outside the rock, are
necessarily outside the Church.  Let us recollect, therefore, how many
Cyprian mentions as placed within who build upon the sand, that is, who
hear the words of Christ and do them not.  And therefore, because they
are on the sand, they are proved to be outside the rock, that is,
outside the Church; yet even while they are so situated, and are either
not yet or never changed for the better, not only do they baptize and
are baptized, but the baptism which they have remains valid in them
though they are destined to damnation.

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxiv-p9"></span>45.  Neither can it be said in this
place, <span id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) Yet who is there that
doeth all the words of the Lord which are written in the evangelic
sermon itself, <span id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) at the end of
which He says, that he who heard the said words and did them built upon
a rock, and he who heard them and did them not built upon the sand? 
For, granting that by certain persons all the words are not
accomplished, yet in the same sermon He has appointed the remedy,
saying, "Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven." <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md)   And after the Lord’s prayer had
been recorded in detail in the same sermon, He says, "For I say unto
you, if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
forgive you:  but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
your Father forgive your trespasses." <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md)   Hence also Peter says, "For
charity shall cover the multitude of sins;" <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) which charity they certainly did
not have, and on this account they built upon the sand, of whom the same
Cyprian says, that within the Church they held conversation, even in the
time of the apostles, in unkindly hatred alien from Christian
charity; <span id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) and therefore they
seemed indeed to be within, but really were without, because they were
not on that rock by which the Church is signified.
