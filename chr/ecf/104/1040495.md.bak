<span id="v.v.iv.viii"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—</span>17.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.viii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"We must consider, I say, and declare how far the treacherous *traditor*
is to be accounted dead while yet in life.  Judas was an apostle when he
betrayed Christ; and the same man was already dead, having spiritually
lost the office of an apostle, being destined afterwards to die by
hanging himself, as it is written:  ‘I have sinned,’ says he, ‘in that I
have betrayed the innocent blood; and he departed, and went and hanged
himself.’ <span id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md)   The traitor
perished by the rope:  he left the rope for others like himself, of whom
the Lord Christ cried aloud to the Father, ‘Father, those that Thou
gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of
perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled.’ <span
id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md)   For David of old <span
id="page_533">p. 533</span> <span id="v.v.iv.viii-Page_533"></span>had
passed this sentence on him who was to betray Christ to the
unbelievers:  ‘Let another take his office.  Let his children be
fatherless, and his wife a widow.’ <span
id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984.md)   See how mighty is the spirit of
the prophets, that it was able to see all future things as though they
were present, so that a traitor who was to be born hereafter should be
condemned many centuries before.  Finally, that the said sentence should
be completed, the holy Matthias received the bishopric of that lost
apostle.  Let no one be so dull, no one so faithless, as to dispute
this:  Matthias won for himself a victory, not a wrong, in that he
carried off the spoils of the traitor from the victory of the Lord
Christ.  Why then, after this, do you claim to yourself a bishopric as
the heir of a worse traitor?  Judas betrayed Christ in the flesh to the
unbelievers; you in the spirit madly betrayed the holy gospel to the
flames of sacrilege.  Judas betrayed the Lawgiver to the unbelievers;
you, as it were, betraying all that he had left, gave up the law of God
to be destroyed by men.  Whilst, had you loved the law, like the
youthful Maccabees, you would have welcomed death for the sake of the
laws of God (if indeed that can be said to be death to men which makes
them immortal because they died for the Lord); for of those brethren we
learn that one replied to the sacrilegious tyrant with these words of
faith:  ‘Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life; but the
King of the world (who reigns for ever, and of His kingdom there shall
be no end) shall raise us up who have died for His laws, unto
everlasting life.’  <span id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985.md)   If you
were to burn with fire the testament of a dead man, would you not be
punished as the falsifier of a will?  What therefore is likely to become
of you who have burned the most holy law of our God and Judge?  Judas
repented of his deed even in death; you not only do not repent, but
stand forth as a persecutor and butcher of us who keep the law, whilst
you are the most wicked of *traditors*."

<span id="v.v.iv.viii-p6"></span>18.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.viii-p6.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  See what a
difference there is between your calumnious words and our truthful
assertions.  Listen for a little while.  See how you have exaggerated
the sin of delivering up the sacred books, comparing us in most odious
terms, like some sophistical inventor of charges, with the traitor
Judas.  But when I shall have answered you on this point with the utmost
brevity,—I did not do what you assert; I did not deliver up the sacred
books; your charge is false; you will never be able to prove it,—will
not all that smoke of mighty words presently vanish away?  Or will you
perchance endeavor to prove the truth of what you say?  This, then, you
should do first; and then you might rise against us, as against men who
were already convicted, with whatever mass of invective you might
choose.  Here is one absurdity:  behold again a second.

<span id="v.v.iv.viii-p7"></span>19.  You yourself, when speaking of the
foretelling of the condemnation of Judas, used these expressions:  "See
how mighty is the spirit of the prophets, that it was able to see all
future things as though they were present, so that a traitor who was to
be born hereafter should be condemned many centuries before;" and yet
you did not see that in the same sure prophecy, and certain and unshaken
truth, in which it was foretold that one of the disciples should
hereafter betray the Christ; it was also foretold that the whole world
should hereafter believe in Christ.  Why did you pay attention in the
prophecy to the man who betrayed Christ, and in the same place give no
heed to the world for which Christ was betrayed?  Who betrayed Christ? 
Judas.  To whom did he betray Him?  To the Jews.  What did the Jews do
to Him?  "They pierced my hands and my feet," says the Psalmist.  "I may
tell all my bones:  they look and stare upon me.  They part my garments
among them, and cast lots upon my vesture." <span
id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986.md)   Of what importance, then, that is
which is bought at such a price, I would have you read a little later in
the psalm itself:  "All the ends of the world shall remember and turn
unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
Thee.  For the kingdom is the Lord’s; and He is the governor among the
nations." <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987.md)   But who is able
to suffice for the quotation of all the other innumerable prophetic
passages which bear witness to the world that is destined to believe? 
Yet you quote a prophecy because you see in it the man who sold Christ: 
you do not see in it the possession which Christ bought by being sold. 
Here is the second absurdity:  behold again the third.

<span id="v.v.iv.viii-p10"></span>20.  Among the many other expressions
in your invective, you said:  "If you were to burn with fire the
testament of a dead man, would you not be punished as the falsifier of a
will?  What therefore is likely to become of you who have burned the
most holy law of our God and Judge?"  In these words you have paid no
attention to what certainly ought to have moved you, to the question of
how it might be that we should burn the testament, and yet stand fast in
the inheritance <span id="page_534">p. 534</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.viii-Page_534"></span>which was described in that testament;
but it is marvellous that you have preserved the testament and lost the
inheritance.  Is it not written in that testament, "Ask of me, and I
shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost
parts of the earth for thy possession"? <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md)   Take part in this inheritance,
and you may bring what charges you will against me about the testament. 
For what madness is it, that while you shrank from committing the
testament to the flames, you should yet strive against the words of the
testator!  We, on the other hand, though we hold in our hands the
records of the Church and of the State, in which we read that those who
ordained a rival bishop <span id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) in
opposition to Cæcilianus were rather the betrayers of the sacred books,
yet do not on this account insult you, or pursue you with invectives, or
mourn over the ashes of the sacred pages in your hands, or contrast the
burning torments of the Maccabees with the sacrilege of your fear,
saying, "You should deliver your own limbs to the flames rather than the
utterances of God."  For we are unwilling to be so absurd as to excite
an empty uproar against you on account of the deeds of others, which you
either know nothing of, or else repudiate.  But in that we see you
separated from the communion of the whole world (a sin both of the
greatest magnitude, and manifest to all mankind, and common to you all),
if I were desirous of exaggerating, I should find time failing me sooner
than words.  And if you should seek to defend yourself on this charge,
it could only be by bringing accusations against the whole world, of
such a kind that, if they could be maintained, you would simply be
furnishing matter for further accusation against yourself; if they could
not be maintained, there is in them no defence for you.  Why therefore
do you puff yourself up against me about the betrayal of the sacred
books, which concerns neither you nor me if we abide by the agreement
not to charge each other with the sins of other men:  and which, if that
agreement does not stand, affects you rather than me?  And, yet, even
without any violation of that agreement, I think I may say with perfect
justice that he should be deemed a partner with him who delivered up
Christ who has not delivered himself up to Christ in company with the
whole world.  "Then," says the apostle, "then are ye Abraham’s seed, and
heirs according to the promise." <span
id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md)   And again he says, "Heirs of God,
and joint-heirs with Christ." <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md)
  And the same apostle shows that the seed of Abraham belongs to all
nations from the promise which was given to Abraham, "In thy seed shall
all the nations of the earth be blessed." <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992.md)   Wherefore I consider that I am
only making a fair demand in asking that we should for a moment consider
the testament of God, which has already long been opened, and that we
should consider every one to be himself an heir of the traitor whom we
do not find to be a joint-heir with Him whom he betrayed; that every one
should belong to him who sold Christ who denies that Christ has bought
the whole world.  For when He showed Himself after His resurrection to
His disciples, and gave His limbs to those who doubted, that they should
handle them, He says this to them, "For thus it is written, and thus it
behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the third
day:  and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." <span
id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md)   See from what an inheritance you
estrange yourselves! see what an Heir you resist!  Can it really be that
a man would spare Christ if He were walking here on earth who speaks
against Him while He sits in heaven?  Do you not yet understand that
whatever you allege against us you allege against His words?  A
Christian world is promised and believed in:  the promise is fulfilled,
and it is denied.  Consider, I entreat of you, what you ought to suffer
for such impiety.  And yet, if I know not what you have suffered,—if I
have not seen it, have not wrought it,—then do you to-day, who do not
suffer the violence of my persecution, render to me an account of your
separation.  But you are likely to say over and over again what, unless
you prove it, can affect no one, and if you prove it, has no bearing
upon me.
