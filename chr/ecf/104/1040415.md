<span id="v.iv.ix.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—</span>30.  Another Saturninus
of Tucca <span id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) said:  "The
Gentiles, although they worship idols, yet acknowledge and confess the
supreme God, the Father and Creator.  Against Him Marcion blasphemes,
and some men do not blush to approve the baptism of Marcion. <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md)   How do such priests either
maintain or vindicate the priesthood of God, who do not baptize the
enemies of God, and hold communion with them while they are thus
unbaptized?" <span id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xvi-p5"></span>31.  The answer is this:  Truly when
such terms as this are used, all moderation is passed; nor do they take
into consideration that even they themselves hold communion with such
men, "judging no one, nor removing any from the right of communion if he
entertain a contrary opinion."  But Saturninus has used an argument in
this very judgment of his, which might furnish materials for his
admonition (if he would pay attention to it), that in each man what is
wrong should be corrected, and what is right should be approved, since
he says, "The Gentiles, although they worship idols, yet acknowledge and
confess the supreme God, the Father and Creator."  If, then, any Gentile
of such a kind should come to God, would he wish to correct and change
this point in him, that he acknowledged and confessed God the Father and
Creator?  I trow not.  But he would amend in him his idolatry, which was
an evil in him; and he would give to him the sacraments of Christ, which
he did not possess; and anything that was wayward which he found in him
he would correct; and anything which had been wanting he would supply. 
So also in the Marcionist heretic he would acknowledge the perfectness
of baptism, he would correct his waywardness, he would teach him
Catholic truth.

Rome, of whom Cyprian says in his Ep. lxxiv. 7<span
id="v.iv.ix.xvi-p3.1"></span> (to Pompeius):  "Why has the perverse
obstinacy of our brother Stephen burst out to such a point, that he
should even contend that sons of God are born of the baptism of Marcion,
also of Valentinus and Apelles, and others who blaspheme against God the
Father?"
