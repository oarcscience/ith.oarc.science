<span id="iv.viii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.viii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—The Holy Spirit Twice
Given.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p2"></span>11.  For the glorification of our Lord
among men is His resurrection from the dead and His ascension to
heaven.  For it is written in the Gospel according to John:  "The Holy
Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet
glorified." <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md)   Now if the reason
why He was not given was that Jesus was not yet glorified, He was given
immediately on the glorification of Jesus.  And since that glorification
was twofold, as regards man and as regards God, twice also was the Holy
Spirit given:  once, when, after His resurrection from the dead, He
breathed on the face of His disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy
Ghost;" <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) and again, ten days
after His ascension to heaven.  This number ten signifies perfection;
for to the number seven which embraces all created things, is added the
trinity of the Creator. <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md)   On
these things there is much pious and sober discourse among spiritual
men.  But I must keep to my point; for my business at present is not to
teach you, which you might think presumptuous, but to take the part of
an inquirer, and learn from you, as I tried to do for nine years without
success.  Now, therefore, I have a document to believe on the subject of
the Holy Spirit’s advent; and if you bid me not to believe this
document, as your usual advice is not to believe ignorantly, without
consideration, <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) much less will I
believe your documents.  Away, then, with all books, and disclose the
truth with logical clearness, so as to leave no doubt in my mind; or
bring forward books where I shall find not an imperious demand for my
belief, but a trustworthy statement of what I may learn.  Perhaps you
say this epistle is also of this character.  Let me, then, no longer
stop at the threshold:  let us see the contents.

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p6"></span> \[The Manichæans assumed the role of
rationalists, and scorned the credulity of ordinary believers.  Yet they
required in their followers an amount of credulity which only persons of
a peculiar turn of mind could furnish.  The same thing applies to modern
rationalistic anti-Christian systems.  The fact is, that it requires
infinitely less credulity to believe in historical Christianity than to
disbelieve in it.—A.H.N.\]
