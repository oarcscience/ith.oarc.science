id="iv.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—The Christian Definition of the
Four Virtues.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xvii-p2"></span>25.  As to virtue leading us to a happy
life, I hold virtue to be nothing else than perfect love of God.  For
the fourfold division of virtue I regard as taken from four forms of
love.  For these four virtues (would that all felt their influence in
their minds as they have their names in their mouths!), I should have no
hesitation in defining them:  that temperance is love giving itself
entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all
things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only
the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love
distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it. 
The object of this love is not anything, but only God, the chief good,
the highest wisdom, the perfect harmony.  So we may express the
definition thus:  that temperance is love keeping itself entire and
incorrupt for God; fortitude is love bearing everything readily for the
sake of God; justice is love serving God only, and therefore ruling well
all else, as subject to man; prudence is love making a right distinction
between what helps it towards God and what might hinder it. <span

Christian literature a more beautiful and satisfactory exposition of
love to God.  The Neo-Platonic influence is manifest, but it is
Neo-Platonism thoroughly Christianized.—A.H.N.\]
