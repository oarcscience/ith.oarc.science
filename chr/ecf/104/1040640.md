<span id="v.v.v.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—</span>52.  These things, I
think, I put with clearness and truth in my former epistle, when I made
answer to Petilianus.  These things I have also now quoted, intimating
and commending to you the truth that our faith rests on something else
altogether than man, and that we believe that the Lord Christ is the
cleanser and the justifier of men that believe in Him that justifieth
the ungodly, that their faith may be counted unto them for
righteousness, whether the man who administers the baptism be righteous,
or such an impious and deceitful man as the Holy Spirit flees.  Then I
went on to point out what absurdity would follow were it otherwise, and
I said, as I say now:  "Otherwise, if each man is born again in
spiritual grace of the <span id="page_618">p. 618</span> <span
id="v.v.v.xliii-Page_618"></span>same sort as he by whom he is baptized,
and if, when he who baptizes him is manifestly a good man, then he
himself gives faith, he is himself the origin and root and head of him
who is being born; whilst, when the baptizer is faithless without its
being known, then the baptized person receives faith from Christ, then
derives his origin from Christ, then he is rooted in Christ then he
boasts in Christ as his head; in that case all who are baptized should
wish that they might have faithless baptizers, and be ignorant of their
faithlessness.  For however good their baptizers might have been, Christ
is certainly beyond comparison better still, and He will then be the
Head of the baptized if the faithlessness of the baptizer shall escape
detection.  But if it be perfect madness to hold such a view (for it is
Christ always that justifieth the ungodly, by changing his ungodliness
into Christianity; it is from Christ always that faith is received;
Christ is always the origin of the regenerate, and the Head of the
Church), what weight then will those words have, which thoughtless
readers value by their sound, without inquiring what their inner meaning
is?"  <span id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412.md)   This much I said at
that time; this is written in my epistle.
