<p class="c41"><a name="v.v.v.xlix-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.v.xlix-p1.1"></A>Chapter 49.&#8212;</span>59.&#160; Do not therefore any longer say, "The conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient," lest you be asked, When a stain on the conscience of the giver is concealed, who cleanses the conscience of the recipient?&#160; And when you shall have answered, Either God or an angel (since there is no other answer which you possibly can make), then should follow a consequence   whereby you would be confounded:&#160; Those then are justified with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected evil men, so as to be cleansed by God or by an angel, than those who are baptized by men who are genuinely and manifestly good, who cannot be compared with God or with the angels.&#160; But prevail upon yourselves to say what is said by Truth and by the Catholic Church, that not only when the minister of baptism is evil, but also when he is holy and good, hope is still not to be placed in   man, but in Him that justifieth the ungodly, in whom if any man believe, his faith is counted for righteousness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2422"></A><A HREF="#fn_2422"><FONT SIZE="1">2423</FONT></A>
&#160; For when we say, Christ baptizes, we do not mean by a visible ministry, as Petilianus believes, or would have men think that he believes, to be our meaning, but by a hidden grace, by a hidden power in the Holy Spirit as it is said of Him by John the Baptist, "The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2423"></A><A HREF="#fn_2423"><FONT SIZE="1">2424</FONT></A>
&#160; Nor has He, as Petilianus says, now ceased to baptize; but He still does it, not by any ministry of the body, but by the invisible working of His majesty.&#160; For in that we say, He Himself baptizes, we do not mean, He Himself holds and dips in the water the bodies of the believers; but He Himself invisibly cleanses, and that He does to the whole Church without exception.&#160; Nor, indeed, may we refuse to believe the words of the Apostle Paul who says concerning Him, "Husbands,   love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2424"></A><A HREF="#fn_2424"><FONT SIZE="1">2425</FONT></A>
&#160; Here you see that Christ sanctifies; here you see that Christ also Himself washes, Himself purifies with the self-same washing of water by the word, wherein the ministers are seen to do their work in the body.&#160; Let no one, therefore, claim unto himself what is of God.&#160; The hope of men is only sure when it is fixed on Him who cannot deceive, since "Cursed be every one that trusteth in man,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2425"></A><A HREF="#fn_2425"><FONT SIZE="1">2426</FONT></A>
 and "Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord His trust."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2426"></A><A HREF="#fn_2426"><FONT SIZE="1">2427</FONT></A>
&#160; For the faithful steward shall receive as his reward eternal life; but the unfaithful steward, when he dispenses his lord&#146;s provisions to his fellow-servants, must in no wise be conceived to make the provisions useless by his own unfaithfulness.&#160; For the Lord says, "Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2427"></A><A HREF="#fn_2427"><FONT SIZE="1">2428</FONT></A>
&#160; And this is therefore the injunction that is given us against evil stewards, that the good things of God should be received at their hands, but that we should beware of their own evil life, by reason of its unlikeness to what they thus dispense.</p>
