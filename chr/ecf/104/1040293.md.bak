<span id="v.iv.v.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—</span>20.  Accordingly, if
Marcion consecrated the sacrament of baptism with the words of the
gospel, "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost," <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) the sacrament was
complete, although his faith expressed under the same words, seeing that
he held opinions not taught by the Catholic truth, was not complete, but
stained with the falsity of fables. <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md)   For under these same words, "In
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," not
Marcion only, or Valentinus, or Arius, or Eunomius, but the carnal babes
of the Church themselves (to whom the apostle said, "I could not speak
unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal"), if they could be
individually asked for an accurate exposition of their opinions, would
probably show a diversity of opinions as numerous as the persons who
held them, "for the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God."  Can it, however, be said on this account that they do not
receive the complete sacrament? or that, if they shall advance, and
correct the vanity of their carnal opinions, they must seek again what
they had received?  Each man receives after the fashion of his own
faith; yet how much does he obtain under the guidance of that mercy of
God, in the confident assurance of which the same apostle says, "If in
anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
you"? <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md)   Yet the snares of
heretics and schismatics prove for this reason only too pernicious to
the carnally-minded, because their very progress is intercepted when
their vain opinions are confirmed in opposition to the Catholic truth,
and the perversity of their dissension is strengthened against the
Catholic peace.  Yet if the sacraments are the same, they are everywhere
complete, even when they are wrongly understood, and perverted to be
instruments of discord, just as the very writings of the gospel, if they
are only the same, are everywhere complete, even though quoted with a
boundless variety of false opinions.  For as to what Jeremiah says:—"Why
do those who grieve me prevail against me?  My wound is stubborn, whence
shall I be healed?  In its origin it became unto me as lying water,
having no certainty," <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) —if the
term "water" were never used figuratively and in the allegorical
language of prophecy except to signify baptism, we should have trouble
in discovering what these words of Jeremiah meant; but as it is, when
"waters" are expressly used in the Apocalypse <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md) to signify "peoples," I do not see
why, by "lying water having no certainty," I should not understand, a
"lying people, whom I cannot trust."
