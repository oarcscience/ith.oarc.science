<span id="iv.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="iv.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.— The Relation of Manichæism to
Buddhism.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.vi-p2"></span>The extent of Mani’s dependence on
Buddhism is a matter that has been much disputed.  The attention of
scholars was first directed to this possible source of Manichæism by the
discovery of important features that are radically opposed to
Zoroastrianism, Judaism and Christianity, and by the traditional
historical connection of Mani with India and Turkestan.  The antagonism
of spirit and matter, of light and darkness, the mixture of spirit and
light with matter and darkness in the formation of the world, the final
catastrophe in which complete simplicity shall be re-established, only
inert matter and darkness remaining to represent the Kingdom of
Darkness, abstinence from bloody sacrifices, from marriage, from killing
or eating animals—points in which Manichæism differs widely from the
other systems with which it stands historically related—find their
counterpart in Buddhism.  It is certain, moreover, that they were fully
developed in Buddhism centuries before the time of Mani.  Baur, <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) though not the first to suggest a
connection of the two systems, was the first to show by a somewhat
detailed comparison the close parallelism that exists between Manichæism
and Buddhism.  Baur’s reasonings were still further elaborated and
confirmed by Neander. <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)   External
grounds in favor of Mani’s dependence on Buddhism are the traditions of
Mani’s journey to India and China, and of his prolonged stay in
Turkestan, where Buddhism flourished at that time.  But it is on
internal grounds that we chiefly rely.

<span id="iv.ii.vi-p5"></span>If space permitted we could illustrate the
close parallelism that undoubtedly exists between Manichæism and
Buddhism, from Buddhist documents which have been made accessible
through Professor Max Müller and his collaborators in *The Sacred Book
of the East*, far more completely than was possible to Baur and
Neander.  It is certain that parallels can be found in Buddhism for
almost every feature of Manichæism that is sharply antagonistic to
Zoroastrianism.  The Buddhist view of matter as antagonistic to spirit
is fundamental.  It is the world of matter that deludes.  It is the body
and its passions that prevent the longed-for *Nirvana*.  Buddhist
asceticism is the direct outgrowth of the doctrine of the evil and
delusive nature of matter.  The Buddhist doctrine of metempsychosis has
its precise counterpart in Manichæism, but it should be said that this
doctrine was widely diffused in the West, through Pythagoreanism, before
the time of Mani.  The Buddhist tenderness for animal and plant life is
paralleled by the Manichæan.  But there is <span id="page_23">p.
23</span> <span id="iv.ii.vi-Page_23"></span>considerable difference
between the views on which this tenderness is based.  The Buddhist
feeling was based, in part at least, upon the doctrine of
metempsychosis, animals and plants being regarded as the abodes of human
spirits awaiting their release into *Nirvana*.  The Manichæan looked
upon the elements of light (life) contained in animals and plants as
particles of God, and any injury done to them as a hindrance to the
escape of these elements, to be conveyed away into the Kingdom of
Light.  Both looked upon sexual intercourse as among the greatest of
evils, though the theory in the two cases was slightly different.  So of
the drinking of wine, the eating of animal food, etc.  The final state
was conceived of in substantially the same way in the two systems. 
*Nirvana*, the blowing out of man’s life as an individual entity, is
quite paralleled by the Manichæan view of the gradual escape of the
imprisoned particles of light into the Kingdom of Light.  In both cases
the divine *pleroma* is to be restored in such a way as to destroy
individual consciousness.

<span id="iv.ii.vi-p6"></span>The Buddhist *Bhikkhus* (or ascetical
monks) correspond very closely with the Manichæan Truthful Ones (Elect),
and the relations of these to ordinary adherents of the parties was much
the same in the two cases.  Both systems (like Christianity) had the
proselyting spirit fully developed.  The position of Mani as a preacher
or prophet corresponds with the Buddhist idea of the manifestations of
Buddha.  The statement is attributed to Mani that "as Buddha came in the
land of India, Zoroaster in the land of Persia, and Jesus in the land of
the West, so at last in the epoch of the present this preaching came
through me \[Mani\] in the land of Babylonia."  In the interest of his
theory, which makes the old Babylonian religion the chief source of
Manichæism, Kessler has attempted to detract from the significance of
the Buddhist influence.  Yet he grants that the morality of the
Manichæans (including many of the features mentioned above) was
Buddhist.  The close connection of the two systems cannot, it would
seem, be successfully gainsaid. <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md)

in the History of Christian Thought* (1886), has these remarks on the
relation of Mani to Buddhism:  "Mani was indeed a religious reformer: 
deeply impregnated with the belief and practice which Buddhist monks
were spreading in the East, he tried with some success to reform the
religion of Zoroaster in Persia \[*i.e.* the Persian Empire\], his
native land.  While his fundamental doctrine, the root of his system,
was of Persian origin, and he figured the universe to himself as if it
were given over to the unending conflict between the Powers of Light and
Darkness, in regard to discipline his system very closely resembles that
founded by Buddha; the *elect* of the Manichæans correspond to the
Buddhist *monks*:  the precepts about abstinence from meat and things of
sense are, if not borrowed from the rules Gotama gave for the conduct of
his followers, the outcome of the same principles about the nature of
man."  <span class="c11"><span id="iv.ii.vi-p7.2"></span>Harnack</span>,
art. Manichæism in *Ency. Britannica*, follows Kessler in attaching
slight importance to the Buddhist influence on Manichæism, preferring,
with him, to derive nearly all of the features ascribed by Baur, Neander
and others to Buddhist influence, to the old Babylonian religion, the
precise character of which, in the time of Mani, is imperfectly
understood.  Harnack’s (and Kessler’s) statements must therefore be
taken with some allowance.  There is no objection, however, to supposing
that Mani derived from the old Babylonian party or parties with which he
came in contact religious principles which were wrought out in detail
under the influence of Buddhism.  This is in fact what probably
occurred.
