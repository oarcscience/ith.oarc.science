id="iv.x.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Punishment is Constituted for the
Sinning Nature that It May Be Rightly Ordered.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xi-p2"></span>What sort of punishment, and how great, is
due to each fault, belongs to Divine judgment, not to human; which
punishment assuredly when it is remitted in the case of the converted,
there is great goodness on the part of God, and when it is deservedly
inflicted, there is no injustice on the part of God; because nature is
better ordered by justly smarting under punishment than by rejoicing
with impunity in sin; which nature nevertheless, even thus having some
measure, form, and order, in whatever extremity there is as yet some
good, which things, if they were absolutely taken away, and utterly
consumed, there will be accordingly no good, because no nature will
remain.
