<span id="v.v.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—</span>34.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"David also spoke of you as persecutors in the following terms:  ‘Their
throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues have they deceived; the
poison of asps is under their lips.  Their mouth is full of cursing and
bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood.  Destruction and
unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not known: 
there is no fear of God before their eyes.  Have all the workers of
wickedness no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread?’" <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011)

<span id="v.v.iv.xv-p3"></span>35.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xv-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Their throat is an
open sepulchre, whence they breathe out death by lies.  For "the mouth
that belieth slayeth the soul." <span
id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012)   But if nothing is more true than
that which Christ said, that His Church should be throughout all
nations, beginning at Jerusalem, then there is nothing more false than
that which you say, that it is in the party of Donatus.  But the tongues
<span id="page_538">p. 538</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.xv-Page_538"></span>which have deceived are the tongues of
those who, whilst they are acquainted with their own deeds, not only say
that they are just men, but that they are justifiers of men, which is
said of One only "that justifieth the ungodly," <span
id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013) and that because "He is just and
the justifier." <span id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014)   As regards
the poison of asps, and the mouth full of cursing and bitterness, we
have said enough already.  But you have yourselves said that the
followers of Maximianus had feet swift to shed blood, as is testified by
the sentence of your plenary Council, so often quoted in the records of
the proconsular province and of the state.  But they, so far as we hear,
never killed any one in the body.  You evidently, therefore, understood
that the blood of the soul was shed in spiritual murder by the sword of
schism, which you condemned in Maximianus.  See then if your feet are
not swift to shed blood, when you cut off men from the unity of the
whole world, if you were right in saying it of the followers of
Maximianus, because they cut off some from the party of Donatus.  Are we
again without the knowledge of the way of peace, who study to preserve
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace? and yet do you possess
that knowledge, who resist the discourse which Christ held with His
disciples after His resurrection, of so peaceful a nature that He began
it with the greeting, "Peace be unto you;" <span
id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015) and that so strenuously that you
are proved to be saying nothing less to Him than this, "What Thou saidst
of the unity of all nations is false; what we say of the offense of all
nations is true"?  Who would say such things as this if they had the
fear of God before their eyes?  See, therefore, if in daily saying
things like this you are not trying to destroy the people of God
dispersed throughout the world, eating them up as it were bread.
