id="iv.viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—The Memory Contains the Ideas
of Places of the Greatest Size.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xviii-p2"></span>Again, if we consider the mind’s
power of remembering not the objects of the intellect, but material
objects, such as we see brutes also remembering (for cattle find their
way without mistake in familiar places, and animals return to their
cribs, and dogs recognize the persons of their masters, and when asleep
they often growl, or break out into a bark, which could not be unless
their mind retained the images of things before seen or perceived by
some bodily sense), who can conceive rightly where these images are
contained, where they are kept, or where they are formed?  If, indeed,
these images were no larger than the size of our body, it might be said
that the mind shapes and retains them in the bodily space which contains
itself.  But while the body occupies a small material space, the mind
revolves images of vast extent, of heaven and earth, with no want of
room, though they come and go in crowds; so that clearly, the mind is
not diffused through space:  for instead of being contained in images of
the largest spaces, it rather contains them; not, however, in any
material receptacle, but by a mysterious faculty or power, by which it
can increase or diminish them, can contract them within narrow limits,
or expand them indefinitely, can arrange or disarrange them at pleasure,
can multiply them or reduce them to a few or to one.
