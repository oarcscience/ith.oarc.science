id="iv.viii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—Corruption is by God’s
Permission, and Comes from Us.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xlii-p2"></span>47.  You ask, Why does corruption take
from nature what God has given to it?  It takes nothing but where God
permits; and He permits in righteous and well-ordered judgment,
according to the degrees of non-intelligent and the deserts of
intelligent creatures.  The word uttered passes away as an object of
sense, and perishes in silence; and yet the coming and going of these
passing words make our speech, and the regular intervals of silence give
pleasing and appropriate distinction; and so it is with temporal natures
which have this lowest form of beauty, that transition gives them being,
and the death of what they give birth to gives them individuality.  And
if our sense and memory could rightly take in the order and proportions
of this beauty, it would so please us, that we should not dare to give
the name of corruptions to those imperfections which give rise to the
distinction.  And when distress comes to us through their peculiar
beauty, by the loss of beloved temporal things passing away, we both pay
the penalty of our sins, and are exhorted to set our affection on
eternal things.
