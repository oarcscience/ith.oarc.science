id="iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Virtue Gives Perfection to the
Soul; The Soul Obtains Virtue by Following God; Following God is the
Happy Life.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>9.  No one will question that virtue
gives perfection to the soul.  But it is a very proper subject of
inquiry whether this virtue can exist by itself or only in the soul. 
Here again arises a profound discussion, needing lengthy treatment; but
perhaps my summary will serve the purpose.  God will, I trust, assist
me, so that, notwithstanding our feebleness, we may give instruction on
these great matters briefly as well as intelligibly.  In either case,
whether virtue can exist by itself without the soul, or can exist only
in the soul, undoubtedly in the pursuit of virtue the soul follows after
something, and this must be <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="iv.iv.viii-Page_44"></span>either the soul itself, or virtue, or
something else.  But if the soul follows after itself in the pursuit of
virtue, it follows after a foolish thing; for before obtaining virtue it
is foolish.  Now the height of a follower’s desire is to reach that
which he follows after.  So the soul must either not wish to reach what
it follows after, which is utterly absurd and unreasonable, or, in
following after itself while foolish, it reaches the folly which it
flees from.  But if it follows after virtue in the desire to reach it,
how can it follow what does not exist? or how can it desire to reach
what it already possesses?  Either, therefore, virtue exists beyond the
soul, or if we are not allowed to give the name of virtue except to the
habit and disposition of the wise soul, which can exist only in the
soul, we must allow that the soul follows after something else in order
that virtue may be produced in itself; for neither by following after
nothing, nor by following after folly, can the soul, according to my
reasoning, attain to wisdom.

<span id="iv.iv.viii-p3"></span>10.  This something else then, by
following after which the soul becomes possessed of virtue and wisdom,
is either a wise man or God.  But we have said already that it must be
something that we cannot lose against our will.  No one can think it
necessary to ask whether a wise man, supposing we are content to follow
after him, can be taken from us in spite of our unwillingness or our
persistence.  God then remains, in following after whom we live well,
and in reaching whom we live both well and happily.  If any deny God’s
existence, why should I consider the method of dealing with them, when
it is doubtful whether they ought to be dealt with at all?  At any rate,
it would require a different starting-point, a different plan, a
different investigation from what we are now engaged in.  I am now
addressing those who do not deny the existence of God, and who,
moreover, allow that human affairs are not disregarded by Him.  For
there is no one, I suppose, who makes any profession of religion but
will hold that divine Providence cares at least for our souls.
