<span id="v.iv.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18—</span>23.  "As my Father hath
sent me," says our Lord, "even so send I you.  And what He had said
this, He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy
Ghost.  Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained." <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308)   Therefore, if they represented
the Church, and this was said to them as to the Church herself, it
follows that the peace of the Church looses sins, and estrangement from
the Church retains them, not according to the will of men, but according
to the will of God and the prayers of the saints who are spiritual, who
"judge all things, but themselves are judged of no man." <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309)   For the rock retains, the rock
remits; the dove retains, the dove remits; unity retains, unity remits. 
But the peace of this unity exists only in the good, in those who are
either already spiritual, or are advancing by the obedience of concord
to spiritual things; it exists not in the bad, whether they make
disturbances abroad, or are endured within the Church with lamenta<span
id="page_444">p. 444</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xviii-Page_444"></span>tions, baptizing and being baptized. 
But just as those who are tolerated with groanings within the Church,
although they do not belong to the same unity of the dove, and to that
"glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing," <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310) yet if they are corrected, and
confess that they approached to baptism most unworthily, are not
baptized again, but begin to belong to the dove, through whose groans
those sins are remitted which were retained in them who were estranged
from her peace; so those also who are more openly without the Church, if
they have received the same sacraments, are not freed from their sins on
coming, after correction, to the unity of the Church, by a repetition of
baptism, but by the same law of charity and bond of unity.  For if
"those only may baptize who are set over the Church, and established by
the law of the gospel and ordination as appointed by the Lord," were
they in any wise of this kind who seized on estates by treacherous
frauds, and increased their gains by compound interest?  I trow not,
since those are established by ordination as appointed of the Lord, of
whom the apostle, in giving them a standard, says, "Not greedy, not
given to filthy lucre."  <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311)  
Yet men of this kind used to baptize in the time of Cyprian himself; and
he confesses with many lamentations that they were his fellow-bishops,
and endures them with the great reward of tolerance.  Yet did they not
confer remission of sins, which is granted through the prayers of the
saints, that is, the groans of the dove, whoever it be that baptizes, if
those to whom it is given belong to her peace.  For the Lord would not
say to robbers and usurers, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they shall be
remitted to him; and whose soever sins ye retain, they shall be
retained."  "Outside the Church, indeed, nothing can be either bound or
loosed, since there there is no one who can either bind or loose;" but
he is loosed who has made peace with the dove, and he is bound who is
not at peace with the dove, whether he is openly without, or appears to
be within.

<span id="v.iv.v.xviii-p6"></span>24.  But we know that Dathan, Korah,
and Abiram, <span id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312) who tried to
usurp to themselves the right of sacrificing, contrary to the unity of
the people of God, and also the sons of Aaron who offered strange fire
upon the altar, <span id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313) did not
escape punishment.  Nor do we say that such offenses remain unpunished,
unless those guilty of them correct themselves, if the patience of God
leading them to repentance <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314)
give them time for correction.
