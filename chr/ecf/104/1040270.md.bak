<span id="v.iv.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—</span>13.  Nor do I think that
the blessed Cyprian had any other motive in the free expression and
earlier utterance of what he thought in opposition to the custom of the
Church, save that he should thankfully receive any one that could be
found with a fuller revelation of the truth, and that he should show
forth a pattern for imitation, not only of diligence in teaching, but
also of modesty in learning; but that, if no one should be found to
bring forward any argument by which those considerations of probability
should be refuted, then he should abide by his opinion, with the full
consciousness that he had neither concealed what he conceived to be the
truth, nor violated the unity which he loved.  For so he understood the
words of the apostle:  "Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the
other judge.  If anything be revealed to another that sitteth by, let
the first hold his peace."  <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238.md)  
"In which passage he has taught and shown, that many things are revealed
to individuals for the better, and that we ought not each to strive
pertinaciously for what he has once imbibed and held, but if anything
has appeared better and more useful, he should willingly embrace
it." <span id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239.md)   At any rate, in these
words he not only advised those to agree with him who saw no better
course, but also exhorted any who could to bring forward arguments by
which the maintenance of the former custom might rather be established;
that if they should be of such a nature as not to admit of refutation,
he might show in his own person with what sincerity he said "that we
ought not each to strive pertinaciously for what he has once imbibed and
held, but that, if anything has appeared better and more useful, he
should willingly embrace it." <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md)
  But inasmuch as none appeared, except such as simply urged the custom
against him, and the arguments which they produced in its favor were not
of a kind to bring conviction to a soul like his, this mighty reasoner
was not content to give up his opinions, which, though they were not
true, as he was himself unable to see, were at any rate not confuted, in
favor of a custom which had truth on its side, but had not yet been
confirmed.  And yet, had not his predecessor Agrippinus, and some of his
fellow-bishops throughout Africa, first tempted him to desert this
custom, even by the decision of a Council, he certainly would not have
dared to argue against it.  But, amid the perplexities of so obscure a
question, and seeing everywhere around him a strong universal custom, he
would rather have put restraint upon himself by prayer and stretching
forth his mind towards God, so as to have perceived or taught that for
truth which was afterwards decided by a plenary Council.  But when he
had found relief amid his weariness in the authority of the former
Council <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) which was held by
Agrippinus, he preferred maintaining what was in a manner the discovery
of his predecessors, to expending further toil in investigation.  For,
at the end of his letter to Quintus, he thus shows how he has sought
repose, if one may use the expression, for his weariness, in what might
be termed the resting-place of authority. <span
