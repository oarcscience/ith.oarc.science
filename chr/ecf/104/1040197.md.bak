id="iv.x.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Individual Good Things, Whether
Small or Great, are from God.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xv-p2"></span>Let us, therefore, bring before our minds
good things however great, which it is fitting that we attribute to God
as their author, and these having been eliminated let us see whether any
nature will remain.  All life both great and small, all power great and
small, all safety great and small, all memory great and small, all
virtue great and small, all intellect great and small, all tranquillity
great and small, all plenty great and small, all sensation great and
small, all light great and small, all suavity <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) great and small, all measure great
and small, all beauty great and small, all peace great and small, and
whatever other like things may occur, especially such as are found
throughout all things, whether spiritual or corporeal, every measure,
every form, every order both great and small, are from the Lord God. 
All which good things whoever should wish to abuse, pays the penalty by
divine judgment; but where none of these things shall have been present
at all, no nature will remain.
