id="iv.x.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Pain Only in Good Natures.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxii-p2"></span>But pain which some suppose to be in an
especial manner an evil, whether it be in mind or in body, cannot exist
except in good natures.  For the very fact of resistance in any being
leading to pain, involves a refusal not to be what it was, because it
was something good; but when a being is compelled to something better,
the pain is useful, when to something worse, it is useless.  Therefore
in the case of the mind, the will resisting a greater power causes pain;
in the case of the body, sensation resisting a more powerful body causes
pain.  But evils without pain are worse:  for it is worse to rejoice
iniquity than to bewail corruption; yet even such rejoicing cannot exist
save from the attainment of inferior good things.  But iniquity is the
desertion of better things.  Likewise in a body, a wound with pain is
better than painless putrescence, which is especially called the
corruption which the dead flesh of the Lord did not see, that is, did
not suffer, as was predicted in prophecy:  "Thou shall not suffer Thy
Holy one to see corruption." <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090)
  For who denies that He was wounded by the piercing of the nails, and
that He was stabbed with the lance? <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091)   But even what is properly called
by men corporeal corruption, that is, putrescence itself, if as yet
there is anything left to consume, increases by the diminution of the
good.  But if corruption shall have absolutely consumed it, so that
there is no good, no nature will remain, for there will be nothing that
corruption may corrupt; and so there will not even be putrescence, for
there will be nowhere at all for it to be.
