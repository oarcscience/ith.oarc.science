id="iv.x.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—That Sin is Not the Striving for
an Evil Nature, But the Desertion of a Better.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxxvi-p2"></span>Likewise because sin, or
unrighteousness, is not the striving after evil nature but the desertion
of better, it is thus found written in the Scriptures:  "Every creature
of God is good." <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md)   And
accordingly every tree also which God planted in Paradise is assuredly
good.  Man did not therefore strive after an evil nature when he touched
the forbidden tree; but by deserting what was better, he committed an
evil deed.  Since the Creator is better than any creature which He has
made, His command should not have been deserted, that the thing
forbidden, however good, might be touched; since the better having been
deserted, the good of the creature was striven for, which was touched
contrary to the command of the Creator.  God did not plant an evil tree
in Paradise; but He Himself was better who prohibited its being touched.
