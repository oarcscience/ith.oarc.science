about the generation of vipers, and the poison of asps under their lips,
and all the other things which they have said against those which have
not known the way of peace, are really, if they would but speak the
truth, more strictly applicable to themselves, since for the sake of the
peace of Donatus they received the baptism of these men, in respect of
which they used the expressions quoted above in the wording of the
decree of the Council; but the baptism of the Church of Christ dispersed
throughout the world, from which peace itself came into Africa, they
repudiate, to the sacrilegious wounding of the peace of Christ.  Which,

what they profess that they shun in the unity of the Church when it
calls for toleration, and does not even certainly exist?
