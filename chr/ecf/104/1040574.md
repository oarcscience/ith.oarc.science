<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 87.—</span>190.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxxxvii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span>
said:  "For neither has the Lord God at any time rejoiced in human
blood, seeing that He was even willing that Cain, the murderer of his
brother, should continue to exist in his murderer’s life."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxvii-p2"></span>191.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxxvii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  If God was
unwilling that death should be inflicted on him who slew his brother,
preferring that he should continue to exist in his murderer’s life, see
whether this be not the cause why, seeing that the heart of the king is
in the hand of God, whereby he has himself enacted many laws for your
correction and reproof, yet no law of the king has commanded that you
should be put to death, perhaps with this very object, that any one of
you who persists in the obstinate self-will of his sacrilegious madness
should be tortured with the punishment of the fratricide Cain, that is
to say, with the life of a murderer.  For we read that many were slain
in mercy by Moses the servant of the Lord; for in that he prayed thus in
intercession to the Lord for their wicked sacrilege, saying, "O Lord, if
Thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of
the book which Thou hast written,"  <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207) his unspeakable charity and mercy
are plainly shown.  Could it be, then, that he was suddenly changed to
cruelty, when, on descending from the mount, he ordered so many
thousands to be slain?  Consider, therefore, whether it may not be a
sign of greater anger on the part of God, that, whilst so many laws have
been enacted against you, you have not been ordered by any emperor to be
put to death.  Or do you think that you are not to be compared to that
fratricide?  Hearken to the Lord speaking through His prophet:  "From
the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name
shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be
offered unto my name, and a pure offering; for my name shall be great
among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts." <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208)   On this brother’s sacrifice you
show that you look with malignant eyes, over and above the respect which
God pays to it; and if ye have ever heard that "from the rising of the
sun, unto the going down of the same, the Lord’s name is to be
praised," <span id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209) which is that
living sacrifice of which it is said, "Offer unto God
thanksgiving," <span id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210) then will your
countenance fall like that of yonder murderer.  But inasmuch as you
cannot kill the whole world, you are involved in the same guilt by your
mere hatred, according to the words of John, "Whosoever hateth his
brother is a murderer." <span id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211)   And
I would that any innocent brother might rather fall into the hands of
your Circumcelliones, to be murdered by their weapons, than be subjected
to the poison of your tongue and rebaptized.
