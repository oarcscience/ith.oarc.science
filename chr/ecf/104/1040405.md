<span id="v.iv.ix.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—</span>10.  Iambus of
Germaniciana <span id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770) said:  "Those
who approve the baptism of heretics disapprove ours, so as to deny that
such as are, I will not say washed, but defiled outside the Church,
ought to be baptized within the Church." <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771)

<span id="v.iv.ix.vi-p4"></span>11.  To him we answer, that none of our
party approves the baptism of heretics, but all the baptism of Christ,
even though it be found in heretics who are as it were chaff outside the
Church, as it may be found in other unrighteous men who are as chaff
within the Church.  For if those who are baptized without the Church are
not washed, but defiled, assuredly those who are baptized outside the
rock on which the Church is built are not washed, but defiled.  But all
are without the said rock who hear the words of Christ and do them not. 
Or if it be the case that they are washed indeed in baptism, but yet
continue in the defilement of their unrighteousness, from which they
were unwilling to be changed for the better, the same is true also of
the heretics.
