<span id="v.iv.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—</span>6.  Next his colleagues
proceed to deliver their several opinions.  But first they listened to
the letter written to Jubaianus; for it was read, as was mentioned in
the preamble.  Let it therefore be read among ourselves also, that we
too, with the help of God, may discover from it what we ought to think. 
"What!" I think I hear some one saying, "do you proceed to tell us what
Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus?"  I have read the letter, I confess, and
should certainly have been a convert to his views, had I not been
induced to consider the matter more carefully by the vast weight of
authority, originating in those whom the Church, distributed throughout
the world amid so many nations, of Latins, Greeks, barbarians, not to
mention the Jewish race itself, has been able to produce,—that same
Church which gave birth to Cyprian himself,—men whom I could in no wise
bring myself to think had been unwilling without reason to hold this
view,—not because it was impossible that in so difficult a question the
opinion of one or of a few might not have been more near the truth than
that of more, but because one must not lightly, without full
consideration and investigation of the matter to the best of his
abilities, decide in favor of a single individual, or even of a few,
against the decision of so very many men of the same religion and
communion, all endowed with great talent and abundant learning.  And so
how much was suggested to me on more diligent inquiry, even by the
letter of Cyprian himself, in favor of the view which is now held by the
Catholic Church, that the baptism of Christ is to be recognized and
approved, not by the standard of their merits by whom it is
administered, but by His alone of whom it is said, "The same is He which
baptizeth," <span id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md) will be shown
naturally in the course of our argument.  Let us therefore suppose that
the letter which was written by Cyprian to Jubaianus has been read among
us, as it was read in the Council. <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md)   And I would have every one read
it who means to read what I am going to say, lest he might possibly
think that I have suppressed some things of consequence.  For it would
take too much time, and be irrelevant to the elucidation of the matter
in hand, were we at this moment to quote all the words of this epistle.
