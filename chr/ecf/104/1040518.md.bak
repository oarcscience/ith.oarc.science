<span id="v.v.iv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—</span>70.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxxi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"For there is no power but of God," <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md) none in any man of power; as the
Lord Jesus Christ answered Pontius Pilate, ‘Thou couldest have no power
at all against me, except it were given thee from above.’ <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md)   And again, in the words of John,
‘A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.’ <span
id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068.md)   Tell us, therefore, *traditor*,
when you received the power of imitating the mysteries."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxi-p5"></span>71.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxi-p5.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Tell us rather
thyself when the power of baptizing was lost by the whole world through
which is dispersed the inheritance of Christ, and by all that multitude
of nations in which the apostles founded the Churches.  You will never
be able to tell us,—not only because you have calumniated them, and do
not prove them to be *traditors*, but because, even if you did prove
this, yet no guilt on the part of any evil-doers, whether they be
unsuspected, or deceitful, or be tolerated as the tares or as the chaff,
can possibly overthrow the promises, so that all the nations of the
earth should not be blessed in the seed of Abraham; in which promises
you deprive them of their share when you will not have the communion of
unity with all nations of the earth.
