<span id="iv.x.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—From the Corruption and Destruction
of Inferior Things is the Beauty of the Universe.</span>

<span id="iv.x.x-p2"></span>But the rest of things that are made of
nothing, which are assuredly inferior to the rational soul, can be
neither blessed nor miserable.  But because in proportion to their
fashion and appearance are things themselves <span id="page_353">p.
353</span> <span id="iv.x.x-Page_353"></span>good, nor could there be
good things in a less or the least degree except from God, they are so
ordered that the more infirm yield to the firmer, the weaker to the
stronger, the more impotent to the more powerful; and so earthly things
harmonize with celestial, as being subject to the things that are
pre-eminent.  But to things falling away, and succeeding, a certain
temporal beauty in its kind belongs, so that neither those things that
die, or cease to be what they were, degrade or disturb the fashion and
appearance and order of the universal creation; as a speech well
composed is assuredly beautiful, although in it syllables and all sounds
rush past as it were in being born and in dying.
