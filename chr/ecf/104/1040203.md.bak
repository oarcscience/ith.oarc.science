<span id="iv.x.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—To Have True Existence is an
Exclusive Prerogative of God.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxi-p2"></span>Magnificently and divinely, therefore, our
God said to his servant:  "I am that I am," <span id="page_355">p.
355</span> <span id="iv.x.xxi-Page_355"></span>and "Thou shalt say to
the children of Israel, He who is sent me to you." <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md)   For He truly is because He is
unchangeable.  For every change makes what was not, to be:  therefore He
truly is, who is unchangeable; but all other things that were made by
Him have received being from Him each in its own measure.  To Him who is
highest, therefore nothing can be contrary, save what is not; and
consequently as from Him everything that is good has its being, so from
Him is everything that by nature exists; since everything that exists by
nature is good.  Thus every nature is good, and everything good is from
God; therefore every nature is from God.
