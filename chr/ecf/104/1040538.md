<span id="v.v.iv.li-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51.—</span>117.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.li-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"If you wretched men claim for yourselves a seat, as we said before, you
assuredly have that one of which the prophet and psalmist David speaks
as being the seat of the scornful. <span
id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133.md)   For to you it is rightly left,
seeing that the holy cannot sit therein."

<span id="v.v.iv.li-p3"></span>118.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.li-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Here again you do
not see that this is no kind of argument, <span id="page_561">p.
561</span> <span id="v.v.iv.li-Page_561"></span>but empty abuse.  For
this is what I said a little while ago, You utter the words of the law,
but take no heed against whom you utter them; just as the devil uttered
the words of the law, but failed to perceive to whom he uttered them. 
He wished to thrust down our Head, who was presently to ascend on high;
but you wish to reduce to a small fraction the body of that same Head
which is dispersed throughout the entire world.  Certainly you yourself
said a little time before that we know the law, and speak in legal
terms, but blush in our deeds.  Thus much indeed you say without a proof
of anything; but even though you were to prove it of some men, you would
not be entitled to assert it of these others.  However, if all men
throughout all the world were of the character which you most vainly
charge them with, what has the chair done to you of the Roman Church, in
which Peter sat, and which Anastasius fills to-day; or the chair of the
Church of Jerusalem, in which James once sat, and in which John sits
today, with which we are united in catholic unity, and from which you
have severed yourselves by your mad fury?  Why do you call the apostolic
chair a seat of the scornful?  If it is on account of the men whom you
believe to use the words of the law without performing it, do you find
that our Lord Jesus Christ was moved by the Pharisees, of whom He says,
"They say, and do not," to do any despite to the seat in which they
sat?  Did He not commend the seat of Moses, and maintain the honor of
the seat, while He convicted those that sat in it?  For He says, "They
sit in Moses’ seat:  all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that
observe and do; but do not ye after their works:  for they say, and do
not." <span id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md)   If you were to think
of these things, you would not, on account of men whom you calumniate,
do despite to the apostolic seat, in which you have no share.  But what
else is conduct like yours but ignorance of what to say, combined with
want of power to abstain from evil-speaking?
