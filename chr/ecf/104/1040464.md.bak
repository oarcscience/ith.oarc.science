<span id="v.v.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—</span>8.  But if it is perfect
madness to hold such a view (for it is Christ always that justifieth the
ungodly, by changing his ungodliness into Christianity; it is from
Christ always that faith is received, Christ is always the origin of the
regenerate and the head of the Church), what weight, then, will those
words have, which thoughtless readers value by their sound, without
inquiring what their inner meaning is?  For the man who does not content
himself with hearing the words with his ear, but considers the meaning
of the phrase, when he hears, "What we look to is the conscience of the
giver, that it may cleanse the conscience of the recipient," will
answer, The conscience of man is often unknown to me, but I am certain
of the mercy of Christ:  when he hears, "He who receives faith from the
faithless receives not faith, but guilt," will answer, Christ is not
faithless, from whom I receive not guilt, but faith:  when he hears,
"Everything consists of an origin and root; and if it have not something
for a head, is nothing," will answer, My origin is Christ, my root is
Christ, my head is Christ.  When he hears, "Nor does anything well
receive second birth, unless it be born again of good seed," he will
answer, The seed of which I am born again is the Word of God, which I am
warned to hear with attention, even though he through whom I hear it
does not himself do what he preaches; according to the words of the
Lord, which make me herein safe, "All whatsoever they bid you observe,
that observe and do; but do not ye after their works:  for they say, and
do not." <span id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md)   When he hears,
"What perversity must it be, that he who is guilty through his own sins
should make another free from guilt!" he will answer, No one makes me
free from guilt but He who died for our sins, and rose again for our
justification.  For I believe, not in the minister by whose hands I am
baptized, but in Him who justifieth the ungodly, that my faith may be
counted unto me for righteousness. <span
