<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—</span>76.  Pusillus of
Lamasba <span id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) said:  "I believe
that baptism is not unto salvation except within the Catholic Church. 
Whatsoever is without the Catholic Church is mere pretense." <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxix-p4"></span>77.  This indeed is true, that
"baptism is not unto salvation except within the Catholic Church."  For
in itself it can indeed exist outside the Catholic Church as well; but
there it is not unto salvation, because there it does not work
salvation; just as that sweet savor of Christ is certainly not unto
salvation in them that perish, <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) though from a fault not in itself,
but in them.  But "whatsoever is without the Catholic Church is mere
pretense," yet only in so far as it is not Catholic.  But there may be
something Catholic outside the Catholic Church, just as the name of
Christ could exist outside the congregation of Christ, in which name he
who did not follow with the disciples was casting out devils. <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md)   For there may be pretense also
within the Catholic Church, as is unquestionable in the case of those
"who renounce the world in words and not in deeds," and yet the pretense
is not Catholic.  As, therefore, there is in the Catholic Church
something which is not Catholic, so there may be something which is
Catholic outside the Catholic Church.
