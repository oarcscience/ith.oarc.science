<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="iv.ix.xxi-p1.1"></span>Book XIX.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p2"></span>Faustus is willing to admit that Christ
may have said that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but
to fulfill them; but if He did, it was to pacify the Jews and in a
modified sense.  Augustin replies, and still further elaborates the
Catholic view of prophecy and its fulfillment.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xxi-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  I will grant that
Christ said that he came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to
fulfill them.  But why did Jesus say this?  Was it to pacify the Jews,
who were enraged at seeing their sacred institutions trampled upon by
Christ, and regarded him as a wild blasphemer, not to be listened to,
much less to be followed?  Or was it for our instruction as Gentile
believers, that we might learn meekly and patiently to bear the yoke of
commandment laid on our necks by the law and the prophets of the Jews? 
You yourself can hardly suppose that Christ’s words were intended to
bring us under the authority of the law and the prophets of the
Hebrews.  So that the other explanation which I have given of the words
must be the true one.  Every one knows that the Jews were always ready
to attack Christ, both with words and with actual violence.  Naturally,
then, they would be enraged at the idea that Christ was destroying their
law and their prophets; and, to appease them, Christ might very well
tell them not to think that he came to destroy the law, but that he came
to fulfill it.  There was no falsehood or deceit in this, for he used
the word law in a general sense, not of any particular law.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p4"></span>2.  There are three laws.  One is that of
the Hebrews, which the apostle calls the law of sin and death. <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md)   The second is that of the Gentiles,
which he calls the law of nature.  "For the Gentiles," he says, "do by
nature the things contained in the law; and, not having the law, they
are a law into themselves; who show the work of the law written on their
hearts." <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md)   The third law is the
truth of which the apostle speaks when he says, "The law of the spirit
of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and
death." <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md)   Since, then, there are
three laws, we must carefully inquire which of the three Christ spoke of
when He said that He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.  In
the same way, there are prophets of the Jews, and prophets of the
Gentiles, and prophets of truth.  With the prophets of the Jews, of
course, every one is acquainted.  If any one is in doubt about the
prophets of the Gentiles, let him hear what Paul says when writing of
the Cretans to Titus:  "A prophet of their own has said, The Cretans are
always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies." <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md)  This proves that the Gentiles also
had their prophets.  The truth also has its prophets, as we learn from
Jesus as well as from Paul.  Jesus says: <span id="page_240">p.
240</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_240"></span>"Behold, I send unto you
wise men and prophets, and some of them ye shall kill in divers
places." <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md)   And Paul says:  "The
Lord Himself appointed first apostles, and then prophets." <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p11"></span>3.  As "the law and the prophets" may
have three different meanings, it is uncertain in what sense the words
are used by Jesus, though we may form a conjecture from what follows. 
For if Jesus had gone on to speak of circumcision, and Sabbaths, and
sacrifices, and the observances of the Hebrews, and had added something
as a fulfillment, there could have been no doubt that it was the law and
the prophets of the Jews of which He said that He came not to destroy,
but to fulfill them.  But Christ, without any allusion to these, speaks
only of commandments which date from the earliest times:  "Thou shall
not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not bear false
witness."  These, it can be proved, were of old promulgated in the world
by Enoch and Seth, and the other righteous men, to whom the precepts
were delivered by angels of lofty rank, in order to tame the savage
nature of men.  From this it appears that Jesus spoke of the law and the
prophets of truth.  And so we find him giving a fulfillment of those
precepts already quoted.  "Ye have heard," He says, "that it was said by
them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; but I say unto you, Be not even
angry."  This is the fulfillment.  Again:  "Ye have heard that it was
said, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, Do not lust
even."  This is the fulfillment.  Again:  "It has been said, Thou shalt
not bear false witness; but I say unto you, Swear not."  This too is the
fulfillment.  He thus both confirms the old precepts and supplies their
defects.  Where He seems to speak of some Jewish precepts, instead of
fulfilling them, He substitutes for them precepts of an opposite
tendency.  He proceeds thus:  "Ye have heard that it has been said, An
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, Whosoever
shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."  This
is not fulfillment, but destruction.  Again:  "It has been said, Thou
shall love thy friend, and hate thine enemy; but I say unto you, Love
your enemies, and pray for your persecutors."  This too is destruction. 
Again:  "It has been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
give her a writing of divorcement; but I say unto you, That whosoever
shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth
her to commit adultery, and is himself an adulterer if he afterwards
marries another woman." <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md)   These
precepts are evidently destroyed because they are the precepts of Moses;
while the others are fulfilled because they are the precepts of the
righteous men of antiquity.  If you agree to this explanation, we may
allow that Jesus said that he came not to destroy the law, but to
fulfill it.  If you disapprove of this explanation, give one of your
own.  Only beware of making Jesus a liar, and of making yourself a Jew,
by binding yourself to fulfill the law because Christ did not destroy
it.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p13"></span>4.  If one of the Nazareans, or
Symmachians, as they are sometimes called, were arguing with me from
these words of Jesus that he came not to destroy the law, I should find
some difficulty in answering him.  For it is undeniable that, at his
coming, Jesus was both in body and mind subject to the influence of the
law and the prophets.  Those people, moreover, whom I allude to,
practise circumcision, and keep the Sabbath, and abstain from swine’s
flesh and such like things, according to the law, although they profess
to be Christians.  They are evidently misled as well as you, by this
verse in which Christ says that he came not to destroy the law, but to
fulfill it.  It would not be easy to reply to such opponents without
first getting rid of this troublesome verse.  But with you I have no
difficulty, for you have nothing to go upon; and instead of using
arguments, you seem disposed, in mere mischief, to induce me to believe
that Christ said what you evidently do not yourself believe him to have
said.  On the strength of this verse you accuse me of dullness and
evasiveness, without yourself giving any indication of keeping the law
instead of destroying it.  Do you too, like a Jew or a Nazarean, glory
in the obscene distinction of being circumcised?  Do you pride yourself
in the observance of the Sabbath?  Can you congratulate yourself on
being innocent of swine’s flesh?  Or can you boast of having gratified
the appetite of the Deity by the blood of sacrifices and the incense of
Jewish offerings?  If not, why do you contend that Christ came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfill it?

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p14"></span>5.  I give unceasing thanks to my
teacher, who prevented me from falling into this error, so that I am
still a Christian.  For I, like you, from reading this verse without
sufficient consideration, had almost resolved to become a Jew.  And with
reason; for if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it,
and as a vessel in order to be filled full must not be <span
id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_241"></span>empty,
but partly filled already, I concluded that no one could become a
Christian but an Israelite, nearly filled already with the law and the
prophets, and coming to Christ to be filled to the full extent of his
capacity.  I concluded, too, that in thus coming he must not destroy
what he already possesses; otherwise it would be a case, not of
fulfilling, but of emptying.  Then it appeared that I, as a Gentile,
could get nothing by coming to Christ, for I brought nothing that he
could fill up by his additions.  This preparatory supply is found, on
inquiry, to consist of Sabbaths, circumcision, sacrifices, new moons,
baptisms, feasts of unleavened bread, distinctions of foods, drink, and
clothes, and other things, too many to specify.  This, then, it
appeared, was what Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. 
Naturally it must appear so:  for what is a law without precepts, or
prophets without predictions?  Besides, there is that terrible curse
pronounced upon those who abide not in all things that are written in
the book of the law to do them.  <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md)
  With the fear of this curse appearing to come from God on the one
side, and with Christ on the other side, seeming, as the Son of God, to
say that he came not to destroy these things, but to fulfill them, what
was to prevent me from becoming a Jew?  The wise instruction of
Manichæus saved me from this danger.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p16"></span>6.  But how can you venture to quote
this verse against me?  Or why should it be against me only, when it is
as much against yourself?  If Christ does not destroy the law and the
prophets, neither must Christians do so.  Why then do you destroy them? 
Do you begin to perceive that you are no Christian?  How can you profane
with all kinds of work the day pronounced sacred in the law and in all
the prophets, on which they say that God, the maker of the world,
himself rested, without dreading the penalty of death pronounced against
Sabbath-breakers, or the curse on the transgressor?  How can you refuse
to receive in your person the unseemly mark of circumcision, which the
law and all the prophets declare to be honorable, especially in the case
of Abraham, after what was thought to be his faith; for does not the God
of the Jews proclaim that whosoever is without this mark of infamy shall
perish from his people?  How can you neglect the appointed sacrifices,
which were made so much of both by Moses and the prophets under the law,
and by Abraham in his faith?  And how can you defile your souls by
making no distinction in foods, if you believe that Christ came not to
destroy these things, but to fulfill them?  Why do you discard the
annual feast of unleavened bread, and the appointed sacrifice of the
lamb, which, according to the law and the prophets, is to be observed
for ever?  Why, in a word, do you treat so lightly the new moons, the
baptisms, and the feast of tabernacles, and all the other carnal
ordinances of the law and the prophets, if Christ did not destroy them? 
I have therefore good reason for saying that, in order to justify your
neglect of these things, you must either abandon your profession of
being Christ’s disciple, or acknowledge that Christ himself has already
destroyed them; and from this acknowledgment it must follow, either that
this text is spurious in which Christ is made to say that he came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfill it, or that the words have an entirely
different meaning from what you suppose.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p17"></span>7.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xxi-p17.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  If you allow, in
consideration of the authority of the Gospel, that Christ said that He
came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, you
should show the same consideration to the authority of the apostle, when
he says, "All these things were our examples;" and again of Christ, "He
was not yea and nay, but in Him was yea; for all the promises of God are
in Him yea;" <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) that is, they are
set forth and fulfilled in Him.  In this way you will see in the
clearest light both what law Christ fulfilled, and how He fulfilled it. 
It is a vain attempt that you make to escape by your three kinds of law
and your three kinds of prophets.  It is quite plain, and the New
Testament leaves no doubt on the matter, what law and what prophets
Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill.  The law given by Moses is
that which by Jesus Christ became grace and truth. <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md)   The law given by Moses is that of
which Christ says, "He wrote of me." <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md)   For undoubtedly this is the law
which entered that the offence might abound; <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) words which you often ignorantly quote
as a reproach to the law.  Read what is there said of this law:  "The
law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  Was then
that which is good made death unto me?  God forbid.  But sin, that it
might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good." <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md)   The entrance of the law made the
offense abound, not because the law required what was wrong, but because
the proud and self-confident incurred additional guilt as transgressors
after their acquaintance with the holy, and just, and good commandments
of the law; so that, being thus humbled, they <span id="page_242">p.
242</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_242"></span>might learn that only by
grace through faith could they be freed from subjection to the law as
transgressors, and be reconciled to the law as righteous.  So the same
apostle says:  "For before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut
up unto the faith which was afterwards revealed.  Therefore the law was
our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus; but after faith came, we are no longer
under a schoolmaster." <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md)   That
is, we are no longer subject to the penalty of the law, because we are
set free by grace.  Before we received in humility the grace of the
Spirit, the letter was only death to us, for it required obedience which
we could not render.  Thus Paul also says:  "The letter killeth, but the
spirit giveth life." <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md)   Again, he
says:  "For if a law had been given which could have given life, verily
righteousness should have been by the law; but the Scripture hath
concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might
be given to them that believe." <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md)
  And once more:  "What the law could not do, in that it was weak
through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of
the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but
after the Spirit." <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md)   Here we see
Christ coming not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.  As the law
brought the proud under the guilt of transgression, increasing their sin
by commandments which they could not obey, so the righteousness of the
same law is fulfilled by the grace of the Spirit in those who learn from
Christ to be meek and lowly in heart; for Christ came not to destroy the
law, but to fulfill it.  Moreover, because even for those who are under
grace it is difficult in this mortal life perfectly to keep what is
written in the law, Thou shall not covet, Christ, by the sacrifice of
His flesh, as our Priest obtains pardon for us.  And in this also He
fulfills the law; for what we fail in through weakness is supplied by
His perfection, who is the Head, while we are His members.  Thus John
says:  "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous:  He is the propitiation for our sins." <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p28"></span>8.  Christ also fulfilled the
prophecies, because the promises of God were made good in Him.  As the
apostle says in the verse quoted above, "The promises of God are in Him
yea."  Again, he says:  "Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of
the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto
the fathers." <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md)   Whatever, then,
was promised in the prophets, whether expressly or in figure, whether by
words or by actions, was fulfilled in Him who came not to destroy the
law and the prophets, but to fulfill them.  You do not perceive that if
Christians were to continue in the use of acts and observances by which
things to come were prefigured, the only meaning would be that the
things prefigured had not yet come.  Either the thing prefigured has not
come, or if it has, the figure becomes superfluous or misleading. 
Therefore, if Christians do not practise some things enjoined in the
Hebrews by the prophets, this, so far from showing, as you think, that
Christ did not fulfill the prophets, rather shows that He did.  So
completely did Christ fulfill what these types prefigured, that it is no
longer prefigured.  So the Lord Himself says:  "The law and the prophets
were until John." <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md)   For the law
which shut up transgressors in increased guilt, and to the faith which
was afterwards revealed, became grace through Jesus Christ, by whom
grace superabounded.  Thus the law, which was not fulfilled in the
requirement of the letter, was fulfilled in the liberty of grace.  In
the same way, everything in the law that was prophetic of the Saviour’s
advent, whether in words or in typical actions, became truth in Jesus
Christ.  For "the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
Jesus Christ." <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md)   At Christ’s
advent the kingdom of God began to be preached; for the law and the
prophets were until John:  the law, that its transgressors might desire
salvation; the prophets, that they might foretell the Saviour.  No doubt
there have been prophets in the Church since the ascension of Christ. 
Of these prophets Paul says:  "God hath set some in the Church, first
apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers," and so on. <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md)   It is not of these prophets that it
was said, "The law and the prophets were until John," but of those who
prophesied the first coming of Christ, which evidently cannot be
prophesied now that it has taken place.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p33"></span>9.  Accordingly, when you ask why a
Christian is not circumcised if Christ came not to destroy the law, but
to fulfill it, my reply is, that a Christian is not circumcised
precisely for this reason, that what was prefigured by circumcision is
fulfilled in Christ.  Circumcision was the type of the removal of our
fleshly nature, which was fulfilled in the resurrection of Christ, and
which the sacrament of baptism teaches us to look forward to in our own
resurrection.  The sacrament of the new <span id="page_243">p.
243</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_243"></span>life is not wholly
discontinued, for our resurrection from the dead is still to come; but
this sacrament has been improved by the substitution of baptism for
circumcision, because now a pattern of the eternal life which is to come
is afforded us in the resurrection of Christ, whereas formerly there was
nothing of the kind.  So, when you ask why a Christian does not keep the
Sabbath, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, my
reply is, that a Christian does not keep the Sabbath precisely because
what was prefigured in the Sabbath is fulfilled in Christ.  For we have
our Sabbath in Him who said, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you, and learn
of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto
your souls." <span id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p35"></span>10.  When you ask why a Christian does
not observe the distinction in food as enjoined in the law, if Christ
came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that a
Christian does not observe this distinction precisely because what was
thus prefigured is now fulfilled in Christ, who admits into His body,
which in His saints He has predestined to eternal life, nothing which in
human conduct corresponds to the characteristics of the forbidden
animals.  When you ask, again, why a Christian does not offer sacrifices
to God of the flesh and blood of slain animals, if Christ came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that it would be improper
for a Christian to offer such sacrifices, now that what was thus
prefigured has been fulfilled in Christ’s offering of His own body and
blood.  When you ask why a Christian does not keep the feast of
unleavened bread as the Jews did, if Christ came not to destroy the law,
but to fulfill it, I reply, that a Christian does not keep this feast
precisely because what was thus prefigured is fulfilled in Christ, who
leads us to a new life by purging out the leaven of the old life. <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md)   When you ask why a Christian does
not keep the feast of the paschal lamb, if Christ came not to destroy
the law, but to fulfill it, my reply is, that he does not keep it
precisely because what was thus prefigured has been fulfilled in the
sufferings of Christ, the Lamb without spot.  When you ask why a
Christian does not keep the feasts of the new moon appointed in the law,
if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that
he does not keep them precisely because what was thus prefigured is
fulfilled in Christ.  For the feast of the new moon prefigured the new
creature, of which the apostle says:  "If therefore there is any new
creature in Christ Jesus, the old things have passed away; behold, all
things are become new." <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md)   When
you ask why a Christian does not observe the baptisms for various kinds
of uncleanness according to the law, if Christ came not to destroy the
law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that he does not observe them precisely
because they were figures of things to come, which Christ has
fulfilled.  For He came to bury us with Himself by baptism into death,
that as Christ rose again from the dead, so we also should walk in
newness of life. <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md)   When you ask
why Christians do not keep the feast of tabernacles, if the law is not
destroyed, but fulfilled by Christ, I reply that believers are God’s
tabernacle, in whom, as they are united and built together in love, God
condescends to dwell, so that Christians do not keep this feast
precisely because what was thus prefigured is now fulfilled by Christ in
His Church.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p39"></span>11.  I touch upon these things merely in
passing with the utmost brevity, rather than omit them altogether.  The
subjects, taken separately, have filled many large volumes, written to
prove that these observances were typical of Christ.  So it appears that
all the things in the Old Testament which you think are not observed by
Christians because Christ destroyed the law, are in fact not observed
because Christ fulfilled the law.  The very intention of the observances
was to prefigure Christ.  Now that Christ has come, instead of its being
strange or absurd that what was done to prefigure His advent should not
be done any more, it is perfectly right and reasonable.  The typical
observances intended to prefigure the coming of Christ would be observed
still, had they not been fulfilled by the coming of Christ; so far is it
from being the case that our not observing them now is any proof of
their not being fulfilled by Christ’s coming.  There can be no religious
society, whether the religion be true or false, without some sacrament
or visible symbol to serve as a bond of union.  The importance of these
sacraments cannot be overstated, and only scoffers will treat them
lightly.  For if piety requires them, it must be impiety to neglect
them.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p40"></span>12.  It is true, the ungodly may partake
in the visible sacraments of godliness, as we read that Simon Magus
received holy baptism.  Such are they of whom the apostle says that
"they have the form of godliness, but deny the power of it." <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md)   The power of godliness is the end of
the commandment, <span id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_244"></span>that is, love out of a pure heart, and of
a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned. <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md)   So the Apostle Peter, speaking of
the sacrament of the ark, in which the family of Noah was saved from the
deluge, says, "So by a similar figure baptism also saves you."  And lest
they should rest content with the visible sacrament, by which they had
the form of godliness, and should deny its power in their lives by
profligate conduct, he immediately adds, "Not the putting away of the
filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience." <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p44"></span>13.  Thus the sacraments of the Old
Testament, which were celebrated in obedience to the law, were types of
Christ who was to come; and when Christ fulfilled them by His advent
they were done away, and were done away because they were fulfilled. 
For Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. And now that the
righteousness of faith is revealed, and the children of God are called
into liberty, and the yoke of bondage which was required for a carnal
and stiffnecked people is taken away, other sacraments are instituted,
greater in efficacy, more beneficial in their use, easier in
performance, and fewer in number.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p45"></span>14.  And if the righteous men of old,
who saw in the sacraments of their time the promise of a future
revelation of faith, which even then their piety enabled them to discern
in the dim light of prophecy, and by which they lived, for the just can
live only by faith; <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) if, then,
these righteous men of old were ready to suffer, as many actually did
suffer, all trials and tortures for the sake of those typical sacraments
which prefigured things in the future; if we praise the three children
and Daniel, because they refused to be defiled by meat from the king’s
table, from their regard for the sacrament of their day; if we feel the
strongest admiration for the Maccabees, who refused to touch food which
Christians lawfully use;  <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) how
much more should a Christian in our day be ready to suffer all things
for Christ’s baptism, for Christ’s Eucharist, for Christ’s sacred sign,
since these are proofs of the accomplishment of what the former
sacraments only pointed forward to in the future!  For what is still
promised to the Church, the body of Christ, is both clearly made known,
and in the Saviour Himself, the Head of the body, the Mediator between
God and men, the man Christ Jesus, has already been accomplished.  Is
not the promise of eternal life by resurrection from the dead?  This we
see fulfilled in the flesh of Him of whom it is said, that the Word
became flesh and dwelt among us. <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md)
  In former days faith was dim, for the saints and righteous men of
those times all believed and hoped for the same things, and all these
sacraments and ceremonies pointed to the future; but now we have the
revelation of the faith to which the people were shut up under the
law; <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) and what is now promised to
believers in the judgment is already accomplished in the example of Him
who came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p50"></span>15.  It is a question among the students
of the sacred Scriptures, whether the faith in Christ before His passion
and resurrection, which the righteous men of old learned by revelation
or gathered from prophecy, had the same efficacy as faith has now that
Christ has suffered and risen; or whether the actual shedding of the
blood of the Lamb of God, which was, as He Himself says, for many for
the remission of sins, <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) conferred
any benefit in the way of purifying or adding to the purity of those who
looked forward in faith to the death of Christ, but left the world
before it took place; whether, in fact, Christ’s death reached to the
dead, so as to effect their liberation.  To discuss this question here,
or to prove what has been ascertained on the subject, would take too
long, besides being foreign from our present purpose.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p52"></span>16.  Meanwhile it is sufficient to
prove, in opposition to Faustus’ ignorant cavils, how greatly they
mistake who conclude, from the change in signs and sacraments, that
there must be a difference in the things which were prefigured in the
rites of a prophetic dispensation, and which are declared to be
accomplished in the rites of the gospel; or those, on the other hand,
who think that as the things are the same, the sacraments which announce
their accomplishment should not differ from the sacraments which
foretold that accomplishment.  For if in language the form of the verb
changes in the number of letters and syllables according to the tense,
as *done* signifies the past, and *to be done* the future, why should
not the symbols which declare Christ’s death and resurrection to be
accomplished, differ from those which predicted their accomplishment, as
we see a difference in the form and sound of the words, past and future,
suffered and to suffer, risen and to rise?  For material symbols are
nothing else than visible speech, which, though sacred, is changeable
and transitory.  For while God is eternal, the water of baptism, and all
that is material in the sacrament, is transitory:  the very word "God,"
which must be pronounced in the consecration, is a sound which <span
id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_245"></span>passes
in a moment.  The actions and sounds pass away, but their efficacy
remains the same, and the spiritual gift thus communicated is eternal. 
To say, therefore, that if Christ had not destroyed the law and the
prophets, the sacraments of the law and the prophets would continue to
be observed in the congregations of the Christian Church, is the same as
to say that if Christ had not destroyed the law and the prophets, He
would still be predicted as about to be born, to suffer, and to rise
again; whereas, in fact, it is proved that He did not destroy, but
fulfill those things, because the prophecies of His birth, and passion,
and resurrection, which were represented in these ancient sacraments,
have ceased, and the sacraments now observed by Christians contain the
announcement that He has been born, has suffered, has risen.  He who
came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, by
this fulfillment did away with those things which foretold the
accomplishment of what is thus shown to be now accomplished.  Precisely
in the same way, he might substitute for the expressions, "He is to be
born, is to suffer, is to rise," which were in these times appropriate,
the expressions, "He has been born, has suffered, has risen," which are
appropriate now that the others are accomplished, and so done away.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p53"></span>17.  Corresponding to this change in
words is the change which naturally took place in the substitution of
new sacraments instead of those of the Old Testament.  In the case of
the first Christians, who came to the faith as Jews, it was by degrees
that they were brought to change their customs, and to have a clear
perception of the truth; and permission was given them by the apostle to
preserve their hereditary worship and belief, in which they had been
born and brought up; and those who had to do with them were required to
make allowance for this reluctance to accept new customs.  So the
apostle circumcised Timothy, the son of a Jewish mother and a Greek
father, when they went among people of this kind; and he himself
accommodated his practice to theirs, not hypocritically, but for a wise
purpose.  For these practices were harmless in the case of those born
and brought up in them, though they were no longer required to prefigure
things to come.  It would have done more harm to condemn them as hurtful
in the case of those to whose time it was intended that they should
continue.  Christ, who came to fulfill all these prophecies, found those
people trained in their own religion.  But in the case of those who had
no such training, but were brought to Christ, the corner-stone, from the
opposite wall of circumcision, there was no obligation to adopt Jewish
customs.  If, indeed, like Timothy, they chose to accommodate themselves
to the views of those of the circumcision who were still wedded to their
old sacraments, they were free to do so.  But if they supposed that
their hope and salvation depended on these works of the law, they were
warned against them as a fatal danger.  So the apostle says:  "Behold, I
Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
nothing;" <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) that is, if they were
circumcised, as they were intending to be, in compliance with some
corrupt teachers, who told them that without these works of the law they
could not be saved.  For when, chiefly through the preaching of the
Apostle Paul, the Gentiles were coming to the faith of Christ, as it was
proper that they should come, without being burdened with Jewish
observances—for those who were grown up were deterred from the faith by
fear of ceremonies to which they were not accustomed, especially of
circumcision; and if they who had not been trained from their birth to
such observances had been made proselytes in the usual way, it would
have implied that the coming of Christ still required to be predicted as
a future event;—when, then, the Gentiles were admitted without these
ceremonies, those of the circumcision who believed, not understanding
why the Gentiles were not required to adopt their customs, nor why they
themselves were still allowed to retain them, began to disturb the
Church with carnal contentions, because the Gentiles were admitted into
the people of God without being made proselytes in the usual way by
circumcision and the other legal observances.  Some also of the
converted Gentiles were bent on these ceremonies, from fear of the Jews
among whom they lived.  Against these Gentiles the Apostle Paul often
wrote, and when Peter was carried away by their hypocrisy, he corrected
him with a brotherly rebuke.  <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md)  
Afterwards, when the apostles met in council, decreed that these works
of the law were not obligatory in the case of the Gentiles, <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) some Christians of the circumcision
were displeased, because they failed to understand that these
observances were permissible only in those who had been trained in them
before the revelation of faith, to bring to a close the prophetic life
in those who were engaged in it before the prophecy was fulfilled, lest
by a compulsory abandonment it should seem to be condemned rather than
closed; while to lay these things on the Gentiles would imply either
that they <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_246"></span>were not instituted to prefigure Christ,
or that Christ was still to be prefigured.  The ancient people of God,
before Christ came to fulfill the law and the prophets, were required to
observe all these things by which Christ was prefigured.  It was freedom
to those who understood the meaning of the observance, but it was
bondage to those who did not.  But the people in those latter times who
come to believe in Christ as having already come, and suffered, and
risen, in the case of those whom this faith found trained to those
sacraments, are neither required to observe them, nor prohibited from
doing so; while there is a prohibition in the case of those who were not
bound by the ties of custom, or by any necessity, to accommodate
themselves to the practice of others, so that it might become manifest
that these things were instituted to prefigure Christ, and that after
His coming they were to cease, because the promises had been fulfilled. 
Some believers of the circumcision who did not understand this were
displeased with this tolerant arrangement which the Holy Spirit effected
through the apostles, and stubbornly insisted on the Gentiles becoming
Jews.  These are the people of whom Faustus speaks under the name of
Symmachians or Nazareans.  Their number is now very small, but the sect
still continues.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p57"></span>18.  The Manichæans, therefore have no
ground for saying, in disparagement of the law and the prophets, that
Christ came to destroy rather than to fulfill them, because Christians
do not observe what is there enjoined:  for the only things which they
do not observe are those that prefigured Christ, and these are not
observed because their fulfillment is in Christ, and what is fulfilled
is no longer prefigured; the typical observances having properly come to
a close in the time of those who, after being trained in such things,
had come to believe in Christ as their fulfillment.  Do not Christians
observe the precept of Scripture "Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is
one God;" "Thou shalt not make unto thee an image," and so on?  Do make
Christians not observe the precept, "Thou shalt not take the name of the
Lord thy God in vain?"  Do Christians not observe the Sabbath, even in
the sense of a true rest?  Do Christians not honor their parents,
according to the commandment?  Do Christians not abstain from
fornication, and murder, and theft, and false witness, from coveting
their neighbor’s wife, and from coveting his property,—all of which
things are written in the law?  These moral precepts are distinct from
typical sacraments:  the former are fulfilled by the aid of divine
grace, the latter by the accomplishment of what they promise.  Both are
fulfilled in Christ, who has ever been the bestower of this grace, which
is also now revealed in Him, and who now makes manifest the
accomplishment of what He in former times promised; for "the law was
given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md)   Again, these things which concern
the keeping of a good conscience are fulfilled in the faith which
worketh by love; <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) while types of
the future pass away when they are accomplished.  But even the types are
not destroyed, but fulfilled; for Christ, in bringing to light what the
types signified, does not prove them vain or illusory.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p60"></span>19.  Faustus, therefore, is wrong in
supposing that the Lord Jesus fulfilled some precepts of righteous men
who lived before the law of Moses, such as, "Thou shall not kill," which
Christ did not oppose, but rather confirmed by His prohibition of anger
and abuse; and that He destroyed some things apparently peculiar to the
Hebrew law, such as, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," which
Christ seems rather to abolish than to confirm, when He says, "But I say
unto you, that ye resist not evil; but if any one smite thee on thy
right cheek, turn to him the other also," <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) and so on.  But we say that even these
things which Faustus thinks Christ destroyed by enjoining the opposite,
were suitable to the times of the Old Testament, and were not destroyed,
but fulfilled by Christ.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p62"></span>20.  In the first place let me ask our
opponents if these ancient righteous men, Enoch and Seth, whom Faustus
mentions particularly, and any others who lived before Moses, or even,
if you choose, before Abraham, were angry with their brother without a
cause, or said to their brother, Thou fool.  If not, why may they not
have taught these things as well as preached them?  And if they taught
these things, how can Christ be said to have fulfilled their
righteousness or their teaching, any more than that of Moses, by adding,
"But I say unto you, if any man is angry with his brother, or if he says
Racha, or if he says, Thou fool, he shall be in danger of the judgment,
or of the council, or of hell-fire," since these men did these very
things themselves, and enjoined them upon others?  Will it be said that
they were ignorant of its being the duty of a righteous man to restrain
his passion, and not to provoke his brother with angry abuse; or that,
knowing this, they were unable to act accordingly?  In that case, they
deserved the punishment of hell, <span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_247"></span>and could not have been righteous.  But
no one will venture to say that in their righteousness there was such
ignorance of duty, and such a want of self-control, as to make them
liable to the punishment of hell.  How, then, can Christ be said to have
fulfilled the law, by which these men lived by means of adding things
without which they could have had no righteousness at all?  Will it be
said that a hasty temper and bad language are sinful only since the time
of Christ, while formerly such qualities of the heart and speech were
allowable; as we find some institutions vary according to the times, so
that what is proper at one time is improper at another, and *vice
versa?*  You will not be so foolish as to make this assertion.  But even
were you to do so, the reply will be that, according to this idea,
Christ came not to fulfill what was defective in the old law, but to
institute a law which did not previously exist; if it is true that with
the righteous men of old it was not a sin to say to their brother, Thou
fool, which Christ pronounces so sinful, that whoever does so is in
danger of hell.  So, then, you have not succeeded in finding any law of
which it can be said that Christ supplied its defect by these additions.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p63"></span>21.  Will it be said that the law in
these early times was incomplete as regards not committing adultery,
till it was completed by the Lord, who added that no one should look on
a woman to lust after her?  This is what you imply in the way you quote
the words, "Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt not commit
adultery:  but I say unto you, Do not lust even."  "Here," you say, "is
the fulfillment."  But let us take the words as they stand in the
Gospel, without any of your modifications, and see what character you
give to those righteous men of antiquity.  The words are:  "Ye have
heard that it has been said, thou shall not commit adultery; but I say
unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath
committed adultery with her already in his heart." <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md)   In your opinion, then, Enoch and
Seth, and the rest, committed adultery in their hearts; and either their
heart was not the temple of God, or they committed adultery in the
temple of God.  But if you dare not say this, how can you say that
Christ, when He came, fulfilled the law, which was already in the time
of those men complete?

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p65"></span>22.  As regards not swearing, in which
also you say that Christ completed the law given to these righteous men
of antiquity, I cannot be certain that they did not swear, for we find
that Paul the apostle swore.  With you, swearing is still a common
practice, for you swear by the light, which you love as flies do; for
the light of the mind which lighteth every man that cometh into the
world, as distinct from mere natural light, you know nothing of.  You
swear, too, by your master Manichæus, whose name in his own tongue was
Manes.  As the name Manes seemed to be connected with the Greek word for
madness, you have changed it by adding a suffix, which only makes
matters worse, by giving the new meaning of pouring forth madness.  One
of your own sect told me that the name Manichæus was intended to be
derived from the Greek words for pouring forth manna; for <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ix.xxi-p65.1"></span>χέειν</span> means to
pour.  But, as it is, you only express the idea of madness with greater
emphasis.  For by adding the two syllables, while you have forgotten to
insert another letter in the beginning of the word, you make it not
Mannichæus, but Manichæus; which must mean that he pours forth madness
in his long unprofitable discourses.  Again, you often swear by the
Paraclete,—not the Paraclete promised and sent by Christ to His
disciples, but this same madness-pourer himself.  Since, then, you are
constantly swearing, I should like to know in what sense you make Christ
to have fulfilled this part of the law, which is one you mention as
belonging to the earliest times.  And what do you make of the oaths of
the apostle?  For as to your authority, it cannot weigh much with
yourselves, not to speak of me or any other person.  It is therefore
evident that Christ’s words, "I am come not to destroy the law, but to
fulfill it," have not the meaning which you give them.  Christ makes no
reference in these words to His comments on the ancient sayings which He
quotes, and of which His discourse was an explanation, but not a
fulfillment.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p66"></span>23.  Thus, as regards murder, which was
understood to mean merely the destruction of the body, by which a man is
deprived of life, the Lord explained that every unjust disposition to
injure our brother is a kind of murder.  So John also says, "He that
hateth his brother is a murderer." <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md)   And as it was thought that adultery
meant only the act of unlawful intercourse with a woman, the Master
showed that the lust He describes is also adultery.  Again, because
perjury is a heinous sin, while there is no sin either in not swearing
at all or in swearing truly, the Lord wished to secure us from departing
from the truth by not swearing at all, rather than that <span
id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_248"></span>we
should be in danger of perjury by being in the habit of swearing truly. 
For one who never swears is less in danger of swearing falsely than one
who is in the habit of swearing truly.  So, in the discourses of the
apostle which are recorded, he never used an oath, lest he should ever
fall unawares into perjury from being in the habit of swearing.  In his
writings, on the other hand, where he had more leisure and opportunity
for caution, we find him using oaths in several places, <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) to teach us that there is no sin in
swearing truly, but that, on account of the infirmity of human nature,
we are best preserved from perjury by not swearing at all.  These
considerations will also make it evident that the things which Faustus
supposes to be peculiar to Moses were not destroyed by Christ, as he
says they were.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p69"></span>24.  To take, for instance, this saying
of the ancients, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy,"
how does Faustus make out that this is peculiar to Moses?  Does not the
Apostle Paul speak of some men as hateful to God? <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md)   And, indeed, in connection with this
saying, the Lord enjoins on us that we should imitate God.  His words
are:  "That ye may be the children of your Father in heaven, who maketh
the sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just
and the unjust." <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md)   In one sense
we must hate our enemies, after the example of God, to whom Paul says
some men are hateful; while, at the same time, we must also love our
enemies after the example of God, who makes the sun to rise on the evil
and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.  If we
understand this, we shall find that the Lord, in explaining to those who
did not rightly understand the saying, Thou shalt hate thine enemy, made
use of it to show that they should love their enemy, which was a new
idea to them.  It would take too long to show the consistency of the two
things here.  But when the Manichæans condemn without exception the
precept, Thou shall hate thine enemy, they may easily be met with the
question whether their god loves the race of darkness.  Or, if we should
love our enemies now, because they have a part of good, should we not
also hate them as having a part of evil?  So even in this way it would
appear that there is no opposition between the saying of ancient times,
Thou shall hate thine enemy, and that of the Gospel, Love your enemies. 
For every wicked man should be hated as far as he is wicked; while he
should be loved as a man.  The vice which we rightly hate in him is to
be condemned, that by its removal the human nature which we rightly love
in him may be amended.  This is precisely the principle we maintain,
that we should hate our enemy for what is evil in him, that is, for his
wickedness; while we also love our enemy for that which is good in him,
that is, for his nature as a social and rational being.  The difference
between us and the Manichæans is, that we prove the man to be wicked,
not by nature, either his own or any other, but by his own will; whereas
they think that a man is evil on account of the nature of the race of
darkness, which, according to them, was an object of dread to God when
he existed entire, and by which also he was partly conquered, so that he
cannot be entirely set free.  The intention of the Lord, then, is to
correct those who, from knowing without understanding what was said by
them of old time, Thou shalt hate thine enemy, hated their fellow-men
instead of only hating their wickedness; and for this purpose He says,
Love your enemies.  Instead of destroying what is written about hatred
of enemies in the law, of which He said, "I am come not to destroy the
law, but to fulfill it," He would have us learn, from the duty of loving
our enemies, how it is possible in the case of one and the same person,
both to hate him for his sin, and to love him for his nature.  It is too
much to expect our perverse opponents to understand this.  But we can
silence them, by showing that by their irrational objection they condemn
their own god, of whom they cannot say that he loves the race of
darkness; so that in enjoining on every one to love his enemy, they
cannot quote his example.  There would appear to be more love of their
enemy in the race of darkness than in the god of the Manichæans.  The
story is, that the race of darkness coveted the domain of light
bordering on their territory, and, from a desire to possess it, formed
the plan of invading it.  Nor is there any sin in desiring true goodness
and blessedness.  For the Lord says, "The kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence, and the violent take it by force." <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md)   This fabulous race of darkness,
then, wished to take by force the good they desired, for its beautiful
and attractive appearance.  But God, instead of returning the love of
those who wished to possess Him, hated it so as to endeavor to
annihilate them.  If, therefore, the evil love the good in the desire to
possess it, while the good hate the evil in fear of being defiled, I ask
the Manichæans, which of these obeys the precept of the Lord, "Love your
enemies"?  If you insist on making these precepts opposed to one <span
id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_249"></span>another, it will follow that your god
obeyed what is written in the law of Moses, "Thou shall hate thine
enemy"; while the race of darkness obeyed what is written in the Gospel,
"Love your enemies."  However, you have never succeeded in explaining
the difference between the flies that fly in the day-time and the moths
that fly at night; for both, according to you, belong to the race of
darkness.  How is it that one kind love the light, contrary to their
nature; while the other kind avoid it, and prefer the darkness from
which they sprung?  Strange, that filthy sewers should breed a cleaner
sort than dark closets!

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p73"></span>25.  Nor, again, is there any opposition
between that which was said by them of old time, "An eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth," and what the Lord says, "But I say unto you, that ye
resist not evil; but if any one smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to
him the other also," and so on. <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md)
  The old precept as well as the new is intended to check the vehemence
of hatred, and to curb the impetuosity of angry passion.  For who will
of his own accord be satisfied with a revenge equal to the injury?  Do
we not see men, only slightly hurt, eager for slaughter, thirsting for
blood, as if they could never make their enemy suffer enough?  If a man
receives a blow, does he not summon his assailant, that he may be
condemned in the court of law?  Or if he prefers to return the blow,
does he not fall upon the man with hand and heel, or perhaps with a
weapon, if he can get hold of one?  To put a restraint upon a revenge so
unjust from its excess, the law established the principle of
compensation, that the penalty should correspond to the injury
inflicted.  So the precept, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,"
instead of being a brand to kindle a fire that was quenched, was rather
a covering to prevent the fire already kindled from spreading.  For
there is a just revenge due to the injured person from his assailant; so
that when we pardon, we give up what we might justly claim.  Thus, in
the Lord’s prayer, we are taught to forgive others their debts that God
may forgive us our debts.  There is no injustice in asking back a debt,
though there is kindness in forgiving it.  But as, in swearing, one who
swears, even though truly, is in danger of perjury, of which one is in
no danger who never swears; and while swearing truly is not a sin, we
are further from sin by not swearing; so that the command not to swear
is a guard against perjury:  in the same way since it is sinful to wish
to be revenged with an unjust excess, though there is no sin in wishing
for revenge within the limits of justice, the man who wishes for no
revenge at all is further from the sin of an unjust revenge.  It is sin
to demand more than is due, though it is no sin to demand a debt.  And
the best security against the sin of making an unjust demand is to
demand nothing, especially considering the danger of being compelled to
pay the debt to Him who is indebted to none.  Thus, I would explain the
passage as follows:  It has been said by them of old time, Thou shall
not take unjust revenge; but I say, Take no revenge at all:  here is the
fulfillment.  It is thus that Faustus, after quoting, "It has been said,
Thou shall not swear falsely; but I say unto you, swear not at all,"
adds:  here is the fulfillment.  I might use the same expression if I
thought that by the addition of these words Christ supplied a defect in
the law, and not rather that the intention of the law to prevent unjust
revenge is best secured by not taking revenge at all, in the same way as
the intention to prevent perjury is best secured by not swearing at
all.  For if "an eye for an eye" is opposed to "If any one smite thee on
the cheek, turn to him the other also," is there not as much opposition
between "Thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath," and "Swear not at
all?" <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md)   If Faustus thinks that
there is not destruction, but fulfillment, in the one case, he ought to
think the same of the other.  For if "Swear not" is the fulfillment of
"Swear truly," why should not "Take no revenge" be the fulfillment of
"Take revenge justly"?

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p76"></span>So, according to my interpretation,
there is in both cases a guard against sin, either of false swearing or
of unjust revenge; though, as regards giving up the right to revenge,
there is the additional consideration that, by forgiving such debts, we
shall obtain the forgiveness of our debts.  The old precept was required
in the case of a self-willed people, to teach them not to be extravagant
in their demands.  Thus, when the rage eager for unrestrained vengeance,
was subdued, there would be leisure for any one so disposed to consider
the desirableness of having his own debt cancelled by the Lord, and so
to be led by this consideration to forgive the debt of his
fellow-servant.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p77"></span>26.  Again, we shall find on
examination, that there is no opposition between the precept of the Lord
about not putting away a wife, and what was said by them of old time: 
"Whosoever putteth away his wife, let him give her a writing of
divorcement." <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md)   The Lord
explains the intention of the law, which <span id="page_250">p.
250</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_250"></span>required a bill of
divorce in every case where a wife was put away.  The precept not to put
away a wife is the opposite of saying that a man may put away his wife
if he pleases; which is not what the law says.  On the contrary, to
prevent the wife from being put away, the law required this intermediate
step, that the eagerness for separation might be checked by the writing
of the bill, and the man might have time to think of the evil of putting
away his wife; especially since, as it is said, among the Hebrews it was
unlawful for any but the scribes to write Hebrew:  for the scribes
claimed the possession of superior wisdom; and if they were men of
upright and pious character, their pursuits might justly entitle them to
make this claim.  In requiring, therefore, that in putting away his
wife, a man should give her a writing of divorcement, the design was
that he should be obliged to have recourse to those from whom he might
expect to receive a cautious interpretation of the law, and suitable
advice against separation.  Having no other way of getting the bill
written, the man should be obliged to submit to their direction, and to
allow of their endeavors to restore peace and harmony between him and
his wife.  In a case where the hatred could not be overcome or checked,
the bill would of course be written.  A wife might with reason be put
away when wise counsel failed to restore the proper feeling and
affection in the mind of her husband.  If the wife is not loved, she is
to be put away.  And that she may not be put away, it is the husband’s
duty to love her.  Now, while a man cannot be forced to love against his
will, he may be influenced by advice and persuasion.  This was the duty
of the scribe, as a wise and upright man; and the law gave him the
opportunity, by requiring the husband in all cases of quarrel to go to
him, to get the bill of divorcement written.  No good or prudent man
would write the bill unless it were a case of such obstinate aversion as
to make reconciliation impossible.  But according to your impious
notions, there can be nothing in putting away a wife; for matrimony,
according to you, is a criminal indulgence.  The word "matrimony" shows
that a man takes a wife in order that she may become a mother, which
would be an evil in your estimation.  According to you, this would imply
that part of your god is overcome and captured by the race of darkness,
and bound in the fetters of flesh.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p79"></span>27.  But, to explain the point in hand: 
If Christ, in adding the words, "But I say unto you," to the quotations
He makes of ancient sayings, neither fulfilled the law of primitive
times by His additions, nor destroyed the law given to Moses by opposite
precepts, but rather paid such deference to the Hebrew law in all the
quotations He made from it, as to make His own remarks chiefly
explanatory of what the law stated less distinctly, or a means of
securing the design intended by the law, it follows that from the words,
"I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it" we are not to
understand that Christ by His precepts filled up what was wanting in the
law; but that what the literal command failed in doing from the pride
and disobedience of men, is accomplished by grace in those who are
brought to repentance and humility.  The fulfillment is not in
additional words, but in acts of obedience.  So the apostle says "Faith
worketh by love;"  <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) and again, He
that loveth another hath fulfilled the law." <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md)   This love, by which also the
righteousness of the law can be fulfilled was bestowed in its
significance by Christ in His coming, through the spirit which He sent
according to His promise; and therefore He said, "I came not to destroy
the law, but to fulfill it."  This is the New Testament in which the
promise of the kingdom of heaven is made to this love; which was
typified in the Old Testament, suitably to the times of that
dispensation.  So Christ says again; "A new commandment I give unto you,
that ye love one another." <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p83"></span>28.  So we find in the Old Testament all
or nearly all the counsels and precepts which Christ introduces with the
words "But I say unto you."  Against anger it is written, "Mine eyes
troubled because of anger;" <span id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md) and
again, "Better is he that conquers his anger, than he that taketh a
city." <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md)   Against hard words,
"The stroke of a whip maketh a wound; but the stroke of the tongue
breaketh the bones." <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md)   Against
adultery in the heart, "Thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s wife." <span
id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md)   It is not, "Thou shall not commit
adultery;" but, "Thou shall not covet."  The apostle, in quoting this,
says:  "I had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not
covet." <span id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md)   Regarding patience in
not offering resistance, a man is praised who "giveth his cheek to him
that smiteth him, and who is filled full with reproach." <span
id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md)   Of love to enemies it is said:  "If
thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink." <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md)   This also is quoted by the
apostle. <span id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md)   In the Psalm, too, it
is said, "I was a peace <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_251"></span>maker among them that hated peace;" <span
id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) and in many similar passages.  In
connection also with our imitating God in refraining from taking
revenge, and in loving even the wicked, there is a passage containing a
full description of God in this character; for it is written:  "To Thee
alone ever belongeth great strength, and who can withstand the power of
Thine arm?  For the whole world before Thee is as a little grain of the
balance; yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon the
earth.  But Thou hast mercy upon all, for Thou canst do all things, and
winkest at the sins of men, because of repentance.  For Thou lovest all
things that are, and abhorrest nothing which Thou hast made; for never
wouldest Thou have made anything if Thou hadst hated it.  And how could
anything have endured, if it had not been Thy will? or been preserved,
if not called by Thee?  But Thou sparest all; for they are Thine, O
Lord, Thou lover of souls.  For Thy good Spirit is in all things;
therefore chastenest Thou them by little and little that offend, and
warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have offended,
that learning their wickedness, they may believe in Thee, O Lord." <span
id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md)   Christ exhorts us to imitate this
long-suffering goodness of God, who maketh the sun to rise upon the evil
and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust; that we
may not be careful to revenge, but may do good to them that hate us, and
so may be perfect, even as our Father in heaven is perfect. <span
id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md)   From another passage in these
ancient books we learn that, by not exacting the vengeance due to us, we
obtain the remission of our own sins; and that by not forgiving the
debts of others, we incur the danger of being refused forgiveness when
we pray for the remission of our own debts:  "He that revengeth shall
find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep his sin in
remembrance.  Forgive thy neighbor the hurt that he hath done to thee;
so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.  One man beareth
hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon of the Lord?  He showeth
no mercy to a man who is like himself; and doth he ask forgiveness of
his own sins?  If he that is but flesh nourishes hatred, and asks for
favor from the Lord, who will entreat for the pardon of his sins?" <span
id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p96"></span>29.  As regards not putting away a wife,
there is no need to quote any other passage of the Old Testament than
that referred to most appropriately in the Lord’s reply to the Jews when
they questioned Him on this subject.  For when they asked whether it is
lawful for a man to put away his wife for any reason, the Lord
answered:  "Have ye not read, that He that made them at the beginning
made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave
his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall
be one flesh?  Therefore they are no longer twain, but one flesh.  What
therefore God hath joined, let no man put asunder." <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md)   Here the Jews, who thought that they
acted according to the intention of the law of Moses in putting away
their wives, are made to see from the book of Moses that a wife should
not be put away.  And, by the way, we learn here, from Christ’s own
declaration, that God made and joined male and female; so that by
denying this, the Manichæans are guilty of opposing the gospel of Christ
as well as the writings of Moses.  And supposing their doctrine to be
true, that the devil made and joined male and female, we see the
diabolical cunning of Faustus in finding fault with Moses for dissolving
marriages by granting a bill of divorce, and praising Christ for
strengthening the union by the precept in the Gospel.  Instead of this,
Faustus, consistently with his own foolish and impious notions, should
have praised Moses for separating what was made and joined by the devil,
and should have blamed Christ for ratifying a bond of the devil’s
workmanship.  To return, let us hear the good Master explain how Moses,
who wrote of the conjugal chastity in the first union of male and female
as so holy and inviolable, afterwards allowed the people to put away
their wives.  For when the Jews replied, "Why did Moses then command to
give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?"  Christ said unto
them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your heart, suffered you to put
away your wives." <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md)   This passage
we have already explained. <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md)   The
hardness must have been great indeed which could not be induced to admit
the restoration of wedded love, even though by means of the writing an
opportunity was afforded for advice to be given to this effect by wise
and upright men.  Then the Lord quoted the same law, to show both what
was enjoined on the good and what was permitted to the hard; for, from
what is written of the union of male and female, He proved that a wife
must not be put away, and pointed out the divine authority for the
union; and shows from the same Scriptures that a bill of divorcement was
to be given because of the hardness of the heart, which might be subdued
or might not.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p100"></span><span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxi-Page_252"></span>30.  Since, then, all these excellent
precepts of the Lord, which Faustus tries to prove to be contrary to the
old books of the Hebrews, are found in these very books, the only sense
in which the Lord came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, is
this, that besides the fulfillment of the prophetic types, which are set
aside by their actual accomplishment, the precepts also, in which the
law is holy, and just, and good, are fulfilled in us, not by the oldness
of the letter which commands, and increases the offence of the proud by
the additional guilt of transgression, but by the newness of the Spirit,
who aids us, and by the obedience of the humble, through the saving
grace which sets us free.  For, while all these sublime precepts are
found in the ancient books, still the end to which they point is not
there revealed; although the holy men who foresaw the revelation lived
in accordance with it, either veiling it in prophecy as suited the time,
or themselves discovering the truth thus veiled.

<span id="iv.ix.xxi-p101"></span>31.  I am disposed, after careful
examination, to doubt whether the expression so often used by the Lord,
"the kingdom of heaven," can be found in these books.  It is said,
indeed, "Love wisdom, that ye may reign for ever." <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md)   And if eternal life had not been
clearly made known in the Old Testament, the Lord would not have said,
as He did even to the unbelieving Jews:  "Search the Scriptures, for in
them ye think that ye have eternal life, and they are they that testify
of me." <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md)   And to the same effect
are the words of the Psalmist:  "I shall not die, but live, and declare
the works of the Lord." <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md)   And
again:  "Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death." <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md)   Again, we read, "The souls of the
righteous are in the hand of the Lord, and pain shall not touch them;"
and immediately following:  "They are in peace; and if they have
suffered torture from men, their hope is full of immortality; and after
a few trouble, they shall enjoy many rewards." <span
id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md)   Again, in another place:  "The
righteous shall live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord, and
their concern with the Highest; therefore shall they receive from the
hand of the Lord a kingdom of glory and a crown of beauty." <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md)   These and many similar declarations
of eternal life, in more or less explicit terms, are found in these
writings.  Even the resurrection of the body is spoken of by the
prophets.  The Pharisees, accordingly, were fierce opponents of the
Sadducees, who disbelieved the resurrection.  This we learn not only
from the canonical Acts of the Apostles, which the Manichæans reject,
because it tells of the advent of the Paraclete promised by the Lord,
but also from the Gospel, when the Sadducees question the Lord about the
woman who married seven brothers, one dying after the other, whose wife
she would be in the resurrection. <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md)   As regards, then, eternal life and
the resurrection of the dead, numerous testimonies are to be found in
these Scriptures.  But I do not find there the expression, "the kingdom
of heaven."  This expression belongs properly to the revelation of the
New Testament, because in the resurrection our earthly bodies shall, by
that change which Paul fully describes, become spiritual bodies, and so
heavenly, that thus we may possess the kingdom of heaven.  And this
expression was reserved for Him whose advent as King to govern and
Priest to sanctify His believing people, was ushered in by all the
symbolism of the old covenant, in its genealogies, its typical acts and
words, its sacrifices and ceremonies and feasts, and in all its
prophetic utterances and events and figures.  He came full of grace and
truth, in His grace helping us to obey the precepts, and in His truth
securing the accomplishment of the promises.  He came not to destroy the
law, but to fulfill it.
