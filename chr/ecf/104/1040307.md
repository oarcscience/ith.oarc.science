<span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>13.  By this patience of
Christian love he not only endured the difference of opinion manifested
in all kindliness by his good colleagues on an obscure point, as he also
himself received toleration, till, in process of time, when it so
pleased God, what had always been a most wholesome custom was further
confirmed by a declaration of the truth in a plenary Council, but he
even put up with those who were manifestly bad, as was very well known
to himself, who did not entertain a different view in consequence of the
obscurity of the question, but acted contrary to their preaching in the
evil practices of an abandoned life, as the apostle says of them, "Thou
that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?" <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378)   For Cyprian says in his letter of
such bishops of his own time, his own colleagues, and remaining in
communion with him, "While they had brethren starving in the Church,
they tried to amass large sums of money, they took possession of estates
by fraudulent proceedings, they multiplied their gains by accumulated
usuries." <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379)   For here there is
no obscure question.  Scripture declares openly, "Neither covetous nor
extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God;" <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380) and "He that putteth out his money
to usury," <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381) and "No
whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater,
hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God." <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382)   He therefore certainly would not,
without knowledge, have brought accusations of such covetousness, that
men not only greedily treasured up their own goods, but also
fraudulently appropriated the goods of others, or of idolatry existing
in such enormity as he understands and proves it to exist; nor assuredly
would he bear false witness against his fellow-bishops.  And yet with
the bowels of fatherly and motherly love he endured them, lest that, by
rooting out the tares before their time, the wheat should also have been
rooted up, <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383) imitating
assuredly the Apostle Paul, who, with the same love towards the Church,
endured those who were ill-disposed and envious towards him. <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384)

<span id="v.iv.vi.ix-p9"></span>14.  But yet because "by the envy of the
devil death entered into the world, and they that do hold of his side do
find it," <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385) not because they
are created by God, but because they go astray of themselves, as Cyprian
also says himself, seeing that the devil, before he was a devil, was an
angel, and good, how can it be that they who are of the devil’s side are
in the unity of Christ?  Beyond all doubt, as the Lord Himself says, "an
enemy hath done this," who "sowed tares among the wheat." <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386)   As therefore what is of the devil
within the fold must be convicted, so what is of Christ without must be
recognized.  Has the devil what is his within the unity of the Church,
and shall Christ not have what is His without?  This, perhaps, might be
said of individual men, that as the devil has none that are his among
the holy angels, so God has none that are His outside the communion of
the Church.  But though it may be allowed to the devil to mingle tares,
that is, wicked men, with this Church which still wears the mortal
nature of <span id="page_453">p. 453</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.ix-Page_453"></span>flesh, so long as it is wandering far
from God, he being allowed this just because of the pilgrimage of the
Church herself, that men may desire more ardently the rest of that
country which the angels enjoy, yet this cannot be said of the
sacraments.  For, as the tares within the Church can have and handle
them, though not for salvation, but for the destruction to which they
are destined in the fire, so also can the tares without, which received
them from seceders from within; for they did not lose them by seceding. 
This, indeed, is made plain from the fact that baptism is not conferred
again on their return, when any of the very men who seceded happen to
come back again.  And let not any one say, Why, what fruit hath the
tares?  For if this be so, their condition is the same, so far as this
goes, both inside and without.  For it surely cannot be that grains of
corn are found in the tares inside, and not in those without.  But when
the question is of the sacrament, we do not consider whether the tares
bear any fruit, but whether they have any share of heaven; for the
tares, both within and without, share the rain with the wheat itself,
which rain is in itself heavenly and sweet, even though under its
influence the tares grow up in barrenness.  And so the sacrament,
according to the gospel of Christ, is divine and pleasant; nor is it to
be esteemed as naught because of the barrenness of those on whom its dew
falls even without.
