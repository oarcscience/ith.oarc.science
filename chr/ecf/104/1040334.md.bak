<span id="v.iv.vii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>10.  Now we must see what
is said of the baptism of John.  For "we read in the Acts of the
Apostles, that those who had already been baptized with the baptism of
John were yet baptized by Paul," <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) simply because the baptism of John
was not the baptism of Christ, but a baptism allowed by Christ to John,
so as to be called especially John’s baptism; as the same John says, "A
man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven." <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md)   And that he might not possibly
seem to receive this from God the Father in such wise as not to receive
it from the Son, speaking presently of Christ Himself, he says, "Of His
fullness have all we received." <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md)   But by the grace of a certain
dispensation John received this, which was to last not for long, but
only long enough to prepare for the Lord the way in which he must needs
be the forerunner.  And as our Lord was presently to enter on this way
with all humility, and to lead those who humbly followed Him to
perfection, as He washed the feet of His servants, <span
id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md) so was He willing to be baptized
with the baptism of a servant. <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md)   For as He set Himself to minister
to the feet of those whose guide He was Himself, so He submitted Himself
to the gift of John which He Himself had given, that all might
understand what sacrilegious arrogance they would show in despising the
baptism which they ought each of them to receive from the Lord, when the
Lord Himself accepted what He Himself had bestowed upon a servant, that
he might give it as his own; and that when John, than whom no greater
had arisen among them that are born of women, <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) bore such testimony to Christ, as
to confess that he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His
shoe, <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) Christ might both, by
receiving his baptism, be found to be the humblest among men, and, by
taking away the place for the baptism of John, be believed to be the
most high God, at once the teacher of humility and the giver of
exaltation.

<span id="v.iv.vii.ix-p9"></span>11.  For to none of the prophets, to no
one at all in holy Scripture, do we read that it was granted to baptize
in the water of repentance for the remission of sins, as it was granted
to John; that, causing the hearts of the people to hang upon him through
this marvellous grace, he might prepare in them the way for Him whom he
declared to be so infinitely greater than himself.  But the Lord Jesus
Christ cleanses His Church by such a baptism that on receiving it no
other is required; while John gave a first washing with such a baptism
that on receiving it there was further need of the baptism of the
Lord,—not that the first baptism should be repeated, but that the
baptism of Christ, for whom he was preparing the way, might be further
bestowed on those who had received the baptism of John.  For if Christ’s
humility were not to be commended to our notice, neither would there be
any need of the baptism of John; again, if the end were in John, after
his baptism there would be no need of the baptism of Christ.  But
because "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believeth," <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) it was shown
by John to whom men should go, and in whom, when they had reached Him,
they should rest.  The same, John, therefore, set forth both the exalted
nature of the Lord, when he placed Him far before himself, and His
humility, when he baptized Him as the lowest of the people.  But if John
had baptized Christ alone, he would be thought to have been the
dispenser of a better baptism, in that with which Christ alone was
baptized, than the baptism of Christ with which Christians are baptized;
and again, if all ought to be baptized first with the baptism of John,
and then with that of Christ, the baptism of Christ would deservedly
seem to be lacking in fullness and perfection, as not sufficing for
salvation.  Wherefore the Lord was baptized with the baptism of John,
that He might bend the proud necks of men to His own health-giving
baptism; and He was not alone baptized with it, lest He should <span
id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span id="v.iv.vii.ix-Page_468"></span>show
His own to be inferior to this, with which none but He Himself had
deserved to be baptized; and He did not allow it to continue longer,
lest the one baptism with which He baptizes might seem to need the other
to precede it.
