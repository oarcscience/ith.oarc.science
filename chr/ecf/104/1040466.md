<span id="v.v.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>10.  Again, when he hears,
"He that is washed by one dead, his washing profiteth him nought," <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935) he will answer, "Christ, being
raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over
Him:" <span id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936)   of whom it is said,
"The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost." <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937)   But they are baptized by the
dead, who are baptized in the temples of idols.  For even they
themselves do not suppose that they receive the sanctification which
they look for from their priests, but from their gods; and since these
were men, and are dead in such sort as to be now neither upon earth nor
in the rest of heaven, <span id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938) they
are truly baptized by the dead:  and the same answer will hold good if
there be any other way in which these words of holy Scripture may be
examined, and profitably discussed and understood.  For if in this place
I understand a baptizer who is a sinner, the same absurdity will follow,
that whosoever has been baptized by an ungodly man, even though his
ungodliness be undiscovered, is yet washed in vain, as though <span
id="page_523">p. 523</span> <span
id="v.v.iii.ix-Page_523"></span>baptized by one dead.  For he does not
say, He that is baptized by one manifestly dead, but absolutely, "by one
dead."  And if they consider any man to be dead whom they know to be a
sinner, but any one in their communion to be alive, even though he
manages most adroitly to conceal a life of wickedness, in the first
place with accursed pride they claim more for themselves than they
ascribe to God, that when a sinner is unveiled to them he should be
called dead, but when he is known by God he is held to be alive.  In the
next place, if that sinner is to be called dead who is known to be such
by men, what answer will they make about Optatus, whom they were afraid
to condemn though they had long known his wickedness?  Why are those who
were baptized by him not said to have been baptized by one dead?  Did he
live because the Count was his faith? <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939) —an elegant and well-turned saying
of some early colleagues of their own, which they themselves are wont to
quote with pride, not understanding that at the death of the haughty
Goliath it was his own sword by which his head was cut off. <span

<span id="v.v.iii.ix-p2"></span> So the Donatists commonly quoted
[Ecclus. xxiv. 25](../../../bib/apo/sir024.htm#025)<span
id="v.v.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>, which is more correctly rendered in our
version, "He that washeth himself after touching of a dead body, if he
touch it again, what availeth his washing?"  Augustin (*Retractt*. i.
21, 3) says that the misapplication was rendered possible by the
omission in many African <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.ix-p2.2"></span>Mss.</span> of the second clause, "and
touches it again."  Cp. Hieron, [Ecclus. xxxiv.
