<span id="v.iv.ix.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—</span>26.  Aymnius <span
id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797) of Ausuaga <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798) said:  "We have received one
baptism, which same also we administer; but he who says that authority
is given to heretics also to baptize, the same makes two
baptisms." <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xiv-p5"></span>27.  To him we answer:  Why does not he
also make two baptisms who maintains that the unrighteous also can
baptize?  For although the righteous and unrighteous are in themselves
opposed to one another, yet the baptism which the righteous give, such
as was Paul, or such as was also Cyprian, is not contrary to the baptism
which those unrighteous men were wont to give who hated Paul, whom
Cyprian understands to have been not heretics, but bad Catholics; and
although the moderation which was found in Cyprian, and the covetousness
which was found in his colleagues, are in themselves opposed to one
another, yet the baptism which Cyprian used to give was not contrary to
the baptism which his colleagues who opposed him used to give, but one
and the same with it, because in both cases it is He that baptizes of
whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizeth." <span
