<span id="v.v.iv.ci-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.ci-p1.1"></span>Chapter 101.—</span>229.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.ci-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Inasmuch as we live in the fear of God, we have no fear of the
punishments and executions which you wreak with the sword; but the only
thing which we avoid is that by your most wicked communion you destroy
men’s souls, according to the saying of the Lord Himself: <span
id="page_589">p. 589</span> <span id="v.v.iv.ci-Page_589"></span>‘Fear
not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but
rather fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in
hell.’" <span id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275.md)

<span id="v.v.iv.ci-p3"></span>230.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.ci-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  You do the
destruction which you speak of, not with a visible sword, but with that
of which it is said, "The sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword." <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md)   For with this sword of accusation
and calumny against the world of which you are wholly ignorant, you
destroy the souls of those who lack experience.  But if you find fault
with a most wicked communion, as you term it, I would bid you presently,
not with my words, but with your own, to ascend, descend, enter, turn
yourself about, change sides, be such as was Optatus.  But if you return
to your senses, and shall find that you are not such as he, not because
he refused to partake of the sacraments with you, but because you took
offense at what he did, then you will acquit the world of crimes which
do not belong to it, and you will find yourself involved in the sin of
schism.
