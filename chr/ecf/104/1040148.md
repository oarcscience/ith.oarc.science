<span id="iv.ix.ii-p4"></span>Written about the year 400.  \[Faustus was
undoubtedly the acutest, most determined and most unscrupulous opponent
of orthodox Christianity in the age of Augustin.  The occasion of
Augustin’s great writing against him was the publication of Faustus’
attack on the Old Testament Scriptures, and on the New Testament so far
as it was at variance with Manichæan error.  Faustus seems to have
followed in the footsteps of Adimantus, against whom Augustin had
written some years before, but to have gone considerably beyond
Adimantus in the recklessness of his statements.  The incarnation of
Christ, involving his birth from a woman, is one of the main points of
attack.  He makes the variations in the genealogical records of the
Gospels a ground for rejecting the whole as spurious.  He supposed the
Gospels, in their present form, to be not the works of the Apostles, but
rather of later Judaizing falsifiers.  The entire Old Testament system
he treats with the utmost contempt, blaspheming the Patriarchs, Moses,
the Prophets, etc., on the ground of their private lives and their
teachings.  Most of the objections to the morality of the Old Testament
that are now current were already familiarly used in the time of
Augustin.  Augustin’s answers are only partially satisfactory, owing to
his imperfect view of the relation of the old dispensation to the new;
but in the age in which they were written they were doubtless very
effective.  The writing is interesting from the point of view of
Biblical criticism, as well as from that of polemics against
Manichæism.—A.H.N.\]
