<span id="v.iv.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—</span>29.  But that I may not
seem to be uttering these praises of the blessed martyr (which, indeed,
are not his, but rather those of Him by whose grace he showed himself
what he was), in order to escape the burden of proof, let us now bring
forward from his letters the testimony by which the mouths of the
Donatists may most of all be stopped.  For they advance his authority
before the unlearned, to show that in a manner they do well when they
baptize afresh the faithful who come to them.  Too wretched are
they—and, unless they correct themselves, even by themselves are they
utterly condemned—who choose in the example set them by so great a man
to imitate just that fault, which only did not injure him, because he
walked with constant steps even to the end in that from which they have
strayed who "have not known the way of peace." <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206)   It is true that Christ’s baptism
is holy; and although it may exist among heretics or schismatics, yet it
does not belong to the heresy or schism; and therefore even those who
come from thence to the Catholic Church herself ought not to be baptized
afresh.  Yet to err on this point is one thing; it is another thing that
those who are straying from the peace of the Church, and have fallen
headlong into the pit of schism, should go on to decide that any who
join them ought to be baptized again.  For the former is a speck on the
brightness of a holy soul which abundance of charity <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207) would fain have covered; the latter
is a stain in their nether foulness which the hatred of peace in their
countenance ostentatiously brings to light.  But the subject for our
further consideration, relating to the authority of the blessed Cyprian,
we will commence from a fresh beginning.
