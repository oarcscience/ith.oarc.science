<span id="iv.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Manichæan System.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>Earlier writers on Manichæism have, for
the most part, made the *Acta Disp. Archelai et Manetis* and the
anti-Manichæan writings of Augustin the basis of their representations. 
For later Manichæism in the West, Augustin is beyond question the
highest authority, and the various polemical treatises which he put
forth exhibit the system under almost every imaginable aspect.  The
"Acts of the Disputation of Archelaus and Manes," while it certainly
rests upon a somewhat extensive and accurative knowledge of early
Manichæism, is partially discredited by its generally admitted
spuriousness—spuriousness in the sense that it is not a genuine record
of a real debate.  It is highly probable that debates of this kind
occurred between Mani and various Christian leaders in the East, and so
Mani may at one time or other have given utterance to most of the
statements that are attributed to him in this writing; or these
statements may have been derived, for substance, from his numerous
treatises, and have been artfully adapted to the purposes of the writer
of the "Acts."  It is certain that most of the representations are
correct.  But we can no longer rely upon it as an authentic first-hand
authority.  Since Flügel published the treatise from the *Fihrist*
entitled "The Doctrines of the Manichæans, by Muhammad ben Ishâk," with
a German translation and learned annotations, it has been admitted that
this treatise must be made the basis for all future representations of
Manichæism.  Kessler, while he has had access to many other Oriental
documents bearing upon the subject, agrees with Flügel in giving the
first place to this writing.  On this exposition of the doctrines of the
Manichæans, therefore, as expounded by Flügel and Kessler, we must
chiefly rely.  The highly poetical mythological form which Mani gave to
his speculations renders it exceedingly difficult to <span
id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii-Page_10"></span>arrive at
assured results with reference to fundamental principles.  If we attempt
to state in a plain matter-of-fact way just what Mani taught we are in
constant danger of misrepresenting him.  In fact one of the favorite
methods employed against Mani’s doctrines by the writer of the "Acts of
the Disputation," etc., as well as by Augustin and others, was to reduce
Mani’s poetical fancies to plain language and thus to show their
absurdity.  The considerations which have led experts like Flügel and
Kessler to put so high an estimate upon this document, and the
discussions as to the original language in which the sources of the
document were written, are beyond the scope of this essay.  Suffice it
to say, that so far as we are able to form a judgment on the matter, the
reasons for ascribing antiquity and authenticity to the representation
of Manichæism contained in the document are decisive.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p3"></span>1.  *Mani’s Life*.  According to the
*Fihrist*, Mani’s father, a Persian by race, resided at Coche on the
Tigris, about forty miles north of Babylon.  Afterwards he removed into
Babylonia and settled at Modein, where he frequented an idol-temple like
the rest of the people.  He next became associated with a party named
Mugtasila (Baptizers), probably identical with or closely related to the
Mandæans and Sabeans, both of which parties made much of ceremonial
bathings.  Mani, who was born after the removal to Babylonia, is related
to have been the recipient of angelic visitations at the age of twelve. 
Even at this time he was forewarned that he must leave the religion of
his father at the age of twenty-four.  At the appointed time the angel
At-Taum appeared again and announced to him his mission.  "Hail, Mani,
from me and the Lord, who has sent me to thee and chosen thee for his
mission.  But he commands thee to invite men to thy doctrine and to
proclaim the glad tidings of truth that comes from him, and to bestow
thereon all thy zeal."  Mani entered upon his work, according to
Flügel’s careful computation, April 1, 238, or, according to
calculations based on another statement, in 252.  Mani maintained that
he was the Paraclete promised by Jesus.  He is said, in this document,
to have derived his teaching from the Magi and the Christians, and the
characters in which he wrote his books, from the Syriac and the
Persian.  After travelling in many lands for forty years and
disseminating his doctrines in India, China, and Turkestan, he succeeded
in impressing his views upon Fîrûz, brother of King Sapor, who had
intended to put him to death.  Sapor became warmly attached to Mani and
granted toleration to his followers.  Afterwards, according to some
accounts, Mani was imprisoned by Sapor and liberated by his successor
Hormizd.  He is said to have been crucified by order of King Bahraîm I.
(276-’7), and his skin stuffed with straw is said to have been suspended
at the city gate.  Eusebius (H. E. VII. 31) describes Mani as "a
barbarian in life, both in speech and conduct, who attempted to form
himself into a Christ, and then also proclaimed himself to be the very
Paraclete and the Holy Spirit.  Then, as if he had been Christ, he
selected twelve disciples, the partners of his new religion, and after
patching together false and ungodly doctrines collected from a thousand
heresies long since extinct, he swept them off like a deadly poison from
Persia, upon this part of the world."  The account given in the *Acta
Archel* (written probably about 330-’40), is far more detailed than that
of the *Fihrist* and differs widely therefrom.  It contains much that is
highly improbable.  Mani is represented as having for his predecessors
one Scythianus, an Egyptian heretic of Apostolic times, and Terebinthus,
who went with him to Palestine and after the death of Scythianus removed
to Babylonia.  The writings of Terebinthus or Scythianus came into the
possession of a certain widow, who purchased Mani when seven years of
age (then named Cubricus) and made him heir of her property and books. 
He changed his name to Mani (Manes), and, having become imbued with the
teachings of the books, began at about sixty years of age to promulgate
their teachings, choosing three disciples, Thomas, Addas and Hermas, to
whom he entrusted the writings mentioned above, along with some of his
own.  Up to this time he knew little of Christianity, but having been
imprisoned by the king <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_11"></span>for failure in a promised cure of the
king’s son, he studied the Christian Scriptures and derived therefrom
the idea of the Paraclete, which he henceforth applied to himself. 
After his escape the famous dialogue with Archelaus and that with
Diodorus occurred.  Returning to Arabion he was arrested, carried to
Persia, flayed alive, and his skin stuffed and suspended as above.  Some
additional facts from an Oriental source used by Beausobre have more or
less verisimilitude.  According to this, Mani was born of Magian parents
about 240 <span class="c11"><span id="iv.ii.iii-p3.1"></span>
A.D.</span>  He became skilled in music, mathematics, geography,
astronomy, painting, medicine, and in the Scriptures.  The account of
his ascendancy over Sapor and his subsequent martyrdom is substantially
the same as that of the *Fihrist*.  Albîrunî’s work (see bibliography
preceding) confirms the account given by the *Fihrist*.  The conversion
of Sapor to Manichæism (in <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.iii-p3.2"></span>A.D.</span> 261) is said to be confirmed by
Sassanian inscriptions (see *Journal of Asiat. Soc*. 1868 p. 310-’41,
and ibid. p. 376, and 1871 p. 416).

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p4"></span>The *Fihrist’s* account contains a long
list of the works of Mani, which is supplemented by other Oriental and
Western notices.  The list is interesting as showing the wide range of
Mani’s literary activity, or at least of the literature that was
afterwards connected with his name.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p5"></span>2.  *Mani’s System*.  As the life of Mani
has been the subject of diversified and contradictory representations,
so also have his doctrines.  Here, too, we must make the account given
by the *Fihrist* fundamental.  It will be convenient to treat the
subject under the following heads:  Theology, Cosmogony, Anthropology,
Soteriology, Cultus, Eschatology, and Ethics.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p6"></span>(1.)  *Theology*.  Mani taught *dualism*
in the most unqualified sense.  Zoroastrianism is commonly characterized
as dualistic, yet it is so in no such sense as is Manichæism.  According
to the *Fihrist*, "Mani teaches:  Two subsistences form the beginning of
the world, the one light the other darkness; the two are separated from
each other.  The light is the first most glorious being, limited by no
number, God himself, the King of the Paradise of Light.  He has five
members:  meekness, knowledge, understanding, mystery, insight; and five
other spiritual members:  love, faith, truth, nobleness, and wisdom.  He
maintained furthermore that the God of light, with these his attributes,
is without beginning, but with him two equally eternal things likewise
exist, the one the atmosphere, the other the earth.  Mani adds:  and the
members of the atmosphere are five \[the first series of divine
attributes mentioned above are enumerated\]; and the members of the
earth are five \[the second series\].  The other being is the darkness,
and his members are five:  cloud, burning, hot wind, poison, and
darkness.  Mani teaches:  that the light subsistence borders immediately
on the dark subsistence, without a dividing wall between them; the light
touches with its (lowest) side the darkness, while upwards to the right
and left it is unbounded.  Even so the darkness is endless downwards and
to the right and left."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p7"></span>This represents Mani’s view of the
eternally existent *status quo*, before the conflict began, and the
endless state after the conflict ceases.  What does Mani mean, when he
enumerates two series of five attributes each as members of God, and
straightway postulates the co-eternity of atmosphere and earth and
divides these self-same attributes between the latter?  Doubtless Mani’s
theology was fundamentally pantheistic, *i.e.*, pantheistic within the
limits of each member of the dualism.  The God of Light himself is
apparently conceived of as transcending thought.  Atmosphere and Earth
(not the atmosphere and earth that we know, but ideal atmosphere and
earth) are the æons derived immediately from the Ineffable One and
coëternal with him.  The ten attributes are æons which all belong
primarily to the Supreme Being and secondarily to the two great æons,
half to each.  The question may arise, and has been often discussed,
whether Mani meant to identify God (the Prince of Light) with the
Kingdom of Light?  His language, in this treatise, is wavering.  He
seems to struggle against such a representation, yet without complete
success.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii-Page_12"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p8"></span>What do the other sources teach with
reference to the absoluteness of the dualism and with reference to the
identification of the Prince of Light with the Kingdom of Light? 
According to the *Acts of the Disputation of Archelaus and Manes,* <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) Manes "worships two deities, unoriginated,
self-existent, eternal, opposed the one to the other.  Of them he
represents the one as good, and the other as evil, and assigned the name
of *Light* to the former, and that of *Darkness* to the latter."  Again,
Manes is represented as saying:  "I hold that there are two natures, one
good and another evil; and that the one which is good dwells in a
certain part proper to it, but that the evil one is this world as well
as all things in it, which are placed there like objects imprisoned in
the portion of the wicked one" ([1 John
5.19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p9.1"></span>).  According to Alexander of
Lycopolis, <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) "Mani laid down two
principles, God and matter (*Hyle*).  God he called good, and matter he
affirmed to be evil.  But God excelled more in good than matter in
evil."  Alexander goes on to show how Mani used the word *Hyle*,
comparing the Manichæan with the Platonic teaching.  Statements of
substantially the same purport might be multiplied.  As regards the
identification of God (the King of Light) with the Kingdom of Light, and
of Satan (the King of Darkness) with the Kingdom of Darkness, the
sensuous poetical way in which Mani expressed his doctrines may leave us
in doubt.  The probability is, however, that he did pantheistically
identify each element of the dualism with his Kingdom.  He personifies
the Kingdom of Light and the Kingdom of Darkness, and peoples these
Kingdoms with fanciful beings, which are to be regarded as personified
attributes of the principles of darkness and light.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p11"></span>A word on the Manichæan conception of
matter or *Hyle* may not be out of place in this connection.  It would
seem that the Manichæans practically identified *Hyle* or matter with
the Kingdom of Darkness.  At any rate *Hyle* is unoriginated and belongs
wholly to this Kingdom.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p12"></span>(2.)  *Cosmogony*.  So much for the
Manichæan idea of the Kingdom of Light and the Kingdom of Darkness
before the great conflict that resulted in the present order of things. 
Why did not they remain separate?  Let us learn from the *Fihrist’s*
narrative:  "Mani teaches further:  Out of this dark earth \[the Kingdom
of Darkness\] arose Satan, not that he was in himself eternal from the
beginning, yet were his substances in his elements unoriginated.  These
substances now united themselves out of his elements and went forth as
Satan, his head as the head of a lion, his body as the body of a dragon,
his wings as the wings of a bird, his tail as the tail of a great fish,
and his four feet as the feet of creeping animals.  When this Satan
under the name Iblis, the (temporally considered) eternal (primeval),
had arisen out of the darkness, he devoured and consumed everything,
spread destruction right and left, and plunged into the deep, in all
these movements bringing down from above desolation and annihilation. 
Then he strove for the height, and descried the beams of light; but they
were opposed to him.  When he saw later how exalted these were, he was
terrified, shrivelled up, and merged himself in his elements.  Hereupon
he strove anew with such violence after the height, that the land of
light descried the doings of Satan and how he was bent upon murder and
destruction.  After they had been apprised thereof, the world of Insight
learned of it, then the world of Knowledge, then the world of Mystery,
then the world of Understanding, then the world of Meekness.  When at
last, he further teaches, the King of the Paradise of Light had also
learned of it, he thought how he might suppress Satan, and, Mani adds,
those hosts of his would have been mighty enough to overpower Satan. 
Yet he desired to do this by means of his own might.  Accordingly, he
produced by means of the spirit of his right hand \[*i.e.*, the Gentle
Breeze\], his five worlds, and his twelve elements, a creature, and this
is the (temporally considered) Eternal Man <span id="page_13">p.
13</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii-Page_13"></span> \[Primordial Man\], and
summoned him to do battle with the Darkness.  But Primordial Man, Mani
adds, armed himself with the five races \[natures\], and these are the
five gods, the Gentle Breeze, the Wind, the Light, the Water and the
Fire.  Of them he made his armor, and the first that he put on was the
Gentle Breeze.  He then covered the Gentle Breeze with the burning Light
as with a mantle.  He drew over the Light Water filled with atoms, and
covered himself with the blowing Wind.  Hereupon he took the Fire as a
shield and as a lance in his hand, and precipitated himself suddenly out
of Paradise until he reached the border of the region that is contiguous
to the battle-field.  The Primordial Devil also took his five races
\[natures\]:  Smoke, Burning, Darkness, Hot Wind and Cloud; armed
himself with them; made of them a shield for himself; and went to meet
Primordial Man.  After they had fought for a long time the Primordial
Devil vanquished the Primordial Man, devoured some of his light, and
surrounded him at the same time with his races and elements.  Then the
King of the Paradise of Light sent other gods, freed him, and vanquished
the Darkness.  But he who was sent by the King of Light to rescue
Primordial Man is called the Friend of the Light.  This one made a
precipitate descent, and Primordial Man was freed from the hellish
substances, along with that which he had snatched from the spirit of
Darkness and which had adhered to him.  When, therefore, Mani proceeds,
Joyfulness and the Spirit of Life drew near to the border, they looked
down into the abyss of this deep hell and saw Primordial Man and the
angels \[*i.e.*, the races or natures with which he was armed\], how
Iblis, the Proud Oppressors, and the Dark Life surrounded them.  And the
Spirit of Life, says Mani, called Primordial Man with a loud voice as
quick as lightning and Primordial Man became another god.  When the
Primordial Devil had ensnared Primordial Man in the battle, Mani further
teaches, the five parts of the Light were mingled with the five parts of
the Darkness."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p13"></span>Let us see if we can get at the meaning
of this great cosmological poem as far as we have gone.  The thing to be
accounted for is the mixture of good and evil.  The complete separation
of the eternally existent Kingdoms of Light and Darkness has been
posited.  How now are we to account for the mixture of light and
darkness, of good and evil, in the present order of things?  Mani would
account for it by supposing that a conflict had occurred between an
insufficiently equipped representative of the King of Light and the
fully equipped ruler of the Kingdom of Darkness.  His view of the vastly
superior power of the King of Light would not allow him to suppose that
the King of Light fully equipped had personally contended with the King
of Darkness, and suffered the loss and contamination of his elements. 
Yet he only clumsily obviates this difficulty; for Primordial Man is
produced and equipped by the King of Light for the very purpose of
combating the King of Darkness, and Mani saves the King of Light from
personal contamination only by impugning his judgment.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p14"></span>We have now reached the point where, as
a result of the conflict, good and evil are blended.  We must beware of
supposing that Mani meant to ascribe any kind of materiality to the
members of the Kingdom of Light.  The Kingdom of Light, on the contrary,
he regarded as purely spiritual; the Kingdom of Darkness as material. 
We have now the conditions for the creation of the present order of
things, including man.  How does Mani picture the process and the
results of this mixing of the elements?

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p15"></span>"The smoke (or vapor) was mingled with
the gentle breeze (zephyr), and the present atmosphere resulted.  So
that whatever of agreeableness and power to quicken the soul and animal
life is found in it \[resultant air\], is from the zephyr, and whatever
of destructiveness and noisomeness is found in it, proceeds from the
smoke.  The burning was mingled with the fire; therefore whatever of
conflagration, destruction and ruin is found, is from the burning, but
whatever of brightness and illumination is in it \[the resultant fire\],
springs <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_14"></span>from the fire.  The light mingled itself
with the darkness; therefore in dense bodies as gold, silver and the
like, whatever of brightness, beauty, purity and other useful qualities
occurs, is from the light, and whatever of tarnish, impurity, density
and hardness occurs, springs from the darkness.  The hot wind was
mingled with the wind; whatever now is useful and agreeable in this
\[resultant wind\] springs from the wind, and whatever of uneasiness,
hurtfulness and deleterious property is found in it \[resultant wind\]
is from the hot wind.  Finally, the mist was mingled with the water, so
that what is found in this \[resultant water\] of clearness, sweetness,
and soul-satisfying property, is from the water; whatever, on the
contrary, of overwhelming, suffocating, and destroying power, of
heaviness, and corruption, is found in it, springs from the mist."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p16"></span>But we must from this point abbreviate
the somewhat prolix account.  Primordial Man, after the blending of the
elements, ascended on high accompanied by "one of the angels of this
intermingling;" in other words, snatching away a part of the imprisoned
elements of the Kingdom of Light.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p17"></span>The next step is the creation of the
present world, which Mani ascribes to the King of the World of Light,
the object being to provide for the escape of the imprisoned elements of
Light.  Through an angel he constructed ten heavens and eight earths, an
angel being appointed to hold heavens and earths in their places.  A
description of the stairways, doors, and halls of the heavens is given
in the *Fihrist’s* narrative.  The stairways lead to the "height of
heaven."  The air was used as a medium for connecting heaven and earth. 
A pit was formed to be the receptacle of darkness from which the light
should be liberated.  The sun and the moon were created to be the
receptacles of the light that should be liberated from the darkness, the
sun for light that has been mingled with "hot devils," the moon for that
which had been mingled with "cold devils."  The moon is represented as
collecting light during the first half-month, and during the second
pouring it into the sun.  When the sun and moon have liberated all the
light they are able, there will be a fire kindled on the earth which
will burn for 1468 years, when there will be no light left.  The King of
Darkness and his hosts will thereupon withdraw into the pit prepared for
them.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p18"></span>(3.)  *Anthropology*.  So much for the
liberation of the imprisoned light, which, according to Mani, was the
sole object of creation.  As yet we have heard nothing of the creation
of living creatures.  What place do man, the lower animals, and plants
sustain in the Manichæan economy?  We are to keep constantly in mind
that Primordial Man was not Adam, but a divine æon, and that he ascended
into the heights immediately after the blending of parts of his armor
with darkness.  The creation of earthly man was an altogether different
affair.  We must give the account of man’s creation in Mani’s own words,
as preserved by the *Fihrist*:  "Hereupon one of those Arch-fiends and
\[one\] of the Stars, and Overmastering Violence, Avarice, Lust, and
Sin, copulated, and from their copulation sprang the first man, who is
Adam, two Arch-fiends, a male and a female, directing the process.  A
second copulation followed and from this sprang the beautiful woman who
is Eve."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p19"></span>Man, therefore, unlike the world, is the
creature of demons, the aim of the demons being to imprison in man,
through the propagation of the race, as much as possible of the light,
and so to hinder the separating process by the sun and the moon. 
Avarice is represented as having secretly seized some of the divine
light and imprisoned it in man.  The part played by the Star in the
production of man is somewhat obscure in the narrative, yet the Star
could hardly have been regarded as wholly evil.  Probably the Star was
thought of as a detached portion of the light that had not entered into
the sun or the moon.  "When, therefore, the five Angels saw what had
taken place, they besought the Messenger of Joyful Knowledge, the Mother
of Life, Primordial Man and the Spirit of Life, to send some one to
liberate and save man, to reveal to him knowledge and righteousness, and
to free <span id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_15"></span>him from the power of the devils.  They
sent, accordingly, Jesus, whom a god accompanied.  These seized the two
Arch-fiends, imprisoned them and freed the two creatures (Adam and
Eve.)"

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p20"></span>Jesus warned Adam of Eve’s violent
importunity, and Adam obeyed his injunction not to go near her.  One of
the Arch-fiends, however, begat with her a son named Cain, who in turn
begat Abel of his mother, and afterwards two maidens Worldly wise and
Daughter-of-Avarice.  Cain took the first to wife and gave the other to
Abel.  An angel having begotten of Worldly-wise two beautiful daughters
(Raufarjâd and Barfarjâd), Abel accused Cain of the act.  Cain enraged
by the false accusation slew Abel and took Worldly-wise to wife.  So far
Adam had kept himself pure, but Eve was instructed by a demon in the art
of enchanting, and she was enabled to excite his lust and to entrap
him.  By Adam she bore a beautiful son, whom the demon urged Eve to
destroy.  Adam stole the child away and brought it up on cow’s milk and
fruit.  This son was named Seth (*Schatil*).  Adam once more yielded to
Eve’s fascinations, but through Seth’s exhortations was induced to flee
"eastward to the light and the wisdom of God."  Adam, Seth, Raufarjâd,
Barfarjâd, and Worldly-wise died and went to Paradise; while Eve, Cain,
and Daughter-of-Avarice went into Hell.  This fantastic perversion of
the Biblical narrative of the creation and fall of man has many
parallels in Rabbinic literature, and doubtless Mani first became
acquainted with the narrative in a corrupted form.  The teaching,
however, of this mythologizing evidently is that the indulgence of the
flesh and the begetting of children furnish the chief obstacle to the
separation of light from darkness.  Adam is represented as striving to
escape from the allurements of Eve, but Eve is aided by demonic craft in
overcoming him.  Yet Adam does not become enslaved to lust, and so at
last is saved.  Eve, lustful from the beginning, is lost along with
those of like disposition.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p21"></span>(4.)  *Soteriology*.  Such was,
apparently, Mani’s conception of the creation of man, and of the
attempts to liberate the light that was in him.  What were his practical
teachings to men of his time as to the means of escape from the Kingdom
of Darkness into the Kingdom of Light?  What view did Mani take of the
historical Jesus?  The Jesus who warned Adam against the seductions of
Eve was evidently not the Jesus of the New Testament.  According to the
narrative of the *Fihrist*, Mani "maintained that Jesus is a devil." 
Such a statement occurs nowhere else, so far as we are aware, in the
literature of Manichæism.  The sources, however, are unanimous in
ascribing to Mani a completely docetical view of the person of Christ. 
In using this blasphemous language, he probably referred to the
representations of Jesus as God manifest in the flesh, which he regarded
as Jewish and abominable.  The New Testament narratives Mani \[or at
least his followers\] regarded as interpolated in the interest of
Judaism.  Later Manichæans, under the influence of Marcionism (and
orthodoxy) gave to Jesus a far more prominent place in the economy of
man’s salvation than did Mani himself.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p22"></span>How then is man to be saved according to
Mani?  It is by rigorous asceticism, and by the practice of certain
ceremonial observances.  Mani does not rise above the plane of ordinary
heathenism in his plan of salvation.  "It is incumbent upon him who will
enter into the religion that he prove himself, and that if he sees that
he is able to subdue lust and avarice, to leave off the eating of all
kinds of flesh, the drinking of wine, and connubial intercourse, and to
withhold himself from what is injurious in water, fire, magic and
hypocrisy, he may enter into the religion; but if not let him abstain
from entering.  But if he loves religion, yet is not able to repress
sensuality and avarice, yet he may make himself serviceable for the
maintenance of religion and of the Truthful \[*i.e.* the ‘Elect’\], and
may meet (offset) his corrupt deeds through the use of opportunities
where he wholly gives himself up to activity, righteousness, zealous
watchfulness, prayer and pious humiliation; for this suf<span
id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii-Page_16"></span>fices him
in this transitory world and in the future eternal world, and his form
in the last day will be the second form, of which, God willing, we shall
treat further below."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p23"></span>The doctrine of indulgences of which the
germs appeared in the Catholic church even before the time of Mani, is
here seen fully developed.  What the Greek and Latin sources call the
*Elect* or *Perfect* and the *Hearers*, are undoubtedly indicated here
by those who are able to devote themselves to rigidly ascetical living,
and those who, without such qualifications, are willing to exert
themselves fully on behalf of the cause.  These latter evidently become
partakers of the merits of those who carry out the ascetical
regulations.  That this is primitive Manichæan doctrine is abundantly
proved by the general agreement of ancient writers of all classes.  It
is noteworthy that nothing Christian appears among the conditions of
Manichæan discipleship.  It is not faith in Christ, but the ability to
follow a particular kind of outward life that confers standing in the
Manichæan society.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p24"></span>(5.)  *Cultus*.  Let us next look at the
precepts of Mani to the initiated:  "Mani imposed upon his disciples
commandments, namely, ten commandments, and to these are attached three
seals, and fasts of seven days in each month.  The commandments are: 
Faith in the four most glorious essences:  God, his Light, his Power,
and his Wisdom.  But God, whose name is glorious, is the King of the
Paradise of Light; his Light is the sun and the moon, his Power the five
angels:  Gentle Breeze, Wind, Light, Water and Fire; and his Wisdom the
Sacred Religion.  This embraces five ideas:  that of teachers, the sons
of Meekness; that of those enlightened by the Sun, sons of Knowledge;
that of the presbyters, sons of Reason; that of the Truthful, sons of
Mystery; that of Hearers, sons of Insight.  The ten commandments are: 
Abandoning of prayer to idols, of lies, avarice, murder, adultery,
theft, of the teaching of jugglery and magic, of duplicity of mind,
which betrays doubt on religion, of drowsiness and inertness in
business; and the commandment of four or seven prayers.  In prayer one
is to stand upright, rub himself with flowing water or with something
else, and turn while standing to the great light (the Sun), then
prostrate himself and in this position pray:  Blessed be our Leader, the
Paraclete, the Ambassador of the Light, blessed be his angels, the
Guardians, and highly praised be his resplendent hosts.… In the second
prostration let him say:  Thou highly praised, O thou enlightening one,
Mani, our Leader, thou root of enlightenment, stem of honorableness,
thou great tree who art altogether the means of salvation.  In the third
prostration let him say:  I fall down and praise with pure heart and
upright tongue the great God, the Father of Light, and their element,
highly praised, Blessed One, thou and thy whole glory and thy blessed
world, which thou hast called into being.  For he praises thee who
praises thy Host, thy Righteous Ones, thy Word, thy Glory, and thy Good
Pleasure, because thou art the God who is wholly truth, life and
righteousness.  In the fourth prostration let him say:  I praise and
fall down before all the gods, all the enlightening angels, before all
Light and all Hosts, who are from the great God.  In the fifth
prostration let him say:  I fall down and praise the great Host and the
enlightening Gods, who with their wisdom assail the Darkness, drive it
out and triumph over it.  In the sixth prostration let him say:  I fall
down and praise the Father of Glory, the Exalted One, the Enlightening
One, who has come forth from the two sciences (see note in Flügel p.
310), and so on to the twelfth prostration. \* \* The first prayer is
accomplished at mid-day, the second between this hour and sunset; then
follows the prayer at eventide, after sunset, and hereupon the prayer in
the first quarter of the night, three hours after sunset.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p25"></span>"As regards fasting, when the sun is in
*Sagittarius*, and the moon has its full light, fasting is to take place
for two days without interruption, also when the new moon begins to
appear; likewise when the moon first becomes visible again after the sun
has entered into the sign of *Capricorn*; then when the new moon begins
to appear, the sun stands in *Aquarius* <span id="page_17">p. 17</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iii-Page_17"></span>and from the moon eight days have
flowed, a fast of thirty days occurs, broken, however, daily at sunset. 
The common Manichæans celebrate Sunday, the consecrated ones (the
‘Elect’) Monday."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p26"></span>Here we have a somewhat detailed account
of the cultus of the early Manichæans.  The forms of invocation do not
differ materially from those of the Zoroastrians, of the early Indians,
of the Babylonians, and of the Egyptians.  There is not the slightest
evidence of Christian influence.  The times of worship and of fasting
are determined by the sun and the moon, and practically these are the
principal objects of worship.  It is certain that Mani himself was
regarded by his followers as the most perfect revealer of God that had
ever appeared among men, and, according to this account, he taught his
followers to worship him.  We cannot fail to see in this Manichæan cult
the old Oriental pantheism modified by a dualism, of which the most
fully developed form was the Persian, but which, as we have seen, was by
no means confined to Zoroastrianism.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p27"></span>(6.)  *Eschatology*.  We must conclude
our exposition of the doctrines of the Manichæans by quoting from the
*Fihrist* Mani’s teachings on eschatology.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p28"></span>"When death approaches a Truthful One
(‘Elect’), teaches Mani, Primordial Man sends a Light-God in the form of
a guiding Wise One, and with him three gods, and along with these the
water-vessel, clothing, head-gear, crown, and garland of light.  With
them comes the maiden, like the soul of this Truthful One.  There
appears to him also the devil of avarice and lust, along with other
devils.  As soon as the Truthful Man sees these he calls the goddess who
has assumed the form of the Wise One and the three other gods to his
help, and they draw near him.  As soon as the devils are aware of their
presence they turn and flee.  The former, however, take this Truthful
One, clothe him with the crown, the garland and the robe, put the
water-vessel in his hand and mount with him upon the pillars of promise
to the sphere of the moon, to Primordial Man, and to Nahnaha, the Mother
of the Living, to the position in which he was at first in the Paradise
of Light.  But his body remains lying as before in order that the sun,
the moon, and the gods of Light may withdraw from it the powers, *i.e.*,
the water, the fire and the gentle breeze, and he rises to the sun and
becomes a god.  But the rest of his body, which is wholly darkness, is
cast into hell."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p29"></span>In the case of Manichæans of the lower
order, described above, the same divine personages appear at his
summons.  "They free him also from devils, but he ceases not to be like
a man in the world, who in his dreams sees frightful forms and sinks
into filth and mire.  In this condition he remains, until his light and
his spirit are liberated and he has attained to the place of union with
the Truthful, and after a long period of wandering to and fro puts on
their garments."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p30"></span>To the sinful man, on the other hand,
the divine personages appear, not to free him from the devils that are
tormenting him, but rather to "overwhelm him with reproaches, to remind
him of his deeds, and strikingly to convince him that he has renounced
help for himself, from the side of the Truthful.  Then wanders he round
about in the world, unceasingly chased by torments, until this order of
things ceases, and along with the world he is cast into hell."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p31"></span>There is nothing original about the
eschatology of Mani, and scarcely anything Christian.  We see in it a
fully developed doctrine of purgatory, somewhat like the Platonic, and
still more like that of the later Catholic church.  Salvation consists
simply in the liberation of the light from the darkness.  In the case of
the Elect this takes place immediately after death; in the case of
adherents who have not practiced the prescribed forms of asceticism, it
takes place only after considerable torment.  In the case of the
ordinary sensual man, there is no deliverance.  Doubtless Mani would
have held that in his case, too, <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_18"></span>whatever particles of light may have been
involved in his animal structure are liberated from the dead body.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p32"></span>(7.)  *Ethics*.  As regards ceremonies
we find little that enlightens us in the *Fihrist’s* account.  Water
(that is, water apart from the deleterious elements that have become
blended with it) was regarded by Mani as one of the divine elements. 
The ablutions in running water mentioned above in connection with the
prayers may have sustained some relation to baptism, but can hardly be
ascribed to Christian influence.  The connection of the Manichæans with
the Mandæans, who made much of ceremonial bathing, will be considered
below.  It is certain that Mani’s father was connected with a baptizing
party, *viz.*, the Mugtasilah.  According to the *Fihrist* Mani was the
author of an Epistle on Baptism.  The question whether Mani and his
followers practised water-baptism or not is by no means an easy one to
solve.  The passage cited by Giesseler from Augustin to prove that the
"Elect" were initiated by baptism is inconclusive.  Augustin
acknowledges that God and the Manichæans themselves alone know what
takes place in the secret meetings of the "Elect."  Whatever ceremonies
they performed, whether baptism or the Lord’s supper, or some other,
were matters of profound secrecy, and so we need not wonder at the lack
of definite information.  From a passage quoted by Augustin in his
report of a discussion with Felix the Manichæan, we should certainly
infer that both ordinances were practised in some form by the Manichæans
of the West.  But Augustin himself says that Manichæans deny the saving
efficacy of baptism, maintain that it is superfluous, do not require it
of those whom they win to their views, etc.  It is certain, therefore,
that if they practised baptism and the Lord’s supper at all, they
attached to it a meaning radically different from that of Augustin.  It
is possible that a ceremonial anointing with oil took the place of
baptism.  (<span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.iii-p32.1"></span>Baur</span>, p. 277 sq.).  Augustin mentions
a disgusting ceremony in which human semen was partaken of by the Elect
in order to deliver the imprisoned light contained therein (*De Haeres*.
46), and he calls this ceremony a sort of Eucharist.  But his confessed
ignorance of the doings of the "Elect" discredits in some measure this
accusation.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p33"></span>The *Fihrist* gives us no definite
information about the three *signacula*.  The seals (not signs) of the
mouth, the hand (or hands), and of the bosom.  In these are contained
symbolically the Manichæan moral system.  In the book *Sadder* (<span
class="c11"><span id="iv.ii.iii-p33.1"></span>Hyde</span>, p. 492) we
read:  "It is taught \[by the Manichæans\] to abstain from every sin, to
eliminate every sin from hand, and tongue and thought."  Augustin
explains the *signacula* more fully and represents the Manichæans as
attaching great importance to them:  "When I name the mouth, I mean all
the senses that are in the head; when I name the hand I mean every
operation; when I name the bosom I mean every seminal lust."

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p34"></span>It is confidently believed that the
foregoing account of the Manichæan system, based upon the Arabic
narratives preserved by the *Fihrist*, supplemented by the principal
Eastern and Western sources, contains the essential facts with reference
to this strange system of religious thought.  Our next task will to be
to ascertain, as precisely as possible, the relations that Manichæism
sustained to the various religious systems with which it has commonly
been associated.
