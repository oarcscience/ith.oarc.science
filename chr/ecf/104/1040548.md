<span id="v.v.iv.lxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> 61.—137.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But the Lord Christ says, ‘Whosoever shall do and teach them, the same
shall be called the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.’  But He condemns
you wretched men as follows:  ‘Whosoever shall break one of these
commandments, he shalt be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.’"

<span id="v.v.iv.lxi-p2"></span>138.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxi-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  When you happen
to quote the testimony of Scripture as other than it really is, and it
does not bear on the question which is at issue between us, I am not
greatly concerned; but when it interferes with the matter on hand,
unless it is quoted truly, then I think that you have no right to find
fault if I remind you how the passage really stands.  For you must be
aware that the verse which you quoted is not as you quoted it, but
rather thus:  "Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called
great in the kingdom of heaven."  And immediately He continues, "For I
say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
into the kingdom of heaven." <span id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153.md)
  For elsewhere He shows and proves of the Pharisees that they say and
do not.  It is these, therefore, to whom He is referring also here, when
He said, "Whosoever shall break one of these commandments, and shall
teach men so,"—that is, shall teach in words what he has violated in
deeds; whose righteousness He says that our righteousness must excel, in
that we must both keep the commandments and teach men so.  And yet not
even on account of those Pharisees, with whom you compare us,—not from
any motives of prudence, but from malice,—did our Lord enjoin that the
seat of Moses should be deserted, which seat He doubtless meant to be a
figure of His own; for He said indeed that they who sat in Moses’ seat
were ever saying and not doing, but warns the people to do what they
say, and not to do what they do, <span
id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154.md) lest the chair, with all its
holiness, should be deserted, and the unity of the flock divided through
the faithlessness of the shepherds.
