id="iv.x.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Measure in Some Sense is Suitable
to God Himself.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxiv-p2"></span>But God cannot be said to have measure,
lest He should seem to be spoken of as limited.  Yet He is not
immoderate by whom measure is bestowed upon all things, so that they may
in any measure exist.  Nor again ought God to be called measured, as if
He received measure from any one.  But if we say that He is the highest
measure, by chance we say something; if indeed in speaking of the
highest measure we mean the highest good.  For every measure in so far
as it is a measure is good; whence nothing can be called measured,
modest, modified, without praise, although in another sense we use
measure for limit, and speak of no measure where there is no limit,
which is sometimes said with praise as when it is said:  "And of His
kingdom there shall be no limit." <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094)   For it might also be said, "There
shall be no measure," so that measure might be used in the sense of
limit; for He who reigns in no measure, assuredly does not reign at all.
