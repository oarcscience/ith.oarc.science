<span id="v.iv.viii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—</span>15.  To the declaration
of Polycarp of Adrumetum, <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md)
that "those who declare the baptism of heretics to be valid, make ours
of none effect," we answer, if that is the baptism of heretics which is
given by heretics, then that is the baptism of the covetous and
murderers which is given by them within the Church.  But if this be not
their baptism, neither is the other the baptism of heretics; and so it
is Christ’s, by whomsoever it be given.

<span id="v.iv.viii.x-p2"></span> Adrumetum (Hadrumetum) was an ancient
Phœnician settlement, made a Roman colony by Trajan, on the coast of the
Sinus Neapolitanus, some ninety miles south-east of Carthage, capital of
Byzacium.  Cyprian writes to Bp. Cornelius, Ep. xlviii.<span
id="v.iv.viii.x-p2.1"></span>, vindicating Polycarp:  his name occurs
also in the titles of Cypr. Epp. lvii., lxvii. (after Primus), and lxx.
(after Cæcilius).
