<span id="v.v.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—</span>49.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"It may be urged that Christ said to His apostles, as you are constantly
quoting against us, ‘He that is washed needeth not save to wash his
feet, but is clean every whit.’  Now if you discuss those words in all
their fullness, you are bound by what immediately follows.  For this is
what He said, in His very words:  ‘He that is washed needeth not save to
wash his feet, but is clean every whit:  and ye are clean, but not all. 
But this he said on account of Judas, who should betray Him; therefore
said He, Ye are not all clean.’ <span
id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md)   Whosoever, therefore, has
incurred the guilt of treason, has forfeited, like you, his baptism. 
Again, after that the betrayer of Christ had himself been condemned, He
thus more fully confirmed His words to the eleven apostles:  ‘Now are ye
clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.  Abide in me, and I
in you.’ <span id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md)   And again He said
to these same eleven, ‘Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto
you.’ <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md)   Seeing, then, that
these things were said to the eleven apostles, when the traitor, as we
have seen, had been condemned, you likewise, being *traditors*, are
similarly without both peace and baptism."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxii-p5"></span>50.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxii-p5.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  If therefore
every *traditor* has forfeited his baptism, it will follow that every
one who, having been baptized by you, has afterwards become a
*traditor*, ought to be baptized afresh.  And if you do not do this, you
yourselves sufficiently prove the falseness of the saying, "Whosoever
therefore has incurred the guilt of treason, has forfeited, like you,
his baptism."  For if he has forfeited it, let him return and receive it
again; but if he returns and does not receive it, it is clear that he
had not forfeited it.  Again, if the reason why it was said to the
apostles, "Now are ye clean," and "My peace I give unto you," was that
the traitor had already left the room, then was not that supper of so
great a sacrament clean and able to give peace, which He distributed to
all before his going out?  And if you venture to say this with your eyes
closed against the truth, what can we do save exclaim the more, See how
blindness comes in punishment of the madness of those who wish to be, as
the apostle says, "teachers of the law, understanding neither what they
say, nor whereof they affirm?" <span
id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md)   And yet, unless blindness came in
the way of their pertinacity, it was not a very difficult matter that
you should understand and see that the Lord did not say in the presence
of Judas, Ye are not yet clean, but "Now are ye clean."  He added,
however, "But not all," because there was one there who was not clean;
yet if he had been polluting the others by his presence, it would not
have been declared to them, "Now are ye clean," but, as I said before,
Ye are not yet clean.  But, after Judas had gone out, He said to them,
"Now are ye clean," and did not add the words, But not all, because he
had now departed in whose presence indeed, as had been said to them,
they were already clean, but not all, because there was one there
unclean.  Wherefore in these words the Lord rather declared that in the
one company of men receiving the same sacraments, the uncleanness of
some members cannot hurt the clean.  Certainly, if you think that there
are among us men like Judas, you might apply to us the words, "Ye are
clean, but not all."  But this is not what you say; but you say that
because of the presence of some who are unclean, therefore we are all
unclean.  This the Lord did not say to the disciples in the presence of
Judas, and therefore whoever says this has not learned from the good
Master what He says.
