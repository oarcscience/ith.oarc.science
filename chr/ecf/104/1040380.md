<span id="v.iv.viii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—</span>49.  Privatianus of
Sufetula <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686) said:  "He who says
that heretics have the power of baptizing should first say who it was
that founded heresy.  For if heresy is of God, it may have the divine
favor; but if it be not of God, how can it either have or confer on any
one the grace of God?" <span id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxvi-p4"></span>50.  This man may thus be answered
word <span id="page_492">p. 492</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xxvi-Page_492"></span>for word:  He who says that
malicious and envious persons have the power of baptizing, should first
say who was the founder of malice and envy.  For if malice and envy are
of God, they may have the divine favor; but if they are not of God, how
can they either have or confer on any one the grace of God?  But as
these words are in the same way most manifestly false, so are also those
which these were uttered to confute.  For the malicious and envious
baptize, as even Cyprian himself allows, because he bears testimony that
they also are within.  So therefore even heretics may baptize, because
baptism is the sacrament of Christ; but envy and heresy are the works of
the devil.  Yet though a man possesses them, he does not thereby cause
that if he have the sacrament of Christ, it also should itself be
reckoned in the number of the devil’s works.
