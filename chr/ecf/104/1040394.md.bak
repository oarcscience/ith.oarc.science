<span id="v.iv.viii.xl"></span>

<span id="v.iv.viii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—</span>77.  Also another Felix
of Ammacura <span id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) said:  "I too,
following the authority of the holy Scriptures, give my judgment that
heretics should be baptized, and with them those also who maintain that
they have been baptized among schismatics.  For if, according to the
warning of Christ, our fountain is sealed to ourselves, <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md) let all the enemies of our Church
understand that it cannot belong to others; nor can He who is the
Shepherd of our flock give the water unto salvation to two different
peoples.  And therefore it is clear that neither heretics nor
schismatics can receive anything heavenly, who dare to accept from men
that are sinners and aliens from the Church.  When the giver has no
ground to stand upon, surely neither can the receiver derive any
profit." <span id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xl-p5"></span>78.  To him we answer, that the holy
Scriptures nowhere have enjoined that heretics baptized among heretics
should be baptized afresh, but that they have shown in many places that
all are aliens from the Church who are not on the rock, nor belong to
the members of the dove, and yet that they baptize and are baptized and
have the sacrament of salvation without salvation.  But how our fountain
is like the fountain of Paradise, in that, like it, it flows forth even
beyond the bounds of Paradise, has been sufficiently set forth
above; <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) and that "He who is
the Shepherd of our flock cannot give the water unto salvation to two
different peoples," that is, to one that is His own, and to another that
is alien, I fully agree in admitting.  But does it follow that because
the water is not unto salvation it is not the identical water?  For the
water of the deluge was for salvation unto those who were placed within
the ark, but it brought death to those without, and yet it was the same
water.  And many aliens, that is to say, envious persons, whom Cyprian
declares and proves from Scripture to be of the party of the devil, seem
as it were to be within, and yet, if they were not without the ark, they
would not perish by water.  For such men are slain by baptism, as the
sweet savor of Christ was unto death to those of whom the apostle
speaks. <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md)   Why then do not
either heretics or schismatics receive anything heavenly, just as thorns
or tares, like those who were without the ark received indeed the rain
from the floods of heaven, but to destruction, not to salvation?  And so
I do not take the pains to refute what he said in conclusion:  "When the
giver has no ground to stand upon, surely neither can the receiver
derive <span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xl-Page_497"></span>any profit," since we also say that it
does not profit the receivers while they receive it in heresy,
consenting with the heretics; and therefore they come to Catholic peace
and unity, not that they may receive baptism, but that what they had
received may begin to profit them.
