<span id="v.iv.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—</span>5.  Wherefore the holy
Cyprian, whose dignity is only increased by his humility, who so loved
the pattern set by Peter as to use the words, "Giving us thereby a
pattern of concord and patience, that we should not pertinaciously love
our own opinions, but should rather account as our own any true and
rightful suggestions of our brethren and colleagues, for the common
health and weal," <span id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) —he, I say,
abundantly shows that he was most willing to correct his own opinion, if
any one should prove to him that it is as certain that the baptism of
Christ can be given by those who have strayed from the fold, as that it
could not be lost when they strayed; on which subject we have already
said much.  Nor should we ourselves venture to assert anything of the
kind, were we not supported by the unanimous authority of the whole
Church, to which he himself would unquestionably have yielded, if at
that time the truth of this question had been placed beyond dispute by
the investigation and decree of a plenary Council.  For if he quotes
Peter as an example for his allowing himself quietly and peacefully to
be corrected by one junior colleague, how much more readily would he
himself, with the Council of his province, have yielded to the authority
of the whole world, when the truth had been thus brought to light?  For,
indeed, so holy and peaceful a soul would have been most ready to assent
to the arguments of any single person who could prove to him the truth;
and perhaps he even did so, <span id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md)
though we have no knowledge of the fact.  For it was neither possible
that all the proceedings which took place between the bishops at that
time should have been committed to writing, nor are we acquainted with
all that was so committed.  For how could a matter which was involved in
such mists of disputation even have been brought to the full
illumination and authoritative decision of a plenary Council, had it not
first been known to be discussed for some considerable time in the
various districts of the world, with many discussions and comparisons of
the views of the bishop on every side?  But this is one effect of the
soundness of peace, that when any doubtful points are long under
investigation, and when, on account of the difficulty of arriving at the
truth, they produce difference of opinion in the course of brotherly
disputation, till men at last arrive at the unalloyed truth; yet the
bond of unity remains, lest in the part that is cut away there should be
found the incurable wound of deadly error.
