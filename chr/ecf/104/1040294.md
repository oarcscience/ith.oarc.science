<span id="v.iv.v.xvi"></span>

<span id="v.iv.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—</span>21.  But when it is said
that "the Holy Spirit is given by the imposition of hands in the
Catholic Church only, I suppose that our ancestors meant that we should
understand thereby what the apostle says, "Because the love of God is
shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
us." <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298.md)   For this is that very
love which is wanting in all who are cut off from the communion of the
Catholic Church; and for lack of this, "though they speak with the
tongues of men and of angels, though they understand all mysteries and
all knowledge, and though they have the gift of prophecy, and all faith,
so that they could remove mountains, and though they bestow all their
goods to feed the poor, and though they give their bodies to be burned,
it profiteth them nothing."  <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md)
  But those are wanting in God’s love who do not care for the unity of
the Church; and consequently we are right in understanding that the Holy
Spirit may be said not to be received except in the Catholic <span
id="page_443">p. 443</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xvi-Page_443"></span>Church.  For the Holy Spirit is not only
given by the laying on of hands amid the testimony of temporal sensible
miracles, as He was given in former days to be the credentials of a
rudimentary faith, and for the extension of the first beginnings of the
Church.  For who expects in these days that those on whom hands are laid
that they may receive the Holy Spirit should forthwith begin to speak
with tongues? but it is understood that invisibly and imperceptibly, on
account of the bond of peace, divine love is breathed into their hearts,
so that they may be able to say, "Because the love of God is shed abroad
in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."  But there are
many operations of the Holy Spirit, which the same apostle commemorates
in a certain passage at such length as he thinks sufficient, and then
concludes:  "But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
dividing to every man severally as He will." <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md)   Since, then, the sacrament is one
thing, which even Simon Magus could have; <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) and the operation of the Spirit is
another thing, which is even often found in wicked men, as Saul had the
gift of prophecy; <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) and that
operation of the same Spirit is a third thing, which only the good can
have, as "the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:" <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md)   whatever, therefore, may be
received by heretics and schismatics, the charity which covereth the
multitude of sins is the especial gift of Catholic unity and peace; nor
is it found in all that are within that bond, since not all that are
within it are of it, as we shall see in the proper place.  At any rate,
outside the bond that love cannot exist, without which all the other
requisites, even if they can be recognized and approved, cannot profit
or release from sin.  But the laying on of hands in reconciliation to
the Church is not, like baptism, incapable of repetition; for what is it
more than a prayer offered over a man? <span

he mentions below, Book V. c. xxiii.:  "If the laying on of hands were
not applied to one coming from heresy, he would be, as it were, judged
to be wholly blameless."
