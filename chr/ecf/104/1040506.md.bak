<span id="v.v.iv.xix"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—</span>42.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xix-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"The Lord Jesus Christ commands us, saying, ‘When they persecute you in
this city, flee ye into another; and if they persecute you in that, flee
yet into a third; for verily I say unto you, ye shall not have gone over
the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.’ <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md)   If He gives us this warning in
the case of Jews and pagans, you who call yourself a Christian ought not
to imitate the dreadful deeds of the Gentiles.  Or do you serve God in
such wise that we should be murdered at your hands?  You do err, you do
err, if you are wretched enough to entertain such a belief as this.  For
God does not have butchers for His priests."

<span id="v.v.iv.xix-p3"></span>43.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xix-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  To flee from one
state to another from the face of persecution has not been enjoined as
precept or permission on heretics or schismatics, such as you are; but
it was enjoined on the preachers of the gospel, whom you resist.  And
this we may easily prove in this wise:  you are now in your own cities,
and no man persecutes you.  You must therefore come forth, and give an
account of your separation.  For it cannot be maintained that, as the
weakness of the flesh is excused when it yields before the violence of
persecution, so truth also ought to yield to falsehood.  Furthermore, if
you are suffering persecution, why do you not retire from the cities in
which you are, that you may fulfill the instructions which you quote out
of the gospel?  But if you are not suffering persecution, why are you
unwilling to reply to us?  Or if the fact be that you <span
id="page_540">p. 540</span> <span id="v.v.iv.xix-Page_540"></span>are
afraid lest, when you should have made reply, you then should suffer
persecution, in that case how are you following the example of those
preachers to whom it was said, "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the
midst of wolves?"  To whom it was also further said "Fear not them which
kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul." <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md)   And how do you escape the charge
of acting contrary to the injunction of the Apostle Peter, who says, "Be
ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of
the faith and hope that is in you?" <span
id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md)   And, lastly, wherefore are you
ever eager to annoy the Catholic Churches by the most violent
disturbances, whenever it is in your power, as is proved by innumerable
instances of simple fact?  But you say that you must defend your places,
and that you resist with cudgels and massacres and with whatever else
you can.  Wherefore in such a case did you not hearken to the voice of
the Lord, when He says, "But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil"?
 <span id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md)   Or, allowing that it is
possible that in some cases it should be right for violent men to be
resisted by bodily force, and that it does not violate the precept which
we receive from the Lord, "But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil,"
why may it not also be that a pious man should eject an impious man, or
a just man him that is unjust, in the exercise of duly and lawfully
constituted authority, from seats which are unlawfully usurped, or
retained to the despite of God?  For you would not say that the false
prophets suffered persecution at the hands of Elijah, in the same sense
that Elijah suffered persecution from the wickedest of kings? <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md)   Or that because the Lord was
scourged by His persecutors, therefore those whom He Himself drove out
of the temple with scourges are to be put in comparison with His
sufferings?  It remains, therefore, that we should acknowledge that
there is no other question requiring solution, except whether you have
been pious or impious in separating yourselves from the communion of the
whole world.  For if it shall be found that you have acted impiously,
you would not be surprised if there should be no lack of ministers of
God by whom you might be scourged, seeing that you suffer persecution
not from us, but as it is written, from their own abominations. <span
