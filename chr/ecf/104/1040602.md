<span id="v.v.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>6.  Do you, therefore, holy
scions of our one Catholic mother, beware with all the watchfulness of
which you are capable, in due submission to the Lord, of the example of
crime and error such as this.  With however great light of learning and
of reputation he may shine, however much he may boast himself to be a
precious stone, who endeavors to lead you after him, remember always
that that brave woman who alone is lovely only to her husband, whom holy
Scripture portrays to us in the last chapter of the Book of Proverbs, is
more precious than any precious stones.  Let no one say, I will follow
such an one, for it was even he that made me a Christian; or, I will
follow such an one, for it was even he that baptized me.  For "neither
is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that
giveth the increase." <span id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md)   And
"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in
him." <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md)   No one also that
preaches the name of Christ, and handles or administers the sacrament of
Christ, is to be followed in opposition to the unity of Christ.  "Let
every man prove his own work; and then shall he have rejoicing in
himself alone, and not in another.  For every man shall bear his own
burden," <span id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) —the burden, that
is, of rendering an account; for "every one of shall give an account of
himself.  Let us not therefore judge one another any more." <span
id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md)   For, so far as relates to the
burdens of mutual love, "bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill
the law of Christ.  For if a man think himself to be something, when he
is nothing, he deceiveth himself." <span
id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md)   Let us therefore "forbear one
another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace;" <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) for no one who
gathers outside that peace is gathering with Christ; but "he that
gathering not with Him scattereth abroad." <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md)
