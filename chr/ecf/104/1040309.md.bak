<span id="v.iv.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—</span>18.  What shall we say of
what is also wonderful, that he who carefully observes may find that it
is possible that certain persons, without violating Christian charity,
may yet teach what is useless, as Peter wished to compel the Gentiles to
observe Jewish customs, <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) as
Cyprian himself would force heretics to be baptized anew? whence the
apostle says to such good members, who are rooted in charity, and yet
walk not rightly in some points, "If in anything ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you;" <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) and that some again, though devoid
of charity, may teach something wholesome? of whom the Lord says, "The
scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:  all therefore whatsoever
they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their
works:  for they say and do not." <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md)   Whence the apostle also says of
those envious and malicious ones who yet preach salvation through
Christ, "Whether in pretense, or in truth, let Christ be
preached." <span id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md)   Wherefore, both
within and without, the waywardness of man is to be corrected, but the
divine sacraments and utterances are not to be attributed to men.  He is
not, therefore, a "patron of heretics" who refuses to attribute to them
what he knows not to belong to them, even though it be found among
them.  We do not grant baptism to be theirs; but we recognize His
baptism of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizeth," <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) wheresoever we find it.  But if
"the treacherous and blasphemous man" continue in his treachery and
blasphemy, he receives no "remission of sins either without" or within
the Church; or if, by the power of the sacrament, he receives it for the
moment, the same force operates both without and within, as the power of
the name of Christ used to work the expulsion of devils even without the
Church.
