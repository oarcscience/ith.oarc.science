<span id="v.v.iv.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> 62.—139.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"And again it is written, ‘Every sin which a man shall sin is without
the body; but he that sinneth in the Holy Spirit, it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.’"

<span id="page_565">p. 565</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.lxii-Page_565"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.lxii-p2"></span>140.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  This too is not
written as you have quoted it, and see how far it has led you astray. 
The apostle, writing to the Corinthians, says, "Every sin that a man
doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth
against his own body." <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155)   But
this is one thing, and that is another which the Lord said in the
gospel:  "All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: 
but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven
him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come." <span
id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156)   But you have begun a sentence
from the writing of the apostle, and ended it as though it were one from
the gospel, which I fancy you have done not with any intention to
deceive, but through mistake; for neither passage has any bearing on the
matter in hand.  And why you have said this, and in what sense you have
said it, I am wholly unable to perceive, unless it be that, whereas you
had said above that all were condemned by the Lord who had broken any
one of His commandments, you have considered since how many there are in
your party who break not one but many of them; and lest an objection
should be brought against you on that score, you have sought, by way of
surpassing the difficulty, to bring in a distinction of sins, whereby it
might be seen that it is one thing to break a commandment in respect of
which pardon may easily be obtained, another thing to sin against the
Holy Ghost, which shall receive no forgiveness, either in this world or
in the world to come.  In your dread, therefore, of infection from sin,
you were unwilling to pass this over in silence; and again, in your
dread of a question too deep for your powers, you wish to touch
cursorily on it in passing, in such a state of agitation, that, just as
men who are setting about a task in haste, and consequent confusion, are
wont to fasten their dress or shoes awry, so you have not thought fit
either to see what belongs to what, or in what context or what sense the
passage which you quote occurs.  But what is the nature of that sin
which shall not be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to
come, you are so far from knowing, that, though you believe that we are
actually living in it, you yet promise us forgiveness of it through your
baptism.  And yet how could this be possible, if the sin be of such a
nature that it cannot be forgiven, either in this world or in the world
to come?
