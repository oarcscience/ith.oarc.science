<span id="iv.x.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Measure, Form, and Order, Generic
Goods in Things Made by God.</span>

<span id="iv.x.v-p2"></span>For we Catholic Christians worship God, from
whom are all good things whether great or small; from whom is all
measure great or small; from whom is all form great or small; from whom
is all order great or small.  For all things in proportion as they are
better measured, formed, and ordered, are assuredly good in a higher
degree; but in proportion as they are measured, formed, and ordered in
an inferior degree, are they the less good.  These three things,
therefore, measure, form, and order,—not to speak of innumerable other
things that are shown to pertain to these three,—these three things,
therefore, measure, form, order, are as it were generic goods in things
made by God, whether in spirit or in body.  God is, therefore, above
every measure of the creature, above every form, above every order, nor
is He above by local spaces, but by ineffable and singular potency, from
whom is every measure, every form, every order.  These three things,
where they are great, are great goods, where they are small, are small
goods; where they are absent, there is no good.  And again where these
things are great, there are great natures, where they are small, there
are small natures, where they are absent, there is no nature.  Therefore
all nature is good.
