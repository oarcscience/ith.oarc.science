<span id="v.v.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—</span>For, so long as they
escaped detection, they could not bestow faith on any whom they
baptized, but only guilt, if it be true that whosoever receives faith
from one that is faithless receives not faith, but guilt.  Let them
therefore be baptized by the good, that they may be enabled to receive
not guilt, but faith.

<span id="v.v.iii.iii-p2"></span>4.  But how, again, shall they have any
certainty about the good who are to give them faith, if what we look to
is the conscience of the giver, which is unseen by the eyes of the
proposed recipient?  Therefore, according to their judgment, the
salvation of the spirit is made uncertain, so long as in opposition to
the holy Scriptures, which say, "It is better to trust in the Lord than
to put confidence in <span id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span
id="v.v.iii.iii-Page_521"></span>man," <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921) and, "Cursed be the man that
trusteth in man," <span id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922) they remove
the hope of those who are to be baptized from the Lord their God, and
persuade them that it should be placed in man; the practical result of
which is, that their salvation becomes not merely uncertain, but
actually null and void.  For "salvation belongeth unto the Lord," <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923) and "vain is the help of
man." <span id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924)   Therefore, whosoever
places his trust in man, even in one whom he knows to be just and
innocent, is accursed.  Whence also the Apostle Paul finds fault with
those who said they were of Paul saying, "Was Paul crucified for you? or
were ye baptized in the name of Paul?" <span
