id="iv.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Relation of Manichæism to the
Old Babylonian Religion as Seen in Mandæism and Sabeanism.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.v-p2"></span>It would have been strange indeed if the
old Babylonian religion, after dominating the minds of the inhabitants
of Mesopotamia for so many centuries, had given place completely to the
religion of the Medo-Persian conquerors of the country.  Magism itself
was a mixture of old Babylonian, Medic and Persian elements.  But there
is much reason for believing that the primitive Babylonian faith, in a
more or less pure form, persisted until long after the time of Mani,
nay, that it has maintained its ground even till the present day.  The
researches of Chwolson, Nöldeke, Kessler and others, in the literature
and history of the Mandæans and the Sabeans, combined in the last case
at least with accurate knowledge of old Babylonian literature and
religion, have rendered it highly probable that representatives of the
old Babylonian faith were numerous in Mesopotomia and the adjoining
regions at the time of Mani, and that Mani himself was more or less
closely connected with it.  The Mandæans were a Gnostic sect of the
Ophitic type, without Christian elements.  It is the opinion of Kessler,
who has devoted much attention to this sect and to the relations of
occult religious matters in general in Mesopotomia, that "the source of
all Gnosis, and especially the immediate source of Ophitic Gnosis, is
not the doctrine of the Persian Zoroaster, not Phœnicean heathenism, not
the theory and practise of Greek mysteries, but the old
Babylonian-Chaldaic national religion, which maintained itself in
Mesopotomia and Babylonia, the abode of the Ophites, Perates, Mandæans,
until the post-Christian centuries, and was now opposed by the Gentiles
in a mystical-ascetical form to Christianity."  The close connection of
the Mandæans with the Ophites, and of both with the old Babylonian
religion, would seem to be established beyond question.  The relation of
Manichæism to Mandæism has been by no means so clearly shown.  Let us
look at some of the supposed points of contact.  Mani’s connection with
the Mugtasilah sect (or Baptizers) has already been mentioned.  Kessler
seeks to identify this party with the Mandæans, or at least to establish
a community of origin and of fundamental principles in the two parties. 
He would connect with the old Babylonian sect, of which ceremonial
baptism seems to have been a common characteristic, the Palestinian
Hemero-baptists, Elkesaites, Nazareans, Ebionites, etc.  There is
nothing improbable about this supposition.  Certainly we find elements
in Palestinian heresy during the early Christian centuries, which we can
hardly suppose to have been indigenous.  And there is no more likely
source of occult religious influence than Babylonia, unless it be Egypt,
and there is much reason for supposing that even in Alexandria
Babylonian influences were active before and after the beginning of the
Christian era.  Besides, a large number of Gnostic elements different
from these can be traced to Egypt.  How far the Mandæans of modern
times, and as they are described in extant literature, correspond with
representatives of the old Babylonian religion in the third century,
cannot be determined with complete certainty.  Yet there is much about
this party that has a primitive appearance, and the tenacity with which
it has held aloof from Judaism, Manichæism, Mohammedanism, and Oriental
Christianity, during centuries of conflict and oppression, says much for
its conservatism.  It would extend this chapter unduly to describe the
elaborate cosmogony, mythology, hierarchy, ceremonial, etc., of this
interesting party.  For the illustration of Christian Gnosticism the
facts that have been brought out are of the utmost value.  As compared
with Manichæism, there is a remarkable parallelism <span id="page_22">p.
22</span> <span id="iv.ii.v-Page_22"></span>between the two kingdoms and
their subordinates or æons; the conflict between Primordial Man and the
King of Darkness has its counterpart in Mandæism.  The close connection
of the Mandæan and the Manichæan cosmogony, together with similar views
about water in the two parties, would make it highly probable that the
Manichæans, like the Mandæans, practised some kind of ceremonial
ablutions.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p3"></span>What, now, are the grounds on which the
connection of these systems with the old Babylonian religion is based? 
The dualistic element in the old Babylonian system was pointed out
above.  Kessler seeks to establish an almost complete parallelism
between the Mandæan and Manichæan cosmological and mythological systems
on the one hand, and the old Babylonian on the other.  That there are
points of striking resemblance it is certain.  There is ground to
suspect, however, that he has been led by partiality for a theory of his
own to minimize unduly the Zoroastrian and Buddhist influence and to
magnify unduly the old Babylonian.  Be that as it may, there remains an
important residuum of solid fact which must be taken account of by all
future students of Manichæism.  There is reason to hope that future work
along the lines of Kessler’s researches will bring to light much
additional material.
