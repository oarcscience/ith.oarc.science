<span id="v.iv.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—</span>16.  For this reason,
then, we hold them to be enemies, because we speak the truth, because we
are afraid to be silent, <span id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.xi-Page_433"></span>because we fear to shrink from pressing
our point with all the force that lies within our power, because we obey
the apostle when he says, "Preach the word; be instant in season out of
season; reprove, rebuke, exhort." <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md)   But, as the gospel says, "They
love the praise of men more than the praise of God;" <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) and while they fear to incur blame
for a time, they do not fear to incur damnation for ever.  They see,
too, themselves what wrong they are doing; they see that they have no
answer which they can make, but they overspread the inexperienced with
mists, whilst they themselves are being swallowed up alive,—that is, are
perishing knowingly and willfully.  They see that men are amazed, and
look with abhorrence on the fact that they have divided themselves into
many schisms, especially in Carthage, <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md) the capital and most noted city of
all Africa; they have endeavored to patch up the disgrace of their
rags.  Thinking that they could annihilate the followers of Maximianus,
they pressed heavily on them through the agency of Optatus the
Gildonian; <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) they inflicted on
them many wrongs amid the cruellest of persecutions.  Then they received
back some, thinking that all could be converted under the influence of
the same terror; but they were unwilling to do those whom they received
the wrong of baptizing afresh those who had been baptized by them in
their schism, or rather of causing them to be baptized again within
their communion by the very same men by whom they had been baptized
outside, and thus they at once made an exception to their own impious
custom.  They feel how wickedly they are acting in assailing the baptism
of the whole world, when they have received the baptism of the followers
of Maximianus.  But they fear those whom they have themselves
rebaptized, lest they should receive no mercy from them, when they have
shown it to others; lest these should call them to account for their
souls when they have ceased to destroy those of other men.

<span id="v.iv.iv.xi-p4"></span> He is alluding to that chief schism
among the Donatists, which occurred when Maximianus was consecrated
bishop of Carthage, in opposition to Primianus, probably immediately
after the Synod of Cabarsussum, 393.

<span id="v.iv.iv.xi-p5"></span> Optatus, a Donatist bishop of Thamogade
in Numidia, was called Gildonianus from his adherence to Gildo, Count of
Africa, and generalissimo of the province under the elder Theodosius. 
On his death, in 395 <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xi-p5.1"></span>A.D.</span>, Gildo usurped supreme
authority, and by his aid Optatus was enabled to oppress the Catholics
in the province, till, in 398 <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xi-p5.2"></span>A.D.</span>, Gildo was defeated by his
brother Mascezel, and destroyed himself, and Optatus was put in prison,
where he died soon afterwards.  He is not to be confounded with Optatus,
Bishop of Milevis, the strenuous opponent of the Donatists.
