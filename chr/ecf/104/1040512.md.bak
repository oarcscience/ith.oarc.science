<span id="v.v.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—</span>58.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"For when you in your guilt perform what is false, I do not celebrate
baptism twice, which you have never celebrated once."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxv-p2"></span>59.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxv-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  In the first
place, you do not convict us of guilt.  And if a guilty man baptizes
with a false baptism, then none of those have true baptism who are
baptized by men in your party, that are, I do not say openly, but even
secretly guilty.  For if he who gives baptism gives something that is
God’s, if he is already guilty in the sight of God, how can he be giving
something that is God’s if a guilty man cannot give true baptism?  But
in reality you wait till he is guilty in your sight as well, as though
what he proposes to confer were something that belonged to you.
