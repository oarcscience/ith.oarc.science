<span id="v.iv.ix.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—</span>32.  Marcellus of
Zama <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808.md) said:  "Since sins are
remitted only in the baptism of the Church, he who does not baptize a
heretic holds communion with a sinner." <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xvii-p4"></span>33.  What, does he who holds communion
<span id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix.xvii-Page_505"></span>with one who does this not hold
communion with a sinner?  But what else did all of them do, "in judging
no one, or removing from the right of communion any one who entertained
a different opinion"?  Where, then, is the Church?  Are those things not
an obstacle to those who are patient, and tolerate the tares lest the
wheat should be rooted out together with them?  I would have them
therefore say, who have committed the sacrilege of schism by separating
themselves from the whole world, how it comes that they have in their
mouths the judgment of Cyprian, while they do not have in their hearts
the patience of Cyprian.  But to this Marcellus we have an answer in
what has been said above concerning baptism and the remission of sins,
explaining how there can be baptism in a man although there be in him no
remission of his sins.
