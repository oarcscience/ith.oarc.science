<span id="v.v.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—</span>37.  What shall we say
of what he himself advanced in his epistle, that "Quodvultdeus, having
been convicted of two <span id="page_612">p. 612</span> <span
id="v.v.v.xxxii-Page_612"></span>adulteries, and cast out from among
you, was received by those of our party?" <span
id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md)   What then (I would speak without
prejudice to this man, who proved his case to be a good one, or at least
persuaded men that it was so), when such men among you, being as yet
undetected, administer baptism, what is received at their hands,—faith,
or guilt?  Surely not faith, because they have not the conscience of one
who gives in holiness to cleanse the conscience of the recipient.  But
yet not guilt either, in virtue of that added word:  "For he that has
received his faith wittingly from one that is faithless, receives not
faith but guilt."  But when men were baptized by those of whom I speak,
they were surely ignorant what sort of men they were.  Furthermore, not
receiving faith from their baptizers, who had not the conscience of one
that gives in holiness, and not receiving guilt, because they were
baptized not knowing but in ignorance of their faults, they therefore
remained without faith and without guilt.  They are not, therefore, in
the number of men of such abandoned character.  But neither can they be
in the number of the faithful, because, as they could not receive guilt,
so neither could they receive faith from their baptizers.  But we see
that they are reputed by you in the number of the faithful, and that no
one of you declares his opinion that they ought to be baptized, but all
of you hold valid the baptism which they have already received.  They
have therefore received faith; and yet they have not received it from
those who had not the conscience of one that gives in holiness, to
cleanse the conscience of the recipient.  Whence then did they receive
it?  This is the point from which I make my effort; this is the question
that I press most earnestly; to this I do most urgently demand an
answer.
