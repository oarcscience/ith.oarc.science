<span id="iv.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—The Goodness of God Prevents
Corruption from Bringing Anything to Non-Existence.  The Difference
Between Creating and Forming.</span>

<span id="iv.v.ix-p2"></span>9.  But the goodness of God does not permit
the accomplishment of this end, but so orders all things that fall away
that they may exist where their existence is most suitable, till in the
order of their movements they return to that from which they fell
away. <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162) <span id="page_72">p.
72</span> <span id="iv.v.ix-Page_72"></span>Thus, when rational souls
fall away from God, although they possess the greatest amount of
free-will, He ranks them in the lower grades of creation, where their
proper place is.  So they suffer misery by the divine judgment, while
they are ranked suitably to their deserts.  Hence we see the excellence
of that saying which you are always inveighing against so strongly, "I
make good things, and create evil things." <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163)   To create is to form and arrange. 
So in some copies it is written, "I make good things and form evil
things."  To make is used of things previously not in existence; but to
form is to arrange what had some kind of existence, so as to improve and
enlarge it.  Such are the things which God arranges when He says, "I
form evil things," meaning things which are falling off, and so tending
to non-existence,—not things which have reached that to which they
tend.  For it has been said, Nothing is allowed in the providence of God
to go the length of non-existence. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164)

<span id="iv.v.ix-p6"></span>10.  These things might be discussed more
fully and at greater length, but enough has been said for our purpose in
dealing with you.  We have only to show you the gate which you despair
of finding, and make the uninstructed despair of it too.  You can be
made to enter only by good-will, on which the divine mercy bestows
peace, as the song in the Gospel says, "Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace to men of good-will." <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165)   It is enough, I say, to have shown
you that there is no way of solving the religious question of good and
evil, unless whatever is, as far as it is, is from God; while as far as
it falls away from being it is not of God, and yet is always ordered by
Divine Providence in agreement with the whole system.  If you do not yet
see this, I know nothing else that I can do but to discuss the things
already said with greater particularity.  For nothing save piety and
purity can lead the mind to greater things.

<span id="iv.v.ix-p3"></span> In *Retract*. i. 7, § 6, it is said: 
"This must not be understood to mean that all things return to that from
which they fell away, as Origen believed, but only those which do
return.  Those who shall be punished in everlasting fire do not return
to God, from whom they fell away.  Still they are in order as existing
in punishment where their existence is most suitable."  \[This does not
really meet the difficulty suggested on a preceding page.—A.H.N.\]
