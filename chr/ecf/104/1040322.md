<span id="v.iv.vi.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—</span>32.  And if any one
seek for divine authority in this matter, though what is held by the
whole Church, and that not as instituted by Councils, but as a matter of
invariable custom, is rightly held to have been handed down by
apostolical authority, still we can form a true conjecture of the value
of the sacrament of baptism in the case of infants, from the parallel of
circumcision, which was received by God’s earlier people, and before
receiving which Abraham was justified, as Cornelius also was enriched
with the gift of the Holy Spirit before he was baptized.  Yet the
apostle says of Abraham himself, that "he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith," having already
believed in his heart, so that "it was counted unto him for
righteousness." <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463)   Why,
therefore, was it commanded him that he should circumcise every male
child in order on the eighth day, <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464) though it could not yet believe
with the heart, that it should be counted unto it for righteousness,
because the sacrament in itself was of great avail?  And this was made
manifest by the message of an angel in the case of Moses’ son; for when
he was carried by his mother, being yet uncircumcised, it was required,
by manifest present peril, that he should be circumcised, <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465) and when this was done, the danger
of death was removed.  As therefore in Abraham the justification of
faith came first, and circumcision was added afterwards as the seal of
faith; so in Cornelius the spiritual sanctification came first in the
gift of the Holy Spirit, and the sacrament of regeneration was added
afterwards in the laver of baptism.  And as in Isaac, who was
circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, the seal of this
righteousness of faith was given first, and afterwards, as he imitated
the faith of his father, the righteousness itself followed as he grew
up, of which the seal had been given before when he was an infant; so in
infants, who are baptized, <span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xxiv-Page_462"></span>the sacrament of regeneration is given
first, and if they maintain a Christian piety, conversion also in the
heart will follow, of which the mysterious sign had gone before in the
outward body.  And as in the thief the gracious goodness of the Almighty
supplied what had been wanting in the sacrament of baptism, because it
had been missing not from pride or contempt, but from want of
opportunity; so in infants who die baptized, we must believe that the
same grace of the Almighty supplies the want, that, not from perversity
of will, but from insufficiency of age, they can neither believe with
the heart unto righteousness, nor make confession with the mouth unto
salvation.  Therefore, when others take the vows for them, that the
celebration of the sacrament may be complete in their behalf, it is
unquestionably of avail for their dedication to God, because they cannot
answer for themselves.  But if another were to answer for one who could
answer for himself, it would not be of the same avail.  In accordance
with which rule, we find in the gospel what strikes every one as natural
when he reads it, "He is of age, he shall speak for himself." <span
