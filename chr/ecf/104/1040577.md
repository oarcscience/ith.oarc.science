class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xc-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Therefore I say, He ordained that we should undergo death for the
faith, which each man should do for the communion of the Church.  For
Christianity makes progress by the deaths of its followers.  For if
death were feared by the faithful, no man would be found to live with
perfect faith.  For the Lord Christ says, <span id="page_577">p.
577</span> <span id="v.v.iv.xc-Page_577"></span>‘Except a corn of wheat
fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:  but if it die, it
bringeth forth much fruit.’" <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md)

<span id="v.v.iv.xc-p3"></span>197.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xc-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I should be glad
to know which of your party it was who first threw himself over a
precipice.  For truly that grain of corn was fruitful from which so
great a crop of similar suicides has sprung.  Tell me, when you make
mention of the words of the Lord, that He says a grain of wheat shall
die and bring forth much fruit, why do you envy the real fruit, which
has most truly <span id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md) sprung up
throughout the whole world, and bring up against it all the charges of
the tares or chaff which you have ever either heard of or invented?
