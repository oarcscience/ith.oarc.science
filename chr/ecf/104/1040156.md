<span id="iv.ix.x-p1"></span><span class="c7"><span
id="iv.ix.x-p1.1"></span>Book VIII.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.x-p2"></span>Faustus maintains that to hold to the Old
Testament after the giving of the New is putting new cloth on an old
garment.  Augustin further explains the relation of the Old Testament to
the New, and reproaches the Manichæans with carnality.

<span id="iv.ix.x-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.x-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  Another reason for not
receiving the Old Testament is, that I am provided with the New; and
Scripture says that old and new do not agree.  For "no one putteth a
piece of new cloth unto an old garment, otherwise the rent is made
worse." <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369)   To avoid making a
worse rent, as you have done, I do not mix Christian newness with Hebrew
oldness.  Every one accounts it mean, when a man has got a new dress,
not to give the old one to his inferiors.  So, even if I were a Jew by
birth, as the apostles were, it would be proper for me, on receiving the
New Testament, to discard the Old, as the apostles did.  And having the
advantage of being born free from the yoke of bondage, and being early
introduced into the full liberty of Christ, what a foolish and
ungrateful wretch I should be to put myself again under the yoke!  This
is what Paul blames the Galatians for; because, going back to
circumcision, they turned again to the weak and beggarly elements,
whereunto they desired again to be in bondage. <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370)   Why should I do what I see another
blamed for doing?  My going into bondage would be worse than their
returning to it.

<span id="iv.ix.x-p6"></span>2.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.x-p6.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  We have already shown
sufficiently why and how we maintain the authority of the Old Testament,
not for the imitation of Jewish bondage, but for the confirmation of
Christian liberty.  It is not I, but the apostle, who says, "All these
things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our
admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come." <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371)  We do not therefore, as bondmen,
observe what was enjoined as predictive of us; but as free, we read what
was written to confirm us.  So any one may see that the apostle
remonstrates with the Galatians not for devoutly reading what Scripture
says of circumcision, but for superstitiously desiring to be
circumcised.  We do not put a new cloth to an old garment, but we are
instructed in the kingdom of heaven, like the householder, whom the Lord
describes as bringing out of his treasure things new and old. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372)   He who puts a new cloth to an old
garment is the man who attempts spiritual self-denial before he has
renounced fleshly hope.  Examine the passage, and you will see that,
when the Lord was asked about fasting, He replied, "No man putteth a new
cloth to an old garment."  The disciples had still a carnal affection
for the Lord; for they were afraid that, if He died, they would lose
Him.  So He calls Peter Satan for dissuading Him from suffering, because
he understood not the things of God, but the things of men. <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373)   The fleshly character of your hope
is evident from your fancies about the kingdom of God, and from your
paying homage and devotion to the light of the sun, which the carnal eye
perceives, as if it were an image of heaven.  So your carnal mind is the
old garment to which you join your fasts.  Moreover, if a new cloth and
an old garment do not agree, how do the members of your God come to be
not only joined or fastened, but to be united far more intimately by
mixture and coherence to the principles of darkness?  Perhaps both are
old, because both are false, and both of the carnal mind.  Or perhaps
you wish to prove that one was new and the other old, by the rent being
made worse, in tearing away the unhappy piece of the kingdom of light,
to be doomed to eternal imprisonment in the mass of darkness.  So this
pretended artist in the fashions of the sacred Scriptures is found
stitching together absurdities, and dressing himself in the rags of his
own invention.
