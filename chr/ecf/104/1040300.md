<span id="v.iv.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—</span>2.  All the more, then,
because "we are fighting <span id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) for
the honor and unity" of the Church, let us beware of giving to heretics
the credit of whatever we acknowledged among them as belonging to the
Church; but let us teach them by argument, that what they possess that
is derived from unity is of no efficacy to their salvation, unless they
shall return to that same unity.  For "the water of the Church is full
of faith, and salvation, and holiness" <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) to those who use it rightly.  No
one, however, can use it well outside the Church.  But to those who use
it perversely, whether within or without the Church, it is employed to
work punishment, and does not conduce to their reward.  And so baptism
"cannot be corrupted and polluted," though it be handled by the corrupt
or by adulterers, just as also "the Church herself is uncorrupt, and
pure, and chaste." <span id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md)   And so
no share in it belongs to the avaricious, or thieves, or usurers,—many
of whom, by the testimony of Cyprian himself in many places of his
letters, exist not only without, but actually within the Church,—and yet
they both are baptized and do baptize, with no change in their hearts.

<span id="v.iv.vi.ii-p5"></span>3.  For this, too, he says, in one of
his epistles <span id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) to the clergy on
the subject of prayer toGod, in which, after the fashion of the holy
Daniel, he represents the sins of his people as falling upon himself. 
For among many other evils of which he makes mention, he speaks of them
also as "renouncing the world in words only and not in deeds;" as the
apostle says of certain men, "They profess that they know God, but in
works they deny Him." <span id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md)  
These, therefore, the blessed Cyprian shows to be contained within the
Church herself, who are baptized without their hearts being changed for
the better, seeing that they renounce the world in words and not in
deeds, as the Apostle Peter says, "The like figure whereunto even
baptism doth also now save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the
flesh, but the answer of a good conscience)," <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md) which certainly they had not of
whom it is said that they "renounced the world in words only, and not in
deeds;" and yet he does his utmost, by chiding and convincing them, to
make them at length walk in the way of Christ, and be His friends rather
than friends of the world.
