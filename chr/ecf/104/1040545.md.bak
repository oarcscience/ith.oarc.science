<span id="v.v.iv.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 58.—</span>131.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lviii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"It is written, ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor.’  When you falsely declare to the kings of this world that we
hold your opinions, do you not make up a falsehood?"

<span id="v.v.iv.lviii-p2"></span>132.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lviii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  If those are
not our opinions which you hold, neither were they your opinions which
you received from the followers of Maximianus.  But if they were
therefore yours, because they were guilty of a sacrilegious schism in
not communicating with the party of Donatus, take heed what ground you
occupy, and with whose inheritance you refuse communion, and consider
what answer you can make, not to the kings of this world, but to Christ
your King.  Of Him it is said, "He shall have dominion also from sea to
sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth." <span
id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149.md)   From what river does it mean,
save that where He was baptized, and where the dove descended on Him,
that mighty token of charity and unity?  But you refuse communion with
this unity, and occupy as yet the place of unity; and you bring us into
disfavor with the kings of this world in making use of the edicts of the
proconsul to expel your schismatics from the place of the party of
Donatus.  These are not mere words flying at random through the empty
void:  the men are still alive, the states bear witness to the fact, the
archives of the proconsuls and of the several towns are quoted in
evidence of it.  Let then the voice of calumny be at length silent,
which would bring up against the whole earth the kings of this world,
through whose proconsuls you, yourselves a fragment, would not spare the
fragment which was separated from you.  When then we say that you hold
our opinions, we are not shown to be bearing false witness, unless you
can show that we are not in the Church of Christ, which indeed you never
cease alleging, but never will be able to establish; nay, in real truth,
when you say this, you are bringing a charge of false witness no longer
against us, but against the Lord Himself.  For we are in the Church
which was foretold by His own testimony, and where He bore witness to
His witnesses, saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole earth."  But you
show yourselves to be false witnesses not only from this, that you
resist this truth, but also in the very trial in which you joined issue
with the schism of Maximianus.  For if you were acting according to the
law of Christ, how much more consistently do certain Christian emperors
frame ordinances in accordance with it, if even pagan proconsuls can
follow its behests in passing judgment?  But if you thought that even
the laws of an earthly empire were to be summoned to your aid, we do not
blame you for this.  It is what Paul did when he bore witness before his
adversaries that he was a Roman citizen. <span
id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md)   But I would ask by what earthly
laws it is ordained that the followers of Maximianus should be driven
from their place?  You will find no law whatever to this effect.  But,
in point of fact, you have chosen to expel them under laws which have
been passed against heretics, and against yourselves among their
number.  You, as though by superior strength, have prevailed against the
weak.  Whence they, being wholly powerless, say that they are innocent,
like the wolf in the power of the lion.  Yet surely you could not use
laws which were passed against yourselves as instruments against others,
except by the aid of false witness.  For if those laws are founded on
truth, then do you come down from the position which you occupy; but if
on falsehood, why did you use them to drive others from the Church?  But
how if they both are founded on truth, and could not be used by you for
the expulsion of others except with the aid of falsehood?  For that the
judges might submit to their authority, they were willing to expel
heretics from the Church, from which they ought first to have expelled
yourselves; but you declared yourselves to be Catholics, that you might
es<span id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.lviii-Page_564"></span>cape the severity of the laws which
you employed to oppress others.  It is for you to determine what you
appear to yourselves among yourselves; at any rate, under those laws you
are not Catholics.  Why then have you either made them false, if they
are true, by your false witness, or made use of them, if they are false,
for the oppression of others?
