<span id="v.v.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—</span>27.  I think that I have
left unanswered none of the statements in the letter of Donatus, so far
at least as relates to what I have been able to find in that part of
which we are in possession.  I should be glad if they would produce the
other part as well, in case there should be anything in it which does
not admit of refutation.  But as for these answers which we have made to
him, with the help of God, I admonish your Christian love, that ye not
only communicate them to those who seek for them, but also force them on
those who show no longing for them.  Let them answer anything they will;
and if they shrink from sending a reply to us, let them at any rate send
letters to their own party, only not forbidding that the contents should
be shown to us.  For if they do this, they show their fruits most
openly, by which they are proved to demonstration to be ravening wolves
disguised in sheep’s clothing, in that they secretly lay snares for our
sheep, and openly shrink from giving any answer to the shepherds.  We
only lay to their charge the sin of schism, in which they are all most
thoroughly involved,—not the offenses of certain of their party, which
some of them declare to be displeasing to themselves.  If they, on the
other hand, abstain from charging us with the sins of other men, they
have nothing they can lay to our charge, and therefore they are wholly
unable to defend themselves from the charge of schism; because it is by
a wicked severance that they have separated themselves from the
threshing-floor of the Lord, and from the innocent company of the corn
that is growing throughout the world, on account of charges which either
are false, and invented by themselves, or even if true, involve the
chaff alone.
