id="iv.x.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—The Corruption of Rational Spirits
is on the One Hand Voluntary, on the Other Penal.</span>

<span id="iv.x.ix-p2"></span>But to the most excellent creatures, that
is, to rational spirits, God has offered this, that if they will not
they cannot be corrupted; that is, if they should maintain obedience
under the Lord their God, so should they adhere to his incorruptible
beauty; but if they do not will to maintain obedience, since willingly
they are corrupted in sins, unwillingly they shall be corrupted in
punishment, since God is such a good that it is well for no one who
deserts Him, and among the things made by God the rational nature is so
great a good, that there is no good by which it may be blessed except
God.  Sinners, therefore, are ordained to punishment; which ordination
is punishment for the reason that it is not conformable to their nature,
but it is justice because it is conformable to their fault.
