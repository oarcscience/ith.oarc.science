<span id="v.iv.vi.iv"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—</span>6.  We do not, therefore,
"acknowledge the baptism of heretics," <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350) when we refuse to baptize after
them; but because we acknowledge the ordinance to be of Christ even
among evil men, whether openly separated from us, or secretly severed
whilst within our body, we receive it with due respect, having corrected
those who were wrong in the points wherein they went astray.  However as
I seem to be hard pressed when it is said to me, "Does then a heretic
confer remission of sins?" so I in turn press hard when I say, Does then
he who violates the commands of Heaven, the avaricious man, the robber,
the usurer, the envious man, does he who renounces the world in words
and not in deeds, confer such remission?  If you mean by the force of
God’s sacrament, then both the one and the other; if by his own merit,
neither of them.  For that sacrament, even in the hands of wicked men,
is known to be of Christ; but neither the one nor the other of these men
is found in the body of the one uncorrupt, holy, chaste dove, which has
neither spot nor wrinkle.  And just as baptism is of no profit to the
man who renounces the world in words and not in deeds, so it is of no
profit to him who is baptized in heresy or schism; but each of them,
when he amends his ways, begins to receive profit from that which before
was not profitable, but was yet already in him.

<span id="v.iv.vi.iv-p3"></span>7.  "He therefore that is baptized in
heresy does not become the temple of God; <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351) but does it therefore follow that
he is not to be considered as baptized?  For neither does the avaricious
man, baptized within the Church, become the temple of God unless he
depart from his avarice; for they who become the temple of God certainly
inherit the kingdom of God.  But the apostle says, among <span
id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.iv-Page_449"></span>many
other things, "Neither the covetous, nor extortioners, shall inherit the
kingdom of God." <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352)   For in
another place the same apostle compares covetousness to the worship of
idols:  "Nor covetous man," he says, "who is an idolater;" <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353) which meaning the same Cyprian has
so far extended in a letter to Antonianus, that he did not hesitate to
compare the sin of covetousness with that of men who in time of
persecution had declared in writing that they would offer incense. <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354)   The man, then, who is baptized in
heresy in the name of the Holy Trinity, yet does not become the temple
of God unless he abandons his heresy, just as the covetous man who has
been baptized in the same name does not become the temple of God unless
he abandons his covetousness, which is idolatry.  For this, too, the
same apostle says:  "What agreement hath the temple of God with
idols?" <span id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355)   Let it not, then,
be asked of us "of what God he is made the temple" <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356) when we say that he is not made the
temple of God at all.  Yet he is not therefore unbaptized, nor does his
foul error cause that what he has received, consecrated in the words of
the gospel, should not be the holy sacrament; just as the other man’s
covetousness (which is idolatry) and great uncleanness cannot prevent
what he receives from being holy baptism, even though he be baptized
with the same words of the gospel by another man covetous like himself.
