<span id="iv.vi.xvi-p2"></span>24.  Give heed to these things, I beseech
you, dearly beloved.  Your dispositions I have well known.  If you now
concede to me the mind and the reason of any sort of man, these things
are far more certain than the things that we seemed to learn or rather
were compelled to believe.  Great God, God omnipotent, God of supreme
goodness, whose right it is to be believed and known to be inviolable
and unchangeable.  Trinal Unity, whom the Catholic Church worships, as
one who have experienced in myself Thy mercy, I supplicate Thee, that
Thou wilt not permit those with whom from boyhood I have lived most
harmoniously in every relation to dissent from me in Thy worship.  I see
how it was especially to be expected in this place that I should either
even then have defended the Catholic Scriptures attacked by the
Manichæans, if as I say, I had been cautious; or I should now show that
they can be defended.  But in other volumes God will aid my purpose, for
the moderate length of this, as I suppose, already asks to be
spared. <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219)
