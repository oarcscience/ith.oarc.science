<span id="ii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="ii-p3"></span>This fourth volume of St. Augustin’s Works
contains his polemical writings in vindication of the Catholic Church
against the heresy of the Manichæans, and the schism of the Donatists. 
The former are contained in Tom. II. and VIII., the latter in Tom. IX.,
of the Benedictine edition.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>Like the preceding volumes, this also is more
than a reprint of older translations, and contains important additions
not previously published.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>I.—<span class="c11"><span
id="ii-p5.1"></span>Seven Writings Against the Manichæan Heresy</span>. 
Four of these were translated by the Rev. <span class="c11"><span
id="ii-p5.2"></span>Richard Stothert</span>, of Bombay, for Dr. Dods’
edition, published by T. & T. Clark, Edinburgh, 1872, and revised by Dr.
<span class="c11"><span id="ii-p5.3"></span>Albert H. Newman</span>, of
Toronto, for the American edition.  The other three treatises are
translated, I believe for the first time, by Dr. Newman for this
edition.  (See Contents.)

<span id="ii-p6"></span>The Edinburgh translation, especially of the
first two treatises, is sufficiently faithful and idiomatic, and needed
very little alteration by the American editor, who compared it sentence
by sentence with the Latin original, and made changes only where they
seemed necessary.

<span id="ii-p7"></span>This part of the volume is also enriched by an
introductory essay of Dr. <span class="c11"><span
id="ii-p7.1"></span>Newman</span>, which embodies the literature and the
results of the most recent as well as the earlier researches concerning
that anti-Christian heresy.

<span id="ii-p8"></span>II.—<span class="c11"><span
id="ii-p8.1"></span>The Writings Against the Donatists</span>.  These
were well translated by the Rev. J. R. King, of Oxford, and are slightly
revised by Dr. <span class="c11"><span
id="ii-p8.2"></span>Hartranft</span>, of Hartford, after a careful
comparison with the Latin.

<span id="ii-p9"></span>The literary introduction of Dr. Hartranft, in
connection with the translator’s historical preface, will place the
reader in the situation of the controversy between the Catholic Church
and the Donatists at the time of St. Augustin.

<span id="ii-p10"></span>In both sections the treatises are arranged in
chronological order.

<span id="ii-p11"></span>The fifth volume will contain the writings of
St. Augustin against the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians.  It is in the
hands of the printer and will be published in October.

id="ii-p12.2"></span>Schaff</span>.

<span id="ii-p13"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii-p13.1"></span>New York</span>, June, 1887.
