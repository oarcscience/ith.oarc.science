<span id="v.iv.ix.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49.—</span>96.  Cyprian of
Carthage said:  "My opinion has been set forth with the greatest
fullness in the letter which has been written to our colleague
Jubaianus, <span id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891.md) that heretics
being called enemies of Christ and antichrists according to the
testimony of the gospel and the apostles, should, when they come to the
Church, be baptized with the one baptism of the Church, that from
enemies they may be made friends, and that from antichrists they may be
made Christians." <span id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892.md)

<span id="page_511">p. 511</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix.xlix-Page_511"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ix.xlix-p4"></span>97.  What need is there of further
disputation here, seeing that we have already handled with the utmost
care that very epistle to Jubaianus of which he has made mention?  And
as to what he has said here, let us not forget that it might be said of
all unrighteous men who, as he himself bears witness, are in the
Catholic Church, and whose power of possessing and of conferring baptism
is not questioned by any of us.  For they come to the Church, who pass
to Christ from the party of the devil, and build upon the rock, and are
incorporated with the Dove, and are placed in security in the garden
enclosed and fountain sealed; where none of those are found who live
contrary to the precepts of Christ, wherever they may seem to be.  For
in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, while discussing this very
question, he himself warned us at sufficient length, and in no ambiguous
terms, of what kind of society we should understand that the Church
consists.  For he says, in speaking of a certain man, "Let him become an
alien and profane, an enemy to the peace and unity of the Lord, not
dwelling in the house of God, that is to say, in the Church of Christ,
in which none dwell save those who are of one heart and of one
mind." <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893.md)   Let those,
therefore, who would lay injunctions on us on the authority of Cyprian,
pay attention for a time to what we here say.  For if only those who are
of one heart and of one mind dwell in the Church of Christ, beyond all
question those were not dwelling in the Church of Christ, however much
they might appear to be within, who of envy and contention were
announcing Christ without charity; by whom he understands, not the
heretics and schismatics who are mentioned by the Apostle Paul, <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md) but false brethren holding
conversation with him within, who certainly ought not to have baptized,
because they were not dwelling in the Church, in which he himself says
that none dwell save those who are of one heart and of one mind: 
unless, indeed, any one be so far removed from the truth as to say that
those were of one heart and of one mind who were envious and malevolent,
and contentious without charity; and yet they used to baptize:  nor did
the detestable waywardness which they displayed in any degree violate or
diminish from the sacrament of Christ, which was handled and dispensed
by them.
