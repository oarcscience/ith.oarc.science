<span id="v.iv.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—</span>12.  In short, we may
see how great an evil in itself is envy, which cannot be other than
malicious.  Let us not look for other testimony.  Cyprian himself is
sufficient for us, through whose mouth the Lord poured forth so many
thunders in most perfect truth, and uttered so many useful precepts
about envy and malignity.  Let us therefore read the letter of Cyprian
about envy and malignity, and see how great an evil it is to envy those
better than ourselves,—an evil whose origin he shows in memorable words
to have sprung from the devil himself.  "To feel jealousy," he says, "of
what you regard as good, and to envy those who are better than
yourselves, to some, dearest brethren, seems a light and minute
offense." <span id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371)   And again a
little later, when he was inquiring into the source and origin of the
evil, he says, "From this the devil, in the very beginning of the world,
perished first himself, and led others to destruction." <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372)   And further on in the same
chapter:  "What an evil, dearest brethren, is that by which an angel
fell! by which that exalted and illustrious loftiness was able to be
deceived and overthrown! by which he was deceived who was the deceiver! 
From that time envy stalks upon the earth, when man, about to perish
through malignity, submits himself to the teacher of perdition,—when he
who envies imitates the devil, as it is written, ‘Through envy of the
devil came death into the world, and they that do hold of his side do
find it.’" <span id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373)   How true, how
forcible are these words of Cyprian, in an epistle known throughout the
world, we cannot fail to recognize.  It was truly fitting for <span
id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.viii-Page_452"></span>Cyprian to argue and warn most
forcibly about envy and malignity, from which most deadly evil he proved
his own heart to be so far removed by the abundance of his Christian
love; by carefully guarding which he remained in the unity of communion
with his colleagues, who without ill-feeling entertained different views
about baptism, whilst he himself differed in opinion from them, not
through any contention of ill will, but through human infirmity, erring
in a point which God, in His own good time, would reveal to him by
reason of his perseverance in love.  For he says openly, "Judging no
one, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ from us. 
For no one of us setteth himself up as a bishop of bishops, or by
tyrannical terror forces his colleagues to a necessity of obeying."
 <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374)   And in the end of the
epistle before us he says, "These things I have written to you briefly,
dearest brother, according to my poor ability, prescribing to or
prejudging no one, so as to prevent each bishop from doing what he
thinks right in the free exercise of his own judgment.  We, so far as in
us lies, do not strive on behalf of heretics with our colleges and
fellow-bishops, with whom we hold the harmony that God enjoins, and the
peace of our Lord, especially as the apostle says, ‘If any man seem to
be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of
God.’ <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375)   Christian love in our
souls, the honor of our fraternity, the bond of faith, the harmony of
the priesthood, all these are maintained by us with patience and
gentleness.  For this cause we have also, so far as our poor ability
admitted, by the permission and inspiration of the Lord, written now a
treatise on the benefit of patience, <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376) which we have sent to you in
consideration of our mutual affection." <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377)
