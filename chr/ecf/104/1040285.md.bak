<span id="v.iv.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—</span>10.  Zosimus also of
Tharassa said:  "When a revelation of the truth has been made, error
must give way to truth; for even Peter, who at the first circumcised,
afterwards gave way to Paul when he declared the truth." <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md)   He indeed chose to say error, not
custom; but in saying "for even Peter, who at the first circumcised,
afterwards gave way to Paul when he declared the truth," he shows
plainly enough that there was a custom also on the subject of baptism at
variance with his views.  At the same time, also, he warns us that it
was not impossible that Cyprian might have held an opinion about baptism
at variance with that required by the truth, as held by the Church both
before and after him, if even Peter could hold a view at variance with
the truth as taught us by the Apostle Paul. <span
