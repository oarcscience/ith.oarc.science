<span id="v.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>35.  As to the charge that
they bring against us, that we covet and plunder their possessions, I
would that they would become Catholics, and possess in peace and love
with us, not only what they call theirs, but also what confessedly
belongs to us.  But they are so blinded with the desire of uttering
calumnies, that they do not observe how inconsistent their statements
are with one another.  At any rate, they assert, and seem to make it a
subject of most invidious complaint among themselves, that we constrain
them to come in to our communion by the violent authority of the
laws,—which we certainly should not do by any means, if we wished to
gain possession of their property.  What avaricious man ever wished for
another to share his possessions?  Who that was inflamed with the desire
of empire, or elated by the pride of its possession, ever wished to have
a partner?  Let them at any rate look on those very men who once
belonged to them, but now are our brethren joined to us by the bond of
fraternal affection, and see how they hold not only what they used to
have, but also what was ours, which they did not have before; which yet,
if we are living as poor in fellowship with poor, belongs to us and them
alike; whilst, if we possess of our private means enough for our wants,
it is no longer ours, inasmuch as we do not commit so infamous an act of
usurpation as to claim for our own the property of the poor, for whom we
are in some sense the trustees.

<span id="v.vi.xi-p2"></span>36.  Everything, therefore, that was held
in the name of the churches of the party of Donatus, was ordered by the
Christian emperors, in their pious laws, to pass to the Catholic Church,
with the possession of the buildings themselves. <span
id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528.md)   Seeing, then, that there are with
us poor members of those said churches who used to be maintained by
these same paltry possessions, let them rather cease themselves to covet
what belongs to others whilst they remain outside, and so let them enter
within the bond of unity, that we may all alike administer, not only the
property which they call their own, but also with it what is asserted to
be ours.  For it is written "All are yours; and ye are Christ’s; and
Christ is God’s." <span id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529.md)   Under Him
as our Head, let us all be one in His one body; and in all such matters
as you speak of, let us follow the example which is recorded in the Acts
of the Apostles:  "They were of one heart and of one soul:  neither said
any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but
they had all things common." <span id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530.md)
  Let us love what we sing:  "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
for brethren to dwell together in unity!" <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531.md) that so they may know, by their own
experience, with what perfect truth their mother, the Catholic Church,
calls out to them what the blessed apostle writes to the Corinthians: 
"I seek not yours, but you." <span id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532.md)

<span id="v.vi.xi-p8"></span>37.  But if we consider what is said in the
Book of Wisdom, "Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly;" <span
id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533.md) and also what is said in the
Proverbs, "The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just;" <span
id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534.md) then we shall see that the question
is not, who are in possession of the property of the heretics? but who
are in the society of the just?  We know, indeed, that the Donatists
arrogate to themselves such a store of justice, that they boast not only
that they possess it, but that they also bestow it upon other men.  For
they say that any one whom they have baptized is justified by them,
after which there is nothing left for them but to say to the person who
is baptized by them that he must needs believe on him who has
administered the sacrament; for why should he not do so, when the
apostle says, "To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly,
his faith is counted for righteousness?" <span
id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535.md)   Let him believe, therefore, upon
the man by whom he is baptized, if it be none else that justifies him,
that his faith may be counted for righteousness.  But I think that even
they themselves would look with horror on themselves, if they ventured
for a moment to entertain such thoughts as these.  For there is none
that is just and able to justify, save God alone.  But the same might be
said of <span id="page_647">p. 647</span> <span
id="v.vi.xi-Page_647"></span>them that the apostle says of the Jews,
that "being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to
establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves
unto the righteousness of God." <span
id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536.md)

<span id="v.vi.xi-p13"></span>38.  But far be it from us that any one of
our number should call himself in such wise just, that he should either
go about to establish his own righteousness, as though it were conferred
upon him by himself, whereas it is said to him, "For what hast thou that
thou didst not receive?" <span id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537.md) or
venture to boast himself as being without sin in this world, as the
Donatists themselves declared in our conference that they were members
of a Church which has already neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such
thing, <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538.md) —not knowing that this
is only fulfilled in those individuals who depart out of this body
immediately after baptism, or after the forgiveness of sins, for which
we make petition in our prayers; but that for the Church, as a whole,
the time will not come when it shall be altogether without spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing, till the day when we shall hear the words,
"O death, where is thy sting?  O grave, where is thy victory?  The sting
of death is sin."  <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539.md)

<span id="v.vi.xi-p17"></span>39.  But in this life, when the
corruptible body presseth down the soul, <span
id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540.md) if their Church is already of such
a character as they maintain, they would not utter unto God the prayer
which our Lord has taught us to employ:  "Forgive us our debts." <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541.md)   For since all sins have been
remitted in baptism, why does the Church make this petition, if already,
even in this life, it has neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing? 
They would also have a fight to despise the warning of the Apostle John,
when he cries out in his epistle, "If we say that we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  But if we confess our
sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness." <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md)  
On account of this hope, the universal Church utters the petition,
"Forgive us our debts," that when He sees that we are not vainglorious,
but ready to confess our sins, He may cleanse us from all
unrighteousness, and that so the Lord Jesus Christ may show to Himself
in that day a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing, which now He cleanses with the washing of water in the word: 
because, on the one hand, there is nothing that remains behind in
baptism to hinder the forgiveness of every bygone sin (so long, that is,
as baptism is not received to no effect without the Church, but is
either administered within the Church, or, at least, if it has been
already administered without, the recipient does not remain outside with
it); and, on the other hand, whatever pollution of sin, of whatsoever
kind, is contracted through the weakness of human nature by those who
live here after baptism, is cleansed away in virtue of the same laver’s
efficacy.  For neither is it of any avail for one who has not been
baptized to say, "Forgive us our debts."

<span id="v.vi.xi-p21"></span>40.  Accordingly, He so now cleanses His
Church by the washing of water in the word, that He may hereafter show
it to Himself as not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing,—altogether beautiful, that is to say, and in absolute perfection,
when death shall be "swallowed up in victory." <span
id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md)   Now, therefore, in so far as the
life is flourishing within us that proceeds from our being born of God,
living by faith, so far we are righteous; but in so far as we drag along
with us the traces of our mortal nature as derived from Adam, so far we
cannot be free from sin.  For there is truth both in the statement that
"whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin," <span
id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544.md) and also in the former statement,
that "if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us." <span id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md)   The Lord
Jesus, therefore, is both righteous and able to justify; but we are
justified freely by no other grace than His. <span
id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md)   For there is nothing that
justifieth save His body, which is the Church; and therefore, if the
body of Christ bears off the spoils of the unrighteous, and the riches
of the unrighteous are laid up in store as treasures for the body of
Christ, the unrighteous ought not therefore to remain outside, but
rather to enter within, that so they may be justified.

<span id="v.vi.xi-p26"></span>41.  Whence also we may be sure that what
is written concerning the day of judgment, "Then shall the righteous man
stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him,
and made no account of his labors," <span
id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547.md) is not to be taken in such a sense
as that the Canaanite shall stand before the face of Israel, though
Israel made no account of the labors of the Canaanite; but only as that
Naboth shall stand before the face of Ahab, since Ahab made no account
of the labors of Naboth, since the Canaanite was unrighteous, while
Naboth was a righteous man.  In the same way the heathen shall not stand
before the face of the Christian, who made no account of his labors,
when the temples of the idols were plundered and destroyed; but the
Christian shall stand before <span id="page_648">p. 648</span> <span
id="v.vi.xi-Page_648"></span>the face of the heathen, who made no
account of his labors, when the bodies of the martyrs were laid low in
death.  In the same way, therefore, the heretic shall not stand in the
face of the Catholic, who made no account of his labors, when the laws
of the Catholic emperors were put in force; but the Catholic shall stand
in the face of the heretic, who made no account of his labors when the
madness of the ungodly Circumcelliones was allowed to have its way.  For
the passage of Scripture decides the question in itself, seeing that it
does not say, Then shall men stand, but "Then shall the righteous
stand;" and they shall stand "in great boldness" because they stand in
the power of a good conscience.

<span id="v.vi.xi-p28"></span>42.  But in this world no one is righteous
by his own righteousness,—that is, as though it were wrought by himself
and for himself; but as the apostle says, "According as God hath dealt
to every man the measure of faith."  But then he goes on to add the
following:  "For as we have many members in one body, and all members
have not the same office; so we, being many, are one body in
Christ." <span id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md)   And according to
this doctrine, no one can be righteous so long as he is separated from
the unity of this body.  For in the same manner as if a limb be cut off
from the body of a living man, it cannot any longer retain the spirit of
life; so the man who is cut off from the body of Christ, who is
righteous, can in no wise retain the spirit of righteousness, even if he
retain the form of membership which he received when in the body.  Let
them therefore come into the framework of this body, and so possess
their own labors, not through the lust of lordship, but through the
godliness of using them aright.  But we, as has been said before,
cleanse our wills from the pollution of this concupiscence, even in the
judgment of any enemy you please to name as judge, seeing that we use
our utmost efforts in entreating the very men of whose labors we avail
ourselves to enjoy with us, within the society of the Catholic Church,
the fruits both of their labors and of our own.
