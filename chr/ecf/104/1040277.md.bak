<span id="v.iv.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15</span>.—20.  Since the Catholic
Church, both in the time of the blessed Cyprian and in the older time
before him, contained within her bosom either some that were rebaptized
or some that were unbaptized, either the one section or the other must
have won their salvation only by the force of simple unity.  For if
those who came over from the heretics were not baptized, as Cyprian
asserts, they were not rightly admitted into the Church; and yet he
himself did not despair of their obtaining pardon from the mercy of God
in virtue of the unity of the Church.  So again, if they were already
baptized, it was not right to rebaptize them.  What, therefore, was
there to aid the other section, save the same charity that delighted in
unity, so that what was hidden from man’s weakness, in the consideration
of the sacrament, might not be reckoned, by the mercy of God, as a fault
in those who were lovers of peace?  Why, then, while ye fear those whom
ye have rebaptized, do ye grudge yourselves and them the entrance to
salvation?  There was at one time a doubt upon the subject of baptism;
those who held different opinions yet remained in unity.  In course of
time, owing to the certain discovery of the truth, that doubt was taken
away.  The question which, unsolved, did not frighten Cyprian into
separation from the Church, invites you, now that it is solved, to
return once more within the fold.  Come to the Catholic Church in its
agreement, which Cyprian did not desert while yet disturbed with doubt;
or if now you are dissatisfied with the example of Cyprian, who held
communion with those who were received with the baptism of heretics,
declaring openly that we should "neither judge any one, nor deprive any
one of the right of communion if he differ from us," <span

<span id="v.iv.iv.xv-Page_435"></span>whither are ye going, ye wretched
men?  What are ye doing?  You are bound to fly even from yourselves,
because you have advanced beyond the position where he abode.  But if
neither his own sins nor those of others could stand in his way, on
account of the abundance of his charity and his love of brotherly
kindness and the bond of peace, do you return to us, where you will find
much less hindrance in the way of either us or you from the fictions
which your party have invented.
