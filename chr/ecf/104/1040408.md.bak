<span id="v.iv.ix.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>16.  Jader of Midila <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md) said:  "We know that there is but
one baptism in the Catholic Church, and therefore we ought not <span
id="page_503">p. 503</span> <span id="v.iv.ix.ix-Page_503"></span>to
admit a heretic unless he has been baptized in our body, lest he should
think that he has been baptized outside the Catholic Church." <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.ix-p4"></span>17.  To him our answer is, that if this
were said of those unrighteous men who are outside the rock, it
certainly would be falsely said.  And so it is therefore also in the
case of heretics.
