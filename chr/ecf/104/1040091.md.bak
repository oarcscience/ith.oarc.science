<span id="iv.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Sin is Only from the Will.  His
Own Life and Will Best Known to Each Individual.  What Will is.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.xi-p2"></span>For let any men whatever, if only no
madness has broken them loose from the common <span id="page_102">p.
102</span> <span id="iv.vi.xi-Page_102"></span>sense of the human race,
bring whatever zeal they like for judging, whatever ignorance, nay
whatever slowness of mind, I should like to find out what they would
have replied to me had I asked, whether a man would seem to them to have
sinned by whose hand while he was asleep another should have written
something disgraceful?  Who doubts that they would have denied that it
is a sin, and have exclaimed against it so vehemently that they might
perchance have been enraged that I should have thought them proper
objects of such a question?  Of whom reconciled and restored to
equanimity, as best I could do it, I should have begged that they would
not take it amiss if I asked them another thing just as manifest, just
as completely within the knowledge of all.  Then I should have asked, if
some stronger person had done some evil thing by the hand of one not
sleeping but conscious, yet with the rest of his members bound and in
constraint, whether because he knew it, though absolutely unwilling, he
should be held guilty of any sin?  And here all marvelling that I should
ask such questions, would reply without hesitation, that he had
absolutely not sinned at all.  Why so?  Because whoever has done
anything evil by means of one unconscious or unable to resist, the
latter can by no means be justly condemned.  And precisely why this is
so, if I should inquire of the human nature in these men, I should
easily bring out the desired answer, by asking in this manner:  Suppose
that the sleeper already knew what the other would do with his hand, and
of purpose aforethought, having drunk so much as would prevent his being
awakened, should go to sleep, in order to deceive some one with an
oath.  Would any amount of sleep suffice to prove his innocence?  What
else than a guilty man would one pronounce him?  But if he has also
willingly been bound that he may deceive some one by this pretext, in
what respect then would those chains profit as a means of relieving him
of sin?  Although bound by these he was really not able to resist, as in
the other case the sleeper was absolutely ignorant of what he was then
doing.  Is there therefore any possibility of doubting that both should
be judged to have sinned?  Which things having been conceded, I should
have argued, that sin is indeed nowhere but in the will, <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) since this consideration also would
have helped me, that justice holds guilty those sinning by evil will
alone, although they may have been unable to accomplish what they
willed.

<span id="iv.vi.xi-p5"></span>13.  For who could have said that, in
adducing these considerations, I was dwelling upon obscure and recondite
things, where on account of the fewness of those able to understand,
either fraud or suspicion of ostentation is accustomed to arise?  Let
that distinction between intelligible and sensible things withdraw for a
little:  let me not be found fault with for following up slow minds with
the stimuli of subtle disputations.  Permit me to know that I live,
permit me to know that I will to live.  If in this the human race
agrees, as our life is known to us, so also is our will.  Nor when we
become possessed of this knowledge, is there any occasion to fear lest
any one should convince us that we may be deceived; for no one can be
deceived as to whether he does not live, or wishes nothing.  I do not
think that I have adduced anything obscure, and my concern is rather
lest some should find fault with me for dwelling on things that are too
manifest.  But let us consider the bearing of these things.

<span id="iv.vi.xi-p6"></span>14.  Sinning therefore takes place only by
exercise of will.  But our will is very well known to us; for neither
should I know that I will, if I did not know what will itself is. 
Accordingly, it is thus defined:  will is a movement of mind, no one
compelling, either <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span
id="iv.vi.xi-Page_103"></span>for not losing or for obtaining
something. <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)   Why therefore could
not I have so defined it then?  Was it difficult to see that one
unwilling is contrary to one willing, just as the left hand is contrary
to the right, not as black to white?  For the same thing cannot be at
the same time black and white.  But whoever is placed between two men is
on the left hand with reference to one, on the right with reference to
the other.  One man is both on the right hand and on the left hand at
the same time, but by no means both to the one man.  So indeed one mind
may be at the same time unwilling and willing, but it cannot be at the
same time unwilling and willing with reference to one and the same
thing.  For when any one unwillingly does anything; if you ask him
whether he wished to do it, he says that he did not.  Likewise if you
ask whether he wished not to do it, he replies that he did.  So you will
find him unwilling with reference to doing, willing with reference to
not doing, that is to say, one mind at the same time having both
attitudes, but each referring to different things.  Why do I say this? 
Because if we should again ask wherefore though unwilling he does this,
he will say that he is compelled.  For every one also who does a thing
unwillingly is compelled, and every one who is compelled, if he does a
thing, does it only unwillingly.  It follows that he that is willing is
free from compulsion, even if any one thinks himself compelled.  And in
this manner every one who willingly does a thing is not compelled, and
whoever is not compelled, either does it willingly or not at all.  Since
nature itself proclaims these things in all men whom we can interrogate
without absurdity, from the boy even to the old man, from literary sport
even to the throne of the wise, why then should I not have seen that in
the definition of will should be put, "no one compelling," which now as
if with greater experience most cautiously I have done.  But if this is
everywhere manifest, and promptly occurs to all not by instruction but
by nature, what is there left that seems obscure, unless perchance it be
concealed from some one, that when we wish for something, we will, and
our mind is moved towards it, and we either have it or do not have it,
and if we have it we will to retain it, if we have it not, to acquire
it?  Wherefore everyone who wills, wills either not to lose something or
to obtain it.  Hence if all these things are clearer than day, as they
are, nor are they given to my conception alone, but by the liberality of
truth itself to the whole human race, why could I not have said even at
that time:  Will is a movement of the mind, no one compelling, either
for not losing or for obtaining something?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_209"></span>[102:210](1040091.htm#fr_209.md) <span
id="iv.vi.xi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.xi-p3"></span> The Pelagians used this statement with
considerable effect in their polemics against its author.  In his
*Retractations* Augustin has this to say by way of explanation:  "The
Pelagians may think that thus was said in their interest, on account of
young children whose sin which is remitted to them in baptism they deny
on the ground that they do not yet use the power of will.  As if indeed
the sin, which we say they derive originally from Adam, that is, that
they are implicated in his guilt and on this account are held obnoxious
to punishment, could ever be otherwise than in will, by which will it
was committed when the transgression of the divine precept was
accomplished.  Our statement, that ‘there is never sin but in will,’ may
be thought false for the reason that the apostle says:  ‘If what I will
not this I do, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
me.’  For this sin is to such an extent involuntary, that he says: 
‘What I will not this I do.’  How, therefore, is there never sin but in
the will?  But this sin concerning which the apostle has spoken is
called sin, because by sin it was done, and it is the penalty of sin;
since this is said concerning carnal concupiscence, which he discloses
in what follows saying:  ‘I know that in me, that is in my flesh,
dwelleth no good; for to will is present to me, but to accomplish that
which is good, is not.’ ([Rom. vii.
16-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.vi.xi-p3.1"></span>).  Since the perfection of good is, that not
even the concupiscence of sin should be in man, to which indeed when one
lives well the will does not consent; nevertheless man does not
accomplish the good because as yet concupiscence is in him, to which the
will is antagonistic, the guilt of which concupiscence is loosed by
baptism, but the infirmity remains, against which until it is healed
every believer who advances well most earnestly struggles.  But sin,
which is never but in will, must especially be known as that which is
followed by just condemnation.  For this through one man entered into
the world; although that sin also by which consent is yielded to
concupiscence is not committed but by will.  Wherefore also in another
place I have said:  ‘Not therefore except by will is sin
committed.’"—A.H.N.

<span id="iv.vi.xi-p4"></span>On this matter Augustin’s still earlier
treatise *De Libero Arbitrio*, and his interesting *Retractations* on
the same, should be compared.  The reader of these earlier treatises in
comparison with the Anti-Pelagian treatises can hardly fail to recognize
a marked change of base on Augustin’s part.  His efforts to show the
consistency of his earlier with his later modes of thought are to be
pronounced only partially successful.  The fact is, that in the
Anti-Manichæan time he went too far in maintaining the absolute freedom
of the will and the impossibility of sin apart from personal will in the
sinner; while in the Anti-Pelagian time he ventured too near to the
fatalism that he so earnestly combated in the Manichæans.—A.H.N.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[103:211](1040091.htm#fr_210.md) <span
id="iv.vi.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.xi-p7"></span> This dictum also Augustin thought it
needful to explain:  "This was said that by this definition a willing
person might be distinguished from one not willing, and so the intention
might be referred to those who first in Paradise were the origin of evil
to the human race, by sinning no one compelling, that is by sinning with
free will, because also knowingly they sinned against the command, and
the tempters persuaded, did not compel, that this should be done.  For
he who ignorantly sinned may not incongruously be said to have sinned
unwillingly, although not knowing what he did, yet willingly he did it. 
So not even the sin of such a one could be without will, which will
assuredly, as it has been defined, was a ‘movement of the mind, no one
compelling, either for not losing or for obtaining something.’  For he
was not compelled to do what if he had been unwilling he would not have
done.  Because he willed, therefore he did it, even if he did not sin
because he willed, being ignorant that what he did is sin.  So not even
such a sin could be without will, but by will of deed not by will of
sin, which deed was yet sin; for this deed is what ought not to have
taken place.  But whoever knowingly sins, if he can without sin resist
the one compelling him to sin, yet resists not, assuredly sins
willingly.  For he who can resist is not compelled to yield.  But he who
cannot by good will resist cogent covetousness, and therefore does what
is contrary to the precepts of righteousness, this now is sin in the
sense of being the penalty of sin.  Wherefore it is most true that sin
cannot be apart from will."

<span id="iv.vi.xi-p8"></span>It is needless to say that such reasoning
would not have answered Augustin’s purpose in writing against the
Manichæans.—A.H.N.
