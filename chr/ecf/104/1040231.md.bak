id="iv.x.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47.—He Compels to the Perpetration of
Horrible Turpitudes.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xlix-p2"></span>O abominable monster!  O execrable
perdition and ruin of deluded souls!  I am not speaking of the blasphemy
of saying these things about the nature of God which is thus fettered. 
Let the wretches deluded and hunted by deadly error give heed to this at
least, that if a part of their God is fettered by the copulation of
males and females which they profess to loose and purge by eating it,
the necessity of this unspeakable error compels them not only to loose
and purge the part of God from bread and vegetables and fruits, which
alone they are seen publicly to partake of, but also from that which
might be fettered through copulation, if conception should take place. 
That they do this some are said to have confessed before a public
tribunal, not only in Paphlagonia, but also in Gaul, as I heard in Rome
from a certain Catholic Christian; and when they were asked by the
authority of what writing they did these things, they betrayed this fact
concerning the *Thesaurus* that I have just mentioned.  But when this is
cast in their teeth, they are in the habit of replying, that some enemy
or other has withdrawn from their number, that is from the number of
their Elect, and has made a schism, and has founded a most foul heresy
of this kind.  Whence it is manifest that even if they do not themselves
practise this thing, some who do practise it do it on the basis of their
books.  Therefore let them reject the books, if they abhor the crime,
which they are compelled to commit, if they hold to the books; or if
they do not commit them, they endeavor in opposition to the books to
live more purely.  But what do they do when it is said to them, either
purge the light from whatever seeds you can, so that you cannot refuse
to do that which you assert that you do not do; or else anathematize
Manichæus, when he says that a part of God is in all seeds, and that it
is fettered by copulation, but that whatever of light, that is, of the
aforesaid part of God, should become the food of the Elect, is purged by
being eaten.  Do you see what he compels you to believe, and do you
still hesitate to anathematize him?  What do they do, I say, when this
is said to them?  To what subterfuges do they betake themselves, when
either so nefarious a doctrine is to be anathematized, or so nefarious a
turpitude committed, in comparison with which all those intolerable
evils to which I have already called attention, seem tolerable, namely,
that they say of the nature of God that it was pressed by necessity to
wage war, that it was either secure by everlasting ignorance, or was
disturbed by everlasting grief and fear, when the corruption of
commingling and the chain of everlasting damnation should come upon it,
that finally as a result of the conflict it should be taken captive,
oppressed, polluted, that after a false victory it should be fettered
forever in a horrible sphere and separated from its original
blessedness, while if considered in themselves they cannot be endured?
