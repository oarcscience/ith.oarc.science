<span id="v.v.v.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—</span>24.  But see, when he is
reduced to straits in the argument, he again makes an attack on me full
of mist and wind, that the calm clearness of the truth may be obscured;
and through the extremity of his want he becomes full of resources,
shown not in saying what is true, but in unbought empty revilings.  Hold
fast, with the keenest attention and utmost perseverance, what he ought
to answer,—that is, where means may be found for cleansing the
conscience of the recipient when the stains in that of the giver are
concealed,—lest possibly the blast of his <span id="page_606">p.
606</span> <span id="v.v.v.xxi-Page_606"></span>eloquence should wrest
this from your hands, and you in turn should be carried away by the dark
tempest of his turgid discourse, so as wholly to fail in seeing whence
he has digressed, and to what point he should return; and see where the
man can wander, whilst he cannot stand in the matter which he has
undertaken.  For see how much he says, through having nothing that he
ought to say.  He says "that I slide in slippery places, but am held up;
that I neither destroy nor confirm the objections that I make; that I
devise uncertain things in the place of certainty; that I do not permit
my readers to believe what is true, but cause them to look with
increased suspicion on what is doubtful."  He says "that I have the
accursed talents of the Academic philosopher Carneades." <span
id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md)   He endeavors to insinuate what
the Academics think of the falseness or the falsehood of human
sensation, showing in this also that he is wholly without knowledge of
what he says.  He declares that "it is said by them that snow is black,
whereas it is white; and that silver is black; and that a tower is
round, or free from projections, when it is really angular; that an oar
is broken in the water, while it is whole." <span
id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md)   And all this because, when he had
said that "the conscience of him that gives," or "of him that gives in
holiness, is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the
recipient," I said in reply, What if the conscience of the giver be
hidden from sight, and possibly be stained with guilt?  Here you have
his black snow, and black silver, and his tower round instead of
angular, and the oar in the water broken while yet whole, in that I
suggested a state of the case which might be conceived, and could not
really exist, that the conscience of the giver might be hidden from
view, and possibly might be stained with guilt!

<span id="v.v.v.xxi-p4"></span>25.  Then he continues in the same
strain, and cries out:  "What is that *what if?* what is that
*possibly?* except the uncertain and wavering hesitation of one who
doubts, of whom your poet says’—

<span id="v.v.v.xxi-p5"></span>‘What if I now return to those who say,
What if the sky should fall?’" <span
id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md)

<span id="v.v.v.xxi-p7"></span>Does he mean that when I said, What if
the conscience of the giver be hidden from sight, and possibly be
stained with guilt? that it is much the same as if I had said, What if
the sky should fall?  There certainly is the phrase What if, because it
is possible that it may be hidden from view, and it is possible that it
may not.  For when it is not known what the giver is thinking of, or
what crime he has committed, then his conscience is certainly hidden
from the view of the recipient; but when his sin is plainly manifest,
then it is not hidden.  I used the expression, And possibly may be
stained with guilt, because it is possible that it may be hidden from
view and yet be pure; and again, it is possible that it may be hidden
from view and be stained with guilt.  This is the meaning of the What
if; this the meaning of the Possibly.  Is this at all like "What if the
sky should fall?"  O how often have men been convicted, how often have
they confessed themselves that they had consciences stained with guilt
and adultery, whilst men were unwittingly baptized by them after they
were degraded by the sin subsequently brought to light, and yet the sky
did not fall!  What have we here to do with Pilus and Furius, <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md) who defended the cause of injustice
against justice?  What have we here to do with the atheist
Diagoras, <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) who denied that
there was any God, so that he would seem to be the man of whom the
prophet spoke beforehand, "The fool hath said in his heart there is no
God?" <span id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md)   What have we here to
do with these?  Why were their names brought in, except that they might
make a diversion in favor of a man who had nothing to say? that while he
is at any rate saying something, though needlessly, about these, the
matter in hand may seem to be progressing, and an answer may be supposed
to be made to a question which remains without an answer?

<span id="v.v.v.xxi-p2"></span> Lactantius, *Divin. Instit*. Book V. c.
xv., tells us of the talents of Carneades, recording that when he was
sent on an embassy to Rome by the Athenians, he spoke there first in
defense of justice, and then on the following day in opposition to it;
and that he was in the habit of speaking with such force on either side,
as to be able to refute any arguments advanced by anybody else.

<span id="v.v.v.xxi-p8"></span> In *de Civ. Dei*, Book II. c. xxi.,
Augustin mentions L. Furius Philus, one of the interlocutors in Cicero’s
*Laelius*, as maintaining this same view.  From the similarity of the
name, it has been thought that here Furius and Pilus are only one man.
