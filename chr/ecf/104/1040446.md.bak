<span id="v.iv.ix.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47.—</span>92.  Natalis of
Oëa <span id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) said:  "It is not only I
myself who am present, but also Pompeius of Sabrati, <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886.md) and Dioga of Leptis Magna, <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887.md) who commissioned me to represent
their views, being absent indeed in body, but present in spirit, who
deliver this same judgment as our colleagues, that heretics cannot have
communion with us, unless they have been baptized with the baptism of
the Church." <span id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xlvii-p6"></span>93.  He means, I suppose, that
communion which belongs to the society of the Dove; for in the partaking
of the sacraments they doubtless held communion with them, judging no
man, nor removing any from the right of communion if he held a different
opinion.  But with whatever reference he spoke, there is no great need
for these words being refuted.  For certainly a heretic would not be
admitted to communion, unless he had been baptized with the baptism of
the Church.  But it is clear that the baptism of the Church exists even
among heretics if it be consecrated with the words of the gospel; just
as the gospel itself belongs to the Church, and has nothing to do with
their waywardness, but certainly retains its own holiness.
