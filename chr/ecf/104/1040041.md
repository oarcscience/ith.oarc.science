id="iv.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—We are Required to Despise All
Sensible Things, and to Love God Alone.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxii-p2"></span>37.  Bodily delights have their source
in all those things with which the bodily sense comes in contact, and
which are by some called the objects of sense; and among these the
noblest is light, in the common meaning of the word, because among our
senses also, which the mind uses in acting through the body, there is
nothing more valuable than the eyes, and so in the Holy Scriptures all
the objects of sense are spoken of as visible things.  Thus in the New
Testament we are warned against the love of these things in the
following words:  "While we look not at the things which are seen, but
at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are
temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal." <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md)   This shows how far from being
Christians those are who hold that the sun and moon are to be not only
loved but worshipped.  For what is seen if the sun and moon are not? 
But we are forbidden to regard things which are seen.  The man,
therefore, who wishes to offer that incorrupt love to God must not love
these things too.  This subject I will inquire into more particularly
elsewhere.  Here my plan is to write not of faith, but of the life by
which we become worthy of knowing what we believe.  God then alone is to
be loved; and all this world, that is, all sensible things, are to be
despised,—while, however, they are to be used as this life requires.
