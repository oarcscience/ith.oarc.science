<span id="v.iv.vi.iii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—</span>4.  And if they would
have obeyed him, and begun to live rightly, not as <span
id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.iii-Page_448"></span>false
but as true Christians, would he have ordered them to be baptized anew? 
Surely not; but their true conversion would have gained this for them,
that the sacrament which availed for their destruction while they were
yet unchanged, should begin when they changed to avail for their
salvation.

<span id="v.iv.vi.iii-p2"></span>5.  For neither are they "devoted to
the Church" <span id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342) who seem to be
within and live contrary to Christ, that is, act against His
commandments; nor can they be considered in any way to belong to that
Church, which He so purifies by the washing of water, "that He may
present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any
such thing." <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343)   But if they
are not in that Church to whose members they do not belong, they are not
in the Church of which it is said, "My dove is but one; she is the only
one of her mother;" <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344) for she
herself is without spot or wrinkle.  Or else let him who can assert that
those are members of this dove who renounce the world in words but not
in deeds.  Meantime there is one thing which we see, from which I think
it was said, "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the
Lord," <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345) for God judgeth every
day.  For, according to His foreknowledge, who knows whom He has
foreordained before the foundation of the world to be made like to the
image of His Son, many who are even openly outside, and are called
heretics, are better than many good Catholics.  For we see what they are
to-day, what they shall be to-morrow we know not.  And with God, with
whom the future is already present, they already are what they shall
hereafter be.  But we, according to what each man is at present, inquire
whether they are to be to-day reckoned among the members of the Church
which is called the one dove, and the Bride of Christ without a spot or
wrinkle, <span id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346) of whom Cyprian says
in the letter which I have quoted above, that "they did not keep in the
way of the Lord, nor observe the commandments given unto them for their
salvation; that they did not fulfill the will of their Lord, being eager
about their property and gains, following the dictates of pride, giving
way to envy and dissension, careless about single-mindedness and faith,
renouncing the world in words only and not in deeds, pleasing each
himself, and displeasing all men." <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347)   But if the dove does not
acknowledge them among her members, and if the Lord shall say to them,
supposing that they continue in the same perversity, "I never knew you: 
depart from me, ye that work iniquity;" <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348) then they seem indeed to be in the
Church, but are not; "nay, they even act against the Church.  How then
can they baptize with the baptism of the Church," <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349) which is of avail neither to
themselves, nor to those who receive it from them, unless they are
changed in heart with a true conversion, so that the sacrament itself,
which did not avail them when they received it whilst they were
renouncing the world in words and not in deeds, may begin to profit them
when they shall begin to renounce it in deeds also?  And so too in the
case of those whose separation from the Church is open; for neither
these nor those are as yet among the members of the dove, but some of
them perhaps will be at some future time.
