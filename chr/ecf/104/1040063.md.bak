id="iv.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—The Difference Between What is Good
in Itself and What is Good by Participation.</span>

<span id="iv.v.vi-p2"></span>6.  Now, compare with this perplexity, from
which you cannot escape, the consistency of the statements in the
teaching of the Catholic Church, according to which there is one good
which is good supremely and in itself, and not by the participation of
any good, but by its own nature and essence; and another good which is
good by participation, and by having something bestowed.  Thus it has
its being as good from the supreme good, which, however, is still
self-contained, and loses nothing. <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="iv.v.vi-Page_71"></span>This second kind of good is called a
creature, which is liable to hurt through falling away.  But of this
falling away God is not the author, for He is author of existence and of
being.  Here we see the proper use of the word evil; for it is correctly
applied not to essence, but to negation or loss.  We see, too, what
nature it is which is liable to hurt.  This nature is not the chief
evil, for when it is hurt it loses good; nor is it the chief good, for
its falling away from good is because it is good not intrinsically, but
by possessing the good.  And a thing cannot be good by nature when it is
spoken of as being made, which shows that the goodness was bestowed. 
Thus, on the one hand, God is the good, and all things which He has made
are good, though not so good as He who made them.  For what madman would
venture to require that the works should equal the workman, the
creatures the Creator?  What more do you want?  Could you wish for
anything plainer than this?
