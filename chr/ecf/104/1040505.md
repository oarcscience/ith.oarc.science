<span id="v.v.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—</span>40.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xviii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Nor is it, after all, so strange that you assume to yourself the name
of bishop without authority.  This is the true custom of the devil, to
choose in preference a mode of deceiving by which he usurps to himself a
word of holy meaning, as the apostle declares to us:  ‘And no marvel,’
he says:  ‘for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as
the ministers of righteousness.’ <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018)   Nor is it therefore a marvel if
you falsely call yourself a bishop.  For even those fallen angels,
lovers of the maidens of the world, who were corrupted by the corruption
of their flesh, though, from having stripped themselves of divine
excellence, they have ceased <span id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.xviii-Page_539"></span>to be angels, yet retain the name of
angels, and always esteem themselves as angels, though, being released
from the service of God, they have passed from the likeness of their
character into the army of the devil, as the great God declares, ‘My
spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is
flesh.’ <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019)   To those guilty
ones and to you the Lord Christ will say, ‘Depart from me, ye cursed,
into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.’ <span
id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020)   If there were no evil angels, the
devil would have no angels; of whom the apostle says, that in the
judgment of the resurrection they shall be condemned by the saints: 
‘Know ye not,’ says he, ‘that we shall judge angels?’ <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021)   If they were true angels, men
would not have authority to judge the angels of God.  So too those sixty
apostles, who, when the twelve were left alone with the Lord Christ,
departed in apostasy from the faith, are so far yet considered among
wretched men to be apostles, that from them Manichæus and the rest
entangle many souls in many devilish sects which they destroyed <span
id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022) that they might take them in their
snares.  For indeed the fallen Manichæus, if fallen he was, is not to be
reckoned among those sixty, if it be that we can find his name as an
apostle among the twelve, or if he was ordained by the voice of Christ
when Matthias was elected into the place of the traitor Judas, or
another thirteenth like Paul, who calls himself the last <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023) of the apostles, expressly that any
one who was later than himself might not be held to be an apostle.  For
these are his words:  ‘For I am the last of the apostles, that am not
meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of
God.’ <span id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024)   And do not flatter
yourselves in this:  he was a Jew that had done this.  You too, as
Gentiles, may work destruction upon us.  For you carry on war without
license, against whom we may not fight in turn.  For you desire to live
when you have murdered us; but our victory is either to escape or to be
slain."

<span id="v.v.iv.xviii-p9"></span>41.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xviii-p9.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  See how you
have quoted the testimony of holy Scripture, or how you have understood
it, when it has no bearing at all upon the present point at issue.  For
all that you have brought forward was simply said to prove that there
are false bishops, just as there are false angels and false apostles. 
Now we too know quite well that there are false angels and false
apostles, and false bishops, and, as the true apostle says, false
brethren also; <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025) but, seeing
that charges such as yours may be brought by either side against the
other, what is required is a certain degree of proof, and not mere empty
words.  But if you would see to which of us the charge of falseness more
truly applies, recall to mind what we have said before, and you will see
it there set forth, that we may not become tedious to our readers by
repeating the same thing over and over again.  And yet how is the Church
dispersed throughout the world affected either by what you may have
found to say about its chaff, which is mixed with it throughout the
whole world; or by what you said of Manichæus and the other devilish
sects?  For if the wheat is not affected by anything which is said even
about the chaff which is still mingled with it, how much less are the
members of Christ dispersed throughout the whole world affected by
monstrosities <span id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026) which have been
so long and so openly separated from it? <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027)
