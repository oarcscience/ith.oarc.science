<span id="v.iv.vi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—</span>26.  Nor indeed, is it
of heresies alone that the apostle says "that they which do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God."  But it may be worth while to
look for a moment at the things which he groups together.  "The works of
the flesh," he says "are manifest, which are these; fornication,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
drunkenness, revellings, and such like:  of the which I tell you before,
as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God." <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md)   Let us suppose some one,
therefore, chaste, continent, free from covetousness, no idolater,
hospitable, charitable to the needy, no man’s enemy, not contentious,
patient, quiet, jealous of none, envying none, sober, frugal, but a
heretic; it is of course clear to all that for this one fault only, that
he is a heretic, he will fail to inherit the kingdom of God.  Let us
suppose another, a fornicator, unclean, lascivious, covetous, or even
more openly given to idolatry, a student of witchcraft, a lover of
strife and contention, envious, hot-tempered, seditious, jealous,
drunken, and a reveller, but a Catholic; can it be that for this sole
merit, that he is a Catholic, he will inherit the kingdom of God, though
his deeds are of the kind of which the apostle thus concludes:  "Of the
which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they
which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God?"  If we say
this, we lead ourselves astray.  For the word of God does not lead us
astray, which is neither silent, nor lenient, nor deceptive through any
flattery.  Indeed, it speaks to the same effect elsewhere:  "For this ye
know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which
is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God.  Let no man deceive you with vain words." <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md)   We have no reason, therefore, to
complain of the word of God.  It certainly says, and says openly and
freely, that those who live a wicked life have no part in the kingdom of
God.
