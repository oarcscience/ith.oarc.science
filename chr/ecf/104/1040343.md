<span id="v.iv.vii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—</span>24.  Whence Cyprian
himself <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) again admonishes us
with the greatest fullness, that many who were dead in their trespasses
and sins, although they did not belong to the body of Christ, and the
members of that innocent and guileless dove (so that if she alone
baptized, they certainly could not baptize), yet to all appearance
seemed both to be baptized and to baptize within the Church.  And among
them, however dead they are, their baptism nevertheless lives, which is
not dead, and death shall have no more dominion over it.  Since,
therefore, there be dead men within the Church, nor are they concealed,
for else Cyprian would not have spoken of them so much, who either do
not belong at all to that living dove, or at least do not as yet belong
to her; and since there be dead men without, who yet more clearly do not
belong to her at all, or not as yet; and since it is true that "another
man cannot be quickened by one who himself liveth not,"—it is therefore
clear that those who within are baptized by such persons, if they
approach the sacrament with true conversion of heart, are quickened by
Him whose baptism it is.  But if they renounce the world in word and not
in deed, as Cyprian declares to be the case with some who are within, it
is then manifest that they are not themselves quickened unless they be
converted, and yet that they have true baptism even though they be not
converted.  Whence also it is likewise clear that those who are dead
without, although they neither "live themselves, nor quicken others,"
yet have the living baptism, which would profit them unto life so soon
as they should be converted unto peace.
