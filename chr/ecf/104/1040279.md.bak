id="v.iv.v.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—</span>1.  I think that it may now
be considered clear to every one, that the authority of the blessed
Cyprian for the maintenance of the bond of peace, and the avoiding of
any violation of that most wholesome charity which preserves unity in
the Church, may be urged on our side rather than on the side of the
Donatists.  For if they have chosen to act upon his example in
rebaptizing Catholics, because he thought that heretics ought to be
baptized on joining the Catholic Church, shall not we rather follow his
example, whereby he laid down a manifest rule that one ought in no wise,
by the establishment of a separate communion, to secede from the
Catholic communion, that is, from the body of Christians dispersed
throughout the world, even on the admission of evil and sacrilegious
men, since he was unwilling even to remove from the right of communion
those whom he considered to have received sacrilegious men without
baptism into the Catholic communion, saying, "Judging no one, nor
depriving any of the right of communion if he differ from us?" <span
