<span id="v.iv.vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—</span>14.  Accordingly, I too
might use the words of the blessed Cyprian to turn the hearts of those
that hear me to the consideration of something truly marvellous, if I
were to say "that John, who was accounted greater among the prophets,—he
who was filled with divine grace while yet in his mother’s womb; he who
was upheld in the spirit and power of Elias; who was not the adversary,
but a forerunner and herald of the Lord:  who not only foretold our Lord
in words, but also showed Him to the sight; who baptized Christ Himself,
through whom all others are baptized," <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) —he was not worthy to baptize in
such wise that those who were baptized by him should not be baptized
again <span id="page_469">p. 469</span> <span
id="v.iv.vii.xii-Page_469"></span>after him; and shall no one think that
a man should be baptized in the Church after he had been baptized by the
covetous, by defrauders, by extortioners, by usurers?  Is not the answer
ready to this invidious question, Why do you think this unmeet, as
though either John were dishonored, or the covetous man honored?  But
His baptism ought not to be repeated, of whom John says, "The same is He
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost." <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md)   For whoever be the minister by
whose hands it is given, it is His baptism of whom it was said, "The
same is He which baptizeth."  But neither was the baptism of John
himself repeated, when the Apostle Paul commanded those who had been
baptized by him to be baptized in Christ.  For what they had not
received from the friend of the Bridegroom, this it was right that they
should receive from the Bridegroom Himself, of whom that friend had
said, "The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
