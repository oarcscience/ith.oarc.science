<span id="iv.ix.xiv"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Book XII.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p2"></span>Faustus denies that the prophets
predicted Christ.  Augustin proves such prediction from the New
Testament, and expounds at length the principal types of Christ in the
Old Testament.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  Why do I not believe
the prophets?  Rather why do you believe them?  On account, you will
reply, of their prophecies about Christ.  For my part, I have read the
prophets with the most eager attention, and have found no such
prophecies.  And surely it shows a weak faith not to believe in Christ
without proofs and testimonies.  Indeed, you yourselves are accustomed
to teach that Christian faith is so simple and absolute as not to admit
of laborious investigations.  Why, then, should you destroy the
simplicity of faith by buttressing it with evidences, and Jewish
evidences too?  Or if you are changing your opinion about evidences,
what more trustworthy witness could you have than God Himself testifying
to His own Son when He sent Him on earth,—not by a prophet or an
interpreter,—by a voice immediately from heaven:  "This is my beloved
Son, believe Him?" <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md)   And again
He testifies of Himself:  "I came forth from the Father, and am come
into the world;" <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) and in many
similar passages.  When the Jews quarrelled with this testimony, saying
"Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true," He replied: 
"Although I bear witness of myself, my witness is true.  It is written
in your law, The witness of two men is true.  I am one that bear witness
of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me." <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md)   He does not mention the prophets. 
Again He appeals to the testimony of His own works, saying, "If ye
believe not me, believe the works;" <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) not, "If ye believe not me, believe
the prophets."  Accordingly we require no testimonies concerning our
Saviour.  All we look for in the prophets is prudence and virtue, and a
good example, which, you are well aware, are not to be found in the
Jewish prophets.  This, no doubt, explains your referring me at once to
their predictions as a reason for believing them, without a word about
their actions.  This may be good policy, but it is not in harmony with
the declaration of Scripture, that it is impossible to gather grapes
from thorns, or figs from thistles.  This may serve meanwhile as a brief
and sufficient reply to the question, why we do not believe the
prophets.  The fact that they did not prophesy of Christ is abundantly
proved in the writings of our fathers.  I shall only add this, that if
the Hebrew prophets knew and preached Christ, and yet lived such vicious
lives, what Paul says of the wise men among the Gentiles might be
applied to them:  "Though they knew God, they glorified Him not as God,
nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened." <span id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md)  
You see the knowledge of great things is worth little, unless the life
corresponds.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p9"></span>2.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xiv-p9.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  The meaning of all
this is, that the Hebrew prophets foretold nothing of Christ, and that,
if they did, their predictions are of no use to us, and they themselves
did not live suitably to the dignity of such prophecies.  We must
therefore prove the fact of the prophecies; and their use for the truth
and steadfastness of our faith; and that the lives of the prophets were
in harmony with their words.  In this threefold discussion, it would
take a long time under the first head to quote from all the books the
passages in which Christ may be shown to have been predicted.  Faustus’
frivolity may be met effectually by the weight of one great authority. 
Although Faustus does not believe the prophets, he professes to believe
the apostles.  Above, as if to satisfy the doubts of some opponent, he
declares that he assuredly believes the Apostle Paul. <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md)   Let us then hear what Paul says of
the prophets.  His words are:  "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, <span
id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_184"></span>called
to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, which He had
promised before by His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His
Son, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh." <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md)   What more does Faustus wish?  Will
he maintain that the apostle is speaking of some other prophets, and not
of the Hebrew prophets?  In any case, the gospel spoken of as promised
was concerning the Son of God, who was made for Him of the seed of David
according to the flesh:  and to this gospel the apostle says that he was
separated.  So that the Manichæan heresy is opposed to faith in the
gospel, which teaches that the Son of God was made of the seed of David
according to the flesh.  Besides, there are many passages where the
apostle plainly testifies in behalf of the Hebrew prophets, with an
authority by which the necks of these proud Manichæans are broken.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p12"></span>3.  "I speak the truth in Christ," says
the apostle, "I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy
Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow of heart.  For I
could wish that myself were accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my
kinsmen according to the flesh:  who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth
the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the
law, and the service and the promises; whose are the fathers, and of
whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed
for ever." <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md)   Here is the most
abundant and express testimony and the most solemn commendation.  The
adoption here spoken of is evidently through the Son of God; as the
apostle says to the Galatians:  "In the fullness of time, God sent forth
His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them
that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of
sons." <span id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md)   And the glory spoken of
is chiefly that of which he says in the same Epistle to the Romans: 
"What advantage hath the Jew? or what profit is there in circumcision? 
Much every way:  chiefly, because unto them were committed the oracles
of God." <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md)   Can the Manichæans
tell us of any oracles of God committed to the Jews besides those of the
Hebrew prophets?  And why are the covenants said to belong especially to
the Israelites, but because not only was the Old Testament given to
them, but also the New was prefigured in the Old?  Our opponents often
display much ignorant ferocity in attacking the dispensation of the law
given to the Israelites, not understanding that God wishes us to be not
under the law, but under grace.  They are here answered by the apostle
himself, who, in speaking of the advantages of the Jews, mentions this
as one, that they had the giving of the law.  If the law had been bad,
the apostle would not have referred to it in praise of the Jews.  And if
Christ had not been preached by the law, the Lord Himself would not have
said, "If ye believe Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of
me;" <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) nor would He have borne the
testimony He did after His resurrection, saying, "All things must needs
be fulfilled that were written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets,
and in the Psalms, concerning me." <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p18"></span>4.  But because the Manichæans preach
another Christ, and not Him whom the apostles preached, but a false
Christ of their own false contrivance, in imitation of whose falsehood
they themselves speak lies, though they may perhaps be believed when
they are not ashamed to profess to be the followers of a deceiver, that
has befallen them which the apostle asserts of the unbelieving Jews: 
"When Moses is read, a veil is upon their heart."  Neither will this
veil which keeps them from understanding Moses be taken away from them
till they turn to Christ; not a Christ of their own making, but the
Christ of the Hebrew prophets.  For, as the apostle says, "When thou
shalt turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away." <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md)   We cannot wonder that they do not
believe in the Christ who rose from the dead, and who said, "All things
must needs be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in
the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me;" for this Christ has
Himself told us what Abraham said to a hard-hearted rich man when he was
in torment in hell, and asked Abraham to send some one to his brothers
to teach them, that they might not come too into that place of torment. 
Abraham’s reply was:  "They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear
them."  And when the rich man said that they would not believe unless
some one rose from the dead, he received this most truthful answer:  "If
they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe even
though one rose from the dead." <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md)
  Wherefore, the Manichæans will not hear Moses and the prophets, and so
they do not believe Christ, though He rose from the dead.  Indeed, they
do not even believe that Christ rose from the dead.  For how can they
believe that He rose, when they do not believe that He died?  For,
again, how <span id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_185"></span>can they believe that He died, when they
deny that He had a mortal body?

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p21"></span>5.  But we reject those false teachers
whose Christ is false, or rather, whose Christ never existed.  For we
have a Christ true and truthful, foretold by the prophets, preached by
the apostles, who in innumerable places refer to the testimonies of the
law and the prophets in support of their preaching.  Paul, in one short
sentence, gives the right view of this subject.  "Now," he says, "the
righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by
the law and the prophets." <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md)  
What prophets, if not of Israel, to whom, as he expressly says, pertain
the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the promises?  And what
promises, but about Christ?  Elsewhere, speaking of Christ, he says
concisely:  "All the promises of God are in Him yea." <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md)   Paul tells me that the giving of the
law pertained to the Israelites.  He also tells me that Christ is the
end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.  He also
tells me that all the promises of God are in Christ yea.  And you tell
me that the prophets of Israel foretold nothing of Christ.  Shall I
believe the absurdities of Manichæus relating a vain and long fable in
opposition to Paul? or shall I believe Paul when he forewarns us:  "If
any man preach to you another gospel than that which we have preached,
let him be accursed?"

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p24"></span>6.  Our opponents may perhaps ask us to
point out passages where Christ is predicted by the prophets of Israel. 
One would think they might be satisfied with the authority of the
apostles, who declare that what we read in the writings of the Hebrew
prophets was fulfilled in Christ, or with that of Christ Himself, who
says that these things were written of Him.  Whoever is unable to point
out the passages should lay the blame on his own ignorance; for the
apostles and Christ and the sacred Scriptures are not chargeable with
falsehood.  However, one instance out of many may be adduced.  The
apostle, in the verses following the passage quoted above, says:  "The
word of God cannot fail.  For they are not all Israel which are of
Israel; neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
children:  but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:  that is, they which
are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but
the children of promise are counted for the seed." <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md)   What can our opponent say against
this, in view of the declaration made to Abraham:  "In thy seed shall
all the nations of the earth be blessed?"  At the time when the apostle
gave the following exposition of this promise, "To Abraham and to his
seed were the promises made.  He saith not, To seed, as of many, but as
of one, To thy seed, which is Christ," <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) a doubt on this point might then have
been less inexcusable, for at that time all nations had not yet believed
on Christ, who is preached as of the seed of Abraham.  But now that we
see the fulfillment of what we read in the ancient prophecy,—now that
all nations are actually blessed in the seed of Abraham, to whom it was
said thousands of years ago, "In thy seed shall all nations be
blessed,"—it is mere obstinate folly to try to bring in another Christ,
not of the seed of Abraham, or to hold that there are no predictions of
Christ in the prophetical books of the children of Abraham.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p27"></span>7.  To enumerate all the passages in the
Hebrew prophets referring to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, would
exceed the limits of a volume, not to speak of the brief replies of
which this treatise consists.  The whole contents of these Scriptures
are either directly or indirectly about Christ.  Often the reference is
allegorical or enigmatical, perhaps in a verbal allusion, or in a
historical narrative, requiring diligence in the student, and rewarding
him with the pleasure of discovery.  Other passages, again, are plain;
for, without the help of what is clear, we could not understand what is
obscure.  And even the figurative passages, when brought together, will
be found so harmonious in their testimony to Christ as to put to shame
the obtuseness of the sceptic.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p28"></span>8.  In the creation God finished His
works in six days, and rested on the seventh.  The history of the world
contains six periods marked by the dealings of God with men.  The first
period is from Adam to Noah; the second, from Noah to Abraham; the
third, from Abraham to David; the fourth, from David to the captivity in
Babylon; the fifth, from the captivity to the advent of lowliness of our
Lord Jesus Christ; the sixth is now in progress, and will end in the
coming of the exalted Saviour to judgment.  What answers to the seventh
day is the rest of the saints,—not in this life, but in another, where
the rich man saw Lazarus at rest while he was tormented in hell; where
there is no evening, because there is no decay.  On the sixth day, in
Genesis, man is formed after the image of God; in the sixth period of
the world there is the clear discovery of our transformation in the
renewing of our mind, according to the <span id="page_186">p. 186</span>
<span id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_186"></span>image of Him who created us, as the
apostle says. <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md)   As a wife was
made for Adam from his side while he slept, the Church becomes the
property of her dying Saviour, by the sacrament of the blood which
flowed from His side after His death.  The woman made out of her
husband’s side is called Eve, or Life, and the mother of living beings;
and the Lord says in the Gospel:  "Except a man eat my flesh and drink
my blood, he has no life in him." <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md)   The whole narrative of Genesis, in
the most minute details, is a prophecy of Christ and of the Church with
reference either to the good Christians or to the bad.  There is a
significance in the words of the apostle when he calls Adam "the figure
of Him that was to come;" <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) and
when he says, "A man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave
to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  This is a great mystery;
but I speak concerning Christ and the Church." <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md)   This points most obviously to the
way in which Christ left His Father; for "though He was in the form of
God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, He emptied
Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant." <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md)   And so, too, He left His mother, the
synagogue of the Jews which cleaved to the carnality of the Old
Testament, and was united to the Church His holy bride, that in the
peace of the New Testament they two might be one flesh.  For though with
the Father He was God, by whom we were made, He became in the flesh
partaker of our nature, that we might become the body of which He is the
head.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p34"></span>9.  As Cain’s sacrifice of the fruit of
the ground is rejected, while Abel’s sacrifice of his sheep and the fat
thereof is accepted, so the faith of the New Testament praising God in
the harmless service of grace is preferred to the earthly observances of
the Old Testament.  For though the Jews were right in practising these
things, they were guilty of unbelief in not distinguishing the time of
the New Testament when Christ came, from the time of the Old Testament. 
God said to Cain, "If thou offerest well, yet if thou dividest not well,
thou hast sinned." <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md)   If Cain had
obeyed God when He said, "Be content, for to thee shall be its
reference, and thou shalt rule over it," he would have referred his sin
to himself, by taking the blame of it, and confessing it to God; and so
assisted by supplies of grace, he would have ruled over his sin, instead
of acting as the servant of sin in killing his innocent brother.  So
also the Jews, of whom all these things are a figure, if they had been
content, instead of being turbulent, and had acknowledged the time of
salvation through the pardon of sins by grace, and heard Christ saying,
"They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; I
came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;" <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) and, "Every one that committeth sin is
the servant of sin;" and, "If the Son make you free, ye shall be free
indeed," <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) —they would in
confession have referred their sin to themselves, saying to the
Physician, as it is written in the Psalm, "I said, Lord, be merciful to
me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee." <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md)   And being made free by the hope of
grace, they would have ruled over sin as long as it continued in their
mortal body.  But now, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and
wishing to establish a righteousness of their own, proud of the works of
the law, instead of being humbled on account of their sins, they have
not been content; and in subjection to sin reigning in their mortal
body, so as to make them obey it in the lusts thereof, they have
stumbled on the stone of stumbling, and have been inflamed with hatred
against him whose works they grieved to see accepted by God.  The man
who was born blind, and had been made to see, said to them, "We know
that God heareth not sinners; but if any man serve Him, and do His will,
him He heareth;" <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) as if he had
said, God regardeth not the sacrifice of Cain, but he regards the
sacrifice of Abel.  Abel, the younger brother, is killed by the elder
brother; Christ, the head of the younger people, is killed by the elder
people of the Jews.  Abel dies in the field; Christ dies on Calvary.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p40"></span>10.  God asks Cain where his brother is,
not as if He did not know, but as a judge asks a guilty criminal.  Cain
replies that he knows not, and that he is not his brother’s keeper.  And
what answer can the Jews give at this day, when we ask them with the
voice of God, that is, of the sacred Scriptures, about Christ, except
that they do not know the Christ that we speak of?  Cain’s ignorance was
pretended, and the Jews are deceived in their refusal of Christ. 
Moreover, they would have been in a sense keepers of Christ, if they had
been willing to receive and keep the Christian faith.  For the man who
keeps Christ in his heart does not ask, like Cain, Am I my brother’s
keeper?  Then God says to Cain, "What hast thou done?  The voice of thy
brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground."  So the voice of God in
the Holy Scriptures accuses the Jews.  For the blood <span
id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_187"></span>of
Christ has a loud voice on the earth, when the responsive Amen of those
who believe in Him comes from all nations.  This is the voice of
Christ’s blood, because the clear voice of the faithful redeemed by His
blood is the voice of the blood itself.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p41"></span>11.  Then God says to Cain:  "Thou art
cursed from the earth, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy
brother’s blood at thy hand.  For thou shalt till the earth, and it
shall no longer yield unto thee its strength.  A mourner and an abject
shalt thou be on the earth."  It is not, Cursed is the earth, but,
Cursed art thou from the earth, which hath opened its mouth to receive
thy brother’s blood at thy hand.  So the unbelieving people of the Jews
is cursed from the earth, that is, from the Church, which in the
confession of sins has opened its mouth to receive the blood shed for
the remission of sins by the hand of the people that would not be under
grace, but under the law.  And this murderer is cursed by the Church;
that is, the Church admits and avows the curse pronounced by the
apostle:  "Whoever are of the works of the law are under the curse of
the law." <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md)   Then, after saying,
Cursed art thou from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive
thy brother’s blood at thy hand, what follows is not, For thou shalt
till it, but, Thou shalt till the earth, and it shall not yield to thee
its strength.  The earth he is to till is not necessarily the same as
that which opened its mouth to receive his brother’s blood at his hand. 
From this earth he is cursed, and so he tills an earth which shall no
longer yield to him its strength.  That is, the Church admits and avows
the Jewish people to be cursed, because after killing Christ they
continue to till the ground of an earthly circumcision, an earthly
Sabbath, an earthly passover, while the hidden strength or virtue of
making known Christ, which this tilling contains, is not yielded to the
Jews while they continue in impiety and unbelief, for it is revealed in
the New Testament.  While they will not turn to God, the veil which is
on their minds in reading the Old Testament is not taken away.  This
veil is taken away only by Christ, who does not do away with the reading
of the Old Testament, but with the covering which hides its virtue.  So,
at the crucifixion of Christ, the veil was rent in twain, that by the
passion of Christ hidden mysteries might be revealed to believers who
turn to Him with a mouth opened in confession to drink His blood.  In
this way the Jewish people, like Cain, continue tilling the ground, in
the carnal observance of the law, which does not yield to them its
strength, because they do not perceive in it the grace of Christ.  So
too, the flesh of Christ was the ground from which by crucifying Him the
Jews produced our salvation, for He died for our offences.  But this
ground did not yield to them its strength, for they were not justified
by the virtue of His resurrection, for He arose again for our
justification.  As the apostle says:  "He was crucified in weakness, but
He liveth by the power of God."  <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md)
  This is the power of that ground which is unknown to the ungodly and
unbelieving.  When Christ rose, He did not appear to those who had
crucified Him.  So Cain was not allowed to see the strength of the
ground which he tilled to sow his seed in it; as God said, "Thou shalt
till the ground, and it shall no longer yield unto thee its strength."

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p44"></span>12.  "Groaning and trembling shalt thou
be on the earth."  Here no one can fail to see that in every land where
the Jews are scattered they mourn for the loss of their kingdom, and are
in terrified subjection to the immensely superior number of Christians. 
So Cain answered, and said:  "My case is worse, if Thou drivest me out
this day from the face of the earth, and from Thy face shall I be hid,
and I shall be a mourner and an outcast on the earth; and it shall be
that every one that findeth me shall slay me."  Here he groans indeed in
terror, lest after losing his earthly possession he should suffer the
death of the body.  This he calls a worse case than that of the ground
not yielding to him its strength, or than that of spiritual death.  For
his mind is carnal; for he thinks little of being hid from the face of
God, that is, of being under the anger of God, were it not that he may
be found and slain.  This is the carnal mind that tills the ground, but
does not obtain its strength.  To be carnally minded is death; but he,
in ignorance of this, mourns for the loss of his earthly possession, and
is in terror of bodily death.  But what does God reply?  "Not so," He
says; "but whosoever shall kill Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him
sevenfold."  That is, It is not as thou sayest; not by bodily death
shall the ungodly race of carnal Jews perish.  For whoever destroys them
in this way shall suffer sevenfold vengeance, that is, shall bring upon
himself the sevenfold penalty under which the Jews lie for the
crucifixion of Christ.  So to the end of the seven days of time, the
continued preservation of the Jews will be a proof to believing
Christians of the subjection merited <span id="page_188">p. 188</span>
<span id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_188"></span>by those who, in the pride of their
kingdom, put the Lord to death.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p45"></span>13.  "And the Lord God set a mark upon
Cain, lest any one finding him should slay him."  It is a most notable
fact, that all the nations subjugated by Rome adopted the heathenish
ceremonies of the Roman worship; while the Jewish nation, whether under
Pagan or Christian monarchs, has never lost the sign of their law, by
which they are distinguished from all other nations and peoples.  No
emperor or monarch who finds under his government the people with this
mark kills them, that is, makes them cease to be Jews, and as Jews to be
separate in their observances, and unlike the rest of the world.  Only
when a Jew comes over to Christ, he is no longer Cain, nor goes out from
the presence of God, nor dwells in the land of Nod, which is said to
mean commotion.  Against this evil of commotion the Psalmist prays,
"Suffer not my feet to be moved;" <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) and again, "Let not the hands of the
wicked remove me;" <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) and, "Those
that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved:" <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md)   and, "The Lord is at my right hand,
that I should not be moved;" <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) and
so in innumerable places.  This evil comes upon those who leave the
presence of God, that is, His loving-kindness.  Thus the Psalmist says,
"I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved."  But observe what
follows, "Lord, by Thy favor Thou hast given strength to my honor; Thou
didst hide Thy face, and I was troubled;" <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) which teaches us that not in itself,
but by participation in the light of God, can any soul possess beauty,
or honor, or strength.  The Manichæans should think of this, to keep
them from the blasphemy of identifying themselves with the nature and
substance of God.  But they cannot think, because they are not content. 
The Sabbath of the heart they are strangers to.  If they were content,
as Cain was told to be, they would refer their sin to themselves; that
is, they would lay the blame on themselves, and not on a race of
darkness that no one ever heard of, and so by the grace of God they
would prevail over their sin.  But now the Manichæans, and all who
oppose the truth by their various heresies, leave the presence of God,
like Cain and the scattered Jews, and inhabit the land of commotion,
that is, of carnal disquietude, instead of the enjoyment of God, that is
instead of Eden, which is interpreted Feasting, where Paradise was
planted.  But not to depart too much from the argument of this treatise
I must limit myself to a few, short remarks under this head.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p51"></span>14.  Omitting therefore many passages in
these Books where Christ may be found, but which require longer
explanation and proof, although the most hidden meanings are the
sweetest, convincing testimony may be obtained from the enumeration of
such things as the following:—That Enoch, the seventh from Adam, pleased
God, and was translated, as there is to be a seventh day of rest into
which all will be translated who, during the sixth day of the world’s
history, are created anew by the incarnate Word.  That Noah, with his
family is saved by water and wood, as the family of Christ is saved by
baptism, as representing the suffering of the cross.  That this ark is
made of beams formed in a square, as the Church is constructed of saints
prepared unto every good work:  for a square stands firm on any side. 
That the length is six times the breadth, and ten times the height, like
a human body, to show that Christ appeared in a human body.  That the
breadth reaches to fifty cubits; as the apostle says, "Our heart is
enlarged," <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) that is, with
spiritual love, of which he says again, "The love of God is shed abroad
in our heart by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us." <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md)   For in the fiftieth day after His
resurrection, Christ sent His Holy Spirit to enlarge the hearts of His
disciples.  That it is three hundred cubits long, to make up six times
fifty; as there are six periods in the history of the world during which
Christ has never ceased to be preached,—in five foretold by the
prophets, and in the sixth proclaimed in the gospel.  That it is thirty
cubits high, a tenth part of the length; because Christ is our height,
who in his thirtieth year gave His sanction to the doctrine of the
gospel, by declaring that He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil
it.  Now the ten commandments are to be the heart of the law; and so the
length of the ark is ten times thirty.  Noah himself, too, was the tenth
from Adam.  That the beams of the ark are fastened within and without
with pitch, to signify by compact union the forbearance of love, which
keeps the brotherly connection from being impaired, and the bond of
peace from being broken by the offences which try the Church either from
without or from within.  For pitch is a glutinous substance, of great
energy and force, to represent the ardor of love which, with great power
of endurance, beareth all things in the maintenance of spiritual
communion.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p54"></span>15.  That all kinds of animals are
inclosed in the ark; as the Church contains all nations, which was also
set forth in the vessel shown <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_189"></span>to Peter.  That clean and unclean animals
are in the ark; as good and bad take part in the sacraments of the
Church.  That the clean are in sevens, and the unclean in twos; not
because the bad are fewer than the good, but because the good preserve
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; and the Spirit is spoken
of in Scripture as having a sevenfold operation, as being "the Holy
Spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and might, of knowledge
and piety, and of the fear of God." <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md)   So also the number fifty, which is
connected with the advent of the Holy Spirit, is made up of seven times
seven, and one over; whence it is said, "Endeavoring to keep the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace." <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md)   The bad, again, are in twos, as
being easily divided, from their tendency to schism.  That Noah,
counting his family, was the eighth; because the hope of our
resurrection has appeared in Christ, who rose from the dead on the
eighth day, that is, on the day after the seventh, or Sabbath day.  This
day was the third from His passion; but in the ordinary reckoning of
days, it is both the eighth and the first.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p57"></span>16.  That the whole ark together is
finished in a cubit above; as the Church, the body of Christ gathered
into unity, is raised to perfection.  So Christ says in the Gospel:  "He
that gathereth not with me, scattereth." <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md)   That the entrance is on the side; as
no man enters the Church except by the sacrament of the remission of
sins which flowed from Christ’s opened side.  That the lower spaces of
the ark are divided into two and three chambers:  as the multitude of
all nations in the Church is divided into two, as circumcised and
uncircumcised; or into three, as descended from the three sons of Noah. 
And these parts of the ark are called lower, because in this earthly
state there is a difference of races, and above we are completed in
one.  *Above* there is no diversity; for Christ is all and in all,
finishing us, as it were, in one cubit above with heavenly unity.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p59"></span>17.  That the flood came seven days
after Noah entered the ark; as we are baptized in the hope of the future
rest, which was denoted by the seventh day.  That all flesh on the face
of the earth, outside the ark, was destroyed by the flood; as, beyond
the communion of the Church, though the water of baptism is the same, it
is efficacious only for destruction, and not for salvation.  That it
rained for forty days and forty nights; as the sacrament of heavenly
baptism washes away all the guilt of the sins against the ten
commandments throughout all the four quarters of the world (four times
ten is forty), whether that guilt has been contracted in the day of
prosperity or in the night of adversity.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p60"></span>18.  That Noah was five hundred years
old when God told him to make the ark, and six hundred when he entered
the ark; which shows that the ark was made during one hundred years,
which seem to correspond to the years of an age of the world.  So the
sixth age is occupied with the construction of the Church by the
preaching of the gospel.  The man who avails himself of the offer of
salvation is made like a square beam, fitted for every good work, and
forms part of the sacred fabric.  Again, it was the second month of the
six hundredth year when Noah entered the ark, and in two months there
are sixty days; so that here, as in every multiple of six, we have the
number denoting the sixth age.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p61"></span>19.  That mention is made of the twenty
seventh day of the month; as we have already seen the significance of
the square in the beams.  Here especially it is significant; for as
twenty-seven is the cube of three, there is a trinity in the means by
which we are, as it were, squared, or fitted for every good work.  By
the memory we remember God; by the understanding we know Him; by the
will we love Him.  That in the seventh month the ark rested; reminding
us again of the seventh day of rest.  And here again, to denote the
perfection of those at rest, the twenty-seventh day of the month is
mentioned for the second time.  So what is promised in hope is realized
in experience.  There is here a combination of seven and eight; for the
water rose fifteen cubits above the mountains, pointing to a profound
mystery in baptism,—the sacrament of our regeneration.  For the seventh
day of rest is connected with the eighth of resurrection.  For when the
saints receive again their bodies after the rest of the intermediate
state, the rest will not cease; but rather the whole man, body and soul
united, renewed in the immortal health, will attain to the realization
of his hope in the enjoyment of eternal life.  Thus the sacrament of
baptism, like the waters of Noah, rises above all the wisdom of the
proud.  Seven and eight are also combined in the number of one hundred
and fifty, made up of seventy and eighty, which was the number of days
during which the water prevailed, pointing out the deep import of
baptism in consecrating the new man to hold the faith of rest and
resurrection.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p62"></span>20.  That the raven sent out after forty
days did not return, being either prevented <span id="page_190">p.
190</span> <span id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_190"></span>by the water or
attracted by some floating carcase; as men defiled by impure desire, and
therefore eager for things outside in the world, are either baptized, or
are led astray into the company of those to whom, as they are outside
the ark, that is, outside the Church, baptism is destructive.  That the
dove when sent forth found no rest, and returned; as in the New
Testament rest is not promised to the saints in this world.  The dove
was sent forth after forty days, a period denoting the length of human
life.  When again sent forth after seven days, denoting the sevenfold
operation of the Spirit, the dove brought back a fruitful olive branch;
as some even who are baptized outside of the Church, if not destitute of
the fatness of charity, may come after all, as it were in the evening,
and be brought into the one communion by the mouth of the dove in the
kiss of peace.  That, when again sent forth after seven days, the dove
did not return; as, at the end of the world, the rest of the saints
shall no longer be in the sacrament of hope, as now, while in the
communion of the Church, they drink what flowed from the side of Christ,
but in the perfection of eternal safety, when the kingdom shall be
delivered up to God and the Father, and when, in that unclouded
contemplation of unchangeable truth, we shall no longer need natural
symbols.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p63"></span>21.  There are many other points which
we cannot take notice of even in this cursory manner.  Why in the six
hundred and first year of Noah’s life—that is, after six hundred years
were completed—the covering of the ark is removed, and the hidden
mystery, as it were, disclosed.  Why the earth is said to have dried on
the twenty-seventh day of the second month; as if the number fifty-seven
denoted the completion of the rite of baptism.  For the twenty-seventh
day of the second month is the fifty-seventh day of the year; and the
number fifty-seven is seven times eight, which are the numbers of the
spirit and the body, with one over, to denote the bond of unity.  Why
they leave the ark together, though they entered separately.  For it is
said:  "Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives
with him, into the ark;" the men and the women being spoken of
separately; which denotes the time when the flesh lusteth against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.  But they go forth, Noah and
his wife, and his sons and their wives,—the men and women together.  For
in the end of the world, and in the resurrection of the just, the body
will be united to the spirit in perfect harmony, undisturbed by the
wants and the passions of mortality.  Why, after leaving the ark, only
clean animals are offered in sacrifice to God, though both clean and
unclean were in the ark.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p64"></span>22.  Then, again, it is significant that
when God speaks to Noah, and begins anew, as it were, in order, by
repetition in various forms, to draw attention to the figure of the
Church, the sons of Noah are blessed, and told to replenish the earth,
and all animals are given to them for food; as was said to Peter of the
vessel, "Kill and eat."  That they are told to pour out the blood when
they eat; that the former life may not be kept shut up in the
conscience, but may be, as it were, poured out in confession.  That God
makes the bow, which appears in the clouds only when the sun shines, the
sign of His covenant with men, and with every living thing, that He will
not destroy them with a flood; as those do not perish by the flood, in
separation from the Church, who in the clouds of God—that is, in the
prophets and in all the sacred Scriptures—discern the glory of Christ,
instead of seeking their own glory.  The worshippers of the sun,
however, need not pride themselves on this; for they must understand
that the sun, as also a lion, a lamb, and a stone, are used as types of
Christ because they have some resemblance, not because they are of the
same substance.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p65"></span>23.  Again, the sufferings of Christ
from His own nation are evidently denoted by Noah being drunk with the
wine of the vineyard he planted, and his being uncovered in his tent. 
For the mortality of Christ’s flesh was uncovered, to the Jews a
stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness; but to them that are
called, both Jews and Greeks, both Shem and Japhet, the power of God and
the wisdom of God.  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men,
and the weakness of God is stronger than men. <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p67"></span>Moreover, the two sons, the eldest and
the youngest, carrying the garment backwards, are a figure of the two
peoples, and the sacrament of the past and completed passions of the
Lord.  They do not see the nakedness of their father, because they do
not consent to Christ’s death; and yet they honor it with a covering, as
knowing whence they were born.  The middle son is the Jewish people, for
they neither held the first place with the apostles, nor believed
subsequently with the Gentiles.  They saw the nakedness of their father,
because they consented to Christ’s death; and they told it to their
brethren outside, for what was hidden in the prophets was disclosed by
the Jews.  And thus they are the <span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_191"></span>servants of their brethren.  For what
else is this nation now but a desk for the Christians, bearing the law
and the prophets, and testifying to the doctrine of the Church, so that
we honor in the sacrament what they disclose in the letter?

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p68"></span>24.  Again, every one must be impressed,
and be either enlightened or confirmed in the faith, by the blessing of
the two sons who honored the nakedness of their father, though they
turned away their faces, as displeased with the evil done by the vine. 
"Blessed," he says, "be the Lord God of Shem."  For although God is the
God of all nations, even the Gentiles acknowledge Him to be in a
peculiar sense the God of Israel.  And how is this to be explained but
by the blessing of Japhet?  The occupation of all the world by the
Church among the Gentiles was exactly foretold in the words:  "Let God
enlarge Japhet, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem."  That is for
the Manichæan to attend to.  You see what the state of the world
actually is.  The very thing that you are astonished and grieved at in
us is this, that God is enlarging Japhet.  Is He not dwelling in the
tents of Shem?—that is, in the churches built by the apostles, the sons
of the prophets.  Hear what Paul says to the believing Gentiles:  "Ye
were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of
Israel, and strangers from the covenants; having no hope of the promise,
and without God in the world."  In these words there is a description of
the state of Japhet before he dwelt in the tents of Shem.  But observe
what follows:  "Now then;" he says, "ye are no more strangers and
foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of
God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone." <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md)   Here we have Japhet enlarged, and
dwelling in the tents of Shem.  These testimonies are taken from the
epistles of the apostles, which you yourselves acknowledge, and read,
and profess to follow.  You occupy an unhappy middle position in a
building of which Christ is not the chief corner-stone.  For you do not
belong to the wall of those who, like the apostles, being of the
circumcision, believed in Christ; nor to the wall of those who, being of
the uncircumcision, like all the Gentiles, are joined in the unity of
faith, as in the fellowship of the corner-stone.  However, all who
accept and read any books of our canon in which Christ is spoken of as
having been born and having suffered in the flesh, and who do not unite
with us in a common veiling with the sacrament of the mortality,
uncovered by the passion, but without the knowledge of piety and charity
make known that from which we all are born,—although they differ among
themselves, whether as Jews and heretics, or as heretics of one kind or
other,—are still all useful to the Church, as being all alike servants,
either in bearing witness to or in proving some truth.  For of heretics
it is said:  "There must be heresies, that those who are approved among
you may be manifested." <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md)   Go on,
then, with your objections to the Old Testament Scriptures!  Go on, ye
servants of Ham!  You have despised the flesh from which you were born
when uncovered.  For you could not have called yourselves Christians
unless Christ had come into the world, as foretold by the prophets, and
had drunk of His own vine that cup which could not pass from Him, and
had slept in His passion, as in the drunkenness of the folly which is
wiser than men; and so, in the hidden counsel of God, the disclosure had
been made of that infirmity of mortal flesh which is stronger than men. 
For unless the Word of God had taken on Himself this infirmity, the name
of Christian, in which you also glory, would not exist in the earth.  Go
on, then, as I have said.  Declare in mockery what we may honor with
reverence.  Let the Church use you as her servants to make manifest
those members who are approved.  So particular are the predictions of
the prophets regarding the state and the sufferings of the Church, that
we can find a place even for you in what is said of the destructive
error by which the reprobate are to perish, while the approved are to be
manifested.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p71"></span>25.  You say that Christ was not
foretold by the prophets of Israel, when, in fact, their Scriptures teem
with such predictions, if you would only examine them carefully, instead
of treating them with levity.  Who in Abraham leaves his country and
kindred that he may become rich and prosperous among strangers, but He
who, leaving the land and country of the Jews, of whom He was born in
the flesh, is now extending His power, as we see, among the Gentiles? 
Who in Isaac carried the wood for His own sacrifice, but He who carried
His own cross?  Who is the ram for sacrifice, caught by the horns in a.
bush, but He who was fastened to the cross as an offering for us?

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p72"></span>26.  Who in the angel striving with
Jacob, on the one hand is constrained to give him a blessing, as the
weaker to the stronger, the conquered to the conqueror, and on the other
<span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_192"></span>hand puts his thigh-bone out of joint,
but He who, when He suffered the people of Israel to prevail against
Him, blessed those among them who believed, while the multitude, like
Jacob’s thigh-bone, halted in their carnality?  Who is the stone placed
under Jacob’s head, but Christ the head of man?  And in its anointing
the very name of Christ is expressed, for, as all know, Christ means
anointed.  Christ refers to this in the Gospel, and declares it to be a
type of Himself, when He said of Nathanael that he was an Israelite
indeed, in whom was no guile, and when Nathanael, resting his head, as
it were, on this Stone, or on Christ, confessed Him as the Son of God
and the King of Israel anointing the Stone by his confession, in which
he acknowledged Jesus to be Christ.  On this occasion the Lord made
appropriate mention of what Jacob saw in his dream "Verily I say unto
you, Ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of man." <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md)
  This Jacob saw, who in the blessing was called Israel, when he had the
stone for a pillow, and had the vision of the ladder reaching from earth
to heaven, on which the angels of God were ascending and
descending. <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md)   The angels denote
the evangelists, or preachers of Christ.  They ascend when they rise
above the created universe to describe the supreme majesty of the divine
nature of Christ as being in the beginning God with God, by whom all
things were made.  They descend to tell of His being made of a woman,
made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law. 
Christ is the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, or from the carnal
to the spiritual:  for by His assistance the carnal ascend to
spirituality; and the spiritual may be said to descend to nourish the
carnal with milk when they cannot speak to them as to spiritual, but as
to carnal. <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md)   There is thus both
an ascent and a descent upon the Son of man.  For the Son of man is
above as our head, being Himself the Saviour; and He is below in His
body, the Church.  He is the ladder, for He says, "I am the way."  We
ascend to Him to see Him in heavenly places; we descend to Him for the
nourishment of His weak members.  And the ascent and descent are by Him
as well as to Him.  Following His example, those who preach Him not only
rise to behold Him exalted, but let themselves down to give a plain
announcement of the truth.  So the apostle ascends, "Whether we be
beside ourselves, it is to God;" and descends, "Whether we be sober, it
is for your sake."  And by whom did he ascend and descend?  "For the
love of Christ constraineth us:  for we thus judge, that if one died for
all, then all died; and that He died for all, that they which live
should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him that died for them,
and rose again."  <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p77"></span>27.  The man who does not find pleasure
in these views of sacred Scripture is turned away to fables, because he
cannot bear sound doctrine.  The fables have an attraction for childish
minds in people of all ages; but we who are of the body of Christ should
say with the Psalmist; "O Lord, the wicked have spoken to me pleasing
things, but they are not after Thy law." <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md)   In every page of these Scriptures,
while I pursue my search as a son of Adam in the sweat of my brow,
Christ either openly or covertly meets and refreshes me.  Where the
discovery is laborious my ardor is increased, and the spoil obtained is
eagerly devoured, and is hidden in my heart for my nourishment.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p79"></span>28.  Christ appears to me in Joseph, who
was persecuted and sold by his brethren, and after his troubles obtained
honor in Egypt.  We have seen the troubles of Christ in the world, of
which Egypt was a figure, in the sufferings of the martyrs.  And now we
see the honor of Christ in the same world which He subdues to Himself,
in exchange for the food which He bestows.  Christ appears to me in the
rod of Moses, which became a serpent when cast on the earth as a figure
of His death, which came from the serpent.  Again, when caught by the
tail it became a rod, as a figure of His return after the accomplishment
of His work in His resurrection to what He was before, destroying death
by His new life, so as to leave no trace of the serpent.  We, too, who
are His body, glide along in the same mortality through the folds of
time; but when at last the tail of this course of things is laid hold of
by the hand of judgment that it shall go no further, we shall be
renewed, and rising from the destruction of death, the last enemy, we
shall be the sceptre of government in the right hand of God.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p80"></span>29.  Of the departure of Israel from
Egypt, let us hear what the apostle himself says:  "I would not,
brethren, that ye should be ignorant that all our fathers were under the
cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses
in the cloud and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat,
and did all drink of the same spiritual drink.  For they drank of the
spiritual rock which followed them, and that rock was Christ."  <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>
<span id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_193"></span>The explanation of one thing is a
key to the rest.  For if the rock is Christ from its stability, is not
the manna Christ, the living bread which came down from heaven, which
gives spiritual life to those who truly feed on it?  The Israelites died
because they received the figure only in its carnal sense.  The apostle,
by calling it spiritual food, shows its reference to Christ, as the
spiritual drink is explained by the words, "That rock was Christ," which
explain the whole.  Then is not the cloud and the pillar Christ, who by
His uprightness and strength supports our feebleness; who shines by
night and not by day, that they who see not may see, and that they who
see may be made blind?  In the clouds and the Red Sea there is the
baptism consecrated by the blood of Christ.  The enemies following
behind perish, as past sins are put away.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p82"></span>30.  The Israelites are led through the
wilderness, as those who are baptized are in the wilderness while on the
way to the promised land, hoping and patiently waiting for that which
they see not.  In the wilderness are severe trials, lest they should in
heart return to Egypt.  Still Christ does not leave them; the pillar
does not go away.  The bitter waters are sweetened by wood, as hostile
people become friendly by learning to honor the cross of Christ.  The
twelve fountains watering the seventy palm trees are a figure of
apostolic grace watering the nations.  As seven is multiplied by ten, so
the decalogue is fulfilled in the sevenfold operation of the Spirit. 
The enemy attempting to stop them in their way is overcome by Moses
stretching out his hands in the figure of the cross.  The deadly bites
of serpents are healed by the brazen serpent, which was lifted up that
they might look at it.  The Lord Himself gives the explanation of this: 
"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of
man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but
have everlasting life." <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md)   So in
many other things we may find a protest against the obstinacy of
unbelieving hearts.  In the passover a lamb is killed, representing
Christ, of whom it is said in the Gospel, "Behold the Lamb of God, who
taketh away the sin of the world!" <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md)   In the passover the bones of the
lamb were not to be broken; and on the cross the bones of the Lord were
not broken.  The evangelist, in reference to this, quotes the words, "A
bone of Him shall not be broken." <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md)   The posts were marked with blood to
keep away destruction, as people are marked on their foreheads with the
sign of the Lord’s passion for their salvation.  The law was given on
the fiftieth day after the passover; so the Holy Spirit came on the
fiftieth day after the passion of the Lord.  The law is said to have
been written with the finger of God; and the Lord says of the Holy
Spirit, "With the finger of God I cast out devils." <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md)   Such are the Scriptures in which
Faustus, after shutting his eyes, declares that he can see no prediction
of Christ.  But we need not wonder that he should have eyes to read and
yet no heart to understand, since, instead of knocking in devout faith
at the door of the heavenly secret, he dares to act in profane
hostility.  So let it be, for so it ought to be.  Let the gate of
salvation be shut to the proud.  The meek, to whom God teaches His ways,
will find all these things in the Scriptures, and those things which he
does not see he will believe from what he sees.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p87"></span>31.  He will see Jesus leading the
people into the land of promise; for this name was given to the leader
of Israel, not at first, or by chance, but on account of the work to
which he was called.  He will see the cluster from the land of promise
hanging from a wooden pole.  He will see in Jericho, as in this
perishing world, an harlot, one of those of whom the Lord says that they
go before the proud into the kingdom of heaven, putting out of her
window a scarlet line symbolical of blood, as confession is made with
the mouth for the remission of sins.  He will see the walls of Jericho,
like the frail defences of the world, fall when compassed seven times by
the ark of the covenant; as now in the course of the seven days of time
the covenant of God compasses the whole globe, that in the end, death,
the last enemy, may be destroyed, and the Church, like one single house,
be saved from the destruction of the ungodly, purified from the
defilement of fornication by the window of confession in the blood of
remission.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p88"></span>32.  He will see the times of the judges
precede those of the kings, as the judgment will precede the kingdom. 
And under both the judges and the kings he will see Christ and the
Church repeatedly prefigured in many and various ways.  Who was in
Samson, when he killed the lion that met him as he went to get a wife
among strangers, but He who, when going to call His Church from among
the Gentiles, said, "Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world?"
 <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md)   What means the hive in the
mouth of the slain lion, but that, as we see, the very laws of the
earthly king<span id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_194"></span>dom which once raged against Christ have
now lost their fierceness, and have become a protection for the
preaching of gospel sweetness?  What is that woman boldly piercing the
temples of the enemy with a wooden nail, but the faith of the Church
casting down the kingdom of the devil by the cross of Christ?  What is
the fleece wet while the ground was dry, and again the fleece dry while
the ground was wet, but the Hebrew nation at first possessing alone in
its typical institution Christ the mystery of God, while the whole world
was in ignorance?  And now the whole world has this mystery revealed,
while the Jews are destitute of it.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p90"></span>33.  To mention only a few things in the
times of the kings, at the very outset does not the change in the
priesthood when Eli was rejected and Samuel chosen, and in the kingdom
when Saul was rejected and David chosen, clearly predict the new
priesthood and kingdom to come in our Lord Jesus Christ, when the old,
which was a shadow of the new, was rejected?  Did not David, when he ate
the shew-bread, which it was not lawful for any but the priests to eat,
prefigure the union of the kingdom and priesthood in one person, Jesus
Christ?  In the separation of the ten tribes from the temple while two
were left, is there not a figure of what the apostle asserts of the
whole nation:  "A remnant is saved by the election of grace."? <span
id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p92"></span>34.  In the time of famine, Elijah is
fed by ravens bringing bread in the morning and flesh in the evening;
but the Manichæans cannot in this perceive Christ, who, as it were,
hungers for our salvation, and to whom sinners come in confession,
having now the first-fruits of the Spirit, while in the end, that is to
say in the evening of the age, they will have the resurrection of their
bodies also.  Elijah is sent to be fed by a widow woman of another
nation, who was going to gather two sticks before she died, denoting the
two wooden beams of the cross.  Her meal and oil are blessed, as the
fruit and cheerfulness of charity do not diminish by expenditure, for
God loveth a cheerful giver. <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p94"></span>35.  The children that mocked Elisha by
calling out Baldhead, are devoured by wild beasts, as those who in
childish folly scoff at Christ crucified on Calvary are destroyed by
devils.  Elisha sends his servants to lay his staff on the dead body,
but it does not revive; he comes himself, and lays himself exactly upon
the dead body, and it revives:  as the Word of God sent the law by His
servant, without any profit to mankind dead in sins; and yet it was not
sent without purpose by Him who knew the necessity of its being first
sent.  Then He Himself came, conformed Himself to us by participation in
our death, and we were revived.  When they were cutting down wood with
axes, the iron, flying off the wood, sank to the bottom of the river,
and came up again when the wood was thrown in by Elisha.  So, when
Christ’s bodily presence was cutting down the unfruitful trees among the
unbelieving Jews, according to the saying of John, "Behold, the axe is
laid to the roots of the tree," <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md)
by the death they inflicted, Christ was separated from His body, and
descended to the depths of the infernal world; and then, when His body
was laid in the tomb, like the wood on the water, His spirit returned,
like the iron to the handle, and He rose.  The reader will observe how
many things of this kind are omitted for the sake of brevity.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p96"></span>36.  As regards the departure to
Babylon, where the Spirit of God by the prophet Jeremiah enjoins them to
go, telling them to pray for the people in whose land they dwell as
strangers, because in their peace they would find peace, and to build
houses, and plant vineyards and gardens,—the figurative meaning is
plain, when we consider that the true Israelites, in whom is no guile,
passed over in the ministry of the apostles with the ordinances of the
gospel into the kingdom of the Gentiles.  So the apostle, like an echo
of Jeremiah, says to us, "I will first of all that prayer,
supplications, intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men,
and for those in authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceable life
in all godliness and charity; for this is good and acceptable in the
sight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be saved, and to come
to the knowledge of the truth." <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md)
  Accordingly the basilicas of Christian congregations have been built
by believers as abodes of peace, and vineyards of the faithful have been
renewed, and gardens planted, where chief among the plants is the
mustard tree, in whose wide-spreading branches the pride of the
Gentiles, like the birds of heaven, in its soaring ambition, takes
shelter.  Again, in the return from captivity after seventy years,
according to Jeremiah’s prophecy, and in the restoration of the temple,
every believer in Christ must see a figure of our return as the Church
of God from the exile of this world to the heavenly Jerusalem, after the
seven days of time have fulfilled their course.  Joshua the high priest,
after the captivity, who rebuilt the temple, was a <span
id="page_195">p. 195</span> <span id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_195"></span>figure
of Jesus Christ, the true High Priest of our restoration.  The prophet
Zechariah saw this Joshua in a filthy garment; and after the devil who
stood by to accuse him was defeated, the filthy garment was taken from
him, and a dress of honor and glory given him.  So the body of Jesus
Christ, which is the Church, when the adversary is conquered in the
judgment at the end of the world, will pass from the pains of exile to
the glory of everlasting safety.  This is the song of the Psalmist at
the dedication of his house:  "Thou hast turned for me my mourning into
gladness; Thou hast removed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness,
that my glory may sing praise unto Thee, and not be silent."  <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p99"></span>37.  It is impossible, in a digression
like this, to refer, however briefly, to all the figurative predictions
of Christ which are to be found in the law and the prophets.  Will it be
said that these things happened in the regular course of things, and
that it is a mere ingenious fancy to make them typical of Christ?  Such
an objection might come from Jews and Pagans; but those who wish to be
considered Christians must yield to the authority of the apostle when he
says, "All these things happened to them for an example;" and again,
"These things are our examples." <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md)
  For if two men, Ishmael and Isaac, are types of the two covenants, can
it be supposed that there is no significance in the vast number of
particulars which have no historical or natural value?  Suppose we were
to see some Hebrew characters written on the wall of a noble building,
should we be so foolish as to conclude that, because we cannot
understand the characters, they are not intended to be read, and are
mere painting, without any meaning?  So, whoever with a candid mind
reads all these things that are contained in the Old Testament
Scriptures, must feel constrained to acknowledge that they have a
meaning.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p101"></span>38.  As an example of those particulars
which have no meaning at all if not a symbolical one:  Granting that it
was necessary that woman should be made as an help meet for man, what
natural reason can be assigned for her being taken from his side while
he slept?  Granting that an ark was required in order to escape from the
flood, why should it have precisely these dimensions, and why should
they be recorded for the devout study of future generations?  Granting
that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve the various
races, why should there be seven clean and two unclean?  Granting that
the ark must have a door, why should it be in the side, and why should
this fact be committed to writing?  Abraham is commanded to sacrifice
his son:  we may allow that this proof of his obedience was required in
order to make it conspicuous in all ages; we may allow, too, that it was
a proper thing for the son to carry the wood instead of the aged father,
and that in the end the fatal stroke was forbidden, lest the father
should be left childless.  But what had the shedding of the ram’s blood
to do with Abraham’s trial? or if it was necessary to complete the
sacrifice, was the ram any the better of being caught by the horns in a
bush?  The human mind, that is to say, a rational mind, is led by the
consideration of the way in which these apparently superfluous things
are blended with what is necessary, first to acknowledge their
significance, and then to try to discover it.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p102"></span>39.  The Jews themselves, who scoff at
the crucified Saviour in whom we believe, and who consequently will not
allow that Christ is predicted in the sayings and actions recorded in
the Old Testament, are compelled to come to us for an explanation of
those things which, if not explained, must appear trifling and
ridiculous.  This led Philo, a Jew of great learning, whom the Greeks
speak of as rivalling Plato in eloquence, to attempt to explain some
things without any reference to Christ, in whom he did not believe.  His
attempt only shows the inferiority of all ingenious speculations, when
made without keeping Christ in view, to whom all the predictions really
point.  So true is that saying of the apostle:  "When they shall turn to
the Lord, the veil shall be taken away." <span
id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md)   For instance, Noah’s ark is,
according to Philo, a type of the human body, member by member:  with
this view, he shows that the numerical proportions agree perfectly.  For
there is no reason why a type of Christ should not be a type of the
human body, too, since the Saviour of mankind appeared in a human body,
though what is typical of a human body is not necessarily typical of
Christ.  Philo’s explanation fails, however, as regards the door in the
side of the ark.  He actually, for the sake of saying something, makes
this door represent the lower apertures of the body.  He has the
hardihood to put this in words, and on paper.  Indeed, he knew not the
door and could not understand the symbol.  Had he turned to Christ the
veil would have been taken away, and he would have found the sacraments
of the Church flowing from the side of Christ’s human body.  For, <span
id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_196"></span>according to the announcement, "They two
shall be one flesh," some things in the ark which is a type of Christ,
refer to Christ, and some to the Church.  This contrast between the
explanations which keep Christ in view, and all other ingenious
perversions, is the same in every particular of all the figures in
Scripture.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p104"></span>40.  The Pagans, too, cannot deny our
right to give a figurative meaning to both words and things, especially
as we can point to the fulfillment of the types and figures.  For the
Pagans themselves try to find in their own fables figures of natural and
religious truth.  Sometimes they give clear explanations, while at other
times they disguise their meaning, and what is sacred in the temples
becomes a jest in the theatres.  They unite a disgraceful licentiousness
to a degrading superstition.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p105"></span>41.  Besides this wonderful agreement
between the types and the things typified, the adversary may be
convinced by plain prophetic intimations, such as this:  "In thy seed
shall all nations be blessed."  This was said to Abraham, <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) and again to Isaac, <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) and again to Jacob. <span
id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md)   Hence the significance of the words
"I am the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob." <span
id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md)   God fulfills His promise to their
seed in blessing all nations.  With a like significance, Abraham
himself, when he made his servant swear, told him to put his hand under
his thigh; <span id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) for he knew that
thence would come the flesh of Christ, in whom we have now, not the
promise of blessing to all nations, but the promise fulfilled.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p111"></span>42.  I should like to know, or rather,
it would be well not to know, with what blindness of mind Faustus reads
the passage where Jacob calls his sons, and says, "Assemble, that I may
tell you the things that are to happen in the last day.  Assemble and
hear, ye sons of Jacob; give ear to Israel, your father."  Surely these
are the words of a prophet.  What, then, does he say of his son Judah,
of whose tribe Christ came of the seed of David according to the flesh,
as the apostle teaches?  "Judah," he says, "thy brethren shall praise
thee:  thy hand shall be upon the backs of thine enemies; the sons of
thy father shall bow down to thee.  Judah is a lion’s whelp; my son and
offspring:  bowing down, thou hast gone up:  thou sleepest as a lion,
and as a young lion, who will rouse him up?  A prince shall not depart
from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till those things come which
have been laid up for him.  He also is the desire of nations:  binding
his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt with sackcloth, he shall wash
his garment in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:  his eyes
are bright with wine, and his teeth whiter than milk." <span
id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md)   There is no falsehood or obscurity
in these words when we read them in the clear light of Christ.  We see
His brethren the apostles and all His joint-heirs praising Him, seeking,
not their own glory, but His.  We see His hands on the backs of His
enemies, who are bent and bowed to the earth by the growth of the
Christian communities in spite of their opposition.  We see Him
worshipped by the sons of Jacob, the remnant saved according to the
election of grace.  Christ, who was born as an infant, is the lion’s
whelp, as it is added, My son and offspring, to show why this whelp, in
whose praise it is said, "The lion’s whelp is stronger than the
herd," <span id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) is even in infancy
stronger than its elders.  We see Christ ascending the cross, and bowing
down when He gave up His spirit.  We see Him sleeping as a lion, because
in death itself He was not the conquered, but the conqueror, and as a
lion’s whelp; for the reason of His birth and of His death was the
same.  And He is raised from the dead by Him whom no man hath seen or
can see; for the words, "Who will raise Him up?" point to an unknown
power.  A prince did not depart from Judah, nor a leader from his loins,
till in due time those things came which had been laid up in the
promise.  For we learn from the authentic history of the Jews
themselves, that Herod, under whom Christ was born, was their first
foreign king.  So the sceptre did not depart from the seed of Judah till
the things laid up for him came.  Then, as the promise is not only to
the believing Jews, it is added:  "He is the desire of the nations." 
Christ bound His foal—that is, His people—to the vine, when He preached
in sackcloth, crying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." 
The Gentiles made subject to Him are represented by the ass’s colt, on
which He also sat, leading it into Jerusalem, that is, the vision of
peace teaching the meek His ways.  We see Him washing His garments in
wine; for He is one with the glorious Church, which He presents to
Himself, not having spot or wrinkle; to whom also it is said by Isaiah: 
"Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow." <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md)   How is this done but by the
remission of sins?  And the wine is none other than that of which it is
said that it is "shed for many, for the remission of sins."  Christ is
the cluster that hung on the <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_197"></span>pole.  So it is added, "and His clothes
in the blood of the grape."  Again, what is said of His eyes being
bright with wine, is understood by those members of His body who are
enabled, in holy aberration of mind from the current of earthly things,
to gaze on the eternal light of wisdom.  So Paul says in a passage
quoted before:  "If we be beside ourselves, it is to God."  Those are
the eyes bright with wine.  But he adds:  "If we be sober, it is for
your sakes."  The babes needing to be fed with milk are not forgotten,
as is denoted by the words, "His teeth are whiter than milk."

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p115"></span>43.  What can our deluded adversaries
say to such plain examples, which leave no room for perverse denial, or
even for sceptical uncertainty?  I call on the Manichæans to begin to
inquire into these subjects, and to admit the force of these evidences,
on which I have no time to dwell; nor do I wish to make a selection, in
case the ignorant reader should think there are no others, while the
Christian student might blame me for the omission of many points more
striking than those which occur to me at the moment.  You will find many
passages which require no such explanation as has been given here of
Jacob’s prophecy.  For instance, every reader can understand the words,
"He was led as a lamb to the slaughter," and the whole of that plain
prophecy, "With His stripes we are healed"—"He bore our sins." <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md)   We have a poetical gospel in the
words:  "They pierced my hands and feet.  They have told all my bones. 
They look and stare upon me.  They divided my garments among them, and
cast lots on my vesture." <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md)   The
blind even may now see the fulfillment of the words:  "All the ends of
the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord, and all kingdoms of the
nations shall worship before Him."  The words in the Gospel, "My soul is
sorrowful, even unto death," "My soul is troubled," are a repetition of
the words in the Psalm, "I slept in trouble." <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md)   And who made Him sleep?  Whose
voices cried, Crucify him, crucify him?  The Psalm tells us:  "The sons
of men, their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp
sword." <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md)   But they could not
prevent His resurrection, or His ascension above the heavens, or His
filling the earth with the glory of His name; for the Psalm says:  "Be
Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let Thy glory be above all
the earth."  Every one must apply these words to Christ:  "The Lord said
unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee.  Ask of me, and
I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost
parts of the earth for Thy possession." <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md)   And what Jeremiah says of wisdom
plainly applies to Christ:  "Jacob delivered it to his son, and Israel
to his chosen one.  Afterwards He appeared on earth, and conversed with
men." <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p122"></span>44.  The same Saviour is spoken of in
Daniel, where the Son of man appears before the Ancient of days, and
receives a kingdom without end, that all nations may serve Him. <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md)   In the passage quoted from Daniel by
the Lord Himself, "When ye shall see the abomination of desolation,
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, let him
that readeth understand," <span id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) the
number of weeks points not only to Christ, but to the very time of His
advent.  With the Jews, who look to Christ for salvation as we do, but
deny that He has come and suffered, we can argue from actual events. 
Besides the conversion of the heathen, now so universal, as prophesied
of Christ in their own Scriptures, there are the events in the history
of the Jews themselves.  Their holy place is thrown down, the sacrifice
has ceased, and the priest, and the ancient anointing; which was all
clearly foretold by Daniel when he prophesied of the anointing of the
Most Holy. <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md)   Now, that all these
things have taken place, we ask the Jews for the anointed Most Holy, and
they have no answer to give.  But it is from the Old Testament that the
Jews derive all the knowledge they have of Christ and His advent.  Why
do they ask John whether he is Christ?  Why do they say to the Lord,
"How long dost thou make us to doubt?  If thou art the Christ, tell us
plainly."  Why do Peter and Andrew and Philip say to Nathanael, "We have
found Messias, which is interpreted Christ," but because this name was
known to them from the prophecies of their Scriptures?  In no other
nation were the kings and priests anointed, and called Anointed or
Christs.  Nor could this symbolical anointing be discontinued till the
coming of Him who was thus prefigured.  For among all their anointed
ones the Jews looked for one who was to save them.  But in the
mysterious justice of God they were blinded; and thinking only of the
power of the Messiah, they did not understand His weakness, in which He
died for us.  In the book of Wisdom it is prophesied of the Jews:  "Let
us condemn him to an ignominious death; for he will be proved in his
words.  If he is truly the Son of God, He will aid him; and deliver him
from the hand of his <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_198"></span>enemies.  Thus they thought, and erred;
for their wickedness blinded them." <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md)   These words apply also to those who,
in spite of all these evidences, in spite of such a series of
prophecies, and of their fulfillment, still deny that Christ is foretold
in the Scriptures.  As often as they repeat this denial, we can produce
fresh proofs, with the help of Him who has made such provision against
human perversity, that proofs already given need not be repeated.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p127"></span>45.  Faustus has an evasive objection,
which he no doubt thinks a most ingenious way of eluding the force of
the clearest evidence of prophecy, but of which one is unwilling to take
any notice, because answering it may give it an appearance of importance
which it does not really possess.  What could be more irrational than to
say that it is weak faith which will not believe in Christ without
evidence?  Do our adversaries, then, believe in testimony about Christ? 
Faustus wishes us to believe the voice from heaven as distinguished from
human testimony.  But did they hear this voice?  Has not the knowledge
of it come to us through human testimony?  The apostle describes the
transmission of this knowledge, when he says:  "How shall they call on
Him on whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on Him of
whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
and how shall they preach except they be sent?  As it is written, "How
beautiful are the feet of them who publish peace, who bring good
tidings!" <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md)   Clearly, in the
preaching of the apostles there was a reference to prophetic testimony. 
The apostles quoted the predictions of the prophets, to prove the truth
and importance of their doctrines.  For although their preaching was
accompanied with the power of working miracles, the miracles would have
been ascribed to magic, as some even now venture to insinuate, unless
the apostles had shown that the authority of the prophets was in their
favor.  The testimony of prophets who lived so long before could not be
ascribed to magical arts.  Perhaps the reason why Faustus will not have
us believe the Hebrew prophets as witnesses of the true Christ, is
because he believes Persian heresies about a false Christ.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p129"></span>46.  According to the teaching of the
Catholic Church, the Christian mind must first be nourished in simple
faith, in order that it may become capable of understanding things
heavenly and eternal.  Thus it is said by the prophet:  "Unless ye
believe, ye shall not understand." <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md)   Simple faith is that by which,
before we attain to the height of the knowledge of the love of Christ,
that we may be filled with all the fullness of God, we believe that not
without reason was the dispensation of Christ’s humiliation, in which He
was born and suffered as man, foretold so long before by the prophets
through a prophetic race, a prophetic people, a prophetic kingdom.  This
faith teaches us, that in the foolishness which is wiser than men, and
in the weakness which is stronger than men, is contained the hidden
means of our justification and glorification.  There are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge, which are opened to no one who
despises the nourishment transmitted through the breast of his mother
that is, the milk of apostolic and prophetic instruction; or who,
thinking himself too old for infantile nourishment, devours heretical
poison instead of the food of wisdom, for which he rashly thought
himself prepared.  To require simple faith is quite consistent with
requiring faith in the prophets.  The very use of simple faith is to
believe the prophets at the outset, while the understanding of the
person who speaks in the prophets is attained after the mind has been
purified and strengthened.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p131"></span>47.  But, it is said, if the prophets
foretold Christ, they did not live in a way becoming their office.  How
can you tell whether they did or not?  You are bad judges of what it is
to live well or ill, whose justice consists in giving relief to an
inanimate melon by eating it, instead of giving food to the starving
beggar.  It is enough for the babes in the Catholic Church, who do not
yet know the perfect justice of the human soul, and the difference
between the justice aimed at and that actually attained, to think of
those men according to the wholesome doctrine of the apostles, that the
just lives by faith.  "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him
for righteousness.  For the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify
the Gentiles by faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying,
In thy seed shall all nations be blessed." <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md)   These are the words of the apostle. 
If you would, at his clear well-known voice, wake up from your
unprofitable dreams, you would follow in the footsteps of our father
Abraham, and would be blessed, along with all nations, in his seed. 
For, as the apostle says, "He received the sign of circumcision, a seal
of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised,
that he might be the father of all that believe in uncircumcision; that
he might be the father of circumcision not only to those who are of the
circumcision, but also to those who follow the <span id="page_199">p.
199</span> <span id="iv.ix.xiv-Page_199"></span>footsteps of the faith
of our father Abraham in uncircumcision." <span
id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md)   Since the righteousness of Abraham’s
faith is thus set forth as an example to us, that we too, being
justified by faith, may have peace with God, we ought to understand his
manner of life, without finding fault with it; lest, by a premature
separation from mother-Church, we prove abortions, instead of being
brought forth in due time, when the conception has arrived at
completeness.

<span id="iv.ix.xiv-p134"></span>48.  This is a brief reply to Faustus
in behalf of the character of the patriarchs and prophets.  It is the
reply of the babes of our faith, among whom I would reckon myself,
inasmuch as I would not find fault with the life of the ancient saints,
even if I did not understand its mystical character.  Their life is
proclaimed to us with approval by the apostles in their Gospel, as they
themselves in their prophecy foretold the future apostles, that the two
Testaments, like the seraphim, might cry to one another, "Holy, holy,
holy is the Lord God of hosts." <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md)
  When Faustus, instead of the vague general accusation which he makes
here, condemns particular actions in the lives of the patriarchs and the
prophets, the Lord their God, and ours also, will assist me to reply
suitably and appropriately to the separate charges.  For the present,
the reader must choose whether to believe the commendation of the
Apostle Paul or the accusations of Faustus the Manichæan. <span
