<span id="v.iv.viii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—</span>18.  Nemesianus of
Tubunæ <span id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) said:  "That the
baptism which is given by heretics and schismatics is not true is
everywhere declared in the holy Scriptures, inasmuch as their very
prelates are false Christs and false prophets, as the Lord declares by
the mouth of Solomon, ‘Whoso trusteth in lies, the same feedeth the
winds; he also followeth flying birds.  For he deserteth the ways of his
own vineyard, and hath strayed from the paths of his own field.  For he
walketh through pathless and dry places, and a land destined to thirst;
and he gathereth fruitless weeds in his hands.’ <span
id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md)   And again, ‘Abstain from strange
water, and drink not of a strange fountain, that thou mayest live long,
and that years may be added to thy life.’ <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md)   And in the gospel our Lord Jesus
Christ spake with His own voice, saying, ‘Except a man be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.’ <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md)   This is the Spirit which from the
beginning ‘moved upon the face of the waters.’ <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md)   For neither can the Spirit act
without the water, nor the water without the Spirit.  Ill, therefore,
for themselves do some interpret, saying that by imposition of hands
they receive the Holy Ghost, and are received into the Church, when it
is manifest that they ought to be born again by both sacraments in the
Catholic Church.  For then indeed will they be able to become the sons
of God, as the apostle says, ‘Endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace.  There is one body, and one Spirit, even as
ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one
baptism, one God.’ <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md)   All this
the Catholic Church asserts.  And again he says in the gospel, ‘That
which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is God, and is born of God.’ <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md)   Therefore all things whatsoever
all heretics and schismatics do are carnal, as the apostle says, ‘Now
the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these:  fornication,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, <span
id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xii-Page_485"></span>hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
seditions, heresies, and such like:  of the which I tell you before, as
I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall
not inherit the kingdom of God.’  <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md)   The apostle condemns, equally
with all the wicked, those also who cause divisions, that is,
schismatics and heretics.  Unless therefore they receive that saving
baptism which is one, and found only in the Catholic Church, they cannot
be saved, but will be condemned with the carnal in the judgment of the
Lord."

<span id="v.iv.viii.xii-p10"></span>19.  Nemesianus of Tubunæ has
advanced many passages of Scripture to prove his point; but he has in
fact said much on behalf of the view of the Catholic Church, which we
have undertaken to set forth and maintain.  Unless, indeed, we must
suppose that he does not "trust in what is false" who trusts in the hope
of things temporal, as do all covetous men and robbers, and those "who
renounce the world in words but not in deeds," of whom Cyprian yet bears
witness that such men not only baptize, but even are baptized within the
Church. <span id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md)   For they themselves
also "follow flying birds," <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md)
since they do not attain to what they desire.  But not only the heretic,
but everyone who leads an evil life "deserteth the ways of his own
vineyard, and hath strayed from the paths of his own field.  And he
walketh through pathless and dry places, and a land destined to thirst;
and he gathereth fruitless weeds in his hands;" because all justice is
fruitful, and all iniquity is barren.  Those, again, who "drink strange
water out of a strange fountain," are found not only among heretics, but
among all who do not live according to the teaching of God, and do live
according to the teaching of the devil.  For if he were speaking of
baptism, he would not say, "Do not drink of a strange fountain," but, do
not wash thyself in a strange fountain.  Again, I do not see at all what
aid he gets towards proving his point from the words of our Lord,
"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God."  <span id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md)   For
it is one thing to say that every one who shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven is first born again of water and the Spirit, because except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven, which is the Lord’s saying, and is true; another
thing to say that every one who is born of water and the Spirit shall
enter into the kingdom of heaven, which is assuredly false.  For Simon
Magus also was born of water and of the Spirit,  <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) and yet he did not enter into the
kingdom of heaven; and this may possibly be the case with heretics as
well.  Or if only those are born of the Spirit who are changed with a
true conversion, all "who renounce the world in word and not in deed"
are assuredly not born of the Spirit, but of water only, and yet they
are within the Church, according to the testimony of Cyprian.  For we
must perforce grant one of two things,—either those who renounce the
world deceitfully are born of the Spirit, though it is to their
destruction, not to salvation, and therefore heretics may be so born; or
if what is written, that "the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee
deceit," <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) extends to proving
as much as this, that those who renounce the world deceitfully are not
born of the Spirit, then a man may be baptized with water, and not born
of the Spirit, and Nemesianus says in vain that neither the Spirit can
work without the water, nor the water without the Spirit.  Indeed it has
been already often shown how it is possible that men should have one
baptism in common who have not one Church, as it is possible that in the
body of the Church herself those who are sanctified by their
righteousness, and those who are polluted through their covetousness,
may not have the same one Spirit, and yet have the same one baptism. 
For it is said "one body," that is, the Church, just as it is said "one
Spirit" and "one baptism."  The other arguments which he has adduced
rather favor our position.  For he has brought forward a proof from the
gospel, in the words, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and
that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is God, and
born of God;" <span id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) and he has
advanced the argument that therefore all things that are done by any
heretic or schismatic are carnal, as the apostle says, "The works of the
flesh are manifest, which are these:  fornication, uncleanness;" and so
he goes through the list which the apostle there enumerates, amongst
which he has reckoned heresies, since "they who do such things shall not
inherit the kingdom of God." <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md)
  Then he goes on to add, that "therefore the apostle condemns with all
wicked men those also who cause division, that is, schismatics and
heretics."  And in this he does well, that when he enumerates the works
of the flesh, among which are also heresies, he found and declared that
the apostle condemns them all alike.  Let him therefore question the
holy Cyprian himself, and learn from him how many even within the Church
live according to the evil works of the flesh, which the apostle
condemns in common with the heresies, <span id="page_486">p. 486</span>
<span id="v.iv.viii.xii-Page_486"></span>and yet these both baptize and
are baptized.  Why then are heretics alone said to be incapable of
possessing baptism, which is possessed by the very partners in their
condemnation?

text, that whatsoever is born of the Spirit is spirit, since the Holy
Ghost, being God, and born of, or proceeding from God, in virtue of His
supreme power makes those to be spirits whom He regenerates.  If the
meaning had been (as Bishop Fell takes it), that "he who is born of the
Spirit is born of God," the neuter *"de Deo natum est"* would have been
required.  To refer *"Spiritus Deus est,"* with the Benedictines, to
[John iv. 24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md)<span

and destroys the sense of the passage.  The above explanation is taken

xxxvi., quoted by Routh, *Rel. Sac*. iii. 193.
