<span id="v.iv.viii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—</span>16.  Novatus of
Thamugadis <span id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607) said:  "Though we
know that all Scripture gives its testimony respecting saving baptism,
yet we ought to express our belief that heretics and schismatics, coming
to the Church with the semblance of having been baptized, ought to be
baptized in the unfailing fountain; and that therefore, according to the
testimony of the Scriptures, and according to the decree of those most
holy men, our colleagues, <span id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608) all
schismatics and heretics who are converted to the Church ought to be
baptized; and that, moreover, all that seemed to have received
ordination should be admitted as simple laymen."

<span id="v.iv.viii.xi-p4"></span>17.  Novatus of Thamugadis has stated
what he has done, but he has brought forward no proofs by which to show
that he ought to have acted as he did.  For he has made mention of the
testimony of the Scriptures, and the decree of his colleagues, but he
has not adduced out of them anything which we could consider.
