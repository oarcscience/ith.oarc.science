<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—</span>69.  Eucratius of
Theni <span id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724.md) said:  "Our God and
Lord Jesus Christ, teaching the apostles with His own mouth, fully laid
down our faith, and the grace of baptism, and the rule of the law of the
Church, saying, ‘Go ye, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.’ <span
id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725.md)   Therefore the false and
unrighteous baptism of heretics is to be repudiated by us, and
contradicted with all solemnity of witness, seeing that from their mouth
issues not life, but poison, not heavenly grace, but blaspheming of the
Trinity.  And so it is plain that heretics coming to the Church ought to
be baptized with perfect and Catholic baptism, that, being purified from
the blasphemy of their presumption, they may be reformed by the grace of
the Holy Spirit."  <span id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxvi-p5"></span>70.  Clearly, if the baptism is not
consecrated in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost, it should be considered to be of the heretics, and repudiated as
unrighteous by us with all solemnity of witness; but if we discern this
name in it, we do better to distinguish the words of the gospel from
heretical error, and approve what is sound in them, correcting what is
faulty.
