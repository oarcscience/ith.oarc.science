<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iii.xxviii-p2"></A>30.&#160; "But these things," they say, "bring no pollution in the cause of peace; and it is well to bend to mercy the rigor of extreme severity, that broken branches may be grafted in anew."&#160; Accordingly, in this way the whole question is settled, by defeat in them, by the impossibility of defeat for us; for if the name of peace be assumed for even the faintest shadow of defense to justify the bearing with wicked men in schism, then beyond all doubt the violation of true   peace itself involves detestable guilt, with nothing to be said in its defence throughout the unity of the world.</p>
