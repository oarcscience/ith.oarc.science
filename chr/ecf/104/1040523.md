<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—</span>83.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Which <span id="page_552">p. 552</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.xxxvi-Page_552"></span>Holy Spirit certainly cannot come on
you, who have not been washed even with the baptism of repentance; but
the water of the *traditor*, which most truly needs to be repented of,
does but work pollution."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p2"></span>84.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  As a matter of
fact, not only do you not prove us to be *traditors*, but neither did
your fathers prove that our fathers were guilty of that sin; though,
even if that had been proved, the consequence would have been that they
would not be our fathers, according to your earlier assertion, seeing
that we had not followed their deeds:  yet neither should we on their
account be severed from the companionship of unity, and from the seed of
Abraham, in which all nations of the earth are blessed. <span
id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085)   However, if the water of Christ
be one thing, and the water of the *traditor* another, because Christ
was not a *traditor*, why should not the water of Christ be one thing,
and the water of a robber another, since certainly Christ was not a
robber?  Do you therefore baptize again after baptism by your robber,
and I will baptize again after the *traditor*, who is neither mine nor
yours; or, if one must believe the documents which are produced, who is
both mine and yours; or, if we are to believe the communion of the whole
world rather than the party of Donatus, who is not mine, but yours. 
But, by a better and a sounder judgment, because it is according to the
words of the apostle, every one of us shall bear his own burden; <span
id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086) nor is either that robber yours, if
you are not yourselves robbers; nor does any *traditor* belong to any
one either of us or you, who is not himself a *traditor*.  And yet we
are Catholics, who, following the spirit of that judgment, do not desert
the unity of the Church; but you are heretics, who, on account of
charges, whether true or false, which you have brought against certain
men, are unwilling to maintain Christian charity with the seed of
Abraham.
