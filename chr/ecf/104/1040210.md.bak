<span id="iv.x.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—That Creatures are Made of
Nothing.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxviii-p2"></span>Because therefore God made all things
which He did not beget of Himself, not of those things that already
existed, but of those things that did not exist at all, that is, of
nothing," the Apostle Paul says:  "Who calls the things that are not as
if they are." <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md)   But still
more plainly it is written in the book of Maccabees:  "I pray thee, son,
look at the <span id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span
id="iv.x.xxviii-Page_357"></span>heaven and the earth and all the things
that are in them; see and know that it was not these of which the Lord
God made us." <span id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md)   And from this
that is written in the Psalm:  "He spake, and they were made." <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md)   It is manifest, that not of
Himself He begat these things, but that He made them by word and
command.  But what is not of Himself is assuredly of nothing.  For there
was not anything of which he should make them, concerning which the
apostle says most openly:  "For from Him, and through Him, and in Him
are all things." <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md)
