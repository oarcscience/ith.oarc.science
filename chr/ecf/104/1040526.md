<span id="v.v.iv.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—</span>92.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxxix-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But there is no fellowship of darkness with light, nor any fellowship
of bitterness with the sweet of honey; there is no fellowship of life
with death, of innocence with guilt, of water with blood; the lees have
no fellowship with oil though they are related to it as being its dregs,
but everything that is reprobate will flow away.  It is the very sink of
iniquity; according to the saying of John, ‘They went out from us, but
they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt
have continued with us.’ <span id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md)  
There is no gold among their pollution:  all that is precious has been
purged away.  For it is written, ‘As gold is tried in the furnace, so
also are the just tried by the harassing of tribulation.’ <span
id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md)   Cruelty is not a part of
gentleness, nor religion a part of sacrilege; nor can the party of
Macarius <span id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104.md) in any way be part
of us, because he pollutes the likeness of our rite.  For the enemy’s
line, which fills up an enemy’s name, is no part of the force to which
it is opposed; but if it is truly to be called a part, it will find a
suitable motto in the judgment of Solomon, ‘Let their part be cut off
from the earth.’" <span id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105.md)

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxix-p6"></span>93.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxix-p6.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  What is it but
sheer madness to utter these taunts without proving anything?  You look
at the tares throughout the world, and pay no heed to the wheat,
although both have been bidden to grow together throughout the whole of
it.  You look at the seed sown by the wicked one, which shall be
separated in the time of harvest, <span
id="fr_2106"></span>[2107](#fn_2106.md) and you pay no heed to the seed of
Abraham, in which all nations of the earth shall be blessed. <span
id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107.md)   Just as though you were already a
purged mass, and virgin honey, and refined oil, and pure gold, or rather
the very similitude of a whited wall.  For, to say nothing of your other
faults, do the drunken form a portion of the sober, or are the covetous
reckoned among the portion of the wise?  If men of gentle temper
appropriate the term of light, where shall the madness of the
Circumcelliones be esteemed to be, excepting in the darkness?  Why then
is baptism, given by men like these, held valid among you, and the same
baptism of Christ not held valid, by whatsoever men it may be
administered throughout the world?  You see, in fact, that you are
separated from the communion of the whole world in so far as this, that
you are not indeed all drunk, nor all of you covetous, nor all men of
violence, but that you are all heretics, and, in virtue of this, are all
impious and all sacrilegious.

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxix-p9"></span>94.  But as to your saying that the
whole world that rejoices in Christian communion is the party of
Macarius, who with any remnant of sanity in his brain could make such a
statement?  But because we say that you are of the party of Donatus, you
therefore seek for a man of whose party you may say we are; and, being
in a great strait, you mention the name of some obscure person, who, if
he is known in Africa, is certainly unknown in any other quarter of the
globe.  And therefore hearken to the answer made to you by all the seed
of Abraham from every corner of the earth:  Of that Macarius, to whose
party you assert us to belong, we know absolutely nothing.  Can you
reply in turn that you know nothing of Donatus?  But even if we were to
say that you are the party of Optatus, which of you can say that he is
unacquainted with Optatus, unless in the sense that he does not know him
personally, as perhaps he does not know Donatus either?  But you
acknowledge that you rejoice in the name of Donatus, do you also take
any pleasure in the name of Optatus?  What then can the name of Donatus
profit you, when all of you alike are polluted by Optatus?  What
advantage can you derive from the sobriety of Donatus, when you are
defiled by the drunkenness of the Circumcelliones?  What, according to
your views, are you profited by the innocence of Donatus, when you are
stained by the rapacity of Optatus?  For this is your mistake, that you
think that the unrighteousness of a man has more power in infecting his
neighbor than the righteousness of a man has in purifying those around
him.  Therefore, if two share <span id="page_556">p. 556</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.xxxix-Page_556"></span>in common the sacraments of God, the
one a just man, the other an unrighteous one, but so that neither the
former should imitate the unrighteousness of the latter, nor the latter
the righteousness of the former, you say that the result is not that
both are made just, but that both are made unrighteous; so that also
that holy thing, which both receive in common, becomes unclean and loses
its original holiness.  When does unrighteousness find for herself such
advocates as these, through whose madness she is esteemed victorious? 
How comes it then that, in the midst of such mistaken perversity, you
congratulate yourselves upon the name of Donatus, when it shows not that
Petilianus deserves to be what Donatus is, but that Donatus is compelled
to be what Optatus is?  But let the house of Israel say, "God is my
portion for ever;" <span id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108.md) let the
seed of Abraham say in all nations "The Lord is the portion of mine
inheritance." <span id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109.md)   For they know
how to speak through the gospel of the glory of the blessed God.  For
you, too, through the sacrament which is in you, like Caiaphas the
persecutor of the Lord, prophesy without being aware of it. <span
id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110.md)   For what in Greek is expressed by
the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxix-p12.2"></span>Μαχάριος</span> is in our language simply
"Blessed;" and in this way certainly we are of the party of Macarius,
the Blessed One.  For what is more blessed than Christ, of whose party
we are, after whom all the ends of the earth are called, and to whom
they all are turned, and in whose sight all the countries of the nations
worship?  Therefore the party of this Macarius, that is to say, of this
Blessed One, feels no apprehension at your last curse, distorted from
the words of Solomon, lest it should perish from the earth.  For what is
said by him of the impious you endeavor to apply to the inheritance of
Christ, and you strive to prove that this has been achieved with
inexpressible impiety; for when he was speaking of the impious, he says,
"Let their portion perish from off the earth." <span
id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111.md)   But when you say, with reference
to the words of Scripture, "I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine
inheritance," <span id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112.md) and "all the
ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord," <span
id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113.md) that the promise contained in them
has already perished from the earth, you are seeking to turn against the
inheritance of Christ what was foretold about the lot of the impious;
but so long as the inheritance of Christ endures and increases, you are
perishing in saying such things.  For you are not in every case
prophesying through the sacrament of God, since in this case you are
merely uttering evil wishes through your own madness.  But the prophecy
of the true prophets is more powerful than the evil speaking of the
false prophets.
