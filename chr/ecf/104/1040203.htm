<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xxi-p2"></A>Magnificently and divinely, therefore, our God said to his servant:&#160; "I am that I am," <A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A> <a name="iv.x.xxi-Page_355"></A>and "Thou shalt say to the children of Israel, He who is sent me to you."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1089"></A><A HREF="#fn_1089"><FONT SIZE="1">1090</FONT></A>
&#160; For He truly is because He is unchangeable.&#160; For every change makes what was not, to be:&#160; therefore He truly is, who is unchangeable; but all other things that were made by Him have received being from Him each in its own measure.&#160; To Him who is highest, therefore nothing can be contrary, save what is not; and consequently as from Him everything that is good has its being, so from Him is everything that by nature exists; since everything that exists by nature is good.&#160; Thus every nature is good, and everything good is from God; therefore every nature is from God.</p>
