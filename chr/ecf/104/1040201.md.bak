No Evil.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xix-p2"></span>No nature, therefore, as far as it is
nature, is evil; but to each nature there is no evil except to be
diminished in respect of good.  But if by being diminished it should be
consumed so that there is no good, no nature would be left; not only
such as the Manichæans introduce, where so great good things are found
that their exceeding blindness is wonderful, but such as any one can
introduce.
