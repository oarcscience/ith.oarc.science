<span id="v.v.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—36</span>.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xvi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"The Lord Christ also warns us, saying, ‘Beware of false prophets, which
come unto you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves; and ye shall not know them by their fruits.’" <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016)

<span id="v.v.iv.xvi-p3"></span>37.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xvi-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  If I were to
inquire of you by what fruits you know us to be ravening wolves, you are
sure to answer by charging us with the sins of other men, and these such
as were never proved against those who are said to have been guilty of
them.  But if you should ask of me by what fruits we know you rather to
be ravening wolves, I bring against you the charge of schism, which you
will deny, but which I will straightway go on to prove; for, as a matter
of fact, you do not communicate with all the nations of the earth, nor
with those Churches which were founded by the labor of the apostles. 
Hereupon you will say, "I do not communicate with *traditors* and
murderers."  The seed of Abraham answers you, "These are those charges
which you made, which are either not true, or have no reference to me." 
But these I set aside for the present; do you meanwhile show me the
Church.  Now that voice will sound in my ears which the Lord showed was
to be avoided in the false prophets who made a show of their several
parties, and strove to estrange men from the Catholic Church, "Lo, here
is Christ, or there."  But do you think that the true sheep of Christ
are so utterly destitute of sense, who are told, "Believe it not," <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017) that they will hearken to the wolf
when he says, "Lo, here is Christ," and will not hearken to the Shepherd
when He says, "Throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem?"
