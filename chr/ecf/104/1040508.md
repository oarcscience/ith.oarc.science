<span id="v.v.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—</span>47.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Accordingly, as we have said, the Lord Christ cried, ‘Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me?  It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 
And he said, Who art Thou, Lord?  And the Lord said, I am Christ of
Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.  And he, trembling and astonished,
said, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?  And the Lord said unto him,
Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must
do.’  And so presently it goes on, ‘But Saul arose from the earth; and
when his eyes were opened, he saw no man.’  See here how blindness,
coming in punishment of madness, obscures the light in the eyes of the
persecutor, not to be again expelled except by baptism!  Let us see,
therefore, what he did in the city.  ‘Ananias,’ it is said, ‘entered
into the house to Saul, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother
Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou
camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be
filled with the Holy Ghost.  And immediately there fell from his eyes as
it had been scales; and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was
baptized.’ <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md)   Seeing therefore
that Paul, being freed by baptism from the offense of persecution,
received again his eyesight freed from guilt, why will not you, a
persecutor and *traditor*, blinded by false baptism be baptized by those
whom you persecute?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xxi-p3"></span>48.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxi-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  You do not prove
that I, whom you wish to baptize afresh, am either a persecutor or a
*traditor*.  And if you prove this charge against any one, yet the
persecutor and *traditor* is not to be baptized afresh, if he had been
baptized already with the baptism of Christ.  For the reason why it was
necessary that Paul should be baptized was that he had never been washed
in any baptism of the kind.  Therefore what you have chosen to insert
about Paul has no point of resemblance with the case which you are
arguing with us.  But if you had not inserted this, you would have found
no place for your childish declamation, "See how blindness comes in
punishment of madness, not to be again expelled except by baptism!"  For
with how much more force might one exclaim against you, See how
blindness comes in punishment of madness, which, finding its similitude
in Simon, not in Paul, is not expelled from you even when you have
received baptism?  For if persecutors ought to be baptized by those whom
they persecute, then let Primianus be baptized by the followers of <span

id="v.v.iv.xxi-Page_542"></span>Maximianus, whom he persecuted with the
utmost eagerness.
