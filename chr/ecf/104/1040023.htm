<p class="c10"><a name="iv.iv.iv-p2"></A>3.&#160; Where, then, shall I begin?&#160; With authority, or with reasoning?&#160; In the order of nature, when we learn anything, authority precedes reasoning.&#160; For a reason may seem weak, when, after it is given, it requires authority to confirm it.&#160; But because the minds of men are obscured by familiarity with darkness, which covers them in the night of sins and evil habits, and cannot perceive in a way suitable to the clearness and purity of reason, there is most wholesome provision for bringing the dazzled eye into the light of truth under the congenial shade of authority.&#160; But since we have to do with people who are perverse in all their thoughts and words and actions, and who insist on nothing more than on beginning with argument, I will, as a concession to them, take what I think a wrong method in discussion.&#160; For I like to imitate, as far as I can, the gentleness of my Lord Jesus Christ, who took on Himself the evil of death itself, wishing to free us from it.</p>
