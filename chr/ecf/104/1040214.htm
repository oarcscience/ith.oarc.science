<p class="c38"><a name="iv.x.xxxii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.x.xxxii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 30.&#8212;That Good Things, Even the Least, and Those that are Earthly, are by God.</span></p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.x.xxxii-p2"></A>But that God made even the least things, that is, earthly and mortal things, must undoubtedly be understood from that passage of the apostle, where, speaking of the members of our flesh:&#160; "For if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it, and if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it;" also this he then says:&#160; "God has placed the members each one of them in the body as he willed;" and "God has tempered the body, giving to that to which it was wanting greater honor, that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care one for another."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1110"></A><A HREF="#fn_1110"><FONT SIZE="1">1111</FONT></A>
&#160; But what the apostle thus praises in the measure and form and order of the members of the flesh, you find in the flesh of all animals, alike the greatest and the least; for all flesh is among earthly goods, and consequently is esteemed among the least.</p>
