id="iv.x.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—God Makes Good Use of the Evil
Deeds of Sinners.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxxix-p2"></span>Accordingly, if all natures should guard
their own proper measure and form and order, there would be no evil: 
but if any one should wish to misuse these good things, not even thus
does he vanquish the will of God, who knows how to order righteously
even the unrighteous; so that if they themselves through the iniquity of
their will should misuse His good things, He through the righteousness
of His power may use their evil deeds, rightly ordaining to punishment
those who have perversely ordained themselves to sins.
