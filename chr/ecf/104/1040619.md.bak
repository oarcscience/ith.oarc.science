<span id="v.v.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—</span>26.  Lastly, if these two
or three words, What if, and Possibly, are so absolutely intolerable,
that on their account we should have aroused from their long sleep the
Academics, and Carneades, and Pilus, and Furius, and Diagoras, and black
snow, and the falling of the sky, and everything else that is equally
senseless and absurd, let them be removed from our argument.  For, as a
matter of fact, it is by no means impossible to express what we desire
to say without them.  There is quite sufficient for our purpose in what
is found a little later, and has been introduced by himself from my
letter:  "By what means then is he to be cleansed who receives baptism
when the conscience of the <span id="page_607">p. 607</span> <span
id="v.v.v.xxii-Page_607"></span>giver is polluted, and that without the
knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament?" <span
id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md)   Do you acknowledge that here
there is no What if, no Possibly?  Well then, let an answer be given. 
Give close heed, lest he be found to answer this in what follows. 
"But," says he, "I bind you in your cavilling to the faith of believing,
that you may not wander further from it.  Why do you turn away your life
from errors by arguments of folly?  Why do you disturb the system of
belief in respect of matters without reason?  By this one word I bind
and convince you."  It was Petilianus that said this, not I.  These
words are from the letter of Petilianus; but from that letter, to which
I just now added the two words which he accuses me of having suppressed,
showing that, notwithstanding their addition, the pertinency of my
question, to which he makes no answer, remains with greater brevity and
simplicity.  It is beyond dispute that these two words are, In holiness,
and Wittingly:  so that it should not be, "The conscience of him who
gives," but "The conscience of him who gives *in holiness;*" and that it
should not be, "He who has received his faith from one that is
faithless," but "He who has *wittingly* received his faith from one that
is faithless."  And yet I had not really suppressed these words; but I
had not found them in the copy which was placed in my hands.  It is
possible enough that it was incorrect; nor indeed is it wholly beyond
the possibility of belief that even by this suggestion Academic grudge
should be roused against me, and that it should be asserted that, in
declaring the copy to be incorrect, I had said much the same sort of
thing as if I had declared that snow was black.  For why should I repay
in kind his rash suggestion, and say that, though he pretends that I
suppressed the words, he really added them afterwards himself, since the
copy, which is not angry, can confirm that mark of incorrectness,
without any abusive rashness on my part?
