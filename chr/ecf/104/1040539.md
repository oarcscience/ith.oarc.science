<span id="v.v.iv.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52.—</span>119.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"If you suppose that you can offer sacrifice, God Himself thus speaks of
you as most abandoned sinners:  ‘The wicked man,’ He says, ‘that
sacrificeth a calf is as if he cut off a dog’s neck; and he that
offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine’s blood<span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lii-p1.3"></span>.’ <span
id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135)  </span> Recognize herein your
sacrifice, who have already poured out human blood.  And again He says,
‘Their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that
eat thereof shall be polluted.’" <span
id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136)

<span id="v.v.iv.lii-p4"></span>120.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lii-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  We say that in
the case of every man the sacrifice that is offered partakes of the
character of him who approaches to offer it, or approaches to partake of
it; and that those eat of the sacrifices of such men, who in approaching
to them partake of the character of those who offer them.  Therefore, if
a bad man offer sacrifice to God, and a good man receive it at his
hands, the sacrifice is to each man of such character as he himself has
shown himself to be, since we find it also written that "unto the pure
all things are pure." <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137)   In
accordance with this true and catholic judgment, you too are free from
pollution by the sacrifice of Optatus, if you disapproved of his deeds. 
For certainly his bread was the bread of mourners, seeing that all
Africa was mourning under his iniquities.  But the evil involved in the
schism of all your party makes this bread of mourners common to you
all.  For, according to the judgment of your Council, Felicianus of
Musti was a shedder of man’s blood.  For you said, in condemning
them, <span id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138) "Their feet are swift
to shed blood." <span id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139)   See
therefore what kind of sacrifice he offers whom you hold to be a priest,
when you have yourselves convicted him of sacrilege.  And if you think
that this is in no way to your prejudice, I would ask you how the
emptiness of your calumnies can be to the prejudice of the whole world?
