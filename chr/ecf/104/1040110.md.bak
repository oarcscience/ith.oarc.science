<span id="iv.viii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.viii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—The Festival of the Birth-Day of
Manichæus.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.ix-p2"></span>9.  In adding the words, "by the
providence of God the Father," what else did Manichæus design but that,
having got the name of Jesus Christ, whose apostle he calls himself, and
of God the Father, by whose providence he says he was sent by the Son,
we should believe himself, as the Holy Spirit, to be the third person? 
His words are:  "Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the
providence of God the Father."  The Holy Spirit is not named, though He
ought specially to have been named by one who quotes to us in favor of
his apostleship the promise of the Paraclete, that he may prevail upon
ignorant people by the authority of the gospel.  In reply to this, you
of course say that in the name of the Apostle Manichæus we have the name
of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, because He condescended to come into
Manichæus.  Why then, I ask again, should you cry out against the
doctrine of the Catholic Church, that He in whom divine Wisdom came was
born of a virgin, when you do not scruple to affirm the birth by
ordinary generation of him in whom you say the Holy Spirit came?  I
cannot but suspect that this Manichæus, who uses the name of Christ to
gain access to the minds of the ignorant, wished to be worshipped
instead of Christ Himself.  I will state briefly the reason of this
conjecture.  At the time when I was a student of your doctrines, to my
frequent inquiries why it was that the Paschal feast of the Lord was
<span id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="iv.viii.ix-Page_133"></span>celebrated generally with no interest,
though sometimes there were a few languid worshippers, but no watchings,
no prescription of any unusual fast,—in a word, no special
ceremony,—while great honor is paid to your Bema, that is, the day on
which Manichæus was killed, when you have a platform with fine steps,
covered with precious cloth, placed conspicuously so as to face the
votaries,—the reply was, that the day to observe was the day of the
passion of him who really suffered, and that Christ, who was not born,
but appeared to human eyes in an unreal semblance of flesh, only feigned
suffering, without really bearing it.  Is it not deplorable, that men
who wish to be called Christians are afraid of a virgin’s womb as likely
to defile the truth, and yet are not afraid of falsehood?  But to go
back to the point, who that pays attention can help suspecting that the
intention of Manichæus in denying Christ’s being born of a woman, and
having a human body, was that His passion, the time of which is now a
great festival all over the world, might not be observed by the
believers in himself, so as to lessen the devotion of the solemn
commemoration which he wished in honor of the day of his own death?  For
to us it was a great attraction in the feast of the Bema that it was
held during Pascha, since we used all the more earnestly to desire that
festal day \[the Bema\], that the other which was formerly most sweet
had been withdrawn.
