<span id="v.iv.ix.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 54.—</span>103.  But now I think
that it is fully time for me to bring to their due termination these
books also on the subject of baptism, in which our Lord God has shown to
us, through the words of the peaceful Bishop Cyprian and his brethren
who agreed with him, how great is the love which should be felt for
catholic unity; so that even where they were otherwise minded until God
should reveal even this to them,  <span
id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917) they should rather bear with those
who thought differently from themselves, than sever themselves from them
by a wicked schism; whereby the mouths of the Donatists are wholly
closed, even if we say nothing of the followers of Maximian.  For if the
wicked pollute the good in unity, then even Cyprian himself already
found no <span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix.liv-Page_514"></span>Church to which he could be joined. 
But if the wicked do not infect the good in unity, then the sacrilegious
Donatist has no ground to set before himself for separation.  But if
baptism is both possessed and transferred by the multitude of others who
work the works of the flesh, of which it is said, that "they which do
such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God," <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918) then it is possessed and
transferred also by heretics, who are numbered among those works;
because they could have transferred it had they remained, and did not
lose it by their secession.  But men of this kind confer it on their
fellows as fruitlessly and uselessly as the others who resemble them,
inasmuch as they shall not inherit the kingdom of God.  And as, when
those others are brought into the right path, it is not that baptism
begins to be present, having been absent before, but that it begins to
profit them, having been already in them; so is it the case with
heretics as well.  Whence Cyprian and those who thought with him could
not impose limits on the Catholic Church, which they would not
mutilate.  But in that they were otherwise minded we feel no fear,
seeing that we too share in their veneration for Peter; yet in that they
did not depart from unity we rejoice, seeing that we, like them, are
founded on the rock.
