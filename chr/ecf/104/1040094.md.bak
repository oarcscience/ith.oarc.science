<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—From Deliberation on the Evil and
on the Good Part It Results that Two Classes of Souls are Not to Be Held
to.  A Class of Souls Enticing to Shameful Deeds Having Been Conceded,
It Does Not Follow that These are Evil by Nature, that the Others are
Supreme Good.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p2"></span>19.  But if I had taught, or at any rate
had myself learned, that they rave and err regarding those two classes
of souls, why should I have thenceforth thought them worthy of being
heard or consulted about anything?  That I might learn hence, that these
two kinds of souls are pointed out, which in the course of deliberation
assent puts now on the evil side, now on the good?  Why is not this
rather the sign of one soul which by free will can be borne here and
there, swayed hither and thither?  For it was my own experience to feel
that I am one, considering evil and good and choosing one or the other,
but for the most part the one pleases, the other is fitting, placed in
the midst of which we fluctuate.  Nor is it to be wondered at, for we
are now so constituted that through the flesh we can be affected by
sensual pleasure, and through the spirit by honorable considerations. 
Am I not therefore compelled to acknowledge two souls?  Nay, we can
better and with far less difficulty recognize two classes of good
things, of which neither is alien from God as its author, one soul acted
upon from diverse directions, the lower and the higher, or to speak more
correctly, the external and the internal.  These are the two <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span id="iv.vi.xiv-Page_106"></span>classes
which a little while ago we considered under the names sensible and
intelligible, which we now prefer to call more familiarly carnal and
spiritual.  But it has been made difficult for us to abstain from carnal
things, since our truest bread is spiritual.  For with great labor we
now eat this bread.  For neither without punishment for the sin of
transgression have we been changed from immortal into mortal.  So it
happens, that when we strive after better things, habit formed by
connection with the flesh and our sins in some way begin to militate
against us and to put obstacles in our way, some foolish persons with
most obtuse superstition suspect that there is another kind of souls
which is not of God.

<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p3"></span>20.  However even if it be conceded to
them that we are enticed to shameful deeds by another inferior kind of
souls, they do not thence make it evident that those enticing are evil
by nature, or those enticed, supremely good.  For it may be, the former
of their own will, by striving after what was not lawful, that is, by
sinning, from being good have become evil; and again they may be made
good, but in such manner that for a long time they remain in sin, and by
a certain occult suasion traduce to themselves other souls.  Then, they
may not be absolutely evil, but in their own kind, however inferior,
they may exercise their own functions without any sin.  But those
superior souls to whom justice, the directress of things, has assigned a
far more excellent activity, if they should wish to follow and to
imitate those inferior ones, become evil, not because they imitate evil
souls, but because they imitate in an evil way.  By the evil souls is
done what is proper to them, by the good what is alien to them is
striven after.  Hence the former remain in their own grade, the latter
are plunged into a lower.  It is as when men copy after beasts.  For the
four-footed horse walks beautifully, but if a man on all fours should
imitate him, who would think him worthy even of chaff for food?  Rightly
therefore we generally disapprove of one who imitates, while we approve
of him whom he imitates.  But we disapprove not because he has not
succeeded, but for wishing to succeed at all.  For in the horse we
approve of that to which by as much as we prefer man, by so much are we
offended that he copies after inferior creatures.  So among men, however
well the crier may do in sending forth his voice, would not the senator
be insane, if he should do it even more clearly and better than the
crier?  Take an illustration from the heavenly bodies:  The moon when
shining is praised, and by its course and its changes is quite pleasing
to those that pay attention to such things.  But if the sun should wish
to imitate it (for we may feign that it has desires of this sort <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214) .md), who would not be greatly and
rightly displeased.  From which illustrations I wish it to be
understood, that even if there are souls (which meanwhile is left an
open question <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215) .md) devoted to
bodily offices not by sin but by nature, and even if they are related to
us, however inferior they may be, by some inner affinity, they should
not be esteemed evil simply because we are evil ourselves in following
them and in loving corporeal things.  For we sin by loving corporeal
things, because by justice we are required and by nature we are able to
love spiritual things, and when we do this we are, in our kind, the best
and the happiest.  <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md)

<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p7"></span>21.  Wherefore what proof does
deliberation, violently urged in both directions, now prone to sin, now
borne on toward right conduct, furnish, that we are compelled to accept
two kinds of souls, the nature of one of which is from God, of the other
not; when we are free to conjecture so many other causes of alternating
states of mind?  But that these things are obscure and are to no purpose
pried into by blear-eyed minds, whoever is a good judge of things sees. 
Wherefore those things rather which have been said regarding the will
and sin, those things, I say, that supreme justice permits no man using
his reason to be ignorant of, those things which if they were taken from
us, there is nothing whence the discipline of virtue may begin, nothing
whence it may rise from the death of vices, those things I say
considered again and again with sufficient clearness and lucidity
convince us that the heresy of the Manichæans is false.

<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p4"></span> Augustin’s carefulness to explain that
he is only indulging in personification is doubtless due to the fact
that with the Manichæans the sun and the moon were objects of
worship.—A.H.N.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[106:216](1040094.htm#fr_215.md) <span
id="iv.vi.xiv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p5"></span> In his *Retractations*, Augustin
explains that he did not really regard this as an open question, but
speaks of it as such only so far as this particular discussion is
concerned.  He simply declines to enter upon a consideration of it in
this connection.—A.H.N.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[106:217](1040094.htm#fr_216.md) <span
id="iv.vi.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.xiv-p6"></span> Here also the use of the word "nature"
gave Augustin trouble in his later years.  He claims in the
*Retractations* that he uses the word in the sense of "nature that has
been healed" and that "cannot be vitiated," and seeks to show that he
did not mean to exclude divine grace.—A.H.N.
