<span id="v.iv.vii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> 8.—9.  Wherefore, as the
apostle said of the law, "The law is good, if a man use it
lawfully," <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md) so we may fairly
say of baptism, Baptism is good, if a man use it lawfully.  And as they
who used the law unlawfully could not in that case cause that it should
not be in itself good, or make it null and void, so any one who uses
baptism unlawfully, either because he lives in heresy, or because he
lives the worst of lives, yet cannot cause that the baptism should be
otherwise than good, or altogether null and void.  And so, when he is
converted either to Catholic unity, or to a mode of living worthy of so
great a sacrament, he begins to have not another and a lawful baptism,
but that same baptism in a lawful manner.  Nor does the remission of
irrevocable sins follow on baptism, unless a man not only have lawful
baptism, but have it lawfully; and yet it does not follow that if a man
have it not lawfully, so that his sins are either not remitted, or,
being remitted, are brought on him again, therefore the sacrament of
baptism should be in the baptized person either bad or null and void. 
For as Judas, to whom the Lord gave a morsel, gave a place within
himself of the devil, not by re<span id="page_467">p. 467</span> <span
id="v.iv.vii.viii-Page_467"></span>ceiving what was bad, but by
receiving it badly, <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) so each
person, on receiving the sacrament of the Lord, does not cause that it
is bad because he is bad himself, or that he has received nothing
because he has not received it to salvation.  For it was none the less
the body of the Lord and the blood of the Lord, even in those to whom
the apostle said, "He that eateth unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself." <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md)   Let
the heretics therefore seek in the Catholic Church not what they have,
but what they have not,—that is, the end of the commandment, without
which many holy things may be possessed, but they cannot profit.  "Now,
the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good
conscience, and of faith unfeigned." <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md)   Let them therefore hasten to the
unity and truth of the Catholic Church, not that they may have the
sacrament of washing, if they have been already bathed in it, although
in heresy, but that they may have it to their health.
