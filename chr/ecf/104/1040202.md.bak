<span id="iv.x.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Hyle, Which Was Called by the
Ancients the Formless Material of Things, is Not an Evil.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xx-p2"></span>For neither is that material, which the
ancients called *Hyle*, to be called an evil.  I do not say that which
Manichæus with most senseless vanity, not knowing what he says,
denominates *Hyle*, namely, the former of corporeal beings; whence it is
rightly said to him, that he introduces another god.  For nobody can
form and create corporeal beings but God alone; for neither are they
created unless there subsist with them measure, form, and order, which I
think that now even they themselves confess to be good things, and
things that cannot be except from God.  But by *Hyle* I mean a certain
material absolutely formless and without quality, whence those qualities
that we perceive are formed, as the ancients said.  For hence also wood
is called in Greek <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.x.xx-p2.1"></span>
ὕλη</span>, because it is adapted to workmen, not that itself may make
anything, but that it is the material of which something may be made. 
Nor is that *Hyle*, therefore, to be called an evil which cannot be
perceived through any appearance, but can scarcely be thought of through
any sort of privation of appearance.  For this has also a capacity of
forms; for if it cannot receive the form imposed by the workman, neither
assuredly may it be called material.  Hence if form is some good, whence
those who excel in it are called beautiful, <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) as from appearance they are called
handsome, <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) even the capacity
of form is undoubtedly something good.  As because wisdom is a good, no
one doubts that to be capable of wisdom is a good.  And because every
good is from God, no one ought to doubt that even matter, if there is
any, has its existence from God alone.
