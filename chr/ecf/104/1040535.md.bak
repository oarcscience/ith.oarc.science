<span id="v.v.iv.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—</span>111.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xlviii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span>
said:  "Yet that you should not call yourselves holy, in the first
place, I declare that no one has holiness who has not led a life of
innocence."

<span id="v.v.iv.xlviii-p2"></span>112.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xlviii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Show us the
tribunal where you have been enthroned as judge, that the whole world
should stand for trial before you, and with what eyes you have inspected
and discussed, I do not say the consciences, but even the acts of all
men, that you should say that the whole world has lost its innocence. 
He who was carried up as far as the third heaven says, "Yea, I judge not
mine own self;"  <span id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130.md) and do you
venture to pronounce sentence on the whole world, throughout which the
inheritance of Christ is spread abroad?  In the next place, if what you
have said appears to you to be sufficiently certain, that "no one has
holiness who has not led a life of innocence," I would ask you, if Saul
had not the holiness of the sacrament, what was in him that David
reverenced?  But if he had innocence, why did he persecute the
innocent?  For it was on account of the sanctity <span id="page_560">p.
560</span> <span id="v.v.iv.xlviii-Page_560"></span>of his anointing
that David honored him while alive, and avenged him after he was dead;
and because he cut off so much as a scrap from his garment, he trembled
with a panic-stricken heart.  Here you see that Saul had not innocence,
and yet he had holiness,—not the personal holiness of a holy life (for
that no one can have without innocence), but the holiness of the
sacrament of God, which is holy even in unrighteous men.
