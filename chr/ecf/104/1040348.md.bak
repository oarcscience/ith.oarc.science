<span id="v.iv.vii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—</span>31.  Cyprian writes
also to Pompeius <span id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) about this
selfsame matter, and clearly shows in that letter that Stephen, who, as
we learn, was then bishop of the <span id="page_475">p. 475</span> <span
id="v.iv.vii.xxiii-Page_475"></span>Roman Church, not only did not agree
with him upon the points before us, but even wrote and taught the
opposite views.  But Stephen certainly did not "communicate with
heretics," <span id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) merely because he
did not dare to impugn the baptism of Christ, which he knew remained
perfect in the midst of their perversity.  For if none have baptism who
entertain false views about God, it has been proved sufficiently, in my
opinion, that this may happen even within the Church.  "The apostles,"
indeed, "gave no injunctions on the point;" <span
id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) but the custom, which is opposed to
Cyprian, may be supposed to have had its origin in apostolic tradition,
just as there are many things which are observed by the whole Church,
and therefore are fairly held to have been enjoined by the apostles,
which yet are not mentioned in their writings.

<span id="v.iv.vii.xxiii-p5"></span>32.  But it will be urged that it is
written of heretics that "they are condemned of themselves." <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md)   What then? are they not also
condemned of themselves to whom it was said, "For wherein thou judgest
another, thou condemnest thyself?" <span
id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md)   But to these the apostle says,
"Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?" <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md) and so forth.  And such truly were
they who, being bishops and established in Catholic unity with Cyprian
himself, used to plunder estates by treacherous frauds, preaching all
the time to the people the words of the apostle, who says, "Nor shall
extortioners inherit the kingdom of God." <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md)

<span id="v.iv.vii.xxiii-p10"></span>33.  Wherefore I will do no more
than run shortly through the other sentiments founded on the same rules,
which are in the aforesaid letter written to Pompeius.  By what
authority of holy Scripture is it shown that "it is against the
commandment of God that persons coming from the society of heretics, if
they have already there received the baptism of Christ, are not baptized
again?" <span id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md)   But it is clearly
shown that many pretended Christians, though they are not joined in the
same bond of charity with the saints, without which anything holy that
they may have been able to possess is of no profit to them, yet have
baptism in common with the saints, as has been already sufficiently
proved with the greatest fullness.  He says "that the Church, and the
Spirit, and baptism, are mutually incapable of separation from each
other, and therefore" he wishes that "those who are separated from the
Church and the Holy Spirit should be understood to be separated also
from baptism." <span id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md)   But if this
is the case, then when any one has received baptism in the Catholic
Church, it remains so long in him as he himself remains in the Church,
which is not so.  For it is not restored to him when he returns, just
because he did not lose it when he seceded.  But as the disaffected sons
have not the Holy Spirit in the same manner as the beloved sons, and yet
they have baptism; so heretics also have not the Church as Catholics
have, and yet they have baptism.  "For the Holy Spirit of discipline
will flee deceit," <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) and yet
baptism will not flee from it.  And so, as baptism can continue in one
from whom the Holy Spirit withdraws Himself, so can baptism continue
where the Church is not.  But if "the laying on of hands" were not
"applied to one coming from heresy," <span
id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md) he would be as it were judged to be
wholly blameless; but for the uniting of love, which is the greatest
gift of the Holy Spirit, without which any other holy thing that there
may be in a man is profitless to his salvation, hands are laid on
heretics when they are brought to a knowledge of the truth. <span
