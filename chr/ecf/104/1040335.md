<span id="v.iv.vii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—</span>12.  I ask, therefore, if
sins were remitted by the baptism of John, what more could the baptism
of Christ confer on those whom the Apostle Paul desired to be baptized
with the baptism of Christ after they had received the baptism of John? 
But if sins were not remitted by the baptism of John, were those men in
the days of Cyprian better than John, of whom he says himself that they
"used to seize on estates by treacherous frauds, and increase their
gains by accumulated usuries," <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) through whose, administration of
baptism the remission of sins was yet conferred?  Or was it because they
were contained within the unity of the Church?  What then?  Was John not
contained within that unity, the friend of the Bridegroom, the preparer
of the way of the Lord, the baptizer of the Lord Himself?  Who will be
mad enough to assert this?  Wherefore, although my belief is that John
so baptized with the water of repentance for the remission of sins, that
those who were baptized by him received the expectation of the remission
of their sins, the actual remission taking place in the baptism of the
Lord,—just as the resurrection which is expected at the last day is
fulfilled in hope in us, as the apostle says, that "He hath raised us up
together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus;" <span id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) and again, "For we
are saved by hope;" <span id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) or as
again John himself, while he says, "I indeed baptize you with water unto
repentance, for the remission of your sins," <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) yet says, on seeing our Lord,
"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world," <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) —nevertheless I am not disposed to
contend vehemently against any one who maintains that sins were remitted
even in the baptism of John, but that some fuller sanctification was
conferred by the baptism of Christ on those whom Paul ordered to be
baptized anew. <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md)
