id="iv.viii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—Manichæus Got the
Arrangement of His Fanciful Notions from Visible Objects.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xxxiii-p2"></span>35.  For in giving to these natures
which he has learned from visible things, an arrange<span
id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span
id="iv.viii.xxxiii-Page_145"></span>ment according to his fanciful
ideas, to represent the race of darkness, Manichæus is clearly in
error.  First of all, he makes darkness productive, which is
impossible.  But, he replies, this darkness was unlike what you are
familiar with.  How, then, can you make me understand about it?  After
so many promises to give knowledge, will you force me to take your word
for it?  Suppose I believe you, this at least is certain, that if the
darkness had no form, as darkness usually has not, it could produce
nothing; if it had form, it was better than ordinary darkness:  whereas,
when you call it different from the ordinary kind, you wish us to
believe that it is worse.  You might as well say that silence, which is
the same to the ear as darkness to the eyes, produced some deaf or dumb
animals in that region; and then, in reply to the objection that silence
is not a nature, you might say that it was different silence from
ordinary silence; in a word, you might say what you pleased to those
whom you have once misled into believing you.  No doubt, the obvious
facts relating to the origin of animal life led Manichæus to say that
serpents were produced in darkness.  However, there are serpents which
have such sharp sight, and such pleasure in light, that they seem to
give evidence of the most weighty kind against this idea.  Then the idea
of swimming things in the water might easily be got here, and applied to
the fanciful objects in that region; and so of flying things in the
winds, for the motion of the lower air in this world, where birds fly,
is called wind.  Where he got the idea of the quadrupeds in fire, no one
can tell.  Still he said this deliberately, though without sufficient
thought, and from great misconception.  The reason usually given is,
that quadrupeds are voracious and salacious.  But many men surpass any
quadruped in voracity, though they are bipeds, and are called children
of the smoke, and not of fire.  Geese, too, are as voracious as any
animal; and though he might place them in fire as bipeds, or in the
water because they love to swim, or in the winds because they have wings
and sometimes fly, they certainly have nothing to do with fire in this
classification.  As regards salaciousness, I suppose he was thinking of
neighing horses, which sometimes bite through the bridle and rush at the
mares; and writing hastily, with this in his mind, he forgot the common
sparrow, in comparison of which the hottest stallion is cold.  The
reason they give for assigning bipeds to the smoke is, that bipeds are
conceited and proud, for men are derived from this class; and the idea,
which is a plausible one, is that smoke resembles proud people in rising
up into the air, round and swelling.  This idea might warrant a
figurative description of proud men, or an allegorical expression or
explanation, but not the belief that bipeds are born in smoke and of
smoke.  They might with equal reason be said to be born in dust, for it
often rises up to the heaven with a similar circling and lofty motion;
or in the clouds, for they are often drawn up from the earth in such a
way, that those looking from a distance are uncertain whether they are
clouds or smoke.  Once more, why, in the case of the waters and the
winds, does he suit the inhabitants to the character of the place, as we
see swimming things in water, and flying things in the wind; whereas, in
the face of fire and smoke, this bold liar is not ashamed to assign to
these places the most unlikely inhabitants?  For fire burns quadrupeds,
and consumes them, and smoke suffocates and kills bipeds.  At least he
must acknowledge that he has made these natures better in the race of
darkness than they are here, though he wishes us to think everything to
be worse.  For, according to this, the fire there produced and nourished
quadrupeds, and gave them a lodging not only harmless, but most
convenient.  The smoke, too, provided room for the offspring of its own
benign bosom, and cherished them up to the rank of prince.  Thus we see
that these lies, which have added to the number of heretics, arose from
the perception by carnal sense, only without care or discernment, of
visible objects in this world, and when thus conceived, were brought
forth by fancy, and then presumptuously written and published.
