id="iv.ix.vi-p1.1"></span>Book IV.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.vi-p2"></span>Faustus’s reasons for rejecting the Old
Testament, and Augustin’s animadversions thereon.

<span id="iv.ix.vi-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.vi-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  Do I believe the Old
Testament?  If it bequeaths anything to me, I believe it; if not, I
reject it.  It would be an excess of forwardness to take the documents
of others which pronounce me disinherited.  Remember that the promise of
Canaan in the Old Testament is made to Jews, that is, to the
circumcised, who offer sacrifice, and abstain from swine’s flesh, and
from the other animals which Moses pronounces unclean, and observe
Sabbaths, and the feast of unleavened bread, and other things of the
same kind which the author of the Testament enjoined.  Christians have
not adopted these observances, and no one keeps them; so that if we will
not take the inheritance, we should surrender the documents.  This is my
first reason for rejecting the Old Testament, unless you teach me
better.  My second reason is, that this inheritance is such a poor
fleshly thing, without any spiritual blessings, that after the New
Testament, and its glorious promise of the kingdom of heaven and eternal
life, I think it not worth the taking.

<span id="iv.ix.vi-p4"></span>2.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.vi-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  No one doubts that
promises of temporal things are contained in the Old Testament, for
which reason it is called the Old Testament; or that the kingdom of
heaven and the promise of eternal life belong to the New Testament.  But
that in these temporal things were figures of future things which should
be fulfilled in us upon whom the ends of the ages are come, is not my
fancy, but the judgment of the apostle, when he says of such things,
"These things were our examples;" and again, "These things happened to
them for an example, and they are written for us on whom the ends of the
ages are come." <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md)   We receive the
Old Testament, therefore, not in order to obtain the fulfillment of
these promises, but to see in them predictions of the New Testament; for
the Old bears witness to the New.  Whence the Lord, after He rose from
the dead, and allowed His disciples not only to see but to handle Him,
still, lest they should doubt their mortal and fleshly senses, gave them
further confirmation from the testimony of the ancient books, saying,
"It was necessary that all things should be fulfilled which were written
in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets and Psalms, concerning
me." <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md)  Our hope, therefore, rests
not on the promise of temporal <span id="page_162">p. 162</span> <span
id="iv.ix.vi-Page_162"></span>things.  Nor do we believe that the holy
and spiritual men of these times—the patriarchs and prophets—were taken
up with earthly things.  For they understood, by the revelation of the
Spirit of God, what was suitable for that time, and how God appointed
all these sayings and actions as types and predictions of the future. 
Their great desire was for the New Testament; but they had a personal
duty to perform in those predictions, by which the new things of the
future were foretold.  So the life as well as the tongue of these men
was prophetic.  The carnal people, indeed, thought only of present
blessings, though even in connection with the people there were
prophecies of the future.

<span id="iv.ix.vi-p7"></span>These things you do not understand,
because, as the prophet said, "Unless you believe, you shall not
understand." <span id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md)   For you are not
instructed in the kingdom of heaven,—that is, in the true Catholic
Church of Christ.  If you were, you would bring forth from the treasure
of the sacred Scriptures things old as well as new.  For the Lord
Himself says, "Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of
heaven is like an householder who brings forth from his treasure things
new and old." <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md)   And so, while
you profess to receive only the new promises of God, you have retained
the oldness of the flesh, adding only the novelty of error; of which
novelty the apostle says, "Shun profane novelties of words, for they
increase unto more ungodliness, and their speech eats like a cancer.  Of
whom is Hymenæus and Philetus, who concerning the faith have erred,
saying that the resurrection is past already, and have overthrown the
faith of some."  <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md)   Here you see
the source of your false doctrine, in teaching that the resurrection is
only of souls by the preaching of the truth, and that there will be no
resurrection of the body.  But how can you understand spiritual things
of the inner man, who is renewed in the knowledge of God, when in the
oldness of the flesh, if you do not possess temporal things, you concoct
fanciful notions about them in those images of carnal things of which
the whole of your false doctrine consists?  You boast of despising as
worthless the land of Canaan, which was an actual thing, and actually
given to the Jews; and yet you tell of a land of light cut asunder on
one side, as by a narrow wedge, by the land of the race of darkness,—a
thing which does not exist, and which you believe from the delusion of
your minds; so that your life is not supported by having it, and your
mind is wasted in desiring it. <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md)
