<span id="v.v.iv.cii"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.cii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.cii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 102.—</span>231.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.cii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"You, therefore, who prefer rather to be washed with the most false of
baptisms than to be regenerate, not only do not lay aside your sins, but
also load your souls with the offenses of criminals.  For as the water
of the guilty has been abandoned by the Holy Spirit, so it is clearly
filled full of the offenses of the *traditors*.  To any wretched man,
then, who is baptized by one of this sort, we would say, If you have
wished to be free from falsehood, you are really drenched with falsity. 
If you desired to shut out the sins of the flesh, you will, as the
conscience of the guilty comes upon you, be partakers likewise of their
guilt.  If you wished to extinguish the flames of avarice, you are
drenched with deceit, you are drenched with wickedness, you are drenched
also with madness.  Lastly, if you believe that faith is identical in
the giver and the receiver, you are drenched with the blood of a brother
by him who slays a man.  And so it comes to pass that you, who had come
to baptism free from sin, return from baptism guilty of the sin of
murder."

<span id="v.v.iv.cii-p2"></span>232.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.cii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I should like to
come to argument with those who shouted assent when they either heard or
read those words of yours.  For such men have not ears in their hearts,
but their heart in their ears.  Yet let them read again and again, and
consider, and find out for themselves, not what the sound of those words
is, but what they mean.  First of all, to sift the meaning of the last
clause, "So it comes to pass," you say, "that you who had come to
baptism free from sin, return from baptism guilty of the sin of
murder:"  tell me, to begin with, who there is that comes to baptism
free from sin, with the single exception of Him who came to be baptized,
not that His iniquity should be purged away, but that an example of
humility might be given us?  For what shall be forgiven to one free from
sin?  Or are you indeed endowed with such an eloquence, that you can
show to us some innocence which yet committeth sin?  Do you not hear the
words of Scripture saying, "No one is clean from sin in Thy sight, not
even the infant whose life is but of a single day upon the earth?" <span
id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md)   For whence else is it that one
hastens even with infants to seek remission of their sins?  Do you not
hear the words of another Scripture, "In sin did my mother conceive
me?" <span id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md)   In the next place, if
a man returns a murderer, who had come without the guilt of murder,
merely because he receives baptism at a murderer’s hands, then all they
who returned from receiving baptism at the hands of Optatus were made
partakers with Optatus.  Go now, and see with what face you cast in our
teeth that we excite the wrath of kings against you.  Are you not afraid
that as many satellites of Gildo will be sought for among you, as there
are men who may have been baptized by Optatus?  Do you see at length how
that sentence of yours, like an empty bladder, has rattled not only with
a meaningless sound, but on your own head?

<span id="v.v.iv.cii-p5"></span>233.  To go on to the other earlier
arguments which you have set before us to be refuted, they are of such a
nature that we must needs allow that every one returns from baptism
endued with the character of him by whom he is baptized; but God forbid
that those whom you baptize should return from you infected with the
same madness as possesses you when you make such a statement!  And what
a dainty sound there was in your words, "You are drenched with deceit,
you are drenched with wickedness, you are drenched also with madness!" 
Surely you would never pour forth words like this unless you were, not
drenched, but filled even to repletion with madness.  Is it then true,
to say nothing of the rest, that all who come untainted with
covetousness to receive baptism at the hands of your covetous
colleagues, or the priests of your party, return guilty of covetousness,
and that those who run in <span id="page_590">p. 590</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.cii-Page_590"></span>soberness to the whirlpool of
intoxication to be baptized return in drunkenness?  If you entertain and
teach such views as this, you will have the effrontery even to quote, as
making against us, the passage which you advanced some little time ago: 
"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.  It is
better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes." <span
id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md)   What is the meaning of your
teaching, I would ask, save only this, that we should put our confidence
not in the Lord, but in man, when you say that the baptized person is
made to resemble him who has baptized him?  And since you assume this as
the fundamental principle of your baptism, are men to place their trust
in you? and are those to place their trust in princes who were disposed
to place it in the Lord?  Truly I would bid them hearken not to you, but
rather to those proofs which you have urged against ourselves, ay, and
to words more awful yet; for not only is it written, "It is better to
trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man," but also, "Cursed be
the man that trusteth in man." <span
