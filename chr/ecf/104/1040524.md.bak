<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—</span>85.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span>
said:  "But that the truth of this may be made manifest from the
apostles, we are taught by their actions, as it is written:  ‘It came to
pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the
upper coasts, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples, he said
unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?  And they
said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy
Ghost.  And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized?  And
they said, Unto John’s baptism.  Then said Paul, John verily baptized
with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should
believe on Him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. 
When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them;
and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.  And all the men were about
twelve.’ <span id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087.md)   If, therefore,
they were baptized that they might receive the Holy Ghost, why do not
you, if you wish to receive the Holy Ghost, take measures to obtain a
true renewing, after your falsehoods?  And if we do ill in urging this,
why do you seek after us? or at any rate, if it is an offense, condemn
Paul in the first instance; the Paul who certainly washed off what had
already existed, whereas we in you give baptism which as yet does not
exist.  For you do not, as we have often said before, wash with a true
baptism; but you bring on men an ill repute by your empty name of a
false baptism."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p3"></span>86.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  "We bring no
accusation against Paul, who gave to men the baptism of Christ because
they had not the baptism of Christ, but the baptism of John, according
to their own reply; for, being asked, Unto what were ye baptized? they
answered, Unto John’s baptism; which has nothing to do with the baptism
of Christ, and is neither a part of it nor a step towards it. 
Otherwise, either at that time the water of the baptism of Christ was
renewed a second time, or if the baptism of Christ was then made perfect
by the two waters, the baptism is less perfect which is given now,
because it is not given with the water which was given at the hands of
John.  But either one of these opinions it is impious and sacrilegious
to entertain.  Therefore Paul gave the baptism of Christ to those who
had not the baptism of Christ, but only the baptism of John.

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p4"></span>87.  But why the baptism of John,
which is not necessary now, was necessary at that time, I have explained
elsewhere; and the question has no bearing on the point at issue between
us at the present time, except so far as that it may appear that the
baptism of John was one thing, the baptism of Christ another,—just as
that baptism was a different thing with which the apostle says that our
fathers were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, when they passed
through the Red Sea under the guidance of Moses. <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088.md)   For the law and the prophets up
to the time of John the Baptist had sacraments which foreshadowed things
to come; but the sacraments of our <span id="page_553">p. 553</span>
<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-Page_553"></span>time bear testimony that that
has come already which the former sacraments foretold should come.  John
therefore was a foreteller of Christ nearer to Him in time than all who
went before him.  And because all the righteous men and prophets of
former times desired to see the fulfillment of what, through the
revelation of the Spirit, they foresaw would come to pass,—whence also
the Lord Himself says, "That many prophets and righteous men have
desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to
hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them," <span
id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089.md) —therefore it was said of John that
he was more than a prophet, and that among all that were born of women
there was none greater than he; <span
id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090.md) because to the righteous men who
went before him it was only granted to foretell the coming of Christ,
but to John it was given both to foretell Him in His absence and to
behold His presence, so that it should be found that to him was made
manifest what the others had desired.  And therefore the sacrament of
his baptism is still connected with the foretelling of Christ’s coming,
though as of something very soon to be fulfilled, seeing that up to his
time there were still foretellings of the first coming of our Lord, of
which coming we have now announcements, but no longer predictions.  But
the Lord, teaching the way of humility, condescended to make use of the
sacraments which He found here in reference to the foretelling of His
coming, not in order to assist the operation of His cleansing, but as an
example for our piety, that so He might show to us with what reverence
we ought to receive those sacraments which bear witness that He is
already come, when He did not disdain to make use of those which
foreshadowed His coming in the future.  And John, therefore, though the
nearest to Christ in point of time, and within one year of the same age
with Him, yet, while he was baptizing, went before the way of Christ who
was still to come; for which reason it was said of him, "Behold, I send
my messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before
Thee." <span id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091.md)   And he himself
preached, saying, "There cometh one mightier than I after me." <span
id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092.md)   In like manner, therefore, the
circumcision on the eighth day, which was given to the patriarchs,
foretold our justification, to the putting away of carnal lusts through
the resurrection of our Lord, which took place after the seventh day,
which is the Sabbath-day, on the eighth, that is, the Lord’s day, which
fell on the third day after His burial; yet the infant Christ received
the same circumcision of the flesh, with its prophetic signification. 
And as the Passover, which was celebrated by the Jews with the slaying
of a lamb, prefigured the passion of our Lord and His departure from
this world to the Father, yet the same Lord celebrated the same Passover
with His disciples, when they reminded Him of it, saying, Where wilt
Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover? <span
id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093.md) so too He Himself also received the
baptism of John, which formed a part of the latest foretelling of His
coming.  But as the Jews’ circumcision of the flesh is one thing, and
the ceremony which we observe on the eighth day after persons are
baptized is another; <span id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094.md) and the
Passover which the Jews still celebrate with the slaying of a lamb is
one thing, <span id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095.md) and that which we
receive in the body and blood of our Lord is another,—so the baptism of
John was one thing, the baptism of Christ is another.  For by the former
series of rites the latter were foretold as destined to arrive; by these
latter the others are declared to be fulfilled.  And even though Christ
received the others, yet are they not necessary for us, who have
received the Lord Himself who was foretold in them.  But when the coming
of our Lord was as yet recent, it was necessary for any one who had
received the former that he should be imbued with the latter also; but
it was wholly needless that any one who had been so imbued should be
compelled to go back to the former rites.

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p13"></span>88.  Wherefore do not seek to raise
confusion out of the baptism of John, the source and intention of which
was either such as I have here set forth; or if any other better
explanation of it can be given, this much still is clear, that the
baptism of John and the baptism of Christ are two distinct and separate
things, and that the former was expressly called the baptism of John, as
is clear both from the answer of those men whose case you quoted, and
from the words of our Lord Himself, when he says, "The baptism of John,
whence was it? from heaven, or of men?" <span
id="fr_2096"></span>[2097](#fn_2096.md)   But the latter is never called
the baptism of Cæcilianus, or of Donatus, or of Augustin, or of
Petilianus, but the baptism of Christ.  For if you think that we are
shameless, because we will not allow that any one should be bap<span
id="page_554">p. 554</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-Page_554"></span>tized after baptism from us, although
we see that men were baptized again who had received the baptism of
John, who certainly is incomparably greater than ourselves, will you
maintain that John and Optatus were of equal dignity?  The thing appears
ridiculous.  And yet I fancy that you do not hold them to be equals, but
consider Optatus the greater of the two.  For the apostle baptized after
baptism by John:  you venture to baptize no one after baptism by
Optatus.  Was it because Optatus was in unity with you?  I know not with
what heart a theory like this can be maintained, if the friend of the
Count, <span id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097.md) who had in the Count a
god for his companion, is said to have been in unity, and the friend of
the Bridegroom to have been excluded from it.  But if John was
preeminently in unity, and far more excellent and greater than all of us
and all of you, and yet the Apostle Paul baptized after him, why do you
then not baptize after Optatus?  Unless indeed it be that your blindness
brings you into such a strait that you should say that Optatus had the
power of giving the Holy Spirit, and that John had not!  And if you do
not say this, for fear of being ridiculed for your madness even by the
insane themselves, what answer will you be able to make when you are
asked why men should have required to be baptized after receiving
baptism from John, while no one needs to be baptized after receiving it
from Optatus, unless it be that the former were baptized with the
baptism of John, while, whenever any one is baptized with the baptism of
Christ, whether he be baptized by Paul or by Optatus, there is no
difference in the nature of his baptism, though there is so great a
difference between Paul and Optatus?  Return then, O ye transgressors,
to a right mind, <span id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098.md) and do not
seek to weigh the sacraments of God by considerations of the characters
and deeds of men.  For the sacraments are holy through Him to whom they
belong; but when taken in hand worthily, they bring reward, when
unworthily, judgment.  And although the men are not one who take in hand
the sacrament of God worthily or unworthily, yet that which is taken in
hand, whether worthily or unworthily, is the same; so that it does not
become better or worse in itself, but only turns to the life or death of
those who handle it in either case.  And in respect of what you said,
that "in those whom Paul baptized after they had received the baptism of
John, he washed off what had already existed," you certainly would not
have said it had you taken a moment to consider what you were saying. 
For if the baptism of John required washing off, it must, beyond all
doubt, have had some foulness in it.  Why then should I press you
further?  Recollect or read, and see whence John received it, so shall
you see against whom you have uttered that blasphemy; and when you have
discovered this, your heart will surely be beaten, if a rein be not set
on your tongue.

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p17"></span>89.  To come next to what you think
you say against us with so much point:  "If we do ill in urging this,
why do you seek after us?" cannot you even yet call to mind that only
those are sought after who have perished?  Or is the incapacity for
seeing this an element in your ruin?  For the sheep might say to the
shepherd with equal absurdity, If I do wrong in straying from the flock,
why do you search after me? not understanding that the very reason why
it is being sought is because it thinks there is no need for seeking
it.  But who is there that seeks for you, either through His Scriptures,
or by catholic and conciliatory voices, or by the scourgings of temporal
afflictions, save only Him who dispenses that mercy to you in all
things?  We therefore seek you that we may find you; for we love you
that you should have life, with the same intensity with which we hate
your error, that it might be destroyed which seeks to ruin you, so long
as it is not itself involved in your destruction.  And would to God that
we might seek you in such a manner as even to find, and be able to say
with rejoicing of each one of you, "He was dead, and is alive again; he
was lost, and is found!" <span id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099.md)

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p11"></span> In his treatise on the Sermon on
the Mount, Book I. iv. 12, Augustin again compares the *"celebratio
octavarum feriarum quas in regeneratione novi hominis celebramus"* with
the circumcision on the eighth day; and in *Serm*. 376, c. ii. 2, he
says that the heads of the infants were uncovered on the eighth day, as
a token of liberty.  Cp. Bingham, *Orig. Sacr*. XII. iv. 3.

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxvii-p12"></span> Augustin apparently supposed that
the sacrifice of the paschal lamb was still observed among the Jews of
the dispersion; cp. *Retract*. I. x. 2.  It was, however, forbidden them
to sacrifice the Passover except in the place which the Lord should
choose to place His name there; and hence the Jews, though they observe
the other paschal solemnities, abstain from the sacrifice of the lamb.
