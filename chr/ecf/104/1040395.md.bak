<span id="v.iv.viii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—</span>79.  Also another
Januarius of Muzuli <span id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md) said:  "I
wonder that, while all acknowledge that there is one baptism, all do not
understand the unity of the same baptism.  For the Church and heresy are
two distinct things.  If heretics have baptism we have it not; but if we
have it, heretics cannot have it.  But there is no doubt that the Church
alone possesses the baptism of Christ, since it alone possesses both the
favor and the truth of Christ." <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xli-p4"></span>80.  Another might equally say, and
say with equal want of truth:  I wonder that, while all confess there is
one baptism, all do not understand the unity of baptism.  For
righteousness and unrighteousness are two distinct things.  If the
unrighteous have baptism, the righteous have it not; but if the
righteous have it, the unrighteous cannot have it.  But there is no
doubt that the righteous alone possess the baptism of Christ, since they
alone possess both the favor and the truth of Christ.  This is certainly
false, as they confess themselves.  For those envious ones also who are
of the party of the devil, though placed within the Church, as Cyprian
tells us, and who were well known to the Apostle Paul, had baptism, but
did not belong to the members of that dove which is safely sheltered on
the rock.
