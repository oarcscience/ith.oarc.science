<span id="v.v.iv.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—</span>103.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xliv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"For we, as it is written, when we are baptized, put on Christ who was
betrayed; <span id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122.md) you, when you are
infected, put on Judas the betrayer."

<span id="v.v.iv.xliv-p3"></span>104.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xliv-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I also might
say, You when you are infected put on Optatus the betrayer, the robber,
the oppressor, the separater of husband and wife; but far be it from me
that the desire of returning an evil word should provoke me into any
falsehood:  for neither do you put on Optatus, nor we Judas.  Therefore,
if each one who comes to us shall answer to our questions that he has
been baptized in the name of Optatus, he shall be baptized in the name
of Christ; and if you baptized any that came from us and said that they
had been baptized in the name of the traitor Judas, in that case we have
no fault to find with what you have done.  But if they had been baptized
in the name of Christ, do you not see what an error you commit in
thinking that the sacraments of God can undergo change through any
changeableness of human sins, or be polluted by defilement in the life
of any man?
