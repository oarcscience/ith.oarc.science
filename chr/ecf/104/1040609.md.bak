<span id="v.v.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—</span>13.  For I am a man of the
threshing-floor of Christ:  if a bad man, then part of the chaff; if
good, then of the grain.  The winnowing-fan of this threshing-floor is
not the tongue of Petilianus; and hereby, whatever evil he may have
uttered, even with truth, against the chaff of this threshing-floor,
this in no way prejudices its grain.  But whereinsoever he has cast any
revilings or calumnies against the grain itself, its faith is tried on
earth, and its reward increased in the heavens.  For where men are holy
servants of the Lord, and are fighting with holiness for God, not
against Petilianus, or any flesh and blood like him, but against
principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this
world, <span id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) such as are all
enemies of the truth, to whom I would that we could say, "Ye were
sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord," <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) —where the servants of God, I say,
are waging such a war as this, then all the calumnious revilings that
are uttered by their enemies, which cause an evil report among the
malicious and those that are rash in believing, are weapons on the left
hand:  it is with such as these that even the devil is defeated.  For
when we are tried by good report, whether we resist the exaltation of
ourselves to pride, and are tried by evil report, whether we love even
those very enemies by whom it is invented against us, then we overcome
the devil by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the
left.  For when the apostle had used the expression, "By the armor of
righteousness on the right hand and on the left," he at once goes on to
say, as if in explanation of the terms, "By honor and dishonor, by evil
report and good report," <span id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) and
so forth,—reckoning honor and good report among the armor on the right
hand, dishonor and evil report among that upon the left.
