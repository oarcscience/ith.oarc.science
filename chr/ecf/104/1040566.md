<span id="v.v.iv.lxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 79.—</span>173.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxxix-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"And again, ‘Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself
unseemly, seeketh not her own.’  But you seek what belongs to other
men.  ‘Is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in
iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, endureth all
things.  Charity never faileth.’  <span
id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184)   This is to say, in short, Charity
does not persecute, does not inflame emperors to take away the lives of
other men; does not plunder other men’s goods; does not go on to murder
men whom it has spoiled."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxix-p3"></span>174.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxix-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  How often must
I tell you the same thing?  If you do not prove these charges, they tell
against no one in the world; and if you prove them, they have no bearing
upon us; just as those things have no bearing upon you which are daily
done by the furious deeds of the insane, by the luxury of the drunken,
by the blindness of the suicides, by the tyranny of robbers.  For who
can fail to see that what I say is true?  But now if charity were in
you, it would rejoice in the truth.  For how neatly it is said under
covering of the sheep’s clothing, "Charity beareth all things, endureth
all things!" but when you come to the test, the wolf’s teeth cannot be
concealed.  For when, in obedience to the words of Scripture,
"forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace," <span id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185)
charity would compel you, even if you knew of any evils within the
Church, I do not say to consent to them, but yet to tolerate them if you
could not prevent them, lest, on account of the wicked who are to be
separated by the winnowing-fan at the last day, you should at the
present time sever the bond of peace by breaking off from the society of
good men, you, resisting her influence, and being cast out by the wind
of levity, charge the wheat with being chaff, and declare that what you
invent of the wicked holds good through the force of contagion even in
the righteous.  And when the Lord has said, "The field is the world, the
harvest is the end of the world," though He said of the wheat and of the
tares, "Let both grow together until the harvest," <span
id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186) you endeavor by your words to bring
about a belief that the wheat has perished throughout the main portion
of the field, and only continued to exist in your little corner,—being
desirous that Christ should be proved a liar, but you the man of truth. 
And you speak, indeed, against your own conscience; for no one who in
any way looks truly at the gospel will venture in his heart to say that
in all the many nations throughout which is heard the response of Amen,
and among whom Alleluia is sung almost with one single voice, no
Christians are to be found.  And yet, that it may not appear that the
party of Donatus, which does not communicate with the several nations of
the world, is involved in error, if any angel from heaven, who could see
the whole world, were to declare that outside your communion good and
innocent men were nowhere to be found, there is little doubt that you
would rejoice over the iniquity of the human race, and boast of having
told the truth before you had received assurance of it.  How then is
there in you that charity which rejoices not in iniquity?  But be not
deceived.  Throughout the field, that is, throughout the world, there
will be found the wheat of the Lord growing till the end of the world. 
Christ has said this:  Christ is truth.  Let charity be in you, and let
it rejoice in the truth.  Though an angel from heaven preach unto you
another gospel contrary to His gospel, let him be accursed.  <span
