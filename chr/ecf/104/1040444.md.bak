<span id="v.iv.ix.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45.—</span>88.  Also another
Aurelius of Chullabi <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) said: 
"The Apostle John has laid down in his epistle the following precept: 
‘If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him
not into your house, neither bid him God speed:  for he that biddeth him
God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.’ <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md)   How can such men be admitted
without consideration into the house of God, who are forbidden to be
admitted into our private house?  Or how can we hold communion with them
without the baptism of Christ, when, if we only so much as bid them
<span id="page_510">p. 510</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix.xlv-Page_510"></span>God speed, we are partakers of their
evil deeds?" <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xlv-p5"></span>89.  In respect of this testimony of
John there is no need of further disputation, since it has no reference
at all to the question of baptism, which we are at present discussing. 
For he says, "If any come unto you, and bring not the doctrine of
Christ."  But heretics leaving the doctrine of their error are converted
to the doctrine of Christ, that they may be incorporated with the
Church, and may begin to belong to the members of that Dove whose
sacrament they previously had; and therefore what previously they lacked
belonging to it is given to them, that is to say, peace and charity out
of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned. <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md)   But what they previously had
belonging to the Dove is acknowledged, and received without any
depreciation; just as in the adulteress God recognises His gifts, even
when she is following her lovers; because when after her fornication is
corrected she is turned again to chastity, those gifts are not laid to
her charge, but she herself is corrected. <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md)   But just as Cyprian might have
defended himself if this testimony of John had been cast in his teeth
whilst he was holding communion with men like these, so let those
against whom it is spoken make their own defense.  For to the question
before us, as I said before, it has no reference at all.  For John says
that we are not to bid God speed to men of strange doctrine; but Paul
the apostle says, with even greater vehemence, "If any man that is
called a brother be covetous, or a drunkard," or anything of the sort,
with such an one no not to eat; <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) and yet Cyprian used to admit to
fellowship, not with his private table, but with the altar of God, his
colleagues who were usurers, and treacherous, and fraudulent, and
robbers.  But in what manner this may be defended has been sufficiently
set forth in other books already.
