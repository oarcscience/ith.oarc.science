<span id="v.v.iv.cvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.cvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 107.—</span>242.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.cvii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"And that none who is a layman may claim to be free from sin, they are
all bound by this prohibition:  ‘Be not partakers of other men’s sins.’"

<span id="v.v.iv.cvii-p2"></span>243.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.cvii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  You are mistaken
*toto cælo*, as the saying is, by reason of your pride, whilst, by
reason of your humility, you are unwilling to communicate with the whole
world.  For, in the first place, this was not spoken to a layman; and,
in the second place, you are wholly ignorant in what sense it was
spoken.  The apostle, writing to Timothy, gives this warning to none
other than Timothy himself, to whom he says in another place, "Neglect
not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the
laying on of the hands of the presbytery." <span
id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md)   And by many other proofs it is
made clear that he was not a layman.  But in that he says, "Be not
partaker of other men’s sins," <span
id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) he means, Be not partaker
voluntarily, or with consent.  And hence he immediately subjoins
directions how he shall obey the injunction, saying, "Keep thyself
pure."  For neither was Paul himself partaker of other men’s sins,
because he endured false brethren, over whom he groans, in bodily unity;
nor did the apostles who preceded him partake of the thievery and crime
of Judas, because they partook of the holy supper with him when he had
already sold his Lord, and been pointed out as the traitor by that Lord.
