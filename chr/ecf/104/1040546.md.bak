<span id="v.v.iv.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 59.—</span>133.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lix-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"It is written, ‘Thou shalt not covet anything that is thy
neighbor’s.’ <span id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151.md)   You plunder
what is ours, that you may have it for your own."

<span id="v.v.iv.lix-p3"></span>134.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lix-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  All things of
which unity was in possession belong to none other than ourselves, who
remain in unity, not in accordance with the calumnies of men, but with
the words of Christ, in whom all the nations of the whole earth are
blessed.  Nor do we separate ourselves from the society of the wheat, on
account of the unrighteous men whom we cannot separate from the wheat of
the Lord before the winnowing at the judgment; and if there are any
things which you who are cut off begin already to possess, we do not,
because the Lord has given to us what has been taken away from you,
therefore covet our neighbors’ goods, seeing that they have been made
ours by the authority of Him to whom all things belong; and they are
rightly ours, for you were wont to use them for purposes of schism, but
we use them for the promotion of unity.  Otherwise your party might
reproach even the first people of God with coveting their neighbors’
goods, seeing that they were driven forth before their face by the power
of God, because they used the land amiss; and the Jews in turn
themselves, from whom the kingdom was taken away, according to the words
of the Lord, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
thereof, <span id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152.md) may bring a charge
against that nation, of coveting their neighbors’ goods, because the
Church of Christ is in possession where the persecutors of Christ were
wont to reign.  And, after all, when it has been said to yourselves, You
are coveting the goods of other men, because you have driven out from
the basilicas the followers of Maximianus, you are at a loss to find any
answer that you can make.
