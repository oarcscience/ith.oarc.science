<span id="v.v.iv.lxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 69.—</span>153.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxix-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"‘Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of
God.’ <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md)   You make a pretence
of peace by your wickedness, and seek unity by war."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxix-p3"></span>154.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxix-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  We do not make a
pretense of peace by wickedness, but we preach peace out of the gospel;
and if you were at peace with it, you would be at peace also with us. 
The risen Lord, when presenting Himself to the disciples, not only that
they should gaze on Him with their eyes, but also that they should
handle Him with their hands, began His discourse to them with the words,
"Peace be unto you."  And how this peace itself was to be maintained, He
disclosed to them in the words which followed.  For "then opened He
their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said
unto them, Thus is it written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and
to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem." <span id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md)   If you will
keep peace with these words, you will not be at variance with us.  For
if we seek unity by war, our war could not be praised in more glorious
terms, seeing that it is written, "Thou shall love thy neighbor as
thyself." <span id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md)   And again it is
written, "No man ever yet hated his own flesh." <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md)   And yet the flesh lusteth against
the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. <span
id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md)   But if no man ever yet hated his
own flesh, and yet a man lusteth against his own flesh, here you have
unity sought by war, that the body, being subject to correction, may be
brought under submission.  But what the spirit does against the flesh,
waging war with it, not in hatred but in love, this those who are
spiritual do against those who are carnal, that they may do towards them
what they do towards themselves, because they love their neighbors as
neighbors indeed.  But the war which the spiritual wage is that
correction which is in <span id="page_567">p. 567</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.lxix-Page_567"></span>love:  their sword is the word of God. 
To such a war they are aroused by the trumpet of the apostle sounding
with a mighty force:  "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of
season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and
doctrine." <span id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md)   See then that we
act not with the sword, but with the word.  But you answer what is not
true, while you accuse us falsely.  You do not correct your own faults,
and you bring against us those of other men.  Christ bears true witness
concerning the nations of the earth; you, in opposition to Christ, bear
false witness against the nations of the earth.  If we were to believe
you rather than Christ, you would call us peacemakers; because we
believe Christ rather than you, we are said to make a pretense of peace
by our wickedness.  And while you say and do such things as this, you
have the further impudence to quote the words, "Blessed are the
peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God."
