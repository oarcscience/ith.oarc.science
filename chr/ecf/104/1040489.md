id="v.v.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—</span>4.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.ii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said:  "Those who have
polluted their souls with a guilty laver, under the name of baptism,
reproach us with baptizing twice,—than whose obscenity, indeed, any kind
of filth is more cleanly, seeing that through a perversion of
cleanliness they have come to be made fouler by their washing."

<span id="v.v.iv.ii-p2"></span>5.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  We are neither
made fouler by our washing, nor cleaner by yours.  But when the water of
baptism is given to any one in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost, it is neither ours nor yours, but His of whom it
was said to John, "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and
remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost." <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967)
