<span id="v.vi.ii-p6"></span>*A Letter of Augustin* <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465) *to Boniface, who, as we learn from
Epistle 220, was Tribune, and afterwards Count in Africa.  In it
Augustin shows that the heresy of the Donatists has nothing in common
with that of Arius; and points out the moderation with which it was
possible to recall the heretics to the communion of the Church through
awe of the imperial laws.  He adds remarks concerning the savage conduct
of the Donatists and Circumcelliones, concluding with a discussion of
the unpardonable nature of the sin against the Holy Ghost*. <span

<span id="v.vi.ii-p7"></span> In Book 11. c. xlviii of his
*Retractations*, Augustin says:  "About the same time" (as that at which
he wrote his treatise *De Gestis Pelagii, i.e.*, about the year 417), "I
wrote also a treatise *De Correctione Donatistarum*, for the sake of
those who were not willing that the Donatists should be subjected to the
correction of the imperial laws."  This treatise begins with the words
*"Laudo, et gratulor, et admiror."*  This letter in the old editions was
No. 50,—the letter which is now No. 4 in the appendix (Benedictine)
being formerly No. 185.
