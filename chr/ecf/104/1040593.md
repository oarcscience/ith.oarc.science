<span id="v.v.iv.cvi"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.cvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.cvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 106.—</span>240.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.cvi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Woe unto you, therefore, who, by doing violence to what is holy, cut
away the bond of unity; whereas the prophet says, ‘If the people shall
sin, the priest shall pray for them:  but if the priest shall sin, who
will pray for him?’"

<span id="v.v.iv.cvi-p2"></span>241.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.cvi-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I seemed too a
little while ago, when we were disputing about the oil of the sinner, to
anoint your forehead, in order that you might say, if you dared, whether
you yourself were not a sinner.  You have had the hardihood to say as
much.  What a portentous sin!  For in that you assert yourself to be a
priest, what else have you maintained by quoting this testimony of the
prophet, save that you are wholly without sin?  For if you have sin, who
is there that shall pray for you, according to your understanding of the
words?  For thus you blazon yourselves among the wretched people,
quoting from the prophet:  "If the people shall sin, the priest shall
pray for them:  but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for
him? <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299) to the intent that they
may believe you to be without sin, and entrust the wiping away their
sins to your prayers.  Truly ye are great men, exalted above your
fellows, heavenly, godlike, angels indeed rather than men, who pray for
the people, and will not have the people pray for you!  Are you more
righteous than Paul, more perfect than that great apostle, who was wont
to commend himself to the prayers of those whom he taught?  "Continue,"
he says, "in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; withal
praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to
speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; that I may
make it manifest, as I ought to speak." <span
id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300)   See how prayer is made for an
apostle, which you would have not made for a bishop.  Do you perceive of
how devilish a nature your pride is?  Prayer is made for an apostle,
that he may make manifest the mystery of Christ as he ought to speak. 
Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you, you ought to have
exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not give utterance as you
ought not.  Are you more righteous than the evangelist John, who says,
"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
not in us?" <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301)   Finally, are
you more righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted in this very
epistle, going so far as to say, "The most righteous king cast forth
Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by wild beasts?"—a thing which he
never did suppose, since he said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly
spirit, as the context of the lesson shows, "Thy God, whom thou servest
continually, He will deliver thee." <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302)   But on this subject we have
already said much.  With regard to the question now before us, viz.,
that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your testimony,
though that might be sufficient for me in the argument which I hold with
you, but by the testimony of the Spirit of God, speaking also by the
mouth of Ezekiel, where he named three men of most eminent
righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job, who, he said, were the only men
that could be saved from a certain excessive wrath of God, which was
hanging over all the rest. <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303)  
A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one of three conspicuous
for righteousness, prays, and says, "While I was speaking, and praying,
and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting
my supplication before the Lord my God." <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304)   And you say that you are without
sin, because forsooth you are a priest; and if <span id="page_594">p.
594</span> <span id="v.v.iv.cvi-Page_594"></span>the people sin, you
pray for them:  but if you sin, who shall pray for you?  For clearly by
the impiety of such arrogance you show yourself to be unworthy of the
mediation of that Priest whom the prophet would have to be understood in
these words, which you do not understand.  For now that no one may ask
why this was said, I will explain it so far as by God’s grace I shall be
able.  God was preparing the minds of men, by His prophet, to desire a
Priest of such a sort that none should pray for Him.  He was Himself
prefigured in the times of the first people and the first temple, in
which all things were figures for our ensample.  Therefore the high
priest used to enter alone into the holy of holies, that he might make
supplication for the people, which did not enter with the priest into
that inner sanctuary; <span id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305) just as
our High Priest is entered into the secret places of the heavens, into
that truer holy of holies, whilst we for whom He prays are still placed
here. <span id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306)   It is with this
reference that the prophet says, "If the people shall sin, the priest
shall pray for them:  but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for
him?"  Seek therefore a priest of such a kind that he cannot sin, nor
need that one should pray for him.  And for this reason prayer is made
for the apostles by the people; <span
id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307) but for that Priest who is the
Master and Lord of the apostles is prayer not made.  Hear John
confessing this, and saying, "My little children, these things write I
unto you, that ye sin not.  And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with
the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for
our sins." <span id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308)   "*We* have," he
says; and "for *our* sins."  I pray you, learn humility, that you may
not fall, or rather, that in time you may arise again.  For had you not
already fallen, you never would have used such words.
