class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xciv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Where is the law of God? where is your Christianity, if you not only
commit murders and put men to death, but also order such things to be
done?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xciv-p2"></span>215.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xciv-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  In reply to
this, see what the fellow-heirs of Christ say throughout the world.  We
neither commit murders, and put men to death, nor order such things to
be done; and you are raging much more madly than those who do such
things, in that you put such things into the minds of men in opposition
to the hopes of everlasting life.
