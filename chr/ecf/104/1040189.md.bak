id="iv.x.vii-p1.1"></span> Chapter 5.—The Corrupted Nature of a More
Excellent Order Sometimes Better Than an Inferior Nature Even
Uncorrupted.</span>

<span id="iv.x.vii-p2"></span>But it may happen, that a certain nature
which has been ranked as more excellent by reason of natural measure and
form, though corrupt, is even yet better than another incorrupt which
has been ranked lower by reason of an inferior natural measure and
form:  as in the estimation of men, according to the quality which
presents itself to view, corrupt gold is assuredly better than incorrupt
silver, and corrupt silver than incorrupt lead; so also in more powerful
spiritual natures a rational spirit even corrupted through an evil will
is better than an irrational though incorrupt, and better is any spirit
whatever even corrupt than any body whatever though incorrupt.  For
better is a nature which, when it is present in a body, furnishes it
with life, than that to which life is furnished.  But however corrupt
may be the spirit of life that has been made, it can furnish life to a
body, and hence, though corrupt, it is better than the body though
incorrupt.
