<span id="iv.ix.v"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.v-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="iv.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Book III.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.v-p2"></span>Faustus objects to the incarnation of God
on the ground that the evangelists are at variance with each other, and
that incarnation is unsuitable to deity.  Augustin attempts to remove
the critical and theological difficulties.

<span id="iv.ix.v-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.v-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  Do I believe in the
incarnation?  For my part, this is the very thing I long tried to
persuade myself of, that God was born; but the discrepancy in the
genealogies of Luke and Matthew stumbled me, as I knew not which to
follow.  For I thought it might happen that, from not being omniscient,
I might take the true for false, and the false for true.  So, in despair
of settling this dispute, I betook myself to Mark and John, two
authorities still, and evangelists as much as the others.  I approved
with good reason of the beginning of Mark and John, for they have
nothing of David, or Mary, or Joseph.  John says, "In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," meaning
Christ.  Mark says, "The gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God," as if
correcting Matthew, who calls him the Son of David.  Perhaps, however,
the Jesus of Matthew is a different person from the Jesus of Mark.  This
is my reason for not believing in the birth of Christ.

<span id="iv.ix.v-p4"></span>Remove this difficulty, if you can, by
harmonizing the accounts, and I am ready to yield.  In any case,
however, it is hardly consistent to believe that God, the God of
Christians, was born from the womb.

<span id="iv.ix.v-p5"></span>2.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.v-p5.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  Had you read the
Gospel with care, and inquired into those places where you found
opposition, instead of rashly condemning them, you would have seen that
the recognition of the authority of the evangelists by so many learned
men all over the world, in spite of this most obvious discrepancy,
proves that there is more in it than appears at first sight.  Any one
can see, as well as you, that the ancestors of Christ in Matthew and
Luke are different; while Joseph appears in both, at the end in Matthew
and at the beginning in Luke.  Joseph, it is plain, might be called the
father of Christ, on account of his being in a certain sense the husband
of the mother of Christ; and so his name, as the male representative,
appears at the beginning or end of the genealogies.  Any one can see as
well as you that Joseph has one father in Matthew and another in Luke,
and so with the grandfather and with all the rest up to David.  Did all
the able and learned men, not many Latin writers certainly, but
innumerable Greek, who have examined most attentively the sacred
Scriptures, overlook this manifest difference?  Of course they saw it. 
No one can help seeing it.  But with a due regard to the high authority
of Scripture, they believed that there was something here which would be
given to those that ask, and denied to those that snarl; would be found
by those that seek, and taken away from those that criticise; would be
open to those that knock, and shut against those that contradict.  They
asked, sought, and knocked; they received, found, and entered in.

<span id="iv.ix.v-p6"></span>3.  The whole question is how Joseph had
two fathers.  Supposing this possible, both genealogies may be correct. 
With two fathers, why not two grandfathers, and two great-grandfathers,
and so on, up to David, who was the father both of Solomon, who is
mentioned in Matthew’s list, and of Nathan, who occurs in Luke?  This is
the difficulty with many people who think it impossible that two men
should have one and the same son, forgetting the very obvious fact that
a man may be called the son of the person who adopted him as well as of
the person who begot him.

<span id="iv.ix.v-p7"></span>Adoption, we know, was familiar to the
an<span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="iv.ix.v-Page_160"></span>cients; for even women adopted the children
of other women, as Sarah adopted Ishmael, and Leah her handmaid’s son,
and Pharaoh’s daughter Moses.  Jacob, too, adopted his grandsons, the
children of Joseph.  Moreover, the word adoption is of great importance
in the system of our faith, as is seen from the apostolic writings.  For
the Apostle Paul, speaking of the advantages of the Jews, says:  "Whose
are the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of
the law; whose are the fathers, and of whom, according to the flesh,
Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever." <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md)   And again:  "We ourselves also groan
within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, even the
redemption of the body." <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md)  
Again, elsewhere:  "But in the fullness of time, God sent His Son, made
of a woman, made under the law, that we might receive the adoption of
sons." <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md)   These passages show
clearly that adoption is a significant symbol.  God has an only Son,
whom He begot from His own substance, of whom it is said, "Being in the
form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal to God." <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md)   Us He begot not of His own
substance, for we belong to the creation which is not begotten, but
made; but that He might make us the brothers of Christ, He adopted us. 
That act, then, by which God, when we were not born of Him, but created
and formed, begot us by His word and grace, is called adoption.  So John
says, "He gave them power to become the sons of God." <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md)

<span id="iv.ix.v-p13"></span>Since, therefore; the practice of adoption
is common among our fathers, and in Scripture, is there not irrational
profanity in the hasty condemnation of the evangelists as false because
the genealogies are different, as if both could not be true, instead of
considering calmly the simple fact that frequently in human life one man
may have two fathers, one of whose flesh he is born, and another of
whose will he is afterwards made a son by adoption?  If the second is
not rightly called father, neither are we right in saying, "Our Father
which art in heaven," to Him of whose substance we were not born, but of
whose grace and most merciful will we were adopted, according to
apostolic doctrine, and truth most sure.  For one is to us God, and
Lord, and Father:  God, for by Him we are created, though of human
parents; Lord, for we are His subjects; Father, for by His adoption we
are born again.  Careful students of sacred Scripture easily saw, from a
little consideration, how, in the different genealogies of the two
evangelists, Joseph had two fathers, and consequently two lists of
ancestors.  You might have seen this too, if you had not been blinded by
the love of contradiction.  Other things far beyond your understanding
have been discovered in the careful investigation of all parts of these
narratives.  The familiar occurrence of one man begetting a son and
another adopting him, so that one man has two fathers, you might, in
spite of Manichæan error, have thought of as an explanation, if you had
not been reading in a hostile spirit.

<span id="iv.ix.v-p14"></span>4.  But why Matthew begins with Abraham
and descends to Joseph, while Luke begins with Joseph and ascends, not
to Abraham, but to God, who made man, and, by giving a commandment, gave
him power to become, by believing, a son of God; and why Matthew records
the generations at the commencement of his book, Luke after the baptism
of the Saviour by John; and what is the meaning of the number of the
generations in Matthew, who divides them into three sections of fourteen
each, though in the whole sum there appears to be one wanting; while in
Luke the number of generations recorded after the baptism amount to
seventy-seven, which number the Lord Himself enjoins in connection with
the forgiveness of sins, saying, "Not only seven times, but
seventy-seven times;"—these things you will never understand, unless
either you are taught by some Catholic of superior stamp, who has
studied the sacred Scriptures, and has made all the progress possible,
or you yourselves turn from your error, and in a Christian spirit ask
that you may receive, seek that you may find, and knock that it may be
opened to you.

<span id="iv.ix.v-p15"></span>5.  Since, then, this double fatherhood of
nature and adoption removes the difficulty arising from the discrepancy
of the genealogies, there is no occasion for Faustus to leave the two
evangelists and betake himself to the other two, which would be a
greater affront to those he betook himself to than to those he left. 
For the sacred writers do not desire to be favored at the expense of
their brethren.  For their joy is in union, and they are one in Christ;
and if one says one thing, and another another, or one in one way and
another in another, still they all speak truth, and in no way contradict
one another; only let the reader be reverent and humble, not in an
heretical spirit seeking occasion for strife, but with a believing heart
desiring edification.  Now, in this opinion that the evangelists give
the ancestors of different fathers, as it is quite possible for a man to
have two fathers, there is nothing inconsistent with truth.  So the
evangelists are harmonized, and you, by Faustus’s promise are bound to
yield at once.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span> <span id="iv.ix.v-Page_161"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.v-p16"></span>6.  You may perhaps be troubled by that
additional remark which he makes:  "In any case, however, it is hardly
consistent to believe that God, the God of Christians, was born from the
womb."  As if we believed that the divine nature came from the womb of a
woman.  Have I not just quoted the testimony of the apostle, speaking of
the Jews:  "Whose are the fathers, and of whom, according to the flesh,
Christ came, who is God over all, blessed for ever?"  Christ, therefore,
our Lord and Saviour, true Son of God in His divinity, and true son of
man according to the flesh, not as He is God over all was born of a
woman, but in that feeble nature which He took of us, that in it He
might die for us, and heal it in us:  not as in the form of God, in
which He thought it not robbery to be equal to God, was He born of a
woman, but in the form of a servant, in taking which He emptied
Himself.  He is therefore said to have emptied Himself because He took
the form of a servant, not because He lost the form of God.  For in the
unchangeable possession of that nature by which in the form of God He is
equal to the Father, He took our changeable nature, by which He might be
born of a virgin.  You, while you protest against putting the flesh of
Christ in a virgin’s womb, place the very divinity of God in the womb
not only of human beings, but of dogs and swine.  You refuse to believe
that the flesh of Christ was conceived in the Virgin’s womb, in which
God was not found nor even changed; while you assert that in all men and
beasts, in the seed of male and in the womb of female, in all
conceptions on land or in water, an actual part of God and the divine
nature is continually bound, and shut up, and contaminated, never to be
wholly set free. <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md)
