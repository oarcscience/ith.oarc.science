<span id="v.v.iv.lxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 74.—</span>163.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxxiv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But these things do not alarm us Christians; for of the evil deeds
which you are destined to commit we have before a warning given us by
the Lord Christ.  ‘Behold,’ He says, ‘I send you forth as sheep in the
midst of wolves.’ <span id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md)   You fill
up the measure of the madness of wolves, who either lay or are preparing
to lay snares against the Churches in precisely the same way in which
wolves, with their mouths wide open against the fold, even with
destructive eagerness, breathe forth panting anger from their jaws,
suffused with blood."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxiv-p3"></span>164.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxiv-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I should be
glad to utter the same sentiment against you, but not in the words which
you have used:  they are too inappropriate, or rather mad.  But what was
required was, that you should show that we were wolves and that you were
sheep, not by the emptiest of evil-speaking, but by some distinct
proofs.  For when I too have said, We are sheep, and you are wolves, do
you think that there is any difference caused by the fact that you
express the idea in swelling words?  But listen whilst I prove what I
assert.  For the Lord says in the gospel, as you know full well, whether
you please it or not, "My sheep hear my voice, and follow me." <span
id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md)   There are many sayings of the
Lord on different subjects; but supposing, for example, that any one
were in doubt whether the same Lord had risen in the body, and His words
were to be quoted where He says, "Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath
not flesh and bones, as ye see me have;"—if even after this he should be
unwilling to acquiesce in the belief that His body had risen from the
dead, surely such a man could not be reckoned among the sheep of the
Lord, because he would not hear His voice.  And so too now, when the
question between us is, Where is the Church? whilst we quote the words
that follow in the same passage of the gospel, where, after His
resurrection, He gave His body even to be handled by those who were in
doubt, in which He showed the future wide extent of the Church, saying,
"Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise
from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins
should be preached in His name throughout all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem;" <span id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md) whereas you will
not communicate with all nations, in whom these words have been
fulfilled, how are you the sheep of this Shepherd, whose words you not
only do not obey when you have heard them, but even fight against them? 
And so we show to you from this that you are not sheep.  But listen
further whence we show you that, on the contrary, you are wolves.  For
necessarily, when it is shown by His own words where the Church is to be
found, it is also clear where we must look for the fold of Christ. 
Whenever, therefore, any sheep separate themselves from this fold, which
is expressly pointed out and shown to us by the unmistakeable
declaration of the Lord,—and that, I will not say because of charges
falsely brought, but on account of charges brought, as no one can deny,
with great uncertainty against their fellow-men, and consequently slay
those sheep which they have torn and alienated from the life of unity
and Christian love—is it not evident that they are ravening wolves?  But
it will be said that these very men themselves praise and preach the
Lord Christ.  They are therefore those of whom He says <span
id="page_569">p. 569</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.lxxiv-Page_569"></span>Himself, "They come unto you in
sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  By their
fruits ye shall know them." <span id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md)  
The sheep’s clothing is seen in the praises of Christ; the fruits of
their wolfish nature in their slanderous teeth.
