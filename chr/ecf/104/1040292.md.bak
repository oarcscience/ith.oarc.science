<span id="v.iv.v.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—</span>19.  Nor is it material,
when we are considering the question of the genuineness and holiness of
the sacrament, "what the recipient of the sacrament believes, and with
what faith he is imbued."  It is of the very highest consequence as
regards the entrance into salvation, but is wholly immaterial as regards
the question of the sacrament.  For it is quite possible that a man may
be possessed of the genuine sacrament and a corrupted faith, as it is
possible that he may hold the words of the creed in their integrity, and
yet entertain an erroneous belief about the Trinity, or the
resurrection, or any other point.  For it is no slight matter, even
within the Catholic Church itself, to hold a faith entirely consistent
with the truth about even God Himself, to say nothing of any of His
creatures.  Is it then to be maintained, that if any one who has been
baptized within the Catholic Church itself should afterwards, in the
course of reading, or by listening to instruction, or by quiet argument,
find out, through God’s own revelation, that he had before believed
otherwise than he ought, it is requisite that he should therefore be
baptized afresh?  But what carnal and natural man is there who does not
stray through the vain conceits <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) of his own heart, and picture God’s
nature to himself to be such as he has imagined out of his carnal sense,
and differ from the true conception of God as far as vanity from truth? 
Most truly, indeed, speaks the apostle, filled with the light of truth: 
"The natural man," says he, "receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God." <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md)   And yet herein he was
speaking of men whom he himself shows to have been baptized.  For he
says to them, "Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the
name of Paul?" <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md)   These men
had therefore the sacrament of baptism; and yet, inasmuch as their
wisdom was of the flesh, what could they believe about God otherwise
than according to the perception of their flesh, according to which "the
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God?"  To such he
says:  "I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.  I have fed you with milk, and not
with meat:  for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now
are ye able.  For ye are yet carnal." <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291.md)   For such are carried about with
every wind of doctrine, of which kind he says, "That we be no more
children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
doctrine." <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md)   It is then true
that, if these men shall have advanced even to the spiritual age of the
inner man, and in the integrity of understanding shall have learned how
far different from the requirements of the truth has been the belief
which they have been led by the fallacious character of their conceits
to entertain of God, they are therefore to be baptized again?  For, on
this principle, it would be possible for a Catholic catechumen to light
upon the writings of some heretic, and, not having the knowledge
requisite for discerning truth from error, he might entertain some
belief contrary to the Catholic faith, yet not condemned by the words of
the creed, just as, under color of the same words, innumerable heretical
errors have sprung up.  Supposing, then, that the catechumen was under
the impression that he was studying the work of some great and learned
Catholic, and was baptized with that belief in the Catholic Church, and
by subsequent research should discover what he ought to believe, so
that, embracing the Catholic faith, he should reject his former error,
ought he, on confessing this, to be baptized again?  Or supposing that,
before learning and confessing this for himself, he should be found to
entertain such an opinion, and should be taught what he ought to reject
and what he should believe, and it were to become clear that he had held
<span id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span
id="v.iv.v.xiv-Page_442"></span>this false belief when he was baptized,
ought he therefore to be baptized again?  Why should we maintain the
contrary?  Because the sanctity of the sacrament, consecrated in the
words of the gospel, remains upon him in its integrity, just as he
received it from the hands of the minister, although he, being firmly
rooted in the vanity of his carnal mind entertained a belief other than
was right at the time when he was baptized.  Wherefore it is manifest
that it is possible that, with defective faith, the sacrament of baptism
may yet remain without defect in any man; and therefore all that is said
about the diversity of the several heretics is beside the question.  For
in each person that is to be corrected which is found to be amiss by the
man who undertakes his correction.  That is to be made whole which is
unsound; that is to be given which is wanting, and, above all, the peace
of Christian charity, without which the rest is profitless.  Yet, as the
rest is there, we must not administer it as though it were wanting, only
take care that its possession be to the profit, not the hurt of him who
has it, through the very bond of peace and excellence of charity.
