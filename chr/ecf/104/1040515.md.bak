said:  "But yet, if I may be allowed the comparison, it is certain that
the sun appears double to the insane, although it only be that a dark
blue cloud often meets it, and its discolored surface, being struck by
the brightness, while the rays of the sun are reflected from it, seems
to send forth as it were rays of its own.  So in the same way in the
faith of baptism, it is one thing to seek for reflections, another to
recognize the truth."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>65.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  What are you
saying, if I may ask?  When a dark blue cloud reflects the rays of the
sun with which it is struck, is it only to the insane, and not to all
who look on it, that there appear to be two suns?  But when it appears
so to the insane as such, it appears to them alone.  But if I may say so
without being troublesome, I would have you take care lest saying such
things and talking in such a way should be itself a sign of madness.  I
suppose, however, that what you meant to say was this,—that the just had
the truth of baptism, the unjust only its reflection.  And if this be
so, I venture to say that the reflection was found in that man of our
party, <span id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md) to whom not God, but a
certain Count, <span id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md) was God; but
that the truth was either in you or in him who uttered the witty saying
against Optatus, when he said that "in the Count he had a god for his
companion." <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md)   And distinguish
between those who were baptized by either of these, and in the one party
approve the true baptism, in the others exclude the reflection, and
introduce the truth.
