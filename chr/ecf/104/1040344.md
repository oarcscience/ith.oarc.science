<span id="v.iv.vii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—</span>25.  Wherefore, as
regards those who received the persons who came from heresy in the same
baptism of Christ with which they had been baptized outside the Church,
and said "that they followed ancient custom," as indeed the Church now
receives such, it is in vain urged against them "that among the ancients
there were as yet only the first beginning of heresy and schisms, <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) so that those were involved in them
who were seceders from the Church, and had originally been baptized
within the Church, so that it was not necessary that they should be
baptized again when they returned and did penance."  For so soon as each
several heresy existed, and departed from the communion of the Catholic
Church, it was possible that, I will not even say the next day, but even
on that very day, its votaries might have baptized some who flocked to
them.  And therefore if this was the old custom, that they should be so
received into the Church (as could not be denied even by those who
maintained the contrary part in the discussion), there can be no doubt
in the mind of any one who pays careful attention to the matter, that
those also were so received who had been baptized without in heresy.

<span id="v.iv.vii.xix-p3"></span>26.  But I cannot see what show of
reason there is in this, that the name of "erring sheep" <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) should be denied to one whose lot
it has been that, while seeking the salvation which is in Christ, he has
fallen into the error of heretics, and been baptized in their body;
while he is held to have become a sheep al<span id="page_473">p.
473</span> <span id="v.iv.vii.xix-Page_473"></span>ready within the body
of the Catholic Church herself, who has renounced the world in words and
not in deeds, and has received baptism in such falseness of heart as
this.  Or if such an one also does not become a sheep unless after
turning to God with a true heart, then, as he is not baptized at the
time when he becomes a sheep, if he had been already baptized, but was
not yet a sheep; so he too, who comes from the heretics that he may
become a sheep, is not then to be baptized if he had been already
baptized with the same baptism, though he was not yet a sheep. 
Wherefore, since even all the bad that are within—the covetous, the
envious, the drunkards, and those that live contrary to the discipline
of Christ—may be deservedly called liars, and in darkness, and dead, and
antichrists, do they yet therefore not baptize, on the ground that
"there can be nothing common between truth and falsehood, between light
and darkness, between death and immortality, between Antichrist and
Christ?" <span id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md)

<span id="v.iv.vii.xix-p6"></span>27.  He makes an assumption, then, not
"of mere custom," but "of the reason of truth itself," <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) when he says that the sacrament of
God cannot be turned to error by the error of any men, since it is
declared to exist even in those who have erred.  Assuredly the Apostle
John says most plainly, "He that hateth his brother is in darkness even
until now;" <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) and again,
"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer;" <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) and why, therefore, do they baptize
those within the Church whom Cyprian himself declares to be in the envy
of malice? <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md)
