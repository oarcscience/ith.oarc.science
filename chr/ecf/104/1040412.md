<span id="v.iv.ix.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—</span>24.  Venantius of
Tinisa <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md) said:  "If a husband,
going on a journey into foreign countries, had entrusted the
guardianship of his wife to a friend, he would surely keep her that was
entrusted to his care with the utmost diligence, that her chastity and
holiness might not be defiled by any one.  Christ our Lord and God, when
going to the Father, committed His bride to our care:  do we keep her
uncorrupt and undefiled, or do we betray her purity and chastity to
adulterers and corrupters?  For he who makes the baptism of Christ
common with heretics betrays the bride of Christ to adulterers." <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xiii-p4"></span>25.  We answer:  What of those who,
when they are baptized, turn themselves to the Lord with their lips and
not with their heart? do not they possess an adulterous mind?  Are not
they themselves lovers of the world, which they renounce in words and
not in deeds; and they corrupt good manners through evil communications,
saying, "Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die?" <span
id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md)   Did not the discourse of the
apostle take heed even against such as these, when he says, "But I fear,
lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so
your minds \[also\] should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
Christ?" <span id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md)   When, therefore,
Cyprian held the baptism of Christ to be in common with such men, did he
therefore betray the bride of Christ into the hands of adulterers, or
did he not rather recognize the necklace of the Bridegroom even on an
adulteress?
