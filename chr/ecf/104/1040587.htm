<p class="c41"><a name="v.v.iv.c-p1"></A> <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.c-p1.1"></A>Chapter 100.&#8212;</span>227.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.c-p1.2"></A>Petilianus</span> said:&#160; "But we who are poor in spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2268"></A><A HREF="#fn_2268"><FONT SIZE="1">2269</FONT></A>
 are not apprehensive for our wealth, but rather feel a dread of wealth.&#160; We, &#145;as having nothing, and yet possessing all things,&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2269"></A><A HREF="#fn_2269"><FONT SIZE="1">2270</FONT></A>
 look on our soul as our wealth, and by our punishments and blood purchase to ourselves the everlasting riches of heaven.&#160; So again the same Lord says, &#145;Whosoever shall lose his substance, shall find it again an hundred fold.&#146;"</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.v.iv.c-p4"></A>228.&#160; <span class="c11"><a name="v.v.iv.c-p4.1"></A>Augustin</span> answered:&#160; It is not beside the purpose to inquire into the true meaning of this passage also.&#160; For where my purpose is not interfered with by any mistake which you make, or any false impression which you convey in quoting from the Scriptures, I do not concern myself about the matter.&#160; It is not then written, "Whosoever shall lose his substance," but "Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake."   &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2270"></A><A HREF="#fn_2270"><FONT SIZE="1">2271</FONT></A>
&#160; And the passage about substance is not, "Whosoever shall lose," but "Every one that hath forsaken;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2271"></A><A HREF="#fn_2271"><FONT SIZE="1">2272</FONT></A>
 and that not only with reference to substance of money, but many other things besides.&#160; But you meanwhile have not lost your substance; but whether you have forsaken it, in that you so boast of poverty, I cannot say.&#160; And if by any chance my colleague Fortunatus may know this, being in the same city with you, he never told me, because I had never asked him.&#160; However, even if you had done this, you have yet yourself quoted the testimony of the apostle against yourself in   this very epistle which you have written:&#160; "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2272"></A><A HREF="#fn_2272"><FONT SIZE="1">2273</FONT></A>
&#160; For if you had charity, you would not bring charges against the whole world, which knows nothing of you, and of which you know no more,&#8212;no, not even such charges as are founded on the proved offenses of the Africans.&#160; If you had charity, you would not picture to yourself a false unity in your calumnies, but you would learn to recognize the unity that is most clearly set forth in the words of the Lord:&#160; "even in the whole earth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2273"></A><A HREF="#fn_2273"><FONT SIZE="1">2274</FONT></A>
&#160; But if you did not do this, why do you boast as though you had done it?&#160; Are you really so filled with fear of riches, that, having nothing, you possess all things?&#160; Tell that to your colleague Crispinus, who lately bought a farm near our city of Hippo, that he might there plunge men into the lowest abyss.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2274"></A><A HREF="#fn_2274"><FONT SIZE="1">2275</FONT></A>
&#160; Whence I too know this all too well.&#160; You perhaps are not aware of it, and therefore shout out in security, "We stand in fear of riches."&#160; And hence I am surprised that that cry of yours has been allowed to pass Crispinus, so as to reach us.&#160; For between Constantina, where you are, and Hippo, where I am, lies Calama, where he is, nearer indeed to our side, but still between us.&#160; I wonder, therefore, how it was that he did not first intercept this cry, and strike it back   so that it should not reach to our ears; and that he did not, in opposition to you, recite in much more copious phrase a eulogy on riches.&#160; For he not only stands in no fear of riches, but he actually loves them.&#160; And certainly, before you utter anything about the rest, you should rehearse such views to him.&#160; If he makes no corrections, then we have our answer ready.&#160; But for yourself, if it be true that you are poor, you have with you my brother Fortunatus.&#160; You will be more likely with such   sentiments to please him, who is my colleague, than Crispinus, who is your own.</p>
