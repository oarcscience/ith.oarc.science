<span id="v.iv.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—</span>17.  What answer they
can give about the followers of Maximianus whom they have received, they
cannot divine.  If they say, "Those we received were innocent," the
answer is obvious, "Then you had condemned the innocent."  If they say,
"We did it in ignorance," then you judged rashly (just as you passed a
rash judgment on the traditors), and your declaration was false that
"you must know that they were condemned by the truthful voice of a
plenary Council." <span id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256)   For
indeed the innocent could never be condemned by a voice of truth.  If
they say, "We did not condemn them," it is only necessary to cite the
Council, to cite the names of bishops and states alike.  If they say,
"The Council itself is none of ours," then we cite the records of the
proconsular province, where more than once they quoted the same Council
to justify the exclusion of the followers of Maximianus from the
basilicas, and to confound them by the din of the judges and the force
of their allies.  If they say that Felicianus of Musti, and Prætextatus
of Assavæ, whom they afterwards received, were not of the party of
Maximianus, then we cite the records in which they demanded, in the
courts of law, that these persons should be excluded from the Council
which they held against the party of Maximianus.  If they say, "They
were received for the sake of peace," our answer is, "Why then do ye not
acknowledge the only true and full peace?  Who urged you, who compelled
you to receive a schismatic whom you had condemned, to preserve the
peace of Donatus, and to condemn the world unheard, in violation of the
peace of Christ?"  Truth hems them in on every side.  They see that
there is no answer left for them to make, and they think that there is
nothing left for them to do; they cannot find out what to say.  They are
not allowed to be silent.  They had rather strive with perverse
utterance against truth, than be restored to peace by a confession of
their faults.
