<span id="v.iv.vi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—</span>23.  To go on to the
point which he pursues at great length, that "they who blaspheme the
Father of Christ cannot be baptized in Christ," <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434) since it is clear that they
blaspheme through error (for he who comes to the baptism of Christ will
not openly blaspheme the Father of Christ, but he is led to blaspheme by
holding a view contrary to the teaching of the truth about the Father of
Christ), we have already shown at sufficient length that baptism,
consecrated in the words of the gospel, is not affected by the error of
<span id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xv-Page_457"></span>any man, whether ministrant or
recipient, whether he hold views contrary to the revelation of divine
teaching on the subject of the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghost. 
For many carnal and natural men are baptized even within the Church, as
the apostle expressly says:  "The natural man receiveth not the things
of the Spirit of God;" <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435) and
after they had received baptism, he says that they "are yet
carnal." <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436)   But according to
it carnal sense, a soul given up to fleshly appetites cannot entertain
but fleshly wisdom about God.  Wherefore many, progressing after
baptism, and especially those who have been baptized in infancy or early
youth, in proportion as their intellect becomes clearer and brighter,
while "the inward man is renewed day by day," <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437) throw away their former opinions
which they held about God while they were mocked with vain imaginings,
with scorn and horror and confession of their mistake.  And yet they are
not therefore considered not to have received baptism, or to have
received baptism of a kind corresponding to their error; but in them
both the perfection of the sacrament is honored and the delusion of
their mind is corrected, even though it had become inveterate through
long confirmation, or been, perhaps, maintained in many controversies. 
Wherefore even the heretic, who is manifestly without, if he has there
received baptism as ordained in the gospel, has certainly not received
baptism of a kind corresponding to the error which blinds him.  And
therefore, in returning into the way of wisdom he perceives that he
ought to relinquish what he has held amiss, he must not at the same time
give up the good which he had received; nor because his error is to be
condemned, is the baptism of Christ in him to be therefore
extinguished.  For it is already sufficiently clear, from the case of
those who happen to be baptized within the Church with false views about
God, that the truth of the sacrament is to be distinguished from the
error of him who believes amiss, although both may be found in the same
man.  And therefore, when any one grounded in any error, even outside
the Church, has yet been baptized with the true sacrament, when he is
restored to the unity of the Church, a true baptism cannot take the
place of a true baptism, as a true faith takes the place of a false one,
because a thing cannot take the place of itself, since neither can it
give place.  Heretics therefore join the Catholic Church to this end,
that what they have evil of themselves may be corrected, not that what
they have good of God should be repeated.
