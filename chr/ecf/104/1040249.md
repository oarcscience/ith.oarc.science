<span id="v.iv.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—</span>9.  For, in the next
place, that I may not seem to rest on mere human arguments,—since there
is so much obscurity in this question, that in earlier ages of the
Church, before the schism of Donatus, it has caused men of great weight,
and even our fathers, the bishops, whose hearts were full of charity, so
to dispute and doubt among themselves, saving always the peace of the
Church, that the several statutes of their Councils in their different
districts long varied from each other, till at length the most wholesome
opinion was established, to the removal of all doubts, by a plenary
Council of the whole world: <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md)
—I therefore bring forward from the gospel clear proofs, by which I
propose, with God’s help, to prove how rightly and truly in the sight of
God it has been determined, that in the case of every schismatic and
heretic, the wound which caused his separation should be cured by the
medicine of the Church; but that what remained sound in him should
rather be recognized with approbation, than wounded by condemnation.  It
is indeed true that the Lord says in the gospel, "He that is not with me
is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad." <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159.md)   Yet when the
disciples had brought word to Him that they had seen one casting out
devils in His name, and had forbidden him, because he followed not them,
He said, "Forbid him not:  for he that is not against us is for us.  For
there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly
speak evil of me." <span id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md)   If,
indeed, there were nothing in this man requiring correction, then any
one would be safe who, setting himself outside the communion of the
Church, severing himself from all Christian brotherhood, should gather
in Christ’s name; and so there would be no truth in this, "He that is
not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad."  But if he required correction in the point where the disciples
in their ignorance were anxious to check him, why did our Lord, by
saying, "Forbid him not," prevent this check from being given?  And how
can that be true which He then says, "He that is not against you is for
you?"  For in this point he was not against, but for them, when he was
working miracles of healing in Christ’s name.  That both, therefore,
should be true, as both are true,—both the declaration, that "he that is
not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad;" and also the injunction, "Forbid him not; for he that is not
against you is for you,"—what must we understand, except that the man
was to be confirmed in his veneration for that mighty Name, in respect
of which he was not against the Church, but for it; and yet he was to be
blamed for separating himself from the Church, whereby his gathering
became a scattering; and if it should have so happened that he sought
union with the Church, he should not have received what he already
possessed, but be made to set right the points wherein he had gone
astray?
