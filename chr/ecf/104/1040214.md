<span id="iv.x.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—That Good Things, Even the
Least, and Those that are Earthly, are by God.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxxii-p2"></span>But that God made even the least things,
that is, earthly and mortal things, must undoubtedly be understood from
that passage of the apostle, where, speaking of the members of our
flesh:  "For if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with
it, and if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it;" also
this he then says:  "God has placed the members each one of them in the
body as he willed;" and "God has tempered the body, giving to that to
which it was wanting greater honor, that there should be no schism in
the body, but that the members should have the same care one for
another." <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110)   But what the
apostle thus praises in the measure and form and order of the members of
the flesh, you find in the flesh of all animals, alike the greatest and
the least; for all flesh is among earthly goods, and consequently is
esteemed among the least.
