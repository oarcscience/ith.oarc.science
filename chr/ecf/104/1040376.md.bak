<span id="v.iv.viii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—</span>38.  Dativus of
Badiæ <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) said "We, so far as
lies within our power, refuse to communicate with a heretic, unless he
has been baptized in the Church, and received remission of his
sins." <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxii-p4"></span>39.  The answer to this is:  If your
reason for wishing him to be baptized is that he has not received
remission of sins, supposing you find a man within the Church who has
been baptized, though entertaining hatred towards his brother, since the
Lord cannot lie, who says, "If ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses," <span
id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md) will you bid such an one, when
corrected, to be baptized afresh?  Assuredly not; so neither should you
bid the heretic.  It is clear that we must not pass unnoticed why he did
not briefly say, "We do not communicate with a heretic," but added, "so
far as lies within our power."  For he saw that a greater number agreed
with this view, from whose communion, however, he and his friends could
not separate themselves, lest unity should be impaired, and so he added,
"so far as lies within our power,"—showing beyond all doubt that he did
not willingly communicate with those whom he held to be without baptism,
but that yet all things were to be endured for the sake of peace and
unity; just as was done also by those who thought that Dativus and his
party were in the wrong, and who held what afterwards was taught by a
fuller declaration of the truth, and urged by ancient custom, which
received the stronger confirmation of a later Council; yet in turn, with
anxious piety, they showed toleration towards each other, though without
violation of Christian charity they entertained different opinions,
endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md) till God should reveal to one of
them, were he otherwise minded, even this error of his ways. <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665.md)   And to this I would have those
give heed, by whom unity is attacked on the authority of this very
Council by which it is declared how much unity should be loved.
