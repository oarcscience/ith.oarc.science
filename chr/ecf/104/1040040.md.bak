<span id="iv.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Description of the Duties of
Temperance, According to the Sacred Scriptures.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxi-p2"></span>35.  It is now time to return to the four
virtues, and to draw out and prescribe a way of life in conformity with
them, taking each separately.  First, then, let us consider temperance,
which promises us a kind of integrity and incorruption in the love by
which we are united to God.  The office of temperance is in restraining
and quieting the passions which make us pant for those things which turn
us away from the laws of God and from the enjoyment of His goodness,
that is, in a word, from the happy life.  For there is the abode of
truth; and in enjoying its contemplation, and in cleaving closely to it,
we are assuredly happy; but departing from this, men become entangled in
great errors and sorrows.  For, as the apostle says, "The root of all
evils is covetousness; which some having followed, have made shipwreck
of the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many
sorrows." <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md)   And this sin of the
soul is quite plainly, to those rightly understanding, set forth in the
Old Testament in the transgression of Adam in Paradise.  Thus, as the
apostle says, "In Adam we all die, and in Christ we shall all rise
again." <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)   Oh, the depth of these
mysteries!  But I refrain; for I am now engaged not in teaching you the
truth, but in making you unlearn your errors, if I can, that is, if God
aid my purpose regarding you.

<span id="iv.iv.xxi-p5"></span>36.  Paul then says that covetousness is
the root of all evils; and by covetousness the old law also intimates
that the first man fell.  Paul tells us to put off the old man and put
on the new. <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)   By the old man he
means Adam who sinned, and by the new man him whom the Son of God took
to Himself in consecration for our redemption.  For he says in another
place, "The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is from
heaven, heavenly.  As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy;
and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  And as we
have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the
heavenly,"  <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) —that is, put off the
old man, and put on the new.  The whole duty of temperance, then, is to
put off the old man, and to be renewed in God,—that is, to scorn all
bodily delights, and the popular applause, and to turn the whole love to
things divine and unseen.  Hence that following passage which is so
admirable:  "Though our outward man perish, <span id="page_52">p.
52</span> <span id="iv.iv.xxi-Page_52"></span>our inward man is renewed
day by day." <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md)   Hear, too, the
prophet singing, "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right
spirit within me." <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md)   What can be
said against such harmony except by blind barkers?
