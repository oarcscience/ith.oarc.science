<span id="v.v.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—</span>7.  Furthermore, whether
concerning Christ, or concerning His Church, or any other matter
whatsoever which is connected with your faith and life, to say nothing
of ourselves, who are by no means to be compared with him who said,
"Though we," at any rate, as he went on to say, "Though an angel from
heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which" ye have
received in the lawful and evangelical Scripture, "let him be
accursed." <span id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347)   While carrying
out this principle of action in our dealings with you, and with all whom
we desire to gain in Christ, and, amongst other things, while preaching
the holy Church which we read of as promised in the epistles of God, and
see to be fulfilled according to the promises in all nations of the
world, we have earned, not the rendering of <span id="page_600">p.
600</span> <span id="v.v.v.vi-Page_600"></span>thanks, but the flames of
hatred, from those whom we desire to have attracted into His most
peaceful bosom; as though we had bound them fast in that party for which
they cannot find any defense that they should make; or as though we so
long before had given injunctions to prophets and apostles that they
should insert in their books no proofs by which it might be shown that
the party of Donatus was the Church of Christ.  And we indeed, dear
brethren, when we hear false charges brought against us by those whom we
have offended by preaching the eloquence of truth, and confuting the
vanity of error, have, as you know, the most abundant consolation.  For
if, in the matters which they lay to my charge, the testimony of my
conscience does not stand against me in the sight of God, where no
mortal eye can reach, not only ought I not to be cast down, but I should
even rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is my reward in
heaven. <span id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348)   For in fact I ought
to consider, not how bitter, but how false is what I hear, and how true
He is in defense of whose name I am exposed to it, and to whom it is
said, "Thy name is as ointment poured forth." <span
id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349)   And deservedly does it smell
sweet in all nations, though those who speak evil of us endeavor to
confine its fragrance within one corner of Africa.  Why therefore should
we take amiss that we are reviled by men who thus detract from the glory
of Christ, whose party and schism find offense in what was foretold so
long before of His ascent into the heavens, and of the pouring forth of
His name, as of the savor of ointment:  "Be Thou exalted, O God, above
the heavens:  let Thy glory be above all the earth"? <span
id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350)
