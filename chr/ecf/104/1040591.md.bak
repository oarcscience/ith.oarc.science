<span id="v.v.iv.civ"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.civ-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.civ-p1.1"></span>Chapter 104.—</span>236.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.civ-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"David also said, ‘The oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head.’  Who
is it, therefore, that he calls a sinner?  Is it I who suffer your
violence, or you who persecute the innocent?"

<span id="v.v.iv.civ-p2"></span>237.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.civ-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  As representing
the body of Christ, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar
and mainstay of the truth, dispersed throughout the world, on account of
the gospel which was preached, according to the words of the apostle,
"to every creature which is under heaven:" <span
id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md)   as representing the whole world,
of which David, whose words you cannot understand, has said, "The world
also is stablished, that it cannot be moved;" <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) whereas you contend that it not
only has been moved, but has been utterly destroyed:  as representing
this, I answer, I do not persecute the innocent.  But David said, "The
oil of the sinner," not of the *traditor*; not of him who offers
incense, not of the persecutor, but "of the sinner."  What then will you
make of your interpretation?  See first whether you are not yourself a
sinner.  It is nothing to the point if you should say, I am not a
*traditor*, I am not an offerer of incense, I am not a persecutor.  I
myself, by the grace of God, am none of these, nor is the world, which
cannot be moved.  But say, if you dare, I am not a sinner.  For David
says, "The oil of the sinner."  For so long as any sin, however light,
be found in you, what ground have you for maintaining that you are not
concerned in the expression that is used, "The oil of the sinner"?  For
I would ask whether you use the Lord’s prayer in your devotions?  For if
you do not use that prayer, which our Lord taught His disciples for
their use, where have you learned another, proportioned to your merits,
as exceeding the merits of the apostles?  But if you pray, as our great
Master deigned to teach us, how do you say, "Forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive them that trespass against us?"  For in this petition we
are not referring to those sins which have already been forgiven us in
baptism.  Therefore these words in the prayer either exclude you from
being a petitioner to God, or else they make it manifest that you too
are a sinner.  Let those then come and kiss your head who have been
baptized by you, whose heads have perished through your oil.  But see to
yourself, both what you are and what you think about yourself.  Is it
really true that Optatus, whom pagans, Jews, Christians, men of our
party, men of your party, all proclaim throughout the whole of Africa to
have been a thief, a traitor, an oppressor, a contriver of schism; not a
friend, not a client, but a tool of him <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) whom one of your party declared to
have been his count, companion, and god,—is it true that he was not a
sinner in any conceivable interpretation of the term?  What then will
they do whose heads were anointed by one guilty of a capital offense? 
Do not those very men kiss your heads, on whose heads you pass so
serious a judgment by this interpretation which you place upon the
passage?  Truly I would bid you bring them forth, and admonish them to
heal themselves.  Or is it rather your heads which should be healed, who
run so grievously astray?  What then, you will ask, did David really
say:  Why do you ask me:  rather ask himself.  He answers you in the
verse above:  "The righteous shall smite me in kindness, and shall
reprove me; but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head." <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md)   What could be plainer? what more
manifest?  I had rather, he says, be healed by a rebuke administered in
kindness, than be deceived and led astray by smooth flattery, coming on
me as an ointment on my head.  The self-same sentiment is found
elsewhere in Scripture under other words:  "Better are the wounds of a
friend than the proffered kisses of an enemy." <span
