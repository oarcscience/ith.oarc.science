id="v.iv.viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—</span>6.  And so it is clear
that no good ground is shown herein why the bad man, who has baptism,
may not also confer it; and as he has it to destruction, so he may also
confer it to destruction,—not because this is the character of the thing
conferred, nor of the person conferring, but because it is the character
of him on whom it is conferred.  For when a bad man confers it on a good
man, that is, on one in the bond of unity, converted with a true
conversion, the wickedness of him who confers it makes no severance
between the good sacrament which is conferred, and the good member of
the Church on whom it is conferred.  And when his sins are forgiven him
on his true conversion to God, they are forgiven by those to whom he is
united by his true conversion.  For the same Spirit forgives them, which
is given to all the saints that cling to one another in love, whether
they know one another in the body or not.  Similarly when a man’s sins
are retained, they are assuredly retained by those from whom he, in whom
they are retained, separates himself by dissimilarity of life, and by
the turning away of a corrupt heart, whether they know him in the body
or not.
