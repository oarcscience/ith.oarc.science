<p class="c38"><a name="iv.viii.viii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.viii.viii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 7.&#8212;In What Sense the Followers of Manich&aelig;us Believe Him to Be the Holy Spirit.</span></p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.viii-p2"></A>8.&#160; Besides, you should explain how it is that, while the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are united in equality of nature, as you also acknowledge, you are not ashamed to speak of Manich&aelig;us, a man taken into union with the Holy Spirit, as born of ordinary generation; and yet you shrink from believing that the man taken into union with the only-begotten Wisdom of God was born of a Virgin.&#160; If human flesh, if generation [<i>concubitus viri</i>], if the womb of a woman could not contaminate the Holy Spirit, how could the Virgin&#146;s womb contaminate the Wisdom of God?&#160; This Manich&aelig;us, then, who boasts of a connection with the Holy Spirit, and of being spoken of in the gospel, must produce his claim to either of these two things,&#8212;that he was sent by the Spirit, or that he was taken into union with the Spirit.&#160; If he was sent, let him call himself the apostle of the Paraclete; if taken into union, let him allow that He whom the only-begotten Son took upon Himself had a human mother, since he admits a human father as well as mother in the case of one taken up by the Holy Spirit.&#160; Let him believe that the Word of God was not defiled by the virgin womb of Mary, since he exhorts us to believe that the Holy Spirit could not be defiled by the married life of his parents.&#160; But if you say that Manich&aelig;us was united to the Spirit, not in the womb or before conception, but after his birth, still you must admit that he had a fleshly nature derived from man and woman.&#160; And since you are not afraid to speak of the blood and the bodily substance of Manich&aelig;us as coming from ordinary generation, or of the internal impurities contained in his flesh, and hold that the Holy Spirit, who took on Himself, as you believe, this human being, was not contaminated by all those things, why should I shrink from speaking of the Virgin&#146;s womb and body undefiled, and not rather believe that the Wisdom of God in union with the human being in his mother&#146;s flesh still remained free from stain and pollution?&#160; Wherefore, as, whether your Manich&aelig;us professes to be sent by or to be united with the Paraclete, neither statement can hold good, I am on my guard, and refuse to believe either in his mission or in his susception.</p>
