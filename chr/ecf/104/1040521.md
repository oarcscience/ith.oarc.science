class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxxiv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"For if the apostles were allowed to baptize those whom John had washed
with the baptism of repentance, shall it not likewise be allowed to me
to baptize men guilty of sacrilege like yourselves?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxiv-p2"></span>80.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Where then is
what you said above, that there was not one baptism of John and another
of Christ, but that there was one baptism, consecrated in three stages,
of which three stages John gave the water, Christ the Spirit, and the
Comforter the fire?  Why then did the apostles repeat the water in the
case of those to whom John had already administered water belonging to
the one baptism which is consecrated in three stages?  Surely you must
see how necessary it is that every one should understand the meaning of
what he is discussing.
