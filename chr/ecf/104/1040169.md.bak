<span id="iv.ix.xxiii"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Book XXI.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p2"></span>Faustus denies that Manichæans believe
in two gods.  Hyle no god.  Augustin discusses at large the doctrine of
God and Hyle, and fixes the charge of dualism upon the Manichæans.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  Do we believe in one
God or in two?  In one, of course.  If we are accused of making two
gods, I reply that it cannot be shown that we ever said anything of the
kind.  Why do you suspect us of this?  Because, you say, you believe in
two principles, good and evil.  It is true, we believe in two
principles; but one we call God, and the other *Hyle*, or, to use common
popular language, the devil.  If you think this means two gods, you may
as well think that the health and sickness of which doctors speak are
two kinds of health, or that good and evil are two kinds of good, or
that wealth and poverty are two kinds of wealth.  If I were describing
two things, one white and the other black, or one hot and the other
cold, or one sweet and the other bitter, it would appear like idiocy or
insanity in you to say that I was describing two white things, or two
hot things, or two sweet things.  So, when I assert that there are two
principles, God and *Hyle*, you have no reason for saying that I believe
in two gods.  Do you think that we must call them both gods because we
attribute, as is proper, all the power of evil to *Hyle*, and all the
power of good to God?  If so, you may as well say that a poison and the
antidote must both be called antidotes, because each has a power of its
own, and certain effects follow from the action of both.  So also, you
may say that a physician and a poisoner are both physicians; or that a
just and an unjust man are both just, because both do something.  If
this is absurd, it is still more absurd to say that God and *Hyle* must
both be gods, because they both produce certain effects.  It is a very
childish and impotent way of arguing, when you cannot refute my
statements, to make a quarrel about names.  I grant that we, too,
sometimes call the hostile nature God; not that we believe it to be God,
but that this name is already adopted by the worshippers of this nature,
who in their error suppose it to be God.  Thus the apostle says:  "The
god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not." <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md)   He calls him God, because he would
be so called by his worshippers; adding that he blinds their minds, to
show that he is not the true God.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p5"></span>2.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-p5.1"></span>Augustin</span> replied:  You often speak
in your discourses of two gods, as indeed you acknowledge, though at
first you denied it.  And you give as a reason for thus speaking the
words of the apostle:  "The god of this world has blinded the minds of
them that believe not."  Most of us punctuate this sentence differently,
and explain it as meaning <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-Page_265"></span>that the true God has blinded the minds
of unbelievers.  They put a stop after the word God, and read the
following words together.  Or without this punctuation you may, for the
sake of exposition, change the order of the words, and read, "In whom
God has blinded the minds of unbelievers of this world," which gives the
same sense.  The act of blinding the minds of unbelievers may in one
sense be ascribed to God, as the effect not of malice, but of justice. 
Thus Paul himself says elsewhere, "Is God unjust, who taketh vengeance?"
 <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) and again, "What shall we say
then?  Is there unrighteousness with God?  God forbid.  For Moses saith,
I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will have compassion on
whom I will have compassion."  Observe what he adds, after asserting the
undeniable truth that there is no unrighteousness with God:  "But what
if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make His power known, endured
with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,
and that He might manifest the riches of His grace towards the vessels
of mercy, which He hath before prepared unto glory?" <span
id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) etc.  Here it evidently cannot be said
that it is one God who shows his wrath, and makes known his power in the
vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, and another God who shows his
riches in the vessels of mercy.  According to the apostle’s doctrine, it
is one and the same God who does both.  Hence he says again, "For this
cause God gave them up to the lusts of their own heart, to uncleanness,
to dishonor their own bodies between themselves;" and immediately after,
"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections;" and again, "And
even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave
them over to a reprobate mind." <span id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md)
  Here we see how the true and just God blinds the minds of
unbelievers.  For in all these words quoted from the apostle no other
God is understood than He whose Son, sent by Him, came saying, "For
judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not might see,
and that they which see might be made blind." <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md)   Here, again, it is plain to the
minds of believers how God blinds the minds of unbelievers.  For among
the secret things, which contain the righteous principles of God’s
judgment, there is a secret which determines that the minds of some
shall be blinded, and the minds of some enlightened.  Regarding this, it
is well said of God, "Thy judgments are a great deep." <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md)   The apostle, in admiration of the
unfathomable depth of this abyss, exclaims:  "O the depth of the riches
both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!  How unsearchable are
His judgments, and His ways past finding out!" <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md)

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p12"></span>3.  You cannot distinguish between
what God does in mercy and what He does in judgment, because you can
neither understand nor use the words of our Psalter:  "I will sing of
mercy and judgment unto Thee, O Lord." <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md)   Accordingly, whatever in the
feebleness of your frail humanity seems amiss to you, you separate
entirely from the will and judgment of God:  for you are provided with
another evil god, not by a discovery of truth, but by an invention of
folly; and to this god you attribute not only what you do unjustly, but
also what you suffer justly.  Thus you assign to God the bestowal of
blessings, and take from Him the infliction of judgments, as if He of
whom Christ says that He has prepared everlasting fire for the wicked
were a different being from Him who makes His sun to rise upon the evil
and the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.  Why do you
not understand that this great goodness and great severity belong to one
God, but because you have not learned to sing of mercy and judgment?  Is
not He who causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends
rain on the just and on the unjust, the same who also breaks off the
natural branches, and engrafts contrary to nature the wild olive tree? 
Does not the apostle, in reference to this, say of this one God:  "Thou
seest, then, the goodness and severity of God:  to them which were
broken off, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His
goodness?" <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md)   Here it is to be
observed how the apostle takes away neither judicial severity from God,
nor free-will from man.  It is a profound mystery, impenetrable by human
thought, how God both condemns the ungodly and justifies the ungodly;
for both these things are said of Him in the truth of the Holy
Scriptures.  But is the mysteriousness of the divine judgments any
reason for taking pleasure in cavilling against them?  How much more
becoming, and more suitable to the limitation of our powers, to feel the
same awe which the apostle felt, and to exclaim, "O the depth of the
riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!  How unsearchable
are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!"  How much better thus
to admire what you cannot explain, than to try to make an evil god in
addition to the true God, simply because you cannot under<span
id="page_266">p. 266</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxiii-Page_266"></span>stand
the one good God!  For it is not a question of names, but of actions.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p15"></span>4.  Faustus glibly defends himself by
saying, "We speak not of two gods, but of God and *Hyle*."  But when you
ask for the meaning of *Hyle*, you find that it is in fact another god. 
If the Manichæans gave the name of *Hyle*, as the ancients did, to the
unformed matter which is susceptible of bodily forms, we should not
accuse them of making two gods.  But it is pure folly and madness to
give to matter the power of forming bodies, or to deny that what has
this power is God.  When you give to some other being the power which
belongs to the true God of making the qualities and forms, by which
bodies, elements, and animals exist, according to their respective
modes, whatever name you choose to give to this being, you are
chargeable with making another god.  There are indeed two errors in this
blasphemous doctrine.  In the first place, you ascribe the act of God to
a being whom you are ashamed to call god; though you must call him god
as long as you make him do things which only God can do.  In the second
place, the good things done by a good God you call bad, and ascribe to
an evil god, because you feel a childish horror of whatever shocks the
frailty of fallen humanity, and a childish pleasure in the opposite.  So
you think snakes are made by an evil being; while you consider the sun
so great a good, that you believe it to be not the creature of God, but
an emission from His substance.  You must know that the true God, in
whom, alas, you have not yet come to believe, made both the snake along
with the lower creatures, and the sun along with other exalted
creatures.  Moreover, among still more exalted creatures, not heavenly
bodies, but spiritual beings, He has made what far surpasses the light
of the sun, and what no carnal man can perceive, much less you, who, in
your condemnation of flesh, condemn the very principle by which you
determine good and evil.  For your only idea of evil is from the
disagreeableness of some things to the fleshly sense; and your only idea
of good is from sensual gratification.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p16"></span>5.  When I consider the things lowest
in the scale of nature, which are within our view, and which, though
earthly, and feeble, and mortal, are still the works of God, I am lost
in admiration of the Creator, who is so great, in the great works and no
less great in the small.  For the divine skill seen in the formation of
all creatures in heaven and earth is always like itself, even in those
things that differ from one another; for it is everywhere perfect, in
the perfection which it gives to everything in its own kind.  We see
each creature made not as a whole by itself, but in relation to the rest
of the creation; so that the whole divine skill is displayed in the
formation of each, arranging each in its proper place and order, and
providing what is suitable for all, both separately and unitedly.  See
here, lowest in the scale, the animals which fly, and swim, and walk,
and creep.  These are mortal creatures, whose life, as it is written,
"is as a vapor which appeareth for a little time." <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md)   Each of these, according to the
capacity of its kind, contributes the measure appointed in the goodness
of the Creator to the completeness of the whole, so that the lowest
partake in the good which the highest possess in a greater degree.  Show
me, if you can, any animal, however despicable, whose soul hates its own
flesh, and does not rather nourish and cherish it, by its vital motion
minister to its growth and direct its activity, and exercise a sort of
management over a little universe of its own, which it makes subservient
to its own preservation.  Even in the discipline of his own body by a
rational being, who brings his body under, that earthly passion may not
hinder his perception of wisdom, there is love for his own flesh, which
he then reduces to obedience, which is its proper condition.  Indeed,
you yourselves, although your heresy teaches you a fleshly abhorrence of
the flesh, cannot help loving your own flesh, and caring for its safety
and comfort, both by avoiding all injury from blows, and falls, and
inclement weather, and by seeking for the means of keeping it in
health.  Thus the law of nature is too strong for your false doctrine.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p18"></span>6.  Looking at the flesh itself, do we
not see in the construction of its vital parts, in the symmetry of form,
in the position and arrangement of the limbs of action and the organs of
sensation, all acting in harmony; do we not see in the adjustment of
measures, in the proportion of numbers, in the order of weights, the
handiwork of the true God, of whom it is truly said, "Thou hast ordered
all things in measure, and number, and weight"?  <span
id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md)   If your heart was not hardened and
corrupted by falsehood, you would understand the invisible things of God
from the things which He has made, even in these feeble creatures of
flesh.  For who is the author of the things I have mentioned, but He
whose unity is the standard of all measure, whose wisdom is the model of
all beauty, and whose law is the rule of all order?  If you are blind to
these things, hear at least the words of the apostle.

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-Page_267"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p20"></span>7.  For the apostle, in speaking of
the love which husbands ought to have for their wives gives, as an
example, the love of the soul for the body.  The words are:  "He that
loveth his wife, loveth himself:  for no man ever yet hated his own
flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ the
Church." <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md)   Look at the whole
animal creation, and you find in the instinctive self-preservation of
every animal this natural principle of love to its own flesh.  It is so
not only with men, who, when they live aright, both provide for the
safety of their flesh, and keep their carnal appetites in subjection to
the use of reason; the brutes also avoid pain, and shrink from death,
and escape as rapidly as they can from whatever might break up the
construction of their bodies, or dissolve the connection of spirit and
flesh; for the brutes, too, nourish and cherish their own flesh.  "For
no one ever yet," says the apostle, "hated his own flesh, but nourisheth
and cherisheth it, even as Christ the Church."  See where the apostle
begins, and to what he ascends.  Consider, if you can, the greatness
which creation derives from its Creator, embracing as it does the whole
extent from the host of heaven down to flesh and blood, with the beauty
of manifold form, and the order of successive gradations.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p22"></span>8.  The same apostle again, when
speaking of spiritual gifts as diverse, and yet tending to harmonious
action, to illustrate a matter so great, and divine, and mysterious,
makes a comparison with the human body,—thus plainly intimating that
this flesh is the handiwork of God.  The whole passage, as found in the
Epistle to the Corinthians, is so much to the point, that though it is
long, I think it not amiss to insert it all:  "Now concerning spiritual
gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.  Ye know that ye were
Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. 
Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit
of God calleth Jesus accursed; and that no man can say that Jesus is the
Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.  Now there are diversities of gifts, but
the same Spirit.  And there are diversities of administrations, but the
same Lord.  And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same
God which worketh all in all.  But the manifestation of the Spirit is
given to every man to profit withal.  For to one is given by the Spirit
the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by
the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another
prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of
tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:  but all these
worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man
severally as He will.  For as the body is one, and hath many members,
and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body:  so also
is Christ.  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all
made to drink into one Spirit.  For the body is not one member, but
many.  If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the
body; is it therefore not of the body?  And if the ear shall say,
Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of
the body?  If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?  If
the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  But now hath God set
the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased Him.  And
if they were all one member, where were the body?  But now are they many
members, yet but one body.  And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have
no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble,
are necessary; and those members of the body which we think to be less
honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely
parts have more abundant comeliness.  For our comely parts have no need;
but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant
honor to that part which lacked:  that there should be no schism in the
body, but that the members should have the same care one for another. 
And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one
member be honored, all the members rejoice with it." <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md)   Apart altogether from Christian
faith, which would lead you to believe the apostle, if you have common
sense to perceive what is self-evident, let each examine and see for
himself the plain truth regarding those things of which the apostle
speaks,—what greatness belongs to the least, and what goodness to the
lowest; for these are the things which the apostle extols, in order to
illustrate by means of these common and visible bodily objects, unseen
spiritual realities of the most exalted nature.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p24"></span>9.  Whoever, then, denies that our
body and its members, which the apostle so approves and extols, are the
handiwork of God, <span id="page_268">p. 268</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-Page_268"></span>you see whom he contradicts, preaching
contrary to what you have received.  So, instead of refuting his
opinions, I may leave him to be accursed of all Christians.  The apostle
says, God tempered the body.  Faustus says, Not God, but *Hyle*. 
Anathemas are more suitable than arguments to such contradictions.  You
cannot say that God is here called the God of this world.  And if any
one understands the passage where this expression does occur to mean
that the devil blinds the minds of unbelievers, we grant that he does so
by his evil suggestions, from yielding to which, men lose the light of
righteousness in God’s righteous retribution.  This is all in accordance
with sacred Scripture.  The apostle himself speaks of temptation from
without:  "I fear lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and
purity that is in Christ." <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md)   To
the same purpose are the words, "Evil communications corrupt good
manners;" <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) and when he speaks of
a man deceiving himself, "Whoever thinketh himself to be anything, when
he is nothing, deceiveth himself;" <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) or again, in the passage already
quoted of the judgment of God, "God gave them over to a reprobate mind,
to do those things which are not convenient." <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md)   Similarly, in the Old Testament,
after the words, "God did not create death, nor hath He pleasure in the
destruction of the living," we read, "By the envy of the devil death
entered into the world." <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md)   And
again of death, that men may not put the blame from themselves, "The
wicked invite her with hands and voice; and thinking her a friend, they
are drawn down." <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md)   Elsewhere,
however, it is said, "Good and evil, life and death, riches and poverty,
are from the Lord God." <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md)   This
seems perplexing to people who do not understand that, apart from the
manifest judgment to follow hereafter upon every evil work, there is an
actual judgment at the time; so that in one action, besides the craft of
the deceiver and the wickedness of the voluntary agent, there is also
the just penalty of the judge:  for while the devil suggests, and man
consents, God abandons.  So, if you join the words, *God of this world*,
and understand that the devil blinds unbelievers by his mischievous
delusions, the meaning is not a bad one.  For the word God is not used
by itself, but with the qualification *of this world*, that is, of
wicked men, who seek to prosper only in this age.  In this sense the
world is also called evil, where it is written, "that He might deliver
us from this present evil age." <span id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md)
  In the same way, in the expression, "whose god is their belly," it is
only in connection with the word *whose* that the belly is called god. 
So also, in the Psalms, the devils would not be called gods without
adding "of the nations." <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md)   But
in the passage we are now considering it is not said, The god of this
world, or, Whose god is their belly, or, The gods of the nations are
devils; but simply, God has tempered the body, which can be understood
only of the true God, the Creator of all.  There is no disparaging
addition here, as in the other cases.  But perhaps Faustus will say that
God tempered the body, not as the maker of it, in the arrangement of its
members, but by mixing His light with it.  Thus Faustus would attribute
to some other being than God the construction of the body, and the
arrangement of its members, while God tempered the evil of the
construction by the mixture of His goodness.  Such are the inventions
with which the Manichæans cram feeble minds.  But God, in aid of the
feeble, by the mouth of the sacred writers rebukes this opinion.  For we
read a few verses before:  "God has placed the members every one of them
in the body, as it has pleased Him."  Evidently, God is said to have
tempered the body, because He has constructed it of many members, which
in their union preserve the variety of their respective functions.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p34"></span>10.  Do the Manichæans suppose that
the animals which, according to their wild notions, were constructed by
*Hyle* in the race of darkness, had not this harmonious action of their
members, commended by the apostle, before God mixed His light with them;
so that then the head did say to the feet, or the eye to the hand, I
have no need of thee?  This is not and cannot be the Manichæan doctrine,
for they describe the animals as using all these members, and speak of
them as creeping, walking, swimming, flying, each in its own kind.  They
could all see, too, and hear, and use the other senses, and nourish and
cherish their own bodies with appropriate means and appliances.  Hence,
moreover, they had the power of reproduction, for they are spoken of as
having offspring.  All these things, of which Faust speaks disparagingly
as the works of *Hyle*, could not be done without that harmonious
arrangement which the apostle praises and ascribes to God.  Is it not
now plain who is to be followed, and who is to be pronounced accursed? 
Indeed, the Manichæans tell us of animals that could speak; <span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span id="iv.ix.xxiii-Page_269"></span>and
their speeches were heard and understood and approved of by all
creatures, whether creeping things, or quadrupeds, or birds, or fish. 
Amazing and supernatural eloquence!  Especially as they had no
grammarian or elocutionist to teach them, and had not passed through the
painful experience of the cane and the birch.  Why, Faustus himself
began late in life to learn oratory, that he might discourse eloquently
on these absurdities; and with all his cleverness, after ruining his
health by study, his preaching has gained a mere handful of followers. 
What a pity that he was born in the light, and not in that region of
darkness!  If he had discoursed there against the light, the whole
animal creation, from the biped to the centipede, from the dragon to the
shell-fish, would have listened eagerly, and obeyed at once; whereas,
when he discourses here against the race of darkness, he is oftener
called eloquent than learned, and oftener still a false teacher of the
worst kind.  And among the few Manichæans who extol him as a great
teacher, he has none of the lower animals as his disciples; and not even
his horse is any the wiser for his master’s instructions, so that the
mixture of a part of deity seems only to make the animals more stupid. 
What absurdity is this!  When will these deluded beings have the sense
to compare the description in the Manichæan fiction of what the animals
were formerly in their own region, with what they are now in this
world?  Then their bodies were strong, now they are feeble; then their
power of vision was such that they were induced to invade the region of
God on account of the beauty which they saw, now it is too weak to face
the rays of the sun; then they had intelligence sufficient to understand
a discourse addressed to them, now they have no ability of the kind;
then this astonishing and effective eloquence was natural, now eloquence
of the most meagre kind requires diligent study and preparation.  How
many good things did the race of darkness lose by the mixture of good!

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p35"></span>11.  Faustus has displayed his
ingenuity, in the remarks to which I am now replying, by making for
himself a long list of opposites—health and sickness, riches and
poverty, white and black, cold and hot, sweet and bitter.  We need not
say much about black and white.  Or, if there is a character for good or
evil in colors, so that white must be ascribed to God and black to
*Hyle*; if God threw a white color on the wings of birds, when *Hyle*,
as the Manichæans say, created them, where had the crows gone to when
the swans got whitened?  Nor need we discuss heat and cold, for both are
good in moderation, and dangerous in excess.  With regard to the rest,
Faustus probably intended that good and evil, which he might as well
have put first, should be understood as including the rest, so that
health, riches, white, hot, sweet, should belong to good; and sickness,
poverty, black, cold, bitter, to evil.  The ignorance and folly of this
is obvious.  It might look like reviling if I were to take up separately
white and black, hot and cold, sweet and bitter, health and sickness. 
For if white and sweet are both good, and black and bitter evil, how is
it that most grapes and all olives become black as they become sweet,
and so get good by getting evil?  And if heat and health are both good,
and cold and sickness evil, why do bodies become sick when heated?  Is
it healthy to have fever?  But I let these things pass, for they may
have been put down hastily, or they may have been given as merely
instances of opposition, and not as being good and bad, especially as it
is nowhere stated that the fire among the race of darkness is cold, so
that heat in this case must unquestionably be evil.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p36"></span>12.  We pass on, then, to health,
riches, sweetness, which Faustus evidently accounts good in his
contrasts.  Was there no health of body in the race of darkness where
animals were born and grew up and brought forth, and had such vitality,
that when some that were with child were taken, as the story is, and
were put in bonds in heaven, even the abortive offspring of a premature
birth, falling from heaven to earth, nevertheless lived, and grew, and
produced the innumerable kinds of animals which now exist?  Or were
there no riches where trees could grow not only in water and wind, but
in smoke and fire, and could bear such a rich produce, that animals,
according to their several kinds, sprang from the fruit, and were
provided with the means of subsistence from those fertile trees, and
showed how well fed they were by a numerous progeny?  And all this where
there was no toil in cultivation, and no inclement change from summer to
winter, for there was no sun to give variety to the seasons by his
annual course.  There must have been perennial productiveness where the
trees were not only born in their own element, but had a supply of
appropriate nourishment to make them constantly fertile; as we see
orange-trees bearing fruit all the year round if they are well watered. 
The riches must have been abundant, and they must have been secure from
harm; for there could be no fear of hailstorms when there were no
light-gatherers who, in your fable, set the thunder in motion.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p37"></span>13.  Nor would the beings in this race
of <span id="page_270">p. 270</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-Page_270"></span>darkness have sought for food if it had
not been sweet and pleasant, so that they would have died from want. 
For we find that all bodies have their peculiar wants, according to
which food is either agreeable or offensive.  If it is agreeable, it is
said to be sweet or pleasant; if it is offensive, it is said to be
bitter or sour, or in some way disagreeable.  In human beings we find
that one desires food which another dislikes, from a difference in
constitution or habit or state of health.  Still more, animals of quite
different make can find pleasure in food which is disagreeable to us. 
Why else should the goats feed so eagerly on the wild olives?  This food
is sweet to them, as in some sicknesses honey tastes bitter to us.  To a
thoughtful inquirer these things suggest the beauty of the arrangement
in which each finds what suits it, and the greatness of the good which
extends from the lowest to the highest, and from the material to the
spiritual.  As for the race of darkness, if an animal sprung from any
element fed on what was produced by that element, doubtless the food
must have been sweet from its appropriateness.  Again, if this animal
had found food of another element, the want of appropriateness would
have appeared in its offensiveness to the taste.  Such offensiveness is
called sourness, or bitterness, or disagreeableness, or something of the
kind; or if its adverse nature is such as to destroy the harmony of the
bodily constitution, and so take away life or reduce the strength, it is
called poison, simply on account of this want of appropriateness, while
it may nourish the kind of life to which it is appropriate.  So, if a
hawk eat the bread which is our daily food, it dies; and we die if we
eat hellebore, which cattle often feed on, and which may itself in a
certain form be used as a medicine.  If Faustus had known or thought of
this, he would not have given poison and antidote as an example of the
two natures of good and evil, as if God were the antidote and *Hyle* the
poison.  For the same thing, of one and the same nature, kills or cures,
as it is used appropriately or inappropriately.  In the Manichæan
legends, their god might be said to have been poison to the race of
darkness; for he so injured their bodies, that from being strong, they
became utterly feeble.  But then again, as the light was itself taken,
and subjected to loss and injury, it may be said to have been poison to
itself.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p38"></span>14.  Instead of one good and one evil
principle, you seem to make both good or both evil, or rather two good
and two evil; for they are good in themselves, and evil to one another. 
We may see afterwards which is the better or the worse; but meanwhile we
may think of them as both good in themselves.  Thus God reigned in one
region, while *Hyle* reigned in the other.  There was health in both
kingdoms, and rich produce in both; both had a numerous progeny, and
both tasted the sweetness of pleasures suitable to their respective
natures.  But the race of darkness, say the Manichæans, excepting the
part which was evil to the light which it bordered on, was also evil to
itself.  As, however, I have already pointed out many good things in it,
if you can point out its evils, there will still be two good kingdoms,
though the one where there are no evils will be the better of the two. 
What, then, do you call its evils?  They plundered, and killed, and
devoured one another, according to Faustus.  But if they did nothing
else than this, how could such numerous hosts be born and grow up to
maturity?  They must have enjoyed peace and tranquillity too.  But,
allowing the kingdom where there is no discord to be the better of the
two, still they should both be called good, rather than one good and the
other bad.  Thus the better kingdom will be that where they killed
neither themselves nor one another; and the worse, or less good, where,
though they fought with one another, each separate animal preserved its
own nature in health and safety.  But we cannot make much difference
between your god and the prince of darkness, whom no one opposed, whose
reign was acknowledged by all, and whose proposals were unanimously
agreed to.  All this implies great peace and harmony.  Those kingdoms
are happy where all agree heartily in obedience to the king.  Moreover,
the rule of this prince extended not only to his own species, or to
bipeds whom you make the parents of mankind, but to all kinds of
animals, who waited in his presence, obeying his commands, and believing
his declarations.  Do you think people are so stupid as not to recognize
the attributes of deity in your description of this prince, or to think
it possible that you can have another?  If the authority of this prince
rested on his resources, he must have been very powerful; if on his
fame, he must have been renowned; if on love, the regard must have been
universal; if on fear, he must have kept the strictest order.  If some
evils, then, were mixed with so many good things, who that knows the
meaning of words would call this the nature of evil?  Besides, if you
call this the nature of evil, because it was not only evil to the other
nature, but was also evil in itself, was there no evil, think you, in
the dire necessity to which your god was subjected before the mixture
with <span id="page_271">p. 271</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-Page_271"></span>the opposite nature, so that he was
compelled to fight with it, and to send his own members to be swallowed
up so mercilessly as to be beyond the hope of complete recovery?  This
was a great evil in that nature before its mixture with the only thing
you allow to be evil.  Your god must either have had it in his power not
to be injured and sullied by the race of darkness, in which case his own
folly must have brought him into trouble; or if his substance was liable
to corruption, the object of your worship is not the incorruptible God
of whom the apostle speaks.  <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md)  
Does not, then this liability to corruption, even apart from the actual
experience, seem to you to be an evil in your god?

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p40"></span>15.  It is plain, moreover, that
either he must have been destitute of prescience,—a great defect,
surely, in the Deity, not to know what is coming; or if he had
prescience, he can never have felt secure, but must have been in
constant terror, which you must allow to be a serious evil.  There must
have been the fear at every moment, that the time might be come for that
conflict in which his members suffered such loss and contamination, that
to liberate and purify them costs infinite labor, and, after all, can be
done only partially.  If it is going too far to attribute this state of
alarm to the Deity himself, his members at least must have dreaded the
prospect of suffering all these evils.  Then, again, if they were
ignorant of what was to happen, the substance of your god must have been
so far wanting in prescience.  How many evils do you reckon in your
chief good?  Perhaps you will say that they had no fear, because they
foresaw, along with the suffering, their liberation and triumph.  But
still they must have feared for their companions, if they knew that they
were to be cut off from their kingdom, and bound for ever in the mass of
darkness.

<span id="iv.ix.xxiii-p41"></span>16.  Had they not the charity to feel
a kindly sympathy for those who were doomed to suffer eternal
punishment, without having committed any sin?  These souls that were to
be bound up with the mass, were not they too part of your god?  Were
they not of the same origin, the same substance?  They at least must
have felt grief or fear in the prospect of their own eternal bondage. 
To say that they did not know what was to happen, while the others did,
is to make one and the same substance partly acquainted with the future,
and partly ignorant.  How can you call this substance the pure, and
perfect, and supreme good, if there were such evils in it, even before
its mixture with the evil principle?  You will have to confess your two
principles either both good or both evil.  If you make two evils, you
may make either of them the worse, as you please.  But if you make two
goods, we shall have to inquire which you make the better.  Meanwhile
there is an end to your doctrine of two principles, one good and the
other evil, which are in fact two gods, one good and the other evil. 
But if hurting another is evil, they both hurt one another.  Perhaps the
greater evil was in the principle that first began the attack.  But if
one began the injury, the other returned it; and not by the law of
compensation, an eye for an eye, which you are foolish enough to find
fault with, but with far greater severity.  You must choose which you
will call the worse,—the one that began the injury, or the one that had
the will and the power to do still greater injury.  The one tried to get
a share in the enjoyment of light; the other effected the entire
overthrow of its opponent.  If the one had got what it desired, it would
certainly have done no harm to itself.  But the other, in the
discomfiture of its adversary, did great mischief to part of itself;
reminding us of the well-known passionate exclamation, which is on
record as having been actually used, "Perish our friends, if that will
rid us of our enemies." <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md)   For
part of your god was sent to suffer hopeless contamination, that there
might be a covering for the mass in which the enemy is to be buried for
ever alive.  So much will he continue to be dreaded even when conquered
and bound, that the security, such as it is, of one part of the deity
must be purchased by the eternal misery of the other parts.  Such is the
harmlessness of the good principle!  Your god, it appears, is guilty of
the crime with which you charge the race of darkness—of injuring both
friends and enemies.  The charge is proved in the case of your god, by
that final mass in which his enemies are confined, while his own
subjects are involved in it.  In fact, the principle that you call god
is the more injurious of the two, both to friends and to enemies.  In
the case of *Hyle*, there was no desire to destroy the opposite kingdom,
but only to possess it; and though some of its subjects were put to
death by the violence of others, they appeared again in other forms, so
that in the alternation of life and death they had intervals of
enjoyment in their history.  But your god, with all the omnipotence and
perfect excellence that you ascribe to him, dooms his enemies to eternal
destruction, and his <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="iv.ix.xxiii-Page_272"></span>friends to eternal punishment.  And the
height of insanity is in believing that while internal contest occasions
the injury of the members of *Hyle*, victory brings punishment to the
members of God.  What means this folly?  To use Faustus’ comparison of
God and *Hyle* to the antidote and poison, the antidote seems to be more
mischievous than the poison.  We do not hear of *Hyle* shutting up God
for ever in a mass of darkness, or driving its own members into it; or,
which is worst of all, slandering this unfortunate remnant, as an excuse
for not effecting its purification.  For Manichæus, in his Fundamental
Epistle, says that these souls deserved to be thus punished, because
they allowed themselves to be led away from their original brightness,
and became enemies of holy light; whereas it was God himself that sent
them to lose themselves in the region of darkness, that light might be
opposed to light:  which was unjust, if he forced them against their
will; while, if they went willingly, he is ungrateful in punishing
them.  These souls can never have been happy, if they were tormented
with fear before the conflict, from knowing that they were to become
enemies to their original principle, and then in the conflict were
hopelessly contaminated, and afterwards eternally condemned.  On the
other hand, they can never have been divine, if before the conflict they
were unaware of what was coming, from want of prescience, and then
showed feebleness in the conflict, and suffered misery afterwards.  And
what is true of them must be true of God, since they are of the same
substance.  Is there any hope of your seeing the folly of these
blasphemies?  You attempt, indeed, to vindicate the goodness of God, by
asserting that *Hyle* when shut up is prevented from doing any more
injury to itself.  *Hyle*, it seems, is to get some good, when it has no
longer any good mixed with it.  Perhaps, as God before the conflict had
the evil of necessity, when the good was unmixed with evil, so *Hyle*
after the conflict is to have the good of rest, when the evil is unmixed
with good.  Your principles are thus either two evils, one worse than
the other; or two goods, both imperfect, but one better than the other. 
The better, however, is the more miserable; for if the issue of this
great conflict is that the enemy gets some good by the cessation of
mutual injuries in *Hyle*, while God’s own subjects suffer the serious
evil of being driven into the mass of darkness, we may ask who has got
the victory.  The poison, we are to understand, is *Hyle*, where,
nevertheless, animal life found a plentiful supply of the means of
growth and productiveness; while the antidote is God, who could condemn
his own members, but could not restore them.  In reality, it is as
absurd to call the one *Hyle*, as it is to call the other God.  These
are the follies of men who turn to fables because they cannot bear sound
doctrine. <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md)
