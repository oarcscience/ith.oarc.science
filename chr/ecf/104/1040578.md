class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xci-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But you scatter thorns and tares, not seeds of corn so that you ought
to be burned together with them at the last judgment.  We do not utter
curses; but every thorny conscience is bound under this penalty by the
sentence which God has pronounced."

<span id="v.v.iv.xci-p2"></span>199.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xci-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Surely, when you
mention tares, it might bring to your minds the thought of wheat as
well; for both have been commanded to grow together in the field until
the harvest.  But you fix the eye of malice fiercely on the tares, and
maintain, in opposition to the express declaration of Christ, that they
alone have grown throughout the earth, with the exception of Africa
alone.
