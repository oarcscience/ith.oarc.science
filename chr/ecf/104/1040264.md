<span id="v.iv.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—</span>3.  "When, on the calends
of September, very many bishops from the provinces of Africa, <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md) Numidia, and Mauritania, with their
presbyters and deacons, had met together at Carthage, a great part of
the laity also being present; and when the letter addressed by
Jubaianus <span id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) to Cyprian, as also
the answer of Cyprian to Jubaianus, on the subject of baptizing
heretics, had been read, Cyprian said:  ‘Ye have heard, most beloved
colleagues, what Jubaianus, our fellow-bishop, has written to me,
consulting my moderate ability concerning the unlawful and profane
baptism of heretics, and what answer I gave him,—giving a judgment which
we have once and again and often given, that heretics coming to the
Church ought to be baptized, and sanctified with the baptism of the
Church.  Another letter of Jubaianus has likewise been read to you, in
which, agreeably to his sincere and religious devotion, in answer to our
epistle, he not only expressed his assent, but returned thanks also,
acknowledging that he had received instruction.  It remains that we
severally declare our opinion on this subject, judging no one, nor
depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from us.  For
no one of us sets himself up as a bishop of bishops, or, by tyrannical
terror, forces his colleagues to a necessity of obeying, inasmuch as
every bishop, in the free use of his liberty and power, has the right of
forming his own judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he
can himself judge another.  But we must all await the judgment of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who alone has the power both of setting us in the
government of His Church, and of judging of our acts therein.’"
