<span id="v.iv.viii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—</span>20.  Januarius of
Lambæse <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) said:  "Following the
authority of the holy Scriptures, I pronounce that all heretics should
be baptized, and so admitted into the holy Church." <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xiii-p4"></span>21.  To him we answer, that,
following the authority of the holy Scriptures, a universal Council of
the whole world decreed that the baptism of Christ was not to be
disavowed even when found among heretics.  But if he had brought forward
any proof from the Scriptures, we should have shown either that they
were not against us, or even that they were for us, as we proceed to do
with him who follows.

<span id="v.iv.viii.xiii-p2"></span> Lambæse (Lambese) was one of the
chief cities in southern Numidia.  This Januarius is not unlikely
identical with the first of that name in Cypr. Ep. lxvii.<span
id="v.iv.viii.xiii-p2.1"></span>, and with the one of Epp. lxii. and
lxx.  For an opponent of Cyprian in Lambese, see Cypr. Epp. xxxvi. and
lix.
