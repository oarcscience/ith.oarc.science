id="iv.viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—The Form of the Region of
Light the Worse of the Two.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xxiii-p2"></span>Well, then, if this is so, the region
of darkness is clearly touched on two sides by the region of light.  And
if it is touched on two sides, it must touch on two.  So much for its
being on one side, as we were told before.

<span id="iv.viii.xxiii-p3"></span>24.  And what an unseemly appearance
is this of the region of light!—like a cloven arch, with a black wedge
inserted below, bounded only in the direction of the cleft, and having a
void space interposed where the boundless emptiness stretches above the
region of darkness.  Indeed, the form of the region of darkness is
better than that of the region of light:  for the former cleaves, the
latter is cloven; the former fills the gap which is made in the latter;
the former has no void in it, while the latter is undefined in all
directions, except that where it is filled up by the wedge of darkness. 
In an ignorant and greedy notion of giving more honor to a number of
pans than to a single one, so that the region of light should have six,
three upwards and three downwards, they have made this region be split
up, instead of sundering the other.  For, according to this figure,
though there may be no commixture of darkness with light, there is
certainly penetration.
