<span id="v.iv.vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—</span>8.  Truly, when I look
at the actual words of Cyprian, I am warned to say some things which are
very necessary for the solution of this question.  "For if they were to
see," he says, "that it was settled and established by our formal
decision and vote, that the baptism with which they are baptized in
heresy is considered just and lawful, they will think that they are in
just and lawful possession of the Church also, and all its other
gifts." <span id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md)   He does not say
"that they will think they are in possession," but "in just and lawful
possession of the gifts of the Church."  But we say that we cannot allow
that they are in just and lawful possession of baptism.  That they are
in possession of it we cannot deny, when we recognize the sacrament of
the Lord in the words of the gospel.  They have therefore lawful
baptism, but they do not have it lawfully.  For whosoever has it both in
Catholic unity, and living worthily of it, both has lawful baptism and
has it lawfully; but whosoever has it either within the Catholic Church
itself, as chaff mixed with the wheat, or outside, as chaff carried away
by the wind, has indeed lawful baptism, but not lawfully.  For he has it
as he uses it.  But the man does not use it lawfully who uses it against
the law,—which every one does, who, being baptized, yet leads an
abandoned life, whether inside or without the Church.
