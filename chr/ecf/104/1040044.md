<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Scripture Precepts and Examples
of Fortitude.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p2"></span>42.  Instead of quoting here authorities
from the New Testament, where it is said, "Tribulation worketh patience;
and patience, experience and experience, hope;" <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) and where, in addition to these words,
there is proof and confirmation of them from the example of those who
spoke them; I will rather summon an example of patience from the Old
Testament, against which the Manichæans make fierce assaults.  Nor will
I refer to the man who, in the midst of great bodily suffering, and with
a dreadful disease in his limbs, not only bore human evils, but
discoursed of things divine.  Whoever gives considerate attention to the
utterances of this man, will learn from every one of them what value is
to be attached to those things which men try to keep in their power, and
in so doing are themselves brought by passion into bondage, so that they
become the slaves of mortal things, while seeking ignorantly to be their
masters.  This man, in the loss of all his wealth, and on being suddenly
reduced to the greatest poverty, kept his mind so unshaken and fixed
upon God, as to manifest that these things were not great in his view,
but that he was great in relation to them, and God to him. <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)   If this mind were to be found in men
in our day, we should not be so strongly cautioned in the New Testament
against the possession of these things in order that we may be perfect;
for to have these things without cleaving to them is much more admirable
than not to have them at all. <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md)

<span id="iv.iv.xxv-p6"></span>43.  But since we are speaking here of
bearing pain and bodily sufferings, I pass from this man, great as he
was, indomitable as he was:  this is the case of a man.  But these
Scriptures present to me a woman of amazing fortitude, and I must at
once go on to her case.  This woman, along with seven children, allowed
the tyrant and executioner to extract her vitals from her body rather
than a profane word from her mouth, encouraging her sons by her
exhortations, though she suffered in the tortures of their bodies, and
was herself to undergo what she called on them to bear. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md)   What patience could be greater than
this?  And yet why should we be astonished that the love of God,
implanted in her inmost heart, bore up against tyrant, and executioner,
and pain, and sex, and natural affection?  Had she not heard, "Precious
in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints?" <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)   Had she not heard, "A patient man is
better than the mightiest?" <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)  
Had she not heard, "All that is appointed <span id="page_54">p.
54</span> <span id="iv.iv.xxv-Page_54"></span>thee receive; and in pain
bear it; and in abasement keep thy patience:  for in fire are gold and
silver tried?" <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)   Had she not
heard, "The fire tries the vessels of the potter, and for just men is
the trial of tribulation?" <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)  
These she knew, and many other precepts of fortitude written in these
books, which alone existed at that time, by the same divine Spirit who
writes those in the New Testament.

was the ability to use without abusing, to have without cleaving to the
good things which God provides.—A.H.N.\]
