<span id="iv.x.l-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—Augustin Prays that the Manichæans
May Be Restored to Their Senses.</span>

<span id="iv.x.l-p2"></span>O great is Thy patience, Lord, full of
compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and
true; <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134) who makest Thy sun to
rise upon the good and the evil, and who sendest rain upon the just and
the unjust; <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135) who willest not
the death of the sinner, so much as that he return and live; <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136) who <span id="page_365">p.
365</span> <span id="iv.x.l-Page_365"></span>reproving in parts, dost
give place to repentance, that wickedness having been abandoned, they
may believe on Thee, O Lord; <span id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137)
who by Thy patience dost lead to repentance, although many according to
the hardness of their heart and their impenitent heart treasure up for
themselves wrath against the day of wrath and of the revelation of Thy
righteous judgment, who wilt render to every man according to his
works; <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138) who in the day when a
man shall have turned from his iniquity to Thy mercy and truth, wilt
forget all his iniquities: <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139)  
stand before us, grant unto us that through our ministry, by which Thou
hast been pleased to refute this execrable and too horrible error, as
many have already been liberated, many also may be liberated, and
whether through the sacrament of Thy holy baptism, or through the
sacrifice of a broken spirit and a contrite and humbled heart, <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140) in the sorrow of repentance, they
may deserve to receive the remission of their sins and blasphemies, by
which through ignorance they have offended Thee.  For nothing is of any
avail, save Thy surpassing mercy and power, and the truth of Thy
baptism, and the keys of the kingdom of heaven in Thy holy Church; so
that we must not despair of men as long as by Thy patience they live on
this earth, who even knowing how great an evil it is to think or to say
such things about Thee, are detained in that malign profession on
account of the use or the attainment of temporal or earthly convenience,
if rebuked by Thy reproaches they in any way flee to Thy ineffable
goodness, and prefer to all the enticements of the carnal life, the
heavenly and eternal life.
