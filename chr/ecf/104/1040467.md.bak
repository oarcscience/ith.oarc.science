<span id="v.v.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—</span>11.  Lastly, if they are
willing to give the name of dead neither to the wicked man whose sin is
hidden, nor to him whose sin is manifest, but who has yet not been
condemned by them, but only to him whose sin is manifest and condemned,
so that whosoever is baptized by him is himself baptized by the dead,
and his washing profits him nothing; what are we to say of those whom
their own party have condemned "by the unimpeachable voice of a plenary
Council," <span id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941.md) together with
Maximianus and the others who ordained him,—I mean Felicianus of Musti,
and Prætextatus of Assura, of whom I speak in the meantime, who are
counted among the twelve ordainers of Maximianus, as erecting an altar
in opposition to their altar at which Primianus stands?  They surely are
reckoned by them among the dead.  To this we have the express testimony
of the noble decree of that Council of theirs which formerly called
forth shouts of unreserved  <span id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942.md)
applause when it was recited among them for the purpose of being
decreed, but which would now be received in silence if we should chance
to recite it in their ears; whereas they should rather have been slow at
first to rejoice in its eloquence, lest they should afterwards come to
mourn over it when its credit was destroyed.  For in it they speak in
the following terms of the followers of Maximianus, who were shut out
from their communion:  "Seeing that the shipwrecked members of certain
men have been dashed by the waves of truth upon the sharp rocks, and
after the fashion of the Egyptians, the shores are covered with the
bodies of the dying; whose punishment is intensified in death itself,
since after their life has been wrung from them by the avenging waters,
they fail to find so much as burial."  In such gross terms indeed, do
they insult those who were guilty of schism from their body, that they
call them dead and unburied; but certainly they ought to have wished
that they might obtain burial, if it were only that they might not have
seen Optatus Gildonianus advancing with a military force, and like a
sweeping wave that dashes beyond its fellows, sucking back Felicianus
and Prætextatus once again within their pale, out of the multitude of
bodies lying unburied on the shore.
