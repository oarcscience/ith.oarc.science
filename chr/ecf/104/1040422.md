<span id="v.iv.ix.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—</span>44.  Geminius of
Furni <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md) said:  "Certain of our
colleagues may prefer heretics to themselves, they cannot prefer them to
us:  and therefore what we have once decreed we hold, that we should
baptize those who come to us from heretics." <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xxiii-p4"></span>45.  This man also acknowledges most
openly that certain of his colleagues entertained opinions contrary to
his own:  whence again and again the love of unity is confirmed, because
they were separated from one another by no schism, till God should
reveal to one or other of them anything wherein they were otherwise
minded. <span id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823.md)   But to him our
answer is, that his colleagues did not prefer heretics to themselves,
but that, as the baptism of Christ is acknowledged in the covetous, in
the fraudulent, in robbers, in murderers, so also they acknowledged it
in heretics.
