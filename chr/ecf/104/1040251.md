<span id="v.iv.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>12.  Let them see how
many things, and what important things, are of no avail, if a certain
single thing be wanting, and let them see what that one thing is.  And
herein let them hear not my words, but those of the apostle:  "Though I
speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am
become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.  And though I have the
gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and
though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
charity, I am nothing." <span id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165)  
What does it profit them, therefore, if they have both the voice of
angels in the sacred mysteries, and the gift of prophecy, as had
Caiaphas <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166) and Saul, <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167) that so they may be found
prophesying, of whom Holy Scripture testifies that they were worthy of
condemnation?  If they not only know, but even possess the sacraments,
as Simon Magus did; <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168) if they
have faith, as the devils confessed Christ (for we must not suppose that
they did not believe when they said, "What have we to do with Thee, O
Son of God?  We know Thee who Thou art" <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169) ; if they distribute of themselves
their own substance to the poor, as many do, not only in the Catholic
Church, but in the different heretical bodies; if, under the pressure of
any persecution, they give their bodies with us to be burned for the
faith which they like us confess:  yet because they do all these things
apart from the Church, not "forbearing one another in love," nor
"endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,"
 <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170) insomuch as they have not
charity, they cannot attain to eternal salvation, even with all those
good things which profit them not.
