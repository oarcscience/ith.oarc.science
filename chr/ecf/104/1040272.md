<span id="v.iv.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—</span>15.  But what attitude do
they assume, when it is shown that the holy Cyprian, though he did not
himself admit as members of the Church those who had been baptized in
heresy or schism, yet held communion with those who did admit them,
according to his express declaration, "Judging no one, nor depriving any
one of the right of communion if he differ from us?" <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247)   If he was polluted by communion
with persons of this kind, why do they follow his authority in the
question of baptism?  But if he was not polluted by communion with them,
why do they not follow his example in maintaining unity?  Have they
anything to urge in their defense except the plea, "We choose to have it
so?"  What other answer have any sinful or wicked men to the discourse
of truth or justice,—the voluptuous, for instance, the drunkards,
adulterers, and those who are impure in any way, thieves, robbers,
murderers, plunderers, evil-doers, idolaters,—what other answer can they
make when convicted by the voice of truth, except "I choose to do it;"
"It is my pleasure so"?  And if they have in them a tinge of
Christianity, they say further, "Who art thou that judgest another man’s
servant?" <span id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248)   Yet these have so
much more remains of modesty, that when, in accordance with divine and
human law, they meet with punishment for their abandoned life and deeds,
they do not style themselves martyrs; while the Donatists wish at once
to lead a sacrilegious life and enjoy a blameless reputation, to suffer
no punishment for their wicked deeds, and to gain a martyr’s glory in
their just punishment.  As if they were not experiencing the greater
mercy and patience of God, in proportion as "executing His judgments
upon them by little and little, He giveth them place of
repentance," <span id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249) and ceases not
to redouble His scourgings in this life; that, considering what they
suffer, and why they suffer it, they may in time grow wise; and that
those who have received the baptism of the party of Maximianus in order
to preserve the unity of Donatus, may the more readily embrace the
baptism of the whole world in order to preserve the peace of Christ;
that they may be restored to the root, may be reconciled to the unity of
the Church, may see that they have nothing left for them to say, though
something yet remains for them to do; that for their former deeds the
sacrifice of loving-kindness may be offered to a long-suffering God,
whose unity they have broken by their wicked sin, on whose sacraments
they have inflicted such a lasting wrong.  For "the Lord is merciful and
gracious, slow to anger, plenteous in mercy and truth." <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250)   Let them embrace His mercy and
long-suffering in this life, and fear His truth in the next.  For He
willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from
his way and live; <span id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251) because He
bends His judgment against the wrongs that have been inflicted on Him. 
This is our exhortation.
