<span id="iv.viii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Why Manichæus Called Himself an
Apostle of Christ.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.vii-p2"></span>7.  For I am at a loss to see why this
epistle begins, "Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus Christ," and not
Paraclete, an apostle of Jesus Christ.  Or if the Paraclete sent by
Christ sent Manichæus, why do we read, "Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus
Christ," instead of Manichæus, an apostle of the Paraclete?  If you say
that it is Christ Himself who is the Holy Spirit, you contradict the
very Scripture, where the Lord says, "And I will send you another
Paraclete."  <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md)   Again, if you
justify your putting of Christ’s name, not because it is Christ Himself
who is also the Paraclete, but because they are both of the same
substance,—that is, not because they are one person, but one existence
\[*non quia unus est, sed quia unum sunt*\],—Paul too might have used
the words, Paul, an apostle of God the Father; for the Lord said, "I and
the Father are one." <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md)   Paul
nowhere uses these words; nor does any of the apos<span id="page_132">p.
132</span> <span id="iv.viii.vii-Page_132"></span>tles write himself an
apostle of the Father.  Why then this new fashion?  Does it not savor of
trickery of some kind or other?  For if he thought it made no
difference, why did he not for the sake of variety in some epistles call
himself an apostle of Christ, and in others of the Paraclete?  But in
every one that I know of, he writes, of Christ; and not once, of the
Paraclete.  What do we suppose to be the reason of this, but that pride,
the mother of all heretics, impelled the man to desire to seem to have
been sent by the Paraclete, but to have been taken into so close a
relation as to get the name of Paraclete himself?  As the man Jesus
Christ was not sent by the Son of God, that is, the power and wisdom of
God—by which all things were made, but, according to the Catholic faith,
was taken into such a relation as to be Himself the Son of God—that is,
that in Himself the wisdom of God was displayed in the healing of
sinners,—so Manichæus wished it to be thought that he was so taken up by
the Holy Spirit, whom Christ promised, that we are henceforth to
understand that the names Manichæus and Holy Spirit alike signify the
apostle of Jesus Christ,—that is, one sent by Jesus Christ, who promised
to send him.  Singular audacity this! and unutterable sacrilege!
