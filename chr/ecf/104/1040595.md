class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.cviii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"By this sentence, again, the apostle places in the same category those
who have fellowship in the consciousness of evil.  ‘Worthy of death,’ he
says, ‘are both those who do such things, and those who consent with
those that do them.’" <span id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md)

<span id="v.v.iv.cviii-p3"></span>245.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.cviii-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I care not in
what manner you have used these words, they are true.  And this is the
substance of the teaching of the Catholic Church, that there is a great
difference between those who consent because they take pleasure in such
things, and those who tolerate while they dislike them.  The former make
themselves chaff, while they follow the barrenness of the chaff; the
latter are the grain.  Let them wait for Christ, who bears the
winnowing-fan, that they may be separated from the chaff.
