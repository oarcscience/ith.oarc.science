<span id="iv.iv.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—Another Kind of Men Living
Together in Cities.  Fasts of Three Days.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxxv-p2"></span>70.  Still I would not on this account
cast a slight upon a praiseworthy class of Christians,—those, namely,
who live together in cities, quite apart from common life.  I saw at
Milan a lodging-house of saints, in number not a few, presided over by
one presbyter, a man of great excellence and learning.  At Rome I knew
several places where there was in each one eminent for weight of
character, and prudence, and divine knowledge, presiding over all the
rest who lived with him, in Christian charity, and sanctity, and
liberty.  These, too, are not burdensome to any one; but, in the Eastern
fashion, and on the authority of the Apostle Paul, they maintain
themselves with their own hands.  I was told that many practised fasts
of quite amazing severity, not merely taking only one meal daily towards
night, which is everywhere quite common, but very often continuing for
three days or more in succession without food or drink.  And this among
not men only, but women, who also live together in great numbers as
widows or virgins, gaining a livelihood by spinning and weaving, and
presided over in each case by a woman of the greatest judgment and
experience, skilled and accomplished not only in directing and forming
moral conduct, but also in instructing the understanding. <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141)

<span id="iv.iv.xxxv-p4"></span>71.  With all this, no one is pressed to
endure hardships for which he is unfit; nothing is imposed on any one
against his will; nor is he condemned by the rest because he con<span
id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span id="iv.iv.xxxv-Page_61"></span>fesses
himself too feeble to imitate them:  for they bear in mind how strongly
Scripture enjoins charity on all:  they bear in mind "To the pure all
things are pure," <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142) and "Not that
which entereth into your mouth defileth you, but that which cometh out
of it." <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143)   Accordingly, all their
endeavors are concerned not about the rejection of kinds of food as
polluted, but about the subjugation of inordinate desire and the
maintenance of brotherly love.  They remember, "Meats for the belly, and
the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them;" <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144) and again, "Neither if we eat shall we
abound, nor if we refrain from eating shall we be in want;" <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145) and, above all, this:  "It is good, my
brethren, not to eat flesh, nor drink wine, nor anything whereby thy
brother is offended;" for this passage shows that love is the end to be
aimed at in all these things.  "For one man," he says, "believes that he
can eat all things:  another, who is weak, eateth herbs.  He that
eateth, let him not despise him that eateth not; and let not him that
eateth not judge him that eateth:  for God hath approved him.  Who art
thou that thou shouldest judge another man’s servant?  To his own master
he stands or fails; but he shall stand:  for God is able to make him to
stand."  And a little after:  "He that eateth, to the Lord he eateth,
and giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth
not, and giveth God thanks."  And also in what follows:  "So every one
of us shall give account of himself to God.  Let us not, then, any more
judge one another:  but judge this rather, that ye place no
stumbling-block, or cause of offence, in the way of a brother.  I know,
and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing common in
itself:  but to him that thinketh anything to be common, to him it is
common."  Could he have shown better that it is not in the things we
eat, but in the mind, that there is a power able to pollute it, and
therefore that even those who are fit to think lightly of these things,
and know perfectly that they are not polluted if they take any food in
mental superiority, without being gluttons, should still have regard to
charity?  See what he adds:  "For if thy brother be grieved with thy
meat, now walkest thou not charitably." <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146)

<span id="iv.iv.xxxv-p10"></span>72.  Read the rest:  it is too long to
quote all.  You will find that those able to think lightly of such
things,—that is, those of greater strength and stability,—are told that
they must nevertheless abstain, lest those should be offended who from
their weakness are still in need of such abstinence.  The people I was
describing know and observe these things; for they are Christians, not
heretics.  They understand Scripture according to the apostolic
teaching, not according to the presumptuous and fictitious name of
apostle. <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147)   Him that eats not no
one despises; him that eats no one judges; he who is weak eats herbs. 
Many who are strong, however, do this for the sake of the weak; with
many the reason for so doing is not this, but that they may have a
cheaper diet, and may lead a life of the greatest tranquillity, with the
least expensive provision for the support of the body.  "For all things
are lawful for me," he says; "but I will not be brought under the power
of any."  <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148)   Thus many do not eat
flesh, and yet do not superstitiously regard it as unclean.  And so the
same people who abstain when in health take it when unwell without any
fear, if it is required as a cure.  Many drink no wine; but they do not
think that wine defiles them; for they cause it to be given with the
greatest propriety and moderation to people of languid temperament, and,
in short, to all who cannot have bodily health without it.  When some
foolishly refuse it, they counsel them as brothers not to let a silly
superstition make them weaker instead of making them holier.  They read
to them the apostle’s precept to his disciple to "take a little wine for
his many infirmities." <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149)   Then
they diligently exercise piety; bodily exercise, they know, profiteth
for a short time, as the same apostle says. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150)

<span id="iv.iv.xxxv-p15"></span>73.  Those, then who are able, and they
are without number, abstain both from flesh and from wine for two
reasons:  either for the weakness of their brethren, or for their own
liberty.  Charity is principally attended to.  There is charity in their
choice of diet, charity in their speech, charity in their dress, charity
in their looks.  Charity is the point where they meet, and the plan by
which they act.  To transgress against charity is thought criminal, like
transgressing against God.  Whatever opposes this is attacked and
expelled; whatever injures it is not allowed to continue for a single
day.  They know that it has been so enjoined by Christ and the apostles;
that without it all things are empty, with it all are fulfilled.
