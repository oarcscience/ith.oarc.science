<span id="v.iv.vii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—</span>Wherefore, since it is
manifest that the baptism remains in the baptized person when he is
separated from the Church, the baptism which is in him is certainly
separated with him.  And therefore not all who retain the baptism retain
the Church, just as not all who retain the Church retain eternal life. 
Or if we say that only those retain the Church who observe the
commandments of God, we at once concede that there are many who retain
baptism, and do not retain the Church.

<span id="v.iv.vii.xvi-p2"></span>21.  Therefore the heretic is not "the
first to seize baptism," since he has received it from the Church.  Nor,
though he seceded, could baptism have been lost by him whom we assert no
longer to retain the Church, and yet allow to retain baptism.  Nor does
any one "yield his birthright, and give it to a heretic," <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) because he says that he took away
with him what he could not give lawfully, but what would yet be
according to law when given; or that he no longer has lawfully what yet
is in accordance with law in his possession.  But the birthright rests
only in a holy conversation and good life, to which all belong of whom
that bride consists as her members which has no spot or wrinkle, <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) or that dove that groans amid the
wickedness of the many crows,—unless it be that, while Esau lost his
birthright from his lust after a mess of pottage, <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) we are yet to hold that it is
retained by defrauders, robbers, usurers, envious persons, drunkards and
the like, over whose <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> <span
id="v.iv.vii.xvi-Page_471"></span>existence in the Church of his time
Cyprian groaned in his epistles.  Wherefore, either it is not the same
thing to retain the Church and to retain the birthright in divine
things, or, if every one who retains the Church also retains the
birthright, then all those wicked ones do not retain the Church who yet
both seem and are allowed by every one of us to give baptism within the
Church; for no one, save the man who is wholly ignorant of sacred
things, would say that they retain the birthright in sacred things.
