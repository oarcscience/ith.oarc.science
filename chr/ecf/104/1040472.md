<span id="v.v.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—</span>16.  Look at the states
of Musti <span id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946) and Assura: <span
id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947)   there are many still remaining in
this life and in this province who have severed themselves, and many
from whom they have severed themselves; many who have erected an altar,
and many against whom that altar has been erected; many who have
condemned, and many who have been condemned; who have received, and who
have been received; who have been baptized outside, and not baptized
again within:  if all these things in the cause of unity defile, let the
defiled hold their tongues; if these things in the cause of unity do not
defile, let them submit to correction, and terminate their strife.
