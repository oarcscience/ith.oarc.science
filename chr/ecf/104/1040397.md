<span id="v.iv.viii.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—</span>83.  Demetrius of
the Lesser Leptis <span id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744) said:  "We
uphold one baptism, because we claim for the Catholic Church alone what
is her own.  But those who say that heretics baptize truly and lawfully
are themselves the men who make, not two, but many baptisms; for since
heresies are many in number, the baptisms, too, will be reckoned
according to their number." <span id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xliii-p4"></span>84.  To him we answer:  If this
were so, then would as many baptisms be reckoned as there are works of
the flesh, of which the apostle says "that they which do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God;" <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746) among which are reckoned also
heresies; and so many of those very works are tolerated within the
Church as though in the chaff, and yet there is one baptism for them
all, which is not vitiated by any work of unrighteousness.
