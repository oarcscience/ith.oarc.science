<span id="v.v.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—</span>8.  Whilst we bear the
testimony of God to this and the like effect against the vain speaking
of men, we are forced to undergo bitter insults from the enemies of the
glory of Christ.  Let them say what they will, whilst He exhorts us,
saying, "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  Blessed are ye, when men shall
revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against
you falsely for my sake."  What He says in the first instance, "for
righteousness’ sake," He has repeated in the words that He uses
afterwards, "for my sake;" seeing that He "is made unto us wisdom, and
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, that, according as it
is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md)   And when He says, "Rejoice, and
be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven," <span
id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md) if I hold in a good conscience what
is said "for righteousness’ sake," and "for my sake," whosoever
willfully detracts from my reputation is against his will contributing
to my reward.  For neither did He only instruct me by His word, without
also confirming me by His example.  Follow the faith of the holy
Scriptures, and you will find that Christ rose from the dead, ascended
into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of the Father.  Follow the
charges brought by His enemies, and you will presently believe that He
was stolen from the sepulchre by His disciples.  Why then should we,
while defending His house to the best of the abilities given us by God,
expect to meet with any other treatment from His enemies?  "If they have
called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call
them of His household?" <span id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md)   If,
therefore, we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.  But if it be not
only the wrath of the accuser that strikes the ear, but also the truth
of the accusation that stings the conscience, what does it profit me if
the whole world were to exalt me with perpetual praise?  So neither the
eulogy of him who praises has power to heal a guilty conscience, nor
does the insult of him, who reviles wound the good conscience.  Nor,
however, is your hope which is in the Lord deceived, even though we
chance to be in secret what our enemies wish us to be thought; for you
have not placed your hope in us, nor have you ever heard from us any
doctrine of the kind.  You therefore are safe, whatever we may be, who
have learned to say, "I have trusted in the Lord; therefore I shall not
slide;" <span id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md) and "In God have I
put my trust:  I will not be afraid what man can do unto me." <span
id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md)   And to those who endeavor to lead
you astray to the earthly heights of proud men, you know how to answer,
"In the Lord put I my trust:  how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to
your mountain?" <span id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md)
