go on to handle again what Cyprian poured forth with signs of irritation
against Stephen, as it is, moreover, quite unnecessary.  For they are
but the selfsame arguments which have already been sufficiently
discussed; and it is better to pass over those points which involved the
danger of baneful dissension.  But Stephen thought that we should even
hold aloof from those who endeavored to destroy the primitive custom in
the matter of receiving heretics; whereas Cyprian, moved by the
difficulty of the question itself, and being most largely endowed with
the holy bowels of Christian charity, thought that we ought to remain at
unity with those who differed in opinion from ourselves.  Therefore,
although he was not without excitement, though of a truly brotherly
kind, in his indignation, yet the peace of Christ prevailed in their
hearts, that in such a dispute no evil of schism should arise between
them.  But it was not found that "hence grew more abundant heresies and
schisms," <span id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560) because what is of
Christ in them is approved, and what is of themselves is condemned; for
all the more those who hold this law of rebaptizing were cut into
smaller fragments.
