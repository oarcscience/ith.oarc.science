<span id="v.iv.ix.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—</span>42.  Faustus of Timida
Regia <span id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819) said:  "Let not these
persons flatter themselves who favor heretics.  He who interferes with
the baptism of the Church on behalf of heretics makes them Christians,
and us heretics." <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xxii-p4"></span>43.  To him we answer:  If any one
were to say that a man who, when he received baptism had not received
remission of his sins, because he entertained hatred towards his brother
in his heart, was nevertheless not to be baptized again when he
dismissed that hatred from his heart, does such a man interfere with the
baptism of the Church on behalf of murderers, or does he make them
righteous and us murderers?  Let him therefore understand the same also
in the case of heretics.
