<p class="c38"><a name="iv.viii.vi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="iv.viii.vi-p1.1"></A>Chapter 5.&#8212;Against the Title of the Epistle of Manich&aelig;us.</span></p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.vi-p2"></A>6.&#160; Let us see then what Manich&aelig;us teaches me; and particularly let us examine that treatise which he calls the Fundamental Epistle, <A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A> <a name="iv.viii.vi-Page_131"></A>in which almost all that you believe is contained.&#160; For in that unhappy time when we read it we were in your opinion enlightened.&#160; The epistle begins thus:&#8212;"Manich&aelig;us, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the providence of God the Father.&#160; These are wholesome words from the perennial and living fountain."&#160; Now, if you please, patiently give heed to my inquiry.&#160; I do not believe Manich&aelig;us to be an apostle of Christ.&#160; Do not, I beg of you, be enraged and begin to curse.&#160; For you know that it is my rule to believe none of your statements without consideration.&#160; Therefore I ask, who is this Manich&aelig;us?&#160; You will reply, An apostle of Christ.&#160; I do not believe it.&#160; Now you are at a loss what to say or do; for you promised to give knowledge of the truth, and here you are forcing me to believe what I have no knowledge of.&#160; Perhaps you will read the gospel to me, and will attempt to find there a testimony to Manich&aelig;us.&#160; But should you meet with a person not yet believing the gospel, how would you reply to him were he to say, I do not believe?&#160; For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">267</FONT></A>
&#160; So when those on whose authority I have consented to believe in the gospel tell me not to believe in Manich&aelig;us, how can I but consent?&#160; Take your choice.&#160; If you say, Believe the Catholics:&#160; their advice to me is to put no faith in you; so that, believing them, I am precluded from believing you;&#8212;If you say, Do not believe the Catholics:&#160; you cannot fairly use the gospel in bringing me to faith in Manich&aelig;us; for it was at the command of the Catholics that I believed the gospel;&#8212;Again, if you say, You were right in believing the Catholics when they praised the gospel, but wrong in believing their vituperation of Manich&aelig;us:&#160; do you think me such a fool as to believe or not to believe as you like or dislike, without any reason?&#160; It is therefore fairer and safer by far for me, having in one instance put faith in the Catholics, not to go over to you, till, instead of bidding me believe, you make me understand something in the clearest and most open manner.&#160; To convince me, then, you must put aside the gospel.&#160; If you keep to the gospel, I will keep to those who commanded me to believe the gospel; and, in obedience to them, I will not believe you at all.&#160; But if haply you should succeed in finding in the gospel an incontrovertible testimony to the apostleship of Manich&aelig;us, you will weaken my regard for the authority of the Catholics who bid me not to believe you; and the effect of that will be, that I shall no longer be able to believe the gospel either, for it was through the Catholics that I got my faith in it; and so, whatever you bring from the gospel will no longer have any weight with me.&#160; Wherefore, if no clear proof of the apostleship of Manich&aelig;us is found in the gospel, I will believe the Catholics rather than you.&#160; But if you read thence some passage clearly in favor of Manich&aelig;us, I will believe neither them nor you:&#160; not them, for they lied to me about you; nor you, for you quote to me that Scripture which I had believed on the authority of those liars.&#160; But far be it that I should not believe the gospel; for believing it, I find no way of believing you too.&#160; For the names of the apostles, as there recorded,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">268</FONT></A>
 do not include the name of Manich&aelig;us.&#160; And who the successor of Christ&#146;s betrayer was we read in the Acts of the Apostles;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">269</FONT></A>
 which book I must needs believe if I believe the gospel, since both writings alike Catholic authority commends to me.&#160; The same book contains the well-known narrative of the calling and apostleship of Paul.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">270</FONT></A>
&#160; Read me now, if you can, in the gospel where Manich&aelig;us is called an apostle, or in any other book in which I have professed to believe.&#160; Will you read the passage where the Lord promised the Holy Spirit as a Paraclete, to the apostles?&#160; Concerning which passage, behold how many and how great are the things that restrain and deter me from believing in Manich&aelig;us.</p>
