<span id="v.v.iv.c"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.c-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.c-p1.1"></span>Chapter 100.—</span>227.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.c-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But we who are poor in spirit <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268) are not apprehensive for our
wealth, but rather feel a dread of wealth.  We, ‘as having nothing, and
yet possessing all things,’ <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269)
look on our soul as our wealth, and by our punishments and blood
purchase to ourselves the everlasting riches of heaven.  So again the
same Lord says, ‘Whosoever shall lose his substance, shall find it again
an hundred fold.’"

<span id="v.v.iv.c-p4"></span>228.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.c-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  It is not beside
the purpose to inquire into the true meaning of this passage also.  For
where my purpose is not interfered with by any mistake which you make,
or any false impression which you convey in quoting from the Scriptures,
I do not concern myself about the matter.  It is not then written,
"Whosoever shall lose his substance," but "Whosoever shall lose his life
for my sake."  <span id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270)   And the
passage about substance is not, "Whosoever shall lose," but "Every one
that hath forsaken;" <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271) and that
not only with reference to substance of money, but many other things
besides.  But you meanwhile have not lost your substance; but whether
you have forsaken it, in that you so boast of poverty, I cannot say. 
And if by any chance my colleague Fortunatus may know this, being in the
same city with you, he never told me, because I had never asked him. 
However, even if you had done this, you have yet yourself quoted the
testimony of the apostle against yourself in this very epistle which you
have written:  "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and
though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
me nothing." <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272)   For if you had
charity, you would not bring charges against the whole world, which
knows nothing of you, and of which you know no more,—no, not even such
charges as are founded on the proved offenses of the Africans.  If you
had charity, you would not picture to yourself a false unity in your
calumnies, but you would learn to recognize the unity that is most
clearly set forth in the words of the Lord:  "even in the whole
earth." <span id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273)   But if you did not
do this, why do you boast as though you had done it?  Are you really so
filled with fear of riches, that, having nothing, you possess all
things?  Tell that to your colleague Crispinus, who lately bought a farm
near our city of Hippo, that he might there plunge men into the lowest
abyss. <span id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274)   Whence I too know
this all too well.  You perhaps are not aware of it, and therefore shout
out in security, "We stand in fear of riches."  And hence I am surprised
that that cry of yours has been allowed to pass Crispinus, so as to
reach us.  For between Constantina, where you are, and Hippo, where I
am, lies Calama, where he is, nearer indeed to our side, but still
between us.  I wonder, therefore, how it was that he did not first
intercept this cry, and strike it back so that it should not reach to
our ears; and that he did not, in opposition to you, recite in much more
copious phrase a eulogy on riches.  For he not only stands in no fear of
riches, but he actually loves them.  And certainly, before you utter
anything about the rest, you should rehearse such views to him.  If he
makes no corrections, then we have our answer ready.  But for yourself,
if it be true that you are poor, you have with you my brother
Fortunatus.  You will be more likely with such sentiments to please him,
who is my colleague, than Crispinus, who is your own.
