<span id="iv.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—The Supreme Good is that Which is
Possessed of Supreme Existence.</span>

<span id="iv.v.iii-p2"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.v.iii-p2.1"></span>Every</span> one, I suppose, will allow that
the question of things good and evil belongs to moral science, in which
such terms are in common use.  It is therefore to be wished that men
would bring to these inquiries such a clear intellectual perfection as
might enable them to see the chief good, than which nothing is better or
higher, next in order to which comes a rational soul in a state of
purity and perfection.  <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md)   If
this were clearly understood, it would also become evident that the
chief good is that which is properly described as having supreme and
original existence.  For that exists in the highest sense of the word
which continues always the same, which is throughout like itself, which
cannot in any part be corrupted or changed, which is not subject to
time, which admits of no variation in its present as compared with its
former condition.  This is existence in its true sense.  For in this
signification of the word existence there is implied a nature which is
self-contained, and which continues immutably.  Such things can be said
only of God, to whom there is nothing contrary in the strict sense of
the word.  For the contrary of existence is non-existence.  There is
therefore no nature contrary to God.  But since the minds with which we
approach the study of these subjects have their vision damaged and
dulled by silly notions, and by perversity of will, let us try as we can
to gain some little knowledge of this great matter by degrees and with
caution, making our inquiries not like men able to see, but like men
groping the dark.
