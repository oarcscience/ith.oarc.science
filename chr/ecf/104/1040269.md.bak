<span id="v.iv.iv.vii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—</span>10.  Wherefore, then,
have ye severed yourselves?  If there is any sense left in you, you must
surely see that you can find no possible answer to these arguments.  "We
are not left," they say, "so utterly without resource, but that we can
still answer, It is our will.  ‘Who art thou that judgest another man’s
servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth.’" <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md)   They do not understand that this
was said to men who were wishing to judge, not of open facts, but of the
hearts of other men.  For how does the apostle himself come to say so
much about the sins of schisms and heresies?  Or how comes that verse in
the Psalms, "If of a truth ye love justice, judge uprightly, O ye sons
of <span id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.vii-Page_430"></span>men?" <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md)   But why does the Lord Himself
say, "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous
judgment," <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md) if we may not
judge any man?  Lastly, why, in the case of those traditors, whom they
have judged unrighteously, have they themselves ventured to pass any
judgments at all on another man’s servants?  To their own master they
were standing or falling.  Or why, in the case of the recent followers
of Maximianus, have they not hesitated to bring forward the judgment
delivered with the infallible voice, as they aver, of a plenary Council,
in such terms as to compare them with those first schismatics whom the
earth swallowed up alive?  And yet some of them, as they cannot deny,
they either condemned though innocent, or received back again in their
guilt.  But when a truth is urged which they cannot gainsay, they mutter
a truly wholesome murmuring:  "It is our will:  ‘Who art thou that
judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or
falleth.’"  But when a weak sheep is espied in the desert, and the
pastor who should reclaim it to the fold is nowhere to be seen, then
there is setting of teeth, and breaking of the weak neck:  "Thou wouldst
be a good man, wert thou not a traditor.  Consult the welfare of thy
soul; be a Christian."  What unconscionable madness!  When it is said to
a Christian, "Be a Christian," what other lesson is taught, save a
denial that he is a Christian?  Was it not the same lesson which those
persecutors of the Christians wished to teach, by resisting whom the
crown of martyrdom was gained?  Or must we even look on crime as lighter
when committed with threatening of the sword than with treachery of the
tongue?

<span id="v.iv.iv.vii-p5"></span>11.  Answer me this, ye ravening
wolves, who, seeking to be clad in sheep’s clothing, <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) think that the letters of the
blessed Cyprian are in your favor.  Did the sacrilege of schismatics
defile Cyprian, or did it not?  If it did, the Church perished from that
instant, and there remained no source from which ye might spring.  If it
did not, then by what offense on the part of others can the guiltless
possibly be defiled, if the sacrilege of schism cannot defile them? 
Wherefore, then, have ye severed yourselves?  Wherefore, while shunning
the lighter offenses, which are inventions of your own, have ye
committed the heaviest offense of all, the sacrilege of schism?  Will ye
now perchance confess that those men were no longer schismatics or
heretics who had been baptized without the communion of the Church, or
in some heresy or schism, because by coming over to the Church, and
renouncing their former errors, they had ceased to be what formerly they
were?  How then was it, that though they were not baptized, their sins
remained not on their heads?  Was it that the baptism was Christ’s, but
that it could not profit them without the communion of the Church; yet
when they came over, and, renouncing their past error, were received
into the communion of the Church by the laying on of hands, then, being
now rooted and founded in charity, without which all other things are
profitless, they began to receive profit for the remission of sins and
the sanctification of their lives from that sacrament, which, while
without the pale of the Church, they possessed in vain?

<span id="v.iv.iv.vii-p7"></span>12.  Cease, then, to bring forward
against us the authority of Cyprian in favor of repeating baptism, but
cling with us to the example of Cyprian for the preservation of unity. 
For this question of baptism had not been as yet completely worked out,
but yet the Church observed the most wholesome custom of correcting what
was wrong, not repeating what was already given, even in the case of
schismatics and heretics:  she healed the wounded part, but did not
meddle with what was whole.  And this custom, coming, I suppose, from
apostolical tradition (like many other things which are held to have
been handed down under their actual sanction, because they are preserved
throughout the whole Church, though they are not found either in their
letters, or in the Councils of their successors),—this most wholesome
custom, I say, according to the holy Cyprian, began to be what is called
amended by his predecessor Agrippinus. <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md)   But, according to the teaching
which springs from a more careful investigation into the truth, which,
after great doubt and fluctuation, was brought at last to the decision
of a plenary Council, we ought to believe that it rather began to be
corrupted than to receive correction at the hands of Agrippinus. 
Accordingly, when so great a question forced itself upon him, and it was
difficult to decide the point, whether remission of sins and man’s
spiritual regeneration could take place among heretics or schismatics,
and the authority of Agrippinus was there to guide him, with that of
some few men who shared in his misapprehension of this question, having
pre<span id="page_431">p. 431</span> <span
id="v.iv.iv.vii-Page_431"></span>ferred attempting something new to
maintaining a custom which they did not understand how to defend; under
these circumstances considerations of probability forced themselves into
the eyes of his soul, and barred the way to the thorough investigation
of the truth.

council of 70 (disputed date), who were the first to take action in
