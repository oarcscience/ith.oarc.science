<span id="iv.iv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—Of the Authority of the
Scriptures.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xxxi-p2"></span>59.  Attend, then, ye Manichæans, if
perchance there are some of you of whom your superstition has hold so as
to allow you yet to escape.  Attend, I say, without obstinacy, without
the desire to oppose, otherwise your decision will be fatal to
yourselves.  No one can doubt, and you are not so lost to the truth as
not to understand that if it is good, as all allow, to love God and our
neighbor, whatever hangs on these two precepts cannot rightly be
pronounced bad.  What it is that hangs on them it would be absurd to
think of learning from me.  Hear Christ Himself; hear Christ, I say;
hear the Wisdom of God:  "On these two commandments," He says, "hang all
the law and the prophets." <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md)

<span id="iv.iv.xxxi-p4"></span>60.  What can the most shameless
obstinacy say to this?  That these are not Christ’s words?  But they are
written in the Gospel as His words.  That the writing is false?  Is not
this most profane blasphemy?  Is it not most presumptuous to speak
thus?  Is it not most foolhardy?  Is it not most criminal?  The
worshippers of idols, who hate even the name of Christ, never dared to
speak thus against these Scriptures.  For the utter overthrow of all
literature will follow, and there will be an end to all books handed
down from the past, if what is supported by such a strong popular belief
and established by the uniform testimony of so many men and so many
times, is brought into such suspicion, that it is not allowed to have
the credit and the authority of common history.  In fine, what can you
quote from any writings of which I may not speak in this way if it is
quoted against my opinion and my purpose? <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md)

<span id="iv.iv.xxxi-p6"></span>61.  And is it not intolerable that they
forbid us to believe a book widely known and placed now in the hands of
all, while they insist on our believing the book which they quote?  If
any writing is to be suspected, what should be more so than one which
has not merited notoriety, or which may be throughout a forgery, bearing
a false name?  If you force such a writing on me against my will, and
make a display of authority to drive me into belief, shall I, when I
have a writing which I see spread far and wide for a length of time, and
sanctioned by the concordant testimony of churches scattered over all
the world, degrade myself by doubting, and, worse degradation, by
doubting at your suggestion?  Even if you brought forward other
readings, I should not receive them unless supported by general
agreement; and this being the case, do you think that now, when you
bring forward nothing to compare with the text except your own silly and
inconsiderate statement, mankind are so unreasonable and so forsaken by
divine Providence as to prefer to those Scriptures not others quoted by
you in refutation, but merely your own words?  You ought to bring
forward another manuscript with the same contents, but incorrupt and
more correct, with only the passage wanting which you charge with being
spurious.  For example, if you hold that the Epistle of Paul to the
Romans is spurious, you must bring forward another incorrupt, or rather
another manuscript with the same epistle of the same apostle, free from
error and corruption.  You say you will not, lest you be suspected of
corrupting it.  This is your usual reply, and a true one.  Were you to
do this, we should assuredly have this very suspicion; and all men of
any sense would have it too.  See then <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>
<span id="iv.iv.xxxi-Page_58"></span>what you are to think of your own
authority; and consider whether it is right to believe your words
against these Scriptures, when the simple fact that a manuscript is
brought forward by you makes it dangerous to put faith in it.
