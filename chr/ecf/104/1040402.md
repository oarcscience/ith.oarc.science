<span id="v.iv.ix.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—</span>4.  Satius of
Sicilibba <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762.md) said:  "If heretics
receive forgiveness of their sins in their own baptism, it is without
reason that they come to the Church.  For since it is for sins that men
are punished in the day of judgment, heretics have nothing to fear in
the judgment of Christ if they have obtained remission of their
sins." <span id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.iii-p4"></span>5.  This too might also have been our
own judgment; but let its author beware in what spirit it was said.  For
it is expressed in terms of such import, that I should feel no
compunction in consenting and subscribing to it in the same spirit in
which I too believe that heretics may indeed have the baptism of Christ,
but cannot have the remission of their sins.  But he does not say, If
heretics baptize or are baptized, but "If heretics," he says, "receive
forgiveness of their sins in their own baptism, it is without reason
that they come to the Church."  For if we were to set in the place of
heretics those whom Cyprian knew within the Church as "renouncing the
world in words alone and not in deeds," we also might express this same
judgment, in just so many words, with the most perfect truth.  If those
who only seem to be converted receive forgiveness of their sins in their
own baptism, it is without reason that they are afterwards led on to a
true conversion.  For since it is for sins that men are punished in the
day of judgment, "those who renounce the world in words and not in
deeds" have nothing to fear in the judgment of Christ if they have
obtained remission of their sins.  But this reasoning is only made
perfect by some such context as is formed by the addition of the words. 
But they ought to fear the judgment of Christ, and to lose no time in
being converted in the truth of their hearts; and, when they have done
this, it is certainly not necessary that they should be baptized a
second time.  It was possible, therefore, for them to receive baptism,
and either not to receive remission of their sins, or to be burdened
again at once with the load of sins which were forgiven them; and so the
same is the case also with the heretics.
