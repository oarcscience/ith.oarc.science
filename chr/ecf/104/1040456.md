id="v.v.ii-p8.1"></span>A.D.</span>, some say 398 <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.ii-p8.2"></span>A.D.</span>, but Augustin
places it some time after the treatise on Baptism:  *Retractt.* Bk. ii.
xxv.  From the same, we gather the following points as to the origin of
this treatise:  Before A. had finished his books on the Trinity and his
word-for-word commentary on Genesis, a reply to a letter which Petilian
had addressed to his followers, only a small part of which however had
come into A.’s hands, demanded immediate preparation.  This constitutes
Book First.  Subsequently the whole document was obtained, and he was
engaged in preparing the second Book, c. 401; but even before the full
treatise of Petilian had been secured, the latter had obtained A.’s
first book, and afterwards put an epistle abusive of A. in circulation. 
The answer to this latter is Book Third, c. 402.  Petilian was
originally an advocate.  The opponents charged him with having become a
Donatist by compulsion, with assuming the title of Paraclete, and with
endeavoring to prevent all access on their part to his writings.
