<span id="v.iv.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—</span>13.  Therefore Cyprian
writes to Jubaianus as follows, "concerning the baptism of heretics,
who, being placed without, and set down out of the Church," seem to him
to "claim to themselves a matter over which they have neither right nor
power.  Which we," he says, "cannot account valid or lawful, since it is
clear that among them it is unlawful." <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md)   Neither, indeed, do we deny that
a man who is baptized among heretics, or in any schism outside the
Church, derives no profit from it so far as he is partner in the
perverseness of the heretics and schismatics; nor do we hold that those
who baptize, although they confer the real true sacrament of baptism,
are yet acting rightly, in gathering adherents outside the Church, and
entertaining opinions contrary to the Church.  But it is one thing to be
without a sacrament, another thing to be in possession of it wrongly,
and to usurp it unlawfully.  Therefore they do not cease to be
sacraments of Christ and the Church, merely because they are unlawfully
used, not only by heretics, but by all kinds of wicked and impious
persons.  These, indeed, ought to be corrected and punished, but the
sacraments should be acknowledged and revered.

<span id="v.iv.v.x-p3"></span>14.  Cyprian, indeed, says that on this
subject not one, but two or more Councils were held; always, however, in
Africa.  For indeed in one he mentions that seventy-one bishops had been
assembled, <span id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) —to all whose
authority we do not hesitate, with all due deference to Cyprian, to
prefer the authority, supported by many more bishops, of the whole
Church spread throughout the whole world, of which Cyprian himself
rejoiced that he was an inseparable member.

<span id="v.iv.v.x-p5"></span>15.  Nor is the water "profane and
adulterous" <span id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) over which the
name of God is invoked, even though it be invoked by profane and
adulterous persons; because neither the creature itself of water, nor
the name invoked, is adulterous.  But the baptism of Christ, consecrated
by the words of the gospel, is necessarily holy, however polluted and
unclean its ministers may be; because its inherent sanctity cannot be
polluted, and the divine excellence abides in its sacrament, whether to
the salvation of those who use it aright, or to the destruction of those
who use it wrong.  Would you indeed maintain that, while the <span
id="page_440">p. 440</span> <span id="v.iv.v.x-Page_440"></span>light of
the sun or of a candle, diffused through unclean places, contracts no
foulness in itself therefrom, yet the baptism of Christ can be defiled
by the sins of any man, whatsoever he may be?  For if we turn our
thoughts to the visible materials themselves, which are to us the medium
of the sacraments, every one must know that they admit of corruption. 
But if we think on that which they convey to us, who can fail to see
that it is incorruptible, however much the men through whose ministry it
is conveyed are either being rewarded or punished for the character of
their lives?
