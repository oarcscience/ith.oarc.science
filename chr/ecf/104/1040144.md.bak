id="iv.viii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—Exhortation to the Chief
Good.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xliii-p2"></span>48.  Let us, then, not seek in this
beauty for what has not been given to it (and from not having what we
seek for, this is the lowest form of beauty); and in that which has been
given to it, let us praise God, because He has bestowed this great good
of visible form even on the lowest degree of beauty.  And let us not
cleave as lovers to this beauty, but as praisers of God let us rise
above it; and from this superior position let us pronounce judgment on
it, instead of so being bound up in it as to be judged along with it. 
And let us hasten on to that good which has no motion in space or
advancement in time, from which all natures in space and time receive
their sensible being and their form.  To see this good let us purify our
heart by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who says, "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God." <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md)   For the eyes needed in order to see
this good are not those with which we see the light spread through
space, which has part in one place and part in another, instead of being
all in every place.  The sight and the discernment we are to purify is
that by which we see, as far as is allowed in this life, what is just,
what is pious, what is the beauty of wisdom.  He who sees these things,
values them far above the fullness of all regions in space, and finds
that the vision of these things requires not the extension of his
perception through distances in space, but its invigoration by an
immaterial influence. <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md)
