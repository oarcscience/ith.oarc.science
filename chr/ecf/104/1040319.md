<span id="v.iv.vi.xxi"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—</span>29.  With regard to the
objection brought against Cyprian, that the catechumens who were seized
in martyrdom, and slain for Christ’s name’s sake, received a crown even
without baptism, I do not quite see what it has to do with the matter,
unless, <span id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xxi-Page_460"></span>indeed, they urged that heretics could
much more be admitted with baptism to Christ’s kingdom, to which
catechumens were admitted without it, since He Himself has said, "Except
a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God." <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md)   Now, in
this matter I do not hesitate for a moment to place the Catholic
catechumen, who is burning with love for God, before the baptized
heretic; nor yet do we thereby do dishonor to the sacrament of baptism
which the latter has already received, the former not as yet; nor do we
consider that the sacrament of the catechumen <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) is to be preferred to the sacrament
of baptism, when we acknowledge that some catechumens are better and
more faithful than some baptized persons.  For the centurion Cornelius,
before baptism, was better than Simon, who had been baptized.  For
Cornelius, even before his baptism, was filled with the Holy
Spirit; <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) Simon, even after
baptism, was puffed up with an unclean spirit. <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md)   Cornelius, however, would have
been convicted of contempt for so holy a sacrament, if, even after he
had received the Holy Ghost, he had refused to be baptized.  But when he
was baptized, he received in no wise a better sacrament than Simon; but
the different merits of the men were made manifest under the equal
holiness of the same sacrament—so true is it that the good or ill
deserving of the recipient does not increase or diminish the holiness of
baptism.  But as baptism is wanting to a good catechumen to his
receiving the kingdom of heaven, so true conversion is wanting to a bad
man though baptized.  For He who said, "Except a man be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God," said also
Himself, "except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of
the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
heaven." <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md)   For that the
righteousness of the catechumens might not feel secure, it is written,
"Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter
into the kingdom of God."  And again, that the unrighteousness of the
baptized might not feel secure because they had received baptism, it is
written, "Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of
the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
heaven."  The one were too little without the other; the two make
perfect the heir of that inheritance.  As, then, we ought not to
depreciate a man’s righteousness, which begins to exist before he is
joined to the Church, as the righteousness of Cornelius began to exist
before he was in the body of Christian men,—which righteousness was not
thought worthless, or the angel would not have said to him, "Thy prayers
and thine alms are come up as a memorial before God;" nor did it yet
suffice for his obtaining the kingdom of heaven, or he would not have
been told to send to Peter, <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md)
—so neither ought we to depreciate the sacrament of baptism, even though
it has been received outside the Church.  But since it is of no avail
for salvation unless he who has baptism indeed in full perfection be
incorporated into the Church, correcting also his own depravity, let us
therefore correct the error of the heretics, that we may recognize what
in them is not their own but Christ’s.

<span id="v.iv.vi.xxi-p3"></span> Another reading, of less authority,
is, *"Aut catechumeno sacramentum baptismi præferendum putamus."*  This
does not suit the sense of the passage, and probably sprung from want of
knowledge of the meaning of the "catechumen’s sacrament."  It is
mentioned in the Council of Carthage, <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xxi-p3.1"></span>A.D.</span> 397, as "the sacrament of salt"
(cap. 5).  Augustin (*de Peccat. Meritis*, ii. c. 26), says that "what
the catechumens receive, though it be not the body of Christ, yet is
holy, more holy than the food whereby our bodies are sustained, because
it is a sacrament."—Cp. *de Catech. Rudibus*, c. 26 \[Bened.\].  It
appears to have been only a taste of salt, given them as the emblem of
purity and incorruption.  See Bingham, *Orig. Eccles*. Book x. c. ii.
16.
