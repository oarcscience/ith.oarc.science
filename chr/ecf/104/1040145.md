hindered by those fancies which are originated by the carnal sense, and
are retained and modified by the imagination, let us abhor this heresy
which has been led by faith in its fancies to represent the divine
substance as extended and diffused through space, even through infinite
space, and to cut short one side so as to make room for evil,—not being
able to perceive that evil is not nature, but against nature; and to
beautify this very evil with such visible appearance, and forms, and
consistency of parts prevailing in its several natures, not being able
to conceive of any nature without those good things, that the evils
found fault with in it are buried under a countless abundance of good
things.
