id="iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—He Begins with Arguments, in
Compliance with the Mistaken Method of the Manichæans.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>3.  Where, then, shall I begin?  With
authority, or with reasoning?  In the order of nature, when we learn
anything, authority precedes reasoning.  For a reason may seem weak,
when, after it is given, it requires authority to confirm it.  But
because the minds of men are obscured by familiarity with darkness,
which covers them in the night of sins and evil habits, and cannot
perceive in a way suitable to the clearness and purity of reason, there
is most wholesome provision for bringing the dazzled eye into the light
of truth under the congenial shade of authority.  But since we have to
do with people who are perverse in all their thoughts and words and
actions, and who insist on nothing more than on beginning with argument,
I will, as a concession to them, take what I think a wrong method in
discussion.  For I like to imitate, as far as I can, the gentleness of
my Lord Jesus Christ, who took on Himself the evil of death itself,
wishing to free us from it.
