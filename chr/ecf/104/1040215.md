<span id="iv.x.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.x.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—To Punish and to Forgive Sins
Belong Equally to God.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xxxiii-p2"></span>Likewise because it belongs to divine
judgment, not human, what sort of punishment and how great is due to
every fault, it is thus written:  "O the height of the riches of the
wisdom and the knowledge of God! how inscrutable are His judgments and
his ways past finding out!" <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md)  
Likewise because by the goodness of God sins are forgiven to the
converted, the very fact that Christ was sent sufficiently shows, who
not in His own nature as God, but in our nature, which He assumed from a
woman, died for us; which goodness of God with reference to us, and
which love of God, the apostle thus sets forth:  "But God commendeth His
love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us;
much more now being justified in His blood we shall be saved from wrath
through Him.  For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to <span
id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span id="iv.x.xxxiii-Page_358"></span>God
through the death of His Son, much more being reconciled we shall be
saved in His life." <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md)   But
because even when due punishment is rendered to sinners, there is no
unrighteousness on God’s part, he thus says:  "What shall we say?  Is
God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath?" <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md)   But in one place he has briefly
admonished that goodness and severity are alike from Him, saying:  "Thou
seest then the goodness and severity of God; toward them that have
fallen, severity, but towards thee goodness, if thou shouldst continue
in goodness." <span id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md)
