More Gently Dealt with.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.iii-p2"></span>2.  Let those rage against you who know
not with what labor the truth is to be found and with what difficulty
error is to be avoided.  Let those rage against you who know not how
rare and hard it is to overcome the fancies of the flesh by the serenity
of a pious disposition.  Let those rage against you who know not the
difficulty of curing the eye of the inner man that he may gaze upon his
Sun,—not that sun <span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span
id="iv.viii.iii-Page_130"></span>which you worship, and which shines
with the brilliance of a heavenly body in the eyes of carnal men and of
beasts,—but that of which it is written through the prophet, "The Sun of
righteousness has arisen upon me;" <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264) and of which it is said in the gospel,
"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the
world." <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265)   Let those rage against
you who know not with what sighs and groans the least particle of the
knowledge of God is obtained.  And, last of all, let those rage against
you who have never been led astray in the same way that they see that
you are.
