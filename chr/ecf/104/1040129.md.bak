<span id="iv.viii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.viii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—The Beauty of the Straight
Line Might Be Taken from the Region of Darkness Without Taking Anything
from Its Substance.  So Evil Neither Takes from Nor Adds to the
Substance of the Soul.  The Straightness of Its Side Would Be So Far a
Good Bestowed on the Region of Darkness by God the Creator.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xxviii-p2"></span>29.  What is to be done with unhappy
minds, perverse in error, and held fast by custom?  These men do not
know what they say when they say those things; for they do not
consider.  Listen to me; no one forces you, no one quarrels with you, no
one taunts you with past errors, unless some one who has not experienced
the divine mercy in deliverance from error:  all we desire is that the
errors should some time or other be abandoned.  Think a little without
animosity or bitterness.  We are all human beings:  let us hate, not one
another, but errors and lies.  Think a little, I pray you.  God of
mercy, help them to think, and kindle in the minds of inquirers the true
light.  If anything is plain, is not this, that right is better than
wrong?  Give me, then, a calm and quiet answer to this, whether making
crooked the right line of the region of darkness which joins on to the
right line of the region of light, would not detract from its beauty. 
If you will not be dogged, you must confess that not only is beauty
taken from it by its being made crooked, but also the beauty which it
might have had from connection with the right line of the region of
light.  Is it the case, then, that in this loss of beauty, in which
right is made crooked, and harmony becomes discord, and agreement
disagreement, there is any loss of substance?  Learn, then, from this
that substance is not evil; but as in the body, by change of form for
the worse, beauty is lost, or rather lessened, and what was called fair
before is said to be ugly, and what was pleasing becomes displeasing, so
in the mind the seemliness of a right will, which makes a just and pious
life, is injured when the will changes for the worse; and by this sin
the mind becomes miserable, instead of enjoying as before the happiness
which comes from the ornament of a right will, without any gain or loss
of substance.

<span id="iv.viii.xxviii-p3"></span>30.  Consider, again, that though we
admit that the border of the region of darkness was evil for other
reasons, such as that it was dim and dark, or any other reason, still it
was not evil in being straight.  So, if I admit that there was some evil
in its color, you must admit that there was some good in its
straightness.  Whatever the amount of this good, it is not allowable to
attribute it to any other than God the Maker, from whom we must believe
that all good in whatsoever nature comes, if we are to escape deadly
error.  It is absurd, then, to say that this region is perfect evil,
when in its straightness of border is found the good of not a little
beauty of a material kind; and also to make this region to be altogether
estranged, from the almighty and good God, when this good which we find
in it can be attributed to no other but the author of all good things. 
But this border, too, we are told, was evil.  Well, suppose it evil:  it
would surely have been worse had it been crooked instead of straight. 
And how can that be the perfection of evil than which something worse
than itself can be thought of?  And to be worse implies that there is
some good, the want of which makes the thing worse.  Here the want of
straightness would make the line worse.  Therefore its straightness is
something good.  And you will never answer the question whence this
goodness comes, without reference to Him from whom we must acknowledge
that all good things come, whether small or great.  But now we shall
pass on from considering this border to something else.
