<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 85.—</span>185.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxxxv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"For the Lord Christ says, ‘No man can come to me, except the Father
which hath sent me draw him.’ <span id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200)
  But why do we not permit each several person to follow his free will,
since the Lord God Himself has given free will to men, showing to them,
however, the way of righteousness, lest any one by chance should perish
from ignorance of it?  For He said, ‘I have placed before thee good and
evil.  I have set fire and water before thee; choose which thou wilt.’ 
From which choice, you wretched men, you have chosen for yourselves not
water, but rather fire.  ‘But yet,’ He says, ‘choose the good, that thou
mayest live.’ <span id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201)   <span
id="page_574">p. 574</span> <span id="v.v.iv.lxxxv-Page_574"></span>You
who will not choose the good, have, by your own sentence, declared that
you do not wish to live."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxv-p4"></span>186.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxxv-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  If I were to
propose to you the question how God the Father draws men to the Son,
when He has left them to themselves in freedom of action, you would
perhaps find it difficult of solution.  For how does He draw them to Him
if He leaves them to themselves, so that each should choose what he
pleases?  And yet both these facts are true; but this is a truth which
few have intellect enough to penetrate.  As therefore it is possible
that, after leaving men to themselves in free will, the Father should
yet draw them to the Son, so is it also possible that those warnings
which are given by the correction of the laws do not take away free
will.  For whenever a man suffers anything that is harsh and unpleasing,
he is warned to consider why it is that he is suffering, so that, if he
shall discover that he is suffering in the cause of justice, he may
choose the good that consists in the very act of suffering as he does in
the cause of justice; but if he sees that it is unrighteousness for
which he suffers, he may be induced, from the consideration that he is
suffering and being tormented most fruitlessly, to change his purpose
for the better, and may at the same time escape both the fruitless
annoyance and the unrighteousness itself, which is likely to prove yet
more hurtful and pernicious in the mischief it produces.  And so you,
when kings make any enactments against you, should consider that you are
receiving a warning to consider why this is being done to you.  For if
it is for righteousness’ sake, then are they truly your persecutors; but
you are the blessed ones, who, being persecuted for righteousness’ sake,
shall inherit the kingdom of heaven: <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202)   but if it is because of the
iniquity of your schism, what are they more than your correctors; while
you, like all the others who are guilty of various crimes, and pay the
penalty appointed by the law, are undoubtedly unhappy both in this world
and in that which is to come?  No one, therefore, takes away from you
your free will.  But I would urge you diligently to consider which you
would rather choose,—whether to live corrected in peace, or, by
persevering in malice, to undergo real punishment under the false name
of martyrdom.  But I am addressing you just as though you were suffering
something proportionate to your sin, whereas you are committing sins of
such enormity and reigning in such impunity.  You are so furious, that
you cause more terror than a war trumpet with your cry of "*Praise to
God;*" so full of calumny, that even when you throw yourselves over
precipices without any provocation, you impute it to our persecutions.

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxxv-p6"></span>187.  He says also, like the kindest
of teachers,  "You who will not choose the good, have, by your own
sentence, declared that you do not wish to live."  According to this, if
we were to believe your accusations, we should live in kindness; but
because we believe the promises of God, we declare by our own sentence
that we do not wish to live.  You remember well, it seems to me, what
the apostles answered to the Jews when they were desired to abstain from
preaching Christ.  This therefore we also say, that you should answer us
whether we ought rather to obey God or man. <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203)   *Traditors,* offerers of incense,
persecutors:  these are the words of men against men.  Christ remained
only in the love of Donatus:  these are the words of men extolling the
glory of a man under the name of Christ, that the glory of Christ
Himself may be diminished.  For it is written, "In the multitude of
people is the king’s honor: but in the want of people is the destruction
of the prince:" <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204)   these,
therefore, are the words of men.  But those words in the gospel, "It
behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and
that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name
among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem," <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205) are the words of Christ, showing
forth the glory which He received from His Father in the wideness of His
kingdom.  When we have heard them both, we choose in preference the
communion of the Church, and prefer the words of Christ to the words of
men.  I ask, who is there that can say that we have chosen what is evil,
except one who shall say that Christ taught what was evil?
