<span id="v.iv.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—</span>12.  Likewise Honoratus of
Tucca <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) said:  "Since Christ is
the Truth, we ought to follow truth rather than custom." <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md)   By all these declarations it is
proved that we are not excluded from the communion of the Church, till
it shall have been clearly shown what is the nature of the truth, which
they say must be preferred to our custom.  But if the truth has made it
clear that the very regulation ought to be maintained which the said
custom had prescribed, then it is evident both that this custom was not
established or confirmed in vain, and also that, in consequence of the
discussions in question, the most wholesome observance of so great a
sacrament, which could never, indeed, have been changed in the Catholic
Church, was even more watchfully guarded with the most scrupulous
caution, when it had received the further corroboration of Councils.
