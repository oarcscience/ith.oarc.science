<span id="v.v.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—</span>68.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxx-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"Or if any one chance to recollect the chants of a priest, is he
therefore to be deemed a priest, because with sacrilegious mouth he
publishes the strain of a priest?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xxx-p2"></span>69.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxx-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  In this question
you are speaking just as though we were at <span id="page_547">p.
547</span> <span id="v.v.iv.xxx-Page_547"></span>present inquiring what
constituted a true priest, not what constituted true baptism.  For that
a man should be a true priest, it is requisite that he should be clothed
not with the sacrament alone, but with righteousness, as it is written,
"Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness." <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md)   But if a man be a priest in
virtue of the sacrament alone, as was the high priest Caiaphas, the
persecutor of the one most true Priest, then even though he himself be
not truthful, yet what he gives is true, if he gives not what is his own
but what is God’s; as it is said of Caiaphas himself, "This spake he not
of himself:  but being high priest that year, he prophesied." <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md)   And yet, to use the same simile
which you employed yourself:  if you were to hear even from any one that
was profane the prayer of the priest couched in the words suitable to
the mysteries of the gospel, can you possibly say to him, Your prayer is
not true, though he himself may be not only no true priest, but not a
priest at all? seeing that the Apostle Paul said that certain testimony
of I know not what Cretan prophet was true, though he was not reckoned
among the prophets of God for he says, "One of themselves, even a
prophet of their own, said the Cretians are always liars, evil beasts,
slow bellies:  this witness is true." <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md)   If, therefore, the apostle even
himself bore witness to the testimony of some obscure prophet of a
foreign race, because he found it to be true, why do not we, when we
find in any one what belongs to Christ, and is true even though the man
with whom it may be found be deceitful and perverse, why do not we in
such a case make a distinction between the fault which is found in the
man, and the truth which he has not of his own but of God’s? and why do
we not say, This sacrament is true, as Paul said, "This witness is
true"?  Does it at all follow that we say, The man himself also is
truthful, because we say, This sacrament is true?  Just as I would ask
whether the apostle counted that prophet among the prophets of the Lord,
because he confirmed the truth of what he found to be true in him. 
Likewise the same apostle, when he was at Athens, perceived a certain
altar among the altars of the false gods, on which was this inscription,
"To the unknown God."  And this testimony he made use of to build them
up in Christ, to the extent of quoting the inscription in his sermon,
and adding, "Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto
you."  Did he, because he found that altar among the altars of idols, or
set up by sacrilegious hands, therefore condemn or reject what he found
in it that was true? or did he, because of the truth which he found upon
it, therefore persuade them that they ought also to follow the
sacrilegious practices of the pagans?  Surely he did neither of the two;
but presently, when, as he judged fitting, he wished to introduce to
their knowledge the Lord Himself unknown to them, but known to him, he
says among other things, that "He is not far from every one of us:  for
in Him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your
own poets have said." <span id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md)   Can
it be said that here also, because he found among the sacrilegious, the
evidence of truth, he either approved their wickedness because of the
evidence, or condemned the evidence because of their wickedness?  But it
is unavoidable that you should be always in the wrong, so long as you do
despite to the sacraments of God because of the faults of men, or think
that we take upon ourselves the sacrilege even of your schism, for the
sake of the sacraments of God, to which we are unwilling to do despite
in you.
