<span id="v.v.v.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—</span>39.  Petilianus quotes
also the warning of the Apostle John, that we should not believe every
spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, <span
id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) as though this care should be
bestowed in order that the wheat should be separated from the chaff in
<span id="page_613">p. 613</span> <span
id="v.v.v.xxxiv-Page_613"></span>this present world before its time, and
not rather for fear that the wheat should be deceived by the chaff; or
as though, even if the lying spirit should have said something that was
true, it was to be denied, because the spirit whom we should abominate
had said it.  But if any one thinks this, he is mad enough to contend
that Peter ought not to have said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living God," <span id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396.md) because the
devils had already said something to the same effect. <span
id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md)   Seeing, therefore, that the
baptism of Christ, whether administered by an unrighteous or a righteous
man, is nothing but the baptism of Christ what a cautious man and
faithful Christian should do is to avoid the unrighteousness of man, not
to condemn the sacraments of God.

<span id="v.v.v.xxxiv-p5"></span>40.  Assuredly in all these things
Petilianus gives no answer to the question, If the conscience of one
that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of
the recipient, by what means is he to be cleansed who receives baptism,
when the conscience of the giver is polluted without the knowledge of
the proposed recipient?  A certain Cyprian, a colleague of his from
Thubursicubur, was caught in a brothel with a woman of most abandoned
character, and was brought before Primianus of Carthage, and condemned. 
Now, when this man baptized before he was detected and condemned, it is
manifest that he had not the conscience of one that gives in holiness,
so as to cleanse the conscience of the recipient.  By what means then
have they been cleansed who at this day, after he has been condemned,
are certainly not washed again?  It was not necessary to name the man
save only to prevent Petilianus from repeating, "Who is the man, and
from what corner has he started up, that you propose to us?"  Why did
not your party examine that baptizer, as John, in the opinion of
Petilianus, was examined?  Or was the real fact this, that they examined
him so far as man can examine man, but were unable to find him out, as
he long lay hid with cunning falseness?
