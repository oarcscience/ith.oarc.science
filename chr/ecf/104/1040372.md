<span id="v.iv.viii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—</span>30.  Secundinus of
Cedias <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) said:  "Since our Lord
Christ said, ‘He that is not with me is against me,’ <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) and the Apostle John declares those
who go out from the Church to be antichrists, <span
id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) without all doubt the enemies of
Christ, and those who are called antichrists, cannot minister the grace
of the baptism which gives salvation; and therefore my judgment is that
those who take refuge in the Church from the snares of heresy should be
baptized by us, who of His condescension are called the friends of
God." <span id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xviii-p6"></span>31.  The answer to which is, That
all are the opponents of Christ, to whom, on their saying, "Lord, have
we not in Thy name done many wonderful things?" with all the rest that
is there recorded, He shall at the last day answer, "I never knew you: 
depart from me, ye that work iniquity," <span
id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) —all which kind of chaff is
destined for the fire, if it persevere to the last in its wickedness,
whether any part of it fly outside before its winnowing, or whether it
seem to be within.  If, therefore, those heretics who come to the Church
are to be again baptized, that they may be baptized by the friends of
God, are those covetous men, those robbers, murderers, the friends of
God, or must those whom they have baptized be baptized afresh?

<span id="v.iv.viii.xviii-p2"></span> Cedias (Cedia) has been
identified, but without sufficient reason, with Quidias, or Quiza, in
Mauritania Cæsariensis for both places have bishops at the Collation of
411.  A Bp. Secundinus is mentioned in Cypr. Epp. lvii., lxvii., but
whether these refer to him of Cedias or him of Carpos (ch. 31) cannot be
decided.
