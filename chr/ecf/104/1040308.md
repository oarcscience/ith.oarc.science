<span id="v.iv.vi.x"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—</span>15.  But some one may say
that the tares within may more easily be converted into wheat.  I grant
that it is so; but what has this to do with the question of repeating
baptism?  You surely do not maintain that if a man converted from
heresy, through the occasion and opportunity given by his conversion,
should bear fruit before another who, being within the Church, is more
slow to be washed from his iniquity, and so corrected and changed, the
former therefore needs not to be baptized again, but the churchman to be
baptized again, who was outstripped by him who came from the heretics,
because of the greater slowness of his amendment.  It has nothing,
therefore, to do with the question now at issue who is later or slower
in being converted from his especial waywardness to the straight path of
faith, or hope, or charity.  For although the bad within the fold are
more easily made good yet it will sometimes happen that certain of the
number of those outside will outstrip in their conversion certain of
those within; and while these remain in barrenness, the former, being
restored to unity and communion, will bear fruit with patience,
thirty-fold, or sixty-fold, or a hundred-fold. <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md)   Or if those only are to be called
tares who remain in perverse error to the end, there are many ears of
corn outside, and many tares within.

<span id="v.iv.vi.x-p3"></span>16.  But it will be urged that the bad
outside are worse than those within.  It is indeed a weighty question,
whether Nicolaus, being already severed from the Church, <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md) or Simon, who was still within
it, <span id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md) was the worse,—the one
being a heretic, the other a sorcerer.  But if the mere fact of
division, as being the clearest token of violated charity, is held to be
the worse evil, I grant that it is so.  Yet many, though they have lost
all feelings of charity, yet do not secede from considerations of
worldly profit; and as they seek their own, not the things which are
Jesus Christ’s, <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) what they are
unwilling to secede from is not the unity of Christ, but their own
temporal advantage.  Whence it is said in praise of charity, that she
"seeketh not her own." <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md)

<span id="v.iv.vi.x-p8"></span>17.  Now, therefore, the question is, how
could men of the party of the devil belong to the Church, which has no
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) of which also it is said, "My dove
is one?" <span id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md)   But if they
cannot, it is clear that she groans among those who are not of her, some
treacherously laying wait within, some barking at her gate without. 
Such men, however, even within, both receive baptism, and possess it,
and transmit it holy in itself; nor is it in any way defiled by their
wickedness, in which they persevere even to the end.  Wherefore the same
blessed Cyprian teaches us that baptism is to be considered as
consecrated in itself by the words of the gospel, as the Church has
received, without joining to it or mingling with it any consideration of
waywardness and wickedness on the part of either minister or recipients;
since he himself points out to us both truths,—both that there have been
some within the Church who did not cherish kindly Christian love, but
practised envy and unkind dissension, of whom the Apostle Paul spoke;
and also that the envious belong to the devil’s party, as he testifies
in the most open way in the epistle which he wrote about envy and
malignity.  Wherefore, since it is clearly possible that in those who
belong to the devil’s party, Christ’s sacrament may yet be holy,—not,
indeed, to their salvation, but to their condemnation, and that not only
if they are led astray after they have been baptized, but even if they
were such in heart when they received the sacrament, renouncing the
world (as the same <span id="page_454">p. 454</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.x-Page_454"></span>Cyprian shows) in words only and not in
deeds;  <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) and since even if
afterwards they be brought into the right way, the sacrament is not to
be again administered which they received when they were astray; so far
as I can see, the case is already clear and evident, that in the
question of baptism we have to consider, not who gives, but what he
gives; not who receives, but what he receives; not who has, but what he
has.  For if men of the party of the devil, and therefore in no way
belonging to the one dove, can yet receive, and have, and give baptism
in all its holiness, in no way defiled by their waywardness, as we are
taught by the letters of Cyprian himself, how are we ascribing to
heretics what does not belong to them? how are we saying that what is
really Christ’s is theirs, and not rather recognizing in them the signs
of our Sovereign, and correcting the deeds of deserters from Him? 
Wherefore it is one thing, as the holy Cyprian says, "for those within
in the Church, to speak in the name of Christ, another thing for those
without, who are acting against the Church, to baptize in His
name." <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md)   But both many who
are within act against the Church by evil living, and by enticing weak
souls to copy their lives; and some who are without speak in Christ’s
name, and are not forbidden to work the works of Christ, but only to be
without, since for the healing of their souls we grasp at them, or
reason with them, or exhort them.  For he, too, was without who did not
follow Christ with His disciples, and yet in Christ’s name was casting
out devils, which the Lord enjoined that he should not be prevented from
doing; <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) although, certainly,
in the point where he was imperfect he was to be made whole, in
accordance with the words of the Lord, in which He says, "He that is not
with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad." <span id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md)   Therefore both
some things are done outside in the name of Christ not against the
Church, and some things are done inside on the devil’s part which are
against the Church.
