<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—</span>70.  Peter of Hippo
Diarrhytus <span id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) said:  "Since
there is one baptism in the Catholic Church, it is clear that a man
cannot be baptized outside the Church; and therefore I give my judgment,
that those who have been bathed in heresy or in schism ought to be
baptized on coming to the Church." <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxvi-p4"></span>71.  There is one baptism in the
Catholic Church, in such a sense that, when any have gone out from it,
it does not become two in those who go out, but remains one and the
same.  What, therefore, is recognized in those who return, should also
be recognized in those who received it from men who have separated
themselves, since they did not lose it when they went apart into heresy.
