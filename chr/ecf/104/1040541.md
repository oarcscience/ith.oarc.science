id="v.v.iv.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 54.—</span>123.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.liv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But if it should so happen, though whether it be so I cannot say, that
you cast out devils, neither will this in you do any good; because the
devils themselves yield neither to your faith nor to your merits, but
are driven out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."

<span id="v.v.iv.liv-p2"></span>124.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.liv-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  God be thanked
that you have at length confessed that the invocation of the name of
Christ may be of profit for the salvation of others, even though it be
invoked by sinners!  Hence, therefore, you may understand that when the
name of Christ is invoked, the sins of one man do not stand in the way
of the salvation of another.  But to determine in what manner we invoke
the name of Christ, we require not your judgment, but the judgment of
Christ Himself who is invoked by us; for He alone can know in what
spirit He is invoked.  Yet from His own words we are assured that He is
invoked to their salvation by all nations, who are blessed in the seed
of Abraham.
