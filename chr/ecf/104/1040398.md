<span id="v.iv.viii.xliv"></span>

<span id="v.iv.viii.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—</span>85.  Vincentius of
Thibari <span id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747) said:  "We know that
heretics are worse than heathens.  If they, being converted, wish to
come to God, they have assuredly a rule of truth, which the Lord by His
divine precept committed to the apostles, saying, ‘Go ye, lay on hands
in my name, cast out devils;’ <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748)
and in another place, ‘Go ye, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.’ <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749)   Therefore, first by the laying on
of hands in exorcism, secondly by regeneration in baptism, they may come
to the promises of Christ; but my judgment is that in no other way
should this be done." <span id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xliv-p6"></span>86.  By what rule he asserts that
heretics are worse than heathens I do not know, seeing that the Lord
says, "If he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a
heathen man and a publican." <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751)
  Is a heretic worse even than such?  I do not gainsay it.  I do not,
however, allow that because the man himself is worse than a heathen,
that is, than a Gentile and pagan, therefore whatever the sacrament
contains that is Christ’s is mingled with his vices and character, and
perishes through the corruption of such admixture.  For if even those
who depart from the Church, and become not the followers but the
founders of heresies, have been baptized before their secession, they
continue to have baptism, although, according to the above rule, they
are worse than heathens; for if on correction they return, they do not
receive it, as they certainly would do if they had lost it.  It is
therefore possible that a man may be worse than a heathen, and yet that
the sacrament of Christ <span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xliv-Page_498"></span>may not only be in him, but be not a
whit inferior to what it is in a holy and righteous man.  For although
to the extent of his powers he has not preserved the sacrament, but done
it violence in heart and will, yet so far as the sacrament’s own nature
is concerned, it has remained unhurt in its integrity even in the man
who despised and rejected it.  Were not the people of Sodom heathens,
that is to say, Gentiles?  The Jews therefore were worse, to whom the
Lord says, "It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day
of judgment than for thee;" <span id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752)
and to whom the prophet says, "Thou hast justified Sodom," <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753) that is to say, in comparison with
thee Sodom is righteous.  Shall we, however, maintain that on this
account the holy sacraments which existed among the Jews partook of the
nature of the Jews themselves,—those sacraments which the Lord Himself
also accepted, and sent the lepers whom He had cleansed to fulfill
them, <span id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754) of which when Zacharias
was administering them, the angel stood by him, and declared that his
prayer had been heard while he was sacrificing in the temple? <span
id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755)   These same sacraments were both
in the good men of that time, and in those bad men who were worse than
are the heathens, seeing that they were ranked before the Sodomites for
wickedness, and yet those sacraments were perfect and holy in both.

<span id="v.iv.viii.xliv-p12"></span>87.  For even if the Gentiles
themselves could have anything holy and right in their doctrines, our
saints did not condemn it, however much the Gentiles themselves were to
be detested for their superstitions and idolatry and pride, and the rest
of their corruptions, and to be punished with judgment from heaven
unless they submitted to correction.  For when Paul the apostle also was
saying something concerning God before the Athenians, he adduced as a
proof of what he said, that certain of them had said something to the
same effect, <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756) which certainly
would not be condemned but recognized in them if they should come to
Christ.  And the holy Cyprian uses similar evidence against the same
heathens; for, speaking of the magi, he says, "The chief of them,
however, Hostanes, asserts both that the form of the true God cannot be
seen, and also that true angels stand beside His seat.  In which Plato
also agrees in like manner, and, maintaining the existence of one God,
he calls the others angels or demons.  Hermes Trismegistus also speaks
of one God, and confesses that He is incomprehensible, and past our
powers of estimation." <span id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757)   If,
therefore, they were to come to the perception of salvation in Christ,
it surely would not be said to them, This that ye have is bad, or false;
but clearly it would deservedly be said, Though this in you is perfect
and true, yet it would profit nothing unless ye came to the grace of
Christ.  If, therefore, anything that is holy can be found and rightly
approved in the very heathens, although the salvation which is of Christ
is not yet to be granted to them, we ought not, even though heretics are
worse than they, to be moved to the desire of correcting what is bad in
them belonging to themselves, without being willing to acknowledge what
is good in them of Christ.  But we will set forth from a fresh preface
to consider the remaining judgments of this Council.
