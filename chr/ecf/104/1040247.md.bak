<span id="v.iv.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>6.  I prefer, he says, to
receive Christ’s baptism where both parties agree that it exists.  But
those whom you intend to join say that it cannot be received there
rightly; and those who say that it can be received there rightly are the
party whom you mean to quit.  What they say, therefore, whom you
yourself consider of inferior authority, in opposition to what those say
whom you yourself prefer, is, if not false, at any rate, to use a milder
term, at least uncertain.  I entreat you, therefore, to prefer what is
true to what is false, or what is certain to what is uncertain.  For it
is not only those whom <span id="page_415">p. 415</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii.v-Page_415"></span>you are going to join, but you yourself
who are going to join them, that confess that what you want can be
rightly received in that body which you mean to join when you have
received it elsewhere.  For if you had any doubts whether it could be
rightly received there, you would also have doubts whether you ought to
make the change.  If, therefore, it is doubtful whether it be not sin to
receive baptism from the party of Donatus, who can doubt but that it is
certain sin not to prefer receiving it where it is certain that it is
not sin?  And those who are baptized there through ignorance, thinking
that it is the true Church of Christ, are guilty of less sin in
comparison than these, though even they are wounded by the impiety of
schism; nor do they escape a grievous hurt, because others suffer even
more.  For when it is said to certain men, "It shall be more tolerable
for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you," <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md) it is not meant that the men of
Sodom shall escape torment, but only that the others shall be even more
grievously tormented.

<span id="v.iv.iii.v-p3"></span>7.  And yet this point had once,
perhaps, been involved in obscurity and doubt.  But that which is a
source of health to those who give heed and receive correction, is but
an aggravation of the sin of those who, when they are no longer suffered
to be ignorant, persist in their madness to their own destruction.  For
the condemnation of the party of Maximianus, and their restoration after
they had been condemned, together with those whom they had
sacrilegiously, to use the language of their own Council, <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md) baptized in schism, settles the
whole question in dispute, and removes all controversy.  There is no
point at issue between ourselves and those Donatists who hold communion
with Primianus, which could give rise to any doubt that the baptism of
Christ may not only be retained, but even conferred by those who are
severed from the Church.  For as they themselves are obliged to confess
that those whom Felicianus baptized in schism received true baptism,
inasmuch as they now acknowledge them as members of their own body, with
no other baptism than that which they received in schism; so we say that
that is Christ’s baptism, even without the pale of Catholic communion,
which they confer who are cut off from that communion, inasmuch as they
had not lost it when they were cut off.  And what they themselves think
that they conferred on those persons whom Felicianus baptized in schism,
when they admitted them to reconcilation with themselves, viz., not that
they should receive that which they did not as yet possess, but that
what they had received to no advantage in schism, and were already in
possession of, should be of profit to them, this God really confers and
bestows through the Catholic communion on those who come from any heresy
or schism in which they received the baptism of Christ; viz., not that
they should begin to receive the sacrament of baptism as not possessing
it before, but that what they already possessed should now begin to
profit them.
