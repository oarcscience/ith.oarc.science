id="iv.ii.i.i-p1.1"></span>I.  Sources.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p2"></span>The following bibliography of Manichæism
is taken from <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p2.1"></span>Schaff’s</span> *History of the Christian
Church*, vol. II. pp. 498–500 (new edition).  Additions are indicated by
brackets.

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p3"></span>1. Oriental Sources:  The most important,
though of comparatively late date.

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p4"></span>(a)  Mohammedan (Arabic):  *Kitâb al
Fihrist*.  A history of Arabic literature to 987, by an Arab of Bagdad,
usually called <span class="c11"><span id="iv.ii.i.i-p4.1"></span>Ibn
Abi Jakub An-Nadîm</span>; brought to light by Flügel, and published
after his death by Rödiger and Müller, in 2 vols. Leipz. 1871-’72.  Book
IX. section first, treats of Manichæism.  Flügel’s translation, see
below.  Kessler calls the Fihrist <span id="iv.ii.i.i-p4.2"></span>a
*"<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p4.3"></span>Fündstätte allerersten Ranges."* 
Next to it comes the relation of the Mohammedan philosopher, <span
class="c11"><span id="iv.ii.i.i-p4.4"></span>Al-Shahrastani</span> (d.
1153), in his *History of Religious Parties and Philosophical Sects*,
Ed. Cureton, Lond. 1842, 2 vols. (I. 188–192); German translation by
Haarbrücker, Halle, 1851.  On other Mohammedan sources, see Kessler in
Herzog, IX., 225 sq.

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p5"></span>(b)  Persian Sources:  relating to the
life of Mani, the Shâhnâmeh (the King’s Book) of <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p5.1"></span> Firdausi</span>; ed. by Jul. Mohl, Paris,
1866 (V. 472–475).  See Kessler, *ibid*. 225.

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p6"></span>\[<span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p6.1"></span>Albiruni’s</span> *Chronology of Ancient
Nations*, tr. by E. Sachau, and published by the Oriental Translation
Fund, Lond. 1879.  Albîrunî lived 973–1048, and is said to have
possessed vast literary resources no longer available to us.  His work
seems to be based on early Manichæan sources, and strikingly confirms
the narrative preserved by the *Fihrist*.  See also articles by <span

of the Asiatic Society*, 1868, 1870, 1871.\]

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p7"></span>(c)  Christian Sources:  In Arabic, the
Alexandrian Patriarch <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p7.1"></span>Eutychius</span> (d. 916). *Annales*, ed.
Pococke, Oxon. 1628; <span class="c11"><span id="iv.ii.i.i-p7.2"></span>
Barhebræus</span> (d. 1286), in his *Historia Dynastiarum*, ed.
Pococke.  In Syriac:  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p7.3"></span>Ephraem Syrus</span> (d. 393), in various
writings.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p7.4"></span>Esnig</span> or <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p7.5"></span>Esnik</span>, an Armenian bishop of the 5th
Century, who wrote against Marcion and Mani (German translation from the
Armenian by C. Fr. Neumann, in Illgen’s *<span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p7.6"></span>Zeitschrift für die Hist. Theologie*, 1834,
pp.77–78).

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p8"></span>2.  Greek Sources:  \[<span

Lycopolis</span>:  *The Tenets of the Manichæans* (first published by
Combefis, with a Latin version, in the *Auctararium Novissimum, Bibl. S.
S. Patrum*; again by Gallandi, in his *Bibl. Patrum*, vol. IV. p. 73
sq.  An English translation by Rev. James B.H. Hawkins, M .A ., appeared
in Clark’s *Ante-Nicene Library*, Vol. XIV. p. 236 sq.; Am. ed. vol. VI.
p. 237 sq.  Alexander represents himself as a convert from Paganism to
Manichæism, and from Manichæism to Orthodoxy.  He claims to have learned
Man<span id="page_6">p. 6</span> <span
id="iv.ii.i.i-Page_6"></span>ichæism from those who were intimately
associated with Mani himself, and is, therefore, one of the earliest
witnesses. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) \]  <span class="c11"><span

id="iv.ii.i.i-p9.9"></span>Petrus Siculus</span>, *Hist. Manichæorum*.\]

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p10"></span>3.  Latin Sources:  <span
class="c11"><span id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.1"></span> Archelaus</span> (Bishop
of Cascar in Mesopotamia, d. about 278):  *Acta Disputationis cum Manete
Hæresiarcha*; first written in Syriac, and so far belonging to the
Oriental Christian Sources (Comp. Jerome, *de Vir. Ill*. 72), but extant
only in a Latin translation, which seems to have been made from the
Greek, edited by <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.2"></span>Zacagni</span> (Rome, 1698), and <span
class="c11"><span id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.3"></span>Routh</span> (in *Reliquiæ
Sacræ*, vol. V. 3–206); Eng. transl. in Clark’s *Ante-Nicene Library*
(vol. XX. 272–419).  \[Am. ed. vol. VI. p. 173 sq.\].  These Acts
purport to contain the report of a disputation between Archelaus and
Mani before a large assembly, which was in full sympathy with the
orthodox bishop, but (as Beausobre first proved), they are in form a
fiction from the first quarter of the fourth century (about 320), by a
Syrian ecclesiastic (probably of Edessa), yet based upon Manichæan
documents, and containing much information about Manichæan doctrines. 
They consist of various pieces, and were the chief source of information
to the West.  Mani is represented (ch. 12), as appearing in a
many-colored cloak and trousers, with a sturdy staff of ebony, a
Babylonian book under his left arm, and with a mien of an old Persian
master.  In his defense he quotes freely from the N.T.  At the end, he
makes his escape to Persia (ch. 55).  Comp. <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.4"></span>H. V. Zittwitz</span>:<span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.5"></span>  *Die Acta Archelai et Manetis untersucht*,
in Kahnis’ *<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.6"></span>Zeitschrift für d. Hist.
Theol*. 1873, No. IV.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.7"></span>Oblasinski</span>:  *Acta Disput. Arch.*,
etc. Lips. 1874 (inaugural dissert.).  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.8"></span>Ad. Harnack</span>:  *<span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.9"></span>Die Acta Archelai und das Diatessaron
Tatians*, in *<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p10.10"></span>Texte und
Untersuchungen zur Gesch. der altchristl. Lit.* vol. I. Heft 3 (1883),
p. 137–153.  Harnack tries to prove that the Gospel variations of
Archelaus are taken from Tatian’s Diatessaron.

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p11"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p11.1"></span>St. Augustin</span> (d. 430, the chief Latin
authority next to the translation of Archelaus).  \[Besides the
treatises published in Clark’s series, *Contra Fortunatum quendam
Manichæorum Presbyterum Disput. I. et II., Contra Adimantum Manichæi
discipulum, Contra Secundinum Manichæum, De Natura Boni, De duabus
Animabus, De Utilitate Credendi, De Haeres*. XLVI.  Of these, *De duabus
Animabus, Contra Fortunatum*, and *De Natura Boni* are added in the
present edition, and *De Utilitate Credendi* has been included among
Augustin’s shorter theological treatises in vol. III. of the present
series.  In the *Confessions* and the *Letters*, moreover, the
Manichæans figure prominently.  The treatises included in the present
series may be said to fairly represent Augustin’s manner of dealing with
Manichæism.  The Anti-Manichæan writings are found chiefly in vol. VIII.
of the Benedictine edition, and in volumes I. and XI. of the Migne
reprint.  Augustin’s personal connection with the sect extending over a
period of nine years, and his consummate ability in dealing with this
form of error, together with the fact that he quotes largely from
Manichæan literature, render his works the highest authority for
Manichæism as it existed in the West at the close of the fifth
century.\]  Comp. also the Acts of Councils against the Manichæans from
the fourth century onwards, in Mansi and Hefele \[and Hardouin\].
