<span id="iv.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—What Sin is.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.xii-p2"></span>Some one will say:  What assistance would
this have furnished you against the Manichæans?  Wait a moment; permit
me first also to define sin, which, every mind reads divinely written in
itself, cannot exist apart from will.  Sin therefore is the will to
retain and follow after what justice forbids, and from which it is free
to abstain. <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211)   Although if it be
not free, it is not will.  But I have preferred to define more roughly
than precisely.  Should I not also have carefully examined those obscure
books, whence I might have learned that no one is worthy of blame or
punishment who either wills what justice does not prohibit him from
willing, or does not do what he is not able to do?  Do not shepherds on
mountains, poets in theatres, unlearned in social intercourse, learned
in libraries, masters in schools, priests in consecrated places, and the
human race throughout the whole world, sing out these things?  But if no
one is worthy of blame and condemnation, who either does not act against
the prohibition of justice, or who does not do what he cannot do, yet
every sin is blameworthy and condemnable, who doubts then that it is
sin, when willing is unjust, and not willing is free.  And hence that
definition is both true and easy to understand, and not only now but
then also could have been spoken by me:  Sin is the will of retaining or
of obtaining, what justice forbids, and whence it is free to abstain?

*Retractations*:  "The definition is true, inasmuch as that is defined
which is only sin, and not also that which is the penalty of
sin."—A.H.N.
