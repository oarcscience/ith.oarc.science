id="iv.vi.ii-p7.1"></span>Chapter 1.—By What Course of Reasoning the
Error of the Manichæans Concerning Two Souls, One of Which is Not from
God, is Refuted.  Every Soul, Inasmuch as It is a Certain Life, Can Have
Its Existence Only from God the Source of Life.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.ii-p8"></span>1.  Through the assisting mercy of God,
the snares of the Manichæans having been broken to pieces and left
behind, having been restored at length to the bosom of the Catholic
Church, I am disposed now at least to consider and to deplore my recent
wretchedness.  For there were many things that I ought to have done to
prevent the seeds of the most true religion wholesomely implanted in me
from boyhood, from being banished from my mind, having been uprooted by
the error and fraud of false and deceitful men.  For, in the first
place, if I had soberly and diligently considered, with prayerful and
pious mind, those two kinds of souls to which they attributed natures
and properties so distinct that they wished one to be regarded as of the
very substance of God, but were not even willing that God should be
accepted as the author of the other; perhaps it would have appeared to
me, intent on learning, that there is no life whatsoever, which, by the
very fact of its being life and in so far as it is life at all, does not
pertain to the supreme source and beginning of life, <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190) which we must acknowledge to be
nothing else than the supreme and only and true God.  Wherefore there is
no reason why we should not confess, that those souls which the
Manichæans call evil are either devoid of life and so not souls, neither
will anything positively or negatively, neither follow after nor flee
from anything; or, if they live so that they can be souls, and act as
the Manichæans suppose, in no way do they live unless by life, and if it
be an established fact, as it is, that Christ has said:  "I am the
life," <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191) that all souls seeing
that they cannot be souls except by living were created and fashioned by
Christ, that is, by the Life.

<span id="iv.vi.ii-p3"></span> Scarcely any one of his earlier treatises
was more unsatisfactory to Augustin in his later Anti-Pelagian years
than that *Concerning Two Souls*.  In his *Retractations*, Book I.,
chapter xv., he recognizes the rashness of some of his statements and
points out the sense in which they are tenable or the reverse.  As
regards the occasion of the writing, the following may be quoted: 
"After this book \[*De Utilitate Credendi*\] I wrote, while still a
presbyter, against the Manichæans *Concerning Two Souls*, of which they
say that one part is of God, the other from the race of darkness, which
God did not found, and which is coeternal with God, and they rave about
both these souls, the one good, the other evil, being in one man, saying
forsooth that the evil soul on the one hand belongs to the flesh, which
flesh also they say is of the race of darkness; but that the good soul
is from the part of God that came forth, combated the race of darkness,
and mingled with the latter; and they attribute all good things in man
to that good soul, and all evil things to that evil soul."—A.H.N.\]

<span id="iv.vi.ii-p9"></span> In his *Retractations*, Augustin explains
this proposition as follows:  "I said this in the sense in which the
creature is known to pertain to the Creator, but not in the sense that
it is of Him, so as to be regarded as part of Him."—A.H.N.
