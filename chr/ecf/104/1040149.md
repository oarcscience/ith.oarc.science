<span id="iv.ix.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="iv.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Book I.</span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p2"></span>Who Faustus was.  Faustus’s object in
writing the polemical treatise that forms the basis of Augustin’s reply.
 Augustin’s remarks thereon.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p3"></span>1.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.iii-p3.1"></span>Faustus</span> was an African by race, a
citizen of Mileum; he was eloquent and clever, but had adopted the
shocking tenets of the Manichæan heresy.  He is mentioned in my
*Confessions*, <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) where there is an
account of my acquaintance with him.  This man published a certain
volume against the true Christian faith and the Catholic truth.  A copy
reached us, and was read by the brethren, who called for an answer from
me, as part of the service of love which I owe to them.  Now, therefore,
in the name and with the help of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I
undertake the task, that all my readers may know that acuteness of mind
and elegance of style are of no use to a man unless the Lord directs his
steps. <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md)   In the mysterious
equity of divine mercy, God often bestows His help on the slow and the
feeble; while from the want of this help, the most acute and eloquent
run into error only <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> <span
id="iv.ix.iii-Page_156"></span>with greater rapidity and willfulness.  I
will give the opinions of Faustus as if stated by himself, and mine as
if in reply to him.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p6"></span>2.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.iii-p6.1"></span>Faustus</span> said:  As the learned
Adimantus, the only teacher since the sainted Manichæus deserving of our
attention, has plentifully exposed and thoroughly refuted the errors of
Judaism and of semi-Christianity, I think it not amiss that you should
be supplied in writing with brief and pointed replies to the captious
objections of our adversaries, that when, like children of the wily
serpent, they try to bewilder you with their quibbles, you may be
prepared to give intelligent answers.  In this way they will be kept to
the subject, instead of wandering from one thing to another.  And I have
placed our opinions and those of our opponent over against one another,
as plainly and briefly as possible, so as not to perplex the reader with
a long and intricate discourse.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p7"></span>3.  <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.ix.iii-p7.1"></span>Augustin</span> replies:  You warn against
semi-Christians, which you say we are; but we warn against
pseudo-Christians, which we have shown you to be.  Semi-Christianity may
be imperfect without being false.  So, then, if the faith of those whom
you try to mislead is imperfect, would it not be better to supply what
is lacking than to rob them of what they have?  It was to imperfect
Christians that the apostle wrote, "joying and beholding your
conversation," and "the deficiency in your faith in Christ." <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md)   The apostle had in view a spiritual
structure, as he says elsewhere, "Ye are God’s building;" <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) and in this structure he found both a
reason for joy and a reason for exertion.  He rejoiced to see part
already finished; and the necessity of bringing the edifice to
perfection called for exertion.  Imperfect Christians as we are, you
pursue us with the desire to pervert what you call our semi-Christianity
by false doctrine; while even those who are so deficient in faith as to
be unable to reply to all your sophisms, are wise enough at least to
know that they must not have anything at all to do with you.  You look
for semi-Christians to deceive:  we wish to prove you pseudo-Christians,
that Christians may learn something from your refutation, and that the
less advanced may learn to avoid you.  Do you call us children of the
serpent?  You have surely forgotten how often you have found fault with
the prohibition in Paradise, and have praised the serpent for opening
Adam’s eyes.  You have the better claim to the title which you give us. 
The serpent owns you as well when you blame him as when you praise him.
