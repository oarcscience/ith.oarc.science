<span id="v.v.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—</span>7.  Wherefore, whether a
man receive the sacrament of baptism from a faithful or a faithless
minister, his whole hope is in Christ, that he fall not under the
condemnation that "cursed is he that placeth his hope in man." 
Otherwise, if each man is born again in spiritual grace of the same sort
as he by whom he is baptized, and if when he who baptizes him is
manifestly a good man, then he himself gives faith, he is himself the
origin and root and head of him who is being born; whilst, when the
baptizer <span id="page_522">p. 522</span> <span
id="v.v.iii.vi-Page_522"></span>is faithless without its being known,
then the baptized person receives faith from Christ, then he derives his
origin from Christ, then he is rooted in Christ, then he boasts in
Christ as his head,—in that case all who are baptized should wish that
they might have faithless baptizers, and be ignorant of their
faithlessness:  for however good their baptizers might have been, Christ
is certainly beyond comparison better still; and He will then be the
head of the baptized, if the faithlessness of the baptizer shall escape
detection.
