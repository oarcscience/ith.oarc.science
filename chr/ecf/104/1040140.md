id="iv.viii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—Nature Made by God;
Corruption Comes from Nothing.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xxxix-p2"></span>44.  In this way, though corruption
is an <span id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span
id="iv.viii.xxxix-Page_149"></span>evil, and though it comes not from
the Author of natures, but from their being made out of nothing, still,
in God’s government and control over all that He has made, even
corruption is so ordered that it hurts only the lowest natures, for the
punishment of the condemned, and for the trial and instruction of the
returning, that they may keep near to the incorruptible God, and remain
incorrupt, which is our only good; as is said by the prophet, "But it is
good for me that I keep near to God." <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287)   And you must not say, God did not
make corruptible natures:  for, as far as they are natures, God made
them; but as far as they are corruptible, God did not make them:  for
corruption cannot come from Him who alone is incorruptible.  If you can
receive this, give thanks to God; if you cannot, be quiet and do not
condemn what you do not yet understand, but humbly wait on Him who is
the light of the mind that thou mayest know.  For in the expression
"corruptible nature" there are two words, and not one only.  So, in the
expression, God made out of nothing, "God" and "nothing" are two
separate words.  Render therefore to each of these words that which
belongs to each, so that the word "nature" may go with the word
"God,"and the word "corruptible" with the word "nothing."  And yet even
the corruptions, though they have not their origin from God, are to be
overruled by Him in accordance with the order of inanimate things and
the deserts of His intelligent creatures.  Thus we say rightly that
reward and punishment are both from God.  For God’s not making
corruption is consistent with His giving over to corruption the man who
deserves to be corrupted, that is, who has begun to corrupt himself by
sinning, that he who has wilfully yielded to the allurements of
corruption may, against his will, suffer its pains.
