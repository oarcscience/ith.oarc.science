"If Paul uttered these words to the unlearned and to the righteous, I
say this to you who are unrighteous, Is Christ divided, that you should
separate yourselves from the Church?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xlii-p2"></span>100.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xlii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I am afraid lest
any one should think that in this work of mine the writer has made a
mistake, and has written the heading *Petilianus said,* when he ought to
have written *Augustin answered.*  But I see what your object is:  you
wished, as <span id="page_557">p. 557</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.xlii-Page_557"></span>it were, to preoccupy the ground, lest
we should bring those words in testimony against you.  But what have you
really done, except to cause them to be quoted twice?  If, therefore,
you are so much pleased with hearing the words which make against you,
as to render it necessary that they should be repeated, hear, I pray
you, these words as coming from me, Petilianus:  Is Christ divided, that
you should separate yourselves from the Church?
