id="iv.x.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Evil is Corruption of Measure, Form,
or Order.</span>

<span id="iv.x.vi-p2"></span>When accordingly it is inquired, whence is
evil, it must first be inquired, what is evil, which is nothing else
than corruption, either of the measure, or the form, or the order, that
belong to nature.  Nature therefore which has been corrupted, is called
evil, for assuredly when incorrupt it is good; but even when corrupt, so
far as it is nature it is good, so far as it is corrupted it is evil.
