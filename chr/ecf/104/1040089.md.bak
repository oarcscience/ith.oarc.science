<span id="iv.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—The Manichæans Inquire Whence is
Evil and by This Question Think They Have Triumphed.  Let Them First
Know, Which is Most Easy to Do, that Nothing Can Live Without God. 
Consummate Evil Cannot Be Known Except by the Knowledge of Consummate
Good, Which is God.</span>

<span id="iv.vi.ix-p2"></span>Here perchance some one may say:  Whence
are sins themselves, and whence is evil in general?  If from man, whence
is man? if from an angel, whence is the angel?  When it is said, however
truly and rightly, that these are from God, it nevertheless seems to
those unskillful and possessed of little power to look into recondite
matters, that evils and sins are thereby connected, as by a sort of
chain, to God.  By this question they think themselves triumphant, as if
forsooth to ask were to know;—would it were so, for in that case no one
would be more knowing than myself.  Yet very often in controversy the
propounder of a great question, while impersonating the great teacher,
is himself more ignorant in the matter concerning which he would
frighten his opponent, than he whom he would frighten.

<span id="iv.vi.ix-p3"></span>These therefore suppose that they are
superior to the common run, because the former ask questions that the
latter cannot answer.  If therefore when I most unfortunately was
associated with them, not in the position in which I have now for some
time been, they had raised these objections when I <span
id="page_101">p. 101</span> <span id="iv.vi.ix-Page_101"></span>had
brought forward this argument, I should have said:  I ask that you
meanwhile agree with me, which is most easy, that if nothing can shine
without God, much less can anything live without God.  Let us not
persist in such monstrous opinions as to maintain that any souls
whatsoever have life apart from God.  For perchance it may so happen
that with me you are ignorant as to this thing, namely whence is evil,
let us then learn either simultaneously or in any order, I care not
what.  For what if knowledge of the perfection of evil is impossible to
man without knowledge of the perfection of good?  For we should not know
darkness if we were always in darkness.  But the notion of light does
not allow its opposite to be unknown.  But the highest good is that than
which there is nothing higher.  But God is good and than Him nothing can
be higher.  God therefore is the highest good.  Let us therefore
together so recognize God, and thus what we seek too hastily will not be
hidden from us.  Do you suppose then that the knowledge of God is a
matter of small account or desert.  For what other reward is there for
us than life eternal, which is to know God?  For God the Master says: 
"But this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only and true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md)   For the soul, although it is
immortal, yet because aversion from the knowledge of God is rightly
called its death, when it is converted to God, the reward of eternal
life to be attained is that knowledge; so that this is, as has been
said, eternal life.  But no one can be converted to God, except he turn
himself away from this world.  This for myself I feel to be arduous and
exceedingly difficult, whether it is easy to you, God Himself would have
seen.  I should have been inclined to think it easy to you, had I not
been moved by the fact, that, since the world from which we are
commanded to turn away is visible, and the apostle says:  "The things
that are seen are temporal, but the things that are unseen are
eternal," <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) you ascribe more
importance to the judgment of these eyes than to that of the mind,
asserting and believing as you do that there is no shining feather that
does not shine from God; and that there are living souls that do not
live from God.  These and like things I should either have said to them
or considered with myself, for even then, supplicating God with all my
bowels, so to speak, and examining as attentively as possible the
Scriptures, I should perchance have been able either to say such things
or to think them, so far as was necessary for my salvation.
