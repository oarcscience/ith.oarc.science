<span id="v.v.v.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—</span>31.  But why do we make
inquiry into these points?  Why do we both suffer and cause unnecessary
delay?  Are we likely to find out by such a course as this what means we
are to use for cleansing the conscience of the recipient, who does not
know that the conscience of the giver is stained with guilt:  whence the
man is to receive faith who is unwittingly baptized by one that is
faithless?—the question which Petilianus had proposed to himself to
answer in my epistle, then going on to say anything else he pleased
except what the matter in hand required.  How often has he said, "If
ignorant you were,"—as though I had said, what I never did say, that I
was unacquainted with the conscience of him who baptized me.  And he
seemed to have no other object in all that his evil-speaking mouth
poured forth, except that he should appear to prove that I had not been
ignorant of the misdeeds of those among whom I was baptized, and with
whom I was associated in communion, understanding fully, it would seem,
that ignorance did not convict me of guilt.  See then that if I were
ignorant, as he has repeated so often, beyond all doubt I should be
innocent of all these crimes.  Whence therefore should I be cleansed,
who am unacquainted with the conscience of him who gives but not in
holiness, so that I may be least ensnared by his offenses?  Whence then
should I receive faith, seeing that I was baptized unwittingly by one
that was faithless?  For he has not repeated "If ignorant you were" so
often without purpose, but simply to prevent my being reputed innocent,
esteeming beyond all doubt that no man’s innocence is violated if he
unwittingly receives his faith from one that is faithless, <span
id="page_609">p. 609</span> <span id="v.v.v.xxvi-Page_609"></span>and is
not acquainted with the stains on the conscience of him that gives, but
not in holiness.  Let him say, therefore, by what means such men are to
be cleansed, whence they are to receive not guilt but faith.  But let
him not deceive you.  Let him not, while uttering much, say nothing; or
rather, let him not say much while saying nothing.  Next, to urge a
point which occurs to me, and must not be passed over,—if I am guilty
because I have not been ignorant, to use his own phraseology, and I am
proved not to have been ignorant, because I am an African, and already
advanced in years, let him grant that the youths of other nations
throughout the world are not guilty, who had no opportunity either from
their race, or from that age you bring against me, of knowing the points
that are laid to our charge, be they true, or be they false; and yet
they, if they have fallen into your hands, are rebaptized without any
considerations of such a kind.
