<span id="v.v.iv.lxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 77.—</span>169.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxxvii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span>
said:  "Paul also, the apostle, whilst he was suffering fearful
persecutions at the hands of all nations, endured even more grievous
troubles at the hands of false brethren, as he bears witness of himself,
being oftentimes afflicted:  ‘In perils by the heathen, in perils by
mine own countrymen, in perils among false brethren.’ <span
id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180)   And again he says, ‘Be ye
followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.’ <span
id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181)   When, therefore, false brethren
like yourselves assault us, we imitate the patience of our master Paul
under our dangers."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxvii-p4"></span>170.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxvii-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Certainly
those of whom you speak are false brethren, of whom the apostle thus
complains in another place, where he is extolling the natural sincerity
of Timothy:  "I have no man," he says, "like-minded, who will naturally
care for your state.  For all seek their own, not the things which are
Jesus Christ’s." <span id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182)  
Undoubtedly he was speaking of those who were with him at the time when
he was writing that epistle; for it could not be that all Christians in
every quarter of the earth were seeking their own, and not the things
which were Jesus Christ’s.  It was of those, therefore, as I said, who
were with him at the time when he was writing the words which you have
quoted, that he uttered this lamentation.  For who else was it to whom
he referred, when he says in another place, "Without were fightings,
within were fears," <span id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183) except
those whom he feared all the more intensely because they were within? 
If, therefore, you would imitate Paul, you would be tolerant of false
brethren within, not a slanderer of the innocent without.
