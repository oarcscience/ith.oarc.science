Be Moderate-Sized. <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) </span>

<span id="iv.x.xxiii-p3"></span>Therefore now by common usage things
small and mean are said to have measure, because some measure remains in
them, without which they would no longer be moderate-sized, but would
not exist at all.  But those things that by reason of too much progress
are called immoderate, are blamed for very excessiveness; but yet it is
necessary that those things themselves be restrained in some manner
under God who has disposed all things in extension, number, and weight.
