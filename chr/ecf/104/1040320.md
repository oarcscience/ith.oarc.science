<span id="v.iv.vi.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—</span>30.  That the place of
baptism is sometimes supplied by martyrdom is supported by an argument
by no means trivial, which the blessed Cyprian adduces <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458) from the thief, to whom, though he
was not baptized, it was yet said, "To-day shall thou be with me in
Paradise." <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459)   On considering
which, again and again, I find that not only martyrdom for the sake of
Christ may supply what was wanting of baptism, but also faith and
conversion of heart, if recourse may not be had to the celebration of
the mystery of baptism for want of time. <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460)   For neither was that thief
crucified for the name of Christ, but as the reward of his own deeds;
nor did he suffer because he believed, but he believed while suffering. 
It was shown, therefore, in the case of that thief, how great is the
power, even without the visible sacrament of baptism, of what the
apostle says, "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with
the mouth confession is made unto salvation." <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461)   But the want is supplied
invisibly only when the administration of baptism is prevented, not by
contempt for religion, but by the necessity of the moment.  For much
more in the case of Cornelius and his friends, than in the case of that
robber, might it seem superfluous that they should also be baptized with
water, seeing that in them the gift of the Holy Spirit, which, according
to the testi<span id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span
id="v.iv.vi.xxii-Page_461"></span>mony of holy Scripture, was received
by other men only after baptism, had made itself manifest by every
unmistakable sign appropriate to those times when they spoke with
tongues.  Yet they were baptized, and for this action we have the
authority of an apostle as the warrant.  So far ought all of us to be
from being induced by any imperfection in the inner man, if it so happen
that before baptism a person has advanced, through the workings of a
pious heart, to spiritual understanding, to despise a sacrament which is
applied to the body by the hands of the minister, but which is God’s own
means for working spiritually a man’s dedication to Himself.  Nor do I
conceive that the function of baptizing was assigned to John, so that it
should be called John’s baptism, for any other reason except that the
Lord Himself, who had appointed it, in not disdaining to receive the
baptism of His servant, <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462) might
consecrate the path of humility, and show most plainly by such an action
how high a value was to be placed on His own baptism, with which He
Himself was afterwards to baptize.  For He saw, like an excellent
physician of eternal salvation, that overweening pride would be found in
some, who, having made such progress in the understanding of the truth
and in uprightness of character that they would not hesitate to place
themselves, both in life and knowledge, above many that were baptized,
would think it was unnecessary for them to be baptized, since they felt
that they had attained a frame of mind to which many that were baptized
were still only endeavoring to raise themselves.
