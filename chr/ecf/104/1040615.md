<span id="v.v.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—</span>21.  Certainly in all
these things, as you can learn or refresh your memory by reading his
letter, he has given free scope to the impulse of his tongue, with all
the license of boasting which he chose to use, but nowhere has he told
us where means are to be found for cleansing the conscience of the
recipient, when that of the giver has been stained with sin without his
knowing it.  But amid all his noise, and after all his noise, serious as
it is, too terrible as he himself supposes it to be, I deliberately, as
it is said, and to the purpose, <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371) ask this question once again:  If
the conscience of him who gives in holiness is what we look for, what
means are to be found for cleansing one who receives baptism without
knowing that the conscience of the giver is stained with sin?  And
throughout his whole epistle I find nothing said in answer to this
question.

suiting better with *"lente."*
