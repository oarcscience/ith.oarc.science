<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxiv"></span>

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—</span>65.  Quietus of
Burug <span id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711) said:  "We who live by
faith ought with believing observance to obey what has been before
foretold for our instruction.  For it is written in Solomon, ‘He that is
washed by one dead, what availeth his washing?’ <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712)   Which assuredly he says of those
who are washed by heretics, and of those who wash.  For if they who are
baptized among them receive eternal life through the remission of their
sins, why do they come to the Church?  But if no salvation is received
from a dead person, and they therefore, acknowledging their former
error, return with penance to the truth, they ought to be sanctified
with the one life-giving baptism which is in the Catholic Church."
 <span id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxiv-p5"></span>66.  What it is to be baptized by
the dead, we have already, without prejudice to the more careful
consideration of the same scripture, sufficiently declared before. <span
id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714)   But I would ask why it is that
they wish heretics alone to be considered dead, when Paul the apostle
has said generally of sin, "The wages of sin is death;" <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715) and again, "To be carnally minded
is death." <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716)   And when he says
that a widow that liveth in pleasure is dead, <span
id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717) how are they not dead "who renounce
the world in words and not in deeds"?  What, therefore, is the profit of
washing in him who is baptized by them, except, indeed, that if he
himself also is of the same character, he has the laver indeed, but it
does not profit him to salvation?  But if he by whom he is baptized
<span id="page_495">p. 495</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxiv-Page_495"></span>is such, but the man who is
baptized is turned to the Lord with no false heart, he is not baptized
by that dead person, but by that living One of whom it is said, "The
same is He which baptizeth." <span id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718)
  But to what he says of heretics, that if they who are baptized among
them receive eternal life through the remission of their sins, why do
they come to the Church? we answer:  They come for this reason, that
although they have received the baptism of Christ up to the point of the
celebration of the sacrament, yet they cannot attain to life eternal
save through the charity of unity; just as neither would those envious
and malicious ones attain to life eternal, who would not have their sins
forgiven them, even if they entertained hatred only against those from
whom they suffered wrong; since the Truth said, "If ye forgive not men
their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your
trespasses," <span id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719) how much less
when they were hating those towards whom they were rewarding evil for
good? <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720)   And yet these men,
though "renouncing the world in words and not in deeds," would not be
baptized again, if they should afterwards be corrected, but they would
be made holy by the one living baptism.  And this is indeed in the
Catholic Church, but not in it alone, as neither is it in the saints
alone who are built upon the rock, and of whom that one dove is
composed. <span id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721)
