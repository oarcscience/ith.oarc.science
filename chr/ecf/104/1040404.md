<span id="v.iv.ix.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—</span>8.  Aurelius of Utica <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) said: <span id="page_502">p.
502</span> <span id="v.iv.ix.v-Page_502"></span>"Since the apostle says
that we ought not to be partakers with the sins of other men, <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) what else does he do but make
himself partaker with the sins of other men, who holds communion with
heretics without the baptism of the Church?  And therefore I pronounce
my judgment that heretics should be baptized, that they may receive
remission of their sins, and so communion be allowed to them." <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md)

<span id="v.iv.ix.v-p5"></span>9.  The answer is:  Therefore Cyprian and
all those bishops were partakers in the sins of other men, inasmuch as
they remained in communion with such men, when they removed no one from
the right of communion who entertained a different opinion.  Where,
then, is the Church?  Then, to say nothing for the moment of
heretics,—since the words of this judgment are applicable also to other
sinners, such as Cyprian saw with lamentation to be in the Church with
him, whom, while he confuted them, he yet tolerated,—where is the
Church, which, according to these words must be held to have perished
from that very moment by the contagion of their sins?  But if, as is the
most firmly established truth, the Church both has remained and does
remain, the partaking of the sins of others, which is forbidden by the
apostle, must be considered only to consist in consenting to them.  But
let heretics be baptized again, that they may receive remission of their
sins, if the wayward and the envious are baptized again, who, seeing
that "they renounced the world in words and not in deeds," were indeed
able to receive baptism, but did not obtain remission of their sins, as
the Lord says, "If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
your Father forgive your trespasses." <span

ecclesiastical province of Zeugitana.  The Aurelius of Cypr. Epp. xxvii.
4, lvii. and lxvii. (the first) are more likely to be identical with the
bishop of Utica, than with the Aurelius of Chullabis, who delivers his
opinion the 81st in order.
