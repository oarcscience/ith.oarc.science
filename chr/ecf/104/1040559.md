id="v.v.iv.lxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 72.—</span>159.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxxii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"‘Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake; for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven.’ <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md)   You are not blessed; but you make
martyrs to be blessed, with whose souls the heavens are filled, and the
earth has flourished with their memory.  You therefore do not honor them
yourselves, but you provide us with objects of honor."

<span id="v.v.iv.lxxii-p3"></span>160.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxxii-p3.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  The plain fact
is, that if it had not been said, "Blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness’ sake," but had been said instead, Blessed are they
who throw themselves over precipices, then heaven would have been filled
with your martyrs.  Of a truth we see many flowers on the earth blooming
from their bodies; but, as the saying goes, the flower is dust and
ashes.
