<span id="v.iv.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—</span>5.  Further, if any one
fails to understand how it can be that we assert that the sacrament is
not rightly conferred among the Donatists, while we confess that it
exists among them, let him observe that we also deny that it exists
rightly among them, just as they deny that it exists rightly among those
who quit their communion.  Let him also consider the analogy of the
military mark, which, though it can both be retained, as by deserters,
and, also be received by those who are not in the army, yet ought not to
be either received or retained outside its ranks; and, at the same time,
it is not changed or renewed when a man is enlisted or brought back to
his service.  However, we must distinguish between the case of those who
unwittingly join the ranks of these heretics, under the impression that
they are entering the true Church of Christ, and those who know that
there is no other Catholic Church save that which, according to the
promise, is spread abroad throughout the whole world, and extends even
to the utmost limits of the earth; which, rising amid tares, and seeking
rest in the future from the weariness of offenses, says in the Book of
Psalms, "From the end of the earth I cried unto Thee, while my heart was
in weariness:  Thou didst exalt me on a rock." <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md)   But the rock was Christ, in whom
the apostle says that we are now raised up, and set together in heavenly
places, though not yet actually, but only in hope. <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md)   And so the psalm goes on to say,
"Thou wast my guide, because Thou art become my hope, a tower of
strength from the face of the enemy." <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md)   By means of His promises, which
are like spears and javelins stored up in a strongly fortified place,
the enemy is not only guarded against, but overthrown, as he clothes his
wolves in sheep’s clothing, <span id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md)
that they may say, "Lo, here is Christ, or there;" <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154.md) and that they may separate many
from the Catholic city which is built upon a hill, and bring them down
to the isolation of their own snares, so as utterly to destroy them. 
And these men, knowing this, choose to receive the baptism of Christ
without the limits of the communion of the unity of Christ’s body,
though they intend afterwards, with the sacrament which they have
received elsewhere, to pass into that very communion.  For they propose
to receive Christ’s baptism in antagonism to the Church of Christ, well
knowing that it is so even on the very day on which they receive it. 
And if this is a sin, who is the man that will say, Grant that for a
single day I may commit sin?  For if he proposes to pass over to the
Catholic Church, I would fain ask why.  What other answer can he give,
but that it is ill to belong to the party of Donatus, and not to the
unity of the Catholic Church?  Just so many days, then, as you commit
this ill, of so many days’ sin are you going to be guilty.  And it may
be said that there is greater sin in more days’ commission of it, and
less in fewer; but in no wise can it be said that no sin is committed at
all.  But what is the need of allowing this accursed wrong for a single
day, or a single hour?  For the man who wishes this license to be
granted him, might as well ask of the Church, or of God Himself, that
for a single day he should be permitted to apostatize.  For there is no
reason why he should fear to be an apostate for a day, if he does not
shrink from being for that time a schismatic or a heretic.
