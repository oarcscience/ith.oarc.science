<span id="v.iv.vii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—</span>30.  Accordingly we
agree with Cyprian that "heretics cannot give remission of sins;" <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539) but we maintain that they can give
baptism,—which indeed in them, both when they give and when they receive
it, is profitable only to their destruction, as misusing so great a gift
of God; just as also the malicious and envious, whom Cyprian himself
acknowledges to be within the Church, cannot give remission of sins,
while we all confess that they can give baptism.  For if it was said of
those who have sinned against us, "If ye forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses," <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540) how much more impossible is it that
their sins should be forgiven who hate the brethren by whom they are
loved, and are baptized in that very hatred; and yet when they are
brought to the right way, baptism is not given them anew, but that very
pardon which they did not then deserve is granted them in their true
conversion?  And so even what Cyprian wrote to Quintus, and what, in
conjunction with his colleagues Liberalis, Caldonius, Junius, and the
rest, he wrote to Saturninus, Maximus, and others, is all found, on due
consideration, to be in no wise meet to be preferred as against the
agreement of the whole Catholic Church, of which they rejoiced that they
were members, and from which they neither cut themselves away nor
allowed others to be cut away who held a contrary opinion, until at
length, by the will of the Lord, it was made manifest, by a plenary
Council many years afterwards, what was the more perfect way, and that
not by the institution of any novelty, but by confirming what was old.
