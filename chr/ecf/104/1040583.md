id="v.v.iv.xcvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 96.—</span>218.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xcvi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But what reason is there, or what inconsistency of emptiness, in
desiring communion with us so eagerly, when all the time you call us by
the false title of heretics?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xcvi-p2"></span>219.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xcvi-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  If we so eagerly
desired communion with heretics, we should not be anxious that you
should be converted from the error of heresy; but when the very object
of our negotiations with you is that you should cease to be heretics,
how are we eagerly desiring communion with heretics?  For, in fact, it
is dissension and division that make you heretics; but peace and unity
make men Catholics.  When, then, you come over from your heresy to us,
you cease to be what we hate, and begin to be what we love.
