<span id="v.v.iv.lxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 67.—</span>149.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lxvii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"‘Blessed are the merciful:  for they shall obtain mercy.’  But how
shall I call you merciful when you inflict punishment on the righteous? 
Shall I not rather call you a most unrighteous communion, so long as you
pollute souls?"

<span id="v.v.iv.lxvii-p2"></span>150.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lxvii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  You have proved
neither point,—neither that you yourselves are righteous, nor that we
inflict punishment on even the unrighteous; and yet, even as false
flattery is generally cruel, so just correction is ever merciful.  For
whence is that which you do not understand:  "Let the righteous smite
me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me"?  For while he says
this of the severity of merciful correction, the Psalmist immediately
went on to say of the gentleness of destructive flattery, "But the oil
of sinners shall not break my head." <span
id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md)   Do you therefore consider whither
you are called, and from what you are summoned away.  For how do you
know what feelings he entertains towards you whom you suppose to be
cruel?  But whatever be his feelings, every one must bear his own burden
both with us and with you.  But I would have you cast away the burden of
schism which you all of you are bearing, that you may bear your good
burdens in unity; and I would bid you mercifully correct, if you should
have the power, all those who are bearing evil burdens; and, if this be
beyond your power, I would bid you bear with them in peace.
