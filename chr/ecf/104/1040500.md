<span id="v.v.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—</span>29.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xiii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
Over and over again He reproaches the false speakers and liars in such
terms as these:  ‘Ye are the children of the devil, for he also was a
slanderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.’"

<span id="v.v.iv.xiii-p2"></span>30.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  We are not wont
to say, "He was a slanderer," but "He was a murderer." <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998)   But we ask how it was that the
devil was a murderer from the beginning; and we find that he slew the
first man, not by drawing a sword, nor by applying to him any bodily
violence, but by persuading him to <span id="page_536">p. 536</span>
<span id="v.v.iv.xiii-Page_536"></span>sin, and thus driving him from
the happiness of Paradise.  What, then, was Paradise is now represented
by the Church.  Therefore those are the sons of the devil who slay men
by withdrawing them from the Church.  But as by the words of God we know
what was the situation of Paradise, so now by the words of Christ we
have learned where the Church is to be found:  "Throughout all nations,"
He says, "beginning at Jerusalem."  Whosoever, therefore, separates a
man from that complete whole to place him in any single part, is proved
to be a son of the devil and a murderer.  But see, further, what is the
application of the expression which you yourself employed in saying of
the devil, "He was a slanderer, and abode not in the truth."  For you
bring an accusation against the whole world on account of the sins of
others, though even those others themselves you were more able to accuse
than to convict; and you abode not in the truth of Christ.  For He says
that the Church is "throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem;" but
ye say that it is in the party of Donatus.
