<span id="iv.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Man—What?</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>6.  Let us then see what is better than
man.  This must necessarily be hard to find, unless <span
id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span id="iv.iv.vi-Page_43"></span>we first
ask and examine what man is.  I am not now called upon to give a
definition of man.  The question here seems to me to be,—since almost
all agree, or at least, which is enough, those I have now to do with are
of the same opinion with me, that we are made up of soul and body,—What
is man?  Is he both of these? or is he the body only, or the soul only? 
For although the things are two, soul and body, and although neither
without the other could be called man (for the body would not be man
without the soul, nor again would the soul be man if there were not a
body animated by it), still it is possible that one of these may be held
to be man, and may be called so.  What then do we call man?  Is he soul
and body, as in a double harness, or like a centaur?  Or do we mean the
body only, as being in the service of the soul which rules it, as the
word lamp denotes not the light and the case together, but only the
case, yet it is on account of the light that it is so called?  Or do we
mean only the mind, and that on account of the body which it rules, as
horseman means not the man and the horse, but the man only, and that as
employed in ruling the horse?  This dispute is not easy to settle; or,
if the proof is plain, the statement requires time.  This is an
expenditure of time and strength which we need not incur.  For whether
the name man belongs to both, or only to the soul, the chief good of man
is not the chief good of the body; but what is the chief good either of
both soul and body, or of the soul only, that is man’s chief good.
