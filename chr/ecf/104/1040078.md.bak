<span id="iv.v.xxi"></span>

<span id="iv.v.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Crimes of the Manichæans.</span>

<span id="iv.v.xxi-p2"></span>67.  We see then, now, the nature of your
three symbols.  These are your customs.  This is the end of your notable
precepts, in which there is nothing sure, nothing steadfast, nothing
consistent, nothing irreproachable, but all doubtful, or rather
undoubtedly and entirely false, all contradictory, abominable, absurd. 
In a word, evil practices are detected in your customs so many and so
serious, that one wishing to denounce them all, if he were at all able
to enlarge, would require at least a separate treatise for each.  Were
you to observe these, and to act up to your profession, no childishness,
or folly, or absurdity would go beyond yours; and when you praise and
teach these things without doing them, you display craft and deceit and
malevolence equal to anything that can be described or imagined.

<span id="iv.v.xxi-p3"></span>68.  During nine full years that I
attended you with great earnestness and assiduity, I could not hear of
one of your elect who was not found transgressing these precepts, or at
least was not suspected of doing so.  Many were caught at wine and
animal food, many at the baths; but this we only heard by report.  Some
were proved to have seduced other men’s wives, so that in this case I
could not doubt the truth of the charge.  But suppose this, too, a
report rather than a fact.  I myself saw, and not I only, but others who
have either escaped from that superstition, or will, I hope, yet
escape,—we saw, I say, in a square in Carthage, on a road much
frequented, not one, but more than three of the elect walking behind us,
and accosting some women with such indecent sounds and gestures as to
outdo the boldness and insolence of all ordinary rascals.  And it was
clear that this was quite habitual, and that they behaved in this way to
one another, for no one was deterred by the presence of a companion,
showing that most of them, if not all, were affected with this evil
tendency.  For they did not all come from one house, but lived in quite
different places, and quite accidentally left together the place where
they had met.  It was a great shock to us, and we lodged a complaint
about it.  But who thought of inflicting punishment,—I say not by
separation from the church, but even by severe rebuke in proportion to
the heinousness of the offence?

<span id="iv.v.xxi-p4"></span>69.  All the excuse given for the impunity
of those men was that, at that time, when their meetings were forbidden
by law, it was feared that the persons suffering punishment might
retaliate by giving information.  What then of their assertion that they
will always have persecution in this world, for which they suppose that
they will be thought the more of? for this is the application they make
of the words about the world hating them.  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md)   And they will have it that truth
must be sought for among them, because, in the promise of the Holy
Spirit, the Paraclete, it is said that the world cannot receive
Him. <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md)   This is not the place to
discuss this question.  But clearly, <span id="page_88">p. 88</span>
<span id="iv.v.xxi-Page_88"></span>if you are always to be persecuted,
even to the end of the world, there will be no end to this laxity, and
to the unchecked spread of all this immorality, from your fear of giving
offence to men of this character.

<span id="iv.v.xxi-p7"></span>70.  This answer was also given to us,
when we reported to the very highest authorities that a woman had
complained to us that in a meeting, where she was along with other
women, not doubting of the sanctity of these people, some of the elect
came in, and when one of them had put out the lamp, one, whom she could
not distinguish, tried to embrace her, and would have forced her into
sin, had she not escaped by crying out.  How common must we conclude the
practice to have been which led to the misdeed on this occasion!  And
this was done on the night when you keep the feast of vigils.  Forsooth,
besides the fear of information being given, no one could bring the
offender before the bishop, as he had so well guarded against being
recognized.  As if all who entered along with him were not implicated in
the crime; for in their indecent merriment they all wished the lamp to
be put out.

<span id="iv.v.xxi-p8"></span>71.  Then what wide doors were opened for
suspicions, when we saw them full of envy, full of covetousness, full of
greed for costly foods, constantly at strife, easily excited about
trifles!  We concluded that they were not competent to abstain from the
things they professed to abstain from, if they found an opportunity in
secret or in the dark.  There were two of sufficiently good character,
of active minds, and leaders in their debates, with whom we had a more
particular and intimate acquaintance than with the rest.  One of them
was much associated with us, because he was also engaged in liberal
studies; he is said to be now an elder there.  These two were very
jealous of one another, and one accused the other—not openly, but in
conversation, as he had opportunity, and in whispers—of having made a
criminal assault on the wife of one of the followers.  He again, in
clearing himself to us, brought the same charge against another of the
elect, who lived with this follower as his most trusted friend.  He had,
going in suddenly, caught this man with the woman, and his enemy and
rival had advised the woman and her paramour to raise this false report
about him, that he might not be believed if he gave any information.  We
were much distressed, and took it greatly to heart, that although there
was a doubt about the assault on the woman, the jealous feeling in those
two men, than whom we found none better in the place, showed itself so
keenly, and inevitably raised a suspicion of other things. <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md)

<span id="iv.v.xxi-p10"></span>72.  Another thing was, that we very
often saw in theatres men belonging to the elect, men of years and, it
was supposed, of character, along with a hoary-headed elder.  We pass
over the youths, whom we used to come upon quarrelling about the people
connected with the stage and the races; from which we may safely
conclude how they would be able to refrain in secret, when they could
not subdue the passion by which they were exposed in the eyes of their
followers, bringing on them disgrace and flight.  In the case of the
saint, whose discussions we attended in the street of the fig-sellers,
would his atrocious crime have been discovered if he had been able to
make the dedicated virgin his wife without making her pregnant?  The
swelling womb betrayed the secret and unthought-of iniquity.  When her
brother, a young man, heard of it from his mother, he felt keenly the
injury, but refrained, from regard to religion, from a public
accusation.  He succeeded in getting the man expelled from that church,
for such conduct cannot always be tolerated; and that the crime might
not be wholly unpunished, he arranged with some of his friends to have
the man well beaten and kicked.  When he was thus assailed, he cried out
that they should spare him, from regard to the authority of the opinion
of Manichæus, that Adam the first hero had sinned, and was a greater
saint after his sin.

<span id="iv.v.xxi-p11"></span>73.  This, in fact, is your notion about
Adam and Eve. <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md)   It is a long
story; but I will touch only on what concerns the present matter.  You
say that Adam was produced from his parents, the abortive princes of
darkness; that he had in his soul the most part of light, and very
little of the opposite race.  So while he lived a holy life, on account
of the prevalence of good, still the opposite part in him was stirred
up, so that he was led away into conjugal intercourse.  Thus he fell and
sinned, but afterwards lived in greater holiness.  Now, my complaint is
not so much about this wicked man, who, under the garb of an elect and
holy man, brought such shame and reproach on a family of strangers by
his shocking immorality.  I do not charge you with this.  Let it be
attributed to the abandoned character of the man, and not to your
habits.  I blame the man for the atrocity, and not you.  Still there is
<span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span id="iv.v.xxi-Page_89"></span>this
in you all that cannot, as far as I can see, be admitted or tolerated,
that while you hold the soul to be part of God, you still maintain that
the mixture of a little evil prevailed over the superior force and
quantity of good.  Who that believes this, when incited by passion, will
not find here an excuse, instead of checking and controlling his
passion?
