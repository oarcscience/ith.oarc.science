<span id="v.iv.viii.vii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.viii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—</span>10.  I have already, I
think, argued to the best of my power, in the preceding books, in the
interests of Catholic unanimity and counsel, in whose unity these
continued as pious members, in reply not only to the letter which
Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus, but also to that which he sent to Quintus,
and that which, in conjunction with certain of his colleagues, he sent
to certain other colleagues, and that which he sent to Pompeius. 
Wherefore it seems now to be fitting to consider also what the others
severally thought, and that with the liberty of which he himself would
not deprive us, as he says, "Judging no one, nor removing any from the
right of communion if he entertain different opinions."  And that he did
not say this with the object of arriving at the hidden thoughts of his
colleagues, extracted as it were from their secret lurking-places, but
because he really loved peace and unity, is very easily to be seen from
other passages of the same sort, where he wrote to individuals as to
Jubaianus himself.  "These things," he says, "we have written very
shortly in answer to you, most beloved brother, according to our poor
ability, not preventing any one of the bishops by our writing or
judgment, from acting as he thinks right, having a free exercise of his
own judgment." <span id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md)   And that it
might not seem that any one, because of his entertaining different
opinions in this same free exercise of his judgment, should be driven
from the society of his brethren, he goes on to say, "We, so far as lies
in us, do not strive on behalf of heretics against our colleagues and
fellow-bishops, with whom we maintain godly unity and the peace of our
Lord;" <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md) and a little later he
says, "Charity of spirit, respect for our fraternity, the bond of faith,
the harmony of the priesthood, are by us maintained with patience and
gentleness." <span id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md)   And so also in
the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, when he was asked whether there
was any difference in the efficacy of baptism by sprinkling or by
immersion, "In this matter," he says, "I am too modest and diffident to
prevent any one by my judgment from thinking as he deems right, and
acting as he thinks." <span id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md)   By
which discourses he clearly shows that these subjects were being handled
by them at a time when they were not yet received as decided beyond all
question, but were being investigated with great care as being yet
unrevealed.  We, therefore, maintaining on the subject of the identity
of all baptisms what must be acknowledged everywhere to be the
custom <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) of the universal
Church, and what is confirmed by the decision of general Councils, <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) and taking greater confidence also
from the words of Cyprian, which allowed me even then to hold opinions
differing from his own without forfeiting the right of communion, seeing
that greater importance and praise were attached to unity, such as the
blessed Cyprian and his colleagues, with whom he held that Council,
maintained with those of different opinions, disturbing and overthrowing
thereby the seditious calumnies of heretics and schismatics in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ, who, speaking by His apostle, says,
"Forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace;" <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md)
and again, by the mouth of the same apostle, "If in anything ye be
otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you," <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) —we, I say, propose for
consideration and discussion the opinions of the holy bishops, without
violating the bond of unity and peace with them, in maintaining which we
imitate them so far as we can by the aid of the Lord Himself.
