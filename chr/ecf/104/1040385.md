<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—</span>59.  Another
Secundinus of Carpis <span id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701) said: 
"Are heretics Christians or not?  If they are Christians, why are they
not in the Church of God?  If they are not Christians, let them be made
so. <span id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702)   Else what will be the
reference in the discourse of the Lord, in which He says, ‘He that is
not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad?’ <span id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703)   Whence it is clear
that on strange children and the offspring of Antichrist the Holy Spirit
cannot descend by the laying on of hands alone, since it is clear that
heretics have not baptism." <span id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxxi-p6"></span>60.  To this we answer:  Are the
unrighteous Christians or not?  If they are Christians, why are they not
on that rock on which the Church is built? for they hear the words of
Christ and do them not.  If they are not Christians, let them be made
so.  Else what will be the reference in the discourse of our Lord, in
which He says, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that
gathereth not with me scattereth abroad?"  For they scatter His sheep
who lead them to the ruin of their lives by a false imitation of the
Lord.  Whence it is clear that upon strange children (as all the
unrighteous are called), and upon the offspring of Antichrist (which all
are who oppose themselves to Christ), the Holy Spirit cannot descend by
the laying on of hands alone, if there be not added a true conversion of
the heart; since it is clear that the unrighteous, so long as they are
unrighteous, may indeed have baptism, but cannot have the salvation of
which baptism is the sacrament.  For let us see whether heretics are
described in that psalm where the following words are used of strange
children:  "Deliver me, O Lord, from the hand of strange children, whose
mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of
falsehood:  whose sons are like young shoots well established, and their
daughters polished after the similitude of the temple.  Their garners
are full, affording all manner of store; their sheep are fruitful,
bringing forth plenteously in their streets; their oxen are strong:
there is no breaking down of their fence, no opening of a passage out,
no complaining in their streets.  Men deemed happy the people that is in
such a case; rather blessed is the people whose God is the Lord." <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705)   If, therefore, those are strange
children who place their happiness in temporal things, and in the
abundance of earthly prosperity, and despise the commandments of the
Lord, let us see whether these are not the very same of whom Cyprian so
speaks, transforming them also <span id="page_494">p. 494</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xxxi-Page_494"></span>into himself, that he may show that
he is speaking of men with whom he held communion in the sacraments: 
"In not keeping," he says, "the way of the Lord, nor observing the
heavenly commandments given us for our salvation.  Our Lord did the will
of His Father, and we do not do the will of the Lord, being eager about
our patrimony or our gains, following after pride, and so forth." <span
id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706)   But if these could both have and
transmit baptism, why is it denied that it may exist among strange
children, whom he yet exhorts, that, by keeping the heavenly
commandments conveyed to them through the only-begotten Son, they should
deserve to be His brethren and the sons of God?
