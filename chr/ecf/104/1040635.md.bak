id="v.v.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—</span>44.  For, to pass over
others dwelling in different quarters of the earth,—<span
id="page_615">p. 615</span> <span id="v.v.v.xxxviii-Page_615"></span>for
you will scarcely find any place in which this kind of men is not
represented, from whom it may appear that overseers and ministers are
wont to be condemned even in the Catholic Church,—we need not look far
to find the example of Honorius of Milevis.  But take the case of
Splendonius, whom Petilianus ordained priest after he had been condemned
in the Catholic Church, and rebaptized by himself, whose condemnation in
Gaul, communicated to us by our brethren, our colleague Fortunatus
caused to be publicly read in Constantina, and whom the same Petilianus
afterwards cast forth on experience of his abominable deceit.  From the
case of this Splendonius, when was there a time when he might not have
been reminded after what fashion wicked men are degraded from their
office even in the Catholic Church?  I wonder on what precipice of
rashness his heart was resting when he dictated those words in which he
ventured to say, "No one of you is free from guilt, where no one that is
guilty is condemned."  Wherefore the wicked, being bodily intermingled
with the good, but spiritually separated from them in the Catholic
Church, both when they are undetected through the infirmity of human
nature, and when they are condemned from considerations of discipline,
in every case bear their own burden.  And in this way those are free
from danger who are baptized by them with the baptism of Christ, if they
keep free from share in their sins either by imitation or consent;
seeing that in like manner, if they were baptized by the best of men,
they would not be justified except by Him that justifieth the ungodly: 
since to those that believe on Him that justifieth the ungodly their
faith is counted for righteousness.
