<span id="iv.viii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.viii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—In What Sense Evils are from
God.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xl-p2"></span>45.  Not only is it written in the Old
Testament, "I make good, and create evil;" <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288) but more clearly in the New Testament,
where the Lord says, "Fear not them which kill the body, and have no
more that they can do; but fear him who, after he has killed the body,
has power to cast the soul into hell." <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289)   And that to voluntary corruption
penal corruption is added in the divine judgment, is plainly declared by
the Apostle Paul, when he says, "The temple of God is holy, which temple
ye are; whoever corrupts the temple of God, him will God corrupt." <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290)   If this had been said in the Old
Law, how vehemently would the Manichæans have denounced it as making God
a corrupter!  And from fear of the word, many Latin translators make it,
"him shall God destroy," instead of corrupt, avoiding the offensive word
without any change of meaning.  Although these would inveigh against any
passage in the Old Law or the prophets if God was called in it a
destroyer.  But the Greek original here shows that corrupt is the true
word; for it is written distinctly, "Whoever corrupts the temple of God,
him will God corrupt."  If the Manichæans are asked to explain the
words, they will say, to escape making God a corrupter, that corrupt
here means to give over to corruption, or some such explanation.  Did
they read the Old Law in this spirit, they would both find many
admirable things in it; and instead of spitefully attacking passages
which they did not understand, they would reverently postpone the
inquiry.
