<span id="v.vi.xiii"></span>

<span id="v.vi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—</span>48.  But as to what they
say, arguing as follows:  If we have sinned against the Holy Ghost, in
that we have treated your baptism with contempt, why is it that you seek
us, seeing that we cannot possibly receive remission of this sin, as the
Lord says, "Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to
come?" <span id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560) —they do not perceive
that according to their interpretation of the passage none can be
delivered.  For who is there that does not speak against the Holy Ghost
and sin against him, whether we take the case of one who is not yet a
Christian, or of one who shares in the heresy of Arius, or of Eunomius,
or of Macedonius, who all say that He is a creature; or of Photinus, who
denies that He has any substance at all, saying that there is only one
God, the Father; or of any of the other heretics, whom it would now take
too long a time to mention in detail?  Are none, therefore, of these to
be delivered?  Or if the Jews themselves, against whom the Lord directed
His reproach, were to believe in Him, would they not be allowed to be
baptized? for the Saviour does not say, Shall be forgiven in baptism: 
but "Shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world
to come."

<span id="v.vi.xiii-p3"></span>49.  Let them understand, therefore, that
it is not every sin, but only some sin, against the Holy Ghost which is
incapable of forgiveness.  For just as when our Lord said, "If I had not
come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin," <span
id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561) it is clear that He did not wish it
to be understood that they would have been free from all sin, since they
were filled with many grievous sins, but that they would have been free
from some special sin, the absence of which would have left them in a
position to receive remission of all the sins which yet remained in
them, viz., the sin of not believing in Him when He came to them; for
they could not have had this sin, had He not come.  In like manner,
also, when He said, "Whosoever sinneth against the Holy Ghost,"or,
"Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost;" it is clear that He does
not refer to every sin of whatsoever kind against the Holy Ghost, in
word or deed, but would have us understand some special and peculiar
sin.  But this is the hardness of heart even to the end of this life,
which leads a man to refuse to accept remission of his sins in the unity
of the body of Christ, to which life is given by the Holy Ghost.  For
when He had said to His disciples "Receive the Holy Ghost," immediately
added, Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained." <span
id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562)   Whosoever therefore has resisted
or fought against this gift of the grace of God, or has been estranged
from it in any way whatever to the end of this mortal life, shall not
receive the remission of that sin, either in this world, or in the world
to come, seeing that it is so great a sin that in it is included every
sin; but it cannot <span id="page_651">p. 651</span> <span
id="v.vi.xiii-Page_651"></span>be proved to have been committed by any
one, till he has passed away from life.  But so long as he lives here,
"the goodness of God," as the apostle says, "is leading him to
repentance;" but if he deliberately, with the utmost perseverance in
iniquity, as the apostle adds in the succeeding verse, "after his
hardness and impenitent heart, treasures up unto himself wrath against
the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God," <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563) he shall not receive forgiveness,
neither in this world, neither in that which is to come.

<span id="v.vi.xiii-p7"></span>50.  But those with whom we are arguing,
or about whom we are arguing, are not to be despaired of, for they are
yet in the body; but they cannot seek the Holy Spirit, except in the
body of Christ, of which they possess the outward sign outside the
Church, but they do not possess the actual reality itself within the
Church of which that is the outward sign, and therefore they eat and
drink damnation to themselves. <span
id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564)   For there is but one bread which
is the sacrament of unity, seeing that, as the apostle says, "We, being
many, are one bread, and one body." <span
id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565)   Furthermore, the Catholic Church
alone is the body of Christ, of which He is the Head and Saviour of His
body. <span id="fr_2566"></span>[2567](#fn_2566)   Outside this body the
Holy Spirit giveth life to no one seeing that, as the apostle says
himself, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
which is given unto us;" <span id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567) but
he is not a partaker of the divine love who is the enemy of unity. 
Therefore they have not the Holy Ghost who are outside the Church; for
it is written of them, "They separate themselves being sensual, having
not the Spirit." <span id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568)   But
neither does he receive it who is insincerely in the Church, since this
is also the intent of what is written:  "For the Holy Spirit of
discipline will flee deceit." <span id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569)
  If any one, therefore, wishes to receive the Holy Spirit, let him
beware of continuing in alienation from the Church, let him beware of
entering it in the spirit of dissimulation; or if he has already entered
it in such wise, let him beware of persisting in such dissimulation, in
order that he may truly and indeed become united with the tree of life.

<span id="v.vi.xiii-p14"></span>51.  I have despatched to you a somewhat
lengthy epistle, which may prove burdensome among your many
occupations.  If, therefore, it may be read to you even in portions, the
Lord will grant you understanding, that you may have some answer which
you can make for the correction and healing of those men who are
commended to you as to a faithful son by our mother the Church, that you
may correct and heal them, by the aid of the Lord wherever you can, and
howsoever you can, either by speaking and replying to them in your own
person, or by bringing them into communication with the doctors of the
Church.
