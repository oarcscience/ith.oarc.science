<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.xxiii-p2"></A>Well, then, if this is so, the region of darkness is clearly touched on two sides by the region of light.&#160; And if it is touched on two sides, it must touch on two.&#160; So much for its being on one side, as we were told before.</p>   
<p class="c10"><a name="iv.viii.xxiii-p3"></A>24.&#160; And what an unseemly appearance is this of the region of light!&#8212;like a cloven arch, with a black wedge inserted below, bounded only in the direction of the cleft, and having a void space interposed where the boundless emptiness stretches above the region of darkness.&#160; Indeed, the form of the region of darkness is better than that of the region of light:&#160; for the former cleaves, the latter is cloven; the former fills the gap which is made in the latter; the former has no void in it, while the latter is undefined in all directions, except that where it is filled up by the wedge of darkness.&#160; In an ignorant and greedy notion of giving more honor to a number of pans than to a single one, so that the region of light should have six, three upwards and three downwards, they have made this region be split up, instead of sundering the other.&#160; For, according to this figure, though there may be no commixture of darkness with light, there is certainly penetration.</p>
