<span id="v.v.iv.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 57.—</span>129.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.lvii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"It is written, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery.’  Each one of you, even
though he be chaste in his body, yet in spirit is an adulterer, because
he pollutes his holiness."

<span id="v.v.iv.lvii-p2"></span>130.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.lvii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  These words also
might be spoken with truth against certain both of our number and of
yours; but if their deeds are condemned by us and you alike, they belong
to neither us nor you.  But you wish that what you say against certain
men, without proving it even in their especial case, should be taken
just as if you had established it,—not in the case of some who have
fallen away from the seed of Abraham, but in reference to all the
nations of the earth who are blessed in the seed of Abraham.
