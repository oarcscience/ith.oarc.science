have obtained from you, in accordance with my earnest endeavors, that,
laying aside from your minds all prejudice of party, you should be
impartial judges between Petilianus and myself, I will show to you that
he has not replied to what I wrote, that you may understand that he has
been compelled by lack of truth to abandon the dispute, and also see
what revilings he has allowed himself to utter against the man who so
conducted it that he had no reply to make.  And yet what I am going to
say displays itself with such manifest clearness, that, even though your
minds were estranged from me by party prejudice and personal hatred,
yet, if you would only read what is written on both sides, you could not
but confess among yourselves, in your inmost hearts, that I have spoken
truth.

of his writings, which then alone had come into my hands, without taking
any notice of his wordy and sacrilegious revilings, where he says, "Let
those men cast in our teeth our twice-repeated baptism, who, under the
name of baptism, have polluted their souls with a guilty washing; whom I
hold to be so obscene that no manner of filth is less clean than they;
whose lot it has been, by a perversion of cleanliness, to be defiled by
the water wherein they washed;" I thought that what follows was worthy
of discussion and refutation, where he says, "For what we look for is
the conscience of the giver, that the conscience of the recipient may
thereby be cleansed;" and I asked what means were to be found for
cleansing one who receives baptism when the conscience of the giver is
polluted, without the knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament
at his hands. <span id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md)
