<span id="v.iv.viii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—</span>40.  Successus of
Abbir Germaniciana <span id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666.md) said: 
"Heretics may either do nothing or everything.  If they can baptize,
they can also give the Holy Spirit; but if they cannot give the Holy
Spirit, because they do not possess the Holy Spirit, then can they not
either spiritually baptize.  Therefore we give our judgment that
heretics should be baptized." <span id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxiii-p4"></span>41.  To this we may answer almost
word for word:  Murderers may either do nothing or everything.  If they
can baptize, they can also give the Holy Spirit; but if they cannot give
the Holy Spirit, because they do not possess the Holy Spirit, then can
they not either spiritually baptize.  Therefore we give our judgment
that persons baptized by murderers, or murderers themselves who have
been baptized without being converted, should, when they have corrected
themselves, be baptized.  Yet this is not true.  For "whosoever hateth
his brother is a murderer;" <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md)
and Cyprian knew such men within the Church, who certainly baptized. 
Therefore it is to no purpose that words of this sort are used
concerning heretics.
