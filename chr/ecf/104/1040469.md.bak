<span id="v.v.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—</span>13.  But our brethren
them<span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span
id="v.v.iii.xii-Page_524"></span>selves, the sons of the aforesaid
churches, were both ignorant at the time, and still are ignorant, of
what has been done so many years ago in Africa:  wherefore they at any
rate cannot be defiled by the charges which have been brought, on the
part of the Donatists, against the Africans, without even knowing
whether they were true.  But the Donatists having openly separated and
divided themselves off, although they are even said to have taken part
in the ordination of Primianus, yet condemned the said Primianus,
ordained another bishop in opposition to Primianus, baptized outside the
communion of Primianus, rebaptized after Primianus, and returned to
Primianus with their disciples who had been baptized by themselves
outside, and never rebaptized by any one inside.  If such a union with
the party of Maximianus does not pollute the Donatists, how can the mere
report concerning the Africans pollute the foreigners?  If the lips meet
together without offense in the kiss of peace, which reciprocally
condemned each other, why is each man that is condemned by them in the
churches very far removed by the intervening sea from their
jurisdiction, not saluted with a kiss as a faithful Catholic, but driven
forth with a blast of indignation as an impious pagan?  And if, in
receiving the followers of Maximianus, they made peace in behalf of
their own unity, far be it from us to find fault with them, save that
they cut their own throats by their decision, that whereas, to preserve
unity in their schism, they collect together again what had been parted
from themselves, they yet scorn to reunite their schism itself to the
true unity of the Church.
