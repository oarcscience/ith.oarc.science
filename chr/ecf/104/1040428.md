<span id="v.iv.ix.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—</span>56.  Quintus of
Aggya <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836) said:  "He who has a
thing can give it; but what can the heretics give, who are well known to
have nothing?" <span id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xxix-p4"></span>57.  To him our answer is:  If, then,
any man can give a thing who has it, it is clear that heretics can give
baptism:  for when they separate from the Church, they have still the
sacrament of washing which they had received while in the Church; for
when they return they do not again receive it, because they had not lost
it when they withdrew from the Church.

Quintas as bishop occurs in Cypr. *Epp* lvii., lxvii., lxx., lxxi., but
this one is of Mauritania, as appears from *Epp* lxxii. 1, lxxiii. 1.
