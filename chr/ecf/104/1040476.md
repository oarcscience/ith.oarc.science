<span id="v.v.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—</span>21.  What, then, does he
mean by quoting in his letter the words with which our Lord addressed
the Jews:  "Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men,
and scribes; and some of them ye shall kill and crucify, and some of
them shall ye scourge?" <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950)   For
if by the wise men and the scribes and the prophets they would have
themselves be understood, while we were as it were the persecutors of
the prophets and wise men, why are they unwilling to speak with us,
seeing they are sent to us?  For, indeed, if the man who wrote that
epistle which we are at this present moment answering, were to be
pressed by us to acknowledge it as his own, stamping its authenticity
with his signature, I question much whether he would do it, so
thoroughly afraid are they of our possessing any words of theirs.  For
when we were anxious by some means or other to procure the latter part
of this same letter, because those from whom we obtained it were unable
to describe the whole of it, no one who was asked for it was willing to
give it to us, so soon as they knew that we were making a reply to the
portion which we had.  Therefore, when they read how the Lord says to
the prophet, "Cry aloud, spare not, and write their sins with my pen,"
 <span id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951) these men who are sent to us
as prophets have no fears on this score, but take every precaution that
their crying may not be heard by us:  which they certainly would not
fear if what they spoke of us were true.  But their apprehension is not
groundless, as it is written in the Psalm, "The mouth of them that speak
lies shall be stopped." <span id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952)   For
if the reason that they do not receive our baptism be that we are a
generation of vipers—to use the expression in his epistle—why did they
receive the baptism of the followers of Maximianus, of whom their
Council speaks in the following terms:  "Because the enfolding of a
poisoned womb has long concealed the baneful offspring of a viper’s
seed, and the moist concretions of conceived iniquity have by slow heat
flowed forth into the members of serpents"?  Is it not therefore of
themselves also that it is said in the same Council, "The poison of asps
is under their lips, their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness,
their feet are swift to shed blood; destruction and unhappiness is in
their ways, and the way of peace have they not known"? <span
id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953)   And yet they now hold these men
themselves in undiminished honor, and receive within their body those
whom these men had baptized without.
