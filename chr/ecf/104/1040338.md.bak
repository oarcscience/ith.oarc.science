<span id="v.iv.vii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—</span>15.  For the Lord
Jesus might, if He had so thought fit, have given the power of His
baptism to some one or more of His chief servants, whom He had already
made His friends, such as those to whom He says, "Henceforth I call you
not servants, but friends;" <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md)
that, as Aaron was shown to be the priest by the rod that budded, <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) so in His Church, when more and
greater miracles are performed, the ministers of more excellent
holiness, and the dispensers of His mysteries, might be made manifest by
some sign, as those who alone ought to baptize.  But if this had been
done, then though the power of baptizing were given them by the Lord,
yet it would necessarily be called their own baptism, as in the case of
the baptism of John.  And so Paul gives thanks to God that he baptized
none of those men who, as though forgetting in whose name they had been
baptized, were for dividing themselves into factions under the names of
different individuals. <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md)   For
when baptism is as valid at the hands of a contemptible man as it was
when given by an apostle, it is recognized as the baptism neither of
this man nor of that, but of Christ; as John bears witness that he
learned, in the case of the Lord Himself, through the appearance of the
dove.  For in what other respect he said, "And I knew Him not," I cannot
clearly see.  For if he had not known Him in any sense, he could not
have said to Him when He came to his baptism, "I have need to be
baptized of Thee." <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md)   What is
it, therefore, that he says, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven
like a dove, and it abode upon Him.  And I knew Him not:  but He that
sent me to baptizewith water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou
shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost?" <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md)   The dove clearly descended on Him
after He was baptized.  But while He was yet coming to be baptized, John
had said, "I have need to be baptized of Thee."  He therefore already
knew Him.  What does he therefore mean by the words, "I knew Him not: 
but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon
whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the
same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost," since this took place
after He was baptized, unless it were that he knew Him in respect of
certain attributes, and in respect of others knew Him not?  He knew Him,
indeed, as the Son of God, the Bridegroom, of whose fullness all should
receive; but whereas of His fullness he himself had so received the
power of baptizing that it should be called the baptism of John, he did
not know whether He would so give it to others also, or whether He would
have His own baptism in such wise, that at whosesoever hands it was
given, whether by a man that brought forth fruit a hundredfold, or
sixtyfold, or thirtyfold, whether by the wheat or by the chaff, it
should be known to be of Him alone; and this he learned through the
Spirit descending like a dove, and abiding on Him.
