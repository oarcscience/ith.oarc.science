<span id="iv.viii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.viii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—God Alone Perfectly
Good.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xxxviii-p2"></span>42.  What harm, you ask, would
follow if those things too were perfectly good?  Still, should any one,
who admits and believes the perfect goodness of God the Father, inquire
what source we should reverently assign to any other perfectly good
thing, supposing it to exist, our only correct reply would be, that it
is of God the Father, who is perfectly good.  And we must bear in mind
that what is of Him is born of Him, and not made by Him out of nothing,
and that it is therefore perfectly, that is, incorruptibly, good like
God Himself.  So we see that it is unreasonable to require that things
made out of nothing should be as perfectly good as He who was begotten
of God Himself, and who is one as God is one, otherwise God would have
begotten something unlike Himself.  Hence it shows ignorance and impiety
to seek for brethren for this only-begotten Son through whom all good
things were made by the Father out of nothing, except in this, that He
condescended to appear as man.  Accordingly in Scripture He is called
both only-begotten and first-begotten; only-begotten of the Father, and
first-begotten from the dead.  "And we beheld," says John, "His glory,
the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and
truth." <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md)   And Paul says, "that
He might be the first-born among many brethren." <span
id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xxxviii-p5"></span>43.  But should we say, These
things made out of nothing are not good things, but only God’s nature is
good, we shall be unjust to good things of great value.  And there is
impiety in calling it a defect in anything not to be what God is, and in
denying a thing to be good because it is inferior to God.  Pray submit
then, thou nature of the rational soul, to be somewhat less than God,
but only so far less, that after Him nothing else is above thee. 
Submit, I say, and yield to Him, lest He drive thee still lower into
depths where the punishment inflicted will continually detract more and
more from the good which thou hast.  Thou exaltest thyself against God,
if thou art indignant at His preceding thee; and thou art very
contumacious in thy thoughts of Him, if thou dost not rejoice
unspeakably in the possession of this good, that He alone is above
thee.  This being settled as certain, thou art not to say, God should
have made me the only nature:  there should be no good thing after me. 
It could not be that the next good thing to God should be the last.  And
in this is seen most clearly how great dignity God conferred on thee,
that He who in the order of nature alone rules over thee, made other
good things for thee to rule over.  Nor be surprised that they are not
now in all respects subject to thee, and that sometimes they pain thee;
for thy Lord has greater authority over the things subject to thee than
thou hast, as a master over the servants of his servants.  What wonder,
then, if, when thou sinnest, that is, disobeyest thy Lord, the things
thou before ruledst over are made instrumental in thy punishment?  For
what is so just, or what is more just than God?  For this befell human
nature in Adam, of whom this is not the place to speak.  Suffice it to
say, the righteous Ruler acts in character both in just rewards and in
just punishments, in the happiness of those who live rightly, and in the
penalty inflicted on sinners.  Nor yet art thou <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) left without mercy, since by an
appointed distribution of things and times thou art called to return. 
Thus the righteous control of the supreme Creator extends even to
earthly good things, which are corrupted and restored, that thou
mightest have consolations mingled with punishments; that thou mightest
both praise God when delighted by the order of good things, and mightest
take refuge in Him when tried by experience of evils.  So, as far as
earthly things are subject to thee, they teach thee that thou art their
ruler; as far as they distress thee, they teach thee to be subject to
thy Lord.
