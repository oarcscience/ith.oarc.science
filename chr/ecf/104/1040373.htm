 said:&#160; "As when the blind leads the blind, both fall into the ditch,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1653"></A><A HREF="#fn_1653"><FONT SIZE="1">1654</FONT></A>
 so when a heretic baptizes a heretic, both fall together into death."</p>  
<p class="c10"><a name="v.iv.viii.xix-p4"></A>33.&#160; This is true, but it does not follow that what he adds is true.&#160; "And therefore," he says, "the heretic must be baptized and brought to life, lest we who are alive should hold communion with the dead."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1654"></A><A HREF="#fn_1654"><FONT SIZE="1">1655</FONT></A>
&#160; Were they not dead who said, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1655"></A><A HREF="#fn_1655"><FONT SIZE="1">1656</FONT></A>
 for they did not believe in the resurrection of the dead.&#160; Those then who were corrupted by their evil communications, and followed them, were not they likewise falling with them into the pit?&#160; And yet among them there were men to whom the apostle was writing as being already baptized; nor would they, therefore, if they were corrected, be baptized afresh.&#160; Does not the same apostle say, "To be carnally-minded is death?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1656"></A><A HREF="#fn_1656"><FONT SIZE="1">1657</FONT></A>
 and certainly the covetous, the deceivers, the robbers, in the midst of whom Cyprian himself was groaning, were carnally-minded.&#160; What then?&#160; Did the dead hurt him who was living in unity?&#160; Or who would say, that because such men had or gave the baptism of Christ, that it was therefore violated by their iniquities?</p>
