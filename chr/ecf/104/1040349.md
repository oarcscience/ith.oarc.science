<span id="v.iv.vii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—</span>34.  I remember that I
have already discussed at sufficient length the question of "the temple
of God," and how this saying is to be taken, "As many of you as have
been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md)   For neither are the covetous the
temple of God, since it is written, "What agreement hath the temple of
God with idols?" <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md)   And
Cyprian has adduced the testimony of Paul to the fact that covetousness
is idolatry.  But men put on Christ, sometimes so far as to receive the
sacrament, sometimes so much further as to receive holiness of life. 
And the first of these is common to good and bad alike; the second,
peculiar to the good and pious.  Wherefore, if "baptism cannot be
without the Spirit," then heretics have the Spirit also,—but to
destruction, not to salvation, just as was the case with Saul. <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md)   For in the Holy Spirit devils are
cast out through the name of Christ, which even he was able to do who
was without the Church, which called forth a suggestion from the
disciples to their Lord. <span id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md)  
Just as the covetous have the Holy Spirit, who yet are not the temple of
God.  For "what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?"  If
therefore the covetous have not the Spirit of God, and yet have baptism,
it is possible for baptism to exist without the Spirit of God.

<span id="v.iv.vii.xxiv-p6"></span>35.  If therefore heresy is rendered
"unable to engender sons to God through Christ, because it is not the
bride of Christ," <span id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) neither can
that crowd of evil men established within the Church, since it is also
not the bride of Christ; for the bride of Christ is described as being
without spot or wrinkle. <span id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md)  
Therefore either not all baptized persons are the sons of God, or even
that which is not the bride can engender the sons of God.  But as it is
asked whether "he is spiritually born who has received the baptism of
Christ in the midst of heretics," <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) so it may be asked whether he is
spiritually born who has received the baptism of Christ in the Catholic
Church, without being turned to God in a true heart, of whom it cannot
be said that he has not received baptism.
