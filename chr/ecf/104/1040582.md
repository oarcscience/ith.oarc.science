<span id="v.v.iv.xcv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xcv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 95.—</span>216.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xcv-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"If you wish that we should be your friends, why do you drag us to you
against our will?  But if you wish that we should be your foes, why do
you kill your foes?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xcv-p2"></span>217.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xcv-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  We neither drag
you to us against your will, nor do we kill our foes; but whatever we do
in our dealings with you, though we may do it contrary to your
inclination, yet we do it from our love to you, that you may voluntarily
correct yourselves, and live an amended life.  For no one lives against
his will; and yet a boy, in order to learn this lesson of his own free
will, <span id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260.md) is beaten contrary to
his inclination, and that often by the very man that is most dear to
him.  And this, indeed, is what the kings would desire to say to you if
they were to strike you, for to this end their power has been ordained
of God.  But you cry out even when they are not striking you.

ut hoc volens discat, invitus vapulat*.  Perhaps a better reading is,
*"Nam nemo vult invitus; et tamen puer ut volens discat,"* etc., leaving
out *"hoc,"* which is wanting in the Fleury <span class="c11"><span

will; and yet a boy, wishing to learn, is beaten against his will."
