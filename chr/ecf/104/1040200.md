id="iv.x.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Privations in Things are
Fittingly Ordered by God.</span>

<span id="iv.x.xviii-p2"></span>Yet even these privations of things are
so ordered in the universe of nature, that to those wisely considering
they not unfittingly have their vicissitudes.  For by not illuminating
certain places and times, God has also made the darkness as fittingly as
the day.  For if we by restraining the voice fittingly interpose silence
in speaking, how much more does He, as the perfect framer of all things,
fittingly make privations of things?  Whence also in the hymn of the
three children, light and darkness alike praise God, <span

hearts of those who well consider.
