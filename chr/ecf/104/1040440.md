<span id="v.iv.ix.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—</span>80.  Honoratus of
Tucca <span id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864) said:  "Since Christ is
the truth, we ought to follow the truth rather than custom; that we may
sanctify by the baptism of the Church the heretics who come to us,
simply because they could receive nothing outside." <span
id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xli-p4"></span>81.  This man, too, is a witness to the
custom, in which he gives us the greatest assistance, whatever else he
may appear to say against us.  But this is not the reason why heretics
come over to us, because they have received nothing outside, but that
what they did receive may begin to be of use to them:  for this it could
not be outside in any wise.
