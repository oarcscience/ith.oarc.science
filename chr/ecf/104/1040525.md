<span id="v.v.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—</span>90.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxxviii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span>
said:  "If you declare that you hold the Catholic Church, the word
‘catholic’ is merely the Greek equivalent for entire or whole.  But it
is clear that you are not in the whole, because you have gone aside into
the part."

<span id="v.v.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span>91.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxviii-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  I too indeed
have attained to a very slight knowledge of the Greek language, scarcely
to be called knowledge at all, yet I am not shameless in saying that I
know that <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxviii-p2.2"></span>ὅλον</span> means not "one," but "the
whole;" and that <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxxviii-p2.3"></span>καθ’ ὅλον</span> means "according to the
whole:"  whence the Catholic Church received its name, according to the
saying of the Lord, "It is not for you to know the times, which the
Father hath put in His own power.  But ye shall receive power, after
that the Holy Ghost is come upon you:  and ye shall be witnesses unto me
both in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole
earth." <span id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100)   Here you have the
<span id="page_555">p. 555</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.xxxviii-Page_555"></span>origin of the name "Catholic."  But
you are so bent upon running with your eyes shut against the mountain
which grew out of a small stone, according to the prophecy of Daniel,
and filled the whole earth, <span id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101)
that you actually tell us that we have gone aside into a part, and are
not in the whole among those whose communion is spread throughout the
whole earth.  But just in the same way as, supposing you were to say
that I was Petilianus, I should not be able to find any method of
refuting you unless I were to laugh at you as being in jest, or mourn
over you as being mad, so in the present case I see that I have no other
choice but this; and since I do not believe that you are in jest, you
see what alternative remains.
