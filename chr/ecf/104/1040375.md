<span id="v.iv.viii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.viii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—</span>36.  Theogenes of
Hippo Regius <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659) said: 
"According to the sacrament of the heavenly grace of God which we have
received, we believe in the one only baptism which is in the holy
Church." <span id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660)

<span id="v.iv.viii.xxi-p4"></span>37.  This may be my own judgment
also.  For it is so balanced, that it contains nothing contrary to the
truth.  For we also believe in the one only baptism which is in the holy
Church.  Had he said, indeed, We believe in that which is in the holy
Church alone, the same answer must have been made to him as to the
rest.  But as it is, since he has expressed himself in this wise, "We
believe in the one only baptism which is in the holy Church," so that it
is asserted that it exists in the holy Church, but not denied that it
may be elsewhere as well, whatever his meaning may have been, there is
no need to argue against these words.  For if I were ques<span
id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span
id="v.iv.viii.xxi-Page_489"></span>tioned on the several points, first,
whether there was one baptism, I should answer that there was one.  Then
if I were asked, whether this was in the holy Church, I should answer
that it was.  In the third place, if it were asked whether I believed in
this baptism, I should answer that I did so believe; and consequently I
should answer that I believed in the one baptism which is in the holy
Church.  But if it were asked whether it was found in the holy Church
alone, and not among heretics and schismatics, I should answer that, in
common with the whole Church, I believed the contrary.  But since he did
not insert this in his judgment, I should consider that it was mere
wantonness if I added words which I did not find there, for the sake of
arguing against them.  For if he were to say, There is one water of the
river Euphrates, which is in Paradise, no one could gainsay the truth of
what he said.  But if he were asked whether that water were in Paradise
and nowhere else, and were to say that this was so, he would be saying
what was false.  For, besides Paradise, it is also in those lands into
which it flows from that source.  But who is rash enough to say that he
would have been likely to assert what is false, when it is quite
possible that he was asserting what is true?  Wherefore the words of
this judgment require no contradiction, because they in no wise run
counter to the truth.
