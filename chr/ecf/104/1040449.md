<span id="v.iv.ix.l-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50.—</span>98.  It is indeed worth
while to consider the whole of the passage in the aforesaid letter to
Magnus, which he has put together as follows:  "Not dwelling," he says,
"in the house of God—that is to say, in the Church of Christ—in which
none dwell save those that are of one heart and of one mind, as the Holy
Spirit says in the Psalms, speaking of ‘God that maketh men to be of one
mind in an house.’  <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895)  
Finally, the very sacrifices of the Lord declare that Christians are
united among themselves by a firm and inseparable love for one another. 
For when the Lord calls bread, which is compacted together by the union
of many grains, His body, <span id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896) He
is signifying one people, whom He bore, compacted into one body; and
when He calls wine, which is pressed out from a multitude of branches
and clusters and brought together into one, His blood, <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897) He also signifies one flock joined
together by the mingling of a multitude united into one."  These words
of the blessed Cyprian show that he both understood and loved the glory
of the house of God, which house he asserted to consist of those who are
of one heart and of one mind, proving it by the testimony of the
prophets and the meaning of the sacraments, and in which house certainly
were not found those envious persons, those malevolent without charity,
who nevertheless used to baptize.  From whence it is clear that the
sacrament of Christ can both be in and be administered by those who are
not in the Church of Christ, in which Cyprian himself bears witness that
there are none dwelling save those who are of one heart and of one
mind.  Nor can it indeed be said that they are allowed to baptize so
long as they are undetected, seeing that the Apostle Paul did not fail
to detect those of whose ministry he bears unquestionable testimony in
his epistle, saying that he rejoices that they also were proclaiming
Christ.  For he says of them, "Whether in pretense or in truth, Christ
is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice." <span
