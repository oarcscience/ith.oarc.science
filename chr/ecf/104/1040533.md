<span id="v.v.iv.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46.—</span>107.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xlvi-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"In the first Psalm David separates the blessed from the impious, not
indeed making them into parties, but excluding all the impious from
holiness.  ‘Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners.’  Let him who had strayed
from the path of righteousness, so that he should perish, return to it
again.  ‘Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.’ <span
id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123)   When he gives this warning, O ye
miserable men, why do you sit in that seat?  ‘But his delight is in the
law of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day and night.  And he
shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth
his fruit in his season:  his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever
he doeth shall prosper.  The ungodly are not so:  but are like the chaff
which the wind driveth away.’  He blindeth their eyes, so that they
should not see.  ‘Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.  For the Lord knoweth
the way of the righteous:  but the way of the ungodly shall
perish.’" <span id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124)

<span id="v.v.iv.xlvi-p4"></span>108.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xlvi-p4.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Who is there in
the Scriptures that would not distinguish between these two classes of
men?  But you slanderously charge the corn with the offenses of the
chaff; and being yourselves mere chaff, you boast yourselves to be the
only corn.  But the true prophets declare that both these classes have
been mingled together throughout the whole world, that is, throughout
the whole corn-field of the Lord, until the winnowing which is to take
place on the day of judgment.  But I advise you to read that first Psalm
in the Greek version, and then you will not venture to reproach the
whole world with being of the party of Macarius; because you will
perhaps come to understand of what Macarius there is a party among all
the saints, who throughout all nations are blessed in the seed of
Abraham.  For what stands in our language as "Blessed is the man," is in
Greek <span class="Greek"><span id="v.v.iv.xlvi-p4.2"></span>Μαχάριος
ἀνήρ</span>.  But that Macarius who offends you, if he is a bad man,
neither belongs to this division, nor is to its prejudice.  But if he is
a good man, let him prove his own work, that he may have glory in
himself alone, and not in another. <span
