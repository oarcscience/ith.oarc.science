<span id="iv.viii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.viii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Of the Number of Natures in the
Manichæan Fiction.</span>

<span id="iv.viii.xxv-p2"></span>26.  Again, I wish to know, when I read
of God the Father and His kingdoms founded on the shining and happy
region, whether the Father and His kingdoms, and the region, are all of
the same nature and substance.  If they are, then it is not another
nature or sort of body of God which the wedge of the race of darkness
cleaves and penetrates, which itself is an unspeakably revolting thing,
but it is actually the very nature of God which undergoes this.  Think
of this, I beseech you:  as you are men, think of it, and flee from it;
and if by tearing open your breasts you can cast out by the roots such
profane fancies from your faith, I pray you to do it.  Or will you say
that these three are not of one and the same nature, but that the Father
is of one, the kingdoms of another, and the region of another, so that
each has a peculiar nature and substance, and that they are arranged
according to their degree of excellence?  If this is true, Manichæus
should have taught that there are four natures, not two; or if the
Father and the kingdoms have one nature, and the region only one of its
own, he should have made three.  Or if he made only two, because the
region of darkness does not belong to God, in what sense does the region
of light belong to God?  For if it has a nature of its own, and if God
neither generated nor made it, it does not belong to Him, and the seat
of His kingdom is in what belongs to another.  Or if it belongs to Him
because of its vicinity, the region of darkness must do so too; for it
not only borders on the region of light, but penetrates it so as to
sever it in two.  Again, if God generated it, it cannot have a separate
nature.  For what is generated by God must be what God is, as the
Catholic Church believes of the only begotten Son.  So you are brought
back of necessity to that shocking and detestable profanity, that the
wedge of darkness sunders not a region distinct and separate from God,
but the very nature of God.  Or if God did not generate, but make it, of
what did He make it?  Or if of Himself, what is this but to generate? 
If of some other nature, was this nature good or evil?  If good, there
must have been some good nature not belonging to God; which you will
scarcely have the boldness to assert.  If evil, the race of darkness
cannot have been the only evil nature.  Or did God take a part of that
region and turn it into a region of light, in order to found His kingdom
upon it?  If He had, He would have taken the whole, and there would have
been no evil nature left.  If God, then, did not make the region of
light of a substance distinct from His own, He must have made it of
nothing. <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md)
