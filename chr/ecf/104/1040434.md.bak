<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.ix.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—</span>68. Pudentianus of
Cuiculi <span id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) said:  "My recent
ordination to the episcopate induced me, brethren, to wait and hear what
my elders would decide.  For it is plain that heresies have and can have
nothing; and so, if any come from them, it is determined righteously
that they should be baptized." <span

<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxv-p4"></span>69.  As, therefore, we have already
answered those who went before, for whose judgment this man was waiting,
so be it understood that we have answered himself.
