<span id="v.v.iv.vii"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—1</span>4.  <span
class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.vii-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"And again, ‘He who is baptized by one that is dead, his washing
profiteth him nothing.’ <span id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md)   He
did not mean that the baptizer was a corpse, a lifeless body, the
remains of a man ready for burial, but one lacking the Spirit of God,
who is compared to a dead body, as He declares to a disciple in another
place, ac<span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span
id="v.v.iv.vii-Page_532"></span>cording to the witness of the gospel. 
For His disciple says, ‘Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 
But Jesus said unto him, Follow me, and let the dead bury their
dead.’ <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md)   The father of the
disciple was not baptized.  He declared him as a pagan to belong to the
company of pagans; unless he said this of the unbelieving, The dead
cannot bury the dead.  He was dead, therefore, not as smitten by some
death, but as smitten even during life.  For he who so lives as to be
doomed to eternal death is tortured by a death in life.  To be baptized,
therefore, by the dead, is to have received not life but death.  We must
therefore consider and declare how far the *traditor* is to be accounted
dead while yet alive.  He is dead who has not deserved to be born again
with a true baptism; he is likewise dead who, having been born again
with a true baptism, has become involved with a *traditor*.  Both are
wanting in the life of baptism,—both he who never had it at all, and he
who had it and has lost it.  For the Lord Jesus Christ says, ‘There
shall come to that man seven spirits more wicked than the former one,
and the last state of that man shall be worse than the first.’" <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978.md)

<span id="v.v.iv.vii-p5"></span>15.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.vii-p5.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  Seek with greater
care to know in what sense the words which you have quoted from
Scripture in proof of your position were really uttered, and how they
should be understood.  For that all unrighteous persons are wont to be
called dead in a mystical sense is clear enough; but Christ, to whom
true baptism belongs, which you say is false because of the faults of
men, is alive, sitting at the right hand of the Father, and He will not
die any more through any infirmity of the flesh:  death will no more
have dominion over Him. <span id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979.md)   And
they who are baptized with His baptism are not baptized by one who is
dead.  And if it so happen that certain ministers, being deceitful
workers, seeking their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s,
proclaiming the gospel not in purity, and preaching Christ of contention
and envy, are to be called dead because of their unrighteousness, yet
the sacrament of the living God does not die even in one that is dead. 
For that Simon was dead who was baptized by Philip in Samaria, who
wished to purchase the gift of God for money; but the baptism which he
had lived in him still to work his punishment. <span
id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980.md)

<span id="v.v.iv.vii-p8"></span>16.  But how false the statement is
which you make, that "both are wanting in the life of baptism, both he
who never had it at all, and he who had it and has lost it," you may see
from this, that in the case of those who apostatize after having been
baptized, and who return through penitence, baptism is not restored to
them, as it would be restored if it were lost.  In what manner, indeed,
do your dead men baptize according to your interpretation?  Must we not
reckon the drunken among the dead (to say nothing of the rest, and to
mention only what is well known and of daily experience among all),
seeing that the apostle says of the widow, "But she that liveth in
pleasure is dead while she liveth?" <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981.md)   In the next place, in that
Council of yours, in which you condemned Maximianus with his advisers or
his ministers, have you forgotten with what eloquence you said, "Even
after the manner of the Egyptians, the shores are full of the bodies of
the dying, on whom the weightier punishment falls in death itself, in
that, after their life has been wrung from them by the avenging waters,
they have not found so much as burial?"  And yet you yourselves may see
whether or no one of them, Felicianus, has been brought to life again;
yet he has with him within the communion of your body those whom he
baptized outside.  As therefore he is baptized by One that is alive, who
is clothed with the baptism of the living Christ, so he is baptized by
the dead who is wrapped in the baptism of the dead Saturn, or any one
like him; that we may set forth in the meanwhile, with what brevity we
may, in what sense the words which you have quoted may be understood
without any cavilling on the part of any one of us.  For, in the sense
in which they are received by you, you make no effort to explain them,
but only strive to entangle us together with yourselves.
