Rusiccade <span id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848) said:  "A man that
is a heretic cannot give that which he has not; much more is this the
case with a schismatic, who has lost what he had." <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849)

<span id="v.iv.ix.xxxiv-p4"></span>67.  We have already shown that they
still have it, because they do not lose it when they separate
themselves.  For they do not re<span id="page_508">p. 508</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix.xxxiv-Page_508"></span>ceive it again when they return: 
wherefore, if it was thought that they could not give it because they
were supposed not to have it, let it now be understood that they can
give it, because it is understood that they also have it.
