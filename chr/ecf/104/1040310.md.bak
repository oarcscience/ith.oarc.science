<span id="v.iv.vi.xii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> 12.—19.  But he urges that
"we find that the apostles, in all their epistles, execrated and
abhorred the sacrilegious wickedness of heretics, so as to say that
‘their word does spread as a canker.’" <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md)   What then?  Does not Paul also
show that those who said, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,"
were corrupters of good manners by their evil communications, adding
immediately afterwards, "Evil communications corrupt good manners;" and
yet he intimated that these were within the Church when he says, "How
say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?" <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md)   But when does he fail to express
his abhorrence of the covetous?  Or could anything be said in stronger
terms, than that covetousness should be called idolatry, as the same
apostle declared? <span id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md)   Nor did
Cyprian understand his language otherwise, inserting it when need
required in his letters; though he confesses that in his time there were
in the Church not covetous men of an ordinary type, but robbers <span
id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span id="v.iv.vi.xii-Page_455"></span>and
usurers, and these found not among the masses, but among the bishops. 
And yet I should be willing to understand that those of whom the apostle
says, "Their word does spread as a canker," were without the Church, but
Cyprian himself will not allow me.  For, when showing, in his letter to
Antonianus, <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md) that no man ought
to sever himself from the unity of the Church before the time of the
final separation of the just and unjust, merely because of the admixture
of evil men in the Church, when he makes it manifest how holy he was,
and deserving of the illustrious martyrdom which he won, he says, "What
swelling of arrogance it is, what forgetfulness of humility and
gentleness, that any one should dare or believe that he can do what the
Lord did not grant even to the apostles,—to think that he can
distinguish the tares from the wheat, or, as if it were granted to him
to carry the fan and purge the floor, to endeavor to separate the chaff
from the grain!  And whereas the apostle says, ‘But in a great house
there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and
of earth,’ <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) that he should
seem to choose those of gold and of silver, and despise and cast away
and condemn those of wood and of earth, when really the vessels of wood
are only to be burned in the day of the Lord by the burning of the
divine conflagration, and those of earth are to be broken by Him to whom
the ‘rod of iron <span id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) has been
given.’" <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md)   By this argument,
therefore, against those who, under the pretext of avoiding the society
of wicked men, had severed themselves from the unity of the Church,
Cyprian shows that by the great house of which the apostle spoke, in
which there were not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of
wood and of earth, he understood nothing else but the Church, in which
there should be good and bad, till at the last day it should be cleansed
as a threshing-floor by the winnowing-fan.  And if this be so, in the
Church herself, that is, in the great house itself, there were vessels
to dishonor, whose word did spread like a canker.  For the apostle,
speaking of them, taught as follows:  "And their word," he says, "will
spread as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus; who
concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past
already; and overthrow the faith of some.  Nevertheless the foundation
of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are
His.  And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from
iniquity.  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and
of silver, but also of wood and of earth." <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md)   If, therefore, they whose words
did spread as doth a canker were as it were vessels to dishonor in the
great house, and by that "great house" Cyprian understands the unity of
the Church itself, surely it cannot be that their canker polluted the
baptism of Christ.  Accordingly, neither without, any more than within,
can any one who is of the devil’s party, either in himself or in any
other person, stain the sacrament which is of Christ.  It is not,
therefore, the case that "the word which spreads as a canker to the ears
of those who hear it gives remission of sins;" <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md) but when baptism is given in the
words of the gospel, however great be the perverseness of understanding
on the part either of him through whom, or of him to whom it is given,
the sacrament itself is holy in itself on account of Him whose sacrament
it is.  And if any one, receiving it at the hands of a misguided man,
yet does not receive the perversity of the minister, but only the
holiness of the mystery, being closely bound to the unity of the Church
in good faith and hope and charity, he receives remission of his
sins,—not by the words which do eat as doth a canker, but by the
sacraments of the gospel flowing from a heavenly source.  But if the
recipient himself be misguided, on the one hand, what is given is of no
avail for the salvation of the misguided man; and yet, on the other
hand, that which is received remains holy in the recipient, and is not
renewed to him if he be brought to the right way.

252 <span class="c11"><span id="v.iv.vi.xii-p5.1"></span>A.D.</span>, to
Cyprian, favoring his milder view in opposition to the purism of
Novatian:  subsequently Novatian wrote to him, advocating the purist
movement and impugning the laxity of Cornelius, bp. of Rome.  To
overthrow the effect upon A. of this letter, Cyprian wrote Epistle LV.
