class="c11"><span id="v.v.iv.xxix-p1.2"></span>Petilianus</span> said: 
"But to pass rapidly through these minor points:  can he be said to lay
down the law who is not a magistrate of the court? or is what he lays
down to be considered law, when in the character of a private person he
disturbs public rights?  Is it not rather the case that he not only
involves himself in guilt, but is held to be a forger, and that which he
composes a forgery?"

<span id="v.v.iv.xxix-p2"></span>67.  <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.iv.xxix-p2.1"></span>Augustin</span> answered:  What if your
private person, whom you deem a forger, were to set forth to any one the
law of the emperor?  Would not the man, when he had compared it with the
law of those who have the genuine law, and found it to be identically
the same, lay aside all care about the source from which he had obtained
it, and consider only what he had obtained?  For what the forger gives
is false when he gives it of his own falseness; but when something true
is given by any person, even though he be a forger, yet, although the
giver be not truthful, the gift is notwithstanding true.
