<span id="v.iv.vii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—</span>37.  To go on to what
he says, "that a bishop should be ‘teachable,’" <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) adding, "But he is teachable who is
gentle and meek to learn; for a bishop ought not only to teach, but to
learn as well, since he is indeed the better teacher who daily grows and
advances by learning better things;" <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) —in these words assuredly the holy
man, endowed with pious charity, sufficiently points out that we should
not hesitate to read his letters in such a sense, that we should feel no
difficulty if the Church should afterwards confirm what had been
discovered by further and longer discussions; because, as there were
many things which the learned Cyprian might teach, so there was still
something which the teachable Cyprian might learn.  But the admonition
that he gives us, "that we should go back to the fountain, that is, to
apostolic tradition, and thence turn the channel of truth to our
times," <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) is most excellent,
and should be followed without hesitation.  It is handed down to us,
therefore, as he himself records, by the apostles, that there is "one
God, and one Christ, and one hope, and one faith, and one Church, and
one baptism." <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md)   Since then we
find that in the times of the apostles themselves there were some who
had not the one hope, but had the one baptism, the truth is so brought
down to us from the fountain itself, that it is clear to us that it is
possible that though there is one Church, as there is one hope, and one
baptism, they may yet have the one baptism who have not the one Church;
just as even in those early times it was possible that men should have
the one baptism who had not the one hope.  For how had they one hope
with the holy and the just, who used to say, "Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die," <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) asserting
that there was no resurrection of the dead?  And yet they were among the
very men to whom the same apostle says, "Was Paul crucified for you? or
were you baptized in the name of Paul?" <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md)   For he writes most manifestly to
them, saying, "How say some among you that there is no resurrection of
the dead?" <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md)
