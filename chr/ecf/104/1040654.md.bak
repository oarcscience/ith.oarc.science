<span id="v.v.v.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.v.v.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 57.—</span>69.  Furthermore, if,
while I have continued without intermission to prove how entirely the
passages of Scripture which Petilianus has quoted against us have failed
to hurt our cause, he himself has in some cases not touched at all what
I have quoted, and partly, when he has endeavored to handle them, has
shown that the only thing that he could do was to fail in finding an
escape from them, you require no long exhortation or advice in order to
see what you ought to maintain, and what you should avoid.  But it may
be that this has been the kind of show that he has made in dealing with
the testimony of holy Scripture, but that he has not been without force
in the case of the documentary evidence found in the records of the
schism itself.  Let us then see in the case of these too, though it is
superfluous to inquire into them after testimony from the word of God,
what he has quoted, or what he has proved.  For, after pouring forth a
violent invective against *traditors*, and quoting loudly many passages
against them from the holy books themselves, he yet said nothing which
could prove his opponents to be *traditors*.  But I quoted the case of
Silvanus of Cirta, who held his own see some little time before himself,
who was expressly declared in the Municipal Chronicles to have been a
*traditor* while he was yet a sub-deacon.  Against this fact he did not
venture to whisper a syllable.  And yet you cannot fail to see how
strong the pressure was which must have been urging him to reply that he
might show a man, who was his predecessor, not only one of his party,
but a partner, so to speak, in his see, to have been innocent of the
crime of delivering up the sacred books, especially as you rest the
whole strength of your cause on the fact that you give the name of
*traditor* to all whom you either pretend or believe to have been the
successors of *traditors* in the path of their communion.  Although,
then, the very exigencies of your cause would seem to compel him to
undertake the defence of a citizen even of Russicadia, or Calama, or any
other city of your <span id="page_627">p. 627</span> <span
id="v.v.v.lvii-Page_627"></span>party, whom I should declare to be a
*traditor*, on the authority of the Municipal Chronicles, yet he did not
open his mouth even in defense of his own predecessor.  For what reason,
except that he could not find any mist dark enough to deceive the minds
of even the slowest and sleepiest of men?  For what could he have said,
except that the charges brought against Silvanus were false?  But we
quote the words of the Chronicles, both as to the date of the fact, and
as to the time of the information laid before Zenophilus the
ex-consul. <span id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md)   And how could he
resist this evidence, being encompassed on every side by the most
excellent cause of the Catholics, while yours was bad as bad could be? 
For which reason I quote these words from my epistle to which he would
fain be thought to have replied in this which I am now refuting, that
you may see for yourselves how impregnable the position must be against
which he has been able to find no safer weapon than silence.
