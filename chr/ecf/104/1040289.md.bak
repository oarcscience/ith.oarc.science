<span id="v.iv.v.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv.v.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—</span>16.  But Cyprian was right
in not being moved by what Jubaianus wrote, that "the followers of
Novatian <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md) rebaptize those who
come to them from the Catholic Church." <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md)   For, in the first place, it does
not follow that whatever heretics have done in a perverse spirit of
mimicry, Catholics are therefore to abstain from doing, because the
heretics do the same.  And again, the reasons are different for which
heretics and the Catholic Church ought respectively to abstain from
rebaptizing.  For it would not be right for heretics to do so, even if
it were fitting in the Catholic Church; because their argument is, that
among the Catholics is wanting that which they themselves received
whilst still within the pale, and took away with them when they
departed.  Whereas the reason why the Catholic Church should not
administer again the baptism which was given among heretics, is that it
may not seem to decide that a power which is Christ’s alone belongs to
its members, or to pronounce that to be wanting in the heretics which
they have received within her pale, and certainly could not lose by
straying outside.  For thus much Cyprian himself, with all the rest,
established, that if any should return from heresy to the Church, they
should be received back, not by baptism, but by the discipline of
penitence; whence it is clear that they cannot be held to lose by their
secession what is not restored to them when they return.  Nor ought it
for a moment to be said that, as their heresy is their own, as their
error is their own, as the sacrilege of disunion is their own, so also
the baptism is their own, which is really Christ’s.  Accordingly, while
the evils which are their own are corrected when they return, so in that
which is not theirs His presence should be recognised, from whom it is.
