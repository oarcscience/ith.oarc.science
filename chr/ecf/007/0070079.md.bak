#### <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXVIII.—Of True Religion and of Nature. Whether Fortune is a Goddess, and of Philosophy.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p1"></span>Wherefore there is nothing else
in life on which our plan and condition can depend but the knowledge of
God who created us, and the religious and pious worship of Him; and
since the philosophers have wandered from this, it is plain that they
were not wise. They sought wisdom, indeed; but because they did not seek
it in a right manner, they sunk down to a greater distance, and fell
into such great errors, that they did not even possess common wisdom.
For they were not only unwilling to maintain religion, but they even
took it away; while, led on by the appearance of false virtue, they
endeavour to free the mind from all fear: and this overturning of
religion gains the name of nature. For they, either being ignorant by
whom the world was made, or wishing to persuade men that nothing was
completed by divine intelligence, said that nature was the mother of all
things, as though they should say that all things were produced of their
own accord: by which word they altogether confess their own ignorance.
For nature, apart from divine providence and power, is absolutely
nothing. But if they call God nature, what perverseness is it, to use
the name of nature rather than of God! <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) But if nature is the plan, or
necessity, or condition of birth, it is not by itself capable of
sensation; but there must necessarily be a divine mind, which by its
foresight furnishes the beginning of their existence to all things. Or
if nature is heaven and earth, and everything which is created, nature
is not God, but the work of God.  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p3"></span>By a similar error they believe
in the existence of fortune, as a goddess mocking the affairs of then
with various casualties, because they know not from what source things
good and evil happen <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-Page_98"></span>to them. They think that they are
brought together to do battle with her; nor do they assign any reason by
whom and on what account they are thus matched; but they only boast that
they are every moment carrying on a contest for life and death with
fortune. Now, as many as have consoled any persons on account of the
death and removal of friends, have censured the name of fortune with the
most severe accusations; nor is there any disputation of theirs on the
subject of virtue, in which fortune is not harassed. <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p3.1"></span>M. Tullius, in his <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p3.2"></span>Consolation, says that he has always
fought against fortune, and that she was always overpowered by him when
he had valiantly beaten back the attacks of his enemies; that he was not
subdued by her even then, when he was driven from his home and deprived
of his country; but then, when he lost his dearest daughter, he
shamefully confesses that he is overcome by fortune. I yield, he says,
and raise my hand. <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) What is more
wretched than this man, who thus lies prostrate? He acts foolishly, he
says; but it is one who professes that he is wise. What, then, does the
assumption of the name imply? What that contempt of things which is laid
claim to with magnificent words? What that dress, so different from
others? Or why do you give precepts of wisdom at all, if no one has yet
been found who is wise? And does any one bear ill-will to us because we
deny that philosophers are wise, when they themselves confess that they
neither have knowledge nor wisdom? For if at any time they have so
failed that they are not even able to feign anything, as their practice
is in other cases, then in truth they are reminded of their ignorance;
and, as though in madness, they spring up and exclaim that they are
blind and foolish. <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p4.1"></span>Anaxagoras
pronounces that all things are overspread with darkness. <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p4.2"></span>Empedocles complains that the paths
of the senses are narrow, as though for his reflections he had need of a
chariot and four horses. <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p4.3"></span>Democritus says that the truth lies
sunk in a well so deep that it has no bottom; foolishly, indeed, as he
says other things. For the truth is not, as it were, sunk in a well to
which it was permitted him to descend, or even to fall, but, as it were,
placed on the highest top of a lofty mountain, or in heaven, which is
most true. For what reason is there why he should say that it is sunk
below rather than that it is raised aloft? unless by chance he preferred
to place the mind also in the feet, or in the bottom of the heels,
rather than in the breast or in the head.  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p5"></span>So widely removed were they from
the truth itself, that even the posture of their own body did not
admonish them, that the truth must be sought for by them in the highest
place. <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) From this despair arose
that confession of <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p6.4"></span>Socrates, in
which he said that he knew nothing but this one thing alone, that he
knew nothing. From this flowed the system of the Academy, if that is to
be called a system in which ignorance is both learnt and taught. But not
even those who claimed for themselves knowledge were able consistently
to defend that very thing which they thought that they knew. For since
they were not in agreement <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) with
one another, through their ignorance of divine things they were so
inconsistent and uncertain, and often asserting things contrary to one
another, that you are unable to determine and decide what their meaning
was. Why therefore should you fight against those men who perish by
their own sword? Why should you labour to refute those whom their own
speech refutes and presses? <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md)
<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p8.3"></span>Aristotle, says <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxviii-p8.4"></span>Cicero, accusing the ancient
philosophers, declares that they are either most foolish or most
vainglorious, since they thought that philosophy was perfected by their
talents; but that he saw, because a great addition had been made in a
few years, that philosophy would be complete in a short time. What,
then, was that time? In what manner, when, or by whom, was philosophy
completed? For that which he said, that they were most foolish in
supposing that philosophy was made perfect by their talents, is true;
but he did not even himself speak with sufficient discretion, who
thought that it had either been begun by the ancients, or increased by
those who were more recent, or that it would shortly be brought to
perfection by those of later times. For that can never be investigated
which is not sought by its own way.
