#### <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIV.—Of the Antipodes, the Heaven, and the Stars.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxiv-p1"></span>How is it with those who imagine
that there are antipodes <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md)
opposite to our footsteps? Do they say anything to the purpose? Or is
there any one so senseless as to believe that there are men whose
footsteps are higher than their heads? or that the things which with us
are in a recumbent position, with them hang in an inverted direction?
that the crops and trees grow downwards? that the rains, and snow, and
hail fall upwards to the earth? And does any one wonder that hanging
gardens <span id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) are mentioned among the
seven wonders of the world, when philosophers make hanging fields, and
seas, and cities, and mountains? The origin of this error must also be
set forth by us. For they are always deceived in the same manner. For
when they have assumed anything false in the commencement of their
investigations, led by the resemblance of the truth, they necessarily
fall into those things which are its consequences. Thus they fall into
many ridiculous things; because those things which are in agreement with
false things, must themselves be false. But since they placed confidence
in the first, they do not consider the character of those things which
follow, but defend them in every way; whereas they ought to judge from
those which follow, whether the first are true or false.  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxiv-p4"></span>What course of argument, therefore,
led them to the idea of the antipodes? They saw the courses of the stars
travelling towards the west; they saw that the sun and the moon always
set towards the same quarter, and rise from the same. But since they did
not perceive what contrivance regulated their courses, nor how they
returned from the west to the east, but supposed that the heaven itself
sloped downwards in every direction, which appearance it must present on
account of its immense breadth, they thought that the world is round
like a ball, and they fancied that the heaven revolves in accordance
with the motion of the heavenly bodies; and thus that the stars and sun,
when they have set, by the very rapidity of the motion of the
world <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) are borne back to the
east. Therefore they both constructed brazen orbs, as though after the
figure of the world, and engraved upon them certain monstrous images,
which they said were constellations. It followed, therefore, from this
rotundity of the heaven, that the earth was enclosed in the midst of its
curved surface. But if this were so, the earth also itself must be like
a globe; for that could not possibly be anything but round, which was
held enclosed by that which was round. But if the earth also were round,
it must necessarily happen that it should present the same appearance to
all parts of the heaven; that is, that it should raise aloft mountains,
extend plains, and have level seas. And if this were so, that last
consequence also followed, that there would be no part of the earth
uninhabited by men and the other animals. Thus the rotundity of the
earth leads, in addition, to the invention of those suspended antipodes.
<span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxiv-p6"></span>But if you inquire from those who
defend these marvellous fictions, why all things do not fall into that
lower part of the heaven, they reply that such is the nature of things,
that heavy bodies are borne to the middle, and that they are all joined
together towards the middle, as we see spokes in a wheel; but that the
bodies which are light, as mist, smoke, and fire, are borne away from
the middle, so as to seek the heaven. I am at a loss what to say
respecting those who, when they have once erred, consistently persevere
in their folly, and defend one vain thing by another; but that I
sometimes imagine that they either discuss philosophy for the sake of a
jest, or purposely and knowingly undertake to defend falsehoods, as if
to exercise or display their talents on false subjects. But I should be
able to prove by many arguments that it is impossible for the heaven to
be lower than the earth, were is not that this book must now be
concluded, and that some things still remain, which are more necessary
for the present work. And since it is not the work of a single book to
run over the errors of each individually, let it be sufficient to have
enumerated a few, from which the nature of the others may be understood.
