#### <span id="iii.v.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIV.

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p1"></span>But <span
id="iii.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Galerius, not satisfied with the tenor of the
edict, sought in another way to gain on the emperor. That he might urge
him to excess of cruelty in persecution, he employed private emissaries
to set the palace on fire; and some part of it having been burnt, the
blame was laid on the Christians as public enemies; and the very
appellation of <span id="iii.v.xiv-p1.2"></span>Christian grew
odious <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) on account of that
fire. It was said that the Christians, in concert with the eunuchs, had
plotted to destroy the princes; and that both of the princes had
well-nigh been burnt alive in their own palace. <span
id="iii.v.xiv-p2.2"></span>Diocletian, shrewd and intelligent as he
always chose to appear, suspected nothing of the contrivance, but,
inflamed with anger, immediately commanded that all his own domestics
should be tortured to force a confession of the plot. He sat on his
tribunal, and saw innocent men tormented by fire to make discovery. All
magistrates, and all who had superintendency in the imperial palace,
obtained special commissions to administer the torture; and they strove
with each other <span id="iii.v.xiv-p2.3"></span>who should be first in
bringing to light the conspiracy. No circumstances, however, of the fact
were detected anywhere; for no one applied the torture to any domestics
of <span id="iii.v.xiv-p2.4"></span>Galerius. He himself was ever with
<span id="iii.v.xiv-p2.5"></span>Diocletian, constantly urging him, and
never allowing the passions of the inconsiderate old man to cool. Then,
after an interval of fifteen days, he attempted a second fire; but that
was perceived quickly, and extinguished. Still, however, its author
remained unknown. On that very day, <span
id="iii.v.xiv-p2.6"></span>Galerius, who in the middle of winter had
prepared for his departure, suddenly hurried out of the city, protesting
that he fled to escape being burnt alive.
