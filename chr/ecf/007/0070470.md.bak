#### <span id="ix.ix.v-p0.1"></span>Sec. V.—All the Apostles Urge the Observance of the Order of the Church.

##### <span id="ix.ix.v-p0.2"></span>That Every One Ought to Remain in that Rank Wherein He is Placed, But Not Snatch Such Offices to Himself Which are Not Entrusted to Him.

<span id="ix.ix.v-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.v-p1.1"></span>XLVI</span>. Now this we all in common do
charge you, that every one remain in that rank which is appointed him,
and do not transgress his proper bounds; for they are not ours, but
God’s. For says the Lord: “He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that
heareth me, heareth Him that sent me.” And, “He that despiseth you,
despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth Him that sent
me.” <span id="fr_3752"></span>[3753](#fn_3752.md) For if those things that
are without life do observe good order, as the night, the day, the sun,
the moon, the stars, the elements, the seasons, the months, the weeks,
the days, and the hours, and are subservient to the uses appointed them,
according to that which is said, “Thou hast set them a bound which they
shall not pass;” <span id="fr_3753"></span>[3754](#fn_3753.md) and again,
concerning the sea, “I have set bounds thereto, and have encompassed it
with bars and gates; and I said to it, Hitherto shalt thou come, and
thou shalt go no farther;” <span id="fr_3754"></span>[3755](#fn_3754.md)
how much more ought ye not to venture to remove those things which we,
according to God’s will, have determined for you! But because many think
this a small matter, and venture to confound the orders, and to remove
the ordination which belongs to them severally, snatching to themselves
dignities which were never given them, and allowing themselves to bestow
that authority in a tyrannical manner which they have not themselves,
and thereby provoke God to anger (as did the followers of <span
id="ix.ix.v-p4.2"></span>Corah and King <span
id="ix.ix.v-p4.3"></span>Uzziah, <span
id="fr_3755"></span>[3756](#fn_3755.md) who, having no authority, usurped
the high-priesthood without commission from God; and the former were
burnt with fire, and the latter was struck with a leprosy in his
forehead); and provoke Christ <span id="ix.ix.v-p5.3"></span>Jesus to
anger, who has made this constitution; and also grieve the Holy Spirit,
and make void His testimony: therefore, foreknowing the danger that
hangs over those who do such things, and the neglect about the
sacrifices and eucharistical offices which will arise from their being
impiously offered by those who ought not to offer them; who think the
honour of the high-priesthood, which is an imitation of the great High
Priest <span id="ix.ix.v-p5.4"></span>Jesus Christ our King, to be a
matter of sport; we have found it necessary to give you warning in this
matter also. For some are already turned aside after their own vanity.
We say that <span id="ix.ix.v-p5.5"></span>Moses the servant of God (“to
whom God spake face to face, as if a man spake to his friend;” <span
id="fr_3756"></span>[3757](#fn_3756.md) to whom He said, “I know thee above
all men;” to whom He spake directly, and not by obscure methods, or
dreams, or angels, or riddles),—this person, when he made constitutions
and divine laws, distinguished what things were to be performed by the
high priests, what by the priests, and what by the Levites; distributing
to every one his proper and suitable office in the divine service. And
those things which are allotted for the high priests to do, those might
not be meddled with by the priests; and what things were allotted to the
priests, the Levites might not meddle with; but every one observed those
ministrations which were written down and appointed for them. And if any
would meddle beyond the tradition, death was his punishment. And <span
id="ix.ix.v-p6.3"></span>Saul’s example does show this most plainly,
who, thinking he might offer sacrifice without the prophet and high
priest Samuel, <span id="fr_3757"></span>[3758](#fn_3757.md) drew upon
himself a sin and a curse without remedy. Nor did even his having
anointed him king discourage the prophet. But God showed the same by a
more visible effect in the case of <span
id="ix.ix.v-p7.2"></span>Uzziah, <span
id="fr_3758"></span>[3759](#fn_3758.md) when He without delay exacted the
punishment due to this transgression, and he that madly coveted after
the high-priesthood was rejected from his kingdom also. As to those
things that have happened amongst us, you yourselves are not ignorant of
them. For ye know undoubtedly that those that are by us named bishops,
and presbyters, and deacons, were made by prayer, and by the laying on
of hands; and that by the difference of their names is showed the
difference of their employments. For not every one that will is
ordained, as the case was in that spurious and counterfeit priesthood of
the calves under <span id="ix.ix.v-p8.2"></span>Jeroboam; <span
id="fr_3759"></span>[3760](#fn_3759.md) but he only who is called of God.
For if there were no rule or distinction of orders, it would suffice to
perform all the offices under one name. But being taught by the Lord the
series of things, we distributed the functions of the high-priesthood to
the bishops, those of the priesthood to the presbyters, and the
ministration under them both to the deacons; that the divine worship
might be performed in purity. For it is not lawful for a deacon to offer
the sacrifice, or to baptize, or to give either the greater or the
lesser blessing. Nor may a presbyter perform ordination; for it is not
agreeable to holiness to have this order perverted. For “God is not the
God of confusion,” <span id="fr_3760"></span>[3761](#fn_3760.md) that the
subordinate persons should tyrannically assume to themselves the
functions belonging to their superiors, forming a new scheme of laws to
their own mischief, not knowing that “it is hard for them to <span
id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span id="ix.ix.v-Page_500"></span>kick
against the pricks;” <span id="fr_3761"></span>[3762](#fn_3761.md) for such
as these do not fight against us, or against the bishops, but against
the universal Bishop and the High Priest of the Father, <span
id="ix.ix.v-p11.5"></span>Jesus Christ our Lord. <span
id="fr_3762"></span>[3763](#fn_3762.md) High priests, priests, and Levites
were ordained by <span id="ix.ix.v-p12.1"></span>Moses, <span
id="fr_3763"></span>[3764](#fn_3763.md) the most beloved of God. By our
Saviour <span id="fr_3764"></span>[3765](#fn_3764.md) were we apostles,
thirteen in number, ordained; and by the apostles I <span
id="ix.ix.v-p14.1"></span>James, and I <span
id="ix.ix.v-p14.2"></span>Clement, and others with us, were ordained,
that we may not make the catalogue of all those bishops over again. And
in common, presbyters, and deacons, and sub-deacons, and readers, were
ordained by all of us. The great High Priest therefore, who is so by
nature, is Christ the only begotten; not having snatched that honour to
Himself, but having been appointed such by the Father; who being made
man for our sake, and offering the spiritual sacrifice to His God and
Father, before His suffering gave it us alone in charge to do this,
although there were others with us who had believed in Him. But he that
believes is not presently appointed a priest, or obtains the dignity of
the high-priesthood. But after His ascension we offered, according to
His constitution, the pure and unbloody sacrifice; and ordained bishops,
and presbyters, and deacons, seven in number: one of which was <span
id="ix.ix.v-p14.3"></span>Stephen, <span
id="fr_3765"></span>[3766](#fn_3765.md) that blessed martyr, who was not
inferior to us as to his pious disposition of mind towards God; who
showed so great piety towards God, by his faith and love towards our
Lord <span id="ix.ix.v-p15.3"></span>Jesus Christ, as to give his life
for Him, and was stoned to death by the Jews, the murderers of the Lord.
Yet still this so great and good a man, who was fervent in spirit, who
saw Christ on the right hand of God, and the gates of heaven opened,
does nowhere appear to have exercised functions which did not appertain
to his office of a deacon, nor to have offered the sacrifices, nor to
have laid hands upon any, but kept his order of a deacon unto the end.
For so it became him, who was a martyr for Christ, to preserve good
order. But if some do blame <span id="ix.ix.v-p15.4"></span>Philip <span
id="fr_3766"></span>[3767](#fn_3766.md) our deacon, and <span
id="ix.ix.v-p16.7"></span>Ananias <span
id="fr_3767"></span>[3768](#fn_3767.md) our faithful brother, that the one
did baptize the eunuch, and the other me <span
id="ix.ix.v-p17.3"></span>Paul, these men do not understand what we say.
For we have affirmed only that no one snatches the sacerdotal dignity to
himself, but either receives it from God, as <span
id="ix.ix.v-p17.4"></span>Melchisedec and <span
id="ix.ix.v-p17.5"></span>Job, or from the high priest, as <span
id="ix.ix.v-p17.6"></span>Aaron from <span
id="ix.ix.v-p17.7"></span>Moses. Wherefore <span
id="ix.ix.v-p17.8"></span>Philip and <span
id="ix.ix.v-p17.9"></span>Ananias did not constitute themselves, but
were appointed by Christ, the High Priest of that God to whom no being
is to be compared.
