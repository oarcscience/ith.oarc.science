#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIV.—Of the Affections, and the Opinion of the Stoics Respecting Them; And of Virtue, the Vices, and Mercy.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xiv-p1"></span>If, therefore, mercy is a
distinguished and excellent gift in man, and that is judged to be very
good by the consent both of the good and the evil, it appears that
philosophers were far distant from the good of man, who neither enjoined
nor practised anything of this kind, but always esteemed as a vice that
virtue which almost holds the first place in man. It pleases me here to
bring forward one subject of philosophy, that we may more fully refute
the errors of those who call mercy, desire, and fear, diseases of the
soul. They indeed attempt to distinguish virtues from vices, which is
truly a very easy matter. For who cannot distinguish a liberal man from
one who is prodigal (as they do), or a frugal man from one who is mean,
or a calm man from one who is slothful, or a cautious man from one who
is timid? Because these things which are good have their limits, and if
they shall exceed these limits, fall into vices; so that constancy,
unless it is undertaken for the truth, becomes shamelessness. In like
manner, bravery, if it shall undergo certain danger, without the
compulsion of any necessity, or not for an honourable cause, is changed
into rashness. Freedom of speech also, if it attack others rather than
oppose those who attack it, is obstinacy. Severity also, unless it
restrain itself within the befitting punishments of the guilty, becomes
savage cruelty.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xiv-p2"></span>Therefore they say, that those who
appear evil do not sin of their own accord, or choose evils by
preference, but that, erring <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md)
through the appearance of good, they fall into evils, while they are
ignorant of the distinction between good things and evil. These things
are not indeed false, but they are all referred to the body. For to be
frugal, or constant, or cautious, or calm, or grave, or severe, are
virtues indeed, but virtues which relate to this short <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md) life. But we who despise this life
have other virtues set before us, respecting which philosophers could
not by any means even conjecture. Therefore they regarded certain
virtues as vices, and certain vices as virtues. For the Stoics take away
from man all the affections, by the impulse of which the soul is
moved—desire, joy, fear, sorrow: the two former of which arise from good
things, either future or present; the latter from evil things. In the
same manner, they call these four (as I said) diseases, not so much
inserted in us by nature as undertaken through a perverted opinion; and
therefore they think that these can be eradicated, if the false notion
of good and evil things is taken away. For if the wise man thinks
nothing good or evil, he will neither be inflamed with desire, nor be
transported with joy, nor be alarmed with fear, nor suffer his spirits
to droop <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md) through sadness. We
shall presently see whether they effect that which they wish, or what it
is which they do effect: in the meantime their purpose is arrogant and
almost mad, who think that they apply a remedy, and that they are able
to strive in opposition to the force and system of nature.
