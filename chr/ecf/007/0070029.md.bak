<span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. xxiii.—of the ages of vain superstitions, and the times at which they commenced.

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p1"></span>Now, since we have ascertained the
origin of vain superstitions, it remains that we should also collect the
times during which they whose memory is honoured lived. <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Theophilus, <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) in his book written to <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p2.4"></span>Autolycus respecting the times, <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) says that <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p3.5"></span>Thallus relates in his history, that
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p3.6"></span>Belus, who is worshipped by the
Babylonians and Assyrians, is found to have lived 322 years before the
Trojan war; that <span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p3.7"></span>Belus, moreover,
was contemporary with <span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p3.8"></span>Saturnus, and
that they both grew up at one time;—which is so true, that it may be
inferred by reason itself. For <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p3.9"></span>Agamemnon, who carried on the Trojan war,
was the fourth <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) in descent from
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p4.1"></span>Jupiter; and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p4.2"></span>Achilles and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p4.3"></span>Ajax were of the third <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) descent from him; and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.1"></span>Ulysses was related in the same degree.
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.2"></span>Priam, indeed, was distant by a
long series of descents. But according to some authorities, <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.3"></span>Dardanus and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.4"></span>Iasius were sons of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.5"></span>Coritus, not of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.6"></span>Jupiter. For if it had been so, <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.7"></span>Jupiter could not have formed that
unchaste connection with <span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.8"></span>Ganymede,
his own descendant. Therefore, if you divide the years which are in
agreement, the number will be found in harmony with the parents of those
whom I have named above. Now, from the destruction of the Trojan city
fourteen hundred and seventy years are made up. From this calculation of
times, it is manifest that <span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p5.9"></span>Saturnus
has not been born more than eighteen hundred years, and he also was the
father of all the gods. Let them not glory, then, in the antiquity of
their sacred rites, since both their origin and system and times have
been ascertained. There still remain some things which may be of great
weight for the disproving of false religions; but I have determined now
to bring this book to an end, that it may not exceed moderate limits.
For those things must be followed up more fully, that, having refuted
all things which seem to oppose the truth, we may be able to instruct in
true religion men who, through ignorance of good things, wander in
uncertainty. But the first step towards wisdom is to understand what is
false; the second, to ascertain what is true. Therefore he who shall
have profited by this first discussion of mine, in which we have exposed
false things, will be excited to the knowledge of the truth, than which
no pleasure is more gratifying to man; and he will now be worthy of the
wisdom of heavenly training, who shall approach with willingness and
preparation to the knowledge of the other subjects.

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p2"></span> <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Theophilus was bishop of Antioch in the
latter part of the second century. He was originally a heathen, and was
converted to Christianity, as he tells us, by the reading of the
Scriptures. \[See vol. ii. pp. 87 and 120, this series.\]

this title, but his work to <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxiv-p3.3"></span>Autolycus contains an apology for
Christianity in three books. It is to this that <span
