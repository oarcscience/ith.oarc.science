#### <span id="iii.ii.v.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXI.—Of the Worship of Other Gods and the True God, and of the Animals Which the Egyptians Worshipped.

<span id="iii.ii.v.xxi-p1"></span>But they, because they know not the
object or the mode of worship, blindly and unconsciously fall into the
contrary practice. Thus they adore their enemies, they appease with
victims their robbers and murderers, and they place their own souls to
be burned with the very incense on detestable altars. The wretched men
are also angry, because others do not perish in like manner, with
incredible blindness of minds. For what can they see who do not see the
sun? As though, if they were gods, they would need the assistance of men
against their despisers. Why, therefore, are they angry with us, if they
have no power to effect anything? Unless it be that they destroy their
gods, whose power they distrust, they are more irreligious than those
who do not worship them at all. <span
id="iii.ii.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Cicero, in his Laws, <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) enjoining men to approach with
holiness to the sacrifices, says, “Let them put on piety, let them lay
aside riches; if any one shall act otherwise, God Himself will be the
avenger.” This is well spoken; for it is not right to despair about God,
whom you worship on this account, because you think Him powerful. For
how can He avenge the wrongs of His worshippers, if He is unable to
avenge His own? I wish therefore to ask them to whom especially they
think that they are doing a service in compelling them to sacrifice
against their will, Is it to those whom they compel? But that is not a
kindness which is done to one who refuses it. But we must consult their
interests, even against their will, since they know not what is good.
Why, then, do they so cruelly harass, torture, and weaken them, if they
wish for their safety? or whence is piety so impious, that they either
destroy in this wretched manner, or render useless, those whose welfare
they wish to promote? Or do they do service to the gods? But that is not
a sacrifice which is extorted from a person against his will. For unless
it is offered spontaneously, and from the soul, it is a curse; when men
sacrifice, compelled by proscription, by injuries, by prison, by
tortures. If they are gods who are worshipped in this manner, if for
this reason only, they ought not to be worshipped, because they wish to
be worshipped in this manner: they are doubtless worthy of the
detestation of men, since libations are made to them with tears, with
groaning, and with blood flowing from all the limbs.  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xxi-p3"></span>But we, on the contrary, do not
require that any one should be compelled, whether he is willing or
unwilling, to worship our God, who is the God of all men; nor are we
angry if any one does not worship Him. For we trust in the majesty of
Him who has power to avenge contempt shown towards Himself, as also He
has power to avenge the calamities and injuries inflicted on His
servants. And therefore, when we suffer such impious things, we do not
resist even in word; but we remit vengeance to God, not as they act who
would have it appear that they are defenders of their gods, and rage
without restraint against those who do not worship them. From which it
may be understood how it is not good to worship their gods, since men
ought to have been led to that which is good by good, and not by evil;
but because this is evil, even its office is destitute of good. But they
who destroy religious systems must be punished. Have we destroyed them
in a worse manner than the nation of the Egyptians, who worship the most
disgraceful figures of beasts and cattle, and adore as gods some things
which it is even shameful to speak of? Have we done worse than those
same who, when they say that they worship the gods, yet publicly and
shamefully deride them?—for they even allow pantomimic <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) representations of them to be acted
with laughter and pleasure. What kind of a religion is this, or how
great must that majesty be considered, which is adored in temples and
mocked in theatres? And they who have done these things do not suffer
the vengeance of the injured deity, but even go away honoured and
praised. Do we destroy them in a worse manner than certain philosophers,
who say that there are no gods at all, but that all things are
spontaneously produced, and that all things which are done happen by
chance? Do we destroy them in a worse manner than the Epicureans, who
admit the existence of gods, but deny that they regard anything, and say
that they are neither angry nor are influenced by favour? By which words
they plainly persuade men that they are not to be worshipped at all,
inasmuch as they neither regard their worshippers, nor are angry with
those who do not worship them. Moreover, when they argue against fears,
they endeavour to effect nothing else than that no one should fear the
gods. And yet these things are willingly heard by men, and discussed
with impunity.
