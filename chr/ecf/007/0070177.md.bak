#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIII.—Of the Soul, and the Testimonies Concerning Its Eternity.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1"></span>I have made it evident, as I think,
that the soul is not subject to dissolution. It remains that I bring
forward witnesses by whose authority my arguments may be confirmed. And
I will not now allege the testimony of the prophets, whose system and
divination consist in this alone, the teaching that man was created for
the worship of God, and for receiving immortality from Him; but I will
rather bring forward those whom they who reject the truth cannot but
believe. <span id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Hermes, describing the
nature of man, that he might show how he was made by God, introduced
this statement: “And the same out of two natures—the immortal and the
mortal—made one nature, that of man, making the same partly immortal,
and partly mortal; and bringing this, he placed it in the midst, between
that nature which was divine and immortal, and that which was mortal and
changeable, that seeing all things, he may admire all things.” But some
one may perhaps reckon him in the number of the philosophers, although
he has been placed among the gods, and honoured by the Egyptians under
the name of <span id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.2"></span>Mercury, and may give
no more authority to him than to <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.3"></span>Plato or <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.4"></span>Pythagoras. Let us therefore seek for
greater testimony. A certain <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.5"></span>Polites asked <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.6"></span>Apollo of Miletus whether the soul
remains after death or goes to dissolution; and he replied in these
verses:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p1.7"></span> “As long as the soul is bound
> by fetters to the body, perceiving corruptible sufferings, it yields
> to mortal pains; but when, after the wasting of the body, it has found
> a very swift dissolution of mortality, it is altogether borne into the
> air, never growing old, and it remains always uninjured; for the
> first-born providence of God made this disposition.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p2"></span>What do the Sibylline poems say? Do
they not declare that this is so, when they say that the time will come
when God will judge the living and the dead?—whose authority we will
hereafter bring forward. <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md)
Therefore the opinion entertained by <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p6.4"></span>Democritus, and <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p6.5"></span>Epicurus, and <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p6.6"></span>Dicæarchus concerning the dissolution
of the soul is false; and they would not venture to speak concerning the
destruction of souls, in the presence of any magician, who knew that
souls are called forth from the lower regions by certain incantations,
and that they are at hand, and afford themselves to be seen by human
eyes, and speak, and foretell future events; and if they should thus
venture, they would be overpowered by the fact itself, and by proofs
presented to them. But because they did not comprehend the nature of the
soul, which is so subtle that it escapes the eyes of the human mind,
they said that it perishes. What of <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-p6.7"></span>Aristoxenus, who denied that there is
any soul at all, even while it lives in the body? But as on the lyre
harmonious sound, and the strain which musicians call harmony, is
produced by the tightening of the strings, so he thought that the power
of perception existed in bodies from the joining together of the vitals,
and from the vigour of the limbs; than which nothing can be said more
senseless. Truly he had his eyes uninjured, but his heart was blind,
with which he did not see that he lived, and had the mind by which he
had conceived that very thought. But this has happened to many
philosophers, <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xiii-Page_211"></span>that they did not believe in the
existence of any object which is not apparent to the eyes; whereas the
sight of the mind ought to be much clearer than that of the body, for
perceiving those things the force and nature of which are rather felt
than seen.
