<span id="iii.iii.xxii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.iii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXII.—Of Sins, and the Verses of the Sibyls Respecting Them Recited.

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p1"></span>This is what I had to say, most
beloved <span id="iii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Donatus, respecting the
anger of God, that you might know how to refute those who represent God
as being without emotions. <span id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) It
only remains that, after the practice of <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p2.2"></span>Cicero, I should use an <span
id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-Page_278"></span>epilogue by way of peroration. As he
did in the <span id="iii.iii.xxii-p2.3"></span>Tusculan
Disputations, <span id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md) when
discoursing on the subject of death, so we in this work ought to bring
forward divine testimonies, which may be believed, to refute the
persuasion of those who, believing that God is without anger, destroy
all religion, without which, as we have shown, we are either equal to
the brutes in savageness, or to the cattle in foolishness; for it is in
religion only—that is, in the knowledge of the Supreme God—that wisdom
consists. All the prophets, being filled with the Divine Spirit, speak
nothing else than of the favour of God towards the righteous, and His
anger against the ungodly. And their testimony is indeed sufficient for
us; but because it is not believed by those who make a display of wisdom
by their hair and dress, <span id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) it
was necessary to refute them by reason and arguments. For they act so
preposterously, <span id="fr_1785"></span>[1786](#fn_1785.md) that human
things give authority to divine things, whereas divine things ought
rather to give authority to human. But let us now leave these things,
lest we should produce no effect upon them, and the subject should be
indefinitely drawn out. Let us therefore seek those testimonies which
they can either believe, or at any rate not oppose.  

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p6"></span>Authors of great number and weight
have made mention of the Sibyls; of the Greeks, <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.1"></span>Aristo the Chian, and <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.2"></span>Apollodorus the Erythræan; of our writers,
<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.3"></span>Varro and <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.4"></span>Fenestella. All these relate that the
<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.5"></span>Erythræan Sibyl was distinguished
and noble beyond the rest. <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.6"></span>Apollodorus, indeed, boasts of her as his
own citizen and countrywoman. But <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.7"></span>Fenestella also relates that ambassadors
were sent by the senate to Erythræ, that the verses of this <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.8"></span>Sibyl might be conveyed to Rome, and that
the consuls <span id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.9"></span>Curio and <span
id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.10"></span>Octavius might take care that they should
be placed in the Capitol, which had then been restored under the care of
<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.11"></span>Quintus Catulus. In her writings,
verses of this kind are found respecting the Supreme God and Maker of
the world:—  

> <span id="iii.iii.xxii-p6.12"></span> “The incorruptible and eternal
> Maker who dwells in the heaven, holding forth good to the good, a much
> greater reward, but stirring up anger and rage against the evil and
> unjust.”  

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p7"></span>Again, in another place, enumerating
the deeds by which God is especially moved to anger, she introduced
these things:—  

> <span id="iii.iii.xxii-p7.1"></span> “Avoid unlawful services, and
> serve the living God. Abstain from adultery and impurity; bring up a
> pure generation of children; do not kill: for the Immortal will be
> angry with every one who may sin.”  

<span id="iii.iii.xxii-p8"></span>Therefore He is angry with sinners.
