#### <span id="iii.v.xii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XII.

<span id="iii.v.xii-p1"></span>A fit and auspicious day was sought out
for the accomplishment of this undertaking; and the festival of the god
<span id="iii.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Terminus, celebrated on the sevens of
the kalends of March, <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) was
chosen, in preference to all others, to terminate, as it were, the
Christian religion.  

> <span id="iii.v.xii-p2.1"></span> “That day, the harbinger of death,
> arose,  
> First cause of ill, and long enduring woes;”  

<span id="iii.v.xii-p3"></span>of woes which befell not only the
Christians, but the whole earth. When that day dawned, in the eighth
consulship of <span id="iii.v.xii-p3.1"></span>Diocletian and seventh of
<span id="iii.v.xii-p3.2"></span>Maximian, suddenly, while it was yet
hardly light, the prefect, together with chief commanders, tribunes, and
officers of the treasury, came to the church in Nicomedia, and the gates
having been forced open, they searched everywhere for an image of the
Divinity. The books of the Holy Scriptures were found, and they were
committed to the flames; the utensils and furniture of the church were
abandoned to pillage: all was rapine, confusion, tumult. That church,
situated on rising ground, was within view of the palace; and <span
id="iii.v.xii-p3.3"></span>Diocletian and <span
id="iii.v.xii-p3.4"></span>Galerius stood, as if on a watch-tower,
disputing long whether it ought to be set on fire. The sentiment of
<span id="iii.v.xii-p3.5"></span>Diocletian prevailed, who dreaded lest,
so great a fire being once kindled, some part of the city might he
burnt; for there were many and large buildings that surrounded the
church. Then the Pretorian Guards came in battle array, with axes and
other iron instruments, and having been let loose everywhere, they in a
few hours levelled that very lofty edifice with the ground. <span
