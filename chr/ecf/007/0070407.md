#### <span id="viii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>section 5.—time and place of composition.

<span id="viii.ii.v-p1"></span>Granting the general authenticity of the
Greek work, the time of composition must be at least as early as the
first half of the second century. If the <span
id="viii.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Teaching is older than <span
id="viii.ii.v-p1.2"></span>Barnabas, then it cannot be later than <span
class="sc"><span id="viii.ii.v-p1.3"></span>a.d.</span> 120. If both are
from a common source, the interval of time was probably not very
great. <span id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) The document itself
bears many marks of an early date:—  

<span id="viii.ii.v-p3"></span>(1) Its simplicity, almost amounting to
childishness, not only discountenances all idea of <span
id="page_375">p. 375</span> <span
id="viii.ii.v-Page_375"></span>forgery, but points to the sub-apostolic
age, during which Christianity manifested this characteristic. The fact
is an important one in the discussion of the canon of the New Testament.
 

<span id="viii.ii.v-p4"></span>(2) The undeveloped Christian thought, as
well as the indications of undeveloped heresy, <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) confirms this position.
Christianity was at first a life, for which the Apostles furnished a
basis of revealed thought. But the Christians of the sub-apostolic age
had not consciously assimilated the thought to any large extent, while
their ethical striving was stimulated by the gross sins surrounding
them. <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md)  

<span id="viii.ii.v-p7"></span>(3) The Church polity indicated in the
<span id="viii.ii.v-p7.1"></span>Teaching is less developed than that of
the genuine Ignatian Epistles, and shows the existence of extraordinary
travelling teachers (“Apostles” and “Prophets,” chap. xi.). This points
to a date not later than the first half of the second century, probably
as early as the first quarter. <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md)  

<span id="viii.ii.v-p9"></span>Most of these phenomena would, however,
consist with a date as late as that of the Ignatian Epistles on the
theory that the <span id="viii.ii.v-p9.1"></span>Teaching was written
for a community of Christians in some obscure locality. But this theory
must admit that there existed for a long time great variety of Church
polity and worship. <span id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) Of this
there is, indeed, considerable evidence. The undeveloped form of the
doctrinal elements of the work constitutes the most serious objection to
the theory of a late origin. On the other hand, it seems on many
accounts improbable that the work, in its present form, was written
earlier than the beginning of the second century: (1) Such a document
would not be penned during the lifetime of any of the Apostles. (2)
There is no allusion in chap. xvi. to the destruction of Jerusalem. If
the author was a Jewish Christian, as seems most probable, such silence
implies an interval of at least one generation. (3) The position of the
document in the Codex is <span id="viii.ii.v-p10.3"></span>after the
Clementine Epistles, and <span id="viii.ii.v-p10.4"></span>before the
Ignatian. This probably marks the chronological position. (4) The
extreme simplicity scarcely consists with the view that the author was
nearly contemporary with the Apostles.  

<span id="viii.ii.v-p11"></span><span
id="viii.ii.v-p11.1"></span>Bryennios and <span
id="viii.ii.v-p11.2"></span>Harnack assign, as the date, between 120 and
160; <span id="viii.ii.v-p11.3"></span>Hilgenfeld, 160 and 190; English
and American scholars vary between <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.ii.v-p11.4"></span>a.d.</span> 80 and 120. Until the priority
to <span id="viii.ii.v-p11.5"></span>Barnabas is more positively
established, the two may be regarded as of the same age, about 120,
although a date slightly later is not impossible. All attempts to
discover the author are, with our present lack of data, necessarily
futile. Even the region in and for which it was composed cannot be
determined. Jewish-Christian tendencies are not sufficiently indicated
to warrant the assumption of a polemical aim. <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) The document has been assigned to
Alexandria, to Antioch, to Jerusalem; indeed, many other places have
been named. In favour of the Syrian origin is the literary connection
with the <span id="viii.ii.v-p12.6"></span>Apostolic Constitutions,
while the correspondences with the Epistle to <span
id="viii.ii.v-p12.7"></span>Barnabas suggest Egypt as the locality. If
the <span id="viii.ii.v-p12.8"></span>Teaching and <span
id="viii.ii.v-p12.9"></span>Barnabas have a common basis, e.g., the
<span id="viii.ii.v-p12.10"></span>Duæ Viæ, the last may be assigned to
Egypt, and the <span id="viii.ii.v-p12.11"></span>Teaching, in its
present form, to Syria. The Palestinian origin is urged by those who lay
stress upon the absence of Pauline doctrine in the <span
id="viii.ii.v-p12.12"></span>Teaching \[If meant for catechumens only,
this fact is sufficiently accounted for.\]  

<span id="viii.ii.v-p13"></span>The question is still an open one.  

<span id="viii.ii.v-p14"></span>As regards the doctrine, polity, usages,
and ethics expressed and implied in the <span
id="viii.ii.v-p14.1"></span>Teaching, the reader can judge for himself.
The writer is of the opinion that the work represents, on many of these
points, only a very small fraction of the Christians during the second
century, and that, while it casts some light upon usages of that period,
it cannot be regarded as an authoritative witness concerning the
universal faith and practice of believers at the date usually assigned
to it. The few notices of it, and its early disappearance, confirm this
position. The theory of a composite origin also accords with this
estimate of the document as a whole. <span id="page_376">p. 376</span>
<span id="viii.ii.v-Page_376"></span>  

<span id="viii.ii.v-p15"></span>The version of the <span
id="viii.ii.v-p15.1"></span>Teaching here given is that of Professor
<span id="viii.ii.v-p15.2"></span>Isaac H. Hall and Mr. <span
id="viii.ii.v-p15.3"></span>John T. Napier, which first appeared in the
<span id="viii.ii.v-p15.4"></span>Sunday-School Times (Philadelphia),
April 12, 1884. It is now republished by permission of the editor of
that periodical and of the joint authors. A few slight changes have been
made, some of them in accordance with suggestions from Professor <span
id="viii.ii.v-p15.5"></span>Hall, others to indicate correspondences
with book vii. of <span id="viii.ii.v-p15.6"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions.  

<span id="viii.ii.v-p16"></span>The division of verses agrees with that
of <span id="viii.ii.v-p16.1"></span>Harnack as given by <span
id="viii.ii.v-p16.2"></span>Schaff. The headings to the chapters have
been inserted by the editor. The Scripture references have been selected
and verified. The notes have been kept within narrow limits. They serve
to indicate the relation of the matter to that in other early writings,
mainly the <span id="viii.ii.v-p16.3"></span>Apostolic Constitutions,
and to give various readings and renderings. Occasionally explanations
and comments have been inserted. In dealing with this, as with most
other books, the best method of study is historico-exegetical. To read
the book intelligently is better than to read about it. The editor has
sought to furnish some help in this method.
