#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chap. II.—That There is But One God, and that There Cannot Be More.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p1"></span>Another question follows: Whether
there be one God or more? And this indeed contains much ambiguity. For
not only do individuals differ among themselves, but also peoples and
nations. But he who shall follow the guidance of reason will understand
that there cannot be a Lord except one, nor a Father except one. For if
God, who made all things, is also Lord and Father, He must be one only,
so that the same may be the head and source of all things. Nor is it
possible for the world <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) to
exist unless all things be referred to one person, unless one hold the
rudder, unless one guide the reins, and, as it were, one mind direct all
the members of the body. If there are many kings in a swarm of bees,
they will perish or be scattered abroad, while  

> <span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p2.2"></span> “Discord attacks the kings
> with great commotion.” <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p4"></span>If there are several leaders in a
herd, they will contend until one gains the mastery. <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) If there <span id="page_225">p.
225</span> <span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-Page_225"></span>are many
commanders in an army, the soldiers cannot obey, since different
commands are given; nor can unity be maintained by themselves, since
each consults his own interests according to his humours. <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) Thus, in this commonwealth of the
world, unless there were one ruler, who was also its founder, either
this mass would be dissolved, or it could not have been put together at
all.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7"></span>Moreover, the whole <span
id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.1"></span>authority could not exist in many <span
id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.2"></span>deities, since they separately maintain
their own duties and their own prerogatives. No one, therefore, of them
can be called omnipotent, which is the true title of God, since he will
be able to accomplish that only which depends upon himself, and will not
venture to attempt that which depends upon others. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.3"></span>Vulcan will not claim for himself
water, nor <span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.4"></span>Neptune fire; nor will
<span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.5"></span>Ceres claim acquaintance with the
arts, nor <span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.6"></span>Minerva with fruits;
nor will <span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.7"></span>Mercury lay claim to
arms, nor <span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.8"></span>Mars to the lyre; <span
id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.9"></span>Jupiter will not claim medicine, nor
<span id="iii.ii.viii.iii-p7.10"></span>Æsculapius the thunderbolt: he
will more easily endure it when thrown by another, than he will brandish
it himself. If, therefore, individuals cannot do all things, they have
less strength and less power; but he is to be regarded as God who can
accomplish the whole, and not he who can only accomplish the smallest
part of the whole.
