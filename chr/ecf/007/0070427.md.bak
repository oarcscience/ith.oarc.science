<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.i-p3.1"></span>Having</span> learned from the erudite <span
id="ix.i-p3.2"></span>Beveridge what I long supposed to be a just view
of the <span id="ix.i-p3.3"></span>Constitutions, I have found in the
recent literature of the subject not a little to increase my confidence
in the general conclusions to which he was led by all that could be
known in his times. The treatise of <span id="ix.i-p3.4"></span>Krabbe
guided me to some results of more modern investigations; and Dr. <span
id="ix.i-p3.5"></span>Bunsen, though not apart from his critics, has
enabled me still further to correct some of my impressions. But, in
connection with the late discovery of <span
id="ix.i-p3.6"></span>Bryennios, the field of discussion and inquiry has
been so much enlarged, that I have felt it due to the readers and
students of this republication to invoke the aid of Professor <span
id="ix.i-p3.7"></span>Riddle, who is able to enrich the work with the
results of genuine learning and much patient research. Whatever may be
my own convictions on some subordinate points, I have been glad to
secure the judgment of a critical scholar who, I am persuaded, aims to
shed upon the subject the colourless light of scientific investigation.
This is all I can desire, anxious only to see facts clearly established
and historic truth illustrated, no matter to what results they may seem
to point. Where the professor’s decisions coincide with my own
impressions, I am naturally gratified by his valued and independent
corroboration: where the case is otherwise, I am hardly less gratified
to present my indulgent readers with opinions deserving of their highest
respect, and by which they will be stimulated, as well as influenced, in
forming convictions for themselves.  

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span>The <span id="ix.i-p4.1"></span>Constitutions
are so full of material on which it is well for one in my position not
to speak very freely in such a work as this, that I rejoice all the more
to confide the task of annotation almost exclusively to another and to
one from whom American Christians must ever be glad to hear on subjects
requiring in an almost equal degree the skill of an expert critic and
the candour of a conscientious Christian.  

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>I prefix Professor <span
id="ix.i-p5.1"></span>Riddle’s <span class="sc"><span
id="ix.i-p5.2"></span>Preface</span> to the Introductory Notice of the
Edinburgh editor, as follows:—  

<span id="ix.i-p6"></span>  

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.i-p7.1"></span>New</span> interest has been awakened in the <span
id="ix.i-p7.2"></span>Apostolic Constitutions by the discovery of an
ancient manuscript in Constantinople. <span
id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523.md) While it does not contain the <span
id="ix.i-p8.4"></span>Constitutions, it affords much material for
discussion respecting the sources and authorship of this compilation.
The so-called <span id="ix.i-p8.5"></span>Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles, found in the Codex at Constantinople, and published by <span
id="ix.i-p8.6"></span>Bryennios in 1883, is recognised as the basis of
the seventh book of the <span id="ix.i-p8.7"></span>Constitutions. The
verbal coincidences, the order of topics, and other obvious phenomena,
leave little room for reasonable doubt on this point. That the reader
may be in possession of the main facts, the corresponding portions have
been indicated both in book vii. of the <span
id="ix.i-p8.8"></span>Constitutions and in the version of the <span
id="ix.i-p8.9"></span>Teaching inserted in this volume. This literary
connection has some bearing on <span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="ix.i-Page_388"></span>the discussion as to the age of the <span
id="ix.i-p8.10"></span>Constitutions. If the <span
id="ix.i-p8.11"></span>Teaching is substantially the early work bearing
that name, then some of the references by early writers which have been
applied to the larger work must now be regarded as pointing to the <span
id="ix.i-p8.12"></span>Teaching; still, this only bears against the
theory of a date as early as the third century. The new critical
material furnished by the <span id="ix.i-p8.13"></span>Bryennios
manuscript for the Ignatian controversy has a bearing on the question
respecting the work before us. The opinion has been strengthened (see
below), that the same hand enlarged the Ignatian Epistles and adapted
earlier matter (such as the <span id="ix.i-p8.14"></span>Teaching) for
the <span id="ix.i-p8.15"></span>Apostolic Constitutions.  

<span id="ix.i-p9"></span>We may accept as established the following
positions:—  

<span id="ix.i-p10"></span>1. The <span id="ix.i-p10.1"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions are a compilation, the material being derived from sources
differing in age.  

<span id="ix.i-p11"></span>2. The first six books are the oldest; the
seventh, in its present form, somewhat later, but, from its connection
with the <span id="ix.i-p11.1"></span>Teaching, proven to contain matter
of a very ancient date. The eighth book is of latest date.  

<span id="ix.i-p12"></span>3. It now seems to be generally admitted that
the entire work is not later than the fourth century, although the usual
allowance must be made for later textual changes, whether by accident or
design.  

<span id="ix.i-p13"></span>Dr. <span id="ix.i-p13.1"></span>Von
Drey <span id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524.md) regards the first six
books as of Eastern origin (mainly Syrian), and to be assigned to the
second half of the third century. The seventh and eighth were more
recent, he thinks, but united with the others before <span
id="ix.i-p14.4"></span>a.d. 325. With this, <span
id="ix.i-p14.5"></span>Schaff (in his <span
id="ix.i-p14.6"></span>Church History, vol. ii, rev. ed., p. 185)
substantially agreed; but, in his later work on the <span
id="ix.i-p14.8"></span>Teaching, seems to assign the completion of the
compilation to a date somewhat later. This is the view of <span
id="ix.i-p14.9"></span>Harnack, who, “by a critical analysis and
comparison, comes to the conclusion <span
id="fr_2525"></span>[2526](#fn_2525.md) that pseudo-Clement, <span
id="ix.i-p15.1"></span>alias pseudo-Ignatius, was a Eusebian, a
semi-Arian, and rather worldly-minded anti-ascetic Bishop of Syria, a
friend of the Emperor <span id="ix.i-p15.2"></span>Constantius between
340 and 360; that he enlarged and adapted the <span
id="ix.i-p15.3"></span>Didascalia of the third and the <span
id="ix.i-p15.4"></span>Didache of the second century, as well as the
Ignatian Epistles, to his own view of morals, worship, and discipline,
and clothed them with Apostolic authority.” <span
id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526.md)  

<span id="ix.i-p17"></span>This is, at all events, a more reasonable
view than that of <span id="ix.i-p17.1"></span>Krabbe, who assigns the
first six books to the end of the third century, and the eighth to the
beginning of the fifth. The latter, it is true, he regards a compilation
from older sources. The purpose of the whole, in his view, was to
confirm the episcopal hierarchy, and to establish the unity of the
Catholic Church on the basis of the unity of the priesthood, etc. But it
is now generally held that the purpose of the compilation was merely to
present a manual of instruction, worship, polity, and usage for both
clergy and laity. Had it been designed to further some ecclesiastical
tendency, it would be far less valuable, since it would less fairly
reproduce the ecclesiastical life of the age or ages in which it
originated. Bishop <span id="ix.i-p17.2"></span>Beveridge at first
attributed the <span id="ix.i-p17.3"></span>Constitutions to <span
id="ix.i-p17.4"></span>Clemens Alexandrinus (end of second century), but
afterwards accepted the third century as the more probable date. The
views now prevalent do full justice to his opinions, but seem to be
better sustained in detail.  

<span id="ix.i-p18"></span>The collection of <span
id="ix.i-p18.1"></span>Canons at the close of the <span
id="ix.i-p18.2"></span>Constitutions is undoubtedly a compilation. Some
are evidently much more ancient than others, and there is every evidence
that various collections or recensions existed. That of <span
id="ix.i-p18.3"></span>Dionysius (about <span
id="ix.i-p18.4"></span>a.d. 500), in Latin, contained fifty canons; that
of <span id="ix.i-p18.5"></span>John (Scholasticus) of Antioch (about
<span id="ix.i-p18.6"></span>a.d. 565) contained eighty-five canons: and
“it is undeniable that the Greek copy which <span
id="ix.i-p18.7"></span>Dionysius had before him belonged to a different
<span id="page_389">p. 389</span> <span id="ix.i-Page_389"></span>family
of collections from that used by <span id="ix.i-p18.8"></span>John
Scholasticus, for they differ frequently, if not essentially, both in
text and in the way of numbering the canons.” <span
id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527.md)  

<span id="ix.i-p20"></span>Bishop <span id="ix.i-p20.1"></span>Beveridge
sought to trace these to the synods of the first two centuries, while
Daillé held that the collection was made as late as the fifth century.
The latter view is not generally accepted, though the existence of a
variety of collections tells against some of the views of Bishop <span
id="ix.i-p20.2"></span>Beveridge. <span
id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528.md) It is impossible to enter into a
full discussion here. It seemed better to annotate the <span
id="ix.i-p21.11"></span>Canons from the results of <span
id="ix.i-p21.12"></span>Drey and <span id="ix.i-p21.13"></span>Hefele,
two most candid and scholarly Roman-Catholic investigators. <span
id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529.md) The brief notes indicate the
sources according to these authors. The reader will at once perceive
from the views thus suggested, as well as from the contents of the <span
id="ix.i-p22.2"></span>Canons, that, while some canons are presumably
quite ancient, a number belong to the fourth century, and that, as a
complete collection, they cannot antedate the compilation of the <span
id="ix.i-p22.3"></span>Apostolic Constitutions. Indeed, <span
id="ix.i-p22.4"></span>Drey, who accepts the latter as Ante-Nicene (see
above), thinks five of the canons (30, 67, 74, 81, 83) were derived from
the canons of the Fourth Œcumenical Council at Chalcedon, <span
id="ix.i-p22.5"></span>a.d. 451, and quite a number of others he traces
to synods and councils of the fourth century. <span
id="ix.i-p22.6"></span>Hefele doubts the positions taken by <span
id="ix.i-p22.7"></span>Drey in regard to most of these. He does not,
however, insist that the collection is Ante-Nicene, while he traces the
origin of many of the canons to the <span
id="ix.i-p22.8"></span>Apostolic Constitutions.  

<span id="ix.i-p23"></span> \[The following is Dr. <span
id="ix.i-p23.1"></span>Donaldson’s <span class="sc"><span
id="ix.i-p23.2"></span>Introductory Notice</span>:—\]  

<span id="ix.i-p24"></span>  

<span id="ix.i-p25"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.i-p25.1"></span>There</span> has always existed a great diversity
of opinion as to the author and date of the <span
id="ix.i-p25.2"></span>Apostolical Constitutions Earlier writers were
inclined to assign them to the apostolic age, and to <span
id="ix.i-p25.3"></span>Clement; but much discussion ensued, and the
questions to which they give rise are still unsettled.  

<span id="ix.i-p26"></span>The most peculiar opinion in regard to them
is that of <span id="ix.i-p26.1"></span>Whiston, who devoted a volume
(vol. iii.) of his <span id="ix.i-p26.2"></span>Primitive Christianity
Revived to prove that “they are the most sacred of the canonical books
of the New Testament;” for “these sacred Christian laws or constitutions
were delivered at Jerusalem, and in Mount Sion, by our Saviour to the
eleven apostles there assembled after His resurrection.”  

<span id="ix.i-p27"></span><span id="ix.i-p27.1"></span>Krabbe, who
wrote an elaborate treatise on the origin and contents of the <span
id="ix.i-p27.2"></span>Apostolical Constitutions, tried to show that the
first seven books were written “towards the end of the third century.”
The eighth book, he thinks, must have been written at the end of the
fourth or beginning of the fifth.  

<span id="ix.i-p28"></span><span id="ix.i-p28.1"></span>Bunsen thinks
that, if we expunge a few interpolations of the fourth and fifth
centuries, “we find ourselves unmistakeably in the midst of the life of
the Church of the second and third centuries.” <span
id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530.md) “I think,” he says, “I have proved
in my analysis, more clearly than has been hitherto done, the
Ante-Nicene origin of a book, or rather books, called by an early
fiction <span id="ix.i-p29.2"></span>Apostolical Constitutions, and
consequently the still higher antiquity of the materials, both
ecclesiastical and literary, which they contain. I have shown that the
compilers made use of the Epistle of <span
id="ix.i-p29.3"></span>Barnabas, <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531.md) which belongs to the first half of
the second century; that the eighth is an extract or transcript of <span
id="ix.i-p30.3"></span>Hippolytus; and that the first six books are so
full of phrases found in the second interpolation of the Ignatian
Epistles, that their last compiler, the author of the present text, must
either have lived soon after that interpolation was made, or <span
id="ix.i-p30.4"></span>vice versa, or the interpolator and compiler must
have been one and the same person. <span
id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532.md) This last circumstance renders it
probable <span id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span
id="ix.i-Page_390"></span>that at least the first six books of the Greek
compilation, like the Ignatian forgeries, <span
id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533.md) were the produce of Asia Minor. Two
points are self-evident—their Oriental origin, and that they belong
neither to Antioch nor to Alexandria. I suppose nobody now will trace
them to Palestine.” <span id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534.md)  

<span id="ix.i-p34"></span>Modern critics are equally at sea in
determining the date of the collections of canons given at the end of
the eighth book. Most believe that some of them belong to the apostolic
age, while others are of a comparatively late date. The subject is very
fully discussed in <span id="ix.i-p34.1"></span>Krabbe.  

<span id="ix.i-p35"></span><span id="ix.i-p35.1"></span>Bovius first
gave a complete edition of the <span
id="ix.i-p35.2"></span>Constitutions (Venice, 1563), but only in a Latin
form. The Greek was first edited by the Jesuit <span
id="ix.i-p35.3"></span>Turrianus (Venice, 1563). It was reprinted
several times. <span id="ix.i-p35.4"></span>Cotelerius gave it in his
<span id="ix.i-p35.5"></span>Apostolical Fathers. In the second edition
of this work, as prepared by <span id="ix.i-p35.6"></span>Clericus
(1724), the readings of two Vienna manuscripts were given. These V.
<span id="ix.i-p35.7"></span>mss. and Oxford <span
id="ix.i-p35.8"></span>ms. of book viii. are supposed by <span
id="ix.i-p35.9"></span>Bunsen to be nearer the original than the others,
alike in what they give and in what they omit. The <span
id="ix.i-p35.10"></span>Constitutions have been edited by <span
id="ix.i-p35.11"></span>Ültzen (1853), and by <span
id="ix.i-p35.12"></span>Lagarde in <span
id="ix.i-p35.13"></span>Bunsen’s <span id="ix.i-p35.14"></span>Analecta
Ante-Nicœna, vol. ii. (1854). <span id="ix.i-p35.15"></span>Lagarde has
partially introduced readings from the Syriac, Arabic, Æthiopic, and
Coptic forms of the <span id="ix.i-p35.16"></span>Constitutions. <span
id="ix.i-p35.17"></span>Whiston devoted the second volume of his <span
id="ix.i-p35.18"></span>Primitive Christianity to the <span
id="ix.i-p35.19"></span>Constitutions and <span
id="ix.i-p35.20"></span>Canons, giving both the Greek and English. It is
his translation which we have republished, with considerable
alterations. We have not deemed it necessary to give a tithe of the
various readings, but have confined ourselves to those that seem
important. We have also given no indication of the Syriac form of the
first six books. We shall give this form by itself. The translation of
<span id="ix.i-p35.21"></span>Whiston was reprinted by <span
id="ix.i-p35.22"></span>Irah Chase, D.D., very carefully revised, with a
translation of <span id="ix.i-p35.23"></span>Krabbe’s <span
id="ix.i-p35.24"></span>Essay on the Origin and Contents of the
Constitutions, and his <span id="ix.i-p35.25"></span>Dissertation on the
Canons (New York, 1848). <span id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535.md)
