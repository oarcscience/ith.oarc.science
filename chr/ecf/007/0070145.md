#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VII.—Of the Way of Error and of Truth: that It is Single, Narrow, and Steep, and Has God for Its Guide.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.vii-p1"></span>For all those who, by the confessed
folly of others, are thought wise, being clothed with the <span
id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="iii.ii.vi.vii-Page_170"></span>appearance of virtue, grasp at
shadows and outlines, but at nothing true. Which happens on this
account, because that deceitful road which inclines to the west has many
paths, on account of the variety of pursuits and systems which are
dissimilar and varied in the life of men. For as that way of wisdom
contains something which resembles folly, as we showed in the preceding
book, so this way, which belongs altogether to folly, contains something
which resembles wisdom, and they who perceive the folly of men in
general seize upon this; and as it has its vices manifest, so it has
something which appears to resemble virtue: as it has its wickedness
open, so it has a likeness and appearance of justice. For how could the
forerunner <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129) of that way, whose
strength and power are altogether in deceit, lead men altogether into
fraud, unless he showed them some things which resembled the
truth? <span id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130) For, that His immortal
secret might be hidden, God placed in his way things which men might
despise as evil and disgraceful, that, turning away from wisdom and
truth, which they were searching for without any guide, they might fall
upon that very thing which they desired to avoid and flee from.
Therefore he points out that way of destruction and death which has many
windings, either because there are many kinds of life, or because there
are many gods who are worshipped.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.vii-p4"></span>The deceitful <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131) and treacherous guide of this way,
that there may appear to be some distinction between truth and
falsehood, good and evil, leads the luxurious in one direction, and
those who are called temperate <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132) in another; the ignorant in one
direction, the learned in another; the sluggish in one direction, the
active in another; the foolish in one direction, the philosophers in
another, and even these not in one path. For those who do not shun
pleasures or riches, he withdraws a little from this public and
frequented road; but those who either wish to follow virtue, or profess
a contempt for things, he drags over certain rugged precipices. But
nevertheless all those paths which display an appearance of honours are
not different roads, but turnings off <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133) and bypaths, which appear indeed to
be separated from that common one, and to branch off to the right, but
yet return to the same, and all lead at the very end to one issue. For
that guide unites them all, where it was necessary that the good should
be separated from the bad, the strong from the inactive, the wise from
the foolish; namely, in the worship of the gods, in which he slays them
all with one sword, because they were all foolish without any
distinction, and plunges them into death. But this way—which is that of
truth, and wisdom, and virtue, and justice, of all which there is but
one fountain, one source of strength, one abode—is both simple, <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134) because with like minds, and with
the utmost agreement, we follow and worship one God; and it is narrow,
because virtue is given to the smaller number; and steep, because
goodness, which is very high and lofty, cannot be attained to without
the greatest difficulty and labour.
