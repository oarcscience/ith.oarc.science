#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.x-p0.1"></span>Chap. IX.—Of the Disgraceful Deeds of the Gods.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1"></span>Whence did <span
id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.1"></span>Ceres bring forth <span
id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.2"></span>Proserpine, except from debauchery?
Whence did <span id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.3"></span>Latona bring forth her
twins, except from crime? <span id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.4"></span>Venus
having been subject to the lusts of gods and men, when she reigned in
Cyprus, invented the practice of courtesanship, and commanded women to
make traffic of themselves, that she might not alone be infamous. Were
the virgins themselves, <span id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.5"></span>Minerva and
<span id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.6"></span>Diana, chaste? Whence, then, did
<span id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.7"></span>Erichthonius arise? Did <span
id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.8"></span>Vulcan shed his seed upon the ground, and
was man born from that as a fungus? Or why did <span
id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.9"></span>Diana banish <span
id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.10"></span>Hippolytus either to a retired place, or
give him up to a woman, where he might pass his life in solitude among
unknown groves, and having now changed his name, might be called <span
id="iii.ii.viii.x-p1.11"></span>Virbius? What do these things signify
but impurity, which the poets do not venture to confess?
