#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXVI.—Of the Philosophers,—Namely, Epicurus and Pythagoras.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p1"></span>Since I have spoken briefly of
philosophy, now also I will speak a few things about the <span
id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-Page_236"></span>philosophers. This is especially
the doctrine of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Epicurus, that
there is no providence. And at the same time he does not deny the
existence of gods. In both respects he acts contrary to reason. For if
there are gods, it follows that there is a providence. For otherwise we
can form no intelligible idea of God, for it is His peculiar province to
foresee. <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) But <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p2.2"></span>Epicurus says He takes no care about
anything. Therefore He disregards not only the affairs of men, but also
heavenly things. How, therefore, or from what, do you affirm that He
exists? For when you have taken away the divine providence and care, it
would naturally follow that you should altogether deny the existence of
God; whereas now you have left Him in name, but in reality you have
taken Him away. Whence, then, did the world derive its origin, if God
takes no care of anything? There are, he says, minute atoms, which can
neither be seen nor touched, and from the fortuitous meeting of these
all things arose, and are continually arising. If they are neither seen
nor perceived by any part of the body, how could you know of their
existence? In the next place, if they exist, with what mind do they meet
together to effect anything? If they are smooth, they cannot cohere: if
they are hooked and angular, then they are divisible; for hooks and
angles project, and can be cut off. But these things are senseless and
unprofitable. Why should I mention that he also makes souls capable of
extinction? who is refuted not only by all philosophers and general
persuasion, but also by the answers of bards, by the predictions of the
Sibyls, and lastly, by the divine voices of the prophets themselves; so
that it is wonderful that <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p2.3"></span>Epicurus alone existed, who should
place the condition of man on a level with the flocks and beasts.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p3"></span>What of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>Pythagoras, who was first called a
philosopher, who judged that souls were indeed immortal, but that they
passed into other bodies, either of cattle, or of birds, or of beasts?
Would it not have been better that they should be destroyed, together
with their bodies, than thus to be condemned to pass into the bodies of
other animals? Would it not be better not to exist at all, than, after
having had the form of a man, to live as a swine or a dog? And the
foolish man, to gain credit for his saying, said that he himself had
been <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p3.2"></span>Euphorbus in the Trojan
war, and that, when he had been slain, he passed into other figures of
animals, and at last became <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxii-p3.3"></span>Pythagoras. O happy man! to whom
alone so great a memory was given; or rather unhappy, who, when changed
into a sheep, was not permitted to be ignorant of what he was! And would
to Heaven that he alone had been thus senseless! He found also some to
believe him, and some indeed among the learned, <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) to whom the inheritance of folly
passed.
