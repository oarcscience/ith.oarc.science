#### <span id="iii.iii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIV.—Why God Made Man.

<span id="iii.iii.xiv-p1"></span>It follows that I show for what purpose
God made man himself. As He contrived the world for the sake of man, so
He formed man himself on His own account, as it were a priest of a
divine temple, a spectator of His works and of heavenly objects. For he
is the only being who, since he is intelligent and capable of reason, is
able to understand God, to admire His works, and perceive His energy and
power; for on this account he is furnished with judgment, intelligence,
and prudence. On this account he alone, beyond the other living
creatures, has been made with an upright body and attitude, so that he
seems to have been raised up for the contemplation of his Parent. <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728) On this account he alone has
received language, and a tongue the interpreter of his thought, that he
may be able to declare the majesty of his Lord. Lastly, for this cause
all things were placed under his control, that he himself might be under
the control of God, their Maker and Creator. If God, therefore, designed
man to be a worshipper of Himself, and on this account gave him so much
honour, that he might rule over all things; it is plainly most just that
he should worship Him <span id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729) who
bestowed upon him such great gifts, and love man, who is united with us
in the participation of the divine justice. For it is not right that a
worshipper of God should he injured by a worshipper of God. From which
it is understood that man was made for the sake of religion and justice.
And of this matter <span id="iii.iii.xiv-p3.6"></span>Marcus Tullius is
a witness in his books respecting the Laws, since he thus speaks: <span
id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730) “But of all things concerning which
learned men dispute, nothing is of greater consequence than that it
should be altogether understood that we are born to justice.” And if
this is most true, it follows that God will have all men to be just,
<span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="iii.iii.xiv-Page_272"></span>that is, to have God and man as objects
of their affection; to honour God in truth as a Father, and to love man
as a brother: for in these two things the whole of justice is comprised.
But he who either fails to acknowledge God or acts injuriously to man,
lives unjustly and contrary to his nature, and in this manner disturbs
the divine institution and law.
