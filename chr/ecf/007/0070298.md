#### <span id="iii.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XI.—Of the Intestines in Man, and Their Use.

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p1"></span>It necessarily follows that I should
begin to speak of the inward parts also, to which has been assigned not
beauty, because they are concealed from view, but incredible utility,
since it was necessary that this earthly body should be nourished with
some moisture from food and drink, as the earth itself is by showers and
frosts. The most provident Artificer placed in the middle of it a
receptacle for articles of food, by means of which, when digested and
liquefied, it might distribute the vital juices to all the members. But
since man is composed of body and soul, that receptacle of which I have
spoken above affords nourishment only to the body; to the soul, in
truth, He has given another abode. For He has made a kind of intestines
soft and thin, <span id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) which we call
the lungs, into which the breath might pass by an alternate
interchange; <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886.md) and He did not
form this after the fashion of the uterus, lest the breath should all at
once be poured forth, or at once inflate it. And on this account He did
not make it a full intestine, <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887.md)
but capable of being inflated, and admitting the air, so that it might
gradually receive the breath; while the vital air is spread through that
thinness, and might again gradually give it back, while it spreads
itself forth from it: for the very alternation of blowing and
breathing, <span id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md) and the process of
respiration, support life in the body.  

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p6"></span>Since, therefore, there are in man two
receptacles,—one of the air which nourishes the soul, <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889.md) the other of the food which
nourishes the body,—there must be two tubes <span
id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890.md) through the neck for food, and for
breath, the upper of which leads from the mouth to the belly, the lower
from the nostrils to the lungs. And the plan and nature of these are
different: for the passage which is from the mouth has been made soft,
and which when closed always adheres <span
id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891.md) to itself, as the month itself;
since drink and food, being corporeal, make for themselves a space for
passage, by moving aside and opening the gullet. The breath, on the
other hand, which is incorporeal and thin, because it was unable to make
for itself a space, has received an open way, which is called the
windpipe. This is composed of flexible and soft bones, as though of
rings fitted together after the manner of a hemlock stalk, <span
id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892.md) and adhering together; and this
passage is always open. For the breath can have no cessation in passing;
because it, which is always passing to and fro, is checked as by a kind
of obstacle through means of a portion of a member usefully sent down
from the brain, and which is called the uvula, lest, drawn by
pestilential air, <span id="page_293">p. 293</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xi-Page_293"></span>it should come with impetuosity and spoil
the slightness <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893.md) of its abode,
or bring the whole violence of the injury upon the inner receptacles.
And on this account also the nostrils are slightly open, which are
therefore so named, because either smell or breath does not cease to
flow <span id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md) through these, which
are, as it were, the doors of this tube. Yet this breathing-tube lies
open <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895.md) not only to the
nostrils, but also to the mouth in the extreme regions of the palate,
where the risings of <span id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896.md) the
jaws, looking towards the uvula, begin to raise themselves into a
swelling. And the reason of this arrangement is not obscure: for we
should not have the power of speaking if the windpipe were open to the
nostrils only, as the path of the gullet is to the mouth only; nor could
the breath proceeding from it cause the voice, without the service of
the tongue.  

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p15"></span>Therefore the divine skill opened a way
for the voice from that breathing-tube, so that the tongue might be able
to discharge its office, and by its strokes divide into words the
even <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md) course of the voice
itself. And this passage, if by any means it is intercepted, must
necessarily cause dumbness. For he is assuredly mistaken, whoever thinks
that there is any other cause why men are dumb. For they are not
tongue-tied, as is commonly believed; but they pour forth that vocal
breath through the nostrils, as though bellowing, <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md) because there is either no passage
at all for the voice to the mouth, or it is not so open as to be able to
send forth the full voice. And this generally comes to pass by nature;
sometimes also it happens by accident that this entrance is blocked up
and does not transmit the voice to the tongue, and thus makes those who
can speak dumb. And when this happens, the hearing also must necessarily
be blocked up; so that because it cannot emit the voice, it is also
incapable of admitting it. Therefore this passage has been opened for
the purpose of speaking. It also affords this advantage, that in
frequenting the bath, <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899.md) because
the nostrils are not able to endure the heat, the hot air is taken in by
the mouth; also, if phlegm contracted by cold shall have happened to
stop up the breathing pores of the nostrils, we may be able to draw the
air through the mouth, lest, if the passage <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900.md) should be obstructed, the breath
should be stifled. But the food being received into the stomach, and
mixed with the moisture of the drink, when it has now been digested by
the heat, its juice, being in an indescribable manner diffused through
the limbs, bedews and invigorates the whole body.  

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p20"></span>The manifold coils also of the
intestines, and their length rolled together on themselves, and yet
fastened with one band, are a wonderful work of God. For when the
stomach has sent forth from itself the food softened, it is gradually
thrust forth through those windings of the intestines, so that whatever
of the moisture by which the body is nourished is in them, is divided to
all the members. And yet, lest in any place it should happen to adhere
and remain fixed, which might have taken place on account of the
turnings of the coils, <span id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901.md) which
often turn back to themselves, and which could not have happened without
injury, He has spread over <span id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902.md)
these from within a thicker juice, that the secretions of the belly
might more easily work their way through the slippery substance to their
outlets. It is also a most skilful arrangement, that the bladder, which
birds do not use, though it is separated from the intestines, and has no
tube by which it may draw the urine from them, is nevertheless filled
and distended with moisture. And it is not difficult to see how this
comes to pass. For the parts of the intestines which receive the food
and drink from the belly are more open than the other coils, and much
more delicate. These entwine themselves around and encompass the
bladder; and when the meat and the drink have arrived at these parts in
a mixed state, the excrement becomes more solid, and passes through, but
all the moisture is strained through those tender parts, <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903.md) and the bladder, the membrane of
which is equally fine and delicate, absorbs and collects it, so as to
send it forth where nature has opened an outlet.
