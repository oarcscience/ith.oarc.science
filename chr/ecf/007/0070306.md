#### <span id="iii.iv.xix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIX.—Of the Soul, and It Given by God.

<span id="iii.iv.xix-p1"></span>A question also may arise respecting
this, whether the soul is produced from the father, or rather from the
mother, or indeed from both. But I think that this judgment is to be
formed as though in a doubtful matter. <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937) For nothing is true of these three
opinions, because souls are produced neither from both nor from either.
For a body may be produced from a body, since something is contributed
from both; but a soul cannot be produced from souls, because nothing can
depart from a slight and incomprehensible subject. Therefore the manner
of the production of souls belongs entirely to God alone.  

> <span id="iii.iv.xix-p2.2"></span> “In fine, we are all sprung from a
> heavenly seed, all have that same Father.”  

<span id="iii.iv.xix-p3"></span>as <span
id="iii.iv.xix-p3.1"></span>Lucretius <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938) says. For nothing but what is
mortal can be generated from mortals. Nor ought he to be deemed a father
who in no way <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xix-Page_299"></span>perceives that he has transmitted or
breathed a soul from his own; nor, if he perceives it, comprehends in
his mind when or in what manner that effect is produced.  

<span id="iii.iv.xix-p5"></span>From this it is evident that souls are
not given by parents, but by one and the same God and Father of all, who
alone has the law and method of their birth, since He alone produces
them. For the part of the earthly parent is nothing more than with a
sense of pleasure to emit the moisture of the body, in which is the
material of birth, or to receive it; and to this work man’s power is
limited, <span id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939) nor has he any
further power. Therefore men wish for the birth of sons, because they do
not themselves bring it about. Everything beyond this is the work of
God,—namely, the conception itself, and the moulding of the body, and
the breathing in of life, and the bringing forth in safety, and whatever
afterwards contributes to the preservation of man: it is His gift that
we breathe, that we live, and are vigorous. For, besides that we owe it
to His bounty that we are safe in body, and that He supplies us with
nourishment from various sources, He also gives to man wisdom, which no
earthly father can by any means give; and therefore it often happens
that foolish sons are born from wise parents, and wise sons from foolish
parents, which some persons attribute to fate and the stars. But this is
not now the time to discuss the subject of fate. It is sufficient to say
this, that even if the stars hold together the efficacy of all things,
it is nevertheless certain that all things are done by God, who both
made and set in order the stars themselves. They are therefore senseless
who detract this power from God, and assign it to His work.  

<span id="iii.iv.xix-p7"></span>He would have it, therefore, to be in
our own power, whether we use or do not use this divine and excellent
gift of God. For, having granted this, He bound man himself by the
mystery <span id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940) of virtue, by which
he might be able to gain life. For great is the power, great the reason,
great the mysterious purpose of man; and if any one shall not abandon
this, nor betray his fidelity and devotedness, he must be happy: he, in
short, to sum up the matter in few words, must of necessity resemble
God. For he is in error whosoever judges of <span
id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941) man by his flesh. For this
worthless body <span id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942) with which we
are clothed is the receptacle of man. <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943) For man himself, can neither be
touched, nor looked upon, nor grasped, because he lies hidden within
this body, which is seen. And if he shall be more luxurious and delicate
in this life than its nature demands, if he shall despise virtue, and
give himself to the pursuit of fleshly lusts, he will fall and be
pressed down to the earth; but if (as his duty is) he shall readily and
constantly maintain his position, which is right for him, and he has
rightly obtained, <span id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944) —if he
shall not be enslaved to the earth, which he ought to trample upon and
overcome, he will gain eternal life.
