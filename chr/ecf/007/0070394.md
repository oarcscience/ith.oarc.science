<span id="vi.ii.xix"></span>

#### <span id="vi.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>from the twenty-first and twenty-second chapters.

<span id="vi.ii.xix-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>16. “And
the city is placed in a square.”\] The city which he says is squared, he
says also is resplendent with gold and precious stones, and has a sacred
street, and a river through the midst of it, and the tree of life on
either side, bearing twelve manner of fruits throughout the twelve
months; and that the light of the sun is not there, because the Lamb is
the light of it; and that its gates were of single pearls; and that
there were three gates on each of the four sides, and that they could
not be shut. I say, in respect of the square city, he shows forth the
united multitude of the saints, in whom the faith could by no means
waver. As <span id="vi.ii.xix-p1.2"></span>Noah is commanded to make the
ark of squared beams, <span id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312) that it
might resist the force of the deluge, by the precious stones he sets
forth the holy men who cannot waver in persecution, who could not be
moved either by the tempest of persecutors, or be dissolved from the
true faith by the force of the rain, because they are associated of pure
gold, of whom the city of the great King is adorned. Moreover, the
streets set forth their hearts purified from all uncleanness,
transparent with glowing light, that the Lord may justly walk up and
down in them. The river of life sets forth that the grace of spiritual
doctrine flowed through the minds of the faithful, and that manifold
flourishing forms of odours germinated therein. The tree of life on
either bank sets forth the Advent of Christ, according to the flesh, who
satisfied the peoples wasted with famine, <span
id="vi.ii.xix-p2.2"></span>that received life from One by the wood of
the Cross, with the announcement of God’s word. And <span
id="vi.ii.xix-p2.3"></span>in that he says that the sun is not necessary
in the city, <span id="vi.ii.xix-p2.4"></span>he shows, evidently, that
the Creator as the immaculate light shines in the midst of it, whose
brightness no mind has been able to conceive, nor tongue to tell.  

<span id="vi.ii.xix-p3"></span>In that he says there are three gates
placed on each of the four sides, of single pearls, I think that these
are the four virtues, <span id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313) to wit,
prudence, fortitude, justice, temperance, which are associated with one
another. And, being involved <span id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span
id="vi.ii.xix-Page_360"></span>together, they make the number twelve.
But the twelve gates we believe to be the number of the apostles, who,
shining in the four virtues as precious stones, manifesting the light of
their doctrine among the saints, cause it to enter the celestial city,
that by intercourse with them the choir of angels may be gladdened. And
that the gates cannot be shut, it is evidently shown that the doctrine
of the apostles can be separated from rectitude by no tempest of
contradiction. Even though the floods of the nations and the vain
superstitions of heretics should revolt against their true faith, they
are overcome, and shall be dissolved as the foam, because Christ is the
Rock <span id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314) by which, and on which,
the Church is founded. <span id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315) And
thus it is overcome by no traces of maddened men. Therefore they are not
to be heard who assure themselves that there is to be an earthly reign
of a thousand years; who think, <span id="vi.ii.xix-p6.2"></span>that is
to say, with the heretic <span
id="vi.ii.xix-p6.3"></span>Cerinthus. <span
id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316) For the kingdom of Christ is now
eternal in the saints, although the glory of the saints shall be
manifested after the resurrection.
