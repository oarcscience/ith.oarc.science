<span id="iii.iv.xviii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.iv.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVIII.—Of the Soul and the Mind, and Their Affections.

<span id="iii.iv.xviii-p1"></span>There follows another, and in itself
an inexplicable inquiry: Whether the soul and the mind are the same, or
there be one faculty by which we live, and another by which we perceive
and have discernment. <span id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md) There
are not wanting arguments on either side. For they who say that they are
one faculty make use of this argument, that we cannot live without
perception, nor perceive without life, and therefore that that which is
incapable of separation cannot be different; but that whatever it is, it
has the office of living and the method of perception. On which account
two <span id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) Epicurean poets speak of
the mind and the soul indifferently. But they who say that they are
different argue in this way: That the mind is one thing, and the soul
another, may be understood from this, that the mind may be extinguished
while the soul is uninjured, which is accustomed to happen in the case
of the insane; also, that the soul is put to rest <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) by death, the mind by sleep, and
indeed in such a manner that it is not only ignorant of what is taking
place, <span id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) or where it is, but it
is even deceived by the contemplation of false objects. And how this
takes place cannot accurately be perceived; why it takes place can be
perceived. For we can by no means rest unless the mind is kept occupied
by the similitudes <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md) of
visions. But the mind lies hid, oppressed with sleep, as fire
buried <span id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928.md) by ashes drawn over
it; but if you stir it a little it again blazes, and, as it were, wakes
up. <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md) Therefore it is called
away by images, <span id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) until the
limbs, bedewed with sleep, are invigorated; for the body while the
perception is awake, although it lies motionless, yet is not at rest,
because the perception burns in it, and vibrates as a flame, and keeps
all the limbs bound to itself.  

<span id="iii.iv.xviii-p10"></span>But when the mind is transferred from
its application to the contemplation of images, then at length the whole
body is resolved into rest. But the mind is transferred from dark
thought, when, under the influence of darkness, it has begun to be alone
with itself. While it is intent upon those things concerning which it is
reflecting, sleep suddenly creeps on, and the thought itself
imperceptibly turns aside to the nearest appearances: <span
id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) thus it begins also to see those
things which it had placed before its eyes. Then it proceeds further,
and finds diversions <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md) for
itself, that it may not interrupt the most healthy repose of the body.
For as the mind is diverted in the day by true sights, so that it does
not sleep; so is it diverted in the night by false sights, so that it is
not aroused. For if it perceives no images, it will follow of necessity
either that it is awake, or that it is asleep in perpetual death.
Therefore the system of dreaming has been given by God for the sake of
sleeping; and, indeed, it has been given to all animals in common; but
this especially to man, that when God gave this system on account of
rest, He left to Himself the power of teaching man future events by
means of the dream. <span id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md) For
narratives often testify that there have been dreams which have had an
immediate and a remarkable accomplishment, <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md) and the answers of our prophets
have been after the character of a dream. <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) On which account they are not
always true, nor always false, as <span
id="iii.iv.xviii-p15.3"></span>Virgil testified, <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) who supposed that there were two
gates for the passage of dreams. But those which are false are seen for
the sake of sleeping; those which are true are sent by God, that by this
revelation we may learn impending goods or evils.
