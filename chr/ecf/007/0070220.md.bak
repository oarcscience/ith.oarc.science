#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXII.—Of the Sects of Philosophers, and Their Disagreement.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxviii-p1"></span>To this is added, that it <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) is not uniform; but being divided
into sects, and scattered into many and discordant opinions, it has no
fixed state. For since they all separately attack and harass one
another, and there is none of them which is not condemned of folly in
the judgment of the rest, while the members are plainly at variance with
one another, the whole body of philosophy is brought to destruction.
Hence the Academy afterwards originated. For when the leading men of
that sect saw that philosophy was altogether overthrown by philosophers
mutually opposing each other, they undertook war against all, that they
might destroy all the arguments of all; while they themselves assert
nothing except one thing—that nothing can be known. Thus, having taken
away knowledge, they overthrew the ancient philosophy. But they did not
even themselves retain the name of philosophers, since they admitted
their ignorance, because to be ignorant of all things is not only not
the part of a philosopher, but not even of a man. Thus the philosophers,
because they have no defence, must destroy one another with mutual
wounds, and philosophy itself must altogether consume and put an end to
itself by its own arms. But they say it is only natural philosophy which
thus gives way. How is it with moral? Does that rest on any firm
foundation? Let us see whether philosophers are agreed in this part at
any rate, which relates to the condition of life.
