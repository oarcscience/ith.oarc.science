#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXII.—Arguments of Unbelievers Against the Incarnation of Jesus.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxii-p1"></span>I have now confirmed, as I imagine,
the things which are thought false and incredible by those who are not
instructed in the true knowledge of heavenly learning. But, however,
that we may refute those also who are too wise, not without injury to
themselves, and who detract from the credit due to divine things, let us
disprove their error, that they may at length perceive that the fact
ought to have been as we show that it actually was. And although with
good judges either testimonies are of sufficient weight without
arguments, or arguments without testimonies, we, however, are not
content with the one or the other, since we are supplied with both, that
we may not leave room for any one of depraved ingenuity either to
misunderstand or to dispute on the opposite side. They say that it was
impossible for anything to be withdrawn <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) from an immortal nature. They say, in
short, that it was unworthy of God to be willing to become man, and to
burthen Himself with the infirmity of flesh; to become subject of His
own accord to sufferings, to pain, and death: as though it had not been
easy for Him to show Himself to men without <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md) the weakness incident to a body, and
to teach them righteousness (if He so wished) with greater authority, as
of one who acknowledged <span id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) Himself
to be God. For in that case all would have obeyed the heavenly precepts,
if the influence and power of God enjoining them had been united with
them. Why, then (they say), did He not come as God to teach men? why did
He render Himself so humble and weak, that it was possible for Him both
to be despised by men and to be visited with punishment? why did He
suffer violence from those who are weak and mortal? why did He not repel
by strength, or avoid by His divine knowledge, <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md) the hands of men? why did He not at
least in His very death reveal His majesty? but He was led as one
without strength to trial, was condemned as one who was guilty, was put
to death as one who was mortal. I will carefully refute these things,
nor will I permit any one to be in error. For these things were done by
a great and wonderful plan; and he who shall understand this, will not
only cease to wonder that God was tortured by men, but also will easily
see that it could not have been believed that he was God if those very
things which he censures had not been done.
