#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chap. III.—Of Nature, and of the World; And a Censure of the Stoics and Epicureans.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p1"></span>And since we are speaking of the
errors of philosophers, the Stoics divide nature into two parts—the one
which effects, the other which affords itself tractable for action. They
say that in the former is contained all the power of perception, in the
latter the material, and that the one cannot act without the other. How
can that which handles and that which is handled be one and the same
thing? If any one should say that the potter is the same as the clay, or
that the clay is the same as the potter, would he not plainly appear to
be mad? But these men comprehend under the one name of nature two things
which are most widely different, God and the world, the Maker and the
work; and say that the one can do nothing without the other, as though
God were mixed up in nature with the world. For sometimes they so mix
them together, that God Himself is the mind of the world, and that the
world is the body of God; as though the world and God began to exist at
the same time, and God did not Himself make the world. And they
themselves also confess this at other times, when they say that it was
made for the sake of men, and that God could, if He willed it, exist
without the world, inasmuch as God is the divine and eternal mind,
separate and free from a body. And since they were unable to understand
His power and majesty, they mixed Him <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) with the world, that is, with His
own work. Whence is that saying of <span
id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p2.4"></span>Virgil: <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p3.2"></span> “A spirit whose celestial
> flame  
> Glows in each member of the frame,  
> And stirs the mighty whole.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p4"></span><span id="page_197">p. 197</span>
<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-Page_197"></span>What, then, becomes of their
own saying, that the world was both made and is governed by the divine
providence? For if He made the world, it follows that He existed without
the world; if He governs it, it is plain that it is not as the mind
governs the body, but as a master rules the house, as a pilot the ship,
as a charioteer the chariot. Nor, however, are they mixed with those
things which they govern. For if all these things which we see are
members of God, then God is rendered insensible by them, since the
members are without sensibility, and mortal, since we see that the
members are mortal.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p5"></span>I can enumerate how often lands
shaken by sudden motions <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298.md) have
either opened or sunk down precipitously; how often cities and islands
have been overwhelmed by waves, and gone into the deep; marshes have
inundated fruitful plains, rivers and pools have been dried up; <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md) mountains also have either fallen
precipitously, or have been levelled with plains. Many districts, and
the foundations of many mountains, are laid waste by latent and internal
fire. And this is not enough, if God does not spare His own members,
unless it is permitted man also to have some power over the body of God.
Seas are built up, mountains are cut down, and the innermost bowels of
the earth are dug out to draw forth riches. Why, should I say that we
cannot even plough without lacerating the divine body? So that we are at
once wicked and impious in doing violence to the members of God. Does
God, then, suffer His body to be harassed, and endure to weaken Himself,
or permit this to be done by man? Unless by chance that divine
intelligence which is mixed with the world, and with all parts of the
world, abandoned the first outer aspect <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) of the earth, and plunged itself
into the lowest depths, that it might be sensible of no pain from
continual laceration. But if this is trifling and absurd, then they
themselves were as devoid of intelligence as those are who have not
perceived that the divine spirit is everywhere diffused, and that all
things are held together by it, not however in such a manner that God,
who is incorruptible, should Himself be mixed with heavy and corruptible
elements. Therefore that is more correct which they derived from <span
id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p8.2"></span>Plato, that the world was made by God,
and is also governed by His providence. It was therefore befitting that
<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p8.3"></span>Plato, and those who held the same
opinion, should teach and explain what was the cause, what the reason,
for the contriving of so great a work; why or for the sake of whom He
made it.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p9"></span>But the Stoics also say the world
was made for the sake of men. I hear. But <span
id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p9.1"></span>Epicurus is ignorant on what account or
who made men themselves. For <span
id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p9.2"></span>Lucretius, when he said that the world
was not made by the gods, thus spoke: <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md)  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p10.2"></span> “To say, again, that for the
> sake of men they have willed to set in order the glorious nature of
> the world”—  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p11"></span>then he introduced:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p11.1"></span> “Is sheer folly. For what
> advantage can our gratitude bestow on immortal and blessed beings,
> that for our, sake they should take in hand to administer aught?”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p12"></span>And with good reason. For they
brought forward no reason why the human race was created or established
by God. It is our business to set forth the mystery of the world and
man, of which they, being destitute, were able neither to reach nor see
the shrine of truth. Therefore, as I said a little before, when they had
assumed that which was true, that is, that the world was made by God,
and was made for the sake of men, yet, since their argument failed them
in the consequences, they were unable to defend that which they had
assumed. In fine, <span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p12.1"></span>Plato, that he
might not make the work of God weak and subject to ruin, said that it
would remain for ever. If it was made for the sake of men, and so made
as to be eternal, why then are not they on whose account it was made
eternal? If they are mortal on account of whom it was made, it must also
itself be mortal and subject to dissolution, for it is not of more value
than those for whose sake it was made. But if his argument <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) were consistent, he would
understand that it must perish because it was made, and that nothing can
remain for ever except that which cannot be touched.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p14"></span>But he who says that it was not
made for the sake of men has no argument. For if he says that the
Creator contrived these works of such magnitude on His own account, why
then were we produced? Why do we enjoy the world itself? what means the
creation of the human race, and of the other living creatures? why do we
intercept the advantages of others? why, in short, do we grow, decrease,
and perish? What reason is implied in our production itself? what in our
perpetual succession? Doubtless God wished us to be seen, and to frame,
as it were, impressions <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) with
various representations of Himself, with which He might delight Himself.
Nevertheless, if it were so, He would esteem living creatures as His
care, and especially man, to whose command He made all things subject.
But with regard to those who say that the world always existed: I omit
that point, that itself cannot exist without some beginning, from which
they are unable to extricate themselves; but I <span id="page_198">p.
198</span> <span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-Page_198"></span>say this, if the
world always existed, it can have no systematic arrangement. <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) For what could arrangement have
effected in that which never had a beginning? For before anything is
done or arranged, there is need of counsel that it may be determined how
it should be done; nor can anything be done without the foresight of a
settled plan. Therefore the plan precedes every work. Therefore that
which has not been made has no plan. But the world has a plan by which
it both exists and is governed; therefore also it was made: if it was
made, it will also be destroyed. Let them therefore assign a reason, if
they can, why it was either made in the beginning or will hereafter be
destroyed.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p17"></span>And because <span
id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p17.1"></span>Epicurus or <span
id="iii.ii.vii.iii-p17.2"></span>Democritus was unable to teach this, he
said that it was produced of its own accord, the seeds <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) coming together in all directions;
and that when these are again resolved, discord and destruction will
follow. Therefore he perverted <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) that which he had correctly seen,
and by his ignorance of system entirely overthrew the whole system, and
reduced the world, and all things which are done in it, to the likeness
of a most trifling dream, if no plan exists in human affairs. But since
the world and all its parts, as we see, are governed by a wonderful
plan; since the framing of the heaven, and the course of the stars and
of the heavenly bodies, which is harmonious <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) even in variety itself, the
constant and wonderful arrangement of the seasons, the varied
fruitfulness of the lands, the level plains, the defences and heapings
up of mountains, the verdure and productiveness of the woods, the most
salubrious bursting forth of fountains, the seasonable overflowings of
rivers, the rich and abundant flowing <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) in of the sea, the opposite and
useful breathing <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) of the
winds, and all things, are fixed with the greatest regularity: who is so
blind as to think that they were made without a cause, in which a
wonderful disposition of most provident arrangement shines forth? If,
therefore, nothing at all exists nor is done without a cause; if the
providence of the Supreme God is manifest from the disposition of
things, His excellency from their greatness, and His power from their
government: therefore they are dull and mad who have said that there is
no providence. I should not disapprove if they denied the existence of
gods with this object, that they might affirm the existence of one; but
when they did it with this intent, that they might say that there is
none, he who does not think that they were senseless is himself
senseless.
