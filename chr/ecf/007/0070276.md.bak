#### <span id="iii.iii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIII.—Of the Advantage and Use of the World and of the Seasons.

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p1"></span>If any one considers the whole
government of the world, he will certainly understand how true is the
opinion of the Stoics, who say that the world was made on our account.
For all the things of which the world is composed, and which it produces
from itself, are adapted to the use of man. Man, accordingly, uses fire
for the purpose of warmth and light, and of softening his food, and for
the working of iron; he uses <span id="page_270">p. 270</span> <span
id="iii.iii.xiii-Page_270"></span>springs for drinking, and for baths;
he uses rivers for irrigating the fields, and assigning boundaries to
countries; he uses the earth for receiving a variety of fruits, the
hills for planting vineyards, the mountains for the use of trees and
firewood, <span id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) the plains for
crops of grain; he uses the sea not only for commerce, and for receiving
supplies from distant countries, but also for abundance of every kind of
fish. But if he makes use of these elements to which he is nearest,
there is no doubt that he uses the heaven also, since the offices even
of heavenly things are regulated for the fertility of the earth from
which we live. The sun, with its ceaseless courses and unequal
intervals, <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) completes its
annual circles, and either at his rising draws forth the day for labour,
or at his setting brings on the night for repose; and at one time by his
departure farther towards the south, at another time by his approach
nearer towards the north, he causes the vicissitudes of winter and
summer, so that both by the moistures and frosts of winter the earth
becomes enriched for fruitfulness, and by the heats of summer either the
produce of grass <span id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) is hardened
by maturity, or that which is in moist places, being seethed and heated,
becomes ripened. The moon also, which governs the time of night,
regulates her monthly courses by the alternate loss and recovery of
light, <span id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) and by the brightness
of her shining illumines the nights obscure with gloomy darkness, so
that journeys in the summer heat, and expeditions, and works, may be
performed without labour and inconvenience; since  

> <span id="iii.iii.xiii-p5.2"></span> “By night the light stubble, by
> night  
> The dry meadows are better mown.” <span
> id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md)  

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p7"></span>The other heavenly bodies also, either
at their rising or setting, supply favourable times <span
id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md) by their fixed positions. <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721.md) Moreover, they also afford guidance
to ships, that they may not wander through the boundless deep with
uncertain course, since the pilot duly observing them arrives at the
harbour of the shore at which he aims. <span
id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722.md) Clouds are attracted by the breath
of the winds, that the fields of sown grain may be watered with showers,
that the vines may abound with produce, and the trees with fruits. And
these things are exhibited by a succession of changes throughout the
year, that nothing may at any time be wanting by which the life of men
is sustained. But <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723.md) (it is
said) the same earth nourishes the other living creatures, and by the
produce of the same even the dumb animals are fed. Has not God laboured
also for the sake of the dumb animals? By no means; because they are
void of reason. On the contrary, we understand that even these
themselves in the same manner were made by God for the use of man,
partly for food, partly for clothing, partly to assist him in his work;
so that it is manifest that the divine providence wished to furnish and
adorn the life of men with an abundance of objects and resources, and on
this account He both filled the air with birds, and the sea with fishes,
and the earth with quadrupeds. But the Academics, arguing against the
Stoics, are accustomed to ask why, if God made all things for the sake
of men, many things are found even opposed, and hostile, and injurious
to us, as well in the sea as on the land. And the Stoics, without any
regard to the truth, most foolishly repelled this. For they say that
there are many things among natural productions, <span
id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724.md) and reckoned among animals, the
utility of which hitherto <span id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725.md)
escapes notice, but that this is discovered in process of the times, as
necessity and use have already discovered many things which were unknown
in former ages. What utility, then, can be discovered in mice, in
beetles, in serpents, which are troublesome and pernicious to man? Is it
that some medicine lies concealed in them? If there is any, it will at
some time be found out, namely, as a remedy against evils, whereas they
complain that it is altogether evil. They say that the viper, when burnt
and reduced to ashes, is a remedy for the bite of the same beast. How
much better had it been that it should not exist at all, than that a
remedy should be required against it drawn from itself?  

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p14"></span>They might then have answered with
more conciseness and truth after this manner. When God had formed man as
it were His own image, that which was the completion of His workmanship,
He breathed wisdom into him alone, so that he might bring all things
into subjection to his own authority and government, and make use of all
the advantages of the world. And yet He set before him both good and
evil things, inasmuch as He gave to him wisdom, the whole nature of
which is employed in discerning things evil and good: for no one can
choose better things, and know what is good, unless he at the same time
knows to reject and avoid the things which are evil. <span
id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726.md) They are both mutually connected
with each other, so that, the one being taken away, the other must also
be taken away. Therefore, good and evil things being set before it, then
at length wisdom discharges its office, and desires <span
id="page_271">p. 271</span> <span id="iii.iii.xiii-Page_271"></span>the
good for usefulness, but rejects the evil for safety. Therefore, as
innumerable good things have been given which it might enjoy, so also
have evils, against which it might guard. For if there is no evil, no
danger—nothing, in short, which can injure man—all the material of
wisdom is taken away, and will be unnecessary for man. For if only good
things are placed in sight, what need is there of reflection, of
understanding, of knowledge, of reason? since, wherever he shall extend
his hand, that is befitting and adapted to nature; so that if any one
should wish to place a most exquisite dinner before infants, who as yet
have no taste, it is plain that each will desire that to which either
impulse, or hunger, or even accident, shall attract them; and whatever
they shall take, it will be useful and salutary to them. What injury
will it therefore be for them always to remain as they are, and always
to be infants and unacquainted with affairs? But if you add a mixture
either of bitter things, or things useless, or even poisonous, they are
plainly deceived through their ignorance of good and evil, unless wisdom
is added to them, by which they may have the rejection of evil things
and the choice of good things.  

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p16"></span>You see, therefore, that we have
greater need of wisdom on account of evils; and unless these things had
been proposed to us, we should not be a rational animal. But if this
account is true, which the Stoics were in no manner able to see, that
argument also of <span id="iii.iii.xiii-p16.1"></span>Epicurus is done
away. God, he says, either wishes to take away evils, and is unable; or
He is able, and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He
is both willing and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble,
which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is able and
unwilling, He is envious, which is equally at variance with God; if He
is neither willing nor able, He is both envious and feeble, and
therefore not God; if He is both willing and able, which alone is
suitable to God, from what source then are evils? or why does He not
remove them? I know that many of the philosophers, who defend
providence, are accustomed to be disturbed by this argument, and are
almost driven against their will to admit that God takes no interest in
anything, which <span id="iii.iii.xiii-p16.2"></span>Epicurus especially
aims at; but having examined the matter, we easily do away with this
formidable argument. For God is able to do whatever He wishes, and there
is no weakness or envy in God. He is able, therefore, to take away
evils; but He does not wish to do so, and yet He is not on that account
envious. For on this account He does not take them away, because He at
the same time gives wisdom, as I have shown; and there is more of
goodness and pleasure in wisdom than of annoyance in evils. For wisdom
causes us even to know God, and by that knowledge to attain to
immortality, which is the chief good. Therefore, unless we first know
evil, we shall be unable to know good. But <span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p16.3"></span>Epicurus did not see this, nor did any
other, that if evils are taken away, wisdom is in like manner taken
away; and that no traces of virtue remain in man, the nature of which
consists in enduring and overcoming the bitterness of evils. And thus,
for the sake of a slight gain <span id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md)
in the taking away of evils, we should be deprived of a good, which is
very great, and true, and peculiar to us. It is plain, therefore, that
all things are proposed for the sake of man, as well evils as also
goods.
