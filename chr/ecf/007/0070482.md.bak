id="fr_4222"></span>[4223](#fn_4222.md) with thousands of cherubim praising
Thee, and ten thousands of seraphim sanctifying Thee, we draw near,
adore, thank, and glorify Thee always, O Lord of all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p16"></span>On commemorations and Fridays.  

<span id="xii.iv-p17"></span>Thy name, great and holy, illustrious and

glorify, O Lord of all.

sweet fragrance of the sweetness of Thy love; illumined are our souls,
through the knowledge of Thy truth: may we be rendered worthy of
receiving the manifestation of Thy beloved from Thy holy heavens: there
shall we render thanks unto Thee, and, in the meantime, glorify Thee
without ceasing in Thy Church, crowned and filled with every aid and
blessing, because Thou art Lord and Father, Creator of all.

<span id="xii.iv-p27"></span>And on account, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p28"></span>At the commemoration of saints.  

<span id="xii.iv-p29"></span>Thou, O Lord, art truly the raiser up of
our bodies: Thou art the good Saviour of our souls, and the secure
preserver of our life; and we ought to thank Thee continually, to adore
and glorify Thee, O Lord of all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p30"></span>At the lessons. <span
id="fr_4224"></span>[4225](#fn_4224.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p32"></span>Holy art Thou, worthy of praise, mighty,
immortal, who dwellest in the holies, and Thy will resteth in them: have
regard unto us, O Lord; be merciful unto us, and pity us, as Thou art
our helper in all circumstances, O Lord of all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p33"></span>IV. At the apostle. <span
id="fr_4225"></span>[4226](#fn_4225.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p35"></span>Enlighten, O our Lord and God, the
movements of our meditations to hear and understand the sweet listenings
to Thy life-giving and divine <span id="page_562">p. 562</span> <span
id="xii.iv-Page_562"></span>commands; and grant unto us through Thy
grace and mercy to gather from them the assurance of love, and hope, and
salvation suitable to soul and body, and we shall sing to Thee
everlasting glory without ceasing and always, O Lord of all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p36"></span>On fast-days.  

<span id="xii.iv-p37"></span>To Thee, the wise governor, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p38"></span>V. Descending, he shall salute the Gospel,
saying this prayer before the altar.  

<span id="xii.iv-p39"></span>Thee, the renowned seed of Thy Father, and
the image of the person of Thy Father, who wast revealed in the body of
our humanity, and didst arise to us in the light of Thy annunciation,
Thee we thank, adore, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p40"></span>And after the proclamation: <span
id="fr_4226"></span>[4227](#fn_4226.md) —  

<span id="xii.iv-p42"></span>Thee, O Lord God Almighty, we beseech and
entreat, perfect with us Thy grace, and pour out through our hands Thy
gift, the pity and compassion of Thy divinity. May they be to us for the
propitiation of the offences of Thy people, and for the forgiveness of
the sins of the entire flock of Thy pasture, through Thy grace and
tender mercies, O good friend of men, O Lord of all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p43"></span>VI. The Deacons say:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p44"></span>Bow your heads.  

<span id="xii.iv-p45"></span>The Priest says this secret prayer in the
sanctuary: <span id="fr_4227"></span>[4228](#fn_4227.md) —  

<span id="xii.iv-p47"></span>O Lord God Omnipotent, Thine is the Holy
Catholic Church, inasmuch as Thou, through the great passion of Thy
Christ, didst buy the sheep of Thy pasture; and from the grace of the
Holy Spirit, who is indeed of one nature with Thy glorious divinity, are
granted the degrees of the true priestly ordination; and through Thy
clemency Thou didst vouchsafe, O Lord, to make our weakness spiritual
members in the great body of Thy Holy Church, that we might administer
spiritual aid to faithful souls. Now, O Lord, perfect Thy grace with us,
and pour out Thy gift through our hands: and may Thy tender mercies and
the clemency of Thy divinity be upon us, and upon the people whom Thou
hast chosen for Thyself.  

<span id="xii.iv-p48"></span>(Aloud.)  

<span id="xii.iv-p49"></span>And grant unto us, O Lord, through Thy
clemency, that we may all together, and equally every day of our life,
please Thy divinity, and be rendered worthy of the aid of Thy grace to
offer Thee praise, honour, thanksgiving, and adoration at all times, O
Lord.  

<span id="xii.iv-p50"></span>VII. And the Deacons ascend to the altar,
and say:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p51"></span>He who has not received baptism, etc. <span
id="fr_4228"></span>[4229](#fn_4228.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p53"></span>And the Priest begins the responsory of the
mysteries, <span id="fr_4229"></span>[4230](#fn_4229.md) and the Sacristan
and Deacon place the disk and the chalice upon the altar. The Priest
crosses his hands, and says: <span id="fr_4230"></span>[4231](#fn_4230.md)
—  

<span id="xii.iv-p56"></span>We offer praise to Thy glorious Trinity at
all times and for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p57"></span>And proceeds:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p58"></span>May Christ, who was offered for our
salvation, and commanded us to commemorate His death and His
resurrection, Himself receive this sacrifice from the hands of our
weakness, through His grace and mercies for ever. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p59"></span>And proceeds:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p60"></span>Laid are the renowned holy and life-giving
mysteries upon the altar of the mighty Lord, even until His advent, for
ever. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p61"></span>Praise, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p62"></span>Thy memory, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p63"></span>Our Father, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p64"></span>The apostles of the Father, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p65"></span>Upon the holy altar, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p66"></span>They who have slept, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p67"></span><span id="xii.iv-p67.1"></span>Matthew
<span id="xii.iv-p67.2"></span>Mark, <span
id="xii.iv-p67.3"></span>Luke, etc. <span
id="fr_4231"></span>[4232](#fn_4231.md)  

##### <span id="xii.iv-p68.6"></span>THE CREED. <span id="fr_4232"></span>[4233](#fn_4232.md)

<span id="xii.iv-p70"></span>VIII. The Priest draws near to celebrate,
and thrice bows before the altar, the middle of which he kisses, then
the right and the left horn of the altar; and bows to the Gospel side,
and says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p71"></span>Bless, O Lord, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p72"></span>Pray for me, my fathers, brethren, and
masters, that God may grant unto me the capability and power to perform
this service to which I have drawn near, and that this oblation may be
accepted from the hands of my weakness, for myself, for you, and for the
whole body of the Holy Catholic Church, through His grace and mercies
for ever. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p73"></span>And they respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p74"></span>May Christ listen to thy prayers, and be
pleased with thy sacrifice, receive thy oblation, and honour thy
priesthood, and grant unto us, through thy mediation, <span
id="fr_4233"></span>[4234](#fn_4233.md) the pardon of our offences, and the
forgiveness of our sins, through His grace and mercies for ever. <span
id="page_563">p. 563</span> <span id="xii.iv-Page_563"></span>  

<span id="xii.iv-p76"></span>Presently he bows at the other side,
uttering the same words; and they respond in the same manner: then he
bows to the altar, and says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p77"></span>God, Lord of all, be with us through His
grace and mercies for ever. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p78"></span>And bowing towards the Deacon, who is on
the left (Epistle side), he says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p79"></span>God, the Lord of all, confirm thy words,
and secure to thee peace, and accept this oblation from my hands for me,
for thee, for the whole body of the Holy Catholic Church, and for the
entire world, through His grace and mercies for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p80"></span>He kneels at the altar, and says in
secret:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p81"></span>IX. O our Lord and God, look not on the
multitude of our sins, and let not Thy dignity be turned away on account
of the heinousness of our iniquities; but through Thine unspeakable
grace sanctify this sacrifice of Thine, and grant through it power and
capability, so that Thou mayest forget our many sins, and be merciful
when Thou shalt appear at the end of time, in the man whom Thou hast
assumed from among us, and we may find before Thee grace and mercy, and
be rendered worthy to praise Thee with spiritual <span
id="fr_4234"></span>[4235](#fn_4234.md) assemblies.  

<span id="xii.iv-p83"></span>He rises, and says this prayer in secret:—
 

<span id="xii.iv-p84"></span>We thank Thee, O our Lord and God, for the
abundant riches of Thy grace to us:  

<span id="xii.iv-p85"></span>And he proceeds:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p86"></span>Us who were sinful and degraded, on account
of the multitude of Thy clemency, Thou hast made worthy to celebrate the
holy mysteries of the body and blood of Thy Christ. We beg aid from Thee
for the strengthening of our souls, that in perfect love and true faith
we may administer Thy gift to us.  

<span id="xii.iv-p87"></span>Canon.  

<span id="xii.iv-p88"></span> And we shall ascribe to Thee praise,
glory, thanksgiving, and adoration, now, always, and for ever and ever.
 

<span id="xii.iv-p89"></span>He signs himself with the sign of the
cross, and they respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p90"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p91"></span>X. And he proceeds:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p92"></span>Peace be with you:  

<span id="xii.iv-p93"></span>They respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p94"></span>With thee and with thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iv-p95"></span>And they give the (kiss of) peace to each
other, and say:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p96"></span>For all: <span
id="fr_4235"></span>[4236](#fn_4235.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p98"></span>The Deacon says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p99"></span>Let us thank, entreat, and beseech.  

<span id="xii.iv-p100"></span>The Priest says this prayer in secret:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p101"></span>O Lord, mighty God, help my weakness
through Thy clemency and the aid of Thy grace; and make me worthy of
offering before Thee this oblation, as for the common aid of all, and to
the praise of Thy Trinity, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  

<span id="xii.iv-p102"></span>Another prayer. <span
id="fr_4236"></span>[4237](#fn_4236.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p104"></span>O our Lord and God, restrain our thoughts,
that they wander not amid the vanities of this world. O Lord our God,
grant that I may be united to the affection of Thy love, unworthy though
I be. Glory be to Thee, O Christ.  

<span id="xii.iv-p105"></span>Ascend into the chamber of Thy renowned
light, O Lord; sow in me the good seed of humility; and under the wings
of Thy grace hide me through Thy mercy. If Thou wert to mark iniquities,
O Lord, who shall stand? Because there is mercy with Thee.  

<span id="xii.iv-p106"></span>\[The Priest says the following prayer in
secret: <span id="fr_4237"></span>[4238](#fn_4237.md) —  

<span id="xii.iv-p108"></span>O mother of our Lord <span
id="xii.iv-p108.1"></span>Jesus Christ, beseech for me the only-begotten
Son, who was born of thee, to forgive me my offences and my sins, and to
accept from my feeble and sinful hands this sacrifice which my weakness
offers upon this altar, through thy intercession for me, O holy
mother.\]  

<span id="xii.iv-p109"></span>XI. When the Deacon shall say, <span
id="xii.iv-p109.1"></span>With watchfulness and care, etc., immediately
the Priest rises up and uncovers the sacraments, taking away the veil
with which they were covered: he blesses the incense, and says a canon
with a loud voice:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p110"></span>The grace of our Lord <span
id="xii.iv-p110.1"></span>Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father,
and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with us all, now, etc. <span
id="fr_4238"></span>[4239](#fn_4238.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p112"></span>He signs the sacraments, and they
respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p113"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p114"></span>The Priest proceeds:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p115"></span>Lift up your minds:  

<span id="xii.iv-p116"></span>They respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p117"></span>They are towards Thee, O God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Israel, O glorious King. <span id="page_564">p. 564</span>
<span id="xii.iv-Page_564"></span>  

<span id="xii.iv-p118"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iv-p119"></span>The oblation is offered to God, the Lord
of all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p120"></span>They respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p121"></span>It is meet and right.  

<span id="xii.iv-p122"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iv-p123"></span>Peace be with you.  

<span id="xii.iv-p124"></span>The Priest puts on the incense, and says
this prayer:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p125"></span>O Lord, Lord, grant me an open countenance
before Thee, that with the confidence which is from Thee we may fulfil
this awful and divine sacrifice with consciences free from all iniquity
and bitterness. Sow in us, O Lord, affection, peace, and concord towards
each other, and toward every one.  

<span id="xii.iv-p126"></span>And standing, he says in secret: <span
id="fr_4239"></span>[4240](#fn_4239.md) —  

<span id="xii.iv-p128"></span>Worthy of glory from every mouth, and of
thanksgiving from all tongues, and of adoration and exaltation from all
creatures, is the adorable and glorious name of Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, who created the world through His grace, and its inhabitants
through His clemency, who saved men through His mercy, and showed great
favour towards mortals. Thy majesty, O Lord, thousands of thousands of
heavenly <span id="xii.iv-p128.1"></span>spirits, and ten thousand
myriads of holy angels, hosts of spirits, ministers of fire and spirit,
bless and adore; with the holy cherubim and the spiritual seraphim they
sanctify and celebrate Thy name, crying and praising, without ceasing
crying unto each other.  

<span id="xii.iv-p129"></span>They say with a loud voice:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p130"></span>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty; full
are the heavens and the earth of His glory.  

<span id="xii.iv-p131"></span>The Priest in secret:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p132"></span>Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O Lord God
Almighty; the heavens and the earth are full of His glory and the nature
of His essence, as they are glorious with the honour of His splendour;
<span id="xii.iv-p132.1"></span>as it is written, The heaven and the
earth are full of me, saith the mighty Lord.  

<span id="xii.iv-p133"></span>Holy art Thou, O God <span
id="xii.iv-p133.1"></span>our Father, truly the only one, of whom the
whole family in heaven and earth is named. Holy art Thou, Eternal Son,
through whom all things were made. Holy art Thou, Holy, Eternal Spirit,
through whom all things are sanctified.  

<span id="xii.iv-p134"></span>Woe to me, woe to me, who have been
astonied, because I am a man of polluted lips, and dwell among a people
of polluted lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the mighty Lord. How
terrible to-day is this place! For this is none other than the house of
God and the gate of heaven; because Thou hast been seen eye to eye, O
Lord.  

<span id="xii.iv-p135"></span>Now, I pray, may Thy grace be with us, O
Lord; purge away our impurities, and sanctify our lips; unite the voices
of our insignificance with the sanctification of seraphim and
archangels. Glory be to Thy tender mercies, because Thou hast associated
the earthly with the heavenly. <span
id="fr_4240"></span>[4241](#fn_4240.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p137"></span>And he proceeds, saying in secret this
prayer, in a bowing posture:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p138"></span>XII. And with those heavenly powers we
give Thee thanks, even we, Thine insignificant, pithless, and feeble
servants; because Thou hast granted unto us Thy great grace which cannot
be repaid. For indeed Thou didst take upon Thee our human nature, that
Thou mightest bestow life on us through Thy divinity; Thou didst exalt
our low condition; Thou didst raise our ruined state; Thou didst rouse
up our mortality; Thou didst wash away our sins; Thou didst blot out the
guilt of our sins; Thou didst enlighten our intelligence, and Thou didst
condemn our enemy, O Lord our God; and Thou didst cause the
insignificance of our pithless nature to triumph.  

<span id="xii.iv-p139"></span>Here follow the words of
institution, <span id="fr_4241"></span>[4242](#fn_4241.md) after which:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p141"></span>Through the tender mercies of Thy grace
poured out, O clement One, pardon our offences and sins; blot out my
offences in the judgment. And on account of all Thy aids and Thy favours
to us, we shall ascribe unto Thee praise, <span
id="fr_4242"></span>[4243](#fn_4242.md) honour, thanksgiving, and
adoration, now, always, and for ever and ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p143"></span>The Priest signs the sacraments. The
response is made.  

<span id="xii.iv-p144"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p145"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iv-p146"></span>In your minds. Pray for peace with us.  

<span id="xii.iv-p147"></span>The Priest says this prayer <span
id="fr_4243"></span>[4244](#fn_4243.md) bowing, and in a low voice:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p150"></span>O Lord God Almighty, accept this oblation
for the whole Holy Catholic Church, and for all <span id="page_565">p.
565</span> <span id="xii.iv-Page_565"></span>the pious and righteous
fathers who have been pleasing to Thee, and for all the prophets and
apostles, and for all the martyrs and confessors, and for all that
mourn, that are in straits, and are sick, and for all that are under
difficulties and trials, and for all the weak and the oppressed, and for
all the dead that have gone from amongst us; then for all that ask a
prayer from our weakness, and for me, a degraded and feeble sinner. O
Lord our God, according to Thy mercies and the multitude of Thy favours,
look upon Thy people, and on me, a feeble man, not according to my sins
and my follies, but that they may become worthy of the forgiveness of
their sins through this holy body, which they receive with faith,
through the grace of Thy mercy for ever and ever. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p151"></span>The Priest says this prayer of inclination
in secret:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p152"></span>XIII. Do Thou, O Lord, through Thy many
and ineffable mercies, make the memorial good and acceptable <span
id="xii.iv-p152.1"></span>with that of <span
id="fr_4244"></span>[4245](#fn_4244.md) all the pious and righteous fathers
who have been pleading before Thee in the commemoration of the body and
blood of Thy Christ, which we offer to Thee upon Thy pure and holy
altar, as Thou hast taught us; and grant unto us Thy rest all the days
of this life.  

<span id="xii.iv-p154"></span>He proceeds with the Great Oblation:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p155"></span>O Lord our God, bestow on us Thy rest and
peace all the days of this life, that all the inhabitants of the earth
may know Thee, that Thou art the only true God the Father, and Thou
didst send our Lord <span id="xii.iv-p155.1"></span>Jesus Christ, Thy
Son and Thy beloved; and He Himself our Lord and God came and taught us
all purity and holiness. Make remembrance of prophets, apostles,
martyrs, confessors, bishops, doctors, priests, deacons, and all the
sons of the Holy Catholic Church who have been signed with the sign of
life, of holy baptism. We also, O Lord:  

<span id="xii.iv-p156"></span>He proceeds:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p157"></span>We, Thy degraded, weak, and feeble
servants who are congregated in Thy name, and now stand before Thee, and
have received with joy the form which is from Thee, praising,
glorifying, and exalting, commemorate and celebrate this great, awful,
holy, and divine mystery of the passion, death, burial, and resurrection
of our Lord and Saviour <span id="xii.iv-p157.1"></span>Jesus Christ.  

<span id="xii.iv-p158"></span>And may Thy Holy Spirit come, O
Lord, <span id="fr_4245"></span>[4246](#fn_4245.md) and rest upon this
oblation of Thy servants which they offer, and bless and sanctify it;
and may it be unto us, O Lord, for the propitiation of our offences and
the forgiveness of our sins, and for a grand hope of resurrection from
the dead, and for a new life in the kingdom of the heavens, with all who
have been pleasing before Him. And on account of the whole of Thy
wonderful dispensation towards us, we shall render thanks unto Thee, and
glorify Thee without ceasing in Thy Church, redeemed by the precious
blood of Thy Christ, with open mouths and joyful countenances:  

<span id="xii.iv-p160"></span>Canon.  

<span id="xii.iv-p161"></span>Ascribing praise, <span
id="fr_4246"></span>[4247](#fn_4246.md) honour, thanksgiving, and adoration
to Thy holy, loving, and life-giving name, now, always, and for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p163"></span>The Priest signs the mysteries with the
cross, and they respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p164"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p165"></span>The Priest bows himself and kisses the
altar, first in the middle, then at the two sides right and left, and
says this prayer: <span id="fr_4247"></span>[4248](#fn_4247.md) —  

<span id="xii.iv-p167"></span>Have mercy upon me, O God, <span
id="xii.iv-p167.1"></span>down to the words, and sinners shall be
converted unto Thee: <span id="xii.iv-p167.2"></span>and unto Thee lift
I up mine eyes, <span id="fr_4248"></span>[4249](#fn_4248.md) <span
id="xii.iv-p168.3"></span>down to have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy
upon us. <span id="xii.iv-p168.4"></span>Also stretch forth Thy hand,
and let Thy right hand save me, O Lord; may Thy mercies remain upon me,
O Lord, for ever, and despise not the works of Thy hands. <span
id="fr_4249"></span>[4250](#fn_4249.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p170"></span>Then he says this prayer:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p171"></span>XIV. O Christ, peace of those in heaven
and great rest of those below, <span
id="fr_4250"></span>[4251](#fn_4250.md) grant that Thy rest and peace may
dwell in the four parts of the world, <span
id="fr_4251"></span>[4252](#fn_4251.md) but especially in Thy Holy Catholic
Church; grant that the priesthood with the government may have peace;
cause wars to cease from the ends of the earth, and scatter the nations
that delight in wars, <span id="fr_4252"></span>[4253](#fn_4252.md) that we
may enjoy the blessing of living in tranquillity and peace, in all
temperance and fear of God. Spare the offences and sins of the dead,
through Thy grace and mercies for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p175"></span>And to those who are around the altar he
says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p176"></span>Bless, O Lord. Bless, O Lord.  

<span id="xii.iv-p177"></span>And he puts on the incense with which he
fumes himself, and says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p178"></span>Sweeten, O Lord our God, the unpleasing
savour <span id="fr_4253"></span>[4254](#fn_4253.md) of our souls through
the sweetness of Thy <span id="page_566">p. 566</span> <span
id="xii.iv-Page_566"></span>love, and through it cleanse me from the
stains of my sin, and forgive me my offences and sins, whether known or
unknown to me.  

<span id="xii.iv-p180"></span>A second time he takes the incense with
both hands, and censes the mysteries; presently he says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p181"></span>The clemency of Thy grace, O our Lord and
God, gives us access to these renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine
mysteries, unworthy though we be.  

<span id="xii.iv-p182"></span>The Priest repeats these words once and
again, and at each interval unites his hands over his breast in the form
of a cross. He kisses the altar in the middle, and receives with both
hands the upper oblation; and looking up, says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p183"></span>Praise be to Thy holy name, O Lord <span
id="xii.iv-p183.1"></span>Jesus Christ, and adoration to Thy majesty,
always and for ever. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p184"></span>For He is the living and life-giving bread
which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the whole world, of
which they who eat die not; and they who receive it are saved by it, and
do not see corruption, and live through it for ever; and Thou art the
antidote of our mortality, <span id="fr_4254"></span>[4255](#fn_4254.md)
and the resurrection of our entire frame. <span
id="fr_4255"></span>[4256](#fn_4255.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p187"></span>XV. <span
id="fr_4256"></span>[4257](#fn_4256.md) \* \* \*  

<span id="xii.iv-p189"></span>XVI. Praise to Thy holy name, O Lord.
(<span id="xii.iv-p189.1"></span>As above.)  

<span id="xii.iv-p190"></span>The Priest kisses the host <span
id="fr_4257"></span>[4258](#fn_4257.md) in the form of a cross; in such a
way, however, that his lips do not touch it, but appear to kiss it; and
he says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p192"></span>Glory to Thee, O Lord; glory to Thee, O
Lord, on account of Thine unspeakable gift to us, for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p193"></span>Then he draws nigh to the fraction of the
host, <span id="fr_4258"></span>[4259](#fn_4258.md) which he accomplishes
with both his hands, saying:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p195"></span>We draw nigh, O Lord, with true faith, and
break with thanksgiving and sign through Thy mercy the body and blood of
our Life-giver, <span id="xii.iv-p195.1"></span>Jesus Christ, in the
name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  

<span id="xii.iv-p196"></span>And, naming the Trinity, he breaks the
host, <span id="fr_4259"></span>[4260](#fn_4259.md) which he holds in his
hands, into two parts: and the one which is in his left hand he lays
down on the disk; with the other, which he holds in his right hand, he
signs the chalice, saying:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p198"></span>The precious blood is signed with the holy
body of our Lord <span id="xii.iv-p198.1"></span>Jesus Christ. In the
name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p199"></span>And they respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p200"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p201"></span>Then he dips it even to the middle in the
chalice, and signs with it the body which is in the paten, saying:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p202"></span>The holy body is signed with the
propitiatory blood of our Lord <span id="xii.iv-p202.1"></span>Jesus
Christ. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p203"></span>And they respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p204"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p205"></span>And he unites the two parts, the one with
the other, saying:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p206"></span>Divided, sanctified, completed, perfected,
united, and commingled have been these renowned, holy, life-giving, and
divine mysteries, the one with the other, in the adorable and glorious
name of Thy glorious Trinity, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that they
may be to us, O Lord, for the propitiation of our offences and the
forgiveness of our sins; also for the grand hope of a resurrection from
the dead, and of a new life in the kingdom of the heavens, for us and
for the Holy Church of Christ our Lord, here and in every place
whatsoever, now and always, and for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p207"></span>XVII. <span id="xii.iv-p207.1"></span>In
the meantime he signs the host <span
id="fr_4260"></span>[4261](#fn_4260.md) <span id="xii.iv-p208.3"></span>
with his right thumb in the form of a cross from the lower part to the
upper, and from the right to the left, and thus forms a slight fissure
in it where it has been dipped in the blood. He puts a part of it into
the chalice in the form of a cross: the lower part is placed towards the
priest, the upper towards the chalice, so that the place of the fissure
looks to the chalice. He bows, and rising, says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p209"></span>Glory be to Thee, O Lord <span
id="xii.iv-p209.1"></span>Jesus Christ, who hast made me, unworthy
though I be, through Thy grace, a minister and mediator of Thy renowed,
holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries: through the grace of Thy mercy,
make me worthy of the pardon of my offences and the forgiveness of my
sins. <span id="page_567">p. 567</span> <span
id="xii.iv-Page_567"></span>  

<span id="xii.iv-p210"></span>He signs himself with the sign of the
cross an his forehead, and does the same to those standing round
him. <span id="fr_4261"></span>[4262](#fn_4261.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p214"></span>The Deacons approach, and he signs each
one of them on the forehead, saying:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p215"></span>Christ accept thy ministry: Christ cause
thy face to shine: Christ save thy life: Christ make thy youth to grow.
 

<span id="xii.iv-p216"></span>And they respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p217"></span>Christ accept thy oblation.  

<span id="xii.iv-p218"></span>XVIII. All return to their own place; and
the Priest, after bowing, rises and says, in the tone of the Gospel:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p219"></span>The grace of our Lord <span
id="xii.iv-p219.1"></span>Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father,
and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with us all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p220"></span>The Priest signs himself, and lifts up his
hand over his head, so that it should be in the air, and the people be
partakers in the singing:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p221"></span>The Deacon says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p222"></span>We all with fear, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p223"></span>And at these words:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p224"></span>He hath given to us His mysteries:  

<span id="xii.iv-p225"></span>The Priest begins to break <span
id="fr_4262"></span>[4263](#fn_4262.md) the body, and says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p227"></span>Be merciful, O Lord, through Thy clemency
to the sins and follies of Thy servants, and sanctify our lips through
Thy grace, that they may give the fruits of glory and praise to Thy
divinity, with all Thy saints in Thy kingdom.  

<span id="xii.iv-p228"></span>And, raising his voice, he says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p229"></span>And make us worthy, O Lord our God, to
stand before Thee continually without stain, with pure heart, with open
countenance, and with the confidence which is from Thee, mercifully
granted to us: and let us all with one accord invoke Thee, and say thus:
Our Father, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p230"></span>The People say:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p231"></span>Our Father, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p232"></span>The Priest. <span
id="fr_4263"></span>[4264](#fn_4263.md)  

<span id="xii.iv-p234"></span>O Lord God Almighty, O Lord and our good
God, who art full of mercy, we beg Thee, O Lord our God, and beseech the
clemency of Thy goodness; lead us not into temptation, but deliver and
save us from the evil one and his hosts; because Thine is the kingdom,
the power, the strength, the might, and the dominion in heaven and on
earth, now and always.  

<span id="xii.iv-p235"></span>He signs himself, and they respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p236"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p237"></span>XIX. And he proceeds:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p238"></span>Peace be with you.  

<span id="xii.iv-p239"></span>They respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p240"></span>With thee and with thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iv-p241"></span>He proceeds:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p242"></span>It is becoming that the holy things should
be to the holy in perfection.  

<span id="xii.iv-p243"></span>And they say:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p244"></span>One holy Father: one holy Son: one Holy
Ghost. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,
for ever and ever. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p245"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iv-p246"></span>Praise ye.  

<span id="xii.iv-p247"></span>And they say the responsory. And when the
Deacon comes to carry the chalice, he says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p248"></span>Let us pray for peace with us.  

<span id="xii.iv-p249"></span>The Priest says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p250"></span>The grace of the Holy Ghost be with thee,
with us, and with those who receive Him. And he gives the chalice to the
Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iv-p251"></span>The Deacon says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p252"></span>Bless, O Lord.  

<span id="xii.iv-p253"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iv-p254"></span>The gift of the grace of our Life-giver
and Lord <span id="xii.iv-p254.1"></span>Jesus Christ be completed, in
mercies, with all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p255"></span>And he signs the people with the cross. In
the meantime the responsories are said.  

<span id="xii.iv-p256"></span> Brethren, receive the body of the Son,
cries the Church, and drink ye His chalice with faith in the house of
His kingdom.  

<span id="xii.iv-p257"></span>On feast-days.  

<span id="xii.iv-p258"></span>Strengthen, O Lord, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p259"></span>On the Lord’s day.  

<span id="xii.iv-p260"></span>O Lord <span
id="xii.iv-p260.1"></span>Jesus Christ, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p261"></span>Daily.  

<span id="xii.iv-p262"></span>The mysteries which we have received, etc.
 

<span id="xii.iv-p263"></span>The responsories being ended, the Deacon
says:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p264"></span>All therefore, etc.  

<span id="xii.iv-p265"></span><span id="page_568">p. 568</span> <span
id="xii.iv-Page_568"></span>  

<span id="xii.iv-p266"></span>And they respond:—  

<span id="xii.iv-p267"></span>Glory be to Himself on account of His
ineffable gift.  

<span id="xii.iv-p268"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iv-p269"></span>Let us pray for peace with us.  

<span id="xii.iv-p270"></span>The Priest at the middle of the altar says
this prayer: <span id="fr_4264"></span>[4265](#fn_4264.md) —  

<span id="xii.iv-p272"></span>XX. It is meet, O Lord, just and right in
all days, times, and hours, to thank, adore, and praise the awful name
of Thy majesty, because Thou hast through Thy grace, O Lord, made us,
mortal men possessing a frail nature, worthy to sanctify Thy name with
the heavenly <span id="fr_4265"></span>[4266](#fn_4265.md) beings, and to
become partakers of the mysteries of Thy gift, and to be delighted with
the sweetness of Thy oracles. And voices of glory and thanksgiving we
ever offer up to Thy sublime divinity, O Lord.  

<span id="xii.iv-p274"></span>Another.  

<span id="xii.iv-p275"></span>Christ, our God, Lord, King, Saviour, and
Life-giver, through His grace has made us worthy to receive His body and
His precious and all-sanctifying blood. May He grant unto us that we may
be pleasing unto Him in our words, works, thoughts, and deeds, so that
that pledge which we have received may be to us for the pardon of our
offences, the forgiveness of our sins, and the grand hope of a
resurrection from the dead, and a new and true life in the kingdom of
the heavens, with all who have been pleasing before Him, through His
grace and His mercies for ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p276"></span>On ordinary days.  

<span id="xii.iv-p277"></span>Praise, O Lord, honour, blessing, and
thanksgiving we ought to ascribe to Thy glorious Trinity for the gift of
Thy holy mysteries, which Thou hast given to us for the propitiation of
our offences, O Lord of all.  

<span id="xii.iv-p278"></span>Another.  

<span id="xii.iv-p279"></span>Blessed be Thy adorable honour, from Thy
glorious place, O Christ, the propitiator of our offences and our sins,
and who takest away our follies through Thy renowned, holy, life-giving,
and divine mysteries. Christ the hope of our nature always and for ever.
Amen.  

<span id="xii.iv-p280"></span>Obsignation or final benediction.  

<span id="xii.iv-p281"></span>May our Lord <span
id="xii.iv-p281.1"></span>Jesus Christ, to whom we have ministered, and
whom we have seen and honoured in His renowned, holy, life-giving, and
divine mysteries, Himself render us worthy of the splendid glory of His
kingdom, and of gladness with His holy angels, and for confidence before
Him, that we may stand at His right hand.  

<span id="xii.iv-p282"></span>And on our entire congregation may His
mercies and compassion be continually poured out, now and always, and
ever.  

<span id="xii.iv-p283"></span>On the Lord’s day and on feast-days.  

<span id="xii.iv-p284"></span>May He Himself who blessed us with all
spiritual blessings in the heavens, through <span
id="xii.iv-p284.1"></span>Jesus Christ our Lord, and prepared us for His
kingdom, and called us to the desirable good things which neither cease
nor perish, as He promised to us in His life-giving Gospel, and said to
the blessed congregation of His disciples—Verily, verily I say unto you,
that every one who eateth my body and drinketh my blood, abideth in me,
and I in him, and I will raise him up at the last day; and he cometh not
to judgment, but I will make him pass from death to eternal life:  

<span id="xii.iv-p285"></span>May He Himself now bless this
congregation, and maintain our position, and render glorious our people
who have come and rejoiced in receiving His renowned, holy, life-giving,
and divine mysteries; and may ye be sealed and guarded by the holy sign
of the Lord’s cross from all evils, secret and open, now and always.

<span id="xii.iv-p149"></span>O Lord God Almighty, hear the voice of my
cry before Thee at this time. Give ear, O Lord, and hear my groanings
before Thy majesty, and accept the entreaty of me, a sinner, with which
I call upon Thy grace, at this hour at which the sacrifice is offered to
Thy Father. Have mercy on all creatures; spare the guilty; convert the
erring; restore the oppressed; on the disquieted bestow rest; heal the
weak; console the afflicted; and perfect the alms of those who work
righteousness on account of Thy holy name. Have mercy on me also, a
sinner, through Thy grace. O Lord God Almighty, may this oblation be
accepted for the entire Holy Catholic Church; and for priests, kings,
princes, <span id="xii.iv-p149.1"></span>and the rest as above.

<span id="xii.iv-p188"></span> In the <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iv-p188.1"></span>ms</span>. of Elias, which we have followed,
there is a defect, seeing that the whole recitation of the words of
Christ is omitted through the fault of the transcriber, or because these
ought to have been taken from another source, namely, from the Liturgy
of <span id="xii.iv-p188.2"></span>Theodorus or <span
id="xii.iv-p188.3"></span>Nestorius. In that which the Patriarch <span
id="xii.iv-p188.4"></span>Joseph wrote at Rome, 1697, that entire
passage is remodelled according to the Chaldean missal published at
Rome, as in the mass, a translation of which was edited by <span
id="xii.iv-p188.5"></span>Alexius Menesius. Since there were no other
codices at hand, in this place it seemed good to place asterisks to
indicate the defects.
