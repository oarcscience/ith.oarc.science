#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chap. IV.—The Testimonies of the Philosophers to the Unity of God.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.v-p1"></span>But let us come to the philosophers,
whose authority is regarded as more certain than that of the poets.
<span id="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Plato asserts His monarchy, saying
that there is but one God, by whom the world was prepared and completed
with wonderful order. <span id="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.2"></span>Aristotle,
his disciple, admits that there is one mind which presides over the
world. <span id="iii.ii.viii.v-p1.3"></span>Antisthenes says that there
is one who is God by nature, <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md)
the governor of the whole system. It would be a long task to recount the
statements which have been made respecting the Supreme God, either by
<span id="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.2"></span>Thales, or by <span
id="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.3"></span>Pythagoras and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.4"></span>Anaximenes before him, or afterwards by
the Stoics <span id="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.5"></span>Cleanthes and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.6"></span>Chrysippus and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.7"></span>Zeno, or of our countrymen, by <span
id="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.8"></span>Seneca following the Stoics, and by <span
id="iii.ii.viii.v-p2.9"></span>Tullius himself, since all these
attempted to define the being of God, <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) and affirmed that the world is
ruled by Him alone, and that He is not subject to any nature, since all
nature derives its origin from Him.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.v-p4"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.v-p4.1"></span>Hermes, who, on account of his virtue and
his knowledge of many arts, deserved the name of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.v-p4.2"></span>Trismegistus, who preceded the
philosophers in the antiquity of his doctrine, and who is reverenced by
the Egyptians as a god, in asserting the majesty of the one God with
infinite praises, calls Him Lord and Father, and says that He is without
a name because He does not stand in need of a proper name, inasmuch as
He is alone, and that He has no parents, since He exists of Himself and
by Himself. In writing to his son he thus begins: To understand God is
difficult, to describe Him in speech is impossible, even for one to whom
it is possible to understand Him; for the perfect cannot be comprehended
by the imperfect, nor the invisible by the visible.
