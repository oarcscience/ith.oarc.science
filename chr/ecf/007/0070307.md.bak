#### <span id="iii.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chap. XX.—Of Himself and the Truth.

<span id="iii.iv.xx-p1"></span>These things I have written to you, <span
id="iii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Demetrianus, for the present in few words,
and perhaps with more obscurity than was befitting, in accordance with
the necessity of circumstances and the time, with which you ought to be
content, since you are about to receive more and better things if God
shall favour us. Then, accordingly, I will exhort you with greater
clearness and truth to the learning of true philosophy. For I have
determined to commit to writing as many things as I shall be able, which
have reference to the condition of a happy life; and that indeed against
the philosophers, since they are pernicious and weighty for the
disturbing of the truth. For the force of their eloquence is incredible,
and their subtlety in argument and disputation may easily deceive any
one; and these we will refute partly by our own weapons, but partly by
weapons borrowed from their mutual wrangling, so that it may be evident
that they rather introduced error than removed it.  

<span id="iii.iv.xx-p2"></span>Perhaps you may wonder that I venture to
undertake so great a deed. Shall we then suffer the truth to be
extinguished or crushed? I, in truth, would more willingly fail even
under this burthen. For if <span id="iii.iv.xx-p2.1"></span>Marcus
Tullius, the unparalleled example of eloquence itself, was often
vanquished by men void of learning and eloquence,—who, however, were
striving for that which was true,—why should we despair that the truth
itself will by its own peculiar force and clearness avail against
deceitful and captious eloquence? They indeed are wont to profess
themselves advocates of the truth; but who can defend that which he has
not learned, or make clear to others that which he himself does not
know? I seem to promise a great thing; but there is need of the favour
of Heaven, that ability and time may be given us for following our
purpose. But if life is to be wished for by a wise man, assuredly I
should wish to live for no other reason than that I may effect something
which may be worthy of life, and which may be useful to my readers, if
<span id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xx-Page_300"></span>not for eloquence, because there is in me
but a slight stream of eloquence, at any rate for living, which is
especially needful. And when I have accomplished this, I shall think
that I have lived enough, and that I have discharged the duty of a man,
if my labour shall have freed some men from errors, and have directed
them to the path which leads to heaven.
