#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chap. V.—That the Prophetic Women—That Is, the Sibyls—Declare that There is But One God.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.vi-p1"></span>It remains to speak of the prophetic
women. <span id="iii.ii.viii.vi-p1.1"></span>Varro relates that there
were ten <span id="iii.ii.viii.vi-p1.2"></span>Sibyls,—the first of the
Persians, the second the Libyan, the third the Delphian, the fourth the
Cimmerian, the fifth the Erythræan, the sixth the Samian, the seventh
the Cumæan, the eighth the Hellespontian, the ninth the Phrygian, the
tenth the Tiburtine, who has the name of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.vi-p1.3"></span>Albunea. Of all these, he says that
there are three books of the Cumæan alone which contain the fates of the
Romans, and are accounted sacred, but that there exist, and are commonly
regarded as separate, books of almost all the others, but that they are
entitled, as though by one name, Sibylline books, <span id="page_226">p.
226</span> <span id="iii.ii.viii.vi-Page_226"></span>excepting that the
Erythræan, who is said to have lived in the times of the Trojan war,
placed her name in her book: the writings of the others are mixed
together. <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.vi-p3"></span>All these Sibyls of whom I have
spoken, except the Cumæan, whom none but the Quindecemviri <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md) are allowed to read, bear witness
that there is but one God, the ruler, the maker, the parent, not
begotten of any, but sprung from Himself, who was from all ages, and
will be to all ages; and therefore is alone worthy of being worshipped,
alone of being feared, alone of being reverenced, by all living
beings;—whose testimonies I have omitted because I was unable to abridge
them; but if you wish to see them, you must have recourse to the books
themselves. Now let us follow up the remaining subjects.
