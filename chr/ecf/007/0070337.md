#### <span id="iii.v.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXVIII.

<span id="iii.v.xxviii-p1"></span>After the flight of <span
id="iii.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Galerius, <span
id="iii.v.xxviii-p1.2"></span>Maximian, having returned from Gaul, held
authority in common with his son; but more obedience was yielded to the
young man than to the old: for <span
id="iii.v.xxviii-p1.3"></span>Maxentius had most power, and had been
longest in possession of it; and it was to him that <span
id="iii.v.xxviii-p1.4"></span>Maximian owed on this occasion the
imperial dignity. The old man was impatient at being denied the exercise
of uncontrolled sovereignty, and envied his son with a childish spirit
of rivalry; and therefore he began to consider how he might expel <span
id="iii.v.xxviii-p1.5"></span>Maxentius and resume his ancient dominion.
This appeared easy, because the soldiers who deserted <span
id="iii.v.xxviii-p1.6"></span>Severus had originally served in his own
army. He called an assembly of the people of Rome, and of the soldiers,
as if he had been to make an harangue on the calamitous situation of
public affairs. After having spoken much on that subject, he stretched
his hands towards his son, charged him as author of all ills and prime
cause of the calamities of the state, and then tore the purple from his
shoulders. <span id="iii.v.xxviii-p1.7"></span>Maxentius, thus stripped,
leaped headlong from the tribunal, and was received into the arms of the
soldiers. Their rage and clamour confounded the unnatural old man, and,
like another <span id="iii.v.xxviii-p1.8"></span>Tarquin the Proud, he
was driven from Rome.
