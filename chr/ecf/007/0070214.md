#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXVI.—Of the Worship of the Elements and Stars.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxii-p1"></span>Now let us refute those also who
regard the elements of the world as gods, that is, the heaven, the sun,
and the moon; for being ignorant of the Maker of these things, they
admire and adore the works themselves. And this error belongs not to the
ignorant only, but also to philosophers; since the Stoics are of opinion
that all the heavenly bodies are to be considered as among the number of
the gods, since they all have fixed and regular motions, by which they
most constantly preserve the vicissitudes of the times which succeed
them. They do not then possess voluntary motion, since they obey
prescribed laws, and plainly not by their own sense, but by the
workmanship of the supreme Creator, who so ordered them that they should
complete unerring <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477) courses and
fixed circuits, by which they might vary the alternations of days and
nights, of summer and winter. But if men admire the effects of these, if
they admire their courses, their brightness, their regularity, their
beauty, they ought to have understood how much more beautiful, more
illustrious, and more powerful than these is the maker and contriver
Himself, even God. But they estimated the Divinity by objects which fall
under the sight of men; <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478) not
knowing that objects which come within the sight cannot be eternal, and
that those which are eternal cannot be discerned by mortal eyes.
