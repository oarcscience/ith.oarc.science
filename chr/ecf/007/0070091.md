#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chap. IX.—Of the Word of God.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p1"></span>But the Greeks speak of Him as the
<span class="Foreign"><span
id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Logos</span>, <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) more befittingly than we do as the
word, or speech: for <span class="Foreign"><span
id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p2.4"></span>Logos</span> signifies both speech and
reason, inasmuch as He is both the voice and the wisdom of God. And of
this divine speech not even the philosophers were ignorant, since <span
id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p2.5"></span>Zeno represents the <span
class="Foreign"><span id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p2.6"></span>Logos</span> as the
arranger of the established order of things, and the framer of the
universe: whom also He calls Fate, and the necessity of things, and God,
and the soul of <span id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p2.7"></span>Jupiter, in
accordance with the custom, indeed, by which they are wont to regard
<span id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p2.8"></span>Jupiter as God. But the words are no
obstacle, since the sentiment is in agreement with the truth. For it is
the spirit of God which he named the soul of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p2.9"></span>Jupiter. For <span
id="iii.ii.iv.ix-p2.10"></span>Trismegistus, who by some means or other
searched into almost all truth, often described the excellence and
majesty of the word, as the instance before mentioned declares, in which
he acknowledges that there is an ineffable and sacred speech, the
relation of which exceeds the measure of man’s ability. I have spoken
briefly, as I have been able, concerning the first nativity. Now I must
more fully discuss the second, since this is the subject most
controverted, that we may hold forth the light of understanding to those
who desire to know the truth.
