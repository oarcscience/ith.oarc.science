#### <span id="viii.iii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV. <span id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) —Bishops and Deacons; Christian Reproof.

<span id="viii.iii.xv-p2"></span>1. Appoint, therefore, for yourselves,
bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord, men meek, and not lovers of
money, <span id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md) and truthful and
proved; for they also render to you the service <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) of prophets and teachers. 2.
Despise them not therefore, for they are your honoured ones, together
with the prophets and teachers. 3. And reprove one another, not in
anger, but in peace, as ye have <span id="viii.iii.xv-p4.1"></span>it in
the Gospel; <span id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499.md) but to every one
that acts amiss <span id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md) against
another, let no one speak, nor let him hear aught from you until he
repent. 4. But your prayers and alms and all your deeds so do, as ye
have <span id="viii.iii.xv-p6.4"></span>it in the Gospel of our
Lord. <span id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2496"></span>[381:2497](0070423.htm#fr_2496.md) <span
id="viii.iii.xv-p0.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xv-p1"></span> The larger part of verse 1, and a
clause from verses 2, 3, respectively, are found in <span
id="viii.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 31. Verses 1,
2, both in the use of terms and in the Church polity indicated, point to
an early date: (1) There are evident marks of a transition from
extraordinary to ordinary ministers. (2) The distinction between bishops
and elders does not appear \[[1 Pet. v.
1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.iii.xv-p1.2"></span>.
Vol. i. p. 16, this series\], and yet it is found in Ignatius. (3) The
word <span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.xv-p1.4"></span>χειροτονέω
</span>is here used in the sense of “elect” or “appoint” (by show of
hands), and not in that of “ordain” (by laying on of hands). The former
is the New Testament sense ([Acts xiv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md)<span id="viii.iii.xv-p1.5"></span>;
[2 Cor. viii. 19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019.md)<span
id="viii.iii.xv-p1.6"></span>), also in Ignatius; the latter sense is
found in <span id="viii.iii.xv-p1.7"></span>Apostolic Canons, i. (4) The
choice by the people also indicates an early period.

<span id="viii.iii.xv-p4"></span> Or, “ministry.” This clause and the
following verse indicate that the extraordinary ministers were as yet
more highly regarded.

<span id="viii.iii.xv-p6"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xv-p6.1"></span>ἀστοχέω</span>, occurring here, means “to
miss the mark;” in New Testament, “to err” or, “swerve.” See [1 Tim. i.
6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.iii.xv-p6.2"></span>,
vi. 21; [2 Tim. ii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md)<span
