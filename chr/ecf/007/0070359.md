#### <span id="iii.v.l-p0.1"></span>Chap. L.

<span id="iii.v.l-p1"></span>Thus did God subdue all those who
persecuted His name, so that neither root nor branch of them remained;
for <span id="iii.v.l-p1.1"></span>Licinius, as soon as he was
established in sovereign authority, commanded that <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.2"></span>Valeria should be put to death. <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.3"></span>Daia, although exasperated against her, never
ventured to do this, not even after his discomfiture and flight, and
when he knew that his end approached. <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.4"></span>Licinius commanded that <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.5"></span>Candidianus also should be put to death. He was
the son of <span id="iii.v.l-p1.6"></span>Galerius by a concubine, and
<span id="iii.v.l-p1.7"></span>Valeria, having no children, had adopted
him. On the news of the death of <span id="iii.v.l-p1.8"></span>Daia,
she came in disguise to the court of <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.9"></span>Licinius, anxious to observe what might befall
<span id="iii.v.l-p1.10"></span>Candidianus. The youth, presenting
himself at Nicomedia, had an outward show of honour paid to him, and,
while he suspected no harm, was killed. Hearing of this catastrophe,
<span id="iii.v.l-p1.11"></span>Valeria immediately fled. The Emperor
<span id="iii.v.l-p1.12"></span>Severus left a son, <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.13"></span>Severianus, arrived at man’s estate, who
accompanied <span id="iii.v.l-p1.14"></span>Daia in his flight from the
field of battle. <span id="iii.v.l-p1.15"></span>Licinius caused him to
be condemned and executed, under the pretence that, on the death of
<span id="iii.v.l-p1.16"></span>Daia, he had intentions of assuming the
imperial purple. Long before this time, <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.17"></span>Candidianus and <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.18"></span>Severianus, apprehending evil from <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.19"></span>Licinius, had chosen to remain with <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.20"></span>Daia; while <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.21"></span>Valeria favoured <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.22"></span>Licinius, and was willing to bestow on him
that which she had denied to <span id="iii.v.l-p1.23"></span>Daia, all
rights accruing to her as the widow of <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.24"></span>Galerius. <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.25"></span>Licinius also put to death <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.26"></span>Maximus, the son of <span
id="iii.v.l-p1.27"></span>Daia, a boy eight years old, and a daughter of
<span id="iii.v.l-p1.28"></span>Daia, who was seven years old, and had
been betrothed to <span id="iii.v.l-p1.29"></span>Candidianus. But
before their death, their mother had been thrown into the Orontes, in
which river she herself had frequently commanded chaste women to be
drowned. So, by the unerring and just judgment of God, all the impious
received according to the deeds that they had done.
