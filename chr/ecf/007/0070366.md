#### <span id="iii.vi.iii-p0.1"></span>General Note.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p1"></span><span id="iii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>There
is no <span class="sc"><span id="iii.vi.iii-p1.2"></span>ms</span>
authority for ascribing the above to <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p1.3"></span>Lactantius. “It does not, in the least, come
up to the purity and eloquence of his style,” says <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p1.4"></span>Dupin; and the same candid author notes the
“adoration of the cross” as fatal to any such claim. <span
id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md)  

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p3"></span>Of the following poem, on Easter, <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p3.1"></span>Dupin says: “It is attributed to <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p3.2"></span>Venantius upon the testimony of some <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p3.3"></span>mss. in the Vatican Library.” This writer
became known to <span id="iii.vi.iii-p3.4"></span>Gregory of Tours, who
died about <span id="iii.vi.iii-p3.5"></span>a.d. 595, and seems to have
succeeded him as bishop, dying soon after. <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p3.6"></span>Bede quotes his verse on St. <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p3.7"></span>Alban, <span
id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md) —  

> <span id="iii.vi.iii-p4.3"></span> “<span
> id="iii.vi.iii-p4.5"></span>Albanum egregium fecunda Britannia
> profert,”  

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p5"></span>but styles him “<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p5.1"></span>presbyter <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p5.2"></span>Fortunatus.” He was the author of a poem on
<span id="iii.vi.iii-p5.3"></span>St. Martin, and another, <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p5.4"></span>In Laude Virginum. His works were edited by
<span id="iii.vi.iii-p5.5"></span>Brouverius, a Jesuit.
