#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xl-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLIV.—The Twofold Nativity of Christ is Proved from the Prophets.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xl-p1"></span>That these things should thus take
place as I have set them forth, the prophets had before predicted. In
the writings of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xl-p1.1"></span>Solomon it is thus
written: <span id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520) “The womb of a
virgin was strengthened, and conceived: and a virgin was impregned, and
became a mother in great pity.” In Isaiah <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521) it is thus written: “Behold, a
virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and ye shall call His name
Immanuel;” which, being interpreted, is God with us. <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522) For He was with us on the earth,
when He assumed flesh; and He was no less God in man, and man in God.
That He was both God and man was declared before by the prophets. That
He was God, Isaiah <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523) thus
declares: “They shall fall down unto Thee, they shall make supplication
unto Thee; since God is in Thee, and we knew it not, even the God of
Israel. They shall be ashamed and confounded, all of them who oppose
themselves to Thee, and shall go to confusion.” Also <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xl-p5.2"></span>Jeremiah: <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524) “This is our God, and there shall
none other be compared unto Him; He hath found out all the way of
knowledge, and hath given it unto <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xl-p6.2"></span>Jacob His servant, and to Israel His
beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt among men.”
Likewise that He was man, the same <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xl-p6.3"></span>Jeremiah <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525) says: “And He is man, and who knew
Him?” <span id="iii.ii.viii.xl-p7.1"></span>Isaiah also thus
speaks: <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526) “And the Lord shall
send them a man who shall save them, and with judgment shall He heal
them.” Also <span id="iii.ii.viii.xl-p8.2"></span>Moses himself in the
book of Numbers: <span id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527) “There shall
come a star out of Jacob, and a man shall arise out of Israel.” For this
cause, therefore, being God, He took upon Him flesh, that, becoming a
mediator <span id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528) between God and man,
having <span id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xl-Page_240"></span>overcome death, He might by His
guidance lead man to God.
