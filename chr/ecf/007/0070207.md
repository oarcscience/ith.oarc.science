#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIV.—The Actions of Saturnus and Uranus Taken from the Historians.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1"></span>Let us pass on to former things,
that we may discover the origin of the whole error. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.1"></span>Saturnus is said to have been born of
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.2"></span>Cœlus and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.3"></span>Terra. This is plainly incredible; but
there is a certain reason why it is thus related, and he who is ignorant
of this rejects it as a fable. That <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.4"></span>Uranus was the father of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.5"></span>Saturnus, both <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.6"></span>Hermes affirms, and sacred history
teaches. When <span id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.7"></span>Trismegistus said
that there were very few men of perfect learning, he enumerated among
them his relatives, <span id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.8"></span>Uranus, <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.9"></span>Saturnus, and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.10"></span>Mercurius. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.11"></span>Euhemerus relates that the same <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.12"></span>Uranus was the first who reigned on
earth, using these words: “In the beginning <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.13"></span>Cœlus first had the chief power on
earth: he instituted and prepared that kingdom for himself together with
his brothers.” <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md)
