#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Of Wisdom Likewise, and Religion, and of the Right of Father and Lord.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p1"></span>By these things it is evident how
closely connected are wisdom and religion. Wisdom relates to sons, and
this relation requires love; religion to servants, and this relation
requires fear. For as the former are bound to love and honour their
father, so are the latter bound to respect and venerate their lord. But
with respect to God, who is one only, inasmuch as He sustains the
twofold character both of Father and Lord, we are bound both to love
Him, inasmuch as we are sons, and to fear Him, inasmuch <span
id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span id="iii.ii.iv.iv-Page_104"></span>as
we are servants. <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) Religion,
therefore, cannot be divided from wisdom, nor can wisdom be separated
from religion; because it is the same God, who ought to be understood,
which is the part of wisdom, and to be honoured, which is the part of
religion. But wisdom precedes, religion follows; for the knowledge of
God comes first, His worship is the result of knowledge. Thus in the two
names there is but one meaning, though it seems to be different in each
case. For the one is concerned with the understanding, the other with
action. But, however, they resemble two streams flowing from one
fountain. But the fountain of wisdom and religion is God; and if these
two streams shall turn aside from Him, they must be dried up: for they
who are ignorant of Him cannot be wise or religious.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p3"></span>Thus it comes to pass that
philosophers, and those who worship <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p3.1"></span>many gods, either resemble disinherited
sons or runaway slaves, because the one do not seek their father, nor
the other their master. And as they who are disinherited do not attain
to the inheritance of their father, nor runaway slaves impunity, so
neither will philosophers receive immortality, which is the inheritance
of the heavenly kingdom, that is, the chief good, which they especially
seek; nor will the worshippers of gods escape the penalty of everlasting
death, which is the punishment of the true Master against those who are
deserters <span id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) of His majesty and
name. But that God is Father and also Lord was unknown to both, to the
worshippers of the gods as well as to the professors of wisdom
themselves: inasmuch as they either thought that nothing at all was to
be worshipped; or they approved of false religions; or, although they
understood the strength and power of the Supreme God (as <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p4.1"></span>Plato, who says that there is one God,
Creator of the world, and <span id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p4.2"></span>Marcus
Tullius, who acknowledges that man has been produced by the Supreme God
in an excellent condition), nevertheless they did not render the worship
due to Him as to the supreme Father, which was their befitting and
necessary duty. But that the gods cannot be fathers or lords, is
declared not only by their multitude, as I have shown above, <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) but also by reason: because it is not
reported that man was made by gods, nor is it found that the gods
themselves preceded the origin of man, since it appears that there were
men on the earth before the birth of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p5.2"></span>Vulcan, and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p5.3"></span>Liber, and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p5.4"></span>Apollo, and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p5.5"></span>Jupiter himself. But the creation of man
is not accustomed to be assigned to <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p5.6"></span>Saturnus, nor to his father <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p5.7"></span>Cœlus.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p6"></span>But if none of those who are
worshipped is said to have originally formed and created man, it follows
that none of these can be called the father of man, and so none of them
can be God. Therefore it is not lawful to worship those by whom man was
not produced, for he could not be produced by many. Therefore the one
and only God ought to be worshipped, who was before <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p6.1"></span>Jupiter, and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p6.2"></span>Saturnus, and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p6.3"></span>Cœlus himself, and the earth. For He must
have fashioned man, who, before the creation of man, finished the heaven
and the earth. He alone is to be called Father who created us; He alone
is to be considered Lord who rules, who has the true and perpetual power
of life and death. And he who does not adore Him is a foolish servant,
who flees from or does not know his Master; and an undutiful son, who
either hates or is ignorant of his true Father.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p2"></span> Fear, in the language of the prophets
often implies reverence of the divine majesty. <span

“A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a
father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear?”

<span id="iii.ii.iv.iv-p4"></span> Literally, runaways. The reference
is, as before, to runaway slaves.
