#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chap. VI.—Almighty God Begat His Son; And the Testimonies of the <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p0.2"></span>Sibyls and of Trismegistus Concerning Him.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p1"></span>God, therefore, the contriver and
founder of all things, as we have said in the second book, before He
commenced this excellent work of the world, begat a pure and
incorruptible Spirit, whom He called His Son. And although He had
afterwards created by Himself innumerable other beings, whom we call
angels, this first-begotten, however, was the only one whom He
considered worthy of being called by the divine name, as being powerful
in His Father’s excellence and majesty. But that there is a Son of the
Most High God, who is possessed of the greatest power, is shown not only
by the unanimous utterances of the prophets, but also by the declaration
of <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Trismegistus and the predictions
of the Sibyls. <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p1.2"></span>Hermes, in the book
which is entitled <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p1.3"></span>The Perfect Word,
made use of these words: “The Lord and Creator of all things, whom we
have thought right to call God, since He made the second God visible and
sensible. But I use the term sensible, not because He Himself perceives
(for the question is not whether He Himself perceives), but because He
leads <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) to perception and to
intelligence. Since, therefore, He made Him first, and alone, and one
only, He appeared to Him beautiful, and most full of all good things;
and He hallowed Him, and altogether loved Him as His own Son.” The <span
id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p2.3"></span>Erythræan Sibyl, in the beginning of her
poem, which she commenced with the Supreme God, proclaims the Son of God
as the leader and commander of all, in these verses:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p2.4"></span> “The nourisher and creator of all
> things, who placed the sweet breath in all, and made God the leader of
> all.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p3"></span>And again, at the end of the same
poem:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p3.1"></span> “But whom God gave for faithful
> men to honour.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p4"></span>And another <span
id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p4.1"></span>Sibyl enjoins that He ought to be known:—
 

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p4.2"></span> “Know Him as your God, who is the
> Son of God.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p5"></span>Assuredly He is the very Son of God,
who by that most wise King Solomon, full of divine inspiration, spake
these things which we have added: <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) , “God founded <span
id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) me in the beginning of His ways, in
His work before the ages. He set me up in the beginning, before He made
the earth, and before He established the depths, before the fountains of
waters came forth: the Lord begat me before all the hills; He made the
regions, and the uninhabitable <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md)
boundaries under the heaven. When He prepared the heaven, I was by Him:
and when He separated His own seat, when He made the strong clouds above
the winds, and when He strengthened the mountains, and placed them under
heaven; when He laid the strong foundations of the earth, I was with Him
arranging all things. I was He in whom He delighted: I was daily
delighted, when He rejoiced, the world being completed.” But on this
account <span id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p8.3"></span>Trismegistus spoke of Him as
“the artificer of God,” and the <span
id="iii.ii.iv.vi-p8.4"></span>Sibyl calls Him “Counsellor,” because He
is endowed by God the Father with such wisdom and strength, that God
employed both His wisdom and hands in the creation of the world.
