#### <span id="iii.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIII.—Of the Lower Members.

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Poteram nunc ego ipsorum quoque genitalium
membrorum mirificam rationem tibi exponere, nisi me pudor ab hujusmodi
sermone revocaret: itaque a nobis indumento verecundiæ, quæ sunt pudenda
velentur. Quod ad hanc rem attinet, queri satis est, homines impios ac
profanos summum nefas admittere, qui divinum et admirabile Dei opus, ad
propagandam successionem inexcogitabili ratione provisum et effectum,
vel ad turpissimos quæ stus, vel ad obscœnæ libidinis pudenda opera
convertunt, ut jam nihil aliud ex re sanctissima petant, quam inanem et
sterilem voluptatem.  

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p2"></span>How is it with respect to the other
parts of the body? Are they without order and beauty? The flesh rounded
off into the <span id="iii.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>nates, how adapted to
the office of sitting! and this also more firm than in the other limbs,
lest by the pressure of the bulk of the body it should give way to the
bones. Also the length of the thighs drawn out, and strengthened by
broader muscles, in order that it might more easily sustain the weight
of the body; and as this is gradually contracted, it is bounded <span
id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906.md) by the knees, the comely
joints <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) of which supply a bend
which is most adapted for walking and sitting. Also the legs not drawn
out in an equal manner, lest an unbecoming figure should deform the
feet; but they are at once strengthened and adorned by <span
id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xiii-Page_295"></span>well-turned <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908.md) calves gently standing out and
gradually diminishing.  

<span id="iii.iv.xiii-p6"></span>But in the soles of the feet there is
the same plan as in the hands, but yet very different: for since these
are, as it were, the foundations of the whole body, <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909.md) the admirable Artificer has not
made them of a round appearance, lest man should be unable to stand, or
should need other feet for standing, as is the case with quadrupeds; but
He has formed them of a longer and more extended shape, that they might
make the body firm by their flatness, <span
id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910.md) from which circumstance their name
was given to them. The toes are of the same number with the fingers, for
the sake of appearance rather than utility; and on this account they are
both joined together, and short, and put together by gradations; and
that which is the greatest of these, since it was not befitting that it
should be separated from the others, as in the hand, has been so
arranged in order, that it appears to differ from the others in
magnitude and the small space which intervenes. This beautiful
union <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911.md) of them strengthens the
pressure of the feet with no slight aid; for we cannot be excited to
running, unless, our toes being pressed against the ground, and resting
upon the soil, we take an impetus and a spring. I appear to have
explained all things of which the plan is capable of being understood. I
now come to those things which are either doubtful or obscure.
