#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chap. XX.—Of the Judgment of Christ, of Christians, and of the Soul.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p1"></span>After these things the lower regions
shall be opened, and the dead shall rise again, on whom the same King
and God shall pass judgment, to whom the supreme Father shall give the
great power both of judging and of reigning. And respecting this
judgment and reign, it is thus found in the <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Erythræan Sibyl:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p1.2"></span> “When this shall receive its
> fated accomplishment, and the judgment of the immortal God shall now
> come to mortals, the great judgment shall come upon men, and the
> beginning.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p2"></span>Then in another:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p2.1"></span> “And then the gaping earth shall
> show a Tartarean chaos; and all kings shall come to the judgment-seat
> of God.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p3"></span>And in another place in the same:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p3.1"></span> “Rolling along the heavens, I
> will open the caverns of the earth; and then I will raise the dead,
> loosing fate and the sting of death; and afterwards I will call them
> into judgment, judging the life of pious and impious men.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p4"></span>Not all men, however, shall then be
judged by God, but those only who have been exercised in the religion of
God. For they who have not known God, since sentence cannot be passed
upon them for their acquittal, are already judged and condemned, since
the Holy Scriptures testify that the wicked shall not arise to
judgment. <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406) Therefore they who
have known God shall be judged, and their deeds, that is, their evil
works, shall be compared and weighed against their good ones: so that if
those which are good and just are more <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407) and weighty, they may be given to a
life of blessedness; but if the evil exceed, they may be condemned to
punishment. Here, perhaps, some one will say, If the soul is immortal,
how is it represented as capable of suffering, and sensible of
punishment? For if it shall be punished on account of its deserts, it is
plain that it will be sensible of pain, and even of death. If it is not
liable to death, not even to pain, it follows that it is not capable of
suffering.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p7"></span>This question or argument is thus met
by the Stoics: that the souls of men continue to exist, and are not
annihilated <span id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408) by the
intervention of death: that the souls, moreover, of those who have been
just, being pure, and incapable of suffering, and happy, return to the
heavenly abodes from which they had their origin, or are borne to some
happy plains, where they may enjoy wonderful pleasures; but that the
wicked, since they have defiled themselves with evil passions, have a
kind of middle nature, between that of an immortal and a mortal, and
have something of weakness, from the contagion of the flesh; and being
enslaved to its desires and lusts, they contract an indelible stain and
earthly blot; and when this has become entirely inherent through length
of time, souls are given over to its nature, so that, though they cannot
altogether be extinguished, inasmuch as they are from God, nevertheless
they become liable to torment through the taint of the body, which being
burnt in by means of sins, produces a feeling of pain. Which sentiment
is thus expressed by the poet: <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p9.3"></span> “Nay, when at last the life has
> fled,  
> And left the body cold and dead,  
> E’en then there passes not away  
> The painful heritage of clay:  
> Full many a long contracted stain  
> Perforce must linger deep in grain.  
> So penal sufferings they endure  
> For ancient crime, to make them pure.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p10"></span>These things are near to the
truth. <span id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410) For the soul, when
separated from the body, is, as the same poet says, <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411) such as  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p12.4"></span> “No vision of the drowsy
> night,  
> No airy current half so light,”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xx-p13"></span>because it is a spirit, and by its
very slightness incapable of being perceived, but only by us who are
corporeal but capable of being perceived by God, since it belongs to Him
to be able to do all things.
