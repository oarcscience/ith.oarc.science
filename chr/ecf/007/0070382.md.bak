<span id="vi.ii.vii"></span>

#### <span id="vi.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>from the seventh chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>2. “And
I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the
living God.”\] He speaks of <span id="vi.ii.vii-p1.2"></span>Elias the
prophet, who is the precursor of the times of Antichrist, for the
restoration and establishment of the churches from the great and
intolerable persecution. We read <span id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span
id="vi.ii.vii-Page_352"></span>that these things are predicted in the
opening of the Old and New Testament; for He says by <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p1.3"></span>Malachi: “Lo, I will send to you <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p1.4"></span>Elias the Tishbite, to turn the hearts of the
fathers to the children, according to the time of calling, to recall the
Jews to the faith of the people that succeed them.” <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) And to that end He shows, as we
have said, that the number of those that shall believe, of the Jews and
of the nations, is a great multitude which no man was able to number.
Moreover, we read in the Gospel that the prayers of the Church are sent
from heaven by an angel, and that they are received against wrath, and
that the kingdom of Antichrist is cast out and extinguished by holy
angels; for He says: “Pray that ye enter not into temptation: for there
shall be a great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of
the world; and except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should
be saved.” <span id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) Therefore He shall
send these seven great archangels to smite the kingdom of Antichrist;
for He Himself also thus said: “Then the Son of man shall send His
messengers; and they shall gather together His elect from the four
corners of the wind, from the one end of heaven even to the other end
thereof.” <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) For, moreover, He
previously says by the prophet: “Then shall there be peace for our land,
when there shall arise in it seven shepherds and eight attacks of men;
and they shall encircle Assur,” that is, Antichrist, “in the trench of
Nimrod,” <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) that is, in the
nation of the devil, by the spirit of the Church. Similarly when the
keepers of the house shall be moved. Moreover, the Lord Himself, in the
parable to the apostles, when the labourers had come to Him and said,
“Lord, did not we sow good seed in Thy field? whence, then, hath it
tares? answered them, An enemy hath done this. And they said to Him,
Lord, wilt Thou, then, that we go and root them up? And He said, Nay,
but let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the
harvest I will say to the reapers, that they gather the tares and make
bundles of them, and burn them with fire everlasting, but that they
gather the wheat into my barns.” <span
id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md) The Apocalypse here shows,
therefore, that these reapers, and shepherds, and labourers, are the
angels. And the trumpet is the word of power. And although the same
thing recurs in the phials, still it is not said as if it occurred
twice, but because what is decreed by the Lord to happen shall be once
for all; for this cause it is said twice. What, therefore, He said too
little in the trumpets, is here found in the phials. We must not regard
the order of what is said, because frequently the Holy Spirit, when He
has traversed even to the end of the last times, returns again to the
same times, and fills up what He had <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p6.2"></span>before failed to say. <span
id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) Nor must we look for order in the
Apocalypse; but we must follow the meaning of those things which are
prophesied. Therefore in the trumpets and phials is signified either the
desolation of the plagues that are sent upon the earth, or the madness
of Antichrist himself, or the cutting off of the peoples, or the
diversity of the plagues, or the hope in the kingdom of the saints, or
the ruin of states, or the great overthrow of Babylon, that is, the
Roman state.  

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p8"></span><span id="vi.ii.vii-p8.1"></span>9.
“After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man was able
to number, of every nation, tribe, and people, and tongue, clothed with
white robes.”\] What the great multitude out of every tribe implies, is
to show the number of the elect out of all believers, who, being
cleansed by baptism in the blood of the Lamb, have made their robes
white, keeping the grace which they have received.
