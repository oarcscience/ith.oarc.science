#### <span id="vi.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>GENERAL NOTES BY THE AMERICAN EDITOR

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p1"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>The</span> whole subject of the Apocalypse is
so treated, <span id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) in the <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p2.1"></span>Speaker's Commentary, as to elucidate many
questions suggested by the primitive commentators of this series, and to
furnish the latest judgments of critics on the subject. It is so immense
a matter, however, as to render annotations on patristic <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p2.2"></span>specialties impossible in a work like this.
Every reader must feel how apposite is the sententious saying of <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p2.3"></span>Augustine: “Apocalypsis Joannis tot sacramenta
quot verba.”  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p3"></span>2. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p3.1"></span>The
seven spirits, p. 344, ver. 4. That is, the one Spirit in His seven-fold
gifts. He now fulfills the promise of Christ, “He shall show you things
to come.” Without this complement the Church would lack assurance that
her great Head upon the throne has ordered and limited the whole course
of this world for her conflicts and her final triumph by the Spirit's
power. St. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p3.3"></span>John’s rapture was the
Spirit’s work: “I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day.” <span
id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md) The whole Apocalypse is an Easter
sermon (on the text, i. 18) and an Easter song (vers. 9-14, and <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p4.4"></span>passim). It supplements the appearances of the
risen Redeemer for <span id="vi.ii.xx-p4.5"></span>identification, by a
manifestation, which is the Church’s assurance of His <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p4.6"></span>glorification, and of His perpetual work in
her and for her, as well as of His presence with her, by the Spirit.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p5"></span>3.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p5.1"></span> Seven
golden candlesticks, p. 344, ver. 12. The symbol of the seven-fold
Spirit in the Church. On the Arch of Titus this symbol had just been set
up as proof of its removal from the Mosaic Church. It is now found to be
transferred to the “seven churches,” a symbol of the Catholic
Church <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) or the “communion of
saints.” The threatening of removal from particular churches derives
force from the (then) recent removal out of Jerusalem.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p7"></span>4. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p7.1"></span>All the
Saints shall assemble, p. 345, ver. 15. Our author clings to the purer
Chiliasm of <span id="vi.ii.xx-p7.3"></span>Commodian, to which <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p7.4"></span>Augustine had now given the death-blow by his
famous retraction. <span id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p9"></span>5.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p9.1"></span> New
forms of prophesying, p. 347, ver.17. A retrospective glance at
Montanism, and a <span id="vi.ii.xx-p9.3"></span>caveat against the
mistakes of <span id="vi.ii.xx-p9.4"></span>Tertullian.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p10"></span>6.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p10.1"></span> I
will vomit thee, p. 347, ver. 17. Bishop<span
id="vi.ii.xx-p10.3"></span> Wordsworth suggests, that, if the canon of
Scripture compiled by the church of Laodicea lacks the Apocalypse, its
terrible reproof of that church may have influenced its unwillingness to
accept it. Accordingly she was <span id="vi.ii.xx-p10.4"></span>vomited,
and perished in the Saracen invasion.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p11"></span>7.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p11.1"></span> That
is the Spirit, p. 348, ver. 1. Christ’s divine nature as distinguished
from his flesh. <span id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) “In a word,”
says Professor <span id="vi.ii.xx-p12.1"></span>Milligan, <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) “<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xx-p13.2"></span>πνευμα</span> is a short expression for our
Lord’s resurrection state.” A truth, but based on the distinction
between the flesh of Christ and His spiritual nature as the Word. See
<span id="vi.ii.xx-p13.3"></span>Tertullian, <span
id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) vol. iii. p. 609, note 5, and p.
610, note 5: also [2 Cor. iii.
17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.ii.xx-p14.6"></span>.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p15"></span>8.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p15.1"></span> The
genealogy <span id="vi.ii.xx-p15.2"></span>of Mary<span
id="vi.ii.xx-p15.3"></span>, p. 348, vers. 7-10. It is remarkable that
St. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p15.5"></span>Matthew should be credited with
this, and not St. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p15.6"></span>Luke, who in the
sixteenth century <span id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) began to be
regarded as giving the ancestry of <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p16.3"></span>Mary. See <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p16.4"></span>Africanus <span
id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) on the subject, and my
elucidation, <span id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) in which I
followed <span id="vi.ii.xx-p18.2"></span>Wordsworth. Though I had
already prepared the pages of <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p18.3"></span>Victorinus for the press, I failed to note at
that time this modification of the general truth, that antiquity regards
both genealogies as those of <span id="vi.ii.xx-p18.4"></span>Joseph.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p19"></span>9.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p19.1"></span> Dan
himself, p. 349, ver. 8. Here is a touch of Chiliasm again, i.e., of the
better sort. Even <span id="vi.ii.xx-p19.3"></span>Dan is promised a
restoration: and the use of [Gen. xlix.
16](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#016.md)<span id="vi.ii.xx-p19.4"></span>
for that intent is noteworthy, as compared with [Rev. vii.
5-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#005.md)<span id="vi.ii.xx-p19.5"></span>,
where <span id="vi.ii.xx-p19.6"></span>Dan is omitted. But <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p19.7"></span>Hippolytus takes a very different view of the
same text. <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p21"></span>10.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p21.1"></span>
Hades, p. 351. “A region withdrawn from punishment and fires,” says our
author. He identifies it with paradise, and shows that in his day the
Latin churches knew of no purgatorial fires. He knows of nothing but a
place for those “who die in the Lord,” and a place for the wicked. It is
perpetually overlooked, that, in the fiction of “purgatory,” it is only
the righteous who are entitled to it: none but those dying in full
communion with the Church having any portion in it, or any title to
Masses for their repose. Of all this our author had no conception. <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p23"></span>11.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p23.1"></span> To
take the book and eat it up, p. 353, ver. 10. We must not fail to note
with this the passage [Jer. xv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md)<span id="vi.ii.xx-p23.3"></span>,
where the Revised Version pedantically sacrifices the Septuagint
reading, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xx-p23.4"></span>ὁ λόγος
σου</span>, (which is followed by the Vulgate), distinguishing “sermones
tui” from “Verbum tuum.” The Seventy have testified to this distinction
in their day, and their copies of the Hebrew must have supported it. So
understood, what riches in the text of <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p23.5"></span>Jeremiah!  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p24"></span>12.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p24.1"></span>
Thessalonians, p. 354, ver. 7. On which much that is suggestive is said
by St. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p24.3"></span>Augustine, though he confesses,
concerning what St. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p24.4"></span>Paul had said to
the Thessalonians, “Ego prorsus quid dixerit me fateor ignorare.” See
<span id="vi.ii.xx-p24.5"></span>De Civ. Dei, lib. xx. cap. 19, p. 685,
ed. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p24.6"></span>Migne.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p25"></span>13.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p25.1"></span> The
woman, p. 355, ver. 1. Compare vol. vi. p. 337, note 4, and Elucidation
II. p. 355. It is quite important to observe the voice of antiquity on a
matter which, in our own times, has been made a stumbling-block to souls
by a wanton, personal act of the Bishop of Rome and his dogma of the
“Immaculate Conception.”  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p26"></span>14.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p26.1"></span> The
hope of those that sleep, p. 355, ver. 1. To make our author consistent
with himself (see note 10, <span id="vi.ii.xx-p26.3"></span>supra), we
should read thus: “But they have in their darkness a light (some think)
such as the moon.” Here, however, it seems to me, he is giving his mind
to “the Church of Fathers and Prophets” exclusively, in which <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p26.4"></span>its “saints and apostles” were for a time
waiting and looking for the Man-child. Even that Church of the Hebrews
had, in Hades, light “like that of the moon,” where they reposed in
Abraham’s bosom; but Christ removed them into a fairer region, i.e.,
Paradise, when He illuminated Hades, and then became “the first-fruits
of them that slept.” Such seems to be the sense.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p27"></span>15.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p27.1"></span> In a
certain Greek codex, p. 357, ver. 18. Can <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xx-p27.3"></span>αντεμος</span> here be a reference to <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p27.4"></span>Anthemius, of the kindred of <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p27.5"></span>Julian (<span id="vi.ii.xx-p27.6"></span>d.
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.xx-p27.7"></span>a.d.</span> 472)? His
history, mixed up with that of <span id="vi.ii.xx-p27.8"></span>Ricimer,
connects with <span id="vi.ii.xx-p27.9"></span>Genseric, who died <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.xx-p27.10"></span>a.d.</span> 477.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p28"></span>16. <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p28.1"></span>Sea<span id="vi.ii.xx-p28.2"></span> of the
north, p. 358, ver. 11. The Mediterranean, near Mount Carmel, is “the
sea of Phœnice,” I suppose: but how the Arabian Gulf can be called the
sea of the north, I do not comprehend. As <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p28.4"></span>Routh says, the manuscripts must have been
much corrupted.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p29"></span>17.<span id="vi.ii.xx-p29.1"></span> Two
resurrections, p. 359, ver. 5. Here our author, who is supposed to be
the contemporary of St. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p29.3"></span>Augustine,
accepts his final judgment. <span id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md)
But <span id="vi.ii.xx-p30.2"></span>Victorinus was a Chiliast of the
better sort, according to St. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p30.3"></span>Jerome.
This confirms the corruption of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.xx-p30.4"></span>mss</span>. Indeed, if the <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p30.5"></span>Victorinus mentioned by <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p30.6"></span>Jerome be the same as our author, the mention
of <span id="vi.ii.xx-p30.7"></span>Genseric proves the subsequent
interpolation of his works.  

<span id="vi.ii.xx-p31"></span>18. It is evident that the fragment which
is here preserved, if, indeed, it be the work of <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p31.1"></span>Caius Marius Victorinus, surnamed Afer, is
full of the corrections of some pious disciple of St. <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p31.2"></span>Augustine who lived much later. The reader
must consult <span id="vi.ii.xx-p31.3"></span>Lardner, <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) and compare <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p32.2"></span>Routh, whose notes on this treatise are
indeed few. He does not think the reference to <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p32.3"></span>abbots <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) of any consequence in determining
its age, because he finds <span class="Foreign"><span
id="vi.ii.xx-p33.3"></span>albatorum</span> elsewhere sustained as the
true reading, i.e., those “<span id="vi.ii.xx-p33.4"></span>made white
in the blood of the Lamb.” But the great probability that there were two
authors of the name living in different ages seems more than suspected
by the learned. <span id="vi.ii.xx-p33.5"></span>Dupin, who calls him
<span id="vi.ii.xx-p33.6"></span>Marius without the<span
id="vi.ii.xx-p33.7"></span> Caius (changed to <span
id="vi.ii.xx-p33.8"></span>Fabius by the English translator), leaves one
yet more in a mist as to the identity of our author with the one he
writes about.
