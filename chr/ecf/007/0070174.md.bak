#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.x-p0.1"></span>Chap. X.—Of Vices and Virtues, and of Life and Death.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.x-p1"></span>Let us now in turn pass on to those
things which are opposed to virtue, that from these also the immortality
of the soul may be inferred. All vices are for a time; for they are
excited for the present. The impetuosity of anger is appeased when
vengeance has been taken; the pleasure of the body puts an end <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361.md) to lust; desire is destroyed either
by the full enjoyment of the objects <span id="page_207">p. 207</span>
<span id="iii.ii.vii.x-Page_207"></span>which it seeks, or by the
excitement of other affections; ambition, when it has gained the honours
which it wished for, loses <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md)
its strength; likewise the other vices are unable to stand their ground
and remain, but they are ended by the very enjoyment which they desire.
Therefore they withdraw and return. But virtue is perpetual, without any
intermission; nor can he who has once taken it up depart from it. For if
it should have any interruption, <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363.md) if we can at any time do without
it, vices, which always oppose virtue, will return. Therefore it has not
been grasped, if it deserts its post, if at any time it withdraws
itself. But when it has established for itself a firm abode, it must
necessarily be engaged in every act; nor can it faithfully drive away
and put to flight vices, unless it shall fortify with a perpetual guard
the breast which it inhabits. Therefore the uninterrupted duration <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) of virtue itself shows that the
soul of man, if it has received virtue, remains permanent, because
virtue is perpetual, and it is the human mind alone which receives
virtue. Since, therefore, vices are contrary to virtue, the whole
systems must of necessity differ from and be contrary to each other.
Because vices are commotions and perturbations of the soul; virtue, on
the contrary, is mildness and tranquillity of mind. Because vices are
temporary, and of short duration; virtue is perpetual and constant, and
always consistent with itself. Because the fruits of vices, that is,
pleasures, equally with themselves, are short and temporary, therefore
the fruit and reward of virtue are everlasting. Because the advantage of
vices is immediate, therefore that of virtue is future.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.x-p6"></span>Thus it happens that in this life
there is no reward of virtue, because virtue itself still exists. For
as, when vices are completed in their performance, pleasure and their
rewards follow; so, when virtue has been ended, its reward follows. But
virtue is never ended except by death, since its highest office is in
the undergoing of death: therefore the reward of virtue is after death.
In fine, <span id="iii.ii.vii.x-p6.1"></span>Cicero, in his <span
id="iii.ii.vii.x-p6.2"></span>Tusculan Disputations, <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) perceived, though with doubt, that
the chief good does not happen to man except after death. “A man will
go,” he says, “with confident spirit, if circumstances shall so happen,
to death, in which we have ascertained that there is either the chief
good or no evil.” Death, therefore, does not extinguish man, but admits
him to the reward of virtue. But he who has contaminated himself, <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) as the same writer says, with vices
and crimes, and has been the slave of pleasure, he truly, being
condemned, shall suffer eternal punishment, which the sacred writings
call the second death, which is both eternal and full of the severest
torments. <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) For as two lives
are proposed to man, of which the one belongs to the soul, the other to
the body; so also two deaths are proposed,—one relating to the body,
which all must undergo according to nature, the other relating to the
soul, which is acquired by wickedness and avoided by virtue. As this
life is temporary and has fixed limits, because it belongs to the body;
so also death is in like manner temporary and has a fixed end, because
it affects the body.
