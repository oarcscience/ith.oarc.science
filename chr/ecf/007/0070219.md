#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXI.—Of Knowledge and Supposition.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxvii-p1"></span>Moreover, there are two things
which appear to fall under the subject of philosophy—knowledge and
supposition; and if these are taken away, philosophy altogether falls to
the ground. But the chief of the philosophers themselves have taken away
both from philosophy. <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Socrates
took away knowledge, <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxvii-p1.2"></span>Zeno
supposition. Let us see whether they were right in doing so. Wisdom is,
as <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxvii-p1.3"></span>Cicero defined it, <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) the knowledge of divine and human
things. Now if this definition is true, wisdom does not come within the
power of man. For who of mortals can assume this to himself, to profess
that he knows divine and human things? I say nothing of human affairs;
for although they are connected with divine, yet, since they belong to
man, let us grant that it is possible for man to know them. Certainly he
cannot know divine things by himself, since he is a man; whereas he who
knows them must be divine, and therefore God. But man is neither divine
nor God. Man, therefore, cannot thoroughly know divine things by
himself. No one, therefore, is wise but God, or certainly that man whom
God has taught. But they, because they are neither gods, nor taught by
God, cannot be wise, that is, acquainted with divine and human things.
Knowledge, therefore, is rightly taken away by <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxvii-p2.2"></span>Socrates and the Academics.
Supposition also does not agree with the wise man. For every <span
id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxvii-Page_234"></span>one supposes that of which he is
ignorant. Now, to suppose that you know that of which you are ignorant,
is rashness and folly. Supposition, therefore, was rightly taken away by
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxvii-p2.3"></span>Zeno. If, therefore, there is
no knowledge in man, and there ought to be no supposition, philosophy is
cut up by the roots.
