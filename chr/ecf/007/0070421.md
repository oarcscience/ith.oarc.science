#### <span id="viii.iii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII. <span id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) —Support of Prophets.

<span id="viii.iii.xiii-p2"></span>1. But every true prophet that
willeth to abide among you <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) is
worthy of his support. <span id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) 2. So
also a true teacher is himself worthy, as the workman, of his
support. <span id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) 3. Every
first-fruit, therefore, of the products of wine-press and
threshing-floor, of oxen and of sheep, thou shalt take and give to the
prophets, for they are your high priests. <span
id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) 4. But if ye have not a prophet,
give it to the poor. 5. If thou makest a batch of dough, take the
first-fruit and give according to the commandment. 6. So also when thou
openest a jar of wine or of oil, take the first-fruit and give it to the
prophets; 7. and of money (silver) and clothing and every possession,
take the first-fruit, as it may seem good to thee, and give according to
the commandment.

id="viii.iii.xiii-p0.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xiii-p1"></span> A large part of this chapter is
found in <span id="viii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions,
vii. 28, 29, but with modifications and additions indicating a later
date.  

<span id="fn_2485"></span>[381:2486](0070421.htm#fr_2485.md) <span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xiii-p3"></span> “Who will settle among you” (<span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p3.1"></span>Hitchcock and <span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p3.2"></span>Brown). The itinerant prophets might
become stationary, we infer. Chaps. xi.-xv. point to a movement from an
itinerant and extraordinary ministry to a more settled one.  

<span id="fn_2486"></span>[381:2487](0070421.htm#fr_2486.md) <span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p3.3"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xiii-p4"></span> Lit., “nourishment,” “food.”  

<span id="fn_2487"></span>[381:2488](0070421.htm#fr_2487.md) <span

<span id="viii.iii.xiii-p5"></span> [Matt. x.
10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md)<span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p5.1"></span>; comp. [Luke x.
7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007.md)<span

id="viii.iii.xiii-p5.3"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xiii-p6"></span> This phrase, indicating a sacerdotal
view of the ministry, seems to point to a later date than that claimed
for the <span id="viii.iii.xiii-p6.1"></span>Teaching. Some regard it as
an interpolation: others take it in a figurative sense. In <span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p6.2"></span>Apostolic Constitutions the sacerdotal
view is more marked. \[[1 Pet. ii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p6.3"></span>. If the <span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p6.4"></span>plebs = “priests,” prophets = “high
priests.”\] Here the term is restricted to the prophets: compare <span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p6.5"></span>Schaff <span class="Foreign"><span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p6.6"></span>in loco</span>.
