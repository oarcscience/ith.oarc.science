<span id="ix.iii.iv"></span>

##### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Sec. IV.—On the Management of the Resources Collected for the Support of the Clergy, and the Relief of the Poor.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p1"></span>Let the bishop esteem such food and
raiment sufficient as suits necessity and decency. Let him not make use
of the Lord’s goods as another’s, but moderately; “for the labourer is
worthy of his reward.” <span id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md) Let
him not be luxurious in diet, or fond of idle furniture, but contented
with so much alone as is necessary for his sustenance.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p2.2"></span>Of First-Fruits and Tithes, and After What Manner the Bishop is Himself to Partake of Them, or to Distribute Them to Others.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p3.1"></span>XXV</span>. Let him use those tenths and
first-fruits, which are given according to the command of God, as a man
of God; as also let him dispense in a right manner the free-will
offerings which are brought in on account of the poor, to the orphans,
the widows, the afflicted, and strangers in distress, as having that God
for the examiner of his accounts who has committed the disposition to
him. Distribute to all those in want with righteousness, and yourselves
use the things which belong to the Lord, but do not abuse them; eating
of them, but not eating them all up by yourselves: communicate with
those that are in want, and thereby show yourselves unblameable before
God. For if you shall consume them by yourselves, you will be reproached
by God, who says to such unsatiable people, who <span id="page_409">p.
409</span> <span id="ix.iii.iv-Page_409"></span>alone devour all, “Ye
eat up the milk, and clothe yourselves with the wool;” <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) and in another passage, “Must you
alone live upon the earth”? <span id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md)
Upon which account you are commanded in the law, “Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.” <span id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) Now we
say these things, not as if you might not partake of the fruits of your
labours; for it is written, “Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox
which treadeth out the corn;” <span id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md)
but that you should do it with moderation and righteousness. As,
therefore, the ox that labours in the threshing-floor without a muzzle
eats indeed, but does not eat all up; so do you who labour in the
threshing-floor, that is, in the Church of God, eat of the Church: which
was also the case of the Levites, who served in the tabernacle of the
testimony, which was in all things a type of the Church. Nay, further,
its very name implied that that tabernacle was fore-appointed for a
testimony of the Church. Here, therefore, the Levites also, who attended
upon the tabernacle partook of those things that were offered to God by
all the people,—namely, gifts, offerings, and first-fruits, and tithes,
and sacrifices, and oblations, without disturbance, they and their
wives, and their sons and their daughters. Since their employment was
the ministration to the tabernacle, therefore they had not any lot or
inheritance in the land among the children of Israel, because the
oblations of the people were the lot of Levi, and the inheritance of
their tribe. You, therefore, O bishops, are to your people priests and
Levites, ministering to the holy tabernacle, the holy Catholic Church;
who stand at the altar of the Lord your God, and offer to Him reasonable
and unbloody sacrifices through <span id="ix.iii.iv-p7.3"></span>Jesus
the great High Priest. You are to the laity prophets, rulers, governors,
and kings; the mediators between God and His faithful people, who
receive and declare His word, well acquainted with the Scriptures. Ye
are the voice of God, and witnesses of His will, who bear the sins of
all, and intercede for all; whom, as you have heard, the word severely
threatens if you hide the key of knowledge from men, who are liable to
perdition if you do not declare His will to the people that are under
you; who shall have a certain reward from God, and unspeakable honour
and glory, if you duly minister to the holy tabernacle. For as yours is
the burden, so you receive as your fruit the supply of food and other
necessaries. For you imitate Christ the Lord; and as He “bare the sins
of us all upon the tree” at His crucifixion, the innocent for those who
deserved punishment, so also you ought to make the sins of the people
your own. For concerning our Saviour it is said in Isaiah, “He bears our
sins, and is afflicted for us.” <span
id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) And again: “He bare the sins of
many, and was delivered for our offences.” <span
id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md) As, therefore, you are patterns for
others, so have you Christ for your pattern. As, therefore, He is
concerned for all, so be you for the laity under you. For do not thou
imagine that the office of a bishop is an easy or light burden. As,
therefore, you bear the weight, so have you a right to partake of the
fruits before others, and to impart to those that are in want, as being
to give an account to Him, who without bias will examine your accounts.
For those who attend upon the Church ought to be maintained by the
Church, as being priests, Levites, presidents, and ministers of God; as
it is written in the book of Numbers concerning the priests: “And the
Lord said unto Aaron, Thou, and thy sons, and the house of thy family,
shall bear the iniquities of the holy things of priesthood.” <span
id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md) “Behold, I have given unto you the
charge of the first-fruits, from all that are sanctified to me by the
children of Israel; I have given them for a reward to thee, and to thy
sons after thee, by an ordinance for ever. This shall be yours out of
the holy things, out of the oblations, and out of the gifts, and out of
all the sacrifices, and out of every trespass-offering, and
sin-offerings; and all that they render unto me out of all their holy
things, they shall belong to thee, and to thy sons: in the sanctuary
shall they eat them.” <span id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md) And a
little after: “All the first-fruits of the oil, and of the wine, and of
the wheat, all which they shall give unto the Lord, to thee have I given
them; and all that is first ripe, to thee have I given it, and every
devoted thing. Every first-born of man and of beast, clean and unclean,
and of sacrifice, with the breast, and the right shoulder, all these
appertain to the priests, and to the rest of those belonging to them,
even to the Levites.” <span id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md)  

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p13"></span>Hear this, you of the laity also, the
elect Church of God. For the people were formerly called “the people of
God,” <span id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) and “an holy
nation.” <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md) You, therefore, are
the holy and sacred “Church of God, enrolled in heaven, a royal
priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,” <span
id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) a bride adorned for the Lord God, a
great Church, a faithful Church. Hear attentively now what was said
formerly: oblations and tithes belong to Christ our High Priest, and to
those who minister to Him. Tenths of salvation are the first letter of
the name of <span id="ix.iii.iv-p16.1"></span>Jesus. Hear, O thou Holy
Catholic Church, who hast escaped the ten plagues, and hast received the
ten commandments, <span id="page_410">p. 410</span> <span
id="ix.iii.iv-Page_410"></span>and hast learned the law, and hast kept
the faith, and hast believed in <span id="ix.iii.iv-p16.2"></span>Jesus,
<span id="ix.iii.iv-p16.3"></span>and hast known the decad, and hast
believed in the iota which is the first letter of the name <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p16.4"></span>of Jesus, <span
id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) and art named after His name, and
art established, and shinest in the consummation of His glory. Those
which were then the sacrifices now are prayers, and intercessions, and
thanksgivings. Those which were then first-fruits, and tithes, and
offerings, and gifts, now are oblations, which are presented by holy
bishops to the Lord God, through <span id="ix.iii.iv-p17.2"></span>Jesus
Christ, who has died for them. For these are your high priests, as the
presbyters are your priests, and your present deacons instead of your
Levites; as are also your readers, your singers, your porters, your
deaconesses, your widows, your virgins, and your orphans: but He who is
above all these is the High Priest.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p17.3"></span>According to What Patterns and Dignity Every Order of the Clergy is Appointed by God.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p18"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p18.1"></span>XXVI</span>. The bishop, he is the minister
of the word, the keeper of knowledge, the mediator between God and you
in the several parts of your divine worship. He is the teacher of piety;
and, next after God, he is your father, who has begotten you again to
the adoption of sons by water and the Spirit. He is your ruler and
governor; he is your king and potentate; he is, next after God, your
earthly god, who has a right to be honoured by you. For concerning him,
and such as he, it is that God pronounces, “I have said, Ye are gods;
and ye are all children of the Most High.” <span
id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md) And, “Ye shall not speak evil of
the gods.” <span id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724.md) For let the bishop
preside over you as one honoured with the authority of God, which he is
to exercise over the clergy, and by which he is to govern all the
people. But let the deacon minister to him, as Christ does to His
Father; <span id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725.md) and let him serve him
unblameably in all things, as Christ does nothing of Himself, but does
always those things that please His Father. Let also the deaconess be
honoured by you in the place of the Holy Ghost, and not do or say
anything without the deacon; as neither does the Comforter say or do
anything of Himself, but gives glory to Christ by waiting for His
pleasure. And as we cannot believe on Christ without the teaching of the
Spirit, so let not any woman address herself to the deacon or bishop
without the deaconess. Let the presbyters be esteemed by you to
represent us the apostles, and let them be the teachers of divine
knowledge; since our Lord, when He sent us, said, “Go ye, and make
disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you.” <span
id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726.md) Let the widows and orphans be
esteemed as representing the altar of burnt-offering; and let the
virgins be honoured as representing the altar of incense, and the
incense itself.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p22.2"></span>That It is a Horrible Thing for a Man to Thrust Himself into Any Sacerdotal Office, as Did Corah and His Company, Saul and Uzziah.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p23"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p23.1"></span>XXVII</span>. As, therefore, it was not
lawful for one of another tribe, that was not a Levite, to offer
anything, or to approach the altar without the priest, so also do you do
nothing without the bishop; <span id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727.md)
for if any one does anything without the bishop, he does it to no
purpose. For it will not be esteemed as of any avail to him. For as
<span id="ix.iii.iv-p24.2"></span>Saul, when he had offered without
<span id="ix.iii.iv-p24.3"></span>Samuel, was told, “It will not avail
for thee;” <span id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728.md) so every person
among the laity, doing anything without the priest, labours in vain. And
as <span id="ix.iii.iv-p25.2"></span>Uzziah the king, <span
id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729.md) who was not a priest, and yet would
exercise the functions of the priests, was smitten with leprosy for his
transgression; so every lay person shall not be unpunished who despises
God, and is so mad as to affront His priests, and unjustly to snatch
that honour to himself: not imitating Christ, “who glorified not Himself
to be made an high priest;” <span id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730.md)
but waited till He heard from His Father, “The Lord sware, and will not
repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p27.2"></span>Melchizedek.” <span
id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731.md) If, therefore, Christ did not
glorify Himself without the Father, how dare any man thrust himself into
the priesthood who has not received that dignity from his superior, and
do such things which it is lawful only for the priests to do? Were not
the followers of <span id="ix.iii.iv-p28.2"></span>Corah, even though
they were of the tribe of <span id="ix.iii.iv-p28.3"></span>Levi,
consumed with fire, because they rose up against <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p28.4"></span>Moses and <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p28.5"></span>Aaron, and meddled with such things as did
not belong to them? And <span id="ix.iii.iv-p28.6"></span>Dathan and
<span id="ix.iii.iv-p28.7"></span>Abiram went down quick into hell; and
the rod that budded put a stop to the readiness of the multitude, and
demonstrated who was the high priest ordained by God. <span
id="fr_2732"></span>[2733](#fn_2732.md) You ought therefore, brethren, to
bring your sacrifices and your oblations to the bishop, as to your high
priest, either by yourselves or by the deacons; and do you bring not
those only, but also your first-fruits, and your tithes, and your
free-will offerings to him. For he knows who they are that are in
affliction, and gives to every one as is convenient, <span
id="page_411">p. 411</span> <span id="ix.iii.iv-Page_411"></span>that so
one may not receive alms twice or oftener the same day, or the same
week, while another has nothing at all. For it is reasonable rather to
supply the wants of those who really are in distress, than of those who
only appear to be so.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p29.2"></span>Of an Entertainment, and After What Manner Each Distinct Order of the Clergy is to Be Treated by Those Who Invite Them to It.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p30"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p30.1"></span>XXVIII</span>. If any determine to invite
elder women to an entertainment of love, or a feast, as our Saviour
calls it, <span id="fr_2733"></span>[2734](#fn_2733.md) let them most
frequently send to such a one whom the deacons know to be in distress.
But let what is the pastor’s due, I mean the first-fruits, <span
id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734.md) be set apart in the feast for him,
even though he be not at the entertainment, as being your priest, and in
honour of that God who has entrusted him with the priesthood. But as
much as is given to every one of the elder women, let double so much be
given to the deacons, in honour of Christ. Let also a double portion be
set apart for the presbyters, as for such who labour continually about
the word and doctrine, upon the account of the apostles of our Lord,
whose place they sustain, as the counsellors of the bishop and the crown
of the Church. For they are the Sanhedrim and senate of the Church. If
there be a reader there, let him receive a single portion, in honour of
the prophets, and let the singer and the porter have as much. Let the
laity, therefore, pay proper honours in their presents, and utmost marks
of respect to each distinct order. But let them not on all occasions
trouble their governor, but let them signify their desires by those who
minister to him, that is, by the deacons, with whom they may be more
free. For neither may we address ourselves to Almighty God, but only by
Christ. In the same manner, therefore, let the laity make known all
their desires to the bishop by the deacon, and accordingly let them act
as he shall direct them. For there was no holy thing offered or done in
the temple formerly without the priest. “For the priest’s lips shall
keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth,” as the
prophet somewhere says, “for he is the messenger of the Lord
Almighty.” <span id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735.md) For if the
worshippers of demons, in their hateful, abominable, and impure
performances, imitate the sacred rules till this very day (it is a wide
comparison indeed, and there is a vast distance between their
abominations and God’s sacred worship), in their mockeries of worship
they neither offer nor do anything without their pretended priest, but
esteem him as the very mouth of their idols of stone, waiting to see
what commands he will lay upon them. And whatsoever he commands them,
that they do, and without him they do nothing; and they honour him,
their pretended priest, and esteem his name as venerable in honour of
lifeless statues, and in order to the worship of wicked spirits. If
these heathens, therefore, who give glory to lying vanities, and place
their hope upon nothing that is firm, endeavour to imitate the sacred
rules, how much more reasonable is it that you, who have a most certain
faith and undoubted hope, and who expect glorious, and eternal, and
never-failing promises, should honour the Lord God in those set over
you, and esteem your bishop to be the mouth of God!  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p33.2"></span>What is the Dignity of a Bishop and of a Deacon.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p34"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p34.1"></span>XXIX</span>. For if <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p34.2"></span>Aaron, because he declared to <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p34.3"></span>Pharaoh the words of God from <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p34.4"></span>Moses, is called a prophet; and <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p34.5"></span>Moses himself is called a god to <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p34.6"></span>Pharaoh, on account of his being at once a
king and a high priest, as God says to him, “I have made thee a god to
<span id="ix.iii.iv-p34.7"></span>Pharaoh, and <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p34.8"></span>Aaron thy brother shall be thy
prophet;” <span id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736.md) why do not ye also
esteem the mediators of the word to be prophets, and reverence them as
gods?  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p35.2"></span>After What Manner the Laity are to Be Obedient to the Deacon.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p36"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p36.1"></span>XXX</span>. For now the deacon is to you
<span id="ix.iii.iv-p36.2"></span>Aaron, and the bishop <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p36.3"></span>Moses. If, therefore, <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p36.4"></span>Moses was called a god by the Lord, let the
bishop be honoured among you as a god, and the deacon as his prophet.
For as Christ does nothing without His Father, so neither does the
deacon do anything without his bishop; and as the Son without His Father
is nothing, so is the deacon nothing without his bishop; and as the Son
is subject to His Father, so is every deacon subject to his bishop; and
as the Son is the messenger and prophet of the Father, so is the deacon
the messenger and prophet of his bishop. Wherefore let all things that
he is to do with any one be made known to the bishop, and be finally
ordered by him.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p36.5"></span>That the Deacon Must Not Do Anything Without the Bishop.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p37"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p37.1"></span>XXXI</span>. Let him not do anything at all
without his bishop, nor give anything without his consent. For if he
gives to any one as to a person in distress without the bishop’s
knowledge, he gives it so that it must tend to the reproach of the
bishop, and he accuses him as careless of the distressed. But he that
casts reproach on his bishop, either by word or deed, opposes God, not
hearkening to what He says: “Thou shalt not speak evil of the
gods.” <span id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737.md) For He did not make
that law concerning deities of wood and <span id="page_412">p.
412</span> <span id="ix.iii.iv-Page_412"></span>of stone, which are
abominable, because they are falsely called gods, but concerning the
priests and the judges, to whom He also said, “Ye are gods, and children
of the Most High.” <span id="fr_2738"></span>[2739](#fn_2738.md)  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p39.2"></span>That the Deacon Must Not Make Any Distributions Without the Consent of the Bishop, Because that Will Turn to the Reproach of the Bishop.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p40"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p40.1"></span>XXXII</span>. If therefore, O deacon, thou
knowest any one to be in distress, put the bishop in mind of him, and so
give to him; but do nothing in a clandestine way, so as may tend to his
reproach, lest thou raise a murmur against him; for the murmur will not
be against him, but against the Lord God: and the deacon, with the rest,
will hear what <span id="ix.iii.iv-p40.2"></span>Aaron and <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p40.3"></span>Miriam heard, when they spake against <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p40.4"></span>Moses: “How is it that ye were not afraid to
speak against my servant <span id="ix.iii.iv-p40.5"></span>Moses?” <span
id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739.md) And again, <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p41.2"></span>Moses says to those who rose up against him:
“Your murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord our God.” <span
id="fr_2740"></span>[2741](#fn_2740.md) For if he that calls one of the
laity Raka, <span id="fr_2741"></span>[2742](#fn_2741.md) or fool, shall
not be unpunished, as doing injury to the name <span
id="fr_2742"></span>[2743](#fn_2742.md) of Christ, how dare any man speak
against his bishop, by whom the Lord gave the Holy Spirit among you upon
the laying on of his hands, by whom ye have learned the sacred
doctrines, and have known God, and have believed in Christ, by whom ye
were known of God, by whom ye were sealed with the oil of gladness and
the ointment of understanding, by whom ye were declared to be the
children of light, by whom the Lord in your illumination testified by
the imposition of the bishop’s hands, and sent out His sacred voice upon
every one of you, saying, “Thou art my son, this day have I begotten
thee?” <span id="fr_2743"></span>[2744](#fn_2743.md) By thy bishop, O man,
God adopts thee for His child. Acknowledge, O son, that right hand which
was a mother to thee. Love him who, after God, is become a father to
thee, and honour him.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p45.2"></span>After What Manner the Bishops are to Be Honoured, and to Be Reverenced as Our Spiritual Parents.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p46"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p46.1"></span>XXXIII</span>. For if the divine oracle
says, concerning our parents according to the flesh, “Honour thy father
and thy mother, that it may be well with thee;” <span
id="fr_2744"></span>[2745](#fn_2744.md) and, “He that curseth his father or
his mother, let him die the death;” <span
id="fr_2745"></span>[2746](#fn_2745.md) how much more should the word
exhort you to honour your spiritual parents, and to love them as your
benefactors and ambassadors with God, who have regenerated you by water,
and endued you with the fulness of the Holy Spirit, who have fed you
with the word as with milk, who have nourished you with doctrine, who
have confirmed you by their admonitions, who have imparted to you the
saving body and precious blood of Christ, who have loosed you from your
sins, who have made you partakers of the holy and sacred eucharist, who
have admitted you to be partakers and fellow-heirs of the promise of
God! Reverence these, and honour them with all kinds of honour; for they
have obtained from God the power of life and death, in their judging of
sinners, and condemning them to the death of eternal fire, as also of
loosing returning sinners from their sins, and of restoring them to a
new life.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p48.2"></span>That Priests are to Be Preferred Before Rulers and Kings.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p49"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p49.1"></span>XXXIV</span>. Account these worthy to be
esteemed your rulers and your kings, and bring them tribute as to kings;
for by you they and their families ought to be maintained. As <span
id="ix.iii.iv-p49.2"></span>Samuel made constitutions for the people
concerning a king, <span id="fr_2746"></span>[2747](#fn_2746.md) in the
first book of Kings, and <span id="ix.iii.iv-p50.2"></span>Moses did so
concerning priests in Leviticus, so do we also make constitutions for
you concerning bishops. For if there the multitude distributed the
inferior services in proportion to so great a king, ought not therefore
the bishop much more now to receive of you those things which are
determined by God for the sustenance of himself and of the rest of the
clergy belonging to him? But if we may add somewhat further, let the
bishop receive more than the other received of old: for he only managed
the affairs of the soldiery, being entrusted with war and peace for the
preservation of men’s bodies; but the other is entrusted with the
exercise of the priestly office in relation to God, in order to preserve
both body and soul from dangers. By how much, therefore, the soul is
more valuable than the body, so much the priestly office is beyond the
kingly. For it binds and looses those that are worthy of punishment or
of remission. Wherefore you ought to love the bishop as your father, and
fear him as your king, and honour him as your lord, bringing to him your
fruits and the works of your hands, for a blessing upon you, giving to
him your first-fruits, and your tithes, and your oblations, and your
gifts, as to the priest of God; the first-fruits of your wheat, and
wine, and oil, and autumnal fruits, and wool, <span
id="fr_2747"></span>[2748](#fn_2747.md) and all things which the Lord God
gives thee. And thy offering shall be accepted as a savour of a sweet
smell to the Lord thy God; and the Lord will bless the works of thy
hands, and will multiply <span id="page_413">p. 413</span> <span
id="ix.iii.iv-Page_413"></span>the good things of the land. “For a
blessing is upon the head of him that giveth.” <span
id="fr_2748"></span>[2749](#fn_2748.md)  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p52.2"></span>That Both the Law and the Gospel Prescribe Offerings.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p53"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p53.1"></span>XXXV</span>. Now you ought to know, that
although the Lord has delivered you from the additional bonds, and has
brought you out of them to your refreshment, and does not permit you to
sacrifice irrational creatures for sin-offerings, and purifications, and
scapegoats, and continual washings and sprinklings, yet has He nowhere
freed you from those oblations which you owe to the priests, nor from
doing good to the poor. For the Lord says to you in the Gospel: “Unless
your righteousness abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees,
ye shall by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_2749"></span>[2750](#fn_2749.md) Now herein will your righteousness
exceed theirs, if you take greater care of the priests, the orphans, and
the widows; as it is written: “He hath scattered abroad; he hath given
to the poor; his righteousness remaineth for ever.” <span
id="fr_2750"></span>[2751](#fn_2750.md) And again: “By acts of
righteousness and faith iniquities are purged.” <span
id="fr_2751"></span>[2752](#fn_2751.md) And again: “Every bountiful soul is
blessed.” <span id="fr_2752"></span>[2753](#fn_2752.md) So therefore shalt
thou do as the Lord has appointed, and shalt give to the priest what
things are due to him, the first-fruits of thy floor, and of thy
wine-press, and sin-offerings, as to the mediator between God and such
as stand in need of purgation and forgiveness. For it is thy duty to
give, and his to administer, as being the administrator and disposer of
ecclesiastical affairs. Yet shalt thou not call thy bishop to account,
nor watch his administration, how he does it, when, or to whom, or
where, or whether he do it well or ill, or indifferently; for he has One
who will call him to an account, the Lord God, who put this
administration into his hands, and thought him worthy of the priesthood
of so great dignity.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.iv-p57.2"></span>The Recital of the Ten Commandments, and After What Manner They Do Here Prescribe to Us.

<span id="ix.iii.iv-p58"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.iv-p58.1"></span>XXXVI</span>. Have before thine eyes the
fear of God, and always remember the ten commandments of God,—to love
the one and only Lord God with all thy strength; to give no heed to
idols, or any other beings, as being lifeless gods, or irrational beings
or dæmons. Consider the manifold workmanship of God, which received its
beginning through Christ. Thou shalt observe the Sabbath, on account of
Him who ceased from His work of creation, but ceased not from His work
of providence: it is a rest for meditation of the law, not for idleness
of the hands. Reject every unlawful lust, everything destructive to men,
and all anger. Honour thy parents, as the authors of thy being. Love thy
neighbour as thyself. Communicate the necessaries of life to the needy.
Avoid swearing falsely, and swearing often, and in vain; for thou shalt
not be held guiltless. Do not appear before the priests empty, and offer
thy free-will offerings continually. Moreover, do not leave the church
of Christ; but go thither in the morning before all thy work, and again
meet there in the evening, to return thanks to God that He has preserved
thy life. Be diligent, and constant, and laborious in thy calling. Offer
to the Lord thy free-will offerings; for says He, “Honour the Lord with
the fruit of thy honest labours.” <span
id="fr_2753"></span>[2754](#fn_2753.md) If thou art not able to cast
anything considerable into the Corban, <span
id="fr_2754"></span>[2755](#fn_2754.md) yet at least bestow upon the
strangers one, or two, or five mites. “Lay up to thyself heavenly
treasure, which neither the moth nor thieves can destroy.” <span
id="fr_2755"></span>[2756](#fn_2755.md) And in doing this, do not judge thy
bishop, or any of thy neighbours among the laity; for if thou judge thy
brother, thou becomest a judge, without being constituted such by
anybody, for the priests are only entrusted with the power of judging.
For to them it is said, “Judge righteous judgment;” <span
id="fr_2756"></span>[2757](#fn_2756.md) and again “Approve yourselves to be
exact money-changers.” <span id="fr_2757"></span>[2758](#fn_2757.md) For to
you this is not entrusted; for, on the contrary, it is said to those who
are not of the dignity of magistrates or ministers: “Judge not, and ye
shall not be judged.” <span id="fr_2758"></span>[2759](#fn_2758.md)
