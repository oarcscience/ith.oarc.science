<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.vi-p1"></A><a name="iii.v.vi-p1.1"></A>Aurelian might have recollected the fate of the captived emperor, yet, being of a nature outrageous and headstrong, he forgot both <span><a name="iii.v.vi-p1.2"></A>his</span> sin and its punishment, and by deeds of cruelty irritated the divine wrath. He was not, however, permitted to accomplish what he had devised; for just as he began to give a loose to his rage, he was slain. His bloody edicts had not yet reached the more distant provinces, when he himself lay all bloody on the earth at C&aelig;nophrurium in Thrace, assassinated by his familiar friends, who had taken up groundless suspicions against him. &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.vi-p2"></A>Examples of such a nature, and so numerous, ought to have deterred succeeding tyrants; nevertheless they were not only not dismayed, but, in their misdeeds against God, became more bold and presumptuous. &#160;</p>
