#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.xv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XV.—Of the Affections, and the Opinion of the Peripatetics Respecting Them.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xv-p1"></span>For, that these things are natural and
not voluntary, the nature of all living beings shows, which is moved by
all these affections. Therefore the Peripatetics act better, who say
that all these cannot be taken from us, because they were born with us;
and they endeavour to show how providently and how necessarily God, or
nature (for so they term it), armed us with these affections; which,
however, because they generally become vicious if they are in excess,
can be advantageously regulated by man,—a limit being applied, so that
there may be left to man as much as is sufficient for nature. Not an
unwise disputation, if, as I said, all things were not referred to this
life. The Stoics therefore are mad who do not regulate but cut them out,
and wish by some means or other to deprive man of powers implanted in
him by nature. And this is equivalent to a desire of taking away
timidity from stags, or poison from serpents, or <span id="page_180">p.
180</span> <span id="iii.ii.vi.xv-Page_180"></span>rage from wild
beasts, or gentleness from cattle. For those qualities which have been
given separately to dumb animals, are altogether given to man at the
same time. But if, as physicians affirm, the affection of joy has its
seat in the spleen, <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md) that of
anger in the gall, of desire in the liver, of fear in the heart, it is
easier to kill the animal itself than to tear anything from the body;
for this is to wish to change the nature of the living creature. But the
skilful men do not understand that when they take away vices from man,
they also take away virtue, for which alone they are making a place. For
if it is virtue in the midst of the impetuosity of anger to restrain and
check oneself, which they cannot deny, then he who is without anger is
also without virtue. If it is virtue to control the lust of the body, he
must be free from virtue who has no lust which he may regulate. If it is
virtue to curb the desire from coveting that which belongs to another,
he certainly can have no virtue who is without that, to the restraining
of which the exercise of virtue is applied. Where, therefore, there are
no vices, there is no place even for virtue, as there is no place for
victory where there is no adversary. And so it comes to pass that there
can be no good in this life without evil. An affection therefore is a
kind of natural fruitfulness <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md)
of the powers of the mind. For as a field which is naturally fruitful
produces an abundant crop of briars, <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md) so the mind which is uncultivated
is overgrown with vices flourishing of their own accord, as with thorns.
But when the true cultivator has applied himself, immediately vices give
way, and the fruits of virtues spring up.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xv-p5"></span>Therefore God, when He first made man,
with wonderful foresight first implanted in him these emotions of the
mind, that he might be capable of receiving virtue, as the earth is of
cultivation; and He placed the subject-matter of vices in the
affections, and that of virtue in vices. For assuredly virtue will have
no existence, or not be in exercise, if those things are wanting by
which its power is either shown or exists. Now let us see what they have
effected who altogether removes vices. With regard to those four
affections <span id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md) which they imagine
to arise from the opinion of things good and evil, by the eradication of
which they think that the mind of the wise man is to be healed, since
they understand that they are implanted by nature, and that without
these nothing can be put in motion, nothing be done, they put certain
other things into their place and room: for desire they substitute
inclination, as though it were not much better to desire a good than to
feel inclination for it; they in like manner substitute for joy
gladness, and for fear caution. But in the case of the fourth they are
at a loss for a method of exchanging the name. Therefore they have
altogether taken away grief, that is, sadness and pain of mind, which
cannot possibly be done. For who can fail to be grieved if pestilence
has desolated his country, or an enemy overthrown it, or a tyrant
crushed its liberty? Can any one fail to be grieved if he has beheld the
overthrow of liberty, <span id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) and the
banishment or most cruel slaughter of neighbours, friends, or good
men?—unless the mind of any one should be so struck with astonishment
that all sensibility should be taken from him. Wherefore they ought
either to have taken away the whole, or this defective <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) and weak discussion ought to have
been completed; that is, something ought to have been substituted in the
place of grief, since, the former ones having been so arranged, this
naturally followed.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xv-p9"></span>For as we rejoice in good things that
are present, so we are vexed and grieved with evil things. If,
therefore, they gave another name to joy because they thought it
vicious, so it was befitting that another name should be given to grief
because they thought it also vicious. From which it appears that it was
not the object itself which was wanting to them, but a word, through
want of which they wished, contrary to what nature allowed, to take away
that affection which is the greatest. For I could have refuted those
changes of names at greater length, and have shown that many names are
attached to the same objects, for the sake of embellishing the style and
increasing its copiousness, or at any rate that they do not greatly
differ from one another. For both desire takes its beginning from the
inclination, and caution arises from fear, and joy is nothing else than
the expression of gladness. But let us suppose that they are different,
as they themselves will have it. Accordingly they will say that desire
is continued and perpetual inclination, but that joy is gladness bearing
itself immoderately; and that fear is caution in excess, and passing the
limits of moderation. Thus it comes to pass, that they do not take away
those things which they think ought to be taken away, but regulate them,
since the names only are changed, the things themselves remain. They
therefore return unawares to that point at which the Peripatetics arrive
by argument, that vices, since they cannot be taken away, are to be
regulated with moderation. Therefore they err, because they do not
succeed in effecting that which they aim at, and by a circuitous route,
which is long and rough, they return to the same path. <span
