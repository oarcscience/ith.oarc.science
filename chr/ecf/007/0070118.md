<span id="iii.ii.v.v"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chap. V.—There Was True Justice Under Saturnus, But It Was Banished by Jupiter.

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p1"></span>Now the promised disputation concerning
justice must be given; which is either by itself the greatest virtue, or
by itself the fountain of virtue, which not only philosophers sought,
but poets also, who were much earlier, and were esteemed as wise before
the origin of the name of philosophy. These clearly understood that this
justice was absent from the affairs of men; and they feigned that it,
being offended with the vices of men, departed from the earth, and
withdrew to heaven; and that they may teach what it is to live justly
(for they are accustomed to give precepts by circumlocutions), they
repeat examples of justice from the times of <span
id="iii.ii.v.v-p1.1"></span>Saturnus, which they call the golden times,
and they relate in what condition human life was while it delayed on the
earth. <span id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md) And this is not to be
regarded as a poetic fiction, but as the truth. For, while <span
id="iii.ii.v.v-p2.3"></span>Saturnus reigned, the religious worship of
the gods not having yet been instituted, nor any <span
id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958.md) race being as yet set apart in the
belief of its divinity, God was manifestly worshipped. And therefore
there were neither dissensions, nor enmities, nor wars.  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p3.4"></span> “Not yet had rage unsheathed
> maddened swords,”  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p4"></span>as <span
id="iii.ii.v.v-p4.1"></span>Germanicus Cæsar speaks in his poem
translated from <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p4.2"></span>Aratus, <span
id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959.md)  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p5.5"></span> “Nor had discord been known among
> relatives.”  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p6"></span>No, nor even among strangers: but there
were no swords at all to be unsheathed. For who, when justice was
present and in vigour, would think respecting his own protection, since
no one plotted against him; or respecting the destruction of another,
since no one desired anything?  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p6.1"></span> “They preferred to live content
> with a simple mode of life,”  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p7"></span>as <span
id="iii.ii.v.v-p7.1"></span>Cicero <span
id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md) relates in his poem; and this is
peculiar to our religion. “It was not even allowed to mark out or to
divide the plain with a boundary: men sought all things in
common;” <span id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) since God <span
id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-Page_141"></span>had
given the earth in common to all, that they might pass their life in
common, not that mad and raging avarice might claim all things for
itself, and that that which was produced for all might not be wanting to
any. And this saying of the poet ought so to be taken, not as suggesting
the idea that individuals at that time had no private property, but it
must be regarded as a poetical figure; that we may understand that men
were so liberal, that they did not shut up the fruits of the earth
produced for them, nor did they in solitude brood over the things stored
up, but admitted the poor to share the fruits of their labour:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p9.3"></span> “Now streams of milk, now streams
> of nectar flowed.” <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p11"></span>And no wonder, since the storehouses of
the good liberally lay open to all. Nor did avarice intercept the divine
bounty, and thus cause hunger and thirst in common; but all alike had
abundance, since they who had possessions gave liberally and bountifully
to those who had not. But after that <span
id="iii.ii.v.v-p11.1"></span>Saturnus had been banished from heaven, and
had arrived in Latium,—  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p11.2"></span> “Exiled from his throne  
> By <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p11.5"></span>Jove, his mightier heir,” <span
> id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) —  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p13"></span>since the people either through fear of
the new king, or of their own accord, had become corrupted and ceased to
worship God, and had begun to esteem the king in the place of God, since
he himself, almost a parricide, was an example to others to the injury
of piety,—  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p13.1"></span> “The most just Virgin in haste
> deserted the lands;” <span id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p15"></span>but not as <span
id="iii.ii.v.v-p15.1"></span>Cicero says, <span
id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md)  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p16.2"></span> “And settled, in the kingdom of
> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p16.4"></span>Jupiter, <span
> id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md)  <span
> id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md) and in a part of the heaven.”  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p18"></span>For how could she settle or tarry in
the kingdom of him who expelled his father from his kingdom, harassed
him with war, and drove him as an exile over the whole world?  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p18.1"></span> “He gave to the black serpents
> their noxious poison,  
> And ordered wolves to prowl;” <span
> id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p20"></span>that is, he introduced among men
hatred, and envy, and stratagem; so that they were poisonous as
serpents, and rapacious as wolves. And they truly do this who persecute
those who are righteous and faithful towards God, and give to judges the
power of using violence against the innocent. Perhaps <span
id="iii.ii.v.v-p20.1"></span>Jupiter may have done something of this
kind for the overthrow and removal of righteousness; and on this account
he is related to have made serpents fierce, and to have whetted the
spirit of wolves.  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.v-p20.2"></span> “Then war’s indomitable rage,  
> And greedy lust of gain;” <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.v-p22"></span>and not without reason. For the worship
of God being taken away, men lost the knowledge of good and evil. Thus
the common intercourse of life perished from among then, and the bond of
human society was destroyed. Then they began to contend with one
another, and to plot, and to acquire for themselves glory from the
shedding of human blood.
