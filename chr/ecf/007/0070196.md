#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chap. III.—The Testimonies of the Poets Concerning the One God.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.iv-p1"></span>There is, then, one God, perfect,
eternal, incorruptible, incapable of suffering, subject to no
circumstance or power, Himself possessing all things, ruling all things,
whom the human mind can neither estimate in thought nor mortal tongue
describe in speech. For He is too elevated and great to be conceived by
the thought, or expressed by the language of man. In short, not to speak
of the prophets, the preachers of the one God, poets also, and
philosophers, and inspired women, <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452) utter their testimony to the unity
of God. <span id="iii.ii.viii.iv-p2.3"></span>Orpheus speaks of the
surpassing God who made the heaven and the sun, with the other heavenly
bodies; who made the earth and the seas. Also our own <span
id="iii.ii.viii.iv-p2.4"></span>Maro calls the Supreme God at one time a
spirit, at another time a mind, and says that it, as though infused into
limbs, puts in motion the body of the whole world; also, that God
permeates the heights of heaven, the tracts of the sea and lands, and
that all living creatures derive their life from Him. Even <span
id="iii.ii.viii.iv-p2.5"></span>Ovid was not ignorant that the world was
prepared by God, whom he sometimes calls the framer of all things,
sometimes the fabricator of the world. <span
