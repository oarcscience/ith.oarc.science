#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.i-p0.1"></span>Chap. I.—Of the Worship of the True God, and of Innocency, and of the Worship of False Gods.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii.vi.i-p1.1"></span>We</span> have completed that which was the
object of our undertaking, through the teaching of the Divine Spirit,
and the aid of the truth itself; the cause of asserting and explaining
which was imposed upon me both by conscience and faith, and by our Lord
Himself, without whom nothing can be known or clearly set forth. I come
now to that which is the chief and greatest part of this work—to teach
in what manner or by what sacrifice God must be worshipped. For that is
the duty of man, and in that one object the sum of all things and the
whole course of a happy life consists, since we were fashioned and
received the breath of life from Him on this account, not that we might
behold the heaven and the sun, as <span
id="iii.ii.vi.i-p1.2"></span>Anaxagoras supposed, but that we might with
pure and uncorrupted mind worship Him who made the sun and the heaven.
But although in the preceding books, as far as my moderate talent
permitted, I defended the truth, yet it may especially be
elucidated <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) by the mode of
worship itself. For that sacred and surpassing majesty requires from man
nothing more than innocence alone; and if any one has presented this to
God, he has sacrificed with sufficient piety and religion. But men,
neglecting justice, though they are polluted by crimes and outrages of
all kinds, think themselves religious if they have stained the temples
and altars with the blood of victims, if they have moistened the hearths
with a profusion of fragrant and old wine. Moreover, they also prepare
sacred feasts and choice banquets, as though they offered to those who
would taste something from them. Whatever is rarely to be viewed,
whatever is precious in workmanship or in fragrance, that they judge to
be pleasing to their gods, not by any reference to their divinity, of
which they are ignorant, but from their own desires; nor do they
understand that God is in no want of earthly resources.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.i-p3"></span>For they have no knowledge of anything
except the earth, and they estimate good and evil things by the
perception and pleasure of the body alone. And as they judge of religion
according to its pleasure, so also they arrange the acts of their whole
life. And since they have turned away once for all from the
contemplation of the heaven, and have made that heavenly faculty the
slave of the body, they give the reins to their lusts, as though they
were about to bear away pleasure with themselves, which they hasten to
enjoy at every moment; whereas the soul ought to employ the service of
the body, and not the body to make use of the service of the soul. The
same men judge riches to be the greatest good. And if they cannot obtain
them by good practices, they endeavour to obtain them by evil practices;
they deceive, they carry off by violence, they plunder, they lie in
wait, they deny on oath; in short, they have no consideration or regard
for anything, <span id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) if only they
can glitter with gold, and shine conspicuous with plate, with jewels,
and with garments, can spend riches upon their greedy appetite, and
always walk attended with crowds of slaves through the people compelled
to give way. <span id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) Thus
devoting <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) themselves to the
service of pleasures, they extinguish the force and vigour of the mind;
and when they especially think that they are alive, they are hastening
with the greatest precipitation to death. For, as we showed in the
second book, the soul is concerned with heaven, the body with the
earth. <span id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) They who neglect the
goods of the soul, and seek those of the body, <span id="page_163">p.
163</span> <span id="iii.ii.vi.i-Page_163"></span>are engaged with
darkness and death, which belong to the earth and to the body, because
life and light are from heaven; and they who are without this, by
serving the body, are far removed from the understanding of divine
things. The same blindness everywhere oppresses the wretched men; for as
they know not who is the true God, so they know not what constitutes
true worship.
