#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXV.—Of the Advent of Jesus in the Flesh and Spirit, that He Might Be Mediator Between God and Man.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p1"></span>Let men therefore learn and
understand why the Most High God, when He sent His ambassador and
messenger to instruct mortals with the precepts of His righteousness,
willed that He should be clothed with mortal flesh, and be afflicted
with torture, and be sentenced to death. For since there was no
righteousness on earth, He sent a teacher, as it were a living law, to
found a new name and temple, <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827)
that by His words and example He might spread throughout the earth a
true and holy worship. But, however, that it might be certain that He
was sent by God, it was befitting that He should not be born as man is
born, composed of a mortal on both sides; <span
id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828) but that it might appear that He was
heavenly even in the form of man, He was born without the office of a
father. For He had a spiritual Father, God; and as God was the Father of
His spirit without a mother, so a virgin was the mother of His body
without a father. He was therefore both God and man, being placed in the
middle between God and man. From which the Greeks call Him
Mesites, <span id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829) that He might be able
to lead man to God—that is, to immortality: for if He had been God only
(as we have before said), He would not have been able to afford to man
examples of goodness; if He had been man only, He would not have been
able to compel men to righteousness, unless there had been added an
authority and virtue greater than that of man.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p5"></span>For, since man is composed of flesh
and <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-Page_127"></span>spirit, and the spirit must
earn <span id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830) immortality by works of
righteousness, the flesh, since it is earthly, and therefore mortal,
draws with itself the spirit linked to it, and leads it from immortality
to death. Therefore the spirit, apart from the flesh, could by no means
be a guide to immortality for man, since the flesh hinders the spirit
from following God. For it is frail, and liable to sin; but sin is the
food and nourishment <span id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831) of death.
For this cause, therefore, a mediator came—that is, God in the
flesh—that the flesh might be able to follow Him, and that He might
rescue man from death, which has dominion over the flesh. Therefore He
clothed Himself with flesh, that the desires of the flesh being subdued,
He might teach that to sin was not the result of necessity, but of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p7.2"></span>man’s purpose and will. For we have one
great and principal struggle to maintain with the flesh, the boundless
desires of which press upon the soul, nor allow it to retain dominion,
but make it the slave of pleasures and sweet allurements, and visit it
with everlasting death. And that we might be able to overcome these, God
has opened and displayed to us the way of overcoming the flesh. And this
perfect and absolutely complete <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832)
virtue bestows on those who conquer, the crown and reward of
immortality.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p2"></span> Thus, [Heb. viii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002)<span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p2.1"></span>, Christ is spoken of as “a minister of
the sanctuary, and the true tabernacle.”

id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p4.3"></span>της</span>, a mediator, one who stands
between two parties to bring them together. Thus [1 Tim. ii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)<span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p4.4"></span>, “There is one God, and one mediator
(<span class="Greek"><span

id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p4.6"></span>́</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p4.7"></span>της</span>) between God and men, the man
Christ <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p4.8"></span>Jesus.” In the Epistle to
the Hebrews Christ is spoken of as the “mediator of the new covenant.”
And [Gal. iii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020)<span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxv-p4.9"></span>, “A mediator is not of one:” the very
idea of a mediator implies that he stands between two parties as a
reconciler.
