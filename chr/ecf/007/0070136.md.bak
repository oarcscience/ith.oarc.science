#### <span id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIII.—Of the Justice and Patience of the Christians.

<span id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-p1"></span>It would be a lengthened task to
draw forth all the appearances of virtue, to show respecting each how
necessary it is for a wise and just man to be far removed from those
goods, the enjoyment of which by the unjust causes the worship of their
gods to be regarded as true and efficacious. As our present inquiry is
concerned, it will be sufficient to prove our point from the case of a
single virtue. For instance, patience is a great and leading virtue,
which the public voices of the people and philosophers and orators alike
extol with the highest praises. But if it cannot be denied that this is
a virtue of the highest kind, it is necessary that the just and wise man
should be in the power of the unjust, for obtaining patience; for
patience is the bearing with equanimity of the evils which are either
inflicted or happen to fall upon us. Therefore the just and wise man,
because he exercises virtue, has patience in himself; but he will be
altogether free from this if he shall suffer no adversity. On the other
hand, the man who lives in prosperity is impatient, and is without the
greatest virtue. I call him impatient, because he suffers nothing. He is
also unable to preserve innocency, which virtue is peculiar to the just
and wise man. But he often acts unjustly also, and desires the property
of others, and seizes upon that which he has desired by injustice,
because he is without virtue, and is subject to vice and sin; and
forgetful of his frailty, he is puffed up with a mind elated with
insolence.  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-p2"></span>From this cause the unjust, and
those who are ignorant of God, abound with riches, and power, and
honours. For all these things are the rewards of injustice, because they
cannot be perpetual, and they are sought through lust and violence. But
the just and wise man, because he deems all these things as human, as it
has been said by <span id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Lælius, and his
own goods as divine, <span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-Page_160"></span>neither desires anything which
belongs to another, lest he should injure any one at all in violation of
the law of humanity; nor does he long for any power or honour, that he
may not do an injury to any one. For he knows that all are produced by
the same God, and in the same condition, and are joined together by the
right of brotherhood. <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) But
being contented with his own, and <span
id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-p3.2"></span>that a little, because he is mindful of
his frailty, he does not seek for anything beyond that which may support
his life; and even from that which he has he bestows a share on the
destitute, because he is pious; but piety is a very great virtue. To
this is added, that he despises frail and vicious pleasures, for the
sake of which riches are desired; since he is temperate, and master of
his passions. He also, having no pride or insolence, does not raise
himself too highly, nor lift up his head with arrogance; but he is calm
and peaceful, lowly <span id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) and
courteous, because he knows his own condition. Since, therefore, he does
injury to none, nor desires the property of others, and does not even
defend his own if it is taken from him by violence, since he knows how
even to bear with moderation an injury inflicted upon him, because he is
endued with virtue; it is necessary that the just man should be subject
to the unjust, and that the wise should be insulted by the foolish, that
the one may sin because he is unjust, and the other may have virtue in
himself because he is just.  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-p5"></span>But if any one shall wish to know
more fully why God permits the wicked and the unjust to become powerful,
happy, and rich, and, on the other hand, suffers the pious to be humble,
wretched, and poor, let him take the book of <span
id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-p5.1"></span>Seneca which has the title, “Why many
evils happen to good men, though there is a providence;” in which book
he has said many things, not assuredly with the ignorance of this world,
but wisely, and almost with divine inspiration. <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) “God,” he says, “regards men as His
children, but He permits the corrupt and vicious to live in luxury and
delicacy, because He does not think them worthy of His correction. But
He often chastises the good whom He loves, and by continual labours
exercises them to the practice of virtue: nor does He permit them to be
corrupted and depraved by frail and perishable goods.” From which it
ought to appear strange to no one if we are often chastised by God for
our faults. Yea, rather, when we are harassed and pressed, then we
especially give thanks to our most indulgent Father, because He does not
permit our corruption to proceed to greater lengths, but corrects it
with stripes and blows. From which we understand that we are an object
of regard to God, since He is angry when we sin. For when He might have
bestowed upon His people both riches and kingdoms, as He had before
given them to the Jews, whose successors and posterity we are; on this
account He would have them live under the power and government of
others, lest, being corrupted by the happiness of prosperity, they
should glide into luxury and despise the precepts of God; as those
ancestors of ours, who, ofttimes enervated by these earthly and frail
goods, departed from discipline and burst the bonds of the law.
Therefore He foresaw how far He would afford rest to His worshippers if
they should keep His commandments, and yet correct them if they did not
obey His precepts. Therefore, lest they should be as much corrupted by
ease as their fathers had been by indulgence, <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) it was His will that they should be
oppressed by those in whose power He placed them, that He may both
confirm them when wavering, and renew them to fortitude when corrupted,
and try and prove them when faithful. For how can a general prove the
valour of his soldiers, unless he shall have an enemy? And yet there
arises an adversary to him against his will, because he is mortal, and
is able to be conquered; but because God cannot be opposed, He Himself
stirs up adversaries to His name, not to fight against God Himself, but
against His soldiers, that He may either prove the devotedness and
fidelity of His servants, or may strengthen them, until He corrects
their wasting discipline by the stripes of affliction. <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-p9"></span>There is also another cause why He
permits persecutions to be carried on against us, that the people of God
may be increased. <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) Nor is it
difficult to show why or how this happens. First of all, great numbers
are driven from the worship of the false gods by their hatred of
cruelty. For who would not shrink from such sacrifices? In the next
place, some are pleased with virtue and faith itself. Some suspect that
it is not without reason that the worship of the gods is considered evil
by so many men, so that they would rather die than do that which others
do that they may preserve their life. Some one desires to know what that
good is which is defended even to death, which is preferred to all
things which are pleasant and beloved in this life, from which neither
the loss of goods, nor of the light, nor bodily pain, nor tortures of
the vitals deter them. These things have great effect; but these causes
have always especially increased <span id="page_161">p. 161</span> <span
id="iii.ii.v.xxiii-Page_161"></span>the number of our followers. The
people who stand around hear them saying in the midst of these very
torments that they do not sacrifice to stones wrought by the hand of
man, but to the living God, who is in heaven: many understand that this
is true, and admit it into their breast. In the next place, as it is
accustomed to happen in matters of uncertainty while they make inquiry
of one another, what is the cause of this perseverance, many things
which relate to religion, being spread abroad and carefully observed by
rumour among one another, are learned; and because these are good they
cannot fail to please. Moreover, the revenge which follows, as always
happens, greatly impels men to believe. Nor, indeed, is it a slight
cause that the unclean spirits of demons, having received permission,
throw themselves into the bodies of many; and when these have afterwards
been driven out, they who have been healed cling to the religion, the
power of which they have experienced. These numerous causes being
collected together, wonderfully gain over a great multitude to
God. <span id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md)
