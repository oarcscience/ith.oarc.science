#### <span id="iii.v.xl-p0.1"></span>Chap. XL.

<span id="iii.v.xl-p1"></span>There was a certain matron of high rank
who already had grandchildren by more than one son. Her <span
id="iii.v.xl-p1.1"></span>Valeria loved like a second mother, and <span
id="iii.v.xl-p1.2"></span>Daia suspected that her advice had produced
that refusal which <span id="iii.v.xl-p1.3"></span>Valeria gave to his
matrimonial offers; and therefore he charged the president <span
id="iii.v.xl-p1.4"></span>Eratineus to have her put to death in a way
that might injure her fame. To her two others, equally noble, were
added. One of them, who had a daughter a Vestal virgin at Rome,
maintained an intercourse by stealth with the banished <span
id="iii.v.xl-p1.5"></span>Valeria. The other, married to a senator, was
intimately connected with the empress. Excellent beauty and virtue
proved the cause of their death. They were dragged to the tribunal, not
of an upright judge, but of a robber. Neither indeed was there any
accuser, until a certain Jew, one charged with other offences, was
induced, through hope of pardon, to give false evidence against the
innocent. The equitable and vigilant magistrate conducted him out of the
city under a guard, lest the populace should have stoned him. This
tragedy was acted at Nicæa. The Jew was ordered to the torture till he
should speak as he had been instructed, while the torturers by blows
prevented the women from speaking in their own defence. The innocent
were condemned to die. Then there arose wailing and lamentation, not
only of the senator, who attended on his well-deserving consort, but
amongst the spectators also, whom this proceeding, scandalous and
unheard of, had brought together; and, to prevent the multitude from
violently rescuing the condemned persons out of the hands of the
executioners, military commanders followed with light infantry and
archers. And thus, under a guard of armed soldiers, they were led to
punishment. Their domestics having been forced to flee, they would have
remained without burial, had not the compassion of friends interred them
by stealth. Nor was the promise of pardon made good to the feigned
adulterer, for he was fixed to a gibbet, and then he disclosed the whole
secret contrivance; and with his last breath he protested to all the
beholders that the women died innocent.
