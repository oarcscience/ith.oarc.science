#### <span id="iii.v.xxxix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXIX.

<span id="iii.v.xxxix-p1"></span>Now <span
id="iii.v.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Daia, in gratifying his libidinous desires,
made his own will the standard of right; and therefore he would not
refrain from soliciting the widow of <span
id="iii.v.xxxix-p1.2"></span>Galerius, the Empress <span
id="iii.v.xxxix-p1.3"></span>Valeria, to whom he had lately given the
appellation of mother. After the death of her husband, she <span
id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span id="iii.v.xxxix-Page_317"></span>had
repaired to <span id="iii.v.xxxix-p1.4"></span>Daia, because she
imagined that she might live with more security in his dominions than
elsewhere, especially as he was a married man; but the flagitious
creature became instantly inflamed with a passion for her. <span
id="iii.v.xxxix-p1.5"></span>Valeria was still in weeds, the time of her
mourning not being yet expired. He sent a message to her proposing
marriage, and offering, on her compliance, to put away his wife. She
frankly returned an answer such as she alone could dare to do: first,
that she would not treat of marriage while she was in weeds, and while
the ashes of <span id="iii.v.xxxix-p1.6"></span>Galerius, <span
id="iii.v.xxxix-p1.7"></span>her husband, and, by adoption, the father
of <span id="iii.v.xxxix-p1.8"></span>Daia, were yet warm; next, that he
acted impiously, in proposing to divorce a faithful wife to make room
for another, whom in her turn he would also cast off; and, lastly, that
it was indecent, unexampled, and unlawful for a woman of her title and
dignity to engage a second time in wedlock. <span
id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md) This bold answer having been
reported to <span id="iii.v.xxxix-p2.1"></span>Daia, presently his
desires changed into rage and furious resentment. He pronounced sentence
of forfeiture against the princess, seized her goods, removed her
attendants, tortured her eunuchs to death, and banished her and her
mother <span id="iii.v.xxxix-p2.2"></span>Prisca: but he appointed no
particular place for her residence while in banishment; and hence he
insultingly expelled her from every abode that she took in the course of
her wanderings; and, to complete all, he condemned the ladies who
enjoyed most of her friendship and confidence to die on a false
accusation of adultery.
