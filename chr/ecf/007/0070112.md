#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXX.—Of Avoiding Heresies and Superstitions, and What is the Only True Catholic Church.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p1"></span>But since many heresies have existed,
and the people of God have been rent into divisions at the instigation
of demons, the truth must be briefly marked out by us, and placed in its
own peculiar dwelling-place, that if any one shall desire to draw the
water of life, he may not be borne to broken cisterns <span
id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897) which hold no water, but may know the
abundant fountain of God, watered by which he may enjoy perpetual light.
Before all things, it is befitting that we should know both that He
Himself and His ambassadors foretold that there must be numerous sects
and heresies, <span id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898) which would break
the unity <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899) of the sacred body;
and that they admonished us to be on our guard with the greatest
prudence, lest we should at any time fall into the snares and deceits of
that adversary of ours, with whom God has willed that we should contend.
Then that He gave us sure commands, which we ought always to treasure in
our minds; for many, forgetting them, and abandoning the heavenly road,
have made for themselves devious paths amidst windings and precipices,
by which they might lead away the incautious and simple part of the
people to the darkness of death: I will explain how this happened. There
were some of our religion whose faith was less established, or who were
less learned or less cautious, who rent the unity and divided the
Church. But they whose faith was unsettled, <span
id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900) when they pretended that they knew and
worshipped God, aiming at the increase of their wealth and honour,
aspired to the highest sacerdotal power; and when overcome by others
more powerful, preferred to secede with their supporters, than to endure
those set over them, over whom they themselves before desired to be
set. <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901)  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p7"></span>But some, not sufficiently instructed
in heavenly learning, when they were unable to reply to the accusers of
the truth, who objected that it was either impossible or inconsistent
that God should be shut up in the womb of a woman, and that the Majesty
of heaven could not be reduced to such weakness as to become an object
of contempt and derision, a reproach and mockery to men; lastly, that He
should even endure tortures, and be affixed to the accursed cross; and
when they could defend and refute all these things neither by talent nor
learning, for they did not thoroughly perceive their force and meaning,
they were perverted <span id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902) from the
right path, and corrupted the sacred writings, so that they composed for
themselves a new doctrine without any root and stability. But some,
enticed by the prediction of false prophets, concerning whom both the
true prophets and he himself had foretold, fell away from the knowledge
of God, and left the true tradition. But all of these, ensnared by
frauds of demons, which they ought to have foreseen and guarded against,
by their carelessness lost the name and worship of God. For when they
are called Phrygians, <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903) or
Novatians, <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904) or
Valentinians, <span id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905) or
Marcionites, <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906) or
Anthropians, <span id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907) or Arians, <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908) or by any other name, they have ceased
to be Christians, who have lost the name of Christ, and assumed human
and external names. Therefore it is the Catholic Church alone which
retains true worship.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p15"></span>This is the fountain of truth, this
is the abode of the faith, this is the temple of God; into which if any
one shall not enter, or from which if any shall go out, he is estranged
from the hope of life and eternal salvation. No one ought to flatter
himself with persevering strife. For the contest is respecting life and
salvation, which, <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-Page_134"></span>unless it is carefully and diligently
kept in view, will be lost and extinguished. But, however, because all
the separate assemblies of heretics call themselves Christians in
preference to others, and think that theirs is the Catholic Church, it
must be known that the true Catholic Church is that in which there is
confession and repentance, <span id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909) which
treats in a wholesome manner the sins and wounds to which the weakness
of the flesh is liable. I have related these things in the meanwhile for
the sake of admonition, that no one who desires to avoid error may be
entangled in a greater error, while he is ignorant of the secret <span
id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910) of the truth. Afterwards, in a
particular and separate work, we will more fully and copiously <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911) contend against all divisions of
falsehoods. It follows that, since we have spoken sufficiently on the
subject of true religion and wisdom, we discuss the subject of justice
in the next book.

#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p19.1"></span>General Notes by the American Editor.

##### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p19.2"></span>I.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p20"></span>(On cap. 29.)  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p21"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p21.1"></span>Here</span> we should look for something
also concerning the Holy Spirit. But our author’s principle is doubtless
a reflection of the prevailing sentiment of the Church at this period,
which was perhaps a violent exaggeration of our Lord’s example ([Mark
iv. 33](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#033)<span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p21.2"></span>). And see something of this on p. 140,
note 6, infra; also [Matt. vii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006)<span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p21.4"></span>.  

##### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p21.5"></span>II.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p22"></span>(On cap. 30.)  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p23"></span>The simplicity with which our author
gives a note of the Catholic Church, in accordance with African canons
and the teaching of <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p23.1"></span>Cyprian, is
very noteworthy. It never occurred to him that communion with any one
particular See was the note. <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p23.2"></span>Hippolytus alone would have reminded him
that the worst heretics had been in communion with both <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p23.3"></span>Zephyrinus and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p23.4"></span>Callistus in his days (see vol. v. pp.
156 and 160; also <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p23.7"></span>Ibid., 125,
130), and that orthodoxy had been persecuted by these bishops of Rome.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p10"></span> The Novatians were the followers of
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p10.1"></span>Novatus, in the third century,
They assumed to themselves the title of Cathari, or the pure. They
refused to re-admit to the ir communion those who had once fallen away,
and allowed no place for repentance.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p11"></span> The Valentinians were the followers
of <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p11.1"></span>Valentinus, an Egyptian who
founded a sect in the second century. His system somewhat resembled the
Gnostics. He taught that Christ had a heavenly or spiritual body, and
assumed nothing from the <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p11.2"></span>Virgin
Mary.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p12"></span> The Marcionites were the followers
of <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxx-p12.1"></span>Marcion, a heretic of the
second century, who held the Oriental belief of two independent,
eternal, co-existing principles, one of good, the other of evil. He
applied this doctrine to Christianity. His chief opponent was <span
