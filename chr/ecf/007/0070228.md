#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XL.—Of the Foolishness of the Philosophers.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1"></span>There are innumerable sayings and
doings of the philosophers, by which their foolishness may be shown.
Therefore, since we are unable to enumerate them all, a few will be
sufficient. It is enough that it is understood that the philosophers
were neither teachers of justice, of which they were ignorant, nor of
virtue, of which they falsely boast. For what can they teach, who often
confess their own ignorance? I omit to mention <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Socrates, whose opinion is well
known. <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.2"></span>Anaxagoras proclaims
that all things are over-spread with darkness. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.3"></span>Empedocles says that the paths for
finding out the truth of the senses are narrow. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.4"></span>Democritus asserts that truth lies
sunk in a deep well; and because they nowhere find it, they therefore
affirm that no wise man has as yet existed. Since, therefore, human
wisdom has no existence (<span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.5"></span>Socrates says in the writings of
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxvi-p1.6"></span>Plato), let us follow that
which is divine, and let us give thanks to God, who has revealed and
delivered it to us; and let us congratulate ourselves, that through the
divine bounty we possess the truth and wisdom, which, though sought by
so many intellects through so many ages, philosophy <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) was not able to discover.
