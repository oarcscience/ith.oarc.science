#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIV.—Of the Origin of Sacred Rites and Superstitions.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1"></span>These are the mysteries of the gods.
Now let us inquire also into the origin of superstitions, that we may
search out by whom and at what times they were instituted. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.1"></span>Didymus, in those books which are
inscribed <span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.2"></span>Of the Explanation of
Pindar,<span id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xx-Page_230"></span> relates that <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.3"></span>Melisseus was king of the Cretans, whose
daughters were <span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.4"></span>Amalthea and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.5"></span>Melissa, who nourished <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.6"></span>Jupiter with goats’ milk and honey; that
he introduced new rites and ceremonies of sacred things, and was the
first who sacrificed to gods, that is, to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.7"></span>Vesta, who is called <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.8"></span>Tellus,—whence the poet says:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.9"></span> “And the first of the gods,  
> <span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.12"></span>Tellus,”—  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2"></span>and afterwards to the mother of the
gods. But <span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.1"></span>Euhemerus, in his sacred
history, says that <span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.2"></span>Jupiter
himself, after that he received the government, erected temples in
honour of himself in many places. For in going about the world, as he
came to each place he united the chiefs of the people to himself in
friendship and the right of hospitality; and that the remembrance of
this might be preserved, he ordered that temples should be built to him,
and annual festivals be celebrated by those connected with him in a
league of hospitality. Thus he spread the worship of himself through all
lands. But at what time they lived can easily be inferred. For <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.3"></span>Thallus writes in his history, that
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.4"></span>Belus, the king of the Assyrians,
whom the Babylonians worship, and who was the contemporary and friend of
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.5"></span>Saturnus, was three hundred and
twenty-two years before the Trojan war, and it is fourteen hundred and
seventy years since the taking of Troy. From which it is evident, that
it is not more than eighteen hundred years from the time when mankind
fell into error by the institution of new forms of divine worship.
