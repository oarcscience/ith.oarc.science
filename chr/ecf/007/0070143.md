#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p0.1"></span>Chap. V.—Of False and True Virtue; And of Knowledge.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p1"></span>But before I begin to set forth the
separate virtues, I must mark out the character of virtue itself, which
the philosophers have not rightly <span id="page_167">p. 167</span>
<span id="iii.ii.vi.v-Page_167"></span>defined, as to its nature, or in
what things it consisted; and I must describe its operation and office.
For they only retained the name, but lost its power, and nature, and
effect. But whatever they are accustomed to say in their definition of
virtue, <span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Lucilius puts together and
expresses in a few verses, which I prefer to introduce, lest, while I
refute the opinions of many, I should be longer than is necessary:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p1.2"></span> “It is virtue, O <span
> id="iii.ii.vi.v-p1.4"></span>Albinus, to pay the proper price,  
> To attend to the matters in which we are engaged, and in which we
> live.  
> It is virtue for a man to know the nature of everything.  
> It is virtue for a man to know what is right and useful and
> honourable,  
> What things are good, and what are evil.  
> What is useless, <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) base, and
> dishonourable.  
> It is virtue to know the end of an object to be sought and the means
> <span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p2.2"></span>of procuring it  
> It is virtue to be able to assign their value to riches.  
> It is virtue to give that which is really due to honour;  
> To be the enemy and the foe <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md)
> of bad men and manners, but, on the other hand, the defender of good
> men and manners;  
> To esteem these highly, to wish them well, to live in friendship with
> them,  
> Moreover, to consider the interest of one’s country first;  
> Then those of parents, to put our own interests in the third and last
> place.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p4"></span>From these definitions, which the poet
briefly puts together, <span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p4.1"></span>Marcus Tullius
derived the offices of living, following <span
id="iii.ii.vi.v-p4.2"></span>Panætius the Stoic, <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) and included them in three books.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p6"></span>But we shall presently see how false
these things are, that it may appear how much the divine condescension
has bestowed on us in opening to us the truth. He says that it is virtue
to know what is good and evil, what is base, what is honourable, what is
useful, what is useless. He might have shortened his treatise if he had
only spoken of that which is good and evil; for nothing can be useful or
honourable which is not also good, and nothing useless and base which is
not also evil. And this also appears to be thus to philosophers, and
<span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p6.1"></span>Cicero shows it likewise in the third
book of the above-mentioned treatise. <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) But knowledge cannot be virtue,
because it is not within us, but it comes to us from without. But that
which is able to pass from one to the other is not virtue, because
virtue is the property of each individual. Knowledge therefore consists
in a benefit derived from another; for it depends upon hearing. Virtue
is altogether our own; for it depends upon the will of doing that which
is good. As, therefore, in undertaking a journey, it is of no profit to
know the way, unless we also have the effort and strength for walking,
so truly knowledge is of no avail if our virtue fails. For, in general,
even they who sin perceive what is good and evil, though not perfectly;
and as often as they act improperly, they know that they sin, and
therefore endeavour to conceal their actions. But though the nature of
good and evil does not escape their notice, they are overpowered by an
evil desire to sin, because they are wanting in virtue, that is, the
desire of doing right and honourable things. Therefore that the
knowledge of good and evil is one thing, and virtue another, appears
from this, because knowledge can exist without virtue, as it has been in
the case of many of the philosophers; in which, since not to have done
what you knew to be right is justly censurable, a depraved will and a
vicious mind, which ignorance cannot excuse, will be justly punished.
Therefore, as the knowledge of good and evil is not virtue, so the doing
that which is good and the abstaining from evil is virtue. And yet
knowledge is so united with virtue, that knowledge precedes virtue, and
virtue follows knowledge; because knowledge is of no avail unless it is
followed up by action. <span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p7.3"></span>Horace
therefore speaks somewhat better: “Virtue is the fleeing from vice, and
the first wisdom is to be free from folly.” <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) But he speaks improperly, because
he defined virtue by its contrary, as though he should say, That is good
which is not evil. For when I know not what virtue is, I do not know
what vice is. Each therefore requires definition, because the nature of
the case is such that each must be understood or not understood. <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.v-p10"></span>But let us do that which he ought to
have done. It is a virtue to restrain anger, to control desire, to curb
lust; for this is to flee from vice. For almost all things which are
done unjustly and dishonestly arise from these affections. For if the
force of this emotion which is called anger be blunted, all the evil
contentions of men will be lulled to rest; no one will plot, no one will
rush forth to injure another. Also, if desire be restrained, no one will
use violence by land or by sea, no one will lead an army to carry off
and lay waste the property of others. Also, if the ardour of lusts be
repressed, every age and sex will retain its sanctity; no one will
suffer, or do anything disgraceful. Therefore all crimes and disgraceful
actions will be taken away from the life and character of men, if these
emotions are appeased and calmed by virtue. And this calming of the
emotions and affections has this meaning, that we do all things which
are right. The whole duty of virtue then is, not to sin. And assuredly
he cannot discharge this who is ignorant of God, since ignorance <span
id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="iii.ii.vi.v-Page_168"></span>of
Him from whom good things proceed must thrust a man unawares into vices.
Therefore, that I may more briefly and significantly fix the offices of
each subject, knowledge is to know God, virtue is to worship Him: the
former implies wisdom, the latter righteousness.
