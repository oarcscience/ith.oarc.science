#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chap. II.—Where Wisdom is to Be Found; Why Pythagoras and Plato Did Not Approach the Jews.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.ii-p1"></span>Wherefore, if they were not wise who
were so called, nor those of later times, who did not hesitate to
confess their want of wisdom, what remains but that wisdom is to be
sought elsewhere, since it has not been found where it was sought. But
what can we suppose to have been the reason why it was not found, though
sought with the greatest earnestness and labour by so many intellects,
and during so many ages, unless it be that philosophers sought for it
out of their own limits? And since they traversed and explored all
parts, but nowhere found any wisdom, and it must of necessity be
somewhere, it is evident that it ought especially to be sought there
where the title of folly <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md)
appears; under the covering of which God hides the treasury of wisdom
and truth, lest the secret of His divine work should be exposed to
view. <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) Whence I am accustomed to
wonder that, when <span id="iii.ii.iv.ii-p3.2"></span>Pythagoras, and
after him <span id="iii.ii.iv.ii-p3.3"></span>Plato, inflamed with the
love of searching out the truth, had penetrated as far as to the
Egyptians, and Magi, and Persians, that they might become acquainted
with their religious rites and institutions (for they suspected that
wisdom was concerned with religion), they did not approach the Jews
only, in whose possession alone it then was, and to whom they might have
gone more easily. But I think that they were turned away from them by
divine providence, that they might not know the truth, because it was
not yet permitted for the religion of the true God and righteousness to
become known to men of other nations. <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) For God had determined, as the last
time drew near, <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) to send from
heaven a great leader, <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) who
should reveal to foreign nations that which was taken away from a
perfidious <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) and ungrateful
people. And I will endeavour to discuss the subject in this book, if I
shall first have shown that wisdom is so closely united with religion,
that the one cannot be separated from the other.
