#### <span id="iii.v.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLII.

<span id="iii.v.xlii-p1"></span>At this time, by command of <span
id="iii.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>Constantine, the statues of <span
id="iii.v.xlii-p1.2"></span>Maximian Herculius were thrown down, and his
portraits removed; and, as the two old emperors were generally
delineated in one piece, the portraits of both were removed at the same
time. Thus <span id="iii.v.xlii-p1.3"></span>Diocletian lived to see a
disgrace which no former emperor had ever seen, and, under the double
load of vexation of spirit and bodily maladies, he resolved to die.
Tossing to and fro, with his soul agitated by grief, he could neither
eat nor take rest. He sighed, groaned, and wept often, and incessantly
threw himself into various postures, now on his couch, and now on the
ground. So he, who for twenty years was the most prosperous of emperors,
having been cast down into the obscurity of a private station, treated
in the most contumelious manner, and compelled to abhor life, became
incapable of receiving nourishment, and, worn out with anguish of mind,
expired.
