<span id="ix.ix.iv"></span>

#### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p0.1"></span>Sec. IV.—Certain Prayers and Laws.

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p0.2"></span>Concerning the Blessing of Water and Oil—The Constitution of Matthias.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p1.1"></span>XXIX</span>. <span
id="fr_3705"></span>[3706](#fn_3705.md) Concerning the water and the oil, I
<span id="ix.ix.iv-p2.5"></span>Matthias make a constitution. Let the
bishop bless the water, or the oil. But if he be not there, let the
presbyter bless it, the deacon standing by. But if the bishop be
present, let the presbyter and deacon stand by, and let him say thus: O
Lord of hosts, the God of powers, the creator of the waters, and the
supplier of oil, who art compassionate, and a lover of mankind, who hast
given water for drink and for cleansing, and oil to give man a cheerful
and joyful countenance; <span id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md) do
Thou now also sanctify this water and this oil through Thy Christ, in
the name of him or her that has offered them, and grant them a power to
restore health, to drive away diseases, to banish demons, and to
disperse all snares through Christ our hope, with whom glory, honour,
and worship be to Thee, and to the Holy Ghost, for ever. Amen.  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p3.2"></span>The Same Apostle’s Constitution Concerning First-Fruits and Tithes.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p4.1"></span>XXX</span>. I <span
id="fr_3707"></span>[3708](#fn_3707.md) the same make a constitution in
regard to first-fruits and tithes. Let all first-fruits be brought to
the bishop, and to the presbyters, and to the deacons, <span
id="fr_3708"></span>[3709](#fn_3708.md) for their maintenance; but let all
the tithe be for the maintenance of the rest of the clergy, and of the
virgins and widows, and of those under the trial of poverty. For the
first-fruits belong to the priests, and to those deacons that minister
to them.  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p6.2"></span>The Same Apostle’s Constitutions Concerning the Remaining Oblations.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p7.1"></span>XXXI</span>. I the same make a constitution in
regard to remainders. Those eulogies which remain at the mysteries, let
the deacons distribute them among the clergy, according to the mind of
the bishop or the presbyters: to a bishop; four parts; to a presbyter,
three <span id="fr_3709"></span>[3710](#fn_3709.md) parts; to a deacon,
two <span id="fr_3710"></span>[3711](#fn_3710.md) parts; and to the rest of
the sub-deacons, or readers, or singers, or deaconesses, one part. For
this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, that every one be
honoured according to his dignity; for the Church is the school, not of
confusion, but of good order.  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p9.2"></span>Various Canons of Paul the Apostle Concerning Those that Offer Themselves to Be Baptized—Whom We are to Receive, and Whom to Reject.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p10.1"></span>XXXII</span>. <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p10.2"></span>I also, <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p10.3"></span>Paul, <span
id="fr_3711"></span>[3712](#fn_3711.md) <span id="ix.ix.iv-p11.5"></span>
the least of the apostles, do make the following constitutions for you,
the bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, concerning canons. Those that
first come to the mystery of godliness, let them be brought to the
bishop or to the presbyters by the deacons, and let them be examined as
to the causes wherefore they come to the word of the Lord; and let those
that bring them exactly inquire about their character, and give them
their testimony. Let their manners and their life be inquired into, and
whether they be slaves or freemen. And if any one be a slave, let him be
asked who is his master. If he be slave to one of the faithful, let his
master be asked if he can give him a good character. If he cannot, let
him be rejected, until he show himself to be worthy to his master. But
if he does give him a good character, let him be admitted. But if he be
household slave <span id="page_495">p. 495</span> <span
id="ix.ix.iv-Page_495"></span>to an heathen, let him be taught to please
his master, that the word be not blasphemed. If, then, he have a wife,
or a woman hath an husband, let them be taught to be content with each
other; but if they be unmarried, let them learn not to commit
fornication, but to enter into lawful marriage. But if his master be one
of the faithful, and knows that he is guilty of fornication, and yet
does not give him a wife, or to the woman an husband, let him be
separated; but if anyone hath a demon, let him indeed be taught piety,
but not received into communion before he be cleansed; yet if death be
near, let him be received. If any one be a maintainer of harlots, let
him either leave off to prostitute women, or else let him be rejected.
If a harlot come, let her leave off whoredom, or else let her be
rejected. If a maker of idols come, let him either leave off his
employment, or let him be rejected. If one belonging to the
theatre <span id="fr_3712"></span>[3713](#fn_3712.md) come, whether it be
man or woman, or charioteer, or dueller, or racer, or player of prizes,
or Olympic gamester, or one that plays on the pipe, on the lute, or on
the harp at those games, or a dancing-master or an huckster, <span
id="fr_3713"></span>[3714](#fn_3713.md) either let them leave off their
employments, or let them be rejected. If a soldier come, let him be
taught to “do no injustice, to accuse no man falsely, and to be content
with his allotted wages:” <span id="fr_3714"></span>[3715](#fn_3714.md) if
he submit to those rules, let him be received; but if he refuse them,
let him be rejected. He that is guilty of sins not to be named, a
sodomite, an effeminate person, a magician, an enchanter, an astrologer,
a diviner, an user of magic verses, a juggler, a mountebank, one that
makes amulets, a charmer, a soothsayer, a fortune-teller, an observer of
palmistry; he that, when he meets you, observes defects in the eyes or
feet of the birds or cats, or noises, or symbolical sounds: let these be
proved for some time, for this sort of wickedness is hard to be washed
away; and if they leave off those practices, let them be received; but
if they will not agree to that, let them be rejected. Let a concubine,
who is slave to an unbeliever, and confines herself to her master alone,
be received; <span id="fr_3715"></span>[3716](#fn_3715.md) but if she be
incontinent with others, let her be rejected. If one of the faithful
hath a concubine, if she be a bond-servant, let him leave off that way,
and marry in a legal manner: if she be a free woman, let him marry her
in a lawful manner; if he does not, let him be rejected. Let him that
follows the Gentile customs, or Jewish fables, either reform, or let him
be rejected. If any one follows the sports of the theatre, their
huntings, or horse-races, or combats, either let him leave them off, or
let him be rejected. Let him who is to be a catechumen be a catechumen
for three years; but if any one be diligent, and has a good-will to his
business, let him be admitted: for it is not the length of time, but the
course of life, that is judged. Let him that teaches, although he be one
of the laity, yet, if he be skilful in the word and grave in his
manners, teach; for “they shall be all taught of God.” <span
id="fr_3716"></span>[3717](#fn_3716.md) Let all the faithful, whether men
or women, when they rise from sleep, before they go to work, when they
have washed themselves, pray; but if any catechetic instruction be held,
let the faithful person prefer the word of piety before his work. Let
the faithful person, whether man or woman, treat servants kindly, as we
have ordained in the foregoing books, and have taught in our
epistles. <span id="fr_3717"></span>[3718](#fn_3717.md)  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p17.4"></span>Upon Which Days Servants are Not to Work.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p18"></span>XXXIII. I <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p18.1"></span>Peter and <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p18.2"></span>Paul do make the following constitutions. Let
the slaves work five days; but on the Sabbath-day and the Lord’s day let
them have leisure to go to church for instruction in piety. We have said
that the Sabbath is on account of the creation, and the Lord’s day of
the resurrection. Let slaves rest from their work all the great week,
and that which follows it—for the one in memory of the passion, and the
other of the resurrection; and there is need they should be instructed
who it is that suffered and rose again, and who it is permitted Him to
suffer, and raised Him again. Let them have rest from their work on the
Ascension, because it was the conclusion of the dispensation by Christ.
Let them rest at Pentecost, because of the coming of the Holy Spirit,
which was given to those that believed in Christ. Let them rest on the
festival of His birth, because on it the unexpected favour was granted
to men, that <span id="ix.ix.iv-p18.3"></span>Jesus Christ, the Logos of
God, should be born of the Virgin <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p18.4"></span>Mary, <span
id="fr_3718"></span>[3719](#fn_3718.md) for the salvation of the
world. <span id="fr_3719"></span>[3720](#fn_3719.md) Let them rest on the
festival of Epiphany, because on it a manifestation took place of the
divinity of Christ, for the Father bore testimony to Him at the baptism;
and the Paraclete, in the form of a dove, pointed out to the bystanders
Him to whom testimony was borne. Let them rest on the days of the
apostles: for they were appointed your teachers <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p20.3"></span>to bring you to Christ, and made you worthy
of the Spirit. Let them rest on the day of the first <span
id="fr_3720"></span>[3721](#fn_3720.md) martyr <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p21.2"></span>Stephen, and of the other holy martyrs who
preferred Christ to their own life. <span id="page_496">p. 496</span>
<span id="ix.ix.iv-Page_496"></span>  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p21.3"></span>At What Hours, and Why, We are to Pray.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p22"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p22.1"></span>XXXIV</span>. Offer up your prayers in the
morning, at the third hour, the sixth, the ninth, the evening, and at
cock-crowing: in the morning, returning thanks that the Lord has sent
you light, that He has brought you past the night, and brought on the
day; at the third hour, because at that hour the Lord received the
sentence of condemnation from <span id="ix.ix.iv-p22.2"></span>Pilate;
at the sixth, because at that hour He was crucified; <span
id="fr_3721"></span>[3722](#fn_3721.md) at the ninth, because all things
were in commotion at the crucifixion of the Lord, as trembling at the
bold attempt of the impious Jews, and not bearing the injury offered to
their Lord; in the evening, giving thanks that He has given you the
night to rest from the daily labours; at cock-crowing, because that hour
brings the good news of the coming on of the day for the operations
proper for the light. But if it be not possible to go to the church on
account of the unbelievers, thou, O bishop, shalt assemble them in a
house, that a godly man may not enter into an assembly of the ungodly.
For it is not the place that sanctifies the man, but the man the place.
And if the ungodly possess the place, do thou avoid it, because it is
profaned by them. For as holy priests sanctify a place, so do the
profane ones defile it. If it be not possible to assemble either in the
church or in a house, let every one by himself sing, and read, and pray,
or two or three together. For “where two or three are gathered together
in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” <span
id="fr_3722"></span>[3723](#fn_3722.md) Let not one of the faithful pray
with a catechumen, no, not in the house: for it is not reasonable that
he who is admitted should be polluted with one not admitted. Let not one
of the godly pray with an heretic, no, not in the house. For “what
fellowship hath light with darkness?” <span
id="fr_3723"></span>[3724](#fn_3723.md) Let Christians, whether men or
women, who have connections with slaves, either leave them off, or let
them be rejected.  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p25.3"></span>The Constitution of James the Brother of Christ Concerning Evening Prayer.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p26"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p26.1"></span>XXXV</span>. I James, <span
id="fr_3724"></span>[3725](#fn_3724.md) the brother of Christ according to
the flesh, but His servant as the only begotten God, and one appointed
bishop of Jerusalem by the Lord Himself, and the Apostles, do ordain
thus: When it is evening, thou, O bishop, shall assemble the church; and
after the repetition of the psalm at the lighting up the lights, the
deacon shall bid prayers for the catechumens, the energumens, the
illuminated, and the penitents, as we have formerly said. But after the
dismission of these, the deacon shall say: So many as are of the
faithful, let us pray to the Lord. And after the bidding prayer, which
is formerly set down, he shall say:—  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p27.5"></span>The Bidding Prayer for the Evening.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p28"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p28.1"></span>XXXVI</span>. Save us, O God, and raise us up
by Thy Christ. Let us stand up, and beg for the mercies of the Lord, and
His compassions, for the angel of peace, for what things are good and
profitable, for a Christian departure out of this life, an evening and a
night of peace, and free from sin; and let us beg that the whole course
of our life may be unblameable. Let us dedicate ourselves and one
another to the living God through His Christ. And let the bishop add
this prayer, and say:—  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p28.2"></span>The Thanksgiving for the Evening.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p29"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p29.1"></span>XXXVII</span>. O God, who art without
beginning and without end, the Maker of the whole world by Christ, and
the Provider for it, but before all <span
id="fr_3725"></span>[3726](#fn_3725.md) His God and Father, the Lord <span
id="fr_3726"></span>[3727](#fn_3726.md) of the Spirit, and the King of
intelligible and sensible beings; who hast made the day for the works of
light, and the night for the refreshment of our infirmity,—for “the day
is Thine, the night also is Thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the
sun,” <span id="fr_3727"></span>[3728](#fn_3727.md) —do Thou now, O Lord,
Thou lover of mankind, and Fountain of all good, mercifully accept of
this our evening thanksgiving. Thou who hast brought us through the
length of the day, and hast brought us to the beginnings of the night,
preserve us by Thy Christ, afford us a peaceable evening, and a night
free from sin, and vouchsafe us everlasting life by Thy Christ, through
whom glory, honour, and worship be to Thee in <span
id="fr_3728"></span>[3729](#fn_3728.md) the Holy Spirit for ever. Amen. And
let the deacon say: Bow down for the laying on of hands. And let the
bishop say: O God of our fathers, and Lord of mercy, who didst form man
of Thy wisdom a rational creature, and beloved of God more than the
other beings upon this earth, and didst give him authority to rule over
the creatures upon the earth, and didst ordain by Thy will rulers and
priests—the former for the security of life, the latter for a regular
worship,—do Thou now also look down, O Lord Almighty, and cause Thy face
to shine upon Thy people, who bow down the neck of their heart, and
bless them by Christ; through whom Thou hast enlightened us with the
light of <span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="ix.ix.iv-Page_497"></span>knowledge, and hast revealed Thyself to
us; with whom worthy adoration is due from every rational and holy
nature to Thee, and to the Spirit, who is the Comforter, for ever. Amen.
And let the deacon say: “Depart in peace.” In like manner, in the
morning, after the repetition of the morning psalm, and his dismission
of the catechumens, the energumens, the candidates for baptism, and the
penitents, and after the usual bidding of prayers, that we may not again
repeat the same things, let the deacon add after the words, Save us, O
God, and raise us up by Thy grace: Let us beg of the Lord His mercies
and His compassions, that this morning and this day may be with peace
and without sin, as also all the time of our sojourning; that He will
grant us His angel of peace, a Christian departure out of this life, and
that God will be merciful and gracious. Let us dedicate ourselves and
one another to the living God through His Only-begotten. And let the
bishop add this prayer, and say:—  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p33.2"></span>The Thanksgiving for the Morning.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p34"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p34.1"></span>XXXVIII</span>. O God, the God of spirits and
of all flesh, who art beyond compare, and standest in need of nothing,
who hast given the sun to have rule over the day, and the moon and the
stars to have rule over the night, do Thou now also look down upon us
with gracious eyes, and receive our morning thanksgivings, and have
mercy upon us; for we have not “spread out our hands unto a strange
God;” <span id="fr_3729"></span>[3730](#fn_3729.md) for there is not among
us any new God, but Thou, the eternal God, who art without end, who hast
given us our being through Christ, and given us our well-being through
Him. Do Thou vouchsafe us also, through Him, eternal life; with whom
glory, and honour, and worship be to Thee and to the Holy Spirit for
ever. Amen. And let the deacon say: Bow down for the laying on of hands.
And let the bishop add this prayer, saying:—  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p35.2"></span>The Imposition of Hands for the Morning.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p36"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p36.1"></span>XXXIX</span>. O God, who art faithful and
true, who “hast mercy on thousands and ten thousands of them that love
Thee,” <span id="fr_3730"></span>[3731](#fn_3730.md) the lover of the
humble, and the protector of the needy, of whom all things stand in
need, for all things are subject to Thee; look down upon this Thy
people, who bow down their heads to Thee, and bless them with spiritual
blessing. “Keep them as the apple of an eye,” <span
id="fr_3731"></span>[3732](#fn_3731.md) preserve them in piety and
righteousness, and vouchsafe them eternal life in Christ <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p38.2"></span>Jesus Thy beloved Son, with whom glory,
honour, and worship be to Thee and to the Holy Spirit, now and always,
and for ever and ever. Amen. And let the deacon say: “Depart in peace.”
And when the first-fruits are offered, the bishop gives thanks in this
manner:—  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p38.3"></span>The Form of Prayer for the First-Fruits.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p39"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p39.1"></span>XL</span>. We give thanks to Thee, O Lord
Almighty, the Creator of the whole world, and its Preserver, through Thy
only begotten Son <span id="ix.ix.iv-p39.2"></span>Jesus Christ our
Lord, for the first-fruits which are offered to Thee, not in such a
manner as we ought, but as we are able. For what man is there that can
worthily give Thee thanks for those things Thou hast given them to
partake of? The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, and of all
the saints, who madest all things fruitful by Thy word, and didst
command the earth to bring forth various fruits for our rejoicing and
our food; who hast given to the duller and more sheepish sort of
creatures juices—herbs to them that feed on herbs, and to some flesh, to
others seeds, but to us corn, as advantageous and proper food, and many
other things—some for our necessities, some for our health, and some for
our pleasure. On all these accounts, therefore, art Thou worthy of
exalted hymns of praise for Thy beneficence by Christ, through
whom <span id="fr_3732"></span>[3733](#fn_3732.md) glory, honour, and
worship be to Thee, in the Holy Spirit, for ever. Amen. Concerning those
that are at rest in Christ: After the bidding prayer, that we may not
repeat it again, the deacon shall add as follows:—  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p40.2"></span>The Bidding Prayer for Those Departed.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p41"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p41.1"></span>XLI</span>. Let us pray for our brethren that
are at rest <span id="fr_3733"></span>[3734](#fn_3733.md) in Christ, that
God, the lover of mankind, who has received his soul, may forgive him
every sin, voluntary and involuntary, and may be merciful and gracious
to him, and give him his lot in the land of the pious that are sent into
the bosom of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, with all those that have
pleased Him and done His will from the beginning of the world, whence
all sorrow, grief, and lamentation are banished. Let us arise, let us
dedicate ourselves and one another to the eternal God, through that Word
which was in the beginning. And let the bishop say: O Thou who art by
nature immortal, and hast no end of Thy being, from whom every creature,
whether immortal or mortal, is derived; who didst make man a rational
creature, the citizen of this world, in his constitution mortal, and
didst add the promise of a resurrection; who didst not suffer <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p42.3"></span>Enoch and <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p42.4"></span>Elijah to taste of death: “the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, who art the God of
them, <span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="ix.ix.iv-Page_498"></span>not as of dead, but as of living persons:
for the souls of all men live with Thee, and the spirits of the
righteous are in Thy hand, which no torment can touch;” <span
id="fr_3734"></span>[3735](#fn_3734.md) for they are all sanctified under
Thy hand: do Thou now also look upon this Thy servant, whom Thou hast
selected and received into another state, and forgive him if voluntarily
or involuntarily he has sinned, and afford him merciful angels, and
place him in the bosom of the patriarchs, and prophets, and apostles,
and of all those that have pleased Thee from the beginning of the world,
where there is no grief, sorrow, nor lamentation; but the peaceable
region of the godly, and the undisturbed land of the upright, and of
those that therein see, the glory of Thy Christ; by whom <span
id="fr_3735"></span>[3736](#fn_3735.md) glory, honour, and worship,
thanksgiving, and adoration be to Thee, in the Holy Spirit, for ever.
Amen. And let the deacon say: Bow down, and receive the blessing. And
let the bishop give thanks for them, saying as follows: “O Lord, save
Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance,” <span
id="fr_3736"></span>[3737](#fn_3736.md) which Thou hast purchased with the
precious blood of Thy Christ. Feed them under Thy right hand, and cover
them under Thy wings, and grant that they may “fight the good fight, and
finish their course, and keep the faith” <span
id="fr_3737"></span>[3738](#fn_3737.md) immutably, unblameably, and
unreprovably, through our Lord <span id="ix.ix.iv-p46.2"></span>Jesus
Christ, Thy beloved Son, with whom glory, honour, and worship be to Thee
and to the Holy Spirit for ever. Amen.  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p46.3"></span>How and When We Ought to Celebrate the Memorials of the Faithful Departed, and that We Ought Then to Give Somewhat Out of Their Goods to the Poor.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p47"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p47.1"></span>XLII</span>. Let the third day of the
departed be celebrated with psalms, and lessons, and prayers, on account
of Him who arose within the space of three days; and let the ninth day
be celebrated in remembrance of the living, and of the departed; and the
fortieth <span id="fr_3738"></span>[3739](#fn_3738.md) day according to the
ancient pattern: for so did the people lament <span
id="ix.ix.iv-p48.1"></span>Moses, and the anniversary day in memory of
him. <span id="fr_3739"></span>[3740](#fn_3739.md) And let alms be given to
the poor out of his goods for a memorial of him. <span
id="fr_3740"></span>[3741](#fn_3740.md)  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p50.2"></span>That Memorials or Mandates Do Not at All Profit the Ungodly Who are Dead.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p51"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p51.1"></span>XLIII</span>. These things we say concerning
the pious; for as to the ungodly, if thou givest all the world to the
poor, thou wilt not benefit him at all. For to whom the Deity was an
enemy while he was alive, it is certain it will be so also when he is
departed; for there is no unrighteousness with Him. For “the Lord <span
id="fr_3741"></span>[3742](#fn_3741.md) is righteous, and has loved
righteousness.” <span id="fr_3742"></span>[3743](#fn_3742.md) And, “Behold
the man and his work.” <span id="fr_3743"></span>[3744](#fn_3743.md)  

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p54.2"></span>Concerning Drunkards.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p55"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p55.1"></span>XLIV</span>. Now, when you are invited to
their memorials, do you feast with good order, and the fear of God, as
disposed to intercede for those that are departed. For since you are the
presbyters and deacons of Christ, you ought always to be sober, both
among yourselves and among others, that so you may be able to warn the
unruly. Now the Scripture says, “The men in power are passionate. But
let them not drink wine, lest by drinking they forget wisdom, and are

Wherefore <span id="fr_3745"></span>[3746](#fn_3745.md) both the presbyters
and the deacons are those of authority in the Church next to God
Almighty and His beloved Son. <span id="fr_3746"></span>[3747](#fn_3746.md)
We say this, not they are not to drink at all, otherwise it would be to
the reproach of what God has made for cheerfulness, but that they be not
disordered with wine. For the Scripture does not say, Do not drink wine;
but what says it? “Drink not wine to drunkenness;” and again, “Thorns
spring up in the hand of the drunkard.” <span
id="fr_3747"></span>[3748](#fn_3747.md) Nor do we say this only to those of
the clergy, but also to every lay Christian, upon whom the name of our
Lord <span id="ix.ix.iv-p59.5"></span>Jesus Christ is called. For to
them also it is said, “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath
uneasiness? who hath babbling? who hath red eyes? who hath wounds
without cause? Do not these things belong to those that tarry long at
the wine, and that go to seek where drinking meetings are?” <span

##### <span id="ix.ix.iv-p60.2"></span>Concerning the Receiving Such as are Persecuted for Christ’s Sake.

<span id="ix.ix.iv-p61"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.iv-p61.1"></span>XLV</span>. Receive ye those that are
persecuted <span id="fr_3749"></span>[3750](#fn_3749.md) on account of the
faith, and who fly from city to city, <span
id="fr_3750"></span>[3751](#fn_3750.md) as mindful of the words of the
Lord. For, knowing that though “the spirit be willing, the flesh is
weak,” <span id="fr_3751"></span>[3752](#fn_3751.md) they fly away, and
prefer the spoiling of their goods, that they may preserve the name of
Christ in themselves without denying it. Supply them therefore with what
they want, and thereby fulfil the commandment of the Lord. <span
