#### <span id="iii.v.xix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIX.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p1"></span>Matters having been thus concerted, <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Diocletian and <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.2"></span>Galerius went in procession to publish the
nomination of <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.3"></span>Cæsars. Every one looked
at <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.4"></span>Constantine; for there was no doubt
that the choice would fall on him. The troops present, as well as the
chief soldiers of the other legions, who had been summoned to the
solemnity, fixed their eyes on <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.5"></span>Constantine, exulted in the hope of his
approaching election, and occupied themselves in prayers for his
prosperity. Near three miles from Nicomedia there is an eminence, on the
summit of which <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.6"></span>Galerius formerly
received the purple; and <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.7"></span>there a
pillar, with the statue of <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.8"></span>Jupiter, was
placed. Thither the procession went. An assembly of the soldiers was
called. <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.9"></span>Diocletian, with tears,
harangued them, and said that he was become infirm, that he needed
repose after his fatigues, and that he would resign the empire into
hands more vigorous and able, and at the same time appoint new <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.10"></span>Cæsars. The spectators, with the utmost
earnestness, waited for the nomination. Suddenly he declared that <span
id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span id="iii.v.xix-Page_309"></span>the
<span id="iii.v.xix-p1.11"></span>Cæsars were <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.12"></span>Severus and <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.13"></span>Maximin. The amazement was universal. <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.14"></span>Constantine stood near in public view, and
men began to question amongst themselves whether his name too had not
been changed into <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.15"></span>Maximin; when, in
the sight of all, <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.16"></span>Galerius, stretching
back his hand, put <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.17"></span>Constantine aside,
and drew <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.18"></span>Daia forward, and, having
divested him of the garb of a private person, set him in the most
conspicuous place. All men wondered who he could be, and from whence he
came; but none ventured to interpose or move objections, so confounded
were their minds at the strange and unlooked-for event. <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.19"></span>Diocletian took off his purple robe, put it
on <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.20"></span>Daia, and resumed his own original
name of <span id="iii.v.xix-p1.21"></span>Diocles. He descended from the
tribunal, and passed through Nicomedia in a chariot; and then this old
emperor, like a veteran soldier freed from military service, was
dismissed into his own country; while <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.22"></span>Daia, lately taken from the tending of
cattle in forests to serve as a common soldier, immediately made one of
the life-guard, presently a tribune, and next day <span
id="iii.v.xix-p1.23"></span>Cæsar, obtained authority to trample under
foot and oppress the empire of the East; a person ignorant alike of war
and of civil affairs, and from a herdsman become a leader of armies.
