#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIV.—The Overthrowing of the Arguments Above Urged by Way of Objection.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxiv-p1"></span>Come, let us now consider whether a
teacher sent from heaven can fail to be perfect. I do not as yet speak
of Him whom they deny to have come from God. Let us suppose that some
one were to be sent from heaven to instruct the life of men in the first
principles of virtue, and to form them to righteousness. No one can
doubt but that this teacher, who is sent from heaven, would be as
perfect in the knowledge of all things as in virtue, lest there should
be no difference between a heavenly and an earthly teacher. For in the
case of a man his instruction can by no means be from within and of
himself. <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) For the mind, shut in
by earthly organs, and hindered by a corrupt <span
id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) body, of itself can neither comprehend
nor receive the truth, unless it is taught from another source. <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) And if it had this power in the
greatest degree, yet it would be unable to attain to the highest virtue,
and to resist all vices, the materials of which are contained in our
bodily <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) organs. Hence it comes to
pass, that an earthly teacher cannot be perfect. But a teacher from
heaven, to whom His divine nature gives knowledge, and His immortality
gives virtue, must of necessity in His teaching also, as in other
things, be perfect and complete. But this cannot by any means happen,
unless He should take to Himself a mortal body. And the reason why it
cannot happen is manifest. For if He should come to men as God, not to
mention that mortal eyes cannot look upon and endure the glory of His
majesty in His own person, assuredly God will not be able to teach
virtue; for, inasmuch as He is without a body, He will not practice the
things which He will teach, and through this His teaching will not be
perfect. Otherwise, if it is the greatest virtue patiently to endure
pain for the sake of righteousness and duty, if it is virtue not to fear
death itself when threatened, and when inflicted to undergo it with
fortitude; it follows that the perfect teacher ought both to teach these
things by precept, and to confirm them by practice. For he who gives
precepts for the life, ought to remove every method <span
id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) of excuse, that he may impose upon men
the necessity of obedience, not by any constraint, but by a sense of
shame, and yet may leave them liberty, that a reward may be appointed
for those who obey, because it was in their power not to obey if they so
wished; and a punishment for those who do not obey, because it was in
their power to obey if they so wished. How then can excuse be removed,
unless the teacher should practice what he teaches, and as it were go
before <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) and hold out his hand to
one who is about to follow? But how can one practice what he teaches,
unless he is like him whom he teaches? For if he be subject to no
passion, a man may thus answer him who is the teacher: It is my wish not
to sin, but I am overpowered; for I am clothed with frail and weak
flesh: it is this which covets, which is angry, which fears pain and
death. And thus I am led on against my will; <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) and I sin, not because it is my wish,
but because I am compelled. I myself perceive that I sin; but the
necessity imposed by my frailty, which I am unable to resist, impels me.
What will that teacher of righteousness say in reply to these things?
How will he refute and convict a man who shall allege the frailty of the
flesh as an excuse for his faults, unless he himself also shall be
clothed with flesh, so that he may show that even the flesh is capable
of virtue? For obstinacy cannot be refuted except by example. For the
things which you teach cannot have any weight unless you shall be the
first to practice them; because the nature of men is inclined to faults,
and wishes to sin not only with indulgence, but also with a reasonable
plea. <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) It is befitting <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxiv-Page_126"></span>that a master and teacher of virtue
should most closely resemble man, that by overpowering sin he may teach
man that sin may be overpowered by him. But if he is immortal, he can by
no means propose an example to man. For there will stand forth some one
persevering in his opinion, and will say: You indeed do not sin, because
you are free from this body; you do not covet, because nothing is needed
by an immortal; but I have need of many things for the support of this
life. You do not fear death, because it can have no power against you.
You despise pain, because you can suffer no violence. But I, a mortal,
fear both, because they bring upon me the severest tortures, which the
weakness of the flesh cannot endure. A teacher of virtue therefore ought
to have taken away this excuse from men, that no one may ascribe it to
necessity that he sins, rather than to his own fault. Therefore, that a
teacher may be perfect, no objection ought to be brought forward by him
who is to be taught, so that if he should happen to say, You enjoin
impossibilities; the teacher may answer, See, I myself do them. But I am
clothed with flesh, and it is the property of flesh to sin. <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) I too bear the same flesh, and yet sin
does not bear rule in me. It is difficult for me to despise riches,
because otherwise I am unable to live in this body. See, I too have a
body, and yet I contend against every desire. I am not able to bear pain
or death for righteousness, because I am frail. See, pain and death have
power over me also; and I overcome those very things which you fear,
that I may make you victorious over pain and death. I go before you
through those things which you allege that it is impossible to endure:
if you are not able to follow me giving directions, follow me going
before you. In this way all excuse is taken away, and you must confess
that man is unjust through his own fault, since he does not follow a
teacher of virtue, who is at the same time a guide. You see, therefore,
how much more perfect is a teacher who is mortal, because he is able to
be a guide to one who is mortal, than one who is immortal, for he is
unable to teach patient endurance who is not subject to passions. Nor,
however, does this extend so far that I prefer man to God; but to show
that man cannot be a perfect teacher unless he is also God, that he may
by his heavenly authority impose upon men the necessity of obedience;
nor God, unless he is clothed with a mortal body, that by carrying out
his precepts to their completion <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md)
in actions, he may bind others by the necessity of obedience. It plainly
therefore appears, that he who is a guide of life and teacher of
righteousness must have a body, and that his teaching cannot otherwise
be full and perfect, unless it has a root and foundation, and remains
firm and fixed among men; and that he himself must undergo weakness of
flesh and body, and display in himself <span
id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) the virtue of which he is a teacher,
that he may teach it at the same time both by words and deeds. Also, he
must be subject to death and all sufferings, since the duties of virtue
are occupied with the enduring of suffering, and the undergoing death;
all which, as I have said, a perfect teacher ought to endure, that he
may teach the possibility of their being endured.
