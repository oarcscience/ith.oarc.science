<span id="vi.ii.xiii"></span>

#### <span id="vi.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>from the thirteenth chapter. <span id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md)

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>1.
“And I saw a beast rising up from the sea, like unto a leopard.”\] This
signifies the kingdom of that time of Antichrist, and the people mingled
with the variety of nations.  

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p3"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p3.1"></span>2.
“His feet were as the feet of a bear.”\] A strong and most unclean
beast, the feet are to be understood as his leaders.  

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p4"></span>“And his mouth as the mouth of a
lion.”\] That is, his mouth armed for blood is his bidding, and a tongue
which will proceed to nothing else than to the shedding of blood.  

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p5"></span>\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*  

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.1"></span>18.
“His number is the name of a man, and his number is Six hundred
threescore and six.”\] As they have it reckoned from the Greek
characters, they thus find it among many to be <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.2"></span>τειταν</span>, for <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.3"></span>τειταν</span> has this number, which the
Gentiles call Sol and Phœbus; and it is reckoned in Greek thus: <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.4"></span>τ</span> three hundred,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.5"></span>ε</span> five,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.6"></span>ι</span> ten,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.7"></span>τ</span> three
hundred, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.8"></span>α</span>
one, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.9"></span>ν</span>
fifty,—which taken together become six hundred and sixty-six. For as far
as belongs to the Greek letters, they fill up this number and name;
which name if you wish to turn into Latin, it is understood by the
antiphrase <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.10"></span>DICLUX</span>, which letters are reckoned
in this manner: since D figures five hundred, I one, C a hundred, L
fifty, V five, X ten,—which by the reckoning up of the letters makes
similarly six hundred and sixty-six, that is, what in Greek gives <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.11"></span>τειταν</span>, to wit,
what in Latin is called <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p6.12"></span>DICLUX</span>; by which name, expressed by
antiphrases, we understand Antichrist, who, although he be cut off from
the supernal light, and deprived thereof, yet transforms himself into an
angel of light, daring to call himself light. <span
id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) Moreover, we find in a certain
Greek codex <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.2"></span>αντεμος</span>, which letters being reckoned
up, you will find to give the number as above: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.3"></span>α</span> one, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.4"></span>ν</span> fifty, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.5"></span>τ</span> three hundred, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.6"></span>ε</span> five, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.7"></span>μ</span> forty, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.8"></span>ο</span> seventy, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.9"></span>ς</span> two
hundred,—which together makes six hundred and sixty-six, according to
the Greeks. Moreover, there is another name in Gothic of him, which will
be evident of itself, that is, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.10"></span>γενσήρικος</span>, which in the same way
you will reckon in Greek letters: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.11"></span>γ</span> three, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.12"></span>ε</span> five, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.13"></span>ν</span> fifty, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.14"></span>σ</span> two hundred, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.15"></span>η</span> eight, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.16"></span>ρ</span> a hundred,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.17"></span>ι</span> ten,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.18"></span>κ</span> twenty,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.19"></span>ο</span> seventy,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p7.20"></span>ς</span> also two
hundred, which, as has been said above, make six hundred and sixty-six.
 

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p8"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p8.1"></span>11.
“And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth.”\] He is speaking
of the great and false prophet who is to do signs, and portents, and
falsehoods before him in the presence of men.  

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p9"></span>“And he had two horns like a lamb—that
is, the appearance within of a man—and he spoke like a dragon.”\] But
the devil speaks full of malice; for he shall do these things in the
presence of men, so that even the dead appear to rise again. <span
id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span id="vi.ii.xiii-Page_357"></span>  

<span id="vi.ii.xiii-p10"></span><span id="vi.ii.xiii-p10.1"></span>13.
“And he shall make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men.”\]
Yes (as I also have said), in the sight of men. Magicians do these
things, by the aid of the apostate angels, even to this day. He shall
cause also that a golden image of Antichrist shall be placed in the
temple at Jerusalem, and that the apostate angel should enter, and
thence utter voices and oracles. Moreover, he himself shall contrive
that his servants and children should receive as a mark on their
foreheads, or on their right hands, the number of his name, lest any one
should buy or sell them. <span id="vi.ii.xiii-p10.2"></span>Daniel had
previously predicted his contempt and provocation of God. “And he shall
place,” says he, “his temple within Samaria, upon the illustrious and
holy mountain that is at Jerusalem, an image such as <span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p10.3"></span>Nebuchadnezzar had made.” <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) Thence here he places, and by and
by here he renews, that of which the Lord, admonishing His churches
concerning the last times and their dangers, says: “But when ye shall
see the contempt which is spoken of by <span
id="vi.ii.xiii-p11.2"></span>Daniel the prophet standing in the holy
place, let him who readeth understand.” <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) It is called a contempt when God is
provoked, because idols are worshipped instead of God, or when the dogma
of heretics is introduced in the churches. But it is a turning away
because stedfast men, seduced by false signs and portents, are turned
away from their salvation.
