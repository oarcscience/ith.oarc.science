<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxix"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxix-p0.1"></A>Chap. XLIII.&#8212;Of the Name of Jesus Christ, and His Twofold Nativity.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxix-p1"></A>But lest by any chance there should be any doubt in your mind why we call Him <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxix-p1.1"></A>Jesus Christ, who was born of God before the world, and who was born of man three hundred years ago, I will briefly explain to you the reason. The same person is the son of God and of man. For He was twice born: first of God, in the spirit, before the origin of the world; afterwards in the flesh of man, in the reign of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxix-p1.2"></A>Augustus; and in connection with this fact is an illustrious and great mystery, in which is contained both the salvation of men and the religion of the Supreme God, and all truth. For when first the accursed and impious worship of gods crept in through the treachery of the demons, then the religion of God remained with the Hebrews alone, who, not by any law, but after the manner of their fathers, observed the worship handed down to them by successive generations,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1517"></A><A HREF="#fn_1517"><FONT SIZE="1">1518</FONT></A>
 even until the time when they went forth out of Egypt under the leadership of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xxxix-p2.2"></A>Moses, the first of all the prophets, through whom the law was given to them from God; and they were afterwards called Jews. Therefore they served God, being bound by the chains of the law. But they also, by degrees going astray to profane rites, undertook the worship of strange gods, and, leaving the worship of their father, sacrificed to senseless images. Therefore God sent to them prophets filled with the Divine Spirit, to upbraid them with their sins and proclaim repentance, to threaten them with the vengeance which would follow, and announce that it would come to pass, if they persisted in the same faults, that He would send another as the bearer of a new law; and having removed the ungrateful people from their inheritance, He would assemble to Himself a more faithful people from foreign nations. But they not only persisted in their course, but even slew the messengers themselves. Therefore He condemned them on account of these deeds: nor did He any longer send messengers to a stubborn people; but He sent His own Son, to call all nations to the favour of God. Nor, however, did He shut them out, impious and ungrateful as they were, from the hope of salvation: but He sent Him to them before all others,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1518"></A><A HREF="#fn_1518"><FONT SIZE="1">1519</FONT></A>
 that if they should by chance obey, they might not lose that which they had received; but if they should refuse to receive their God, then, the heirs being removed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1519"></A><A HREF="#fn_1519"><FONT SIZE="1">1520</FONT></A>
 the Gentiles would come into possession. Therefore the supreme Father ordered Him to descend to the earth, and to put on a human body, that, being subject to the sufferings of the flesh, He might teach virtue and patience not only by words, but also by deeds. Therefore He was born a second time as man, of a virgin, without a father, that, as in His first spiritual birth, being born of God alone, He was made a sacred spirit, so in His second and fleshly birth, being born of a mother only, He might become holy flesh, that through Him the flesh, which had become subject to sin, might be freed from destruction. &#160;</p>
