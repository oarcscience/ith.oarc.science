#### <span id="iii.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p1"></span>After an interval of some years from the
death of <span id="iii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Nero, there arose another
tyrant no less wicked (<span id="iii.v.iii-p1.2"></span>Domitian), who,
although his government was exceedingly odious, for a very long time
oppressed his subjects, and reigned in security, until at length he
stretched forth his impious hands against the Lord. Having been
instigated by evil demons to persecute the righteous people, he was then
delivered into the power of his enemies, and suffered due punishment. To
be murdered in his own palace was not vengeance ample enough: the very
memory of his name was erased. For although he had erected many
admirable edifices, and rebuilt the Capitol, and left other
distinguished marks of his magnificence, yet the senate did so persecute
his name, as to leave no remains of his statues, or traces of the
inscriptions put up in honour of him; and by most solemn and severe
decrees it branded him, even after death, with perpetual infamy. Thus,
the commands of the tyrant having been rescinded, the Church was not
only restored to her former state, but she shone forth with additional
splendour, and became more and more flourishing. And in the times that
followed, while many well-deserving princes guided the helm of the Roman
empire, the Church suffered no violent assaults from her enemies, and
she extended her hands unto the east and unto the west, insomuch that
now there was not any the most remote corner of the earth to which the
divine religion had not penetrated, or any nation of manners so
barbarous that did not, by being converted to the worship of God, become
mild and gentle. <span id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964)
