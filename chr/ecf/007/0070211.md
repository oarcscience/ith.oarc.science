#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIII.—Of the Gods and Sacred Rites of the Barbarians.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1"></span>We have spoken respecting the gods:
now we will speak of the rites and practices of their sacred
institutions. A human victim used to be immolated to the <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.1"></span>Cyprian Jupiter, as <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.2"></span>Teucer had appointed. Thus also the
Tauri used to offer strangers to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.3"></span>Diana; the <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.4"></span>Latian Jupiter also was propitiated
with human blood. Also before <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p1.5"></span>Saturnus, men of sixty years of age,
according to the oracle <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md) of
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p2.3"></span>Apollo, were thrown from a bridge
into the Tiber. And the Carthaginians not only offered infants to the
same <span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p2.4"></span>Saturnus; but being
conquered by the Sicilians, to make an expiation, they immolated two
hundred sons of nobles. And not more mild than these are those offerings
which are even now made to the Great Mother and to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p2.5"></span>Bellona, in which the priests make an
offering, not with the blood of others, but with their own blood; when,
mutilating themselves, they cease to be men, and yet do not pass over to
the women; or, cutting their shoulders, they sprinkle the loathsome
altars with their own blood. But these things are cruel.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3"></span>Let us come to those which are
mild. The sacred rites of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.1"></span>Isis
show nothing else than the manner in which she lost and found her little
son, who is called <span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.2"></span>Osiris. For
first her priests and attendants, having shaved all their limbs, and
beating their breasts, howl, lament, and search, imitating the manner in
which his mother was affected; afterwards the boy is found by <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.3"></span>Cynocephalus. Thus the mournful rites
are ended with gladness. The mystery of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.4"></span>Ceres also resembles these, in which
torches are lighted, and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.5"></span>Proserpine is sought for through the
night; and when she has been found, the whole rite is finished with
congratulations and the throwing about of torches. The people of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.6"></span>Lampsacus, offer an ass to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p3.7"></span>Priapus as an appropriate victim. <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) Lindus is a town of Rhodes, where
sacred rites in honour of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.2"></span>Hercules are celebrated with revilings.
For when <span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.3"></span>Hercules had taken away
his oxen from a ploughman, and had slain them, he avenged his injury by
taunts; and afterwards having been himself appointed priest, it was
ordained that he himself, and other priests after him, should celebrate
sacrifices with the same revilings. But the mystery of the Cretan <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.4"></span>Jupiter represents the manner in which
he was withdrawn from his father, or brought up. The goat is beside him,
by the teats of which <span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.5"></span>Amalthea
nourished the boy. The sacred rites of the mother of the gods also show
the same thing. For because the Corybantes then drowned the cry of the
boy by the tinkling of their helmets and the striking of their shields,
a representation of this circumstance is now repeated in the sacred
rites; but cymbals are beaten instead of helmets, and drums instead of
shields, that <span id="iii.ii.viii.xix-p4.6"></span>Saturnus may not
hear the cries of the boy.
