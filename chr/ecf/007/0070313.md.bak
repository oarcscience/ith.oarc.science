#### <span id="iii.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p1"></span>This long peace, <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md) however, was afterwards
interrupted. <span id="iii.v.iv-p2.1"></span>Decius appeared in the
world, an accursed wild beast, to afflict the Church,—and <span
id="iii.v.iv-p2.2"></span>who but a bad man would persecute religion? It
seems as if he had been raised to sovereign eminence, at once to rage
against God, and at once to fall; for, having undertaken an expedition
against the Carpi, who had then possessed themselves of Dacia and
Moefia, he was suddenly surrounded by the barbarians, and slain,
together with great part of his army; nor could he be honoured with the
rites of sepulture, but, stripped and naked, he lay to be devoured by
wild beasts and birds, <span id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md) —a fit
end for the enemy of God.
