<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p1"></span>(Thus baptize ye, p. 379.)  

<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p2"></span><span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>If we compare this chapter with the
corresponding one in the <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p2.2"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions, the <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p2.3"></span>Teaching seems
to me to be a somewhat abridged form of a common original. This being
designed for the <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p2.4"></span>catechumens, there
is an omission of what they are afterwards to know. A form originally
drawn up for clergy and people has been very inartificially expurgated
for the instruction of young disciples. This appears from the ninth
chapter (p. 380), where only certain receptive or responsive forms are
given. The liturgy of the <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p2.5"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p2.6"></span>, book viii., embodies
what was studiously kept from all but the <span class="Greek"><span

id="viii.iii.xvii-p2.8"></span>́</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p2.9"></span>λειοι</span>, i.e., those “of full age.”

##### <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p3.1"></span>II

<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p4"></span>(Concerning Apostles, p. 380, note
16.)  

<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p5"></span>The reference to “apostles,” probably
itinerant, in [Rev. ii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002)<span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.1"></span>, corresponds with this. There were
officers known in the Apostolic day (compare [2 Cor. viii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023)<span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.2"></span>, <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.3"></span>Greek) <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.4"></span>as <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.5"></span>ἀπο</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.6"></span>́</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.7"></span>στολοι</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.8"></span>ἐκκλησιω</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.9"></span>̑</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.10"></span>ν</span>, for the <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.11"></span>pseud-apostles of the Apocalypse could
not have pretended what they did had it been otherwise. Neither would it
have been needful to “<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p5.12"></span>try those
who said they were apostles,” in that case: the mere assertion of such a
pretence would have sufficiently convicted them.  

<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p6"></span>The very childish directions (suited
to mere <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p6.1"></span>catechumens) given in the
text illustrates [Rev ii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002)<span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p6.2"></span>, and is, so far, evidence of the very
early origin of the <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p6.3"></span>Teaching.  

<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p7"></span>The name <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p7.1"></span>apostles was made <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p7.2"></span>technical by Christ Himself: “He <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p7.3"></span>named them Apostles” ([Luke vi.
13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013)<span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p7.4"></span>). And the word is never used in the
loose way which Bishop <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p7.5"></span>Lightfoot
hazardously suggests, as I must venture to believe.  

##### <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p7.6"></span>III

<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p8"></span>(Incipient fanaticism, p. 381, note
25.)  

<span id="viii.iii.xvii-p9"></span>Unquestionably, for even in St. <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p9.1"></span>Paul’s day his admonitions imply nothing
less. See <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p9.2"></span>1 Cor. cap. xiv., <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p9.3"></span>passim. But, as in the Introductory
Notice <span id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520) I hinted my suspicions
of incipient Montanism in the <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p10.2"></span>Teaching, so I am strengthened in this
idea by the learned critic to whose note I venture to append this remark
for the purpose of asking a reference to my annotations of <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p10.3"></span>Hermas in vol. ii. of this series. May I
also ask a reference to the same volume, pp. 4, 5, and 6? The “meal”
(note 23, p. 380) of the <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p10.6"></span>Teaching
is doubtless the <span id="viii.iii.xvii-p10.7"></span>Agape, which had
been abused at so early a day, that St. <span
id="viii.iii.xvii-p10.8"></span>Peter <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521) himself was forced to denounce the
“false prophets” who polluted this feast of charity. <span
