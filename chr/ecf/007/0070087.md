#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Chap. V.—The Oracles of the Prophets Must Be Looked Into; And of Their Times, and the Times of the Judges and Kings.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p1"></span>Now, since I have shown that wisdom and
religion cannot be separated, it remains that we speak of religion
itself, and wisdom. I am aware, indeed, how difficult it is to discuss
heavenly subjects; but still the attempt must be ventured, that the
truth may be made clear and brought to light, and that many may be freed
from error and death, who despise and refuse the truth, while it is
concealed under a covering of folly. But before I begin to speak of God
and His works, I must first speak a few things concerning the prophets,
whose testimony I must now use, which I have refrained from doing in the
former books. Above all things, he who desires to comprehend the truth
ought not only to apply his mind to understand the utterances of the
prophets, but also most diligently to inquire into the times during
which each one of them existed, that he may know what future events they
predicted, and after how many years their predictions were
fulfilled. <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515) Nor is there any
difficulty in making these computations; for they testified under what
king each of them received the inspiration of the Divine Spirit. And
many have written and published books respecting the times, making their
commencement from the prophet <span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p2.4"></span>Moses,
who lived about seven hundred years before the Trojan war. But he, when
he had governed the people for forty years, was succeeded by <span
id="iii.ii.iv.v-p2.5"></span>Joshua, who held the chief place
twenty-seven years.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p3"></span>After this they were under the
government of judges during <span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p3.1"></span>three
hundred and seventy years. <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.v-Page_105"></span>Then their condition was changed, and
they began to have kings; and when they had ruled during<span
id="iii.ii.iv.v-p3.2"></span> four hundred and fifty years, until the
reign of <span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p3.3"></span>Zedekiah, the Jews having
been besieged by the king of Babylon, and carried into captivity, <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516) endured a long servitude, until, in
the seventieth year afterwards, the captive Jews were restored to their
own lands and settlements by <span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p4.3"></span>Cyrus
the elder, who attained the supreme power over the Persians, at the time
when <span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p4.4"></span>Tarquinius Superbus reigned at
Rome. Wherefore, since the whole series of times may be collected both
from the Jewish histories and from those of the Greeks and Romans, the
times of the prophets individually may also be collected; the last of
whom was <span id="iii.ii.iv.v-p4.5"></span>Zechariah, and it is agreed
on that he prophesied in the time of King <span
id="iii.ii.iv.v-p4.6"></span>Darius, in the second year of his reign,
and in the eighth month. Of so much greater antiquity <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517) are the prophets found to be than the
Greek writers. And I bring forward all these things, that they may
perceive their error who endeavour to refute Holy Scripture, as though
it were new and recently composed, being ignorant from what fountain the
origin of our holy religion flowed. But if any one, having put together
and examined the times, shall duly lay the foundation of learning, and
fully ascertain the truth, he will also lay aside his error when he has
gained the knowledge of the truth.
