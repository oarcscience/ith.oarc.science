#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVI.—That Demons Have No Power Over Those Who are Established in the Faith.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p1"></span>And the nature of all these
deceits <span id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) is obscure to those who
are without the truth. For they think that those demons profit them when
they cease to injure, whereas they have no power except to injure. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) Some one may perchance say that they
are therefore to be worshipped, that they may not injure, since they
have the power to injure. They do indeed injure, but those only by whom
they are feared, whom the powerful and lofty hand of God does not
protect, who are <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-Page_65"></span>uninitiated in the mystery <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) of truth. But they fear the
righteous, <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) that is, the
worshippers of God, adjured by whose name they depart <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) from the bodies <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p6.4"></span>of the possessed: for, being lashed by
their words as though by scourges, they not only confess themselves to
be demons, but even utter their own names—those which are adored in the
temples—which they generally do in the presence of their own
worshippers; not, it is plain, to the disgrace of religion, but <span
id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p7.3"></span>to the disgrace of their own honour,
because they cannot speak falsely to God, by whom they are adjured, nor
to the righteous, by whose voice they are tortured. Therefore ofttimes
having uttered the greatest howlings, they cry out that they are beaten,
and are on fire, and that they are just on the point of coming forth: so
much power has the knowledge of God, and righteousness! Whom, therefore,
can they injure, except those whom they have in their own power? In
short, Hermes affirms that those who have known God are not only safe
from the attacks of demons, but that they are not even bound by fate.
“The only protection,” he says, “is piety, for over a pious man neither
evil demon nor fate has any power: for God rescues the pious man from
all evil; for the one and only good thing among men is piety.” And what
piety is, he testifies in another place, in these words: “For piety is
the knowledge of God.” <span id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p7.4"></span>Asclepius
also, his disciple, more fully expressed the same sentiment in that
finished discourse which he wrote to the king. Each of them, in truth,
affirms that the demons are the enemies and harassers of men, and on
this account <span id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p7.5"></span>Trismegistus calls
them wicked angels; so far was he from being ignorant that from heavenly
beings they were corrupted, and began to be earthly.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p5"></span> See Acts of Apostles xvi. 18, and
xix. 15, 16. In the Gospels the demons say to <span

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p6"></span> The practise of exorcism was used in
the early ages of the Church, and the faithful were supposed to possess
power over demons. See book iv. ch. 27. <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p6.1"></span>Justin, <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xvi-p6.2"></span>Tertullian and other writers attest the
same. There were also exorcists in the Jewish synagogues. See [Acts xix.

brings out the meaning more distinctly by contrast = they did not
disgrace religion, but their own honour.
