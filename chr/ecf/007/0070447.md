#### <span id="ix.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Sec. II.—On Domestic and Social Life.

##### <span id="ix.v.ii-p0.2"></span>Of Parents and Children.

<span id="ix.v.ii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.v.ii-p1.1"></span>XI.</span> Ye fathers, educate your children in
the Lord, bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;
and teach them such trades as are agreeable and suitable to the word,
lest <span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span
id="ix.v.ii-Page_436"></span>they by such opportunity become
extravagant, and continue without punishment from their parents, and so
get relaxation before their time, and go astray from that which is good.
Wherefore be not afraid to reprove them, and to teach them wisdom with
severity. For your corrections will not kill them, but rather preserve
them. As Solomon says somewhere in the book of Wisdom: “Chasten thy son,
and he will refresh thee; so wilt thou have good hope of him. Thou
verily shalt smite him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from
death.” <span id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957) And again, says the
same Solomon thus, “He that spareth his rod, hateth his son;” <span
id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958) and afterwards, “Beat his sides
whilst he is an infant, lest he be hardened and disobey thee.” <span
id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959) He, therefore, that neglects to
admonish and instruct his own son, hates his own child. Do you therefore
teach your children the word of the Lord. Bring them under with cutting
stripes, and make them subject from their infancy, teaching them the
Holy Scriptures, which are Christian and divine, and delivering to them
every sacred writing, “not giving them such liberty that they get the
mastery,” <span id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960) and act against
your opinion, not permitting them to club together for a treat with
their equals. For so they will be turned to disorderly courses, and will
fall into fornication; and if this happen by the carelessness of their
parents, those that begat them will be guilty of their souls. For if the
offending children get into the company of debauched persons by the
negligence of those that begat them, they will not be punished alone by
themselves; but their parents also will be condemned on their account.
For this cause endeavour, at the time when they are of an age fit for
marriage, to join them in wedlock, and settle them together, lest in the
heat and fervour of their age their course of life become dissolute, and
you be required to give an account by the Lord God in the day of
judgment.  

##### <span id="ix.v.ii-p5.2"></span>Of Servants and Masters.

<span id="ix.v.ii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.v.ii-p6.1"></span>XII</span>. But as to servants, what can we say
more than that the slave bring a good will to his master, with the fear
of God, although he be impious and wicked, <span
id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961) but yet not to yield any compliance
as to his worship? And let the master love his servant, although he be
his superior. Let him consider wherein they are equal, even as he is a
man. And let him that has a believing master <span
id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962) love him both as his master, and as
of the same faith, and as a father, but still with the preservation of
his authority as his master: “not as an eye-servant, but as a lover of
his master; as knowing that God will recompense to him for his
subjection.” <span id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963) In like manner,
let a master who has a believing servant love him as a son or as a
brother, on account of their communion in the faith, but still
preserving the difference of a servant.  

##### <span id="ix.v.ii-p9.4"></span>In What Things We Ought to Be Subject to the Rulers of This World.

<span id="ix.v.ii-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.v.ii-p10.1"></span>XIII</span>. Be ye subject to all royal power
and dominion in things which are pleasing to God, as to the ministers of
God, and the punishers of the ungodly. <span
id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964) Render all the fear that is due to
them, all offerings, all customs, all honour, gifts, and taxes. <span
id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965) For this is God’s command, that you
owe nothing to any one but the pledge of love, which God has commanded
by Christ. <span id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966)  

##### <span id="ix.v.ii-p13.3"></span>Of Virgins.

<span id="ix.v.ii-p14"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.v.ii-p14.1"></span>XIV</span>. Concerning virginity we have
received no commandment; <span id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967) but
we leave it to the power of those that are willing, as a vow: exhorting
them so far in this matter that they do not promise anything rashly;
since Solomon says, “It is better not to vow, than to vow and not
pay.” <span id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968) Let such a virgin,
therefore, be holy in body and soul, as the temple of God, <span
id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969) as the house of Christ, as the
habitation of the Holy Spirit. For she that vows ought to do such works
as are suitable to her vow; and to show that her vow is real, and made
on account of leisure for piety, not to cast a reproach on marriage. Let
her not be a gadder abroad, nor one that rambles about unseasonably; not
double-minded, but grave, continent, sober, pure, avoiding the
conversation of many, and especially of those that are of ill
reputation. <span id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970)
