#### <span id="iii.v.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXV.

<span id="iii.v.xxxv-p1"></span>This edict was promulgated at Nicomedia
on the day preceding the kalends of May, <span
id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986) in the eighth consulship of <span
id="iii.v.xxxv-p2.1"></span>Galerius, and the second of <span
id="iii.v.xxxv-p2.2"></span>Maximin Daia. Then the prison-gates having
been thrown open, you, my best beloved <span
id="iii.v.xxxv-p2.3"></span>Donatus, <span
id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987) together with the other confessors
for the faith, were set at liberty from a jail, which had been your
residence for six years. <span id="iii.v.xxxv-p3.5"></span>Galerius,
however, did not, by publication of this edict, obtain the divine
forgiveness. In a few days after he was consumed by the horrible disease
that had brought on an universal putrefaction. Dying, he recommended his
wife and son to <span id="iii.v.xxxv-p3.6"></span>Licinius, and
delivered them over into his hands. This event was known at Nicomedia
before the end of the month. <span id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988)
His vicennial anniversary was to have been celebrated on the ensuing
kalends of March. <span id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989)
