#### <span id="iii.v.xliii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLIII.

<span id="iii.v.xliii-p1"></span>Of the adversaries of God there still
remained one, whose overthrow and end I am now to relate.  

<span id="iii.v.xliii-p2"></span><span id="iii.v.xliii-p2.1"></span>Daia
had entertained jealousy and ill-will against <span
id="iii.v.xliii-p2.2"></span>Licinius from the time that the preference
was given to him by <span id="iii.v.xliii-p2.3"></span>Galerius; and
those sentiments still subsisted, notwithstanding the treaty of peace
lately concluded between them. When <span
id="iii.v.xliii-p2.4"></span>Daia heard that the sister of <span
id="iii.v.xliii-p2.5"></span>Constantine was betrothed to <span
id="iii.v.xliii-p2.6"></span>Licinius, he apprehended that the two
emperors, by contracting this affinity, meant to league against him; so
he privily sent ambassadors to Rome, desiring a friendly alliance with
<span id="iii.v.xliii-p2.7"></span>Maxentius: he also wrote to him in
terms of cordiality. The ambassadors were received courteously,
friendship established, and in token of it the effigies of <span
id="iii.v.xliii-p2.8"></span>Maxentius and <span
id="iii.v.xliii-p2.9"></span>Daia were placed together in public view.
<span id="iii.v.xliii-p2.10"></span>Maxentius willingly embraced this,
as if it had been an aid from heaven; for he had already declared war
against <span id="iii.v.xliii-p2.11"></span>Constantine, as if to
revenge the death of his father <span
id="iii.v.xliii-p2.12"></span>Maximian. From this appearance of filial
piety a suspicion arose, that the detestable old man had but feigned a
quarrel with his son that he might have an opportunity to destroy his
rivals in power, and so make way for himself and his son to possess the
whole empire. This conjecture, however, had no foundation; for his true
purpose was to have destroyed his son and the others, and then to have
reinstated himself and <span id="iii.v.xliii-p2.13"></span>Diocletian in
sovereign authority.
