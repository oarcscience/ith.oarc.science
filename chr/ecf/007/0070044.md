#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIV.—Of Noah the Inventor of Wine, Who First Had Knowledge of the Stars, and of the Origin of False Religions.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p1"></span>But afterwards God, when He saw the
earth filled with wickedness and crimes, determined to destroy mankind
with a deluge; but, however, for renewing the multitude, He chose one
man, who, <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) when all were
corrupted, stood forth pre-eminent, as a remarkable example of
righteousness. He, when six hundred years old, built an ark, as God had
commanded him, in which he himself was saved, together with his wife and
three sons, and as many daughters-in-law, when the water had covered all
the loftiest mountains. Then when the earth was dry, God, execrating the
wickedness of the former age, that the length of life might not again be
a cause of meditating evils, gradually diminished the age of man by each
successive generation, and placed a limit at a hundred and twenty
years, <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) which it might not be
permitted to exceed. But he, when he went forth from the ark, as the
sacred writings inform us, diligently cultivated the earth, and planted
a vineyard with his own hand. From which circumstance they are refuted
who regard <span id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.7"></span>Bacchus as the author of
wine. For he not only preceded <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.8"></span>Bacchus, but also <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.9"></span>Saturn and <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.10"></span>Uranus, by many generations. And when he
had first taken the fruit from the vineyard, having become merry, he
drank even to intoxication, and lay naked. And when one of his sons,
whose name was <span id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.11"></span>Cham, <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) had seen this, he did not cover his
father’s nakedness, but went out and told the circumstance to his
brothers also. But they, having taken a garment, entered with their
faces turned backwards, and covered their father. <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) And when their father became aware of
what had been done he disowned and sent away his son. But he went into
exile, and settled in a part of that land which is now called Arabia;
and that land was called from him Chanaan, and his posterity
Chanaanites. This was the first nation which was ignorant of God, since
its prince and founder did not receive from his father the worship of
God, being cursed by him; <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) and
thus he left to his descendants ignorance of the divine nature. <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p8"></span>From this nation all the nearest
people flowed as the multitude increased. But the descendants of his
father were called Hebrews, among whom the religion of the true God was
established. <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) But from these also
in after times, when their number was multiplied exceedingly, since the
small extent of their settlements could not contain them, then young
men, either sent by their parents or of their own accord, by the
compulsion of poverty, leaving their own lands to seek for themselves
new settlements, were scattered in all directions, and filled all the
islands and the whole earth; and thus being torn away from the stem of
their sacred root, they established for themselves at their own
discretion new customs and institutions. But they who occupied Egypt
were the first of all who began to look up to and adore the heavenly
bodies. And because they did not shelter themselves in houses on account
of the quality of the atmosphere, and the heaven is not overspread with
any clouds in that country, they observed the courses of the stars, and
their obscurations, <span id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) while in
their frequent adorations they more carefully and freely beheld them.
Then afterwards, induced by certain prodigies, they invented monstrous
figures of animals, that they might worship them; the authors of which
we will presently disclose. But the others, who were scattered over the
earth, admiring the elements of the world, began to worship the heaven,
the sun, the earth, the sea, without any images and temples, and offered
sacrifices to them in the open air, until in process of time they
erected temples and statues to the most powerful kings, and originated
the practice of honouring them with victims and odours; and thus
wandering from the knowledge of God, they began to be heathens. They
err, therefore, who contend that the worship of the gods was from the
beginning of the world, and that heathenism was prior to the religion of
God: for they think that this was discovered afterwards, because they
are ignorant of the source and origin of the truth. Now let us return to
the beginning of the world. <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span

id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.1"></span>Lactantius understands the hundred and
twenty years (mentioned [Gen. vi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.2"></span>) as the limit of human life, and regards
it as a mark of severity on God’s part. But <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.3"></span>Chrysostom, <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.4"></span>Jerome, <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.5"></span>Augustine, and most commentators, regard
it rather as a sign of God’s patience and long-suffering, in giving them
that space for repentance. And this appears to be confirmed by the
Apostle <span id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p3.6"></span>Peter, 1 Ep. iii. 20, “When
once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark
was a preparing.”

denunciation of divine judgment on the impiety of Ham, which Noah, by
the suggestion of the Holy Spirit, uttered against the posterity of the
profane man. [Gen. ix. 25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md)<span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p6.1"></span>: “Cursed be Canaan.” The curse was not
uttered in a spirit of vengeance or impatience on account of the injury
received, but by the prophetic impulse of the Divine Spirit. \[The
prophet fixes on the descendant of Ham, whose <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p6.2"></span>impiety was foreseen, and to whom <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xiv-p6.3"></span>it brought a curse so signal.\]

but wilful ignorance and idolatry wrought the curse, which was merely
foretold, not fore-ordained.\]
