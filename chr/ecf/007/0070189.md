#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXV.—Of the Last Times, and of the City of Rome.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxv-p1"></span>These are the things which are
spoken of by the prophets as about to happen hereafter: but I have not
considered it necessary to bring forward their testimonies and words,
since it would be an endless task; nor would the limits of my book
receive so great a multitude of subjects, since so many with one breath
speak similar things; and at the same time, lest weariness should be
occasioned to the readers if I should heap together things collected and
transferred from all; moreover, that I might confirm those very things
which I said, not by my own writings, but in an especial manner by the
writings of others, and might show that not only among us, but even with
those very persons who revile us, the truth is preserved, <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425) which they refuse to
acknowledge. <span id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426) But he who
wishes to know these things more accurately may draw from the fountain
itself, and he will know more things worthy of admiration than we have
comprised in these books. Perhaps some one may now ask when these things
of which we have spoken are about to come to pass? I have already shown
above, that when six thousand years shall be completed this change must
take place, and that the last day of the extreme conclusion is now
drawing near. It is permitted us to know respecting the signs, which are
spoken by the prophets, for they foretold signs by which the
consummation of the times is to be expected by us from day to day, and
to be feared. When, however, this amount will be completed, those teach,
who have written respecting the times, collecting them from the sacred
writings and from various histories, how great is the number of years
from the beginning of the world. And although they vary, and the amount
of the number as reckoned by them differs considerably, yet all
expectation does not exceed the limit of two hundred years. The subject
itself declares that the fall and ruin of the world will shortly take
place; except that while the city of Rome remains it appears that
nothing of this kind is to be feared. <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427) But when that capital of the world
shall have fallen, and shall have begun to be a street, <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428) which the Sibyls say shall come to
pass, who can doubt that the end has now arrived to the affairs of men
and the whole world? It is that city, that only, which still sustains
all things; and the God of heaven is to be entreated by us and
implored—if, indeed, His arrangements and decrees can be delayed—lest,
sooner than we think for, that detestable tyrant should come who will
undertake so great a deed, and dig out that eye, by the destruction of
which the world itself is about to fall. Now let us return, to set forth
the other things which are then about to follow.
