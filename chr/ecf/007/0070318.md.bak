#### <span id="iii.v.ix-p0.1"></span>Chap. IX.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p1"></span>But the other <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Maximian (<span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.2"></span>Galerius), chosen by <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.3"></span>Diocletian for his son-in-law, was worse, not
only than those two princes whom our own times have experienced, but
worse than all the bad princes of former days. In this wild beast there
dwelt a native barbarity and a savageness foreign to Roman blood; and no
wonder, for his mother was born beyond the Danube, and it was an inroad
of the Carpi that obliged her to cross over and take refuge in New
Dacia. The form of <span id="iii.v.ix-p1.4"></span>Galerius corresponded
with his manners. Of stature tall, full of flesh, and swollen to a
horrible bulk of corpulency; by his speech, gestures, and looks, he made
himself a terror to all that came near him. His father-in-law, too,
dreaded him excessively. The cause was this. <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.5"></span>Narseus, king of the Persians, emulating the
example set him by his grandfather <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.6"></span>Sapores, assembled a great army, and aimed at
becoming master of the eastern provinces of the Roman empire. <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.7"></span>Diocletian, apt to be low-spirited and
timorous in every commotion, and fearing a fate like that of <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.8"></span>Valerian, would not in person encounter <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.9"></span>Narseus; but he sent <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.10"></span>Galerius by the way of Armenia, while he
himself halted in the eastern provinces, and anxiously watched the
event. It is a custom amongst the barbarians to take everything that
belongs to them into the field. <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.11"></span>Galerius laid an ambush for them, and easily
overthrew men embarrassed with the multitude of their followers and with
their baggage. Having put <span id="iii.v.ix-p1.12"></span>Narseus to
flight, and returned with much spoil, his own pride and <span
id="iii.v.ix-p1.13"></span>Diocletian’s fears were greatly increased.
For after this victory he rose to such a pitch of haughtiness as to
reject the appellation of Cæsar; <span
id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md) and when he heard that appellation
in letters addressed to him, he cried out, with a stern look and
terrible voice, “How long am I to be <span
id="iii.v.ix-p2.2"></span>Cæsar? “Then he began to act extravagantly,
insomuch that, as if he had been a second <span
id="iii.v.ix-p2.3"></span>Romulus, he wished to pass for and to be
called the offspring of <span id="iii.v.ix-p2.4"></span>Mars; and that
he might appear the issue of a divinity, he was willing that his mother
<span id="iii.v.ix-p2.5"></span>Romula should be dishonoured with the
name of adulteress. But, not to confound the chronological order of
events, I delay the recital of his actions; for indeed afterwards, when
<span id="iii.v.ix-p2.6"></span>Galerius got the title of emperor, his
father-in-law having been divested of the imperial purple, he became
altogether outrageous, and of unbounded arrogance.  

<span id="iii.v.ix-p3"></span>While by such a conduct, and with such
associates, <span id="iii.v.ix-p3.1"></span>Diocles—for <span
id="iii.v.ix-p3.2"></span>that was the name of <span
id="iii.v.ix-p3.3"></span>Diocletian before he attained
sovereignty—occupied himself in subverting the commonweal, there was no
evil which his crimes did not deserve: nevertheless he reigned most
prosperously, as long as he forbore to defile his hands with the blood
of the just; and what cause he had for persecuting them, I come now to
explain.
