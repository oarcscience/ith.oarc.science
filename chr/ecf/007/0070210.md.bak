#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXII.—Of the Sacred Rites Introduced by Faunus and Numa.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Faunas was the first in Latium who
introduced these follies, who both instituted bloody sacrifices to his
grandfather <span id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.2"></span>Saturnus, and
wished that his father <span id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.3"></span>Picus
should be worshipped as a god, and placed <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.4"></span>Fatua Fauna his wife and sister among
the gods, and named her the good goddess. Then at Rome, <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.5"></span>Numa, who burthened those rude and
rustic then with new superstitions, instituted priesthoods, and
distributed the gods into families and nations, that he might call off
the fierce spirits of the people from the pursuits of arms. Therefore
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.6"></span>Lucilius, in deriding the folly
of those who are slaves to vain superstitions, introduced these verses:—
 

> <span id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p1.7"></span> “Those bugbears <span
> id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) the Lamiæ, which <span
> id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p2.6"></span>Faunus and <span
> id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p2.7"></span>Numa Pompilius and others
> instituted, at these he trembles; he places everything in this. As
> infant boys believe that every statue of bronze is a living man, so
> these imagine that all things reigned are true: they believe that
> statues of bronze contain a heart. It is a painter’s <span
> id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) gallery; nothing is real,
> everything fictitious.”  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p4"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.xviii-p4.1"></span>Tullius also, writing of the nature
of the gods, complains that false and fictitious gods have been
introduced, and that from thus source have arisen false opinions, and
turbulent errors, and almost old womanly superstitions, which opinion
ought in comparison <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md) with
others to be esteemed more weighty, because these things were spoken by
one who was both a philosopher and a priest.
