#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p0.1"></span>Chap. LXXIII.—The Hope of Safety is in the Religion and Worship of God.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1"></span>Wherefore, since all these things
are true and certain, in harmony with the predicted announcement of the
prophets, since <span id="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.1"></span>Trismegistus and
<span id="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.2"></span>Hystaspes and the <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lxix-p1.3"></span>Sibyls have foretold the same things,
it cannot be doubted that all hope of life and salvation is placed in
the religion of God alone. Therefore, unless a man shall have received
Christ, whom God has sent, and is about to send for our redemption,
unless he shall have known the Supreme God through Christ, unless he
shall have kept His commandments and law, he will fall into those
punishments of which we have spoken. Therefore frail things must be
despised, that we may gain those which are substantial; earthly things
must be scorned, that we may be honoured with heavenly things; temporal
things must be shunned, that we may reach those which are eternal. Let
every one train himself to justice, mould himself to self-restraint,
prepare himself for the contest, equip himself for virtue, that if by
any chance an adversary shall wage war, he may be driven from that which
is upright and good by no force, no terror, and no tortures, may
give <span id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) himself up to no
senseless fictions, but in his uprightness acknowledge the true and only
God, may cast away pleasures, by the attractions of which the lofty soul
is depressed to the earth, may hold fast innocency, may be of service to
as many as possible, may gain for himself incorruptible treasures by
good works, that he may be able, with God for his judge, to gain for the
merits of his virtue either the crown of faith, or the reward of
immortality.
