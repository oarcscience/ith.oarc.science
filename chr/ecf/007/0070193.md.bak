#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.i-p0.1"></span>The Preface.—The Plan and Purport of the Whole Epitome, <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) And of the Institutions.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii.viii.i-p2.1"></span>Although</span> the books of the <span
id="iii.ii.viii.i-p2.2"></span>Divine Institutions which we wrote a long
time since to illustrate the truth and religion, may so prepare and
mould the minds of the readers, that their length may not produce
disgust, nor their copiousness be burthensome; nevertheless you desire,
O brother <span id="iii.ii.viii.i-p2.3"></span>Pentadius, that an
epitome of them should be made for you, I suppose for this reason, that
I may write something to you, and that your name may be rendered famous
by my work, such as it is. I will comply with your desire, although it
seems a difficult matter to comprise within the compass of one book
those things which have been treated of in seven large volumes. <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) For the whole matter becomes less
full when so great a multitude of subjects is to be compressed within a
narrow space; and it becomes less clear by its very brevity, especially
since many arguments and examples, on which the elucidation of the
proofs depends, must of necessity be omitted, since their copiousness is
so great, that even by themselves they are enough to make up a book. And
when these are removed, what can appear useful, what plain? But I will
strive as much as the subject permits, both to contract that which is
diffuse and to shorten that which is long; in such a manner, however,
that in this work, in which truth is to be brought to light, matter may
not seem to be wanting for copiousness, nor clearness for understanding
it. <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md)
