#### <span id="viii.ii.i-p0.1"></span>section 1.—the discovery of the codex, and its contents.

<span id="viii.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>In 1873
<span id="viii.ii.i-p1.2"></span>Philotheos Bryennios, then Head Master
of the higher Greek school at Constantinople, but now Metropolitan of
Nicomedia, discovered a remarkable collection of manuscripts in the
library of the Jerusalem Monastery of the Most Holy Sepulchre at
Constantinople. This collection is bound in one volume, and written by
the same hand. It is signed “Leon, notary and sinner,” and bears the
Greek date of 6564 = <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.ii.i-p1.3"></span>a.d.</span> 1056. There is no reason to doubt
the age of the manuscripts. The documents have been examined by
Professor <span id="viii.ii.i-p1.4"></span>Albert L. Long of Robert
College, Constantinople; <span id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357) and
some of the pages, reproduced by photography, were published by the
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, April, 1885. The jealousy of its
guardians does not imply any lack of confidence in the age and value of
the Codex. The contents of the 120 folios (240 pp.) are as follows:—  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p3"></span>I.  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p4"></span>Synopsis of the Old and New Testaments,
by St. <span id="viii.ii.i-p4.1"></span>Chrysostom (fol. 1–32).  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p5"></span>II.  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p6"></span>The Epistle of <span
id="viii.ii.i-p6.1"></span>Barnabas (fol. 33–51<span
id="viii.ii.i-p6.2"></span>b).  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p7"></span>III.  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p8"></span>The two Epistles of <span
id="viii.ii.i-p8.1"></span>Clement to the Corinthians (fol. 51<span
id="viii.ii.i-p8.2"></span>b-76<span id="viii.ii.i-p8.3"></span>a).  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p9"></span>IV.  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p10"></span>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles
(fol. 76<span id="viii.ii.i-p10.1"></span>a-80).  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p11"></span>V.  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p12"></span>The Epistle of <span
id="viii.ii.i-p12.1"></span>Mary of Cassoboli to <span
id="viii.ii.i-p12.2"></span>Ignatius (fol. 81–82<span
id="viii.ii.i-p12.3"></span>a).  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p13"></span>VI.  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p14"></span>Twelve Epistles of <span
id="viii.ii.i-p14.1"></span>Ignatius (fol. 82<span
id="viii.ii.i-p14.2"></span>a-120<span id="viii.ii.i-p14.3"></span>a).  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p15"></span>The last part of fol. 120<span
id="viii.ii.i-p15.1"></span>a contains the signature and date; then
follows an account of the genealogy of <span
id="viii.ii.i-p15.2"></span>Joseph, continued on the other page of the
leaf.  

<span id="viii.ii.i-p16"></span><span id="viii.ii.i-p16.1"></span>Schaff
(p. 6) gives a facsimile of fol. 120<span id="viii.ii.i-p16.2"></span>a.
 

<span id="viii.ii.i-p17"></span>Of these, I. supplies some unpublished
portions, and furnishes matter for textual criticism. II. gives the
second Greek copy of <span id="viii.ii.i-p17.1"></span>Barnabas, also
furnishing new readings. III. is very valuable; the text of both
Epistles is now complete. Two-fifths of that of the second was
previously unknown. <span id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358) The value
for purposes of textual criticism is also great. IV. is the <span
id="viii.ii.i-p18.2"></span>Teaching, the value of which is discussed
below. V. and VI. both belong to the Ignatian literature, and furnish
new readings, which have already appeared in the editions of <span
id="viii.ii.i-p18.3"></span>Funk (<span
id="viii.ii.i-p18.4"></span>Opera Patr. Apost., ii., Tübingen, 1881) and
<span id="viii.ii.i-p18.5"></span>Lightfoot (<span
id="viii.ii.i-p18.6"></span>Epistles of St. Ignatius, London and
Cambridge, 1885).
