#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chap. I.—Of the Divine Providence.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.ii-p1"></span>First a question arises: Whether
there is any providence which made or governs the world? That there is,
no one doubts, since of almost all the philosophers, except the school
of <span id="iii.ii.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>Epicurus, there is but one
voice and one opinion, that the world could not have been made without a
contriver, and that it cannot exist without a ruler. Therefore <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ii-p1.2"></span>Epicurus is refuted not only by the most
learned men, but also by the testimonies and perceptions of all mortals.
For who can doubt respecting a providence, when he sees that the heavens
and the earth have been so arranged and that all things have been so
regulated, that they might be most befittingly adapted, not only to
wonderful beauty and adornment, but also to the use of men, and the
convenience of the other living creatures? That, therefore, which exists
in accordance with a plan, cannot have had its beginning without a plan:
thus <span id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447) it is certain that there
is a providence.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.ii-p2"></span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ii-p2.1"></span>Quoniam. This word appears to be out of
place, as its proper meaning is “since.” Either it must be taken as
above, or, with some editors, the last clause of this chapter may be
taken as the beginning of the next chapter—“Since there is a
providence,” etc.
