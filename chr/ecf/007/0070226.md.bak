#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXVIII.—Of Plato, Whose Doctrine Approaches More Nearly to the Truth.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiv-p1"></span>His disciple <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Plato, whom <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiv-p1.2"></span>Tully speaks of as the god of
philosophers, alone of all so studied philosophy that he approached
nearer to the truth; and yet, because he was ignorant of God, he so
failed in many things, that no one fell into worse errors, especially
because in his books respecting the state he wished all things to be
common to all. This is endurable concerning property, though it is
unjust. For it ought not to be an injury to any one, if he possesses
more than another through his own industry; or to be a profit to any
one, if through his own fault he possesses less. But, as I have said,
this is capable of being endured in some way. Shall there be a community
<span id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiv-Page_237"></span>of wives also, and of children?
Shall there be no distinction of blood, or certainty of race? Shall
there be neither families, nor relationships, nor affinities, but all
things confused and indiscriminate, as in herds of cattle? Shall there
be no self-restraint in men, no chastity in women? What conjugal
affection can there be in these, between whom on either side there is no
sure or peculiar <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) love? Who
will he dutiful towards a father, when he knows not from whom he was
born? Who will love a son, whom he will reckon as not his own? <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) Moreover, he opened <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) the senate house to women, and
entrusted to them warfare, magistracies, and commands. <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) But how great will be the calamity
of that city, in which women shall discharge the duties of men! But of
this more fully at another opportunity.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiv-p6"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiv-p6.1"></span>Zeno, the master of the Stoics, who
praises virtue, judged that pity, which is a very great virtue, should
be cut away, as though it were a disease of the mind, whereas it is at
the same time dear to God and necessary for men. For who is there who,
when placed in any evil, would be unwilling to be pitied, and would not
desire the assistance of those who might succour them, which is not
called forth so as to render aid, except by the feeling of pity?
Although he calls this humanity and piety, he does not change the matter
itself, only the name. This is the affection which has been given to man
alone, that by mutual assistance we might alleviate our weakness; and he
who removes this affection reduces us to the life of the beasts. For his
assertion that all faults are equal, proceeds from that inhumanity with
which also be assails pity as a disease. For he who makes no difference
in faults, either thinks that light offences ought to be visited with
severe punishments, which is the part of a cruel judge, or that great
offences should be visited with slight punishments, which is the part of
a worthless judge. In either case there is injury to the state. For if
the greatest crimes are lightly punished, the boldness of the wicked
will increase, and go on to deeds of greater daring; and if a punishment
of too great severity is inflicted for slight offences, inasmuch as no
one can be exempt from fault, many citizens will incur peril, who by
correction might become better.
