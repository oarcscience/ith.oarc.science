#### <span id="iii.ii.v.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIV.—Of the Divine Vengeance Inflicted on the Torturers of the Christians.

<span id="iii.ii.v.xxiv-p1"></span>Whatever, therefore, wicked princes
plan against us, God Himself permits to be done. And yet most unjust
persecutors, to whom the name of God was a subject of reproach and
mockery, must not think that they will escape with impunity, because
they have been, as it were, the ministers of His indignation against us.
For they will be punished with the judgment of God, who, having received
power, have abused it to an inhuman degree, and have even insulted God
in their arrogance, and placed His eternal name beneath their feet, to
be impiously and wickedly trampled upon. On this account He promises
that He will quickly take vengeance upon them, and exterminate the evil
monsters <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074) from the earth. But
He also, although He is accustomed to avenge the persecutions <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075) of His people even in the present
world, commands us, however, to await patiently that day of heavenly
judgment, in which He Himself will honour or punish every man according
to his deserts. Therefore let not the souls of the sacrilegious expect
that those whom they thus trample upon will be despised and unavenged.
Those ravenous and voracious wolves who have tormented just and innocent
souls, without the commission of any crimes, will surely meet with their
reward. Only let us labour, that nothing else in us may be punished by
men but righteousness alone: let us strive with all our power that we
may at once deserve at the hands of God the avenging of our suffering
and a reward.
