#### <span id="vi.ii.x-p1.1"></span>from the tenth chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.x-p2"></span><span id="vi.ii.x-p2.1"></span>1, 2. “I saw
another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and
a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and
his feet as pillars of fire: and he had in his hand an open book: and he
set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth.”\] He
signifies that that mighty angel who, he says, descended from heaven,
clothed with a cloud, is our Lord, as we have above narrated.  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p3"></span>“His face was as it were the sun.”\] That
is, with respect to the resurrection.  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p4"></span>“Upon his head was a rainbow.”\] He points
to the judgment which is executed by Him, or shall be.  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p5"></span>“An open book.”\] A revelation of works in
the future judgment, or the Apocalypse which <span
id="vi.ii.x-p5.1"></span>John received.  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p6"></span>“His feet,”\] as we have said above, are
the apostles. For that both things in sea and land are trodden under
foot by Him, signifies that all things are placed under His feet.
Moreover, he calls Him an angel, that is, a messenger, to wit, of the
Father; for He is called the Messenger of great counsel. He says also
that He cried with a loud voice. The great voice is to tell the words of
the Omnipotent God of heaven to men, and to bear witness that after
penitence is closed there will be no hope subsequently.  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p7"></span><span id="vi.ii.x-p7.1"></span>3. “Seven
thunders uttered their voices.”\] The seven thunders uttering their
voices signify the Holy Spirit of sevenfold power, who through the
prophets announced all things to come, and by His voice <span
id="vi.ii.x-p7.2"></span>John gave his testimony in the world; but
because he says that he was about to write the things which the thunders
had uttered, that is, whatever things had been obscure in the
announcements of the Old Testament; he is forbidden to write them, but
he was charged to leave them sealed, because he is an apostle, nor was
it fitting that the grace of the subsequent stage should be given in the
first. “The time,” says he, “is at hand.” <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) For the apostles, by powers, by
signs, by portents, and by mighty works, have overcome unbelief. After
them there is now given to the same completed Churches the comfort of
having the prophetic Scriptures subsequently interpreted, for I said
that after <span id="vi.ii.x-p8.3"></span>the apostles there would be
interpreting prophets.  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p9"></span>For the apostle says: “And he placed in the
Church indeed, first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly,
teachers,” <span id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) and the rest. And
in another place he says: “Let the prophets speak two or three, and let
the others judge.” <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) And he
says: “Every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered,
dishonoureth her head.” <span id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) And
when he says, “Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others
judge,” he is not speaking in respect of the Catholic prophecy of things
unheard and unknown, but of things both announced and known. But let
them judge whether or not the interpretation is consistent with the
testimonies of the prophetic utterance. <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) It is plain, therefore, that to
<span id="vi.ii.x-p13.2"></span>John, armed as he was with superior
virtue, this was not necessary, although the body of Christ, which is
the Church, adorned with His members, ought to respond to its position.
 

<span id="vi.ii.x-p14"></span><span id="vi.ii.x-p14.1"></span>10. “I
took the book from the hand of the angel, and ate it up.”\] To take the
book and eat it up, is, when exhibition of a thing is made to one, to
commit it to memory.  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p15"></span>“And it was in my mouth as sweet as
honey.”\] To be sweet in the mouth is the reward of the preaching of the
speaker, and is most pleasant to the hearers; but it is most bitter both
to those that announce it, and to those that persevere in its
commandments through suffering.  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p16"></span><span id="vi.ii.x-p16.1"></span>11. “And
He says unto me, Thou must again prophesy to the peoples, and to the
tongues, and to the nations, and to many kings.”\] He says this, because
when <span id="vi.ii.x-p16.2"></span>John said these things he was in
the island of Patmos, condemned to the labour of the mines by <span
id="vi.ii.x-p16.3"></span>Cæsar Domitian. There, therefore, he saw the
Apocalypse; and when grown old, he thought that he should at length
receive his quittance by suffering, <span
id="vi.ii.x-p16.4"></span>Domitian being killed, all his judgments were
discharged. And <span id="vi.ii.x-p16.5"></span>John being dismissed
from the mines, thus subsequently delivered the same Apocalypse which he
had received from God. This, therefore, is what He says: Thou must again
prophesy to all nations, because thou seest the crowds of Antichrist
rise up; and against them other crowds shall stand, and they shall fall
by the sword on the one side and on the other.
