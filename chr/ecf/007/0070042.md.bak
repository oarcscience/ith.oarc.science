#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XII.—That Animals Were Not Produced Spontaneously, But by a Divine Arrangement, of Which God Would Have Given Us the Knowledge, If It Were Advantageous for Us to Know It.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p1"></span>They say that at certain changes of
the heaven, and motions of the stars, there existed a kind of
maturity <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) for the production of
animals; and thus that the new earth, retaining the productive seed,
brought forth of itself certain vessels <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) after the likeness of wombs,
respecting which <span id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p3.1"></span>Lucretius <span
id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) says,—  

> <span id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p4.2"></span> “Wombs grew attached to the
> earth by roots;”  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p5"></span>and that these, when they had become
mature, being rent by the compulsion of nature, produced tender animals;
afterwards, that the earth itself abounded with a kind of moisture which
resembled milk, and that animals were supported by this nourishment.
How, then, were they able to endure or avoid the force of the cold or of
heat, or to be born at all, since the sun would scorch them or the cold
contract them? But, they say, at the beginning of the world there was no
winter nor summer, but a perpetual spring of an equable
temperature. <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) Why, then, do we
see that none of these things now happens? Because, they say, it was
necessary that it should once happen, that animals might be born; but
after they began to exist, and the power of generation was given to
them, the earth ceased to bring forth, and the condition of time <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) was changed. Oh, how easy it is to
refute falsehoods! In the first place, nothing can exist in this world
which does not continue permanent, as it began. For neither were the sun
and moon and stars then uncreated; nor, having been created, were they
without their motions; nor did that divine government, which manages and
rules their courses, fail to begin <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p7.1"></span>its exercise together with them. In the
next place, if it is as they say, there must of necessity be a
providence, and they fall into that very condition which they especially
avoid. For while the animals were yet unborn, it is plain that some one
provided that they should be born, that the world might not appear
gloomy <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) with waste and
desolation. But, that they might be produced from the earth without the
office of parents, provision must have been made with great judgment;
and in the next place, that the moisture condensed from the earth might
be formed into the various figures of bodies; and also that, having
received from the vessels with which they were covered the power of life
and sensation, they might be poured forth, as it were, from the womb of
mothers, is a wonderful and indescribable <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) provision. But let us suppose that
this also happened by chance; the circumstances which follow assuredly
cannot be by chance,—that the earth should at once flow with milk, and
that the temperature of the atmosphere should be equable. And if these
things plainly happened, that the newly born animals might have
nourishment, or be free from danger, it must be that some one provided
these things by some divine counsel.  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p10"></span>But who is able to make this
provision except God? Let us, however, see whether the circumstance
itself which they assert could have taken place, that men should be born
from the earth. If any one considers during how long a time and in what
manner an infant is reared, he will assuredly understand that those
earth-born children could not possibly have been reared without some one
to bring them up. For they must have lain for many months cast forth,
until their sinews were strengthened, so that they had power to move
themselves and to change their place, which can scarcely happen within
the space of one year. Now see whether an infant could have lain through
many months in the same manner and in the same place where it was cast
forth, without dying, overwhelmed and corrupted by that moisture of the
earth which it supplied for the sake of nourishment, and by the
excrements of its own body mixed together. Therefore it is impossible
but that it was reared by some one; unless, indeed, all animals are born
not in a tender condition, <span id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xii-Page_61"></span>but grown up: and it never came into
their mind to say this. Therefore the whole of that method is impossible
and vain; if that can be called method by which it is attempted that
there shall be no method. For he who says that all things are produced
of their own accord, and attributes nothing to divine providence, he
assuredly does not assert, but overthrows method. But if nothing can be
done or produced without design, it is plain that there is a divine
providence, to which that which is called design peculiarly belongs.
Therefore God, the Contriver of all things, made man. And even <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p10.1"></span>Cicero, though ignorant of the sacred
writings, saw this, who in his treatise on the Laws, in the first
book, <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) handed down the same thing
as the prophets; and I add his words: “This animal, foreseeing,
sagacious, various, acute, gifted with memory, full of method and
design, which we call man, was produced by the supreme Deity under
remarkable circumstances; for this alone of so many kinds and natures of
animals, partakes of judgment and reflection, when all other animals are
destitute of them.” Do you see that the man, although far removed from
the knowledge of the truth, yet, inasmuch as he held the image of
wisdom, understood that man could not be produced except by God? But,
however, there is need of divine <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md)
testimony, lest that of man should be insufficient. The <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p12.1"></span>Sibyl testifies that man is the work of
God:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p12.2"></span> “He who is the only God being
> the invincible Creator, He Himself fixed <span
> id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) the figure of the form of men, He
> Himself mixed the nature of all belonging to the generation of
> life.”  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xii-p14"></span>The sacred writings contain
statements to the same effect. Therefore God discharged the office of a
true father. He Himself formed the body; He Himself infused the soul
with which we breathe. Whatever we are, it is altogether His work. In
what manner He effected this He would have taught us, if it were right
for us to know; as He taught us other things, which have conveyed to us
the knowledge both of ancient error and of true light.
