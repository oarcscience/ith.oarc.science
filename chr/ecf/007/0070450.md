<span id="ix.vi.ii"></span>

#### <span id="ix.vi.ii-p0.1"></span>Sec. II.—All Association with Idols is to Be Avoided.

##### <span id="ix.vi.ii-p0.2"></span>A Moral Admonition, that We are to Abstain from Vain Talking, Obscene Talking, Jesting, Drunkenness, Lasciviousness, and Luxury.

<span id="ix.vi.ii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>X</span>. Now we exhort you, brethren and
fellow-servants, to avoid vain talk and obscene discourses, and
jestings, drunkenness, lasciviousness, luxury, unbounded passions, with
foolish discourses, since we do not permit you so much as on the Lord’s
days, which are days of joy, to speak or act anything unseemly; for the
Scripture somewhere says: “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice unto
Him with trembling.” <span id="fr_3041"></span>[3042](#fn_3041) Even
your very rejoicings therefore ought to be done with fear and trembling:
for a Christian who is faithful ought neither to repeat an heathen hymn
nor an obscene song, because he will be obliged by that hymn to make
mention of the idolatrous names of demons; and instead of the Holy
Spirit, the wicked one will enter into him.  

##### <span id="ix.vi.ii-p2.2"></span>An Admonition Instructing Men to Avoid the Abominable Sin of Idolatry.

<span id="ix.vi.ii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vi.ii-p3.1"></span>XI</span>. You are also forbidden to swear by
them, or to utter their abominable names through your mouth, and to
worship them, or fear them as gods; for they are not gods, but either
wicked demons or the ridiculous contrivances of men. For somewhere God
says concerning the Israelites: “They have forsaken me, and sworn by
them that are no gods.” <span id="fr_3042"></span>[3043](#fn_3042) And
afterwards: “I <span id="page_443">p. 443</span> <span
id="ix.vi.ii-Page_443"></span>will take away the names of your idols out
of their mouth.” <span id="fr_3043"></span>[3044](#fn_3043) And
elsewhere: “They have provoked me to jealousy with them that are no
gods; they have provoked me to anger with their idols.” <span
id="fr_3044"></span>[3045](#fn_3044) And in all the Scriptures these
things are forbidden by the Lord God.  

##### <span id="ix.vi.ii-p6.3"></span>That We Ought Not to Sing an Heathen or an Obscene Song, Nor to Swear by an Idol; Because It is an Impious Thing, and Contrary to the Knowledge of God.

<span id="ix.vi.ii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vi.ii-p7.1"></span>XII</span>. Nor do the legislators give us
only prohibitions concerning idols, but also warn us concerning the
luminaries, not to swear by them, nor to serve them. For they say:
“Lest, when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, thou
shouldest be seduced to worship them.” <span
id="fr_3045"></span>[3046](#fn_3045) And elsewhere: “Do not ye learn to
walk after the ways of the heathen, and be not afraid of the signs of
heaven.” <span id="fr_3046"></span>[3047](#fn_3046) For the stars and
the luminaries were given to men to shine upon them, but not for
worship; although the Israelites, by the perverseness of their temper,
“worshipped the creature instead of the Creator,” <span
id="fr_3047"></span>[3048](#fn_3047) and acted insultingly to their
Maker, and admired the creature more than is fit. And sometimes they
made a calf, as in the wilderness; <span
id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048) sometimes they worshipped <span
id="ix.vi.ii-p11.2"></span>Baalpeor; <span
id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049) another time <span
id="ix.vi.ii-p12.2"></span>Baal, <span
id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050) and <span
id="ix.vi.ii-p13.2"></span>Thamuz, <span
id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051) and <span
id="ix.vi.ii-p14.3"></span>Astarte of Sidon; <span
id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052) and again <span
id="ix.vi.ii-p15.2"></span>Moloch and <span
id="ix.vi.ii-p15.3"></span>Chamos; <span
id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053) another time the sun, <span
id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054) as it is written in Ezekiel; nay,
and besides, brute creatures, as among the Egyptians <span
id="ix.vi.ii-p17.2"></span>Apis, and the Mendesian goat, and gods of
silver and gold, as in Judea. On account of all which things He
threatened them, and said by the prophet: “Is it a small thing to the
house of Judah to do these abominations which they have done? For they
have filled the land with their wickedness, to provoke me to anger: and,
behold, they are as those that mock. And I will act with anger. Mine eye
shall not spare, neither will I have mercy; and they shall cry in mine
ears with a great voice, and I will not hearken unto them.” <span
id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055) Consider, beloved, how many things
the Lord declares against idolaters, and the worshippers of the sun and
moon. Wherefore it is the duty of a man of God, as he is a Christian,
not to swear by the sun, or by the moon, or by the stars; nor by the
heaven, nor by the earth, by any of the elements, whether small or
great. For if our Master charged us not to swear by the true God, that
our word might be firmer than an oath, nor by heaven itself, for that is
a piece of heathen wickedness, nor by Jerusalem, nor by the sanctuary of
God, nor the altar, nor the gift, nor the gilding of the altar, nor
one’s own head, <span id="fr_3056"></span>[3057](#fn_3056) for this
custom is a piece of Judaic corruption, and on that account was
forbidden; and if He exhorts the faithful that their yea be yea, and
their nay, nay, and says that “what is more than these is of the evil
one,” how much more blameable are those who appeal to deities falsely so
called as the objects of an oath, and who glorify imaginary beings
instead of those that are real, whom God for their perverseness
“delivered over to foolishness, to do those things that are not
convenient!” <span id="fr_3057"></span>[3058](#fn_3057)
