#### <span id="iii.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chap. III.—Of the Good and Evil Things in Human Affairs, and of Their Author.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p1"></span>First, no one ever said this respecting
God, that He is only subject to anger, and is not influenced by
kindness. For it is unsuitable to God, that He should be endowed with a
power of this kind, by which He may injure and do harm, but be unable to
profit and to do good. What means, therefore, what hope of safety, is
proposed to men, if God is the author of evils only? For if this is so,
that venerable majesty will now be drawn out, not to the power of the
judge, to whom it is permitted to preserve and set at liberty, but to
the office of the torturer and executioner. But whereas we see that
there are not only evils in human affairs, but also goods, it is plain
that if God is the author of evils, there must be another who does
things contrary to God, and gives to us good things. If there is such a
one, by what name must he be called? Why is he who injures us more known
to us than He who benefits us? But if this can be nothing besides God,
it is absurd and vain to suppose that the divine power, than which
nothing is greater or better, is able to injure, but unable to benefit;
and accordingly no one has ever existed who ventured to assert this,
because it is neither reasonable nor in any way credible. And because
this is agreed upon, let us pass on and seek after the truth elsewhere.
