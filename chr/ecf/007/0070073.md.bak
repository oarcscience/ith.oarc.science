#### <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXII.—Of the Precepts of Plato, and Censures of the Same.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p1"></span>It remains that the community of
which we have spoken admits of nothing else but adulteries and lusts,
for the utter extinction of which virtue is especially necessary.
Therefore he did not find the concord which he sought, because he did
not see whence it arises. For justice has no weight in outward
circumstances, not even in the body, <span
id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) but it is altogether employed on the
mind of man. He, therefore, who wishes to <span id="page_93">p.
93</span> <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-Page_93"></span>place men on an
equality, ought not to take away marriage and wealth, but arrogance,
pride, and haughtiness, that those who are powerful and lifted up on
high may know that they are on a level even with the most needy. For
insolence and injustice being taken from the rich, it will make no
difference whether some are rich and others poor, since they will be
equal in spirit, and nothing but reverence towards God can produce this
result. He thought, therefore, that he had found justice, whereas he had
altogether removed it, because it ought not to be a community of
perishable things, but of minds. For if justice is the mother <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md) of all virtues, when they are
severally taken away, it is also itself overthrown. But <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p3.2"></span>Plato took away above all things
frugality, which has no existence when there is no property of one’s own
which can be possessed; he took away abstinence, since there will be
nothing belonging to another from which one can abstain; he took away
temperance and chastity, which are the greatest virtues in each sex; he
took away self-respect, shame, and modesty, if those things which are
accustomed to be judged base and disgraceful begin to be accounted
honourable and lawful. Thus, while he wishes to confer virtue upon all,
he takes it away from all. For the ownership of property contains the
material both of vices and of virtues, but a community of goods contains
nothing else than the licentiousness of vices. For men who have many
mistresses can be called nothing else than luxurious and prodigal. And
likewise women who are in the possession of many men, must of necessity
be not adulteresses, because they have no fixed marriage, but
prostitutes and harlots. Therefore he reduced human life, I do not say
to the likeness of dumb animals, but of the herds and brutes. For almost
all the birds contract marriages, and are united in pairs, and defend
their nests, as though their marriage-beds, with harmonious mind, and
cherish their own young, because they are well known to them; and if you
put others in their way, they repel them. But this wise man, contrary to
the custom of men, and contrary to nature, chose more foolish objects of
imitation; and since he saw that the duties of males and females were
not separated in the case of other animals, he thought that women also
ought to engage in warfare, and take a share in the public counsels, and
undertake magistracies, and assume commands. And therefore he assigned
to them horses and arms: it follows that he should have assigned to men
wool and the loom, and the carrying of infants. Nor did he see the
impossibility of what he said, from the fact that no nation has existed
in the world so foolish or so vain as to live in this manner. <span

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p2"></span> The Stoics not only regarded
accidental things, but also our bodies themselves, as being without us.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p3"></span> Justice comprises within herself
all the virtues. And thus <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p3.1"></span>Aristotle calls her the mother of the
other virtues, because she cherishes as it were in her bosom all the
rest.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p4"></span> \[This caustic review of <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p4.1"></span>Plato is painfully just. Alas! that
such <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxii-p4.2"></span>opprobria should be
incapable of reply.\]
