#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. LXX.—The Immortality of the Soul is Confirmed.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p1"></span>It may in truth be collected from
many arguments that souls are eternal. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p1.1"></span>Plato says that that which always
moves by itself, and has no beginning of motion, also has no end; but
that the soul of man always moves by itself, and because it is flexible
for reflection, subtle for discovery, easy of perception, adapted to
learning, and because it retains the past, comprehends the present,
foresees the future, and embraces the knowledge of many subjects and
arts, that it is immortal, since it contains nothing which is mixed with
the contagion of earthly weight. Moreover, the eternity of the soul is
understood from virtue and pleasure. Pleasure is common to all animals,
virtue belongs only to man; the former is vicious, the latter is
honourable; the former is in accordance with nature, the latter is
opposed to nature, unless the soul is immortal. For in defence of faith
and justice, virtue neither fears want, nor is alarmed at exile, nor
dreads imprisonment, nor shrinks from pain, nor refuses death; and
because these things are contrary to nature, either virtue is
foolishness, if it stands in the way of advantages, and is injurious to
life; or if it is not foolishness, then the soul is immortal, and
despises present goods, because other things are preferable which it
attains after the dissolution of the body. But that is the greatest
proof of immortality, that man alone has the knowledge of God. In the
dumb animals there is no notion <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) of religion, because they are
earthly and bent down to the earth. Man is upright, and beholds the
heaven for this purpose, that he may seek God. Therefore he cannot be
other than immortal, who longs for the immortal. He cannot be liable to
dissolution, who is connected <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md)
with God both in countenance and mind. Finally, man alone makes use of
the heavenly element, which is fire. For if light is through fire, and
life through light, it is evident that he who has the use of fire is not
mortal, since this is closely connected, this is intimately related to
Him without whom neither light nor life can exist.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p4"></span>But why do we infer from arguments
that souls are eternal, when we have divine testimonies? For the sacred
writings and the voices of the prophets teach this. And if this appears
to any one insufficient, let him read the poems of the <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p4.1"></span>Sibyls, let him also weigh the answers
of the <span id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p4.2"></span>Milesian Apollo, that he
may understand that <span id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p4.3"></span>Democritus,
and <span id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p4.4"></span>Epicurus, and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lxvi-p4.5"></span>Dicæarchus raved, who alone of all
mortals denied that which is evident. Having proved the immortality of
the soul, it remains to teach by whom, and to whom, and in what manner,
and at what time, it is given. Since fixed and divinely appointed times
have begun to be filled up, a destruction and consummation of all things
must of necessity take place, that the world may be renewed by God. But
that time is at hand, as far as may be collected from the number of
years, and from the signs which are foretold by the prophets. But since
the things which have been spoken concerning the end of the world and
the conclusion of the times are innumerable, those very things which are
spoken are to be laid down without adornment, since it would be a
boundless task to bring forward the testimonies. If any one wishes for
them, or does not place full confidence in us, let him approach to the
very shrine of the heavenly letters, and being more fully instructed
through their trustworthiness, let him perceive that the philosophers
have erred, who thought either that this world was eternal, or that
there would be numberless thousands of years from the time when it was
prepared. For six thousand years have not yet been completed, and when
this number shall be made up, then at length all evil will be taken
away, that justice alone may reign. And how this will come to pass, I
will explain in few words.
