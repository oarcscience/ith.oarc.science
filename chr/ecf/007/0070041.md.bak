#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XI.—Of Living Creatures, of Man; Prometheus, Deucalion, the ParcÆ.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p1"></span>Therefore, having finished the world,
He commanded that animals of various kinds and of dissimilar forms
should be created, both great and smaller. And they were made in pairs,
that is, one of each sex; from the offspring of which both the air and
the earth and the seas were filled. And God gave nourishment to all
these by their kinds <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) from the
earth, that they might be of service to men: some, for instance, were
for food, others for clothing; but those which are of great strength He
gave, that they might assist in cultivating the earth, whence they were
called beasts of burthen. <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) And
thus, when all things had been settled with a wonderful arrangement, He
determined to prepare for Himself an eternal kingdom, and to create
innumerable souls, on whom He might bestow immortality. Then He made for
Himself a figure endowed with perception and intelligence, that is,
after the likeness of His own image, than which nothing can be more
perfect: He formed man out of the dust of the ground, from which he was
called man, <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) because He was made
from the earth. Finally, <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p4.4"></span>Plato says
that the human form <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) was godlike;
as does the <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p5.6"></span>Sibyl, who says,—  

> <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p5.7"></span> “Thou art my image, O man,
> possessed of right reason.” <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p7"></span>The poets also have not given a
different account respecting this formation of man, however they may
have corrupted it; for they said that man was made by <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p7.1"></span>Prometheus from clay. They were not
mistaken in the matter itself, but in the name of the artificer. For
they had never come into contact with a line of the truth; but the
things which were handed down by the oracles of the prophets, and
contained in the sacred book <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) of
God; those things collected from fables and obscure opinion, and
distorted, as the truth is wont to be corrupted by the multitude when
spread abroad by various conversations, everyone adding something to
that which he had heard,— those things they comprised in their poems;
and in this, indeed, <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p8.2"></span>they acted
foolishly, in that they attributed so wonderful and divine a work to
man. For what need was there that man should be formed of clay, when he
might be generated in the same way in which <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p8.3"></span>Prometheus himself was born from <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p8.4"></span>Iapetus? For if he was a man, he was able
to beget a man, but not to make one. But his punishment on Mount <span
id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-Page_59"></span>Caucasus declares that he was not of
the gods. But no one reckoned his father <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p8.5"></span>Iapetus or his uncle <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p9.1"></span>Titan as gods, because the high dignity of
the kingdom was in possession of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p9.2"></span>Saturn only, by which he obtained divine
honours, together with all his descendants. This invention of the poets
admits of refutation by many arguments. It is agreed by all that the
deluge took place for the destruction of wickedness, and for its removal
from the earth. Now, both philosophers and poets, and writers of ancient
history, assert the same, and in this they especially agree with the
language of the prophets. If, therefore, the flood took place for the
purpose of destroying wickedness, which had increased through the
excessive multitude of men, how was <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p9.3"></span>Prometheus the maker of man, when his son
<span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p9.4"></span>Deucalion is said by the same
writers to have been the only one who was preserved on account of his
righteousness? How could a single descent <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) and a single generation have so
quickly filled the world with men? But it is plain that they have
corrupted this also, as they did the former account; since they were
ignorant both at what time the flood happened on the earth, and who it
was that deserved on account of his righteousness to be saved when the
human race perished, and how and with whom he was saved: all of which
are taught by the inspired <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md)
writings. It is plain, therefore, that the account which they give
respecting the work of <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p11.1"></span>Prometheus
is false.  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p12"></span>But because I had said <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) that the poets are not accustomed to
speak that which is altogether untrue, but to wrap up in figures and
thus to obscure their accounts, I do not say that they spoke falsely in
this, but that first of all <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p13.3"></span>Prometheus made the image of a man of
rich and soft clay, and that he first originated the art of making
statues and images; inasmuch as he lived in the times of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p13.4"></span>Jupiter, during which temples began to be
built, and new modes of worshipping the gods introduced. And thus the
truth was corrupted by falsehood; and that which was said to have been
made by God began also to be ascribed to man, who imitated the divine
work. But the making of the true and living man from clay is the work of
God. And this also is related by Hermes, <span
id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) who not only says that man was made by
God, after the image of God, but he even tried to explain in how skilful
a manner He formed each limb in the human body, since there is none of
them which is not as available for the necessity of use as for beauty.
But even the Stoics, when they discuss the subject of providence,
attempt to do this; and <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p14.4"></span>Tully
followed them in many places. But, however, he briefly treats of a
subject so copious and fruitful, which I now pass over on this account,
because I have lately written a particular book on this subject to my
disciple <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p14.5"></span>Demetrianus. But I cannot
here omit that which some erring philosophers say, that men and the
other animals arose from the earth without any author; whence that
expression of Virgil: <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p15.3"></span> “And the earth-born <span
> id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) race of men raised its head from the
> hard fields.”  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p17"></span>And this opinion is especially
entertained by those who deny the existence of a <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p17.1"></span>divine providence. For the Stoics
attribute the formation of animals to divine skill. But <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p17.2"></span>Aristotle freed himself from labour and
trouble, by saying that the world always existed, and therefore that the
human race, and the other things which are in it, had no beginning, but
always had been, and always would be. But when we see that each animal
separately, which had no previous existence, begins to exist, and ceases
to exist, it is necessary that the whole race must at some time have
begun to exist, and must cease at some time because it had a beginning.
 

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p18"></span>For all things must necessarily be
comprised in three periods of time—the past, the present, and the
future. The commencement <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) belongs
to the past, existence to the present, dissolution to the future. And
all these things are seen in the case of men individually: for we begin
when we are born; and we exist while we live; and we cease when we die.
On which account they would have it that there are three Parcæ: <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) one who warps the web of life for men;
the second, who weaves it; the third, who cuts and finishes it. But in
the whole race of men, because the present time only is seen, yet from
it the past also, that is, the commencement, and the future, that is,
the dissolution, are inferred. For since it exists, it is evident that
at some time it began to exist, for nothing can exist without a
beginning; and because it had a beginning, it is evident that it will at
some time have an end. For that cannot, as a whole, be immortal, which
consists of mortals. For as we all die individually, it is possible
that, by some calamity, all may perish simultaneously: either through
the unproductiveness of the earth, which sometimes happens in particular
cases; or through the general spread of pestilence, which often
desolates separate cities and countries; or by the conflagration of the
world, as is said to have happened in the case of Phaethon; or by a
deluge, as is reported in the time of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p20.5"></span>Deucalion, when <span id="page_60">p.
60</span> <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-Page_60"></span>the whole race was
destroyed with the exception of one man. And if this deluge happened by
chance, it might assuredly have happened that he who was the only
survivor should perish. But if he was reserved by the will of divine
providence, as it cannot be denied, to recruit mankind, it is evident
that the life and the destruction of the human race are in the power of
God. And if it is possible for it to die altogether, because it dies in
parts, it is evident that it had an origin at some time; and as the
liability to decay <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) bespeaks a
beginning, so also it gives proof of an end. And if these things are
true, <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.1"></span>Aristotle will be unable to
maintain that the world also itself had no beginning. But if <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.2"></span>Plato and <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.3"></span>Epicurus extort this from <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.4"></span>Aristotle, yet <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.5"></span>Plato and <span
id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.6"></span>Aristotle, who thought that the world
would be everlasting, will, notwithstanding their eloquence, be deprived
of this also by <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.7"></span>Epicurus, because
it follows, that, <span id="iii.ii.ii.xi-p21.8"></span>as it had a
beginning, it must also have an end. But we will speak of these things
at greater length in the last book. Now let us revert to the origin of
man.
