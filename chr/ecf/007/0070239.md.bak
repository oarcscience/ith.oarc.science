#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xlvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. LI.—Of the Death of Christ on the Cross.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xlvii-p1"></span>I will now speak of the mystery
of the cross, lest any one should happen to say, If death must be
endured by Him, it should have been not one <span id="page_243">p.
243</span> <span id="iii.ii.viii.xlvii-Page_243"></span>that was
manifestly infamous and dishonourable, but one which had some honour. I
know, indeed, that many, while they dislike the name of the cross,
shrink from the truth, though there is in it great reasonableness and
power. For since He was sent for this purpose, that He might open to the
lowest men the way to salvation, He made Himself humble that He might
free them. Therefore He underwent that kind of death which is usually
inflicted on the humble, that an opportunity of imitation might be given
to all. Moreover, since He was about to rise again, it was not allowable
that His body should be in any way mutilated, or a bone broken, which
happens to those who are beheaded. Therefore the cross was preferred,
which reserved the body with the bones uninjured for the resurrection.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xlvii-p2"></span>To these grounds it was also
added, that having undertaken to suffer and to die, it was befitting
that He should be lifted up. Thus the cross exalted Him both in fact and
in emblem, <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) so that His
majesty and power became known to all, together with His passion. For in
that He extended His hands on the cross, He plainly stretched out His
wings towards the east and the west, under which all nations from either
side of the world might assemble and repose. But of what great weight
this sign is, and what power it has, is evident, since all the host of
demons is expelled and put to flight by this sign. And as He Himself
before His passion put to confusion demons by His word and command, so
now, by the name and sign of the same passion, unclean spirits, having
insinuated themselves into the bodies of men, are driven out, when
racked and tormented, and confessing themselves to be demons, they yield
themselves to God, who harasses them. What therefore can the Greeks
expect from their superstitions and with their wisdom, when they see
that their gods, whom they do not deny to be demons also, are subdued by
men through the cross?
