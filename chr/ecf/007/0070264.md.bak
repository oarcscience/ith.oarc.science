#### <span id="iii.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chap. I.—Of Divine and Human Wisdom.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>I have</span> often observed, <span
id="iii.iii.i-p1.2"></span>Donatus, that many persons hold this opinion,
which some philosophers also have maintained, that God is not subject to
anger; since the divine nature is either altogether beneficent, and that
it is inconsistent with His surpassing and excellent power to do injury
to any one; or, at any rate, He takes no notice of us at all, so that no
advantage comes to us from His goodness, and no evil from His ill-will.
But the error of these men, because it is very great, and tends to
overthrow the condition of human life, must be refuted by us, lest you
yourself also should be deceived, being incited by the authority of men
who deem themselves wise. Nor, however, are we so arrogant as to boast
that the truth is comprehended by our intellect; but we follow the
teaching of God, who alone is able to know and to reveal secret things.
But the philosophers, being destitute of this teaching, have imagined
that the nature of things can be ascertained by conjecture. But this is
impossible; because the mind of man, enclosed in the dark abode of the
body, is far removed from the perception of truth: and in this the
divine nature differs from the human, that ignorance is the property of
the human, knowledge of the divine nature.  

<span id="iii.iii.i-p2"></span>On which account we have need of some
light to dispel the darkness by which the reflection of man is
overspread, since, while we live in mortal flesh, we are unable to
divine by our senses. But the light of the human mind is God, and he who
has known and admitted Him into his breast will acknowledge the mystery
of the truth with an enlightened heart; but when God and heavenly
instruction are removed, all things are full of errors. And <span
id="iii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>Socrates, though he was the most learned of
all the philosophers, yet, that he might prove the ignorance of the
others, who thought that they possessed something, rightly said that he
knew nothing, except one thing—that he knew nothing. For he understood
that that learning had nothing certain, nothing true in itself; nor, as
some imagine, did he pretend <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md)
to learning that he might refute others, but he saw the truth in some
measure. And he testified even on his trial (as is related by <span
id="iii.iii.i-p3.3"></span>Plato) that there was no human wisdom. He so
despised, derided, and cast aside the learning in which the philosophers
then boasted, that he professed that very thing as the greatest
learning, that he had learnt that he knew nothing. If, therefore, there
is no human wisdom, as <span id="iii.iii.i-p3.4"></span>Socrates taught,
as <span id="iii.iii.i-p3.5"></span>Plato handed down, it is evident
that the knowledge of the truth is divine, and belongs to no other than
to God. Therefore God must be known, in whom alone is the truth. He is
the Parent of the world, and the Framer of all things; who is not seen
with the eyes, and is scarcely distinguished by the mind; whose religion
is accustomed to be attacked in many ways by those who have neither been
able to attain true wisdom, nor to comprehend the system of the great
and heavenly secret.
