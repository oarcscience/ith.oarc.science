#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xliv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLVIII.—Of the Disinheriting of the Jews, and the Adoption of the Gentiles.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xliv-p1"></span>Since, therefore, He sits at the
right hand of God, about to tread down His enemies, who tortured Him,
when He shall come to judge the world, it is evident that no hope
remains to the Jews, unless, turning themselves to repentance, and being
cleansed from the blood with which they polluted themselves, they shall
begin to hope in Him whom they denied. <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) Therefore <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xliv-p2.3"></span>Esdras thus speaks: <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) “This passover is our Saviour and
our refuge. Consider and let it come into your heart, that we have to
abase <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xliv-Page_242"></span>Him in a figure: and after these
things we have hoped <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) in Him.”
 

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xliv-p5"></span>Now that the Jews were
disinherited, because they rejected Christ, and that we, who are of the
Gentiles, were adopted into their place, is proved by the Scriptures.
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xliv-p5.1"></span>Jeremiah <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) thus speaks: “I have forsaken mine
house, I have given mine heritage into the hands of her enemies. Mine
heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it hath given forth
its voice against me: therefore have I hated it.” Also <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xliv-p6.2"></span>Malachi: <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) “I have no pleasure in you, saith
the Lord, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the
rising of the sun even unto the going down thereof, my name shall be
great among the Gentiles.” <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xliv-p7.2"></span>Isaiah also thus speaks: <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) “I come to gather all nations and
tongues: and they shall come and see my glory.” The same says in another
place, <span id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) speaking in the person
of the Father to the Son: “I the Lord have called Thee in righteousness,
and will hold Thine hand, and will keep Thee, and give Thee for a
covenant of my people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the eyes of
the blind, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit
in darkness out of the prison-house.”
