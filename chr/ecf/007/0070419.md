#### <span id="viii.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI. <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469) —Concerning Teachers, Apostles, and Prophets.

<span id="viii.iii.xi-p2"></span>1. Whosoever, therefore, cometh and
teacheth you all these things that have been said before, receive
him. <span id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470) 2. But if the teacher
himself turn <span id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471) and teach
another doctrine to the destruction of this, hear him not; but <span
id="viii.iii.xi-p4.1"></span>if he teach so as to increase righteousness
and the knowledge of the Lord, receive him as the Lord. 3. But
concerning the apostles and prophets, according to the decree of the
Gospel, thus do. 4. Let every apostle that cometh to you be received as
the Lord. <span id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472) 5. But he shall not
remain <span id="viii.iii.xi-p5.9"></span>except one day; but if there
be need, also the next; but if he remain three days, he is a false
prophet. 6. And when the apostle goeth away, let him take nothing but
bread until he lodgeth; <span id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473) but
if he ask money, he is a false prophet. 7. And every prophet that
speaketh in the Spirit <span id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474) ye
shall neither try nor judge; for every sin shall be forgiven, but this
sin shall not be forgiven. <span id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475) 8.
But not every one that speaketh in the Spirit is a prophet; but only if
he hold the ways of the Lord. Therefore from their ways shall the false
prophet and the prophet be known. 9. And every prophet who ordereth a
meal <span id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476) in the Spirit eateth not
from it, except indeed he be a false prophet; 10. and every prophet who
teacheth the truth, if he do not what he teacheth, is a false prophet.
11. And every prophet, proved true, <span
id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477) working unto the mystery of the
Church in the world, <span id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478) yet not
teaching <span id="viii.iii.xi-p11.6"></span>others to <span
id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span id="viii.iii.xi-Page_381"></span> do
what he himself doeth, shall not be judged among you, for with God he
hath his judgment; for so did also the ancient prophets. But whoever
saith in the Spirit, Give me money, or something else, ye shall not
listen to him; but if he saith to you to give for others’ sake who are
in need, let no one judge him.

<span id="viii.iii.xi-p1"></span> The <span
id="viii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions (vii. 27) present
scarcely any parallel to this chapter, which points to an earlier
period, when ecclesiastical polity was less developed, and the
travelling “Apostles” and “Prophets” here spoken of were numerous.

40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040)<span id="viii.iii.xi-p5.1"></span>.
The mention of apostles here has caused much discussion, but there are
many indications that travelling evangelists were thus termed for some
time after the apostolic age. Bishop <span
id="viii.iii.xi-p5.2"></span>Lightfoot has shown, that, even in the New
Testament, a looser use of the term applied it to others than the
Twelve. Comp. [Rom. xvi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007)<span

date.

<span id="viii.iii.xi-p8"></span> Probably a reference to the sin
against the Holy Spirit. [Matt. 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031),

<span id="viii.iii.xi-p9"></span> Probably a love-feast, commanded by
the prophet in his peculiar utterance.  

<span id="fn_2477"></span>[380:2478](0070419.htm#fr_2477) <span

<span id="viii.iii.xi-p10"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="fn_2478"></span>[380:2479](0070419.htm#fr_2478) <span
id="viii.iii.xi-p10.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xi-p11"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xi-p11.1"></span>ποιῶν εἰς μυστήριον κοσμικὸν
ἐκκλησίας,</span> “working unto a worldly mystery of (the) Church,” or
“making assemblies for a worldly mystery.” Either rendering is
grammatical: neither is very intelligible. The paraphrase in the above
version presents one leading view of this difficult passage: the mystery
is the Church, and a worldly one, because the Church is in the world.
The other leading view joins <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xi-p11.2"></span>ἐκκλησίας</span> (as accusative) with
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.xi-p11.3"></span>ποιῶν</span>,
“making assemblies for a worldly mystery.” So <span
id="viii.iii.xi-p11.4"></span>Bryennios, who regards the worldly mystery
as a symbolical act of the prophet. Others suggest, as the mystery for
which the assemblies are called, revelation of future events, celibacy,
the Eucharist, the ceremonial law. It seems, at all events, to point to
incipient fanaticism on the part of the prophets of those days.
\[Elucidation III.\] This was likely to take the form either of
asceticism or of extravagant predictions and mystical fancies about the
Church in the world. Did we know the place and the time more accurately,
we might decide which was meant. This caution was evidently needed: Let
God judge such extravagances.
