<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1"></A>Let us pass on to former things, that we may discover the origin of the whole error. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.1"></A>Saturnus is said to have been born of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.2"></A>C&#339;lus and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.3"></A>Terra. This is plainly incredible; but there is a certain reason why it is thus related, and he who is ignorant of this rejects it as a fable. That <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.4"></A>Uranus was the father of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.5"></A>Saturnus, both <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.6"></A>Hermes affirms, and sacred history teaches. When <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.7"></A>Trismegistus said that there were very few men of perfect learning, he enumerated among them his relatives, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.8"></A>Uranus, <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.9"></A>Saturnus, and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.10"></A>Mercurius. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.11"></A>Euhemerus relates that the same <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.12"></A>Uranus was the first who reigned on earth, using these words: &#8220;In the beginning <a name="iii.ii.viii.xv-p1.13"></A>C&#339;lus first had the chief power on earth: he instituted and prepared that kingdom for himself together with his brothers.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1466"></A><A HREF="#fn_1466"><FONT SIZE="1">1467</FONT></A>
