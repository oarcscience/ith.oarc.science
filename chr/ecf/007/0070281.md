#### <span id="iii.iii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVIII.—Of the Punishment of Faults, that It Cannot Take Place Without Anger.

<span id="iii.iii.xviii-p1"></span>What need is there, they say, of
anger, since faults can be corrected without this affection? But there
is no one who can calmly see any one committing an offence. This may
perhaps be <span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="iii.iii.xviii-Page_275"></span>possible in him who presides over the
laws, because the deed is not committed before his eyes, but it is
brought before him as a doubtful matter from another quarter. Nor can
any wickedness be so manifest, that there is no place for a defence; and
therefore it is possible that a judge may not be moved against him who
may possibly be found to be innocent; and when the detected crime shall
have come to light, he now no longer uses his own opinion, but that of
the laws. It may be granted that he does that which he does without
anger; for he has that which he may follow. We, undoubtedly, when an
offence is committed by our household at home, whether we see or
perceive it, must be indignant; for the very sight of a sin is
unbecoming. For he who is altogether unmoved either approves of faults,
which is more disgraceful and unjust, or avoids the trouble of reproving
them, which a tranquil spirit and a quiet mind despises and refuses,
unless anger shall have aroused and incited it. But when any one is
moved, and yet through unseasonable leniency grants pardon more
frequently than is necessary, or at all times, he evidently both
destroys the life of those whose audacity he is fostering for greater
crimes, and furnishes himself with a perpetual source of annoyances.
Therefore the restraining of one’s anger in the case of sins is faulty.
 

<span id="iii.iii.xviii-p2"></span><span
id="iii.iii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Archytas of Tarentum is praised, who,
when he had found everything ruined <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758.md) on his estate, rebuking the fault
of his bailiff, said, “Wretch, I would have beaten you to death if I had
not been angry.” They consider this to be a singular example of
forbearance; but influenced by authority, they do not see how foolishly
he spoke and acted. For if (as <span
id="iii.iii.xviii-p3.2"></span>Plato says) no prudent man punishes
because there is an offence, but to prevent the occurrence of an
offence, it is evident how evil an example this wise man put forth. For
if slaves shall perceive that their master uses violence when he is not
angry, and abstains from violence <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759.md) when he is angry, it is evident
that they will not commit slight offences, lest they should be beaten;
but will commit the greatest offences, that they may arouse the anger of
the perverse man, and escape with impunity. But I should praise him if,
when he was enraged, he had given space to his anger, that the
excitement of his mind might calm down through the interval of time, and
his chastisement might be confined within moderate limits. Therefore, on
account of the magnitude of the anger, punishment ought not to have been
inflicted, but to have been delayed, lest it should inflict <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760.md) upon the offender pain greater than
is just, or occasion an outburst of fury in the punisher. But how, how
is it equitable or wise, that any one should be punished on account of a
slight offence, and should be unpunished on account of a very great one?
But if he had learned the nature and causes of things, he never would
have professed so unsuitable a forbearance, that a wicked slave should
rejoice that his master has been angry with him. For as God has
furnished the human body with many and various senses which are
necessary for the use of life, so also He has assigned to the soul
various affections by which the course of life might be regulated; and
as He has given desire for the sake of producing offspring, so has He
given anger for the sake of restraining faults.  

<span id="iii.iii.xviii-p6"></span>But they who are ignorant of the ends
of good and evil things, as they employ sensual desire for the purposes
of corruption and pleasure, in the same manner make use of anger and
passion for the inflicting of injury, while they are angry with those
whom they regard with hatred. Therefore they are angry even with those
who commit no offence, even with their equals, or even with their
superiors. Hence they daily rush to monstrous <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761.md) deeds; hence tragedies often arise.
Therefore Archytas would be deserving of praise, if, when he had been
enraged against any citizen or equal who injured him, he had curbed
himself, and by forbearance mitigated the impetuosity of his fury. This
self-restraint is glorious, by which any great evil which impends is
restrained; but it is a fault not to check the faults of slaves and
children; for through their escaping without punishment they will
proceed to greater evil. In this case anger is not to be restrained; but
even if it is in a state of inactivity, <span
id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762.md) it must be aroused. But that which
we say respecting man, we also say respecting God, who made man like to
Himself. I omit making mention of the figure of God, because the Stoics
say that God has no form, and another great subject will arise if we
should wish to refute them. I only speak respecting the soul. If it
belongs <span id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763.md) to God to reflect, to
be wise, to understand, to foresee. to excel, and of all animals man
alone has these qualities, it follows that he was made after the
likeness of God; but on this account he goes on to vice, because, being
mingled with frailty derived from earth, he is unable to preserve pure
and uncontaminated that which he has received from God, unless he is
imbued with the precepts of justice by the same God.
