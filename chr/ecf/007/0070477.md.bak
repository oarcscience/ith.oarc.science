### <span id="xi-p1.1"></span>Nicene Council

## <span id="xi-p1.2"></span>The Nicene Creed.

##### <span id="xi-p1.3"></span>The Creed

<span id="xi-p2"></span><span id="xi-p2.1"></span>As set forth at
Nicœa, <span id="fr_4013"></span>[4014](#fn_4013.md) <span
id="xi-p3.5"></span>a.d.<span id="xi-p3.6"></span> 325.  

<span id="xi-p4"></span><span id="xi-p4.1"></span>We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty, Maker of all things, visible and invisible:  

<span id="xi-p5"></span>And in one Lord <span id="xi-p5.1"></span>Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father, only begotten, that is,
of the substance of the Father;  

<span id="xi-p6"></span>God of God; Light of light; very God of very
God; begotten, not made; being of one substance with the Father,  

<span id="xi-p7"></span>By whom all things were made, both things in
heaven and things in earth:  

<span id="xi-p8"></span>Who for us men and for our salvation came down,
and was incarnate, and was made man:  

<span id="xi-p9"></span>He suffered, and rose again the third day:  

<span id="xi-p10"></span>And ascended into heaven:  

<span id="xi-p11"></span>And shall come again to judge the quick and the
dead.  

<span id="xi-p12"></span>And in the Holy Ghost, etc. <span
id="fr_4014"></span>[4015](#fn_4014.md)  

##### <span id="xi-p13.4"></span>The Ratification.

<span id="xi-p14"></span><span id="xi-p14.1"></span>And those who say
<span id="xi-p14.2"></span>There was a time when He was not<span
id="xi-p14.3"></span>, or that <span id="xi-p14.4"></span>Before He was
begotten He was not<span id="xi-p14.5"></span>, or that <span
id="xi-p14.6"></span>He was made out of nothing;<span
id="xi-p14.7"></span> or who say that The <span id="xi-p14.8"></span>Son
of God is of any other substance<span id="xi-p14.9"></span>, or that
<span id="xi-p14.10"></span>He is changeable<span id="xi-p14.11"></span>
or <span id="xi-p14.12"></span>unstable<span
id="xi-p14.13"></span>,—these the Catholic and Apostolic Church
anathematizes.  

##### <span id="xi-p14.14"></span>Addenda,

<span id="xi-p15"></span><span id="xi-p15.1"></span>As Authorized at
<span id="xi-p15.2"></span>Constantinople<span id="xi-p15.3"></span>,
<span id="xi-p15.4"></span>a.d.<span id="xi-p15.5"></span> 381.  

<span id="xi-p16"></span>(<span id="xi-p16.1"></span>a) Of heaven and
earth.  

<span id="xi-p17"></span>(<span id="xi-p17.1"></span>b) Begotten of the
Father before all worlds.  

<span id="xi-p18"></span>(<span id="xi-p18.1"></span>c) By the Holy
Ghost of the Virgin Mary.  

<span id="xi-p19"></span>(<span id="xi-p19.1"></span>d) Was crucified
also for us, under <span id="xi-p19.2"></span>Pontius Pilate,  

<span id="xi-p20"></span>(<span id="xi-p20.1"></span>e) And was buried.
 

<span id="xi-p21"></span>(<span id="xi-p21.1"></span>f) Sitteth on the
right hand of the Father,  

<span id="xi-p22"></span>(<span id="xi-p22.1"></span>g) Whose kingdom
shall have no end.  

<span id="xi-p23"></span>(<span id="xi-p23.1"></span>h) The Lord, the
Giver of life,  

<span id="xi-p24"></span>Who proceedeth from the Father; <span
id="fr_4015"></span>[4016](#fn_4015.md)  

<span id="xi-p26"></span>Who with the Father and the Son together is
worshipped and glorified; <span id="page_525">p. 525</span> <span
id="xi-Page_525"></span>  

<span id="xi-p27"></span>Who spake by the prophets:  

<span id="xi-p28"></span>In one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  

<span id="xi-p29"></span>We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of
sins.  

<span id="xi-p30"></span>We look for the resurrection of the dead,  

<span id="xi-p31"></span>And the life of the world to come. Amen.  

<span id="xi-p32"></span>  

<span id="xi-p33"></span>This Nicæno-Constantinopolitan Creed was
solemnly ratified by the Council of Ephesus (<span
id="xi-p33.1"></span>a.d. 431) with the decree <span
id="fr_4016"></span>[4017](#fn_4016.md) that “No one <span
id="fr_4017"></span>[4018](#fn_4017.md) shall be permitted to introduce,
write, or compose <span id="xi-p35.4"></span>any other faith, <span
id="fr_4018"></span>[4019](#fn_4018.md) besides that which was defined by
the holy Fathers assembled in the city of Nice, with <span
id="xi-p36.5"></span>the presence of the Holy Ghost.”

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4013"></span>[524:4014](0070477.htm#fr_4013.md) <span
id="xi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="xi-p3"></span> It was the old Creed of Jerusalem slightly
amended, and made the liturgic symbol of Christendom, and the exponent
of Catholic orthodoxy. Compare the Creed of Cæsarea, <span
id="xi-p3.1"></span>Burbidge, p. 334. But see this whole subject
admirably illustrated for popular study by <span
id="xi-p3.2"></span>Burbidge, <span id="xi-p3.3"></span>Liturgies and
Offices of the Church<span id="xi-p3.4"></span>, p. 330, etc., London,
Bells, 1885.  

<span id="fn_4014"></span>[524:4015](0070477.htm#fr_4014.md) <span
id="xi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xi-p13"></span> Here the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi-p13.1"></span>κ.τ.λͅ.</span> is to be understood, as in the
liturgies where a known form is begun and left imperfect. The clauses
(see <span id="xi-p13.2"></span>Cyril of Jerusalem, <span
id="xi-p13.3"></span>Catechet., lect. xviii.) are found in the Creed of
Jerusalem, thus: “In one baptism of repentance for the remission of
sins, and in one Holy Catholic Church; and in the resurrection of the
flesh; and in eternal life.”  

<span id="fn_4015"></span>[524:4016](0070477.htm#fr_4015.md) <span
id="xi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xi-p25"></span> The addition of the <span
id="xi-p25.1"></span>Filioque, in the West, is theologically true, but
of no authority here. See <span id="xi-p25.2"></span>Pearson, <span
id="xi-p25.3"></span>On the Creed.  

<span id="fn_4016"></span>[525:4017](0070477.htm#fr_4016.md) <span
id="xi-p33.2"></span>

<span id="xi-p34"></span> Canon vii.  

<span id="fn_4017"></span>[525:4018](0070477.htm#fr_4017.md) <span
id="xi-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xi-p35"></span> <span id="xi-p35.1"></span>No one. This
re-affirms the action of Nicæa itself, and forbids the imposition of
anything novel as a creed by any authority whatever. Nothing, therefore,
which has not been set forth by Nicene authority (or by the
supplementing and co-equal councils of the whole Church, from the same
primitive sources) can be a creed, strictly speaking. It may be an
orthodox confession, like the <span class="Foreign"><span
id="xi-p35.2"></span>Quicunque Vult</span>, but cannot be imposed in
terms of communion, any more than the <span class="Foreign"><span
id="xi-p35.3"></span>Te Deum</span>  

<span id="fn_4018"></span>[525:4019](0070477.htm#fr_4018.md) <span
id="xi-p35.5"></span>

<span id="xi-p36"></span> <span id="xi-p36.1"></span>Any other faith.
The composition and setting north of <span id="xi-p36.2"></span>another
faith, as terms of communion, by Pius IV., bishop of Rome, <span
class="sc"><span id="xi-p36.3"></span>a.d.</span> 1564, and its
acceptance, with additional dogmas, at the opening of the Vatican
Council (so-called), <span class="sc"><span
id="xi-p36.4"></span>a.d.</span> 1869, brought the whole Papal communion
under this anathema of Ephesus.
