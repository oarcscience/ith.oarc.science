<span id="ix.vii.i"></span>

#### <span id="ix.vii.i-p0.1"></span>Sec. I.—On Heresies.

##### <span id="ix.vii.i-p0.2"></span>Who They Were that Ventured to Make Schisms, and Did Not Escape Punishment.

<span id="ix.vii.i-p1"></span>I. <span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.i-p1.1"></span>Above</span> all things, O bishop, avoid the
sad and dangerous and most atheistical heresies, eschewing them as fire
that burns those that come near to it. Avoid also schisms: for it is
neither lawful to turn one’s mind towards wicked heresies, nor to
separate from those of the same sentiment out of ambition. For some who
ventured to set up such practices of old did not escape punishment. For
<span id="ix.vii.i-p1.2"></span>Dathan and <span
id="ix.vii.i-p1.3"></span>Abiram, <span
id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156.md) who set up in opposition to <span
id="ix.vii.i-p2.2"></span>Moses, were swallowed up into the earth. But
<span id="ix.vii.i-p2.3"></span>Corah, and those two hundred and fifty
who with him raised a sedition against <span
id="ix.vii.i-p2.4"></span>Aaron, were consumed by fire. <span
id="ix.vii.i-p2.5"></span>Miriam also, who reproached <span
id="ix.vii.i-p2.6"></span>Moses, was cast out of the camp for seven
days; for she said that <span id="ix.vii.i-p2.7"></span>Moses had taken
an Ethiopian to wife. <span id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157.md) Nay, in
the case of <span id="ix.vii.i-p3.2"></span>Azariah and <span
id="ix.vii.i-p3.3"></span>Uzziah, <span
id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md) the latter of which was king of
Judah, but venturing to usurp the priesthood, and desiring to offer
incense, which it was not lawful for him to do, was hindered by <span
id="ix.vii.i-p4.2"></span>Azariah the high priest, and the fourscore
priests; and when he would not obey he found the leprosy to arise in his
forehead, and he hastened to go out, because the Lord had reproved him.
 

##### <span id="ix.vii.i-p4.3"></span>That It is Not Lawful to Rise Up Either Against the Kingly or the Priestly Office.

<span id="ix.vii.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.i-p5.1"></span>II</span>. Let us therefore, beloved, consider
what sort of glory that of the seditious is, and what their
condemnation. For if he that rises up against kings is worthy of
punishment, even though he be a son or a friend, how much more he that
rises up against the priests! For by how much the priesthood is more
noble than the royal power, as having its concern about the soul, so
much has he a greater punishment who ventures to oppose the priesthood,
than he who ventures to oppose the royal power, although neither of them
goes unpunished. For neither did <span id="ix.vii.i-p5.2"></span>Absalom
nor <span id="ix.vii.i-p5.3"></span>Abdadan <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md) escape without punishment; nor
<span id="ix.vii.i-p6.2"></span>Corah and <span
id="ix.vii.i-p6.3"></span>Dathan. <span
id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md) The former rose against <span
id="ix.vii.i-p7.2"></span>David, and strove concerning the kingdom; the
latter against <span id="ix.vii.i-p7.3"></span>Moses, concerning
pre-eminence. And they both spake evil; <span
id="ix.vii.i-p7.4"></span>Absalom of his father <span
id="ix.vii.i-p7.5"></span>David, as of an unjust judge, saying to every
one: “Thy words are good, but there is no one that will hear thee, and
do thee justice. Who will make me a ruler?” <span
id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md) But <span
id="ix.vii.i-p8.2"></span>Abdadan: “I have no part in <span
id="ix.vii.i-p8.3"></span>David, nor any inheritance in the son of
Jesse.” <span id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md) It is plain that he
could not endure to be under <span id="ix.vii.i-p9.2"></span>David’s
government, of whom God spake: “I have found <span
id="ix.vii.i-p9.3"></span>David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart,
who will do all my commands.” <span id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md)
But <span id="ix.vii.i-p10.2"></span>Dathan and <span
id="ix.vii.i-p10.3"></span>Abiram, and the followers of <span
id="ix.vii.i-p10.4"></span>Corah, said to <span
id="ix.vii.i-p10.5"></span>Moses: “Is it a small thing that thou hast
brought us out of the land of Egypt, out of a land flowing with milk and
honey? And why hast thou put out our eyes? And wilt thou rule over us?”
And they gathered together against him a great congregation; and the
followers of <span id="ix.vii.i-p10.6"></span>Corah said: “Has God
spoken alone to <span id="ix.vii.i-p10.7"></span>Moses? Why is it that
He has given the high-priesthood to <span
id="ix.vii.i-p10.8"></span>Aaron alone? Is not all the congregation of
the Lord holy? And why is <span id="ix.vii.i-p10.9"></span>Aaron alone
possessed of the priesthood?” <span id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md)
And before this, one said: “Who made thee a ruler and a judge over
us?” <span id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md)  

##### <span id="ix.vii.i-p12.2"></span>Concerning the Virtue of Moses and the Incredulity of the Jewish Nation, and What Wonderful Works God Did Among Them.

<span id="ix.vii.i-p13"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.i-p13.1"></span>III</span>. And they raised a sedition
against <span id="ix.vii.i-p13.2"></span>Moses the servant of God, the
meekest of all men, <span id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) and
faithful, and affronted <span id="fr_3167"></span>[3168](#fn_3167.md) so
great a man with the highest ingratitude; him who was their lawgiver,
and guardian, and high priest, and king, the administrator <span
id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span id="ix.vii.i-Page_451"></span>of
divine things; one that showed as a creator the mighty works of the
Creator; the meekest man, freest from arrogance, and full of fortitude,
and most benign in his temper; one who had delivered them from many
dangers, and freed them from several deaths by his holiness; who had
done so many signs and wonders from God before the people, and had
performed glorious and wonderful works for their benefit; who had <span
id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168.md) brought the ten plagues upon the
Egyptians; who had divided the Red Sea, and had separated the waters as
a wall on this side and on that side, and had led the people through
them as through a dry wilderness, <span
id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169.md) and had drowned Pharaoh and the
Egyptians, and all that were in company with them; <span
id="fr_3170"></span>[3171](#fn_3170.md) and had made the fountain sweet for
them with wood, and had brought water out of the stony rock for them
when they were thirsty; <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171.md) and
had given them manna out of heaven, and had distributed flesh to them
out of the air; <span id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172.md) and had
afforded them a pillar of fire in the night to enlighten and conduct
them, and a pillar of a cloud to shadow them in the day, by reason of
the violent heat of the sun; <span id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173.md)
and had exhibited to them the law of God, engraven from the mouth, and
hand, and writing of God, in tables of stone, the perfect number of ten
commandments; <span id="fr_3174"></span>[3175](#fn_3174.md) “to whom God
spake face to face, as if a man spake to his friend;” <span
id="fr_3175"></span>[3176](#fn_3175.md) of whom He said, “And there arose
not a prophet like unto <span id="ix.vii.i-p23.2"></span>Moses.” <span
id="fr_3176"></span>[3177](#fn_3176.md) Against him arose the followers of
<span id="ix.vii.i-p24.2"></span>Corah, and the Reubenites, <span
id="fr_3177"></span>[3178](#fn_3177.md) and threw stones at <span
id="ix.vii.i-p25.2"></span>Moses, who prayed, and said: “Accept not Thou
their offering.” <span id="fr_3178"></span>[3179](#fn_3178.md) And the
glory of God appeared, and sent some down into the earth, and burnt up
others with fire; and so, as to those ringleaders of this schismatical
deceit which said, “Let us make ourselves a leader,” <span
id="fr_3179"></span>[3180](#fn_3179.md) the earth opened its mouth, and
swallowed them up, and their tents, and what appertained to them, and
they went down alive into hell; but he destroyed the followers of <span
id="ix.vii.i-p27.2"></span>Corah with fire.
