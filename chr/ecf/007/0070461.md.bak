<span id="ix.viii.ii"></span>

#### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>Sec. II.—On the Formation of the Character of Believers, and on Giving of Thanks to God.

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p0.2"></span>That We Ought Not to Despise Any of the Sorts of Food that are Set Before Us, But Gratefully and Orderly to Partake of Them.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>XX</span>. Now concerning the several sorts
of food, the Lord says to thee, “Ye shall eat the good things of the
earth;” <span id="fr_3436"></span>[3437](#fn_3436.md) and, “All sorts of
flesh shall ye eat, as the green herb;” <span
id="fr_3437"></span>[3438](#fn_3437.md) but, “Thou shalt pour out the
blood.” <span id="fr_3438"></span>[3439](#fn_3438.md) For “not those things
that go into the mouth, but those that come out of it, defile a
man;” <span id="fr_3439"></span>[3440](#fn_3439.md) I mean blasphemies,
evil-speaking, and if there be any other thing of the like nature. <span
id="fr_3440"></span>[3441](#fn_3440.md) But “do thou eat the fat of the
land with righteousness.” <span id="fr_3441"></span>[3442](#fn_3441.md) For
“if there be anything pleasant, it is His; and if there be anything
good, it is His. Wheat for the young men, and wine to cheer the maids.”
For “who shall eat or who shall drink without Him?” <span
id="fr_3442"></span>[3443](#fn_3442.md) Wise <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p8.2"></span>Ezra <span
id="fr_3443"></span>[3444](#fn_3443.md) does also admonish thee and say:
“Go your way, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and be not
sorrowful.” <span id="fr_3444"></span>[3445](#fn_3444.md)  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p10.2"></span>That We Ought to Avoid the Eating of Things Offered to Idols.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p11.1"></span>XXI</span>. But do ye abstain from things
offered to idols; <span id="fr_3445"></span>[3446](#fn_3445.md) for they
offer them in honour of demons, that is, to the dishonour of the one
God, that ye may not become partners with demons.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p12.2"></span>A Constitution of Our Lord, How We Ought to Baptize, and into Whose Death.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p13"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p13.1"></span>XXII</span>. Now concerning baptism, <span
id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446.md) O bishop, or presbyter, we have
already given direction, and we now say, that thou shalt so baptize as
the Lord commanded us, saying: “Go ye, and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
(teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you):” <span id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447.md) of the Father who
sent, of Christ who came, of the Comforter who testified. But thou shalt
beforehand anoint the person with the holy oil, and afterward baptize
him with the water, and in the conclusion shall seal him with the
ointment; that the anointing with oil may be the participation of the
Holy Spirit, and the water the symbol of the death <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p15.2"></span>of Christ, and the ointment the seal of the
covenants. But if there be neither oil nor ointment, water is sufficient
both for the anointing, and for the seal, and for the confession of Him
that is dead, or indeed is dying together <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p15.3"></span>with Christ. But before baptism, let him
that is to be baptized fast; for even the Lord, when He was first
baptized by <span id="ix.viii.ii-p15.4"></span>John, and abode in the
wilderness, did afterward fast forty days and forty nights. <span
id="fr_3448"></span>[3449](#fn_3448.md) But He was baptized, and then
fasted, not having Himself any need of cleansing, or of fasting, or of
purgation, who was by nature pure and holy; but that He might testify
the truth to <span id="ix.viii.ii-p16.2"></span>John, and afford an
example to us. Wherefore our Lord was not baptized into His own passion,
or death, or resurrection—for none of those things had then happened—but
for another purpose. Wherefore He by His own authority fasted after His
baptism, as being the Lord of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p16.3"></span>John.
But he who is to be initiated into His death ought first to fast, and
then to be baptized. For it is not reasonable that he who has been
buried <span id="ix.viii.ii-p16.4"></span>with Christ, and is risen
again with Him, should appear dejected at His very resurrection. For man
is not lord of our Saviour’s constitution, since one is the Master and
the other the servant.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p16.5"></span>Which Days of the Week We are to Fast, and Which Not, and for What Reasons.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p17"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p17.1"></span>XXIII</span>. But let not your fasts be
with the hypocrites; <span id="fr_3449"></span>[3450](#fn_3449.md) for they
fast on the second and fifth days of the week. But do you either fast
the entire five days, or on the fourth day of the week, and on the day
of the Preparation, because on the fourth day the condemnation went out
against the Lord, <span id="ix.viii.ii-p18.2"></span>Judas then
promising to betray Him for money; and you must fast on the day of the
Preparation, because on that day the Lord suffered the death of the
cross under <span id="ix.viii.ii-p18.3"></span>Pontius Pilate. But keep
the Sabbath, and the Lord’s day festival; because the former is the
memorial of the creation, and the latter of the resurrection. But there
is one only Sabbath to be observed by you in the whole year, which is
that of our Lord’s burial, on which men ought to keep a fast, but not a
festival. For inasmuch as the Creator was then under the earth, the
sorrow for Him is more forcible than the joy for the creation; for the
Creator is more honourable by nature and dignity than His own creatures.
<span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span id="ix.viii.ii-Page_470"></span>
 

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p18.4"></span>What Sort of People Ought to Pray that Prayer that Was Given by the Lord.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p19"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p19.1"></span>XXIV</span>. Now, “when ye pray, be not ye
as the hypocrites;” <span id="fr_3450"></span>[3451](#fn_3450.md) but as
the Lord has appointed us in the Gospel, so pray ye: “Our Father which
art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done,
as in heaven, so on earth; give us this day our daily bread; and forgive
us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil; for Thine is the kingdom for ever.
Amen.” <span id="fr_3451"></span>[3452](#fn_3451.md) Pray thus thrice in a
day, preparing yourselves beforehand, that ye may be worthy of the
adoption of the Father; lest, when you call Him Father unworthily, you
be reproached by Him, as Israel once His first-born son was told: “If I
be a Father, where is my glory? And if I be a Lord, where is my
fear?” <span id="fr_3452"></span>[3453](#fn_3452.md) For the glory of
fathers is the holiness of their children, and the honour of masters is
the fear of their servants, as the contrary is dishonour and confusion.
For says He: “Through you my name is blasphemed among the
Gentiles.” <span id="fr_3453"></span>[3454](#fn_3453.md)  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p23.2"></span>A Mystical Thanksgiving.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p24"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p24.1"></span>XXXV</span>. Be ye always thankful, as
faithful and honest servants; and concerning the eucharistical
thanksgiving say thus: <span id="fr_3454"></span>[3455](#fn_3454.md) We
thank Thee, our Father, for that life which Thou hast made known to us
by <span id="ix.viii.ii-p25.2"></span>Jesus Thy Son, by whom Thou madest
all things, and takest care of the whole world; whom Thou hast sent to
become man for our salvation; whom Thou hast permitted to suffer and to
die; whom Thou hast raised up, and been pleased to glorify, and hast set
Him down on Thy right hand; by whom Thou hast promised us the
resurrection of the dead. Do thou, O Lord Almighty, everlasting God, so
gather together Thy Church from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom,
as this <span id="ix.viii.ii-p25.3"></span>corn was once scattered, and
is now become one loaf. We also, our Father, thank Thee for the precious
blood of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p25.4"></span>Jesus Christ, which was shed
for us and for His precious body, whereof we celebrate this
representation, as Himself appointed us, “to show forth His
death.” <span id="fr_3455"></span>[3456](#fn_3455.md) For through Him glory
is to be given to Thee for ever. Amen. Let no one eat of these things
that is not initiated; but those only who have been baptized into the
death of the Lord. But if any one that is not initiated conceal himself,
and partake of the same, “he eats eternal damnation;” <span
id="fr_3456"></span>[3457](#fn_3456.md) because, being not of the faith of
Christ, he has partaken of such things as it is not lawful for him to
partake of, to his own punishment. But if any one is a partaker through
ignorance, instruct him quickly, and initiate him, that he may not go
out and despise you.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p27.4"></span>A Thanksgiving at the Divine Participation.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p28"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p28.1"></span>XXVI</span>. After the participation, <span
id="fr_3457"></span>[3458](#fn_3457.md) give thanks in this manner: We
thank thee, O God and Father of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p29.2"></span>Jesus
our Saviour, for Thy holy name, which Thou hast made to inhabit among
us; and that knowledge, faith, love, and immortality which Thou hast
given us through Thy Son <span id="ix.viii.ii-p29.3"></span>Jesus. Thou,
O Almighty Lord, the God of the universe, hast created the world, and
the things that are therein, by Him; and hast planted a law in our
souls, and beforehand didst prepare things for the convenience of men. O
God of our holy and blameless fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
Thy faithful servants; Thou, O God, who art powerful, faithful, and
true, and without deceit in Thy promises; who didst send upon earth
<span id="ix.viii.ii-p29.4"></span>Jesus Thy Christ to live with men, as
a man, when He was God the Word, and man, to take away error by the
roots: do Thou even now, through Him, be mindful of this Thy holy
Church, which Thou hast purchased with the precious blood of Thy Christ,
and deliver it from all evil, and perfect it in Thy love and Thy truth,
and gather us all together into Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared.
Let this Thy kingdom come. <span id="fr_3458"></span>[3459](#fn_3458.md)
“Hosanna to the Son of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p30.2"></span>David. Blessed
be He that cometh in the name of the Lord” <span
id="fr_3459"></span>[3460](#fn_3459.md) —God the Lord, who was manifested
to us in the flesh. If any one be holy, let him draw near; but if any
one be not such, let him become such by repentance. Permit also to your
presbyters to give thanks.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p31.5"></span>A Thanksgiving About the Mystical Ointment.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p32"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p32.1"></span>XXVII</span>. Concerning the ointment give
thanks in this manner: We give Thee thanks, O God, the Creator of the
whole world, both for the flagrancy of the ointment, and for the
immortality which Thou hast made known to us by Thy Son <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p32.2"></span>Jesus. For Thine is the glory and the power
for ever. Amen. Whosoever comes to you, <span
id="fr_3460"></span>[3461](#fn_3460.md) and gives thanks in this manner,
receive him as a disciple of Christ. But if he preach another doctrine,
different from that which Christ by us has delivered to you, such a one
you must not permit to give thanks; for such a one rather affronts God
than glorifies Him. <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> <span
id="ix.viii.ii-Page_471"></span>  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p33.2"></span>That We Ought Not to Be Indifferent About Communicating.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p34"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p34.1"></span>XXVIII</span>. But whosoever comes to you,
let him be first examined, and then received: for ye have understanding,
and are able to know the right hand from the left, <span
id="fr_3461"></span>[3462](#fn_3461.md) and to distinguish false teachers
from true teachers. But when a teacher comes to you, supply him with
what he wants with all readiness. And even when a false teacher comes,
you shall give him for his necessity, but shall not receive his error.
Nor indeed may ye pray together with him, lest ye be polluted as well as
he. Every true prophet or teacher <span
id="fr_3462"></span>[3463](#fn_3462.md) that comes to you is worthy of his
maintenance, as being a labourer in the word of righteousness. <span
id="fr_3463"></span>[3464](#fn_3463.md)  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p37.2"></span>A Constitution Concerning Oblations.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p38"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p38.1"></span>XXIX</span>. All the first-fruits of the
winepress, the threshing-floor, the oxen, and the sheep, shalt thou give
to the priests, <span id="fr_3464"></span>[3465](#fn_3464.md) that thy
storehouses and garners and the products of thy land may be blessed, and
thou mayst be strengthened with corn and wine and oil, and the herds of
thy cattle and flocks of thy sheep may be increased. Thou shalt give the
tenth of thy increase to the orphan, and to the widow, and to the poor,
and to the stranger. All the first-fruits of thy hot bread, of thy
barrels of wine, or oil, or honey, or nuts, or grapes, or the
first-fruits of other things, shalt thou give to the priests; but those
of silver, and of garments, and of all sort of possessions, to the
orphan and to the widow.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p39.2"></span>How We Ought to Assemble Together, and to Celebrate the Festival Day of Our Saviour’s Resurrection.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p40"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p40.1"></span>XXX</span>. On the day of the resurrection
of the Lord, <span id="fr_3465"></span>[3466](#fn_3465.md) that is, the
Lord’s day, assemble yourselves together, without fail, giving thanks to
God, and praising Him for those mercies God has bestowed upon you
through Christ, and has delivered you from ignorance, error, and
bondage, that your sacrifice may be unspotted, and acceptable to God,
who has said concerning His universal Church: “In every place shall
incense and a pure sacrifice be offered unto me; for I am a great King,
saith the Lord Almighty, and my name is wonderful among the
heathen.” <span id="fr_3466"></span>[3467](#fn_3466.md)  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p42.2"></span>What Qualifications They Ought to Have Who are to Be Ordained.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p43"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p43.1"></span>XXXI</span>. Do you first ordain bishops
worthy of the Lord, <span id="fr_3467"></span>[3468](#fn_3467.md) and
presbyters and deacons, pious men, righteous, meek, free from the love
of money, lovers of truth, approved, holy, not accepters of persons, who
are able to teach the word of piety, and rightly dividing the doctrines
of the Lord. <span id="fr_3468"></span>[3469](#fn_3468.md) And do ye honour
such as your fathers, as your lords, as your benefactors, as the causes
of your well-being. Reprove ye one another, not in anger, but in
mildness, with kindness and peace. Observe all things that are commanded
you by the Lord. Be watchful for your life. <span
id="fr_3469"></span>[3470](#fn_3469.md) “Let your loins be girded about,
and your lights burning, and ye like unto men who wait for their Lord,
when He will come, at even, or in the morning, or at cock-crowing, or at
midnight. For at what hour they think not, the Lord will come; and if
they open to Him, blessed are those servants, because they were found
watching. For He will gird Himself, and will make them to sit down to
meat, and will come forth and serve them.” <span
id="fr_3470"></span>[3471](#fn_3470.md) Watch therefore, and pray, that ye
do not sleep unto death. For your former good deeds will not profit you,
if at the last part of your life you go astray from the true faith.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p47.3"></span>A Prediction Concerning Futurities.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p48"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p48.1"></span>XXXII</span>. For in the last days false
prophets shall be multiplied, and such as corrupt the word; and the
sheep shall be changed into wolves, and love into hatred: for through
the abounding of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold. For men shall
hate, and persecute, and betray one another. And then shall appear the
deceiver of the world, the enemy of the truth, the prince of lies, <span
id="fr_3471"></span>[3472](#fn_3471.md) whom the Lord <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p49.2"></span>Jesus “shall destroy with the spirit of His
mouth, who takes away the wicked with His lips; and many shall be
offended at Him. But they that endure to the end, the same shall be
saved. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
heaven;” <span id="fr_3472"></span>[3473](#fn_3472.md) and afterwards shall
be the voice of a trumpet by the archangel; <span
id="fr_3473"></span>[3474](#fn_3473.md) and in that interval shall be the
revival of those that were asleep. And then shall the Lord come, and all
His saints with Him, <span id="fr_3474"></span>[3475](#fn_3474.md) with a
great concussion above the clouds, with the angels of His power, <span
id="fr_3475"></span>[3476](#fn_3475.md) in the throne of His kingdom, to
condemn <span id="ix.viii.ii-p53.2"></span>the devil, the deceiver of
the world, and to render to every one according to his deeds. “Then
shall the wicked go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous
shall go into life eternal,” <span id="fr_3476"></span>[3477](#fn_3476.md)
to inherit those things “which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor
<span id="page_472">p. 472</span> <span
id="ix.viii.ii-Page_472"></span>have entered into the heart of man, such
things as God hath prepared for them that love Him;” <span
id="fr_3477"></span>[3478](#fn_3477.md) and they shall rejoice in the
kingdom of God, which is in Christ <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p55.2"></span>Jesus. Since we are vouchsafed such great
blessings from Him, let us become His suppliants, and call upon Him by
continual prayer, and say:—  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p55.3"></span>A Prayer Declarative of God’s Various Providence.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p56"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p56.1"></span>XXXIII</span>. Our eternal Saviour, the
King of gods, who alone art almighty, and the Lord, the God of all
beings, and the God of our holy and blameless fathers, and of those
before us; the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob; who art
merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy; to
whom every heart is naked, and by whom every heart is seen, and to whom
every secret thought is revealed: to Thee do the souls of the righteous
cry aloud, upon Thee do the hopes of the godly trust, Thou Father of the
blameless, Thou hearer of the supplication of those that call upon Thee
with uprightness, and who knowest the supplications that are not
uttered: for Thy providence reaches as far as the inmost parts of
mankind; and by Thy knowledge Thou searchest the thoughts of every one,
and in every region of the whole earth the incense of prayer and
supplication is sent up to Thee. O Thou who hast appointed this present
world as a place of combat to righteousness, and hast opened to all the
gate of mercy, and hast demonstrated to every man by implanted
knowledge, and natural judgment, and the admonitions of the law, how the
possession of riches is not everlasting, the ornament of beauty is not
perpetual, our strength and force are easily dissolved; and that all is
vapour and vanity; and that only the good conscience of faith unfeigned
passes through the midst of the heavens, and returning with truth, takes
hold of the right hand of the joy <span
id="fr_3478"></span>[3479](#fn_3478.md) which is to come. And withal,
before the promise of the restoration of all things is accomplished, the
soul itself exults in hope, and is joyful. For from that truth which was
in our forefather <span id="ix.viii.ii-p57.3"></span>Abraham, when he
changed his way Thou didst guide him by a vision, and didst teach him
what kind of state this world is; and knowledge went before his faith,
and faith was the consequence of his knowledge; and the covenant did
follow after his faith. For Thou saidst: “I will make thy seed as the
stars of heaven, and as the sand which is by the seashore.” <span
id="fr_3479"></span>[3480](#fn_3479.md) Moreover, when Thou hadst given him
<span id="ix.viii.ii-p58.2"></span>Isaac, and knewest him to be like him
in his mode of life, Thou wast then called his God, saying: “I will be a
God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.” <span
id="fr_3480"></span>[3481](#fn_3480.md) And when our father <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p59.2"></span>Jacob was sent into Mesopotamia, Thou
showedst him Christ, and by him speakest, saying: “Behold, I am with
thee, and I will increase thee, and multiply thee exceedingly.” <span
id="fr_3481"></span>[3482](#fn_3481.md) And so spakest Thou to <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p60.2"></span>Moses, Thy faithful and holy servant, at
the vision of the bush: “I am He that is; this is my name for ever, and
my memorial for generations of generations.” <span
id="fr_3482"></span>[3483](#fn_3482.md) O Thou great protector of the
posterity of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p61.2"></span>Abraham, Thou art
blessed for ever.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p61.3"></span>A Prayer Declarative of God’s Various Creation.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p62"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p62.1"></span>XXXIV</span>. Thou art blessed, O Lord, the
King of ages, who by Christ hast made the whole world, and by Him in the
beginning didst reduce into order the disordered parts; who dividedst
the waters from the waters by a firmament, and didst put into them a
spirit of life; who didst fix the earth, and stretch out the heaven, and
didst dispose every creature by an accurate constitution. For by Thy
power, O Lord, the world is beautified, the heaven is fixed as an arch
over us, and is rendered illustrious with stars for our comfort in the
darkness. The light also and the sun were begotten for days and the
production of fruit, and the moon for the change of seasons, by its
increase and diminutions; and one was called Night, and the other Day.
And the firmament was exhibited in the midst of the abyss, and Thou
commandedst the waters to be gathered together, and the dry land to
appear. But as for the sea itself, who can possibly describe it, which
comes with fury from the ocean, yet runs back again, being stopped by
the sand at Thy command? For Thou hast said: “Thereby shall her waves be
broken.” <span id="fr_3483"></span>[3484](#fn_3483.md) Thou hast also made
it capable of supporting little and great creatures, and made it
navigable for ships. Then did the earth become green, and was planted
with all sorts of flowers, and the variety of several trees; and the
shining luminaries, the nourishers of those plants, preserve their
unchangeable course, and in nothing depart from Thy command. But where
Thou biddest them, there do they rise and set for signs of the seasons
and of the years, making a constant return of the work of men.
Afterwards the kinds of the several animals were created—those belonging
to the land, to the water, to the air, and both to air and water; and
the artificial wisdom of Thy providence does still impart to every one a
suitable providence. For as He was not unable to produce different
kinds, so neither has He disdained to exercise a <span id="page_473">p.
473</span> <span id="ix.viii.ii-Page_473"></span>different providence
towards every one. And at the conclusion of the creation Thou gavest
direction to Thy Wisdom, and formedst a reasonable creature as the
citizen of the world, saying, “Let us make man after our image, and
after our likeness;” <span id="fr_3484"></span>[3485](#fn_3484.md) and hast
exhibited him as the ornament of the world, and formed him a body out of
the four elements, those primary bodies, but hadst prepared a soul out
of nothing, and bestowedst upon him his five senses, and didst set over
his sensations a mind as the conductor of the soul. And besides all
these things, O Lord God, who can worthily declare the motion of the
rainy clouds, the shining of the lightning, the noise of the thunder, in
order to the supply of proper food, and the most agreeable temperature
of the air? But when man was disobedient, Thou didst deprive him of the
life which should have been his reward. Yet didst Thou not destroy him
for ever, but laidst him to sleep for a time; and Thou didst by oath
call him to a resurrection, and loosedst the bond of death, O Thou
reviver of the dead, through <span id="ix.viii.ii-p64.2"></span>Jesus
Christ, who is our hope.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p64.3"></span>A Prayer, with Thanksgiving, Declarative of God’s Providence Over the Beings He Has Made.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p65"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p65.1"></span>XXXV</span>. Great art thou, O Lord
Almighty, and great is Thy power, and of Thy understanding there is no
number. Our Creator and Saviour, rich in benefits, long-suffering, and
the bestower of mercy, who dost not take away Thy salvation from Thy
creatures: for Thou art good by nature, and sparest sinners, and
invitest them to repentance; for admonition is the effect of Thy bowels
of compassion. For how should we abide if we were required to come to
judgment immediately, when, after so much long-suffering, we hardly get
clear of our miserable condition? The heavens declare Thy dominion, and
the earth shakes with earthquakes, and, hanging upon nothing, declares
Thy unshaken stedfastness. The sea raging with waves, and feeding a
flock of ten thousand creatures, is bounded with sand, as standing in
awe at Thy command, and compels all men to dry out: “How great are Thy
works, O Lord! in wisdom hast Thou made them all: the earth is full of
Thy creation.” <span id="fr_3485"></span>[3486](#fn_3485.md) And the bright
host of angels and the intellectual spirits say to Palmoni, <span
id="fr_3486"></span>[3487](#fn_3486.md) “There is but one holy
Being;” <span id="fr_3487"></span>[3488](#fn_3487.md) and the holy
seraphim, together with the six-winged cherubim, who sing to Thee their
triumphal song, cry out with never-ceasing voices, “Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God of hosts! heaven and earth are full of Thy glory;” <span
id="fr_3488"></span>[3489](#fn_3488.md) and the other multitudes of the
orders, angels archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities,
authorities, and powers cry aloud, and say, “Blessed be the glory of the
Lord out of His place.” <span id="fr_3489"></span>[3490](#fn_3489.md) But
Israel, Thy Church on earth, taken out of the Gentiles, emulating the
heavenly powers night and day, with a full heart and a willing soul
sings, “The chariot of God is ten thousandfold thousands of them that
rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sinai, in the holy place.” <span
id="fr_3490"></span>[3491](#fn_3490.md) The heaven knows Him who fixed it
as a cube of stone, in the form of an arch, upon nothing, who united the
land and water to one another, and scattered the vital air all abroad,
and conjoined fire therewith for warmth, and the comfort against
darkness. The choir of stars strikes us with admiration, declaring Him
that numbers them, and showing Him that names them; the animals declare
Him that puts life into them; the trees show Him that makes them grow:
all which creatures, being made by Thy word, show forth the greatness of
Thy power. Wherefore every man ought to send up an hymn from his very
soul to Thee, through Christ, in the name of all the rest, since He has
power over them all by Thy appointment. For Thou art kind in Thy
benefits, and beneficent in Thy bowels of compassion, who alone art
almighty: for when Thou willest, to be able is present with Thee; for
Thy eternal power both quenches flame, and stops the mouths of lions,
and tames whales, and raises up the sick, and overrules the power of all
things, and overturns the host of enemies, and casts down a people
numbered in their arrogance. Thou art He who art in heaven, He who art
on earth, He who art in the sea, He who art in finite things, Thyself
unconfined by anything. For of Thy majesty there is no boundary; for it
is not ours, O Lord, but the oracle of Thy servant, who said, “And thou
shalt know in thine heart that the Lord thy God He is God in heaven
above, and on earth beneath, and there is none other besides
Thee:” <span id="fr_3491"></span>[3492](#fn_3491.md) for there is no God
besides Thee alone, there is none holy besides Thee, the Lord, the God
of knowledge, the God of the saints, holy above all holy beings; for
they are sanctified by Thy hands. Thou art glorious, and highly exalted,
invisible by nature, and unsearchable in Thy judgments; whose life is
without want, whose duration can never alter or fail, whose operation is
without toil, whose greatness is unlimited, whose excellency is
perpetual, whose habitation is inaccessible, whose dwelling is
unchangeable, whose knowledge is without beginning, whose truth is
immutable, whose work is without assistants, whose dominion cannot be
<span id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span
id="ix.viii.ii-Page_474"></span>taken away, whose monarchy is without
succession, whose kingdom is without end, whose strength is
irresistible, whose army is very numerous: for Thou art the Father of
wisdom, the Creator of the creation, by a Mediator, as the cause; the
Bestower of providence, the Giver of laws, the Supplier of want, the
Punisher of the ungodly, and the Rewarder of the righteous; the God and
Father of Christ, and the Lord of those that are pious towards Him,
whose promise is infallible, whose judgment without bribes, whose
sentiments are immutable, whose piety is incessant, whose thanksgiving
is everlasting, through whom <span id="fr_3492"></span>[3493](#fn_3492.md)
adoration is worthily due to Thee from every rational and holy nature.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p73.2"></span>A Prayer Commemorative of the Incarnation of Christ, and His Various Providence to the Saints.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p74"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p74.1"></span>XXXVI</span>. O Lord Almighty Thou hast
created the world by Christ, and hast appointed the Sabbath in memory
thereof, because that on that day Thou hast made us rest from our works,
for the meditation upon Thy laws. Thou hast also appointed festivals for
the rejoicing of our souls, that we might come into the remembrance of
that wisdom which was created by Thee; how He submitted to be made of a
woman on our account; <span id="fr_3493"></span>[3494](#fn_3493.md) He
appeared in life, and demonstrated Himself in His baptism; how He that
appeared is both God and man; He suffered for us by Thy permission, and
died, and rose again by Thy power: on which account we solemnly assemble
to celebrate the feast of the resurrection on the Lord’s day, and
rejoice on account of Him who has conquered death, and has brought life
and immortality to light. For by Him Thou hast brought home the Gentiles
to Thyself for a peculiar people, the true Israel beloved of God, and
seeing God. For Thou O Lord, broughtest our fathers out of the land of
Egypt, and didst deliver them out of the iron furnace, from clay and
brick-making, and didst redeem them out of the hands of Pharaoh, and of
those under him, and didst lead them through the sea as through dry
land, and didst bear their manners in the wilderness, and bestow on them
all sorts of good things. Thou didst give them the law or decalogue,
which was pronounced by Thy voice and written with Thy hand. Thou didst
enjoin the observation of the Sabbath, not affording them an occasion of
idleness, but an opportunity of piety, for their knowledge of Thy power,
and the prohibition of evils; having limited them as within an holy
circuit for the sake of doctrine, for the rejoicing upon the seventh
period. On this account was there appointed one week, and seven weeks,
and the seventh month, and the seventh year, and the revolution of
these, the jubilee, which is the fiftieth year for remission, that men
might have no occasion to pretend ignorance. <span
id="fr_3494"></span>[3495](#fn_3494.md) On this account He permitted men
every Sabbath to rest, that so no one might be willing to send one word
out of his mouth in anger on the day of the Sabbath. For the Sabbath is
the ceasing of the creation, the completion of the world, the inquiry
after laws, and the grateful praise to God for the blessings He has
bestowed upon men. All which the Lord’s day excels, <span
id="fr_3495"></span>[3496](#fn_3495.md) and shows the Mediator Himself, the
Provider, the Lawgiver, the Cause of the resurrection, the First-born of
the whole creation, God the Word, and man, who was born of Mary alone,
without a man, who lived holily, who was crucified under <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p77.2"></span>Pontius Pilate, and died, and rose again
from the dead. So that the Lord’s day commands us to offer unto Thee, O
Lord, thanksgiving for all. <span id="fr_3496"></span>[3497](#fn_3496.md)
For this is the grace afforded by Thee, which on account of its
greatness has obscured all other blessings.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p78.3"></span>A Prayer Containing the Memorial of His Providence, and an Enumeration of the Various Benefits Afforded the Saints by the Providence of God Through Christ.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p79"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p79.1"></span>XXXVII</span>. Thou who hast fulfilled Thy
promises made by the prophets, and hast had mercy on Zion, and
compassion on Jerusalem, by exalting the throne of <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p79.2"></span>David, Thy servant, in the midst of her, by
the birth of Christ, who was born of his seed according to the flesh, of
a virgin alone; do Thou now, O Lord God, accept the prayers which
proceed from the lips of Thy people which are of the Gentiles, which
call upon Thee in truth, as Thou didst accept of the gifts of the
righteous in their generations. In the first place Thou did respect the
sacrifice of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p79.3"></span>Abel, <span
id="fr_3497"></span>[3498](#fn_3497.md) and accept it as Thou didst accept
of the sacrifice of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p80.2"></span>Noah when he went
out of the ark; <span id="fr_3498"></span>[3499](#fn_3498.md) of <span

##### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p106.3"></span>A Prayer for the Assistance of the Righteous.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p107"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.1"></span>XXXVIII</span>. We give Thee thanks for
all things, O Lord Almighty, that Thou hast not taken away Thy mercies
and Thy compassions from us; but in every succeeding generation Thou
dost save, and deliver, and assist, and protect: for Thou didst assist
in the days of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p107.2"></span>Enos and <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.3"></span>Enoch, in the days of <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.4"></span>Moses and <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.5"></span>Joshua, in the days of the judges, in the
days of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p107.6"></span>Samuel and of <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.7"></span>Elijah and of the prophets, in the days of
<span id="ix.viii.ii-p107.8"></span>David and of the kings, in the days
of <span id="ix.viii.ii-p107.9"></span>Esther and <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.10"></span>Mordecai, in the days of <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.11"></span>Judith, in the days of <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.12"></span>Judas Maccabeus and his brethren, and in
our days hast Thou assisted us by Thy great High Priest, <span
id="ix.viii.ii-p107.13"></span>Jesus Christ Thy Son. For He has
delivered us from the sword, and hath freed us from famine, and
sustained us; has delivered us from sickness, has preserved us from an
evil tongue. For all which things do we give Thee thanks through Christ,
who has given us an articulate voice to confess withal, and added to it
a suitable tongue as an instrument to modulate withal, and a proper
taste, and a suitable touch, and a sight for contemplation, and the
hearing of sounds, and the smelling of vapours, and hands for work, and
feet for walking. And all these members dost Thou form from a little
drop in the womb; and after the formation dost Thou bestow on it an
immortal soul, and producest it into the light as a rational creature,
even man. Thou hast instructed him by Thy laws, improved him by Thy
statutes; and when Thou bringest on a dissolution for a while, Thou hast
promised a resurrection. Wherefore what life is sufficient, what length
of ages will be long enough, for men to be thankful? To do it worthily
it is impossible, but to do it according to our ability is just and
right. For Thou hast delivered us from the impiety of polytheism, and
from the heresy of the murderers of Christ; Thou hast delivered us from
error and ignorance; Thou hast sent Christ among men as a man, being the
only begotten God; Thou hast made the Comforter to inhabit among us;
Thou hast set angels over us; Thou hast put the devil to shame; Thou
hast brought us into being when we were not. Thou takest care of us when
made; Thou measurest out life to us; Thou affordest us food; Thou hast
promised repentance. Glory and worship be to Thee for all these things,
through <span id="ix.viii.ii-p107.14"></span>Jesus Christ, <span
id="fr_3524"></span>[3525](#fn_3524.md) now and ever, and through all ages.
Amen. Meditate on these things, brethren; and the Lord be With you upon
earth, and in the kingdom of His Father, who both sent Him, and has
“delivered us by Him from the bondage of corruption into His glorious
liberty;” <span id="fr_3525"></span>[3526](#fn_3525.md) and has promised
life to those who through Him have believed in the God of the whole
world.
