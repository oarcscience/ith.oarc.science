#### <span id="iii.v.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVII.

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p1"></span>The wicked plan having been carried into
execution, <span id="iii.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Diocletian, whom prosperity
had now abandoned, set out instantly for Rome, <span
id="iii.v.xvii-p1.2"></span>there to celebrate the commencement of the
twentieth year of his reign. That solemnity was performed on the twelfth
of the kalends of December; <span id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976)
and suddenly the emperor, unable to bear the Roman freedom of speech,
peevishly and impatiently burst away from the city. The kalends of
January <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977) approached, at which
day the consulship, for the ninth time, was to be offered to him; yet,
rather than continue thirteen days longer in Rome, he chose that his
first appearance as consul should be at Ravenna. Having, however, begun
his journey in winter, amidst intense cold and incessant rains, he
contracted a slight but lingering disease: it harassed him without
intermission, so that he was obliged for the most part to be carried in
a litter. Then, at the close of summer, he made a circuit along the
banks of the Danube, and so came to Nicomedia. His disease had now
become more grievous and oppressing; yet he caused himself to be brought
out, in order to dedicate that circus which, at the conclusion of the
twentieth year of his reign, he had erected. Immediately he grew so
languid and feeble, that prayers for his life were put up to all the
gods. Then suddenly, on the ides of December, <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978) there was heard in the palace
sorrow, and weeping, and lamentation, and the courtiers ran to and fro;
there was silence throughout the city, and a report went of the death,
and even of the burial, of <span id="iii.v.xvii-p4.1"></span>Diocletian:
but early on the morrow it was suddenly rumoured that he still lived. At
this the countenance of his domestics and courtiers changed from
melancholy to gay. Nevertheless there were who suspected his death to be
kept secret until the arrival of <span
id="iii.v.xvii-p4.2"></span>Galerius Cæsar, lest in the meanwhile the
soldiery should attempt some change in the government; and this
suspicion grew so universal, that no one would believe the emperor
alive, until, on the kalends of March, <span
id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979) he appeared in public, but so wan,
his illness having lasted almost a year, as hardly to be known again.
The fit of stupor, resembling death, happened on the ides of December;
and although he in some measure recovered, yet he never attained to
perfect health again, for he became disordered in his judgment, being at
certain times insane and at others of sound mind.
