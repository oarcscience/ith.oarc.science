#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXI.—Of the Sacred Rites of the Roman Gods.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1"></span>But the senate also instituted
other false gods of this kind,—Hope, Faith, Concord, Peace, Chastity,
Piety; all of which, since they ought truly to be in the minds of men,
they have falsely placed within walls. But although these have no
substantial existence outside of man, nevertheless I should prefer that
they should be worshipped, rather than Blight or Fever, which ought not
to be consecrated, but rather to be execrated; than <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Fornax, together with her sacred
ovens; than <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.2"></span>Stercutus, who first
showed men to enrich the ground with manure; than the goddess <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.3"></span>Muta, who brought forth the <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.4"></span>Lares; than <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.5"></span>Cumina, who presides over the cradles
of infants; than <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.6"></span>Caca, who gave
information to <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.7"></span>Hercules
respecting the stealing of his cattle, that he might slay her brother.
How many other monstrous and <span id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-Page_229"></span>ludicrous fictions there are,
respecting which it is grievous to speak! I do not, however, wish to
omit notice of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.8"></span>Terminus, since
it is related that he did not give way even to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvii-p1.9"></span>Jupiter, though he was an unwrought
stone. They suppose that he has the custody of the boundaries, and
public prayers are offered to him, that he may keep the stone of the
Capitol immoveable, and preserve and extend the boundaries of the Roman
empire.
