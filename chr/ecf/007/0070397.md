### <span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE

###### <span id="vii.i-p1.2"></span>TO

## <span id="vii.i-p1.3"></span>DIONYSIUS, BISHOP OF ROME.

<span id="vii.i-p2"></span> \[<span class="sc"><span
id="vii.i-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 259-269.\] <span
id="vii.i-p2.2"></span>Dionysius is no exception to the rule that Latin
Christianity had no place in Rome till after the Nicene Council. He was
a Greek by birth, and reflects the spirit and orthodoxy of the Greek
Fathers; and what we have from him is written in the Greek language. We
find it in <span id="vii.i-p2.3"></span>Athanasius, where, remarks <span
id="vii.i-p2.4"></span>Waterland, <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332) its genuineness cannot be
suspected, because “<span id="vii.i-p3.2"></span>Athanasius did not
entirely approve of it, and would certainly never have forged an
interpretation different from his own.” He concurred with the Easterns
in the discipline of <span id="vii.i-p3.3"></span>Paul of Samosata.
<span id="vii.i-p3.4"></span>Waterland says of the following fragment:
<span id="vii.i-p3.5"></span>“It is of admirable use for showing the
doctrine of the Trinity as professed by the Church of Christ at that
time.”  

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span>The purely receptive character of the Roman
See during the Ante-Nicene period must be sufficiently apparent to the
possessors of the volumes of this series. Until after the Council of
Nice, as a Roman pontiff has testified, she was unfelt in the churches
as a teaching church. <span id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333) <span
id="vii.i-p5.4"></span>Irenæus has justly stated her case: as the <span
id="vii.i-p5.5"></span>focus of the empire, she was the natural center
of exchange and social commerce among all nations. Thither all
Christians converged, and there at all times might be found
representatives of all the churches,—those of Gaul and Britain; those of
Asia Minor and Syria; those of Alexandria and Egypt; those of North
Africa, where Latin Christianity had begun to exist, and where it had
reached a vigorous maturity at the Nicene period. Hence, from all these
churches came into Rome <span id="vii.i-p5.6"></span>a Catholic
testimony, which was thus preserved at the metropolis by the pressure
from without.  

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span>This is the fact which gives importance to
the earliest dogmatic testimony proceeding from the See of Rome. <span
id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334) <span
id="vii.i-p7.3"></span>Dionysius has the great distinction of sustaining
the orthodoxy which <span id="vii.i-p7.4"></span>Hippolytus and other
comprovincial bishops had established against the heresy of two of his
predecessors; and this little essay, embedded in the works of <span
id="vii.i-p7.5"></span>Athanasius, comes forth as a genuine “bee” out of
his precious amber, sweet with the honey of truth, and pungent with the
sting of an acute and piercing testimony against error.  

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span>For the necessary preface to this essay or
synodical letter, the reader must turn to the history of <span
id="vii.i-p8.1"></span>Dionysius of Alexandria, surnamed the Great, and
to the letters he wrote to his namesake of Rome. <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335) For a complete view of the whole
matter, and for the originals of both these great prelates, the student
will not fail to consult <span id="vii.i-p9.3"></span>Routh. <span
id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336) <span
id="vii.i-p10.2"></span>Athanasius, the touchstone of orthodoxy, does
not altogether commend the idioms of either; but he sustains the
essential orthodoxy of both with that vast sweep of genius which could
insist upon Nicene idioms after the council, but sustain those who, in
defective language, fought previously for essential truth.<span
id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span id="vii.i-Page_364"></span>  

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span>For a just view of <span
id="vii.i-p11.1"></span>Novatian and of the orthodoxy of Rome in the
times of <span id="vii.i-p11.2"></span>Dionysius, as that unhappy but
competent witness sets it forth, the reader would do well to consult Dr.
<span id="vii.i-p11.3"></span>Waterland. <span
id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337) For a vindication of the <span
id="vii.i-p12.2"></span>Alexandrian Dionysius, to whom his
contemporaries gave the surname <span id="vii.i-p12.3"></span>Magnus,
see the same lucid expounder of antiquity. <span
id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338) For a sententious statement of the
<span id="vii.i-p13.2"></span>subordination of the Son, on which so much
hinges in these inquiries, consult the same theologian. <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339)  

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span>I might have suffixed this essay to the
works of the great <span id="vii.i-p15.1"></span>Dionysius but for
several important considerations: (1) I was glad to give due prominence
to this exceptional voice from old Rome, and to place <span
id="vii.i-p15.2"></span>Dionysius with due dignity before the reader;
(2) as the Bishop of Rome was without a hearing at Nicæa, I was anxious
to show what good <span id="vii.i-p15.3"></span>Sylvester would have
said had he been able to attend the council; (3) I was not willing,
therefore, to hide this writer’s light under the bushel of the pages
devoted to the Alexandrian school; (4) I was anxious to close this
important volume by a just exhibition of the Ante-Nicene doctrine,
previous to the compilation of the Great Symbol; (5) I considered it
judicious to elucidate <span id="vii.i-p15.4"></span>Dionysius by the
doctrines of <span id="vii.i-p15.5"></span>Athanasius, to whom we owe
the preservation of the fragment itself; and (6) I felt that here was
the place to record the “Athanasian Confession” (so called), which,
apocryphal though it be, as a “creed” under his name is allowed to
embody the principles for which the whole life of <span
id="vii.i-p15.6"></span>Athanasius was a contest unparalleled in the
history of Christianity.
