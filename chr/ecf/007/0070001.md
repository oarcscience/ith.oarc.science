## <span id="ii-p1.1"></span>Introductory Notice

<span id="ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> genius of <span
id="ii-p2.2"></span>Lactantius suffers a sad transformation when
unclothed of vernacular and stripped of the idiomatic graces of his
style. But the intelligent reader will be sure to compare this
translation with the Latinity of the original, and to recur to it often
for the enjoyment of its charming rhetoric, and of the high sentiment it
so nobly enforces and adorns. This volume will be the favourite of the
series with many. The writings of the Christian <span
id="ii-p2.3"></span>Tully alone make up more than half of its contents;
and it is supremely refreshing to reach, at last, an author who
chronicles the triumph of the Gospel <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)
over “<span id="ii-p3.5"></span>Herod and <span
id="ii-p3.6"></span>Pontius Pilate;” over the heathen in their “rage,”
and the people in their “vain imaginings;” over “the kings of the earth
who stood up, and the rulers who were gathered together against the Lord
and against His Christ.”  

<span id="ii-p4"></span>I love the writings of Lactantius, and two of
his sayings are always uppermost when I recall his name. They touch me
like plaintive but inspiring music. Let me quote them entire: <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) —  

<span id="ii-p6"></span>1. “<span id="ii-p6.1"></span>Si vita est
optanda sapienti profecto nullam aliam ob causam vivere optaverim, quam
ut aliquid efficiam quod vita dignum sit.”  

<span id="ii-p7"></span>2. “<span id="ii-p7.1"></span>Satis me vixisse
arbitrabor, et officium hominis implesse, si labor meus aliquos homines
ab erroribus liberatos, ad iter cœleste direxerit.”  

<span id="ii-p8"></span>The <span id="ii-p8.1"></span>Minor Writers to
be found in this volume are not unworthy of their place. They are
chiefly valuable as an appendix to preceding volumes, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2) and illustrative of their contents.  

<span id="ii-p10"></span>But this series is enriched beyond its original
by the <span id="ii-p10.1"></span>Bryennios Manuscript and the completed
form of the <span id="ii-p10.2"></span>pseudo-Clementine <span
id="ii-p10.3"></span>Epistle<span id="ii-p10.4"></span>, edited by
Professor <span id="ii-p10.5"></span>Riddle. The same hand has annotated
the <span id="ii-p10.6"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, so called; and
the student has in his brief but learned notes all the light which has
been shed by modern scholarship on these invaluable relics of antiquity,
since the days of the truly illustrious <span
id="ii-p10.7"></span>Bishop Beveridge. These, and the liturgical <span
id="ii-p10.8"></span>pseudepigraphic treasures of early Christianity I
have gathered here, to distinguish them from the mere <span
id="ii-p10.9"></span>Apocrypha, which will largely make up the one
remaining volume of the series.  

<span id="ii-p11"></span>Of the <span id="ii-p11.1"></span>Liturgies, I
have said what seemed necessary as an introduction, in the proper
place. <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3) They are debased by mediæval
alloy. In their English dress, and in the nudity of their appearance,
without adequate notes and elucidations, they are therefore far from
attractive specimens of liturgical literature. But it would have been
beyond my province to say much where the original editors have said
nothing, and I have contented myself with such comments only as seemed
requisite to remind the student how to “take forth the precious from the
vile.”

<span id="ii-p9"></span> Thus the Apocalyptic comments of <span
