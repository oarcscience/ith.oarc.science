#### <span id="iii.v.xli-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLI.

<span id="iii.v.xli-p1"></span>But the empress, an exile in some desert
region of Syria, secretly informed her father <span
id="iii.v.xli-p1.1"></span>Diocletian of the calamity that had befallen
her. He despatched messengers to <span id="iii.v.xli-p1.2"></span>Daia,
requesting that his daughter might be sent to him. He could not prevail.
Again and again he entreated; yet she was not sent. At length he
employed a relation of his, a military man high in power and authority,
to implore <span id="iii.v.xli-p1.3"></span>Daia by the remembrance of
past favours. This messenger, equally unsuccessful in his negotiation as
the others, reported to <span id="iii.v.xli-p1.4"></span>Diocletian that
his prayers were vain.
