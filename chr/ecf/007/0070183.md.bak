#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIX.—Of the Advent of Christ to Judgment, and of the Overcoming of the False Prophet.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p1"></span>The world therefore being oppressed,
since the resources of men shall be insufficient for the overthrow of a
tyranny of immense strength, inasmuch as it will press upon the captive
world with great armies of robbers, that calamity so great will stand in
need of divine assistance. Therefore God, being aroused both by the
doubtful danger and by the wretched lamentation of the righteous, will
immediately send a deliverer. Then the middle of the heaven shall be
laid open in the dead and darkness of the night, that the light of the
descending God may be manifest in all the world as lightning: of which
the <span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p1.1"></span>Sibyl spoke in these words:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p1.2"></span> “When He shall come, there will
> be fire and darkness in the midst of the black night.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p2"></span>This is the night which is
celebrated by us in watchfulness on account of the coming of our King
and God: <span id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) of which night there
is a twofold meaning; because in it He then received life when He
suffered, and hereafter He is about to receive the kingdom of the world.
For He is the Deliverer, and Judge, and Avenger, and King, and God, whom
we call Christ, who before He descends will give this sign: There shall
suddenly fall from heaven a sword, that the righteous may know that the
leader of the sacred warfare is about to descend; and He shall descend
with a company of angels to the middle of the earth, and there shall go
before Him an unquenchable fire, and the power of the angels shall
deliver into the hands of the just that multitude which has surrounded
the mountain, and they shall be slain from the third hour until the
evening, and blood shall flow like a torrent; and all his forces being
destroyed, the wicked one shall alone escape, and his power shall perish
from him.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p4"></span>Now this is he who is called
Antichrist; but he shall falsely call himself Christ, and shall fight
against the truth, and being overcome shall flee; and shall often renew
the war, and often be conquered, until in the fourth battle, all the
wicked being slain, subdued, and captured, he shall at length pay the
penalty of his crimes. But other princes also and tyrants who have
harassed the world, together with him, shall be led in chains to the
king; and he shall rebuke them, and reprove them, and upbraid them with
their crimes, and condemn them, and consign them to deserved tortures.
Thus, wickedness being extinguished and impiety suppressed, the world
will be at rest, which having been subject <span id="page_216">p.
216</span> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-Page_216"></span>to error and
wickedness for so many ages, endured dreadful slavery. No longer shall
gods made by the hands be worshipped; but the images being thrust out
from their temples and couches, shall be given to the fire, and shall be
burnt, together with their wonderful gifts: which also the <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p4.1"></span>Sibyl, in accordance with the prophets,
announced as about to take place:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p4.2"></span> “But mortals shall break in
> pieces the images and all the wealth.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p5"></span>The <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p5.1"></span>Erythræan Sibyl also made the same
promise:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xix-p5.2"></span> “And the works made by the hand
> of the gods shall be burnt up.”
