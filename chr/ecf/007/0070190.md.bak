#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXVI.—Of the Loosing of the Devil, and of the Second and Greatest Judgment.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p1"></span>We have said, a little before, that
it will come to pass at the commencement of the sacred reign, that the
prince of the devils will be bound by God. But he also, when the
thousand years of the kingdom, that is, seven thousand <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>of the world, shall begin to be ended,
will be loosed afresh, and being sent forth from prison, will go forth
and assemble all the nations, which shall then be under the dominion of
the righteous, that they may make war against the holy city; and there
shall be collected together from all the world an innumerable company of
the nations, and shall besiege and surround the city. Then the last
anger of God shall come upon the nations, and shall utterly <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) destroy them; and first He shall
shake the earth most violently, and by its motion the mountains of Syria
shall be rent, and the hills shall sink down precipitously, and the
walls of all cities shall fall, and God shall cause the sun to stand, so
that he set not for three days, and shall set it on fire; and excessive
heat and great burning shall descend upon the hostile and impious
people, and showers of brimstone, <span id="page_221">p. 221</span>
<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-Page_221"></span>and hailstones, and drops of
fire; and their spirits shall melt through the heat, and their bodies
shall be bruised by the hail, and they shall smite one another with the
sword. The mountains shall be filled with carcases, and the plains shall
be covered with bones; but the people of God during those three days
shall be concealed under caves of the earth, until the anger of God
against the nations and the last judgment shall be ended.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p3"></span>Then the righteous shall go forth
from their hiding-places, and shall find all things covered with
carcases and bones. But the whole race of the wicked shall utterly
perish; and there shall no longer be any nation in this world, but the
nation of God alone. Then for seven continuous years the woods shall be
untouched, nor shall timber be cut from the mountains, but the arms of
the nations shall be burnt; and now there shall be no war, but peace and
everlasting rest. But when the thousand years shall be completed, the
world shall be renewed by God, and the heavens shall be folded together,
and the earth shall be changed, and God shall transform men into the
similitude of angels, and they shall be white as snow; and they shall
always be employed in the sight of the Almighty, and shall make
offerings to their Lord, and serve Him for ever. At the same time shall
take place that second and public resurrection <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) of all, in which the unrighteous
shall be raised to everlasting punishments. These are they who have
worshipped the works of their own hands, who have either been ignorant
of, or have denied the Lord and Parent of the world. But their lord with
his servants shall be seized and condemned to punishment, together with
whom all the band of the wicked, in accordance with their deeds, shall
be burnt for ever with perpetual fire in the sight of angels and the
righteous.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p5"></span>This is the doctrine of the holy
prophets which we Christians follow; this is our wisdom, which they who
worship frail objects, or maintain an empty philosophy, deride as folly
and vanity, because we are not accustomed to defend and assert it in
public, since God orders us in quietness and silence to hide His secret,
and to keep it within our own conscience; and not to strive with
obstinate contention against those who are ignorant of the truth, and
who rigorously assail God and His religion not for the sake of learning,
but of censuring and jeering. For a mystery ought to be most faithfully
concealed and covered, especially by us, who bear the name of
faith. <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) But they accuse this
silence of ours, as though it were the result of an evil conscience;
whence also they invent some detestable things respecting those who are
holy and blameless, and willingly believe their own inventions.  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.3"></span> The address to <span
> id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.5"></span>Constantine is wanting in some <span
> id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.6"></span>mss. and editions, but is inserted in
> the text by Migne, as found in some important <span
> id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.7"></span>mss., and as in accordance with the
> style and spirit of <span
> id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p6.8"></span>Lactantius.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p7"></span>But all fictions have now been
hushed, most holy Emperor, since the time when the great God raised thee
up for the restoration of the house of justice, and for the protection
of the human race; for while thou rulest the Roman state, we worshippers
of God are no more regarded as accursed and impious. Since the truth now
comes forth <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) from obscurity,
and is brought into light, we are not censured as unrighteous who
endeavour to perform the works of righteousness. No one any longer
reproaches us with the name of God. None of us, who are alone of all men
religious, is any more called irreligious; since despising the images of
the dead, we worship the living and true God. The providence of the
supreme Deity has raised thee to the imperial dignity, that thou
mightest be able with true piety to rescind the injurious decrees of
others, to correct faults, to provide with a father’s clemency for the
safety of men,—in short, to remove the wicked from the state, whom being
cast down by pre-eminent piety, God has delivered into your hands, that
it might be evident to all in what true majesty consists.  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-p9"></span>For they who wished to take away
the worship of the heavenly and matchless <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) God, that they might defend impious
superstitions, lie in ruin. <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md)
But thou, who defendest and lovest His name, excelling in virtue and
prosperity, enjoyest thy immortal glories with the greatest happiness.
They suffer and have suffered the punishment of their guilt. The
powerful right hand of God protects thee from all dangers; He bestows on
thee a quiet and tranquil reign, with the highest congratulations of all
men. And not undeservedly has the Lord and Ruler of the world chosen
thee in preference to all others, by whom He might renew His holy
religion, since thou alone didst exist of all, who mightest afford a
surpassing example of virtue and holiness: in which thou mightest not
only equal, but also, which is a very great matter, excel the glory of
ancient princes, whom nevertheless fame reckons among the good. They
indeed perhaps by nature only resembled the righteous. For he who is
ignorant of God, the Ruler of the universe, may attain to a resemblance
of righteousness, but he cannot attain to righteousness itself. But
thou, both by the innate sanctity of thy character, and by thy
acknowledgment of the truth and of God in every action, dost fully
perform <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) the works of <span
id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxvi-Page_222"></span>righteousness. <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) It was therefore befitting that, in
arranging the condition of the human race, the Deity should make use of
thy authority and service. Whom we supplicate with daily prayers, that
He may especially guard thee whom He has wished to be the guardian of
the world: then that He may inspire thee with a disposition by which
thou mayest always continue in the love of the divine name. For this is
serviceable to all, both to thee for happiness, and to others for
repose.
