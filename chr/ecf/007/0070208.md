#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XX.—Of the Gods Peculiar to the Romans.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1"></span>I have spoken of the religious
rites which are common to all nations. I will now speak of the gods
which the Romans have peculiar to themselves. Who does not know that the
wife of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Faustulus, the nurse of
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.2"></span>Romulus and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.3"></span>Remus, in honour of whom the
Larentinalia were instituted, was a harlot? And for this reason she was
called <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.4"></span>Lupa, and represented in
the form of a wild beast. <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.5"></span>Faula
also and <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.6"></span>Flora were harlots, of
whom the one was the mistress of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.7"></span>Hercules, as <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p1.8"></span>Verrius relates; the other, having
acquired great wealth by her person, made the people her heir, and on
this account the games called Floralia are celebrated in her honour.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Tatius consecrated the statue of a
woman which had been found in the principal sewer, and called it by the
name of the goddess <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.2"></span>Cloacina. The
Romans, being besieged by the Gauls, made engines for throwing weapons
of the hair of women; and on this account they erected an altar and
temple to <span id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p2.3"></span>Venus Calva: <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467) also to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p3.2"></span>Jupiter Pistor, <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) because he had advised them in a
dream to make all their corn into bread, and to throw it upon the enemy;
and when this had been done, the Gauls, despairing of being able to
reduce the Romans by famine, had abandoned the siege. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p4.2"></span>Tullus Hostilius made Fear and Pallor
gods. Mind is also worshipped; but if they had possessed it, they would
never, I believe, have thought that it ought to be worshipped. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xvi-p4.3"></span>Marcellus originated Honour and Virtue.
