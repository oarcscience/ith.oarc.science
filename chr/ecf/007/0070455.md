#### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Sec. III.—The Heresies Attacked by the Apostles.

##### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p0.2"></span>An Exposition of the Preaching of the Apostles.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>XI</span>. But we, who are the children of
God and the sons of peace, do preach the holy and right word of piety,
and declare one only God, the Lord of the law and of the prophets, the
Maker of the world, the Father of Christ; not a being that caused
Himself, or begat Himself, as they suppose, but eternal, and without
original, and inhabiting light inaccessible; not two or three, or
manifold, but eternally one only; not a being that cannot be known or
spoken of, but who was preached by the law and the prophets; the
Almighty, the Supreme Governor of all things, the All-powerful Being;
the God and Father of the Only-begotten, and of the First-born of the
whole creation; one God, the Father of one Son, not of many; the Maker
of one Comforter by Christ, the Maker of the other orders, the one
Creator of the several creatures by Christ, the same their Preserver and
Legislator by Him; the cause of the resurrection, and of the judgment,
and of the retribution which shall be made by Him: that this same Christ
was pleased to become man, and went through life without sin, and
suffered, and rose from the dead, and returned to Him that sent Him. We
also say that every creature of God is good, and nothing abominable;
that everything for the support of life, when it is partaken of
righteously, is very good: for, according to the Scripture, “all things
were very good.” <span id="fr_3206"></span>[3207](#fn_3206.md) We believe
that lawful marriage, and the begetting of children, is honourable and
undefiled; for difference of sexes was formed in <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p2.2"></span>Adam and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p2.3"></span>Eve for the increase of mankind. We
acknowledge with us a soul that is incorporeal and immortal,—not
corruptible as bodies are, but immortal, as being rational and free. We
abhor all unlawful mixtures, and that which is practised by some against
nature as wicked and impious. We profess there will be a resurrection
both of the just and unjust, and a retribution. We profess that Christ
is not a mere man, but God the Word, and man the Mediator between God
and men, the High Priest of the Father; nor are we circumcised with the
Jews, as knowing that He is come “to whom the inheritance was
reserved,” <span id="fr_3207"></span>[3208](#fn_3207.md) and on whose
account the families were kept distinct—“the expectation of the
Gentiles,” <span id="ix.vii.iii-p3.2"></span>Jesus Christ, who sprang
out of Judah, <span id="fr_3208"></span>[3209](#fn_3208.md) the Son from
the branch, the flower from Jesse, whose government is upon His
shoulder. <span id="fr_3209"></span>[3210](#fn_3209.md)  

##### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p5.2"></span>For Those that Confess Christ, But are Desirous to Judaize.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.iii-p6.1"></span>XII</span>. But because this heresy did then
seem the more powerful to seduce men, and the whole Church was in
danger, <span id="fr_3210"></span>[3211](#fn_3210.md) we the twelve
assembled together at Jerusalem (for <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p7.2"></span>Matthias was chosen to be an apostle in the
room of the betrayer, and took the lot of <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p7.3"></span>Judas; as it is said, “His bishopric <span
id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211) let another take”.md). We deliberated,
together with <span id="ix.vii.iii-p8.3"></span>James the Lord’s
brother, what was to be done; and it seemed good to him and to the
elders to speak to the people words of doctrine. For certain men
likewise went down from Judea to Antioch, and taught the brethren who
were there, saying: “Unless ye be circumcised after the manner of <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p8.4"></span>Moses, and walk according to the other
customs which he ordained, ye cannot be saved.” <span
id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212.md) When, therefore, there had been no
small dissension and disputation, the brethren which were at Antioch,
when they knew that we were all met together about this question, sent
out unto us men who were faithful and understanding in the Scriptures to
learn concerning this question. And they, when they were come to
Jerusalem, declared to us what questions were arisen in the church of
Antioch,—namely, that some said men ought to be circumcised, and to
observe the other purifications. And when some said one thing, and some
another, I <span id="ix.vii.iii-p9.2"></span>Peter stood up, and said
unto them: “Men and brethren, ye know how that from ancient days God
made choice among you that the Gentiles should hear the word of the
Gospel by my mouth, and believe; and God, which knoweth the hearts, bare
<span id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span
id="ix.vii.iii-Page_455"></span>them witness. <span
id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213.md) For an angel of the Lord appeared
on a certain time to <span id="ix.vii.iii-p10.2"></span>Cornelius, <span
id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214.md) who was a centurion of the Roman
government, and spake to him concerning me, that he should send for me,
and hear the word of life from my mouth. He therefore sent for me from
Joppa to Cæsarea Stratonis; and when I was ready to go to him, I would
have eaten. And while they made ready I was in the upper room praying;
and I saw heaven opened, and a vessel, knit at the four corners like a
splendid sheet, let down to the earth, wherein were all manner of
four-footed beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the
heaven. And there came a voice out of heaven to me, saying, Arise, <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p11.2"></span>Peter; kill, and eat. And I said, By no
means, Lord: for I have never eaten anything common or unclean. And
there came a voice a second time, saying, What God hath cleansed, that
call not thou common. And this was done thrice, and the vessel was
received up again into heaven. But as I doubted what this vision should
mean, the Spirit said to me, Behold, men seek thee; but rise up, and go
thy way with them, nothing doubting, for I have sent them. <span
id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215.md) These men were those which came
from the centurion, and so by reasoning I understood the word of the
Lord which is written: ‘Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
shall be saved.’ <span id="fr_3216"></span>[3217](#fn_3216.md) And again:
‘All the ends of the earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord, and
all the families of the heathen shall worship before Him: for the
kingdom is in the Lord’s, and He is the governor of the nations.’ <span
id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217.md) And observing that there were
expressions everywhere concerning the calling of the Gentiles, I rose
up, and went with them, and entered into the man’s house. And while I
was preaching the word, the Holy Spirit fell upon him, and upon those
that were with him, as it did upon us at the beginning; and He put no
difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. And I
perceived that God is no respecter of persons; but that in every nation
he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, will be accepted with
Him. But even the believers which were of the circumcision were
astonished at this. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to lay an heavy yoke
upon the neck of the disciples, which neither we nor our fathers were
able to bear? But by the grace of the Lord, we believe we shall be
saved, even as they. <span id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218.md) For the
Lord has loosed us from our bonds, and has made our burden light, and
has loosed the heavy yoke from us by His clemency.” While I spake these
things, the whole multitude kept silence. But <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p15.2"></span>James the Lord’s brother answered and said:
“Men and brethren, hearken unto me; <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p15.3"></span>Simeon hath declared how God at first
visited to take out a people from the Gentiles for His name. And to this
agree the words of the prophets; as it is written: ‘Afterwards I will
return, and will raise again and rebuild the tabernacle of <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p15.4"></span>David, which is fallen down; and I will
rebuild its ruins, and will again set it up, that the residue of men may
seek after the Lord, and all the nations upon whom my name is called,
saith the Lord, who doth these things.’ <span
id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219.md) Known unto God are all His works
from the beginning of the world. Wherefore my sentence is, that we do
not trouble those who from among the Gentiles turn unto God: but to
charge them that they abstain from the pollutions of the Gentiles, and
from what is sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things
strangled, and from fornication; which laws were given to the ancients
who lived before the law, under the law of nature, <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p16.2"></span>Enos, <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p16.3"></span>Enoch, <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p16.4"></span>Noah, <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p16.5"></span>Melchizedek, <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p16.6"></span>Job, and if there be any other of the same
sort.” <span id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220.md) Then it seemed good to
us the apostles, and to <span id="ix.vii.iii-p17.2"></span>James the
bishop, and to the elders, with the whole Church, to send men chosen
from among our own selves, with <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p17.3"></span>Barnabas, and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p17.4"></span>Paul of Tarsus, the apostle of the
Gentiles, and <span id="ix.vii.iii-p17.5"></span>Judas who was called
<span id="ix.vii.iii-p17.6"></span>Barsabbas, and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p17.7"></span>Silas, chief men among the brethren, and
wrote by their hand, as follows: “The apostles, and elders, and
brethren, <span id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221.md) to the brethren of
Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia of the Gentiles, send greeting: Since we
have heard that some from us have troubled you with words, subverting
your souls, to whom we gave no such commandment, it has seemed good to
us, when we were met together with one accord, to send chosen men to
you, with our beloved <span id="ix.vii.iii-p18.2"></span>Barnabas and
<span id="ix.vii.iii-p18.3"></span>Paul, men that have hazarded their
lives for our Lord <span id="ix.vii.iii-p18.4"></span>Jesus Christ, by
whom ye sent unto us. We have sent also with them <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p18.5"></span>Judas and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p18.6"></span>Silas, who shall themselves declare the
same things by mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us,
to lay no other burden upon you than these necessary things; that ye
abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
strangled, and from fornication: from which things if ye keep
yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.” <span
id="fr_3222"></span>[3223](#fn_3222.md) We accordingly sent this epistle;
but we ourselves remained in Jerusalem many days, consulting together
for the public benefit, for the well ordering of all things.  

##### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p19.2"></span>That We Must Separate from Heretics.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p20"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.iii-p20.1"></span>XIII</span>. But after a long time we
visited the brethren, and confirmed them with the word of <span
id="page_456">p. 456</span> <span id="ix.vii.iii-Page_456"></span>piety,
and charged them to avoid those who, under the name of Christ and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p20.2"></span>Moses, war against Christ and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p20.3"></span>Moses, and in the clothing of sheep hide
the wolf. For these are false Christs, and false prophets, and false
apostles, deceivers and corrupters, portions of foxes, the destroyers of
the herbs of the vineyards: “for whose sake the love of many will wax
cold. But he that endureth stedfast to the end, the same shall be
saved.” <span id="fr_3223"></span>[3224](#fn_3223.md) Concerning whom, that
He might secure us, the Lord declared, saying: “There will come to you
men in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall
know them by their fruits; take care of them. For false Christs and
false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many.” <span
id="fr_3224"></span>[3225](#fn_3224.md)  

##### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p22.2"></span>Who Were the Preachers of the Catholic Doctrine, and Which are the Commandments Given by Them.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p23"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.1"></span>XIV</span>. On whose account also we, who
are now assembled in one place,—<span id="ix.vii.iii-p23.2"></span>Peter
and <span id="ix.vii.iii-p23.3"></span>Andrew; <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.4"></span>James and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.5"></span>John, sons of Zebedee; <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.6"></span>Philip and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.7"></span>Bartholomew; <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.8"></span>Thomas and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.9"></span>Matthew; <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.10"></span>James the son of Alphæus, and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.11"></span>Lebbæus who is surnamed <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.12"></span>Thaddæus; and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p23.13"></span>Simon the Canaanite, <span
id="fr_3225"></span>[3226](#fn_3225.md) and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p24.2"></span>Matthias, who instead of <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p24.3"></span>Judas was numbered with us; and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p24.4"></span>James the brother of the Lord and bishop of
Jerusalem, and <span id="ix.vii.iii-p24.5"></span>Paul the teacher of
the Gentiles, the chosen vessel, having all met together, have written
to you this Catholic doctrine for the confirmation of you, to whom the
oversight of the universal Church is committed: wherein we declare unto
you, that there is only one God Almighty, besides whom there is no
other, and that you must worship and adore Him alone, through <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p24.6"></span>Jesus Christ our Lord, in the most holy
Spirit; <span id="fr_3226"></span>[3227](#fn_3226.md) that you are to make
use of the sacred Scriptures, the law, and the prophets; to honour your
parents; to avoid all unlawful actions; to believe the resurrection and
the judgment, and to expect the retribution; and to use all His
creatures with thankfulness, as the works of God, and having no evil in
them; to marry after a lawful manner, for such marriage is unblameable.
For “the woman is suited to the man by the Lord;” <span
id="fr_3227"></span>[3228](#fn_3227.md) and the Lord says: “He that made
them from the beginning, made them male and female; and said, For this
cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto
his wife: and they two shall be one flesh.” <span
id="fr_3228"></span>[3229](#fn_3228.md) Nor let it be esteemed lawful after
marriage to put her away who is without blame. For says He: “Thou shalt
take care to thy spirit, and shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth;
for she is the partner <span id="fr_3229"></span>[3230](#fn_3229.md) of thy
life, and the remains of thy spirit. I and no other have made
her.” <span id="fr_3230"></span>[3231](#fn_3230.md) For the Lord says:
“What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.” <span
id="fr_3231"></span>[3232](#fn_3231.md) For the wife is the partner of
life, united by God unto one body from two. But he that divides that
again into two which is become one, is the enemy of the creation of God,
and the adversary of His providence. In like manner, he that retains her
that is corrupted is a transgressor of the law of nature; since “he that
retains an adulteress is foolish and impious.” <span
id="fr_3232"></span>[3233](#fn_3232.md) For says He, “Cut her off from thy
flesh;” <span id="fr_3233"></span>[3234](#fn_3233.md) for she is not an
help, but a snare, bending her mind from thee to another. Nor be ye
circumcised in your flesh, but let the circumcision which is of the
heart by the Spirit suffice for the faithful; for He says, “Be ye
circumcised to your God, and be circumcised in the foreskin of your
heart.” <span id="fr_3234"></span>[3235](#fn_3234.md)  

##### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p33.2"></span>That We Ought Not to Rebaptize, Nor to Receive that Baptism Which is Given by the Ungodly, Which is Not Baptism, But a Pollution.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p34"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.iii-p34.1"></span>XV</span>. Be ye likewise contented with
one baptism alone, that which is into the death of the Lord; not that
which is conferred by wicked heretics, but that which is conferred by
unblameable priests, “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost:” <span id="fr_3235"></span>[3236](#fn_3235.md) and let not
that which comes from the ungodly be received by you, nor let that which
is done by the godly be disannulled by a second. For as there is one
God, one Christ, and one Comforter, and one death of the Lord in the
body, so let that baptism which is unto Him be but one. But those that
receive polluted baptism from the ungodly will become partners in their
opinions. For they are not priests. For God says to them: “Because thou
hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee from the office of a
priest to me.” <span id="fr_3236"></span>[3237](#fn_3236.md) Nor indeed are
those that are baptized by them initiated, but are polluted, not
receiving the remission of sins, but the bond of impiety. And, besides,
they that attempt to baptize those already initiated crucify the Lord
afresh, slay Him a second time, laugh at divine and ridicule holy
things, affront the Spirit, dishonour the sacred blood of Christ as
common blood, are impious against Him that sent, Him that suffered, and
Him that witnessed. Nay, he that, out of contempt, will not be baptized,
shall be <span id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span
id="ix.vii.iii-Page_457"></span>condemned as an unbeliever, and shall be
reproached as ungrateful and foolish. For the Lord says: “Except a man
be baptized of water and of the Spirit, he shall by no means enter into
the kingdom of heaven.” <span id="fr_3237"></span>[3238](#fn_3237.md) And
again: “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
believeth not shall be damned.” <span
id="fr_3238"></span>[3239](#fn_3238.md) But he that says, When I am dying I
will be baptized, lest I should sin and defile my baptism, is ignorant
of God, and forgetful of his own nature. For “do not thou delay to turn
unto the Lord, for thou knowest not what the next day will bring
forth.” <span id="fr_3239"></span>[3240](#fn_3239.md) Do you also baptize
your infants, and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of God.
For says He: “Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not.” <span id="fr_3240"></span>[3241](#fn_3240.md)  

##### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p40.2"></span>Concerning Books with False Inscriptions.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p41"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.iii-p41.1"></span>XVI.</span> We have sent all these things
to you, that ye may know our opinion, what it is; and that ye may not
receive those books which obtain in our name, but are written by the
ungodly. For you are not to attend to the names of the apostles, but to
the nature of the things, and their settled opinions. For we know that
<span id="ix.vii.iii-p41.2"></span>Simon and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p41.3"></span>Cleobius, and their followers, have
compiled poisonous books under the name of Christ and of His disciples,
and do carry them about in order to deceive you who love Christ, and us
His servants. And among the ancients also some have written apocryphal
books of <span id="ix.vii.iii-p41.4"></span>Moses, and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p41.5"></span>Enoch, and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p41.6"></span>Adam, and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p41.7"></span>Isaiah, and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p41.8"></span>David, and <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p41.9"></span>Elijah, and of the three patriarchs,
pernicious and repugnant to the truth. The same things even now have the
wicked heretics done, reproaching the creation, marriage, providence,
the begetting of children, the law, and the prophets; inscribing certain
barbarous names, and, as they think, of angels, but, to speak the truth,
of demons, which suggest things to them: whose doctrine eschew, that ye
may not be partakers of the punishment due to those that write such
things for the seduction and perdition of the faithful and unblameable
disciples of the Lord <span id="ix.vii.iii-p41.10"></span>Jesus.  

##### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p41.11"></span>Matrimonial Precepts Concerning Clergymen.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p42"></span>XVII. We have already said, that a
bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon, when they are constituted, must be
but once married, whether their wives be alive or whether they be dead;
and that it is not lawful for them, if they are unmarried when they are
ordained, to be married afterwards; or if they be then married, to marry
a second time, but to be content with that wife which they had when they
came to ordination. <span id="fr_3241"></span>[3242](#fn_3241.md) We also
appoint that the ministers, and singers, and readers, and porters, shall
be only once married. But if they entered into the clergy before they
were married, we permit them to marry, if they have an inclination
thereto, lest they sin and incur punishment. <span
id="fr_3242"></span>[3243](#fn_3242.md) But we do not permit any one of the
clergy to take to wife either a courtesan, or a servant, or a widow, or
one that is divorced, as also the law says. Let the deaconess be a pure
virgin; or, at the least, a widow who has been but once married,
faithful, and well esteemed. <span id="fr_3243"></span>[3244](#fn_3243.md)
 

##### <span id="ix.vii.iii-p45.3"></span>An Exhortation Commanding to Avoid the Communion of the Impious Heretics.

<span id="ix.vii.iii-p46"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.iii-p46.1"></span>XVIII</span>. Receive ye the penitent, for
this is the will of God in Christ. Instruct the catechumens in the
elements of religion, and then baptize them. Eschew the antheistical
heretics, who are past repentance, and separate them from the faithful,
and excommunicate them from the Church of God, and charge the faithful
to abstain entirely from them, and not to partake with them either in
sermons or prayers: for these are those that are enemies to the Church,
and lay snares for it; who corrupt the flock, and defile the heritage of
Christ, pretenders only to wisdom, and the vilest of men; concerning
whom <span id="ix.vii.iii-p46.2"></span>Solomon the wise said: “The
wicked doers pretend to act piously.” For, says he, “there is a way
which seemeth right to some, but the ends thereof look to the bottom of
hell.” <span id="fr_3244"></span>[3245](#fn_3244.md) These are they
concerning whom the Lord declared His mind with bitterness and severity,
saying that “they are false Christs and false teachers;” <span
id="fr_3245"></span>[3246](#fn_3245.md) who have blasphemed the Spirit of
grace, and done despite to the gift they had from Him after the grace
<span id="ix.vii.iii-p48.2"></span>of baptism, “to whom forgiveness
shall not be granted, neither in this world nor in that which is to
come;” <span id="fr_3246"></span>[3247](#fn_3246.md) who are both more
wicked than the Jews and more atheistical than the Gentiles; who
blaspheme the God over all, and tread under foot His Son, and do despite
to the doctrine of the Spirit; who deny the words of God, or pretend
hypocritically to receive them, to the affronting of God, and the
deceiving of those that come among them; who abuse the Holy Scriptures,
and as for righteousness, they do not so much as know what it is; who
spoil the Church of God, as the “little foxes do the vineyard;” <span
id="fr_3247"></span>[3248](#fn_3247.md) whom we exhort you to avoid, lest
you lay traps for your own souls. “For he that walketh with wise men
shall be wise, but he that walketh <span id="page_458">p. 458</span>
<span id="ix.vii.iii-Page_458"></span>with the foolish shall be
known.” <span id="fr_3248"></span>[3249](#fn_3248.md) For we ought neither
to run along with a thief, nor put in our lot with an adulterer; since
holy <span id="ix.vii.iii-p51.2"></span>David says: “O Lord, I have
hated them that hate Thee, and I am withered away on account of Thy
enemies. I hated them with a perfect hatred: they were to me as
enemies.” <span id="fr_3249"></span>[3250](#fn_3249.md) And God reproaches
<span id="ix.vii.iii-p52.2"></span>Jehoshaphat with his friendship
towards <span id="ix.vii.iii-p52.3"></span>Ahab, and his league with him
and with <span id="ix.vii.iii-p52.4"></span>Ahaziah, by <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p52.5"></span>Jonah the prophet: “Art thou in friendship
with a sinner? Or dost thou aid him that is hated by the Lord?” <span
id="fr_3250"></span>[3251](#fn_3250.md) “For this cause the wrath of the
Lord would be upon thee suddenly, but that thy heart is found perfect
with the Lord. For this cause the Lord hath spared thee; yet are thy
works shattered, and thy ships broken to pieces.” <span
id="fr_3251"></span>[3252](#fn_3251.md) Eschew therefore their fellowship,
and estrange yourselves from their friendship. For concerning them did
the prophet declare, and say: “It is not lawful to rejoice with the
ungodly,” <span id="fr_3252"></span>[3253](#fn_3252.md) says the Lord. For
these are hidden wolves, dumb dogs, that cannot bark, who at present are
but few, but in process of time, when the end of the world draws nigh,
will be more in number and more troublesome, of whom said the Lord,
“Will the Son of man, when He comes, find faith on the earth?” <span
id="fr_3253"></span>[3254](#fn_3253.md) and, “Because iniquity shall
abound, the love of many shall wax cold;” and, “There shall come false
Christs and false prophets, and shall show signs in the heaven, so as,
if it were possible, to deceive the elect:” <span
id="fr_3254"></span>[3255](#fn_3254.md) from whose deceit God, through
<span id="ix.vii.iii-p57.2"></span>Jesus Christ, who is our hope, will
deliver us. For we ourselves, as we passed through the nations, and
confirmed the churches, curing some with much exhortation and healing
words, restored them again when they were in the certain way to death.
But those that were incurable we cast out from the flock, that they
might not infect the lambs, which were found with their scabby disease,
but might continue before the Lord God pure and undefiled, sound and
unspotted. And this we did in every city, everywhere through the whole
world, and have left to you the bishops and to the rest of the priests
this very Catholic doctrine worthily and righteously, as a memorial or
confirmation to those who have believed in God; and we have sent it by
our fellow-minister <span id="ix.vii.iii-p57.3"></span>Clement, our most
faithful and intimate son in the Lord, together with <span
id="ix.vii.iii-p57.4"></span>Barnabas, and <span
