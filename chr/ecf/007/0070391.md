<span id="vi.ii.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="vi.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>from the seventeenth chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>1–6.
“There came one of the seven angels, which have the seven bowls, and
spake with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of that great
whore who sitteth upon many waters. And I saw the woman drunk with the
blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs.”\] The decrees
of that senate are always accomplished against all, contrary to the
preaching of the true faith; and now already mercy being cast aside,
itself here gave the decree among all nations.  

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>3. “And
I saw the woman herself sitting upon the scarlet-coloured beast, full of
names of blasphemy.”\] But to sit upon the scarlet beast, the author of
murders, is the image of the devil. Where also <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p2.2"></span>is treated of his captivity, concerning which
we have fully considered. I remember, indeed, that this is called
Babylon also in the Apocalypse, on account of confusion; and in Isaiah
also; and <span id="vi.ii.xvi-p2.3"></span>Ezekiel called it Sodom. In
fine, if you compare what is said against Sodom, and what Isaiah says
against Babylon, and what the Apocalypse says, you will find that they
are all one. <span id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307)  

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p4"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvi-p4.1"></span>9. “The
seven heads are the seven hills, on <span id="page_358">p. 358</span>
<span id="vi.ii.xvi-Page_358"></span>which the woman sitteth.”\] That
is, the city of Rome.  

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p5"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.1"></span>10. “And
there are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the other is
not yet come; and when he is come, he will be for a short time.”\] The
time must be understood in which the written Apocalypse was published,
since then reigned <span id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.2"></span>Cæsar Domitian; but
before him had been <span id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.3"></span>Titus his brother,
and <span id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.4"></span>Vespasian, <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.5"></span>Otho, <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.6"></span>Vitellius, and <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.7"></span>Galba. These are the five who have fallen.
One remains, under whom the Apocalypse was written—<span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.8"></span>Domitian, to wit. “The other has not yet
come,” speaks of <span id="vi.ii.xvi-p5.9"></span>Nerva; “and when he is
come, he will be for a short time,” for he did not complete the period
of two years.  

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p6"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvi-p6.1"></span>11. “And
the beast which thou sawest is of the seven.”\] Since before those kings
<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p6.2"></span>Nero reigned.  

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p7"></span>“And he is the eighth.”\] He says only
when this beast shall come, reckon it the eighth place, since in that is
the completion. He added:—  

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p8"></span>“And shall go into perdition.”\] For that
ten kings received royal power when he shall move from the east, he
says. He shall be sent from the city of Rome with his armies. And <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p8.1"></span>Daniel sets forth the ten horns and the ten
diadems. And that these are eradicated from the former ones,—that is,
that three of the principal leaders are killed by Antichrist: that the
other seven give him honour and wisdom and power, of whom he says:—  

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p9"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvi-p9.1"></span>16.
“These shall hate the whore, to wit, the city, and shall burn her flesh
with fire.”\] Now that one of the heads was, as it were, slain to death,
and that the stroke of his death was directed, he speaks of <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p9.2"></span>Nero. For it is plain that when the cavalry
sent by the senate was pursuing him, he himself cut his throat. Him
therefore, when raised up, God will send as a worthy king, but worthy in
such a way as the Jews merited. And since he is to have another name, He
shall also appoint another name, that so the Jews may receive him as if
he were the Christ. Says <span id="vi.ii.xvi-p9.3"></span>Daniel: “He
shall not know the lust of women, although before he was most impure,
and he shall know no God of his fathers: for he will not be able to
seduce the people of the circumcision, unless he is a judge of the
law.” <span id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308) Finally, also, he will
recall the saints, not to the worship of idols, but to undertake
circumcision, and, if he is able, to seduce any; for he shall so conduct
himself as to be called Christ by them. But that he rises again from
hell, we have said above in the word of Isaiah: “Water shall nourish
him, and hell hath increased him;” who, however, must come with name
unchanged, and doings unchanged, as says the Spirit.
