### <span id="x.iii-p0.1"></span>The Homily. <span id="fr_3847"></span>[3848](#fn_3847.md)

##### <span id="x.iii-p1.7"></span>Chap. i.—we ought to think highly of christ.

<span id="x.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.iii-p2.1"></span>Brethren</span>, it is fitting that you should
think of <span id="x.iii-p2.2"></span>Jesus Christ as of God,—as the
Judge of the living and the dead. And it does not become us <span
id="fr_3848"></span>[3849](#fn_3848.md) to think lightly <span
id="fr_3849"></span>[3850](#fn_3849.md) of our salvation; for if we think
little <span id="fr_3850"></span>[3851](#fn_3850.md) of Him, we shall also
hope but to obtain little <span id="x.iii-p5.2"></span>from Him. And
those of us <span id="fr_3851"></span>[3852](#fn_3851.md) who hear
carelessly of these things, as if they were of small importance, commit
sin, not knowing whence we have been called, and by whom, and to what
place, and how much <span id="x.iii-p6.4"></span>Jesus Christ submitted
to suffer for our sakes. What return, then, shall we make to Him? or
what fruit that shall be worthy of that which He has given to us?
For, <span id="fr_3852"></span>[3853](#fn_3852.md) indeed, how great are
the benefits <span id="fr_3853"></span>[3854](#fn_3853.md) which we owe to
Him! He has graciously given us light; as a Father, He has called us
sons; He has saved us when we were ready to perish. What praise, then,
shall we give to Him, or what return shall we make for the things which
we have received? <span id="fr_3854"></span>[3855](#fn_3854.md) We were
deficient <span id="fr_3855"></span>[3856](#fn_3855.md) in understanding,
worshipping stones and wood, and gold, and silver, and brass, the works
of men’s hand; <span id="fr_3856"></span>[3857](#fn_3856.md) and our whole
life was nothing else than death. Involved in blindness, and with such
darkness <span id="fr_3857"></span>[3858](#fn_3857.md) before our eyes, we
have received sight, and through His will have laid aside that cloud by
which we were enveloped. For He had compassion on us, and mercifully
saved us, observing the many errors in which we were entangled, as well
as the destruction to which we were exposed, <span
id="fr_3858"></span>[3859](#fn_3858.md) and that we had <span
id="fr_3859"></span>[3860](#fn_3859.md) no hope of salvation except it came
to us from Him. For He called us when we were not, <span
id="fr_3860"></span>[3861](#fn_3860.md) and willed that out of nothing we
should attain a real existence. <span
id="fr_3861"></span>[3862](#fn_3861.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p16.2"></span>Chap. ii.—the church, formerly barren, is now fruitful.

<span id="x.iii-p17"></span>“Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for she that is desolate
hath many more children than she that hath an husband.” <span
id="fr_3862"></span>[3863](#fn_3862.md) In that He said, “Rejoice, thou
barren that bearest not,” He referred to us, for our Church was barren
before that children were given to her. But when He said, “Cry out, thou
that travailest not,” He means this, that we should sincerely offer up
our prayers to God, and should not, like women in travail, show signs of
weakness. <span id="fr_3863"></span>[3864](#fn_3863.md) And in that He
said, “For she that is desolate hath many more children than she that
hath an husband,” <span id="x.iii-p19.2"></span>He means that <span
id="fr_3864"></span>[3865](#fn_3864.md) our people seemed to be outcast
from God, but now, through believing, have become more numerous than
those who are reckoned to possess God. <span
id="fr_3865"></span>[3866](#fn_3865.md) And another Scripture saith, “I
came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” <span
id="fr_3866"></span>[3867](#fn_3866.md) This means that those who are
perishing must be saved. For it is indeed a great and admirable thing to
establish, not the things which are standing, but these that are
falling. Thus also did Christ desire <span
id="fr_3867"></span>[3868](#fn_3867.md) to save the things which were
perishing, <span id="fr_3868"></span>[3869](#fn_3868.md) and has saved many
by coming and calling us when hastening to destruction. <span
id="fr_3869"></span>[3870](#fn_3869.md) <span id="page_518">p. 518</span>
<span id="x.iii-Page_518"></span>  

##### <span id="x.iii-p25.2"></span>Chap. iii.—the duty of confessing christ.

<span id="x.iii-p26"></span>Since, then, He has displayed so great mercy
towards us, and especially in this respect, that we who are living
should not offer sacrifices to gods that are dead, or pay them worship,
but should attain through Him to the knowledge of the true Father, <span
id="fr_3870"></span>[3871](#fn_3870.md) whereby shall we show that we do
indeed know Him, <span id="fr_3871"></span>[3872](#fn_3871.md) but by not
denying Him through whom this knowledge has been attained? For He
Himself declares, <span id="fr_3872"></span>[3873](#fn_3872.md) “Whosoever
shall confess Me before men, him will I confess before My Father.” <span
id="fr_3873"></span>[3874](#fn_3873.md) This, then, is our reward if we
shall confess Him by whom we have been saved. But in what way shall we
confess Him? By doing what He says, and not transgressing His
commandments, and by honouring Him not with our lips only, but with all
our heart and all our mind. <span id="fr_3874"></span>[3875](#fn_3874.md)
For he says <span id="fr_3875"></span>[3876](#fn_3875.md) in Isaiah, “This
people honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from
Me.” <span id="fr_3876"></span>[3877](#fn_3876.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p33.2"></span>Chap. iv.—true confession of christ.

<span id="x.iii-p34"></span>Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for
that will not save us. For He saith, “Not every one that saith to Me,
Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he that worketh righteousness.” <span
id="fr_3877"></span>[3878](#fn_3877.md) Wherefore, brethren, let us confess
Him by <span id="fr_3878"></span>[3879](#fn_3878.md) our works, by loving
one another, by not committing adultery, or speaking evil of one
another, or cherishing envy; but being continent, compassionate, and
good. We ought also to sympathize with one another, and not be
avaricious. By such <span id="fr_3879"></span>[3880](#fn_3879.md) works let
us confess Him, <span id="fr_3880"></span>[3881](#fn_3880.md) and not by
those that are of an opposite kind. And it is not fitting that we should
fear men, but rather God. For this reason, if we should do such <span
id="x.iii-p38.1"></span>wicked things, the Lord hath said, “Even though
ye were gathered together to Me <span
id="fr_3881"></span>[3882](#fn_3881.md) in My very bosom, yet if ye were
not to keep My commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you,
Depart from Me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of
iniquity.” <span id="fr_3882"></span>[3883](#fn_3882.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p40.3"></span>Chap. v.—this world should be despised.

<span id="x.iii-p41"></span>Wherefore, brethren, leaving <span
id="x.iii-p41.1"></span>willingly our sojourn in this present world, let
us do the will of Him that called us, and not fear to depart out of this
world. For the Lord saith, “Ye shall be as lambs in the midst of
wolves.” <span id="fr_3883"></span>[3884](#fn_3883.md) And <span
id="x.iii-p42.2"></span>Peter answered and said unto Him, <span
id="fr_3884"></span>[3885](#fn_3884.md) “What, then, if the wolves shall
tear in pieces the lambs?” <span id="x.iii-p43.1"></span>Jesus said unto
<span id="x.iii-p43.2"></span>Peter, “The lambs have no cause after they
are dead to fear <span id="fr_3885"></span>[3886](#fn_3885.md) the wolves;
and in like manner, fear not ye them that kill you, and can do nothing
more unto you; but fear Him who, after you are dead, has power over both
soul and body to cast them into hell-fire.” <span
id="fr_3886"></span>[3887](#fn_3886.md) And consider, <span
id="fr_3887"></span>[3888](#fn_3887.md) brethren, that the sojourning in
the flesh in this world is but brief and transient, but the promise of
Christ is great and wonderful, even the rest of the kingdom to come, and
of life everlasting. <span id="fr_3888"></span>[3889](#fn_3888.md) By what
course of conduct, then, shall we attain these things, but by leading a
holy and righteous life, and by deeming these worldly things as not
belonging to us, and not fixing our desires upon them? For if we desire
to possess them, we fall away from the path of righteousness. <span
id="fr_3889"></span>[3890](#fn_3889.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p48.2"></span>Chap. vi.—the present and future worlds are enemies to each other.

<span id="x.iii-p49"></span>Now the Lord declares, “No servant can serve
two masters.” <span id="fr_3890"></span>[3891](#fn_3890.md) If we desire,
then, to Serve both God and mammon, it will be unprofitable for us. “For
what will it profit if a man gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul?” <span id="fr_3891"></span>[3892](#fn_3891.md) This world and the
next are two enemies. The one urges to <span
id="fr_3892"></span>[3893](#fn_3892.md) adultery and corruption, avarice
and deceit; the other bids farewell to these things. We cannot therefore
be the friends of both; and it behoves us, by renouncing the one, to
make sure <span id="fr_3893"></span>[3894](#fn_3893.md) of the other. Let
us reckon <span id="fr_3894"></span>[3895](#fn_3894.md) that it is better
to hate the things present, since they are trifling, and transient, and
corruptible; and to love those <span id="x.iii-p54.3"></span>which are
to come, as being good and incorruptible. For if we do the will of
Christ, we shall find rest; otherwise, nothing shall deliver us from
eternal punishment, if we disobey His commandments. For thus also saith
the Scripture in Ezekiel, “If <span id="x.iii-p54.4"></span>Noah, <span
id="x.iii-p54.5"></span>Job, and <span id="x.iii-p54.6"></span>Daniel
should rise up, they should not deliver their children in
captivity.” <span id="fr_3895"></span>[3896](#fn_3895.md) Now, if men <span
id="page_519">p. 519</span> <span id="x.iii-Page_519"></span>so
eminently righteous <span id="fr_3896"></span>[3897](#fn_3896.md) are not
able by their righteousness to deliver their children, how can we hope
to <span id="fr_3897"></span>[3898](#fn_3897.md) enter into the royal
residence <span id="fr_3898"></span>[3899](#fn_3898.md) of God unless we
keep our baptism holy and undefiled? Or who shall be our advocate,
unless we be found possessed of works of holiness and
righteousness? <span id="fr_3899"></span>[3900](#fn_3899.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p59.1"></span>Chap. vii.—we must strive in order to be crowned.

<span id="x.iii-p60"></span>Wherefore, then, my brethren, let us
struggle <span id="fr_3900"></span>[3901](#fn_3900.md) with all
earnestness, knowing that the contest is <span
id="x.iii-p61.2"></span>in our case close at hand, and that many
undertake long voyages to strive for a corruptible reward; <span
id="fr_3901"></span>[3902](#fn_3901.md) yet all are not crowned, but those
only that have laboured hard and striven gloriously. Let us therefore so
strive, that we may all be crowned. Let us run the straight <span
id="fr_3902"></span>[3903](#fn_3902.md) course, even the race that is
incorruptible; and let us in great numbers set out <span
id="fr_3903"></span>[3904](#fn_3903.md) for it, and strive that we may be
crowned. And should we not all be able to obtain the crown, let us at
least come near to it. We must remember <span
id="fr_3904"></span>[3905](#fn_3904.md) that he who strives in the
corruptible contest, if he be found acting unfairly, <span
id="fr_3905"></span>[3906](#fn_3905.md) is taken away and scourged, and
cast forth from the lists. What then think ye? If one does anything
unseemly in the incorruptible contest, what shall <span
id="x.iii-p66.1"></span>he have to bear? For of those who do not
preserve the seal <span id="fr_3906"></span>[3907](#fn_3906.md) <span
id="x.iii-p67.3"></span>unbroken, the Scripture saith, <span
id="fr_3907"></span>[3908](#fn_3907.md) “Their worm shall not die, and
their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be a spectacle to all
flesh.” <span id="fr_3908"></span>[3909](#fn_3908.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p69.2"></span>Chap. viii.—the necessity of repentance while we are on earth.

<span id="x.iii-p70"></span>As long, therefore, as we are upon earth,
let us practice repentance, for we are as clay in the hand of the
artificer. For as the potter, if he make a vessel, and it be distorted
or broken in his hands, fashions it over again; but if he have before
this cast it into the furnace of fire, can no longer find any help for
it: so let us also, while we are in this world, repent with our whole
heart of the evil deeds we have done in the flesh, that we may be saved
by the Lord, while we have yet an opportunity of repentance. For after
we have gone out of the world, no further power of confessing or
repenting will there belong to us. Wherefore, brethren, by doing the
will of the Father, and keeping the flesh holy, and observing the
commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life. For the Lord
saith in the Gospel, “If ye have not kept that which was small, who will
commit to you the great? For I say unto you, that he that is faithful in
that which is least, is faithful also in much.” <span
id="fr_3909"></span>[3910](#fn_3909.md) This, then, is what He means: “Keep
the flesh holy and the seal undefiled, that ye <span
id="fr_3910"></span>[3911](#fn_3910.md) may receive eternal life.” <span
id="fr_3911"></span>[3912](#fn_3911.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p73.1"></span>Chap. ix.—we shall be judged in the flesh.

<span id="x.iii-p74"></span>And let no one of you say that this very
flesh shall not be judged, nor rise again. Consider ye <span
id="fr_3912"></span>[3913](#fn_3912.md) in what <span
id="x.iii-p75.5"></span>state ye were saved, in what ye received
sight, <span id="fr_3913"></span>[3914](#fn_3913.md) if not while ye were
in this flesh. We must therefore preserve the flesh as the temple of
God. For as ye were called in the flesh, ye shall also come <span
id="x.iii-p76.2"></span>to be judged in the flesh. As Christ <span
id="fr_3914"></span>[3915](#fn_3914.md) the Lord who saved us, though He
was first a Spirit, <span id="fr_3915"></span>[3916](#fn_3915.md) became
flesh, and thus called us, so shall we also receive the reward in this
flesh. Let us therefore love one another, that we may all attain to the
kingdom of God. While we have an opportunity of being healed, let us
yield ourselves to God that healeth us, and give to Him a recompense. Of
what sort? Repentance out of a sincere heart; for He knows all things
beforehand, and is acquainted with what is in our hearts. Let us
therefore give Him praise, <span id="fr_3916"></span>[3917](#fn_3916.md)
not with the mouth only, but also with the heart, that He may accept us
as sons. For the Lord has said, “Those are My brethren who do the will
of My Father.” <span id="fr_3917"></span>[3918](#fn_3917.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p80.2"></span>Chap. x.—vice is to be forsaken, and virtue followed.

<span id="x.iii-p81"></span>Wherefore, my brethren, let us do the will
of the Father who called us, that we may live; and let us
earnestly <span id="fr_3918"></span>[3919](#fn_3918.md) follow after
virtue, but forsake <span id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span
id="x.iii-Page_520"></span>every wicked tendency <span
id="fr_3919"></span>[3920](#fn_3919.md) which would lead into
transgression; and flee from ungodliness, lest evils overtake us. For if
we are diligent in doing good, peace will follow us. On this account,
such men cannot find it, i.e., <span id="x.iii-p83.1"></span>peace, as
are <span id="fr_3920"></span>[3921](#fn_3920.md) influenced by human
terrors, and prefer rather present enjoyment to the promise which shall
afterwards be fulfilled. For they know not what torment present
enjoyment incurs, or what felicity is involved in the future promise.
And if, indeed, they themselves only did such things, it would be <span
id="x.iii-p84.19"></span>the more tolerable; but now they persist in
imbuing innocent souls with their pernicious doctrines, <span
id="fr_3921"></span>[3922](#fn_3921.md) not knowing that they shall receive
a double condemnation, both they and those that hear them.  

##### <span id="x.iii-p85.2"></span>Chap. xi.—we ought to serve god, trusting in his promises.

<span id="x.iii-p86"></span>Let us therefore serve God with a pure
heart, and we shall be righteous; but if we do not serve Him, because we
believe not the promise of God, we shall be miserable. For the prophetic
word also declares, “Wretched are those of a double mind, and who doubt
in their heart, who say, All these things have we heard even in the
times of our fathers; but though we have waited day by day, we have seen
none of them <span id="x.iii-p86.1"></span>accomplished. Ye fools!
compare yourselves to a tree; take, for instance, the vine. First of all
it sheds its leaves, then the bud appears; after that the sour grape,
and then the fully-ripened fruit. So, likewise, my people have borne
disturbances and afflictions, but afterwards shall they receive their
good things.” <span id="fr_3922"></span>[3923](#fn_3922.md) Wherefore, my
brethren, let us not be of a double mind, but let us hope and endure,
that we also may obtain the reward. For He is faithful who has promised
that He will bestow on every one a reward according to his works. If,
therefore, we shall do righteousness in the sight of God, we shall enter
into His kingdom, and shall receive the promises, “which ear hath not
heard, nor eye seen, neither have entered into the heart of man.” <span
id="fr_3923"></span>[3924](#fn_3923.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p88.2"></span>Chap. xii.—we are constantly to look for the kingdom of god.

<span id="x.iii-p89"></span>Let us expect, therefore, hour by hour, the
kingdom of God in love and righteousness, since we know not the day of
the appearing of God. For the Lord Himself, being asked by one when His
kingdom would come, replied, “When two shall be one, and that which is
without as that which is within, and the male with the female, neither
male nor female.” <span id="fr_3924"></span>[3925](#fn_3924.md) Now, two
are one when we speak the truth one to another, and there is unfeignedly
one soul in two bodies. And “that which is without as that which is
within” meaneth this: He calls the soul “that which is within,” and the
body “that which is without.” As, then, thy body is visible to sight, so
also let thy soul be manifest by good works. And “the male with the
female, neither male nor female,” this <span
id="fr_3925"></span>[3926](#fn_3925.md) …  

<span id="x.iii-p92"></span>  

<span id="x.iii-p93"></span> \[The newly recovered portion follows:
\] <span id="fr_3926"></span>[3927](#fn_3926.md) —  

<span id="x.iii-p95"></span>  

<span id="x.iii-p96"></span>… meaneth, <span
id="fr_3927"></span>[3928](#fn_3927.md) that a brother seeing a sister
should think nothing <span id="fr_3928"></span>[3929](#fn_3928.md) about
her as of a female, nor <span id="x.iii-p98.9"></span>she <span
id="fr_3929"></span>[3930](#fn_3929.md) think anything about him as of a
male. If ye do these things, saith He, <span
id="fr_3930"></span>[3931](#fn_3930.md) the kingdom of my Father shall
come.  

##### <span id="x.iii-p100.1"></span>Chap. xiii.—disobedience causeth god’s name to be blasphemed. <span id="fr_3931"></span>[3932](#fn_3931.md)

<span id="x.iii-p102"></span>Therefore, brethren, <span
id="fr_3932"></span>[3933](#fn_3932.md) let us now at length repent; let us
be sober unto what is good; for we are full of much folly and
wickedness. Let us blot out from us our former sins, and repenting from
the soul let us be saved; and let us not become <span
id="fr_3933"></span>[3934](#fn_3933.md) men-pleasers, nor let us desire to
please only one another, <span id="fr_3934"></span>[3935](#fn_3934.md) but
also the men that are without, by our righteousness, that the Name <span
id="fr_3935"></span>[3936](#fn_3935.md) <span id="page_521">p. 521</span>
<span id="x.iii-Page_521"></span>be not blasphemed on account of
us. <span id="fr_3936"></span>[3937](#fn_3936.md) For the Lord also saith
“Continually <span id="fr_3937"></span>[3938](#fn_3937.md) My name is
blasphemed among all the Gentiles,” <span
id="fr_3938"></span>[3939](#fn_3938.md) and again, “Woe <span
id="fr_3939"></span>[3940](#fn_3939.md) to him on account of whom My name
is blasphemed.” Wherein is it blasphemed? In your not doing what I
desire. <span id="fr_3940"></span>[3941](#fn_3940.md) For the Gentiles,
when they hear from our mouth the oracles of God, <span
id="fr_3941"></span>[3942](#fn_3941.md) marvel at them as beautiful and
great; afterwards, when they have learned that our works are not worthy
of the words we speak, they then turn themselves to blasphemy, saying
that it is some fable and delusion. For when they hear from us that God
saith, <span id="fr_3942"></span>[3943](#fn_3942.md) “There is no thank
unto you, if ye love them that love you; but there is thank unto you, if
ye love your enemies and them that hate you;” <span
id="fr_3943"></span>[3944](#fn_3943.md) when they hear these things, they
marvel at the excellency of the goodness; but when they see that we not
only do not love them that hate us, but not even them that love us, they
laugh us to scorn, and the Name is blasphemed.  

##### <span id="x.iii-p114.4"></span>Chap. xiv.—the living church is the body of christ.

<span id="x.iii-p115"></span>Wherefore, <span
id="fr_3944"></span>[3945](#fn_3944.md) brethren, if we do the will of God
our father, we shall be of the first Church, that is, spiritual, that
hath been created before the sun and moon; <span
id="fr_3945"></span>[3946](#fn_3945.md) but if we do not the will of the
Lord, we shall be of the scripture that saith, “My house was made a den
of robbers.” <span id="fr_3946"></span>[3947](#fn_3946.md) So then let us
choose to be of the Church of life, <span
id="fr_3947"></span>[3948](#fn_3947.md) that we may be saved. I do not,
however, suppose ye are ignorant that the living Church is the body of
Christ; <span id="fr_3948"></span>[3949](#fn_3948.md) for the scripture
saith, “God made man, male and female.” <span
id="fr_3949"></span>[3950](#fn_3949.md) the male is Christ, the female is
the Church. And the Books <span id="fr_3950"></span>[3951](#fn_3950.md) and
the Apostles <span id="x.iii-p122.1"></span>plainly declare <span
id="fr_3951"></span>[3952](#fn_3951.md) that the Church is not of the
present, but from the beginning. <span
id="fr_3952"></span>[3953](#fn_3952.md) For she was spiritual, as our <span
id="x.iii-p124.2"></span>Jesus also was, but was manifested in the last
days that He <span id="fr_3953"></span>[3954](#fn_3953.md) might save us.
Now the Church, being spiritual, was manifested in the flesh of Christ,
<span id="x.iii-p125.1"></span>thus signifying to us that, if any of us
keep <span id="fr_3954"></span>[3955](#fn_3954.md) her in the flesh and do
not corrupt her, he shall receive her again <span
id="fr_3955"></span>[3956](#fn_3955.md) in the Holy Spirit: for this flesh
is the copy of the spirit. No one then who corrupts the copy, shall
partake of the original. <span id="fr_3956"></span>[3957](#fn_3956.md) This
then is what He meaneth, “Keep the flesh, <span
id="fr_3957"></span>[3958](#fn_3957.md) that ye may partake of the spirit.”
But if we say that the flesh is the church and the spirit Christ, <span
id="fr_3958"></span>[3959](#fn_3958.md) then he that hath shamefully used
the flesh hath shamefully used the Church. Such a one then shall not
partake of the spirit, which is Christ. Such life and incorruption this
flesh <span id="fr_3959"></span>[3960](#fn_3959.md) can partake of, when
the Holy Spirit is joined to it. No one can utter or speak “what the
lord hath prepared” for his elect. <span
id="fr_3960"></span>[3961](#fn_3960.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p132.2"></span>Chap. xv.—faith and love the proper return to god.

<span id="x.iii-p133"></span>Now I do not think I have given you any
light counsel concerning self-control, <span
id="fr_3961"></span>[3962](#fn_3961.md) which if any one do he will not
repent of it, but will save both himself and me who counselled him. For
it is no light reward to turn again a wandering and perishing soul that
it may be saved. <span id="fr_3962"></span>[3963](#fn_3962.md) For this is
the recompense <span id="fr_3963"></span>[3964](#fn_3963.md) we have to
return to God who created us, if he that speaketh and heareth both
speaketh and heareth with faith and love. Let us therefore abide in the
things which we believed, righteous and holy, that with boldness we may
ask of God who saith, “While thou art yet speaking, I will say, Lo, I am
here.” <span id="fr_3964"></span>[3965](#fn_3964.md) For this saying is the
sign of a great promise; for the Lord saith of Himself that He is more
ready to give than he that asketh <span id="x.iii-p137.2"></span>to
ask. <span id="fr_3965"></span>[3966](#fn_3965.md)  <span
id="fr_3966"></span>[3967](#fn_3966.md) Being <span id="page_522">p.
522</span> <span id="x.iii-Page_522"></span>therefore partakers of so
great kindness, let us not be envious of one another <span
id="fr_3967"></span>[3968](#fn_3967.md) in the obtaining of so many good
things. For as great as is the pleasure which these sayings have for
them that have done them, so great is the condemnation they have for
them that have been disobedient.  

##### <span id="x.iii-p139.2"></span>Chap. xvi.—the excellence of almsgiving.

<span id="x.iii-p140"></span>Wherefore, brethren, having received no
small occasion <span id="fr_3968"></span>[3969](#fn_3968.md) for
repentance, while we have the opportunity, <span
id="fr_3969"></span>[3970](#fn_3969.md)  <span
id="fr_3970"></span>[3971](#fn_3970.md) let us turn unto God that called
us, while we still have Him as One that receiveth us. For if we
renounce <span id="fr_3971"></span>[3972](#fn_3971.md) these enjoyments and
conquer our soul in not doing these its evil desires, we shall partake
of the mercy of <span id="x.iii-p143.2"></span>Jesus. But ye know that
the day of judgment even now “cometh as a burning oven,” <span
id="fr_3972"></span>[3973](#fn_3972.md)  <span
id="fr_3973"></span>[3974](#fn_3973.md) and some “of the heavens shall
melt,” and all the earth <span id="x.iii-p144.2"></span>shall be as lead
melting on the fire, <span id="fr_3974"></span>[3975](#fn_3974.md)  <span
id="fr_3975"></span>[3976](#fn_3975.md) and then the hidden and open works
of men shall appear. Almsgiving therefore is a good thing, as repentance
from sin; fasting is better than prayer, but almsgiving than both; <span
id="fr_3976"></span>[3977](#fn_3976.md)  <span
id="fr_3977"></span>[3978](#fn_3977.md) “but love covereth a multitude of
sins.” <span id="fr_3978"></span>[3979](#fn_3978.md)  <span
id="fr_3979"></span>[3980](#fn_3979.md) But prayer out of a good conscience
delivereth from death. Blessed is every one that is found full of these;
for alms-giving lighteneth the burden of sin. <span
id="fr_3980"></span>[3981](#fn_3980.md)  <span
id="fr_3981"></span>[3982](#fn_3981.md)  

##### <span id="x.iii-p148.3"></span>Chap. xvii.—the danger of impenitence.

<span id="x.iii-p149"></span>Let us therefore repent from the whole
heart, that no one of us perish by the way. For if we have commandments
that we should also practice this, <span
id="fr_3982"></span>[3983](#fn_3982.md) to draw away men from idols and
instruct them, how much more ought a soul already knowing God not to
perish! Let us therefore assist one another that we may also lead up
those weak as to what is good, <span
id="fr_3983"></span>[3984](#fn_3983.md) in order that all may be saved; and
let us convert and admonish one another. <span
id="fr_3984"></span>[3985](#fn_3984.md)  <span
id="fr_3985"></span>[3986](#fn_3985.md) And let us not think to give heed
and believe now only, while we are admonished by the presbyters, but
also when we have returned home, <span
id="fr_3986"></span>[3987](#fn_3986.md)  <span
id="fr_3987"></span>[3988](#fn_3987.md) remembering the commandments <span
id="fr_3988"></span>[3989](#fn_3988.md) of the Lord; and let us not be
dragged away by worldly lusts, but coming <span
id="fr_3989"></span>[3990](#fn_3989.md) more frequently let us attempt to
make advances in the commandments of the Lord, that all being of the
same mind <span id="fr_3990"></span>[3991](#fn_3990.md) we may be gathered
together unto life. For the Lord said, “I come to gather together all
the nations, tribes, and tongues.” <span
id="fr_3991"></span>[3992](#fn_3991.md) This He speaketh of the day of His
appearing, when He shall come and redeem us, each one according to his
works. <span id="fr_3992"></span>[3993](#fn_3992.md) And the unbelievers
“shall see His glory,” and strength; and they shall think it strange
when they see the sovereignty <span id="fr_3993"></span>[3994](#fn_3993.md)
of the world in <span id="x.iii-p159.7"></span>Jesus, saying, Woe unto
us, Thou wast <span id="x.iii-p159.8"></span>He, <span
id="fr_3994"></span>[3995](#fn_3994.md) and we did not know and did not
believe, and we did not obey the presbyters when they declared unto us
concerning our salvation. And “their worm dieth not, and their fire is
not quenched, and they shall be for a spectacle unto all flesh.” <span
id="fr_3995"></span>[3996](#fn_3995.md) He speaketh of that day of
judgment, when they shall see those among us <span
id="fr_3996"></span>[3997](#fn_3996.md) that have been ungodly and acted
deceitfully with the commandments of <span
id="x.iii-p162.3"></span>Jesus Christ. But the righteous who have done
well and endured torments and hated the enjoyments of the soul, when
they shall behold those that have gone astray and denied <span
id="x.iii-p162.4"></span>Jesus through their words or through their
works, how that they are punished with grievous torments in unquenchable
fire, shall be giving glory to God, saying, There will be hope for him
that hath served God with his whole heart.  

##### <span id="x.iii-p162.5"></span>Chap. xviii.—the preacher confesseth his own sinfulness.

<span id="x.iii-p163"></span>Let us also become of the number of them
that give thanks, that have served God, and not of the ungodly that are
judged. For I myself also, being an utter sinner, <span
id="fr_3997"></span>[3998](#fn_3997.md)  <span
id="fr_3998"></span>[3999](#fn_3998.md) and not yet escaped from
temptation, but still being in the midst of the engines <span
id="fr_3999"></span>[4000](#fn_3999.md) of the devil, give diligence to
follow <span id="page_523">p. 523</span> <span
id="x.iii-Page_523"></span>after righteousness, that I may have strength
to come even near it, <span id="fr_4000"></span>[4001](#fn_4000.md) fearing
the judgment to come.  

##### <span id="x.iii-p166.2"></span>Chap. xix.—he justifieth his exhortation.

<span id="x.iii-p167"></span>Wherefore, brethren and sisters, <span
id="fr_4001"></span>[4002](#fn_4001.md) after the God of truth <span
id="x.iii-p168.4"></span>hath been heard, <span
id="fr_4002"></span>[4003](#fn_4002.md) I read to you an entreaty <span
id="fr_4003"></span>[4004](#fn_4003.md) that ye may give heed to the things
that are written, in order that ye may save both yourselves and him that
readeth among you. For as a reward I ask of you that ye repent with the
whole heart, thus giving to yourselves salvation and life. For by doing
this we shall set a goal <span id="fr_4004"></span>[4005](#fn_4004.md) for
all the young who are minded to labour <span
id="fr_4005"></span>[4006](#fn_4005.md) on behalf of piety and the goodness
of God. And let us not, unwise ones that we are, be affronted and sore
displeased, whenever some one admonisheth and turneth us from iniquity
unto righteousness. For sometimes while we are practising evil things we
do not perceive it on account of the double-mindedness and unbelief that
is in our breasts, and we are “darkened in our understanding” <span
id="fr_4006"></span>[4007](#fn_4006.md) by our vain lusts. Let us then
practice righteousness that we may be saved unto the end. Blessed are
they that obey these ordinances. Even if for a little time they suffer
evil in the world, <span id="fr_4007"></span>[4008](#fn_4007.md) they shall
enjoy the immortal fruit of the resurrection. Let not then the godly man
be grieved, if he be wretched in the times that now are; a blessed time
waits for him. He, living again above with the fathers, shall be joyful
for an eternity without grief.  

##### <span id="x.iii-p174.8"></span>Chap. xx.—concluding word of consolation. doxology.

<span id="x.iii-p175"></span>But neither let it trouble your
understanding, that we see the unrighteous having riches and the
servants of God straitened. Let us therefore, brethren and sisters, be
believing: we are striving in the contest <span
id="fr_4008"></span>[4009](#fn_4008.md) of the living God, we are exercised
by the present life, in order that we may be crowned by that to come. No
one of the righteous received fruit speedily, but awaiteth it. For if
God gave shortly the recompense of the righteous, straightway we would
be exercising ourselves in business, not in godliness; for we would seem
to be righteous, while pursuing not what is godly but what is gainful.
And on this account Divine judgment surprised a spirit that was not
righteous, and loaded it with chains. <span
id="fr_4009"></span>[4010](#fn_4009.md)  

<span id="x.iii-p178"></span>To the only God invisible, <span
id="fr_4010"></span>[4011](#fn_4010.md) the Father of truth, who sent forth
to us the Saviour and Prince of incorruption, <span
id="fr_4011"></span>[4012](#fn_4011.md) through whom also He manifested to
us the truth and the heavenly life, to Him be the glory for ever and
ever. Amen. <span id="fr_4012"></span>[4013](#fn_4012.md)

<span id="x.iii-p150"></span> <span id="x.iii-p150.1"></span>Lightfoot,
with Syriac, reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii-p150.2"></span>ἵνα καὶ του̑το πράσσωμεν</span>. <span
id="x.iii-p150.3"></span>Comits <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="fn_3983"></span>[522:3984](0070476.htm#fr_3983.md) <span
id="x.iii-p150.6"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p151"></span> Here <span
id="x.iii-p151.1"></span>Lightfoot thinks a verb has probably fallen out
of the text.

<span id="x.iii-p152"></span> <span id="x.iii-p152.1"></span>Bryennios

<span id="x.iii-p153"></span> “This clearly shows that the work before
us is a sermon delivered in church” (<span
id="x.iii-p153.1"></span>Lightfoot). The preacher is himself one of “the
presbyters;” comp. chap. xix. It is possible, but cannot be proven, that
he was the head of the presbyters, the parochial bishop.

<span id="x.iii-p155"></span> Syriac, “praying,” which <span
id="x.iii-p155.1"></span>Lightfoot thinks may be correct; but <span

very easily be mistaken for <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii-p155.3"></span>προσευχόμενοι</span>. The former means coming
in worship: comp. [Heb. 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md),

phrase “shall see His glory” is from the passage in Isaiah, The language

<span id="x.iii-p159"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

rather “the kingly rule.” <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii-p159.2"></span>ἐν τῷ 'Ιησου̑</span> is rightly explained by
<span id="x.iii-p159.3"></span>Lightfoot, “in the hands, in the power,
of <span id="x.iii-p159.4"></span>Jesus;” <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii-p159.5"></span>ξενισθήσονται</span> is rendered above “shall

the word is rendered “instruments,” and applied to the teeth of the wild

<span id="x.iii-p166"></span> The phrase <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii-p166.1"></span>κἂν ἑγγὺς αυἠτη̑ς</span> implies a doubt of

id="x.iii-p168.5"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p169"></span> If any doubt remained as to the character
of this writing, it would be removed by this sentence. The passage is
elliptical, <span class="Greek"><span id="x.iii-p169.1"></span>μετὰ τὸν
θεὸν τῆς ἀλνθείας</span>, but there is no doubt as to the meaning. The
Scripture was read, and listening to it was regarded as hearing the
voice of God, whose words of truth were read. Then followed the sermon
or exhortation; comp. <span id="x.iii-p169.2"></span>Justin, <span
id="x.iii-p169.3"></span>First Apology, chap. lxvii. (vol. i. p. 186).
That lessons from some at least of the New Testament were included at
the date of this homily, seems quite certain; comp. the references to
the New Testament in chaps. ii., iii., iv., and elsewhere. It is here
implied that this homily was written and “read.”  

<span id="fn_4003"></span>[523:4004](0070476.htm#fr_4003.md) <span

<span id="x.iii-p170"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii-p170.1"></span>ἒντευζις</span>, here used, means intercession,
or supplication, to God (comp. [1 Tim. ii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md)<span id="x.iii-p170.2"></span>, iv.
5) in early Christian literature: but the classical sense is “entreaty:”
so in the opening sentence of <span id="x.iii-p170.3"></span>Justin,
<span id="x.iii-p170.4"></span>First Apology (vol. i. p. 163, where it
is rendered “petition”).

latter is confirmed by the Syriac, and now generally accepted, though
<span id="x.iii-p172.4"></span>Hilgenfeld uses the other reading to
support his view that <span id="x.iii-p172.5"></span>Clement of
Alexandria was the author.

<span id="x.iii-p176"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii-p176.1"></span>πει̑ραν ἀθλου̑μεν</span>; the construction is
classical, and the figure common in all Greek literature.  

<span id="fn_4009"></span>[523:4010](0070476.htm#fr_4009.md) <span
id="x.iii-p176.2"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p177"></span> The verbs here are aorists, and have been
rendered by the English past tense; the present participle (<span
class="Greek"><span id="x.iii-p177.1"></span>μὴ ὂν δίκαιον</span>)
describing the character of the “spirit” must, according to English
usage, conform to the main verbs. <span
id="x.iii-p177.2"></span>Lightfoot says, “The aorist here has its common
<span id="x.iii-p177.3"></span>gnomic sense;” and he therefore
interprets the passage as a general statement: “Sordid motives bring
their own punishment in a judicial blindness.” But this gnomic sense of
the aorist is not common. C reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.iii-p177.4"></span>δεσμός</span>, which yields this sense: “and a
chain weighed <span id="x.iii-p177.5"></span>upon him.” <span
id="x.iii-p177.6"></span>Hilgenfeld refers the passage to those
Christians who suffered persecution for other causes than those of
righteousness. <span id="x.iii-p177.7"></span>Harnack thinks the author
has in mind Satan, as the prince of avarice, and regards him as already
loaded with chains. If the aorist is taken in its usual sense, this is
the preferable explanation; but the meaning is obscure.

<span id="x.iii-p181"></span> The doxology is interesting, as indicating
the early custom of thus closing a homily. The practice, fitting in
itself, naturally followed the examples in the Epistles.
