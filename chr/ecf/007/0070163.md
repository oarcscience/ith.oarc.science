#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXV.—Of Sacrifice, and of an Offering Worthy of God, and of the Form of Praising God.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p1"></span>Now let us speak briefly concerning
sacrifice itself. “Ivory,” says <span
id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Plato, “is not a pure offering to God.”
What then? Are embroidered and costly textures? Nay, rather nothing is a
pure offering to God which can be corrupted or taken away secretly. But
as he saw this, that nothing which was taken from a dead body ought to
be offered to a living being, why did he not see that a corporeal
offering ought not to be presented to an incorporeal being? How much
better and more truly does <span id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p1.2"></span>Seneca
speak: “Will you think of God as great and placid, and a friend to be
reverenced with gentle majesty, and always at hand? not to be worshipped
with the immolation of victims and with much blood—for what pleasure
arises from the slaughter of innocent animals?—but with a pure mind and
with a good and honourable purpose. Temples are not to be built to Him
with stones piled up on high; He is to be consecrated by each man in his
own breast.” Therefore, if any one thinks that garments, and jewels, and
other things which are esteemed precious, are valued by God, he is
altogether ignorant of what God is, since he thinks that those things
are pleasing to Him which even a man would be justly praised for
despising. What, then, is pure, what is worthy of God, but that which He
Himself has demanded in that divine law of His?  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p2"></span>There are two things which ought to
be offered, the gift <span id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269) and the
sacrifice; the gift as a <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span
id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-Page_193"></span>perpetual offering, the sacrifice for
a time. But with those who by no means understand the nature of the
Divine Being, a gift is anything which is wrought of gold or silver;
likewise anything which is woven of purple and silk: a sacrifice is a
victim, and as many things as are burnt upon the altar. But God does not
make use either of the one or the other, because He is free from
corruption, and that is altogether corruptible. Therefore, in each case,
that which is incorporeal must be offered to God, for He accepts this.
His offering is innocency of soul; His sacrifice praise and a
hymn. <span id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270) For if God is not seen,
He ought therefore to be worshipped with things which are not seen.
Therefore no other religion is true but that which consists of virtue
and justice. But in what manner God deals with the justice of man is
easily understood. For if man shall be just, having received
immortality, he will serve God for ever. But that men are not born
except for justice, both the ancient philosophers and even <span
id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p4.2"></span>Cicero suspects. For, discussing the
Laws, <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271) he says: “But of all
things which are discussed by learned men, nothing assuredly is of
greater importance than that it should be entirely understood that we
are born to justice.” We ought therefore to hold forth and offer to God
that alone for the receiving of which He Himself produced us. But how
true this twofold kind of sacrifice is, <span
id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p5.2"></span>Trismegistus Hermes is a befitting
witness, who agrees with us, that is, with the prophets, whom we follow,
as much in fact as in words. He thus spoke concerning justice: “Adore
and worship this word, O son.” But the worship of God consists of one
thing, not to be wicked. Also in that perfect discourse, when he heard
<span id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p5.3"></span>Asclepius inquiring from his son
whether it pleased him that incense and other odours for divine
sacrifice were offered to his father, exclaimed: “Speak words of good
omen, O <span id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p5.4"></span>Asclepius. For it is the
greatest impiety to entertain any such thought concerning that being of
pre-eminent goodness. For these things, and things resembling these, are
not adapted to Him. For He is full of all things, as many as exist, and
He has need of nothing at all. But let us give Him thanks, and adore
Him. For His sacrifice consists only of blessing.” And he spoke
rightly. <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272)  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xxv-p7"></span>For we ought to sacrifice to God in
word; inasmuch as God is the Word, as He Himself confessed. Therefore
the chief ceremonial in the worship of God is praise from the mouth of a
just man directed towards God. <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273) That this, however, may be accepted
by God, there is need of humility, and fear, and devotion in the
greatest degree, lest any one should chance to place confidence in his
integrity and innocence, and thus incur the charge of pride and
arrogance, and by this deed lose the recompense of his virtue. But that
he may obtain the favour of God, and be free from every stain, let him
always implore the mercy of God, and pray for nothing else but pardon
for his sins, even though he has none. <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274) If he desires anything else, there
is no need of expressing it in word to one who knows what we wish; if
anything good shall happen to him, let him give thanks; if any evil, let
him make amends, <span id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275) and let him
confess that the evil has happened to him on account of his faults; and
even in evils let him nothing less give thanks, and make amends in good
things, that he may be the same at all times, and be firm, and
unchangeable, and unshaken. And let him not suppose that this is to be
done by him only in the temple, but at home, and even in his very bed.
In short, let him always have God with himself, consecrated in his
heart, inasmuch as he himself is a temple of God. But if he has served
God, his Father and Lord, with this assiduity, obedience, and devotion,
justice is complete and perfect; and he who shall keep this, as we
before testified, has obeyed God, and has satisfied the obligations of
religion and his own duty.
