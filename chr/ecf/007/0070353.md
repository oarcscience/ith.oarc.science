#### <span id="iii.v.xliv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLIV.

<span id="iii.v.xliv-p1"></span>And now a civil war broke out between
<span id="iii.v.xliv-p1.1"></span>Constantine and <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p1.2"></span>Maxentius. Although <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p1.3"></span>Maxentius kept himself within Rome, because
the soothsayers had foretold that if he went out of it he should perish,
yet he conducted the military operations by able generals. In forces he
exceeded his adversary; for he had not only his father’s army, which
deserted from <span id="iii.v.xliv-p1.4"></span>Severus, but also his
own, which he had lately drawn together out of Mauritania and Italy.
They fought, and the troops of <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p1.5"></span>Maxentius prevailed. At length <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p1.6"></span>Constantine, with steady courage and a mind
prepared for every event, led his whole forces to the neighbourhood of
Rome, and encamped them opposite to the Milvian bridge. The anniversary
of the reign of <span id="iii.v.xliv-p1.7"></span>Maxentius approached,
that is, the sixth of the kalends of November, <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992) and the fifth year of his reign was
drawing to an end.  

<span id="iii.v.xliv-p3"></span><span
id="iii.v.xliv-p3.1"></span>Constantine was directed in a dream to cause
<span id="iii.v.xliv-p3.2"></span>the heavenly sign to be delineated on
the shields of his soldiers, and so to proceed to battle. He did as he
had been commanded, and he marked on their shields the letter Χ, with a
perpendicular line drawn through it and turned round thus at the top,
being the cipher of <span id="iii.v.xliv-p3.3"></span>Christ. Having
this sign (ΧР ), his troops stood to arms. The enemies advanced, but
without their emperor, and they crossed the bridge. The armies met, and
fought with the utmost exertions of valour, and firmly maintained their
ground. In the meantime a sedition arose at Rome, and <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p3.4"></span>Maxentius was reviled as one who had
abandoned all concern for the safety of the commonweal; and suddenly,
while he exhibited the Circensian games on the anniversary of his reign,
the people cried with one voice, “<span
id="iii.v.xliv-p3.5"></span>Constantine cannot be overcome!” Dismayed at
this, <span id="iii.v.xliv-p3.6"></span>Maxentius burst from the
assembly, and having called some senators together, ordered the
Sibylline books to be searched. In them it was found that:—  

> <span id="iii.v.xliv-p3.7"></span> “On the same day the enemy of the
> Romans should perish.”  

<span id="iii.v.xliv-p4"></span>Led by this response to the hopes of
victory, he went to the field. The bridge in his rear was broken down.
At sight of that the battle grew hotter. The hand of the Lord prevailed,
and the forces of <span id="iii.v.xliv-p4.1"></span>Maxentius were
routed. He fled towards the broken bridge; but the multitude pressing on
him, he was driven headlong into the Tiber.  

<span id="iii.v.xliv-p5"></span>This destructive war being ended, <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p5.1"></span>Constantine was acknowledged as emperor,
with great rejoicings, by the senate and people of Rome. And now he came
to know the perfidy of <span id="iii.v.xliv-p5.2"></span>Daia; for he
found the letters written to <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p5.3"></span>Maxentius, and saw the statues and portraits
of the two associates which had been set up together. The senate, in
reward of the valour of <span id="iii.v.xliv-p5.4"></span>Constantine,
decreed to him the title of <span id="iii.v.xliv-p5.5"></span>Maximus
(the Greatest), a title which <span id="iii.v.xliv-p5.6"></span>Daia had
always arrogated to himself. <span id="iii.v.xliv-p5.7"></span>Daia,
when he heard that <span id="iii.v.xliv-p5.8"></span>Constantine was
victorious and Rome freed, expressed as much sorrow as if he himself had
been vanquished; but afterwards, when he heard of the decree of the
senate, he grew outrageous, avowed enmity towards <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p5.9"></span>Constantine, and made his title of <span
id="iii.v.xliv-p5.10"></span>the Greatest a theme of abuse and raillery.
