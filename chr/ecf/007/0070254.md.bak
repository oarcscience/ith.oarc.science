#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.lxii-p0.1"></span>Chap. LXVI.—Of Faith in Religion, and of Fortitude.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.lxii-p1"></span>Faith also is a great part of
justice; and this ought especially to be preserved by us, who bear the
name of faith, especially in religion, because God is before and to be
preferred to man. And if it is a glorious thing to undergo death in
behalf of friends, of parents, and of children, that is, in behalf of
man, and if he who has done this obtains lasting memory and praise, how
much more so in behalf of God, who is able to bestow eternal life in
return for temporal death? Therefore, when a necessity of this kind
happens, that we are compelled to turn aside from God, and to pass over
to the rites of the heathens, no fear, no terror should turn us aside
from guarding the faith delivered to us. Let God be before our eyes, in
our heart, by whose inward help we may overcome the pain of our flesh,
and the torments applied to our body. Then let us think of nothing else
but the rewards of an immortal life. And thus, even though our limbs
should be torn in pieces, or burnt, we shall easily endure all things
which the madness of tyrannical cruelty shall contrive against us.
Lastly, let us strive to undergo death itself, not unwillingly or
timidly, but willingly and undauntedly, as those who know what glory we
are about to have in the presence of God, having triumphed over the
world and coming to the things promised us; with what good things and
how great blessedness we shall be compensated for these brief evils of
punishments, and the injuries of this life. But if the opportunity of
this glory shall be wanting, faith will have its reward even in peace.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.lxii-p2"></span>Therefore let it be observed in
all the duties of life, let it be observed in marriage. For it is not
sufficient if you abstain from another’s bed, or from the brothel. Let
him who has a wife seek nothing further, but, content with her alone,
let him guard the mysteries of the marriage-bed chaste and undefiled.
For he is equally an adulterer in the sight of God and impure, who,
having thrown off the yoke, wantons in strange pleasure either with a
free woman or a slave. But as a woman is bound by the bonds of chastity
not to desire any other man, so let the husband be bound by the same
law, since God has joined together the husband and the wife in the union
of one body. On this account He has commanded that the wife shall not be
put away unless convicted of adultery, and that the bond of the conjugal
compact shall never be dissolved, unless unfaithfulness have broken
it. <span id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) This also is added for
the completion of chastity, that <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lxii-Page_251"></span>there should be an absence not
only of the offence, but even of the thought. For it is evident that the
mind is polluted by the desire, though unaccomplished; and so that a
just man ought neither to do, nor to wish to do, that which is unjust.
Therefore the conscience must be cleansed; for God, who cannot be
deceived, inspects it. The breast must be cleared from every stain, that
it may be a temple of God, which is enlightened not by the gleam of gold
or ivory, but by the brightness of faith and purity.
