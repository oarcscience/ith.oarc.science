#### <span id="viii.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X. <span id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) —Prayer After Communion.

<span id="viii.iii.x-p2"></span>1. But after ye are filled, <span
id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md) thus give thanks: 2. We thank Thee,
holy Father, for Thy holy name which Thou didst cause to tabernacle in
our hearts, and for the knowledge and faith and immortality, which Thou
madest known to us through <span id="viii.iii.x-p3.8"></span>Jesus Thy
Servant; to Thee be the glory for ever. 3. Thou, Master almighty, didst
create all things for Thy name’s sake; Thou gavest food and drink to men
for enjoyment, that they might give thanks to Thee; but to us Thou didst
freely give spiritual food and drink and life eternal through Thy
Servant. <span id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) 4. Before all things
we thank Thee that Thou art mighty; to Thee be the glory for ever. 5.
Remember, Lord, Thy Church, to deliver it from all evil and to make it
perfect in Thy love, and gather it from the four winds, sanctified for
Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared for it; <span
id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463.md) for Thine is the power and the
glory for ever. 6. Let grace come, and let this world pass away. <span
id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464) Hosanna to the God (Son.md) <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) of <span
id="viii.iii.x-p7.5"></span>David! If any one is holy, let him come; if
any one is not so, let him repent. <span
id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) Maran atha. <span
id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md) Amen. 7. But permit the prophets to
make Thanksgiving as much as they desire. <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md)

<span id="fn_2460"></span>[380:2461](0070418.htm#fr_2460.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p0.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p1"></span> This post-communion thanksgiving is f
ound in <span id="viii.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, vii.
26, but with many omissions, alterations, and additions. Still, the
correspondence in thought and language is very remarkable. <span
id="viii.iii.x-p1.2"></span>Schaff cites a similar prayer at the
Passover (after the Hallel cup).  

<span id="fn_2461"></span>[380:2462](0070418.htm#fr_2461.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p3"></span> “After the participation” (<span
id="viii.iii.x-p3.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions) points to a
distinct Eucharistic service. Here the Lord’s Supper is evidently
connected with the <span class="Foreign"><span
id="viii.iii.x-p3.2"></span>Agape</span> \[a noteworthy suggestion\];
comp. [1 Cor. xi. 20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#020.md)<span
id="viii.iii.x-p3.3"></span>, 33. This is an evidence of early date;
comp. <span id="viii.iii.x-p3.4"></span>Justin Martyr, <span
id="viii.iii.x-p3.5"></span>Apol. i. chaps. 64–66, where the Lord’s
Supper is shown to be distinct (<span
id="viii.iii.x-p3.6"></span>Ante-Nicene Fathers, i. pp. 185, 186).  

<span id="fn_2462"></span>[380:2463](0070418.htm#fr_2462.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p3.9"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p4"></span> This last clause has no parallel in
<span id="viii.iii.x-p4.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, and points to
an earlier and more spiritual conception of the Eucharist. Verse 4 also
is peculiar to this passage.  

<span id="fn_2463"></span>[380:2464](0070418.htm#fr_2463.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p4.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p5"></span> The above rendering follows <span
id="viii.iii.x-p5.1"></span>Bryennios; that of <span
id="viii.iii.x-p5.2"></span>Harnack (formerly accepted by <span
id="viii.iii.x-p5.3"></span>Hall and <span
id="viii.iii.x-p5.4"></span>Napier) is: “Gather it, sanctified, from the
four winds, into Thy kingdom,” etc. The phrase “from the four winds”
recalls [Matt. xxiv. 31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md)<span
id="viii.iii.x-p5.5"></span>.  

<span id="fn_2464"></span>[380:2465](0070418.htm#fr_2464.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p5.6"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p6"></span> This is peculiar; but comp. [1 Cor.
vii. 31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031.md)<span
id="viii.iii.x-p6.1"></span> for the last clause.  

<span id="fn_2465"></span>[380:2466](0070418.htm#fr_2465.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p6.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p7"></span> The Codex reads <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.x-p7.1"></span>τῷ ὺεῷ</span>, which
<span id="viii.iii.x-p7.2"></span>Bryennios alters to <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.x-p7.3"></span>τῷ ὺιῷ</span>. The
former is the more difficult reading, and is defended by <span
id="viii.iii.x-p7.4"></span>Harnack.  

<span id="fn_2466"></span>[380:2467](0070418.htm#fr_2466.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p7.6"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p8"></span> This exhortation indicates a mixed
assembly; comp. <span id="viii.iii.x-p8.1"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions. \[If so, it belongs to the <span class="Foreign"><span
id="viii.iii.x-p8.2"></span>Agape</span>.\]  

<span id="fn_2467"></span>[380:2468](0070418.htm#fr_2467.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p8.3"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p9"></span> Cor. xvi. 22, Revised Version, margin:
“That is, <span id="viii.iii.x-p9.1"></span>our Lord cometh.” Comp.
[Rev. xxii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020.md)<span
id="viii.iii.x-p9.2"></span>.  

<span id="fn_2468"></span>[380:2469](0070418.htm#fr_2468.md) <span
id="viii.iii.x-p9.3"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.x-p10"></span> A limitation as compared with 1 Cor.
Xiv. 29, 31, and yet indicating a combination of extemporaneous devotion
with the liturgical form. The verse prepares the way for the next
chapter.
