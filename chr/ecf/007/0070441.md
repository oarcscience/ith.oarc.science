<span id="ix.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> calm and patient course of the
Church in gradually obliterating slavery has been well defended by the
pious Spanish Ultramontane writer <span
id="ix.iii.ix-p2.2"></span>Jacques Balmès. <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864) Of course, he imagines that “the
Catholic Church,” which wrought the change, was his own Tridentine
Communion, <span id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865) <span
id="ix.iii.ix-p4.1"></span>Lecky’s remarks on the gladiators and slavery
as the product of famines and distress are worthy of note, and even he
is forced to recognise the ameliorating influences of Christianity from
the beginning. <span id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866) He says:—  

<span id="ix.iii.ix-p6"></span>“Christianity for the first time made
charity a rudimentary virtue, giving it a foremost place in the moral
type and in the exhortations of its teachers. Besides its general
influence in stimulating the affections, it effected a complete
revolution in this sphere, by representing the poor as the special
representatives of the Christian founder, and thus making the love of
Christ rather than the love of man the principle of charity. Even in the
days of persecution, collections for the relief of the poor were made at
the Sunday meetings. The <span id="ix.iii.ix-p6.1"></span>agapæ, or
feasts of love, were intended mainly for the poor; and food that was
saved by the fasts was devoted to their benefit. A vast organization of
charity, presided over by the bishops, and actively directed by the
deacons, soon ramified over Christendom, till the bond of charity became
the bond of unity, and the most distant sections of the Christian Church
corresponded by the interchange of mercy. <span
id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867) Long before the era of Constantine
it was observed that the charities of the Christians were so
extensive—it may perhaps be said so excessive—that they drew very many
impostors to the Church; and, when the victory of Christianity was
achieved, the enthusiasm for charity displayed itself in the erection of
numerous institutions that were altogether unknown to the pagan world.”
