### <span id="vi.i-p1.1"></span>ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD <span id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md)

<span id="vi.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.i-p3.1"></span>To</span> me, as I meditate and consider in my
mind concerning the creation of this world in which we are kept
enclosed, even such is the rapidity of that creation; as is contained in
the book of <span id="vi.i-p3.2"></span>Moses, which he wrote about its
creation, and which is called Genesis. God produced that entire mass for
the adornment of His majesty in six days; on the seventh to which He
consecrated it . . . with a blessing. For this reason, therefore,
because in the septenary number of days both heavenly and earthly things
are ordered, in place of the beginning I will consider of this seventh
day after the principle of all matters pertaining to the number of
seven; and as far as I shall be able, I will endeavour to portray the
day of <span id="vi.i-p3.3"></span>the divine power to that
consummation.  

<span id="vi.i-p4"></span>In the beginning God made the light, and
divided it in the exact measure of twelve hours by day and by night, for
this reason, doubtless, that day might bring over the night as an
occasion of rest for men’s labours; that, again, day might overcome, and
thus that labour might be refreshed with this alternate change of rest,
and that repose again might be tempered by the exercise of day. “On the
fourth day He made two lights in the heaven, the greater and the lesser,
that the one might rule over the day, the other over the night,” <span
id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196.md) —<span id="vi.i-p5.2"></span>the
lights of the sun and moon and He placed the rest of the stars in
heaven, that they might shine upon the earth, and by their positions
distinguish the seasons, and years, and months, and days, and hours.  

<span id="vi.i-p6"></span>Now is manifested the reason of the truth why
the fourth day is called the Tetras, why we fast even to the ninth hour,
or even to the evening, or why there should be a passing over even to
the next day. Therefore this world of ours is composed of four
elements—fire, water, heaven, earth. These four elements, therefore,
form the quaternion of times or seasons. The sun, also, and the moon
constitute throughout the space of the year four seasons—of spring,
summer, autumn, winter; and these seasons make a quaternion. And to
proceed further still from that principle, lo, there are four living
creatures before God’s throne, <span
id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197.md) four Gospels, four rivers flowing
in paradise; <span id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198.md) four generations
of people from <span id="vi.i-p8.2"></span>Adam to <span
id="vi.i-p8.3"></span>Noah, from <span id="vi.i-p8.4"></span>Noah to
<span id="vi.i-p8.5"></span>Abraham, from <span
id="vi.i-p8.6"></span>Abraham to <span id="vi.i-p8.7"></span>Moses, from
<span id="vi.i-p8.8"></span>Moses to Christ the Lord, the Son of God;
and four living creatures, <span id="vi.i-p8.9"></span>viz., a man, a
calf, a lion, an eagle; and four rivers, the Pison, the Gihon, the
Tigris, and the Euphrates. The man Christ <span
id="vi.i-p8.10"></span>Jesus, the originator of these things whereof we
have above spoken, was taken prisoner by wicked hands, by a quaternion
<span id="vi.i-p8.11"></span>of soldiers. Therefore on account of His
captivity by a quaternion, on account of the majesty of His works,—that
the seasons also, wholesome to humanity, joyful for the harvests,
tranquil for the tempests, may roll on,—therefore we make <span
id="vi.i-p8.12"></span>the fourth day a station or a supernumerary fast.
 

<span id="vi.i-p9"></span>On the fifth day the land and water brought
forth their progenies. On the sixth day the things that were wanting
were created; and thus God raised up man from the soil, as lord of all
the things which He created upon the earth and the water. Yet He created
angels and archangels before He created man, placing spiritual beings
before earthly ones. For light was made before sky and the earth. This
sixth day is called <span id="vi.i-p9.1"></span>parasceve, <span
id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md) that is to say, the preparation of
the kingdom. For He perfected Adam, whom <span id="vi.i-p10.2"></span>He
made after His image and likeness. But for this reason He completed His
works before He created angels and fashioned man, lest perchance they
should falsely assert that they had been His helpers. On this day also,
on account of the passion of the Lord <span id="vi.i-p10.3"></span>Jesus
Christ, we make either a station to God, or a fast. On the seventh day
He rested from all His works, and blessed it, and sanctified it. On the
former day we are accustomed to fast rigorously, that on the Lord’s day
we may go forth <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="vi.i-Page_342"></span>to our bread with giving of thanks. And let
the <span id="vi.i-p10.4"></span>parasceve become a rigorous fast, lest
we should appear to observe any Sabbath with the Jews, which Christ
Himself, the Lord of the Sabbath, says by His prophets that “His soul
hateth;” <span id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md) which Sabbath He in
His body abolished, although, nevertheless, He had formerly Himself
commanded <span id="vi.i-p11.2"></span>Moses that circumcision should
not pass over the eighth day, which day very frequently happens on the
Sabbath, as we read written in the Gospel. <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201.md) <span id="vi.i-p12.2"></span>Moses,
foreseeing the hardness of that people, on the Sabbath raised up his
hands, therefore, and thus <span id="vi.i-p12.3"></span>figuratively
fastened himself to a cross. <span id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202.md)
And in the battle they were sought for by the foreigners on the
Sabbath-day, that they might be taken captive, and, as if by the very
strictness of the law, might be fashioned to the avoidance of its
teaching. <span id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203.md)  

<span id="vi.i-p15"></span>And thus in the sixth Psalm for the eighth
day, <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204.md) <span
id="vi.i-p16.5"></span>David asks the Lord that He would not rebuke him
in His anger, nor judge him in His fury; for this is indeed the eighth
day of that future judgment, which will pass beyond the order of the
sevenfold arrangement. <span id="vi.i-p16.6"></span>Jesus also, the son
of Nave, the successor of <span id="vi.i-p16.7"></span>Moses, himself
broke the Sabbath-day; for on the Sabbath-day he commanded the children
of Israel <span id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md) to go round the
walls of the city of Jericho with trumpets, and declare war against the
aliens. <span id="vi.i-p17.2"></span>Matthias <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md) also, prince of Judah, broke the
Sabbath; for he slew the prefect of <span
id="vi.i-p18.1"></span>Antiochus the king of Syria on the Sabbath, and
subdued the foreigners by pursuing them. And in Matthew we read, that it
is written Isaiah also and the rest of his colleagues broke the
Sabbath <span id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) —that that true and
just Sabbath should be observed in the seventh millenary of years.
Wherefore to those seven days the Lord attributed to each a thousand
years; for thus went the warning: “In Thine eyes, O Lord, a thousand
years are as one day.” <span id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md)
Therefore in the eyes of the Lord each thousand of years is ordained,
for I find that the Lord’s eyes are seven. <span
id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md) Wherefore, as I have narrated, that
true Sabbath will be in the seventh millenary of years, when Christ with
His elect shall reign. Moreover, the seven heavens agree with those
days; for thus we are warned: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens
made, and all the powers of them by the spirit of His mouth.” <span
id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md) There are seven spirits. Their
names are the spirits which abode on the Christ of God, as was intimated
in Isaiah the prophet: “And there rests upon Him the spirit of wisdom
and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
wisdom <span id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) and of piety, and the
spirit of God’s fear hath filled Him.” <span
id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212.md) Therefore the highest heaven is the
heaven of wisdom; the second, of understanding; the third, of counsel;
the fourth, of might; the fifth, of knowledge; the sixth, of piety; the
seventh, of God’s fear. From this, therefore, the thunders bellow, the
lightnings are kindled, <span id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md) the
fires are heaped together; fiery darts <span
id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) appear, stars gleam, the anxiety
caused by the dreadful comet is aroused. <span
id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215.md) Sometimes it happens that the sun
and moon approach one another, and cause those more than frightful
appearances, radiating with light in the field of their aspect. But the
author of the whole creation is <span id="vi.i-p27.1"></span>Jesus. His
name is the Word; for thus His Father says: “My heart hath emitted a
good word.” <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md) <span
id="vi.i-p28.3"></span>John the evangelist thus says: “In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same
was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without
Him was nothing made that was made.” <span
id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md) Therefore, first, was made the
creation; secondly, man, the lord of the human race, as says the
apostle. <span id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218.md) Therefore this Word,
when it made light, is called Wisdom; when it made the sky,
Understanding; when it made land and sea, Counsel; when it made sun and
moon and other bright things, Power; when it calls forth land and sea,
Knowledge; when it formed man, Piety; when it blesses and sanctifies
man, it has the name of God’s fear.  

<span id="vi.i-p31"></span>Behold the seven horns of the Lamb, <span
id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219.md) the seven eyes of God <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220.md) —the seven eyes are the seven
spirits of the Lamb; <span id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221.md) seven
torches burning before the throne of God <span
id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222.md) seven golden candlesticks, <span
id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223.md) seven young sheep, <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md) the seven women in Isaiah, <span
id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225.md) the seven churches in <span
id="vi.i-p38.2"></span>Paul, <span id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226.md)
seven deacons, <span id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227.md) seven
angels, <span id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228.md) seven trumpets, <span
id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229.md) seven seals to the book, seven
periods of seven days with which Pentecost is completed, the seven weeks
in <span id="vi.i-p42.3"></span>Daniel, <span
id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230.md) also the forty-three weeks in <span
id="vi.i-p43.2"></span>Daniel; <span
id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231.md) with <span
id="vi.i-p44.2"></span>Noah, seven of all clean <span id="page_343">p.
343</span> <span id="vi.i-Page_343"></span>things in the ark; <span
id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232.md) seven revenges of <span
id="vi.i-p45.2"></span>Cain, <span id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233.md)
seven years for a debt to be acquitted, <span
id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234.md) the lamp with seven orifices, <span
id="fr_2235"></span>[2236](#fn_2235.md) seven pillars of wisdom in the
house of <span id="vi.i-p48.2"></span>Solomon. <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236.md)  

<span id="vi.i-p50"></span>Now, therefore, you may see that it is being
told you of the unerring glory of God in providence; yet, as far as my
small capacity shall be able, I will endeavour to set it forth. That He
might re-create that Adam by means of the week, and bring aid to His
entire creation, was accomplished by the nativity of His Son <span
id="vi.i-p50.1"></span>Jesus Christ our Lord. Who, then, that is taught
in the law of God, who that is filled with the Holy Spirit, does not see
in his heart, that on the same day on which the dragon seduced <span
id="vi.i-p50.2"></span>Eve, the angel <span
id="vi.i-p50.3"></span>Gabriel brought the glad tidings to the <span
id="vi.i-p50.4"></span>Virgin Mary; that on the same day the Holy Spirit
overflowed the <span id="vi.i-p50.5"></span>Virgin Mary, on which He
made light; that on that day He was incarnate in flesh, in which He made
the land and water; that on the same day He was put to the breast, on
which He made the stars; that on the same day He was circumcised, <span
id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237.md) on which the land and water brought
forth their offspring; that on the same day He was incarnated, on which
He formed man out of the ground; that on the same day Christ was born,
on which He formed man; that on that day He suffered, on which <span
id="vi.i-p51.1"></span>Adam fell; that on the same day He rose again
from the dead, on which He created light? He, moreover, consummates His
humanity in the number seven: of His nativity, His infancy, His boyhood,
His youth, His young-manhood, His mature age, His death. I have also set
forth His humanity to the Jews in these manners: since He is hungry, is
thirsty; since He gave food and drink; since He walks, and retired;
since He slept upon a pillow; <span id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238.md)
since, moreover, He walks upon the stormy seas with His feet, He
commands the winds, He cures the sick and restores the lame, He raises
the blind by His speech, <span id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239.md) —see
ye that He declares Himself to them to be the Lord.  

<span id="vi.i-p54"></span>The day, as I have above related, is divided
into two parts by the number twelve—by the twelve hours of day and
night; and by these hours too, months, and years, and seasons, and ages
are computed. Therefore, doubtless, there are appointed also twelve
angels of the day and twelve angels of the night, in accordance, to wit,
with the number of hours. For these are the twenty-four witnesses of the
days and nights <span id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md) which sit
before the throne of God, having golden crowns on their heads, whom the
Apocalypse of John the apostle and evangelist calls elders, for the
reason that they are older both than the other angels and than men.
