#### <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>General Note by the American Editor.

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Just</span> here I economize a little spare
room to note the cynical <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p1.2"></span>Gibbon’s
ideas about <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p1.3"></span>Lactantius and his works.
He quotes him freely, and recognises his Ciceronian Latinity, and even
the elegance of his rhetoric, and the spirit and eloquence with which he
can garnish the “dismal tale” of coming judgments, based on the
Apocalypse. But then, again <span id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945.md)
he speaks of him as an “obscure rhetorician,” and affects a doubt as to
his sources of information, notably in doubting the conversation between
<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p2.1"></span>Galerius and <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p2.2"></span>Diocletian which forced the latter to
abdicate. This is before he decides to attribute the work on the <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p2.3"></span>Deaths of Persecutors to somebody else, or,
rather, to quote its author ambiguously as <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p2.4"></span>Cæcilius. And here we may insert what he
says on this subject, as follows:—  

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p3"></span>“It is certain that this…was composed
and published while <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p3.1"></span>Licinius,
sovereign of the East, still preserved the friendship of <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p3.2"></span>Constantine and of the Christians. Every
reader of taste must perceive that the style is of a very different and
inferior character to that of <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p3.3"></span>Lactantius; and such, indeed, is the
judgment of <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p3.4"></span>Le Clerc <span
id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946.md) and <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p4.2"></span>Lardner. <span
id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947.md) Three arguments (from the title of
the book and from the names of <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p5.2"></span>Donatus
and <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p5.3"></span>Cæcilius) are produced by the
advocates of <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p5.4"></span>Lactantius. <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948.md) Each of these proofs is, singly,
weak and defective; <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p6.2"></span>but their
concurrence has great weight. I have often fluctuated, and shall <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p6.3"></span>tamely <span
id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949.md) follow the Colbert <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p7.1"></span>ms. in calling the author, whoever he was,
<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p7.2"></span>Cæcilius.”  

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p8"></span>After this the critic adheres to this
ambiguity. I have no wish to argue otherwise. Quite as important are his
notes on the <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p8.1"></span>Institutes. He states the
probable conjecture of <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p8.2"></span>two original
editions,—the one under <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p8.3"></span>Diocletian,
and the other under <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p8.4"></span>Licinius. Then he
says: <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950.md) —  

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p10"></span>“I am <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p10.1"></span>almost convinced that <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p10.2"></span>Lactantius dedicated his <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p10.3"></span>Institutions to the sovereign of Gaul at a
time when <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p10.4"></span>Galerius, <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p10.5"></span>Maximin, and even <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p10.6"></span>Licinius, persecuted the Christians; that
is, between the years <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p10.7"></span>a.d. 306 and
<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p10.8"></span>a.d. 311.”  

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p11"></span>On the dubious passages <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951.md) he remarks: <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952.md) —  

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p14"></span>“The first and most important of these
is, indeed, wanting in twenty-eight <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p14.1"></span>mss., but is found in nineteen. If we weigh
the comparative value of those <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p14.2"></span>mss.,
one, … in the King of France’s library, <span
id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md) may be alleged in its favour. But
the passage is omitted in the correct <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p15.1"></span>ms. of Bologna, which the <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p15.2"></span>Père de Montfaucon <span
id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md) ascribes to the sixth or seventh
century. The taste of most of the editors <span
id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md) has <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p17.2"></span>felt the genuine style of <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p17.3"></span>Lactantius.”  

<span id="iii.iv.xxi-p18"></span>Do not many indications point to the
natural suggestion of a <span id="iii.iv.xxi-p18.1"></span>third
original edition, issued after the conversion of <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p18.2"></span>Constantine? Or the questionable passages
may be the interpolations of <span
id="iii.iv.xxi-p18.3"></span>Lactantius himself.
