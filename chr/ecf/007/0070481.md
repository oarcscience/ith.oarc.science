### <span id="xii.iii-p1.1"></span>The Divine Liturgy of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark, <span id="fr_4149"></span>[4150](#fn_4149) The Disciple of the Holy Peter. <span id="fr_4150"></span>[4151](#fn_4150.md)

<span id="xii.iii-p4"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p5"></span><span id="xii.iii-p5.1"></span>I. Peace be
to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p6"></span>The People.

<span id="xii.iii-p10"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p11"></span>Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy; Lord,
have mercy.  

<span id="xii.iii-p12"></span>The Priest prays secretly: <span
id="fr_4151"></span>[4152](#fn_4151.md)  <span
id="fr_4152"></span>[4153](#fn_4152.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p14"></span>We give Thee thanks, yea, more than
thanks, O Lord our God, the Father of our Lord and God and Saviour <span
id="xii.iii-p14.1"></span>Jesus Christ, for all Thy goodness at all
times and in all places, because Thou hast shielded, rescued, helped,
and guided us all the days of our lives, and brought us unto this hour,
permitting us again to stand before Thee in Thy holy place, that we may
implore forgiveness of our sins and propitiation to all Thy people. We
pray and beseech Thee, merciful God, to grant in Thy goodness that we
may spend this holy day <span id="fr_4153"></span>[4154](#fn_4153.md) and
all the time of our lives without sin, in fulness of joy, health,
safety, holiness, and reverence of Thee. But all envy, all fear, all
temptation, all the influence of Satan, all the snares of wicked men, do
Thou, O Lord, drive away from us, and from Thy Holy Catholic and
Apostolic Church. Bestow upon us, O Lord, what is good and meet.
Whatever sin we commit in thought, word, or deed, do Thou in Thy
goodness and mercy be pleased to pardon. Leave us not, O Lord, while we
hope in Thee; nor lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil
one and from his works, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine
only-begotten Son.  

<span id="xii.iii-p16"></span><span id="xii.iii-p16.1"></span>(In a loud
voice.<span id="xii.iii-p16.2"></span>)

Lord and God and Saviour <span id="xii.iii-p31.1"></span>Jesus Christ,
we pray and beseech Thee to grant that our king may enjoy peace, and be
just and brave. Subdue under him, O God, all his adversaries and
enemies. Gird on thy shield and armour, and rise to his aid. Give him
the victory, O God, that his heart may be set on peace and the praise of
Thy holy name, that we too <span id="fr_4156"></span>[4157](#fn_4156.md) in
his peaceful reign <span id="fr_4157"></span>[4158](#fn_4157.md) may spend
a calm and tranquil life in all reverence and godly fear, through the
grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son:

<span id="xii.iii-p48"></span>O Sovereign and Almighty God, the Father
of our Lord, God, and Saviour <span id="xii.iii-p48.1"></span>Jesus
Christ, we pray and beseech Thee to defend in Thy good mercy our most
holy and blessed high priest our Father <span
id="xii.iii-p48.2"></span>in God <span id="xii.iii-p48.3"></span>Δ, and
our most reverend Bishop <span id="xii.iii-p48.4"></span>Δ. Preserve
them for us through many years in peace, while they according to Thy
holy and blessed will fulfil the sacred priesthood committed to their
care, and dispense aright the word of truth; with all the orthodox
bishops, elders, deacons, sub-deacons, readers, singers, and laity, with
the entire body of the Holy and only Catholic Church. Graciously bestow
upon them peace, health, and salvation. The prayers they offer up for
us, and we for them, do Thou, O Lord, receive at Thy holy, heavenly, and
reasonable altar. But all the enemies of Thy Holy Church put Thou
speedily under their feet, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine
only-begotten Son:  

<span id="xii.iii-p49"></span><span
id="xii.iii-p49.1"></span>(Aloud.<span id="xii.iii-p49.2"></span>)

id="fr_4159"></span>[4160](#fn_4159.md) and pray.  

<span id="xii.iii-p60"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p61"></span>Lord have mercy (<span

<span id="xii.iii-p62"></span>The Priest offers up the prayer of
entrance, <span id="fr_4160"></span>[4161](#fn_4160.md) and for incense.  

<span id="xii.iii-p64"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p65"></span>O Sovereign Lord our God, who hast chosen
the lamp of the twelve apostles with its twelve lights, and hast sent
them forth to proclaim throughout the whole world and teach the Gospel
of Thy kingdom, and to heal sickness and every weakness among the
people, and hast breathed upon their faces and said unto them, Receive
the Holy Spirit the Comforter: whosesoever sins ye remit, they are
remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained:
Breathe also Thy Holy Spirit upon us Thy servants, who, standing around,
are about to enter on Thy holy service, <span
id="fr_4161"></span>[4162](#fn_4161.md) upon the bishops, elders, deacons,
readers, singers, and laity, with the entire body of the Holy Catholic
and Apostolic Church.  

<span id="xii.iii-p67"></span>From the curse and execration, from
condemnation, imprisonment, and banishment, and from the portion of the
adversary;  

<span id="xii.iii-p68"></span>O Lord, deliver us.  

<span id="xii.iii-p69"></span>Purify our lives and cleanse our hearts
from all pollution and from all wickedness, that with pure heart and
conscience we may offer to Thee this incense for a sweet-smelling
savour, and for the remission of our sins and the sins of all Thy
people, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son:  

<span id="xii.iii-p70"></span>(Aloud.)  

<span id="xii.iii-p71"></span>Through whom and with whom be the glory
and the power to Thee, with Thy all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit,
now, henceforth, and for evermore.  

<span id="xii.iii-p72"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p73"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p74"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p75"></span>V. Stand.  

<span id="xii.iii-p76"></span>They sing:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p77"></span>Only-begotten Son and Word, <span
id="fr_4162"></span>[4163](#fn_4162.md) etc.  

<span id="xii.iii-p79"></span>The Gospel is carried in, and the Deacon
says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p80"></span>Let us pray.  

<span id="xii.iii-p81"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p82"></span>Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p83"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p84"></span>And to thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p85"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p86"></span>Let us pray.  

<span id="xii.iii-p87"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p88"></span>Lord, have mercy.  

<span id="xii.iii-p89"></span>The Priest says the prayer of the
Trisagion.  

<span id="xii.iii-p90"></span>O Sovereign Lord Christ <span
id="xii.iii-p90.1"></span>Jesus, the co-eternal Word of the eternal
Father, who wast made in all things like as we are, but without sin, for
the salvation of our race; who hast sent forth Thy holy disciples and
apostles to proclaim and teach the Gospel of Thy kingdom, and to heal
all disease, all sickness among Thy people, be pleased now, O Lord, to
send forth Thy light and Thy truth. Enlighten the eyes of our minds,
that we may understand Thy divine oracles. Fit us to become hearers, and
not only hearers, but doers of Thy word, that we, becoming fruitful, and
yielding good fruit from thirty to an hundred fold, may be deemed worthy
of the kingdom of heaven. <span id="page_553">p. 553</span> <span
id="xii.iii-Page_553"></span>  

<span id="xii.iii-p91"></span><span
id="xii.iii-p91.1"></span>(Aloud.<span id="xii.iii-p91.2"></span>)  

<span id="xii.iii-p92"></span>Let Thy mercy speedily overtake us, O
Lord. For Thou art the bringer of good tidings, the Saviour and Guardian
of our souls and bodies; and we offer glory, thanks, and the <span
class="Foreign"><span id="xii.iii-p92.1"></span>Trisagion</span> to
Thee, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now, henceforth, and for
evermore.  

<span id="xii.iii-p93"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p94"></span>Amen. Holy God, holy mighty, holy
immortal. Holy, holy, holy, <span id="fr_4163"></span>[4164](#fn_4163.md)
etc.  

<span id="xii.iii-p96"></span>VI. After the Trisagion the Priest makes
the sign of the cross over the people, and says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p97"></span>Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p98"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p99"></span>And to thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p100"></span>Then follow the Let us attend; <span
id="fr_4164"></span>[4165](#fn_4164.md) The Apostle and Prologue of the
Hallelujah. <span id="fr_4165"></span>[4166](#fn_4165.md) The Deacons,
after a prescribed form, say:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p103"></span>Lord, bless us. <span
id="fr_4166"></span>[4167](#fn_4166.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p105"></span>The Priest says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p106"></span>May the Lord <span
id="fr_4167"></span>[4168](#fn_4167.md) in His mercy bless and help us,
now, henceforth, and for evermore.  

<span id="xii.iii-p108"></span>The Priest, before the Gospel is read,
offers incense, <span id="fr_4168"></span>[4169](#fn_4168.md) and says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p110"></span>Accept at Thy holy, heavenly, and
reasonable altar, O Lord, the incense we offer in presence of Thy sacred
glory. Send down upon us in return the grace of Thy Holy Spirit, for
Thou art blessed, and let Thy glory encircle us.  

<span id="xii.iii-p111"></span>VII. The Deacon, when he is about to read
the Gospel, says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p112"></span>Lord, bless us.  

<span id="xii.iii-p113"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p114"></span>May the Lord, who is the blessed God,
bless and strengthen us, and make us hearers of His holy Gospel, now,
henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p115"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p116"></span>Stand and let us hear the holy Gospel.  

<span id="xii.iii-p117"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p118"></span>Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p119"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p120"></span>And to thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p121"></span>VIII. The Deacon reads the Gospel, and
the Priest says the prayer of the Collect. <span
id="fr_4169"></span>[4170](#fn_4169.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p123"></span>Look down in mercy and compassion, O
Lord, and heal the sick among Thy people.  

<span id="xii.iii-p124"></span>May all our brethren who have gone or who
are about to go abroad, safely reach their destination in due season.  

<span id="xii.iii-p125"></span>Send down the gracious rain upon the
thirsty lands, and make the rivers <span
id="fr_4170"></span>[4171](#fn_4170.md) flow in full stream, according to
Thy grace.  

<span id="xii.iii-p127"></span>The fruits of the land do Thou, O Lord,
fill with seed and make ripe for the harvest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p128"></span>In peace, courage, justice, and
tranquillity preserve the kingdom of Thy servant, whom Thou hast deemed
worthy to reign over this land.  

<span id="xii.iii-p129"></span>From evil days, from famine and
pestilence, from the assault of barbarians, defend, O Lord, this
Christ-loving city, lowly and worthy of Thy compassion, as Thou didst
spare Nineveh of old.  

<span id="xii.iii-p130"></span>For Thou art full of mercy and
compassion, and rememberest not the iniquities of men against them.  

<span id="xii.iii-p131"></span>Thou hast said through Thy prophet
Isaiah,—I will defend this city, to save it for mine own sake, and for
my servant <span id="xii.iii-p131.1"></span>David’s sake.  

<span id="xii.iii-p132"></span>Wherefore we pray and beseech Thee to
defend in Thy good mercy this city, for the sake of the martyr and
evangelist <span id="xii.iii-p132.1"></span>Mark, who has shown us the
way of salvation through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine
only-begotten Son.  

<span id="xii.iii-p133"></span>(Aloud.)  

<span id="xii.iii-p134"></span>Through whom and with whom be glory and
power to Thee, with Thy all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p135"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p136"></span>IX. Begin.  

<span id="xii.iii-p137"></span>Then they say the verse. <span
id="fr_4171"></span>[4172](#fn_4171.md) The Deacon says—The three. <span
id="fr_4172"></span>[4173](#fn_4172.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p140"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p141"></span>O Sovereign and Almighty God, the Father
of our Lord <span id="xii.iii-p141.1"></span>Jesus Christ, we pray and
beseech Thee to fill our hearts with the peace of heaven, and to bestow
moreover the peace of this life. Preserve for us through many years our
most holy and blessed <span id="xii.iii-p141.2"></span>Papas <span
id="xii.iii-p141.3"></span>Δ, <span id="fr_4173"></span>[4174](#fn_4173.md)
and our most pious Bishop <span id="xii.iii-p142.1"></span>Δ, while
they, according to Thy holy and blessed will, peacefully fulfil the holy
priesthood committed to their care, and dispense aright the word of
truth, with all the orthodox bishops, elders, deacons,
sub-deacons, <span id="fr_4174"></span>[4175](#fn_4174.md) readers,
singers, with the entire body of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.
Bless our meetings, O Lord. <span id="page_554">p. 554</span> <span
id="xii.iii-Page_554"></span>Grant that we may hold them without let or
hindrance, according to Thy holy will. Be pleased to give to us, and Thy
servants after us for ever, houses of praise and prayer. Rise, O Lord,
and let Thine enemies be scattered. Let all who hate Thy holy name be
put to flight. Bless Thy faithful and orthodox people. Multiply them by
thousands and tens of thousands. Let no deadly sin prevail against them,
or against Thy holy people, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine
only-begotten Son.  

<span id="xii.iii-p144"></span><span
id="xii.iii-p144.1"></span>(Aloud.<span id="xii.iii-p144.2"></span>)  

<span id="xii.iii-p145"></span>Through whom and with whom be glory and
power to Thee, with Thy all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p146"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p147"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p148"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p149"></span>Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p150"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p151"></span>And to thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p152"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p153"></span>Take care that none of the
catechumens <span id="fr_4175"></span>[4176](#fn_4175.md) —  

### <span id="xii.iii-p154.4"></span>II.

<span id="xii.iii-p155"></span>Then they sing the Cherubic hymn. <span
id="fr_4176"></span>[4177](#fn_4176.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p157"></span>X. The Priest offers incense at the
entrance, <span id="fr_4177"></span>[4178](#fn_4177.md) and prays:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p159"></span>O Lord our God, who lackest nothing,
accept this incense offered by an unworthy hand, and deem us all worthy
of Thy blessing, for Thou art our sanctification, and we ascribe glory
to Thee.  

<span id="xii.iii-p160"></span>The holy things are carried to the altar,
and the Priest prays thus:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p161"></span>O holy, highest, awe-inspiring God, who
dwellest among the saints, sanctify us, and deem us worthy of Thy
reverend priesthood. Bring us to Thy precious altar with a good
conscience, and cleanse our hearts from all pollution. Drive away from
us all unholy thoughts, and sanctify our souls and minds. Grant that,
with reverence of Thee, we may perform the service of our holy fathers,
and propitiate Thy presence through all time; for Thou art He who
blesseth and sanctifieth all things, and to Thee we ascribe glory and
thanks.  

<span id="xii.iii-p162"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p163"></span>XI. Salute one another.  

<span id="xii.iii-p164"></span>The Priest says the prayer of salutation.
 

<span id="xii.iii-p165"></span>O Sovereign and Almighty Lord, look down
from heaven on Thy Church, on all Thy people, and on all Thy flock. Save
us all, Thy unworthy servants, the sheep of Thy fold. Give us Thy peace,
Thy help, and Thy love, and send to us the gift of Thy Holy Spirit, that
with a pure heart and a good conscience we may salute one another with
an holy kiss, without hypocrisy, and with no hostile purpose, but
guileless and pure in one spirit, in the bond of peace and love, one
body and one spirit, in one faith, even as we have been called in one
hope of our calling, that we may all meet in the divine and boundless
love, in Christ <span id="xii.iii-p165.1"></span>Jesus our Lord, with
whom Thou art blessed.  

<span id="xii.iii-p166"></span>Then the Priest offers the incense, and
says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p167"></span>The incense is offered to Thy name. Let
it ascend, we implore Thee, from the hands of Thy poor and sinful
servants to Thy heavenly altar for a sweet-smelling savour, and the
propitiation of all Thy people. For all glory, honour, adoration, and
thanks are due unto Thee, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now,
henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p168"></span>After the Salutation, <span
id="fr_4178"></span>[4179](#fn_4178.md) the Deacon in a loud voice says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p170"></span>XII. Stand and make the offering
duly. <span id="fr_4179"></span>[4180](#fn_4179.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p172"></span><span class="Heading7Char"><span
id="xii.iii-p172.1"></span>The Priest</span><span
id="xii.iii-p172.2"></span>, making the sign of the cross over the disks
and chalices, says in a loud voice (the Nicene Creed):—  

<span id="xii.iii-p173"></span>I believe in one God, etc.  

<span id="xii.iii-p174"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p175"></span>Stand for prayer.  

<span id="xii.iii-p176"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p177"></span>Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p178"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p179"></span>Pray for those who present the offering.
 

<span id="xii.iii-p180"></span>The Priest says the prayer of the
Oblation. <span id="fr_4180"></span>[4181](#fn_4180.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p182"></span>O Sovereign Lord, Christ <span
id="xii.iii-p182.1"></span>Jesus the Word, who art equal in power with
the Father and the Holy Spirit, the great high priest; the bread that
came down from heaven, and saved our souls from ruin; who gavest
Thyself, a spotless Lamb, for the life of the world.…  

<span id="xii.iii-p183"></span>We pray and beseech Thee, O Lord, in Thy
mercy, to let Thy presence rest upon this bread and these chalices <span
id="fr_4181"></span>[4182](#fn_4181.md) on the all-holy table, while
angels, archangels, and Thy holy priests stand round and minister for
Thy glory and the renewing of our souls, through the grace, mercy, and
love of Thine only-begotten Son, through <span id="page_555">p.
555</span> <span id="xii.iii-Page_555"></span>whom and with whom be
glory and power to Thee.  

<span id="xii.iii-p185"></span>And when the People say,  

<span id="xii.iii-p186"></span>And from the Holy Spirit was He made
flesh;  

<span id="xii.iii-p187"></span>The Priest makes the sign of the
cross, <span id="fr_4182"></span>[4183](#fn_4182.md) and says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p189"></span>And was crucified for us.  

<span id="xii.iii-p190"></span>The Priest makes the sign of the cross
again, <span id="fr_4183"></span>[4184](#fn_4183.md) and says:—

<span id="xii.iii-p193"></span>XIII. <span
id="fr_4184"></span>[4185](#fn_4184.md) In like manner also, as after the
Creed, <span id="fr_4185"></span>[4186](#fn_4185.md) he makes the sign of
the cross upon the People, and says aloud:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p196"></span>The Lord be with all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p197"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p198"></span>And with thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p199"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p200"></span>Let us lift up our hearts.  

<span id="xii.iii-p201"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p202"></span>We lift them up to the Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p203"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p204"></span>Let us give thanks to the Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p205"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p206"></span>It is meet and right. <span
id="fr_4186"></span>[4187](#fn_4186.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p208"></span>The Priest begins the Anaphoral prayer.  

<span id="xii.iii-p209"></span>O Lord God, Sovereign and Almighty
Father, truly it is meet and right, holy and becoming, and good for our
souls, to praise, bless, and thank Thee; to make open confession to Thee
by day and night with voice, lips, and heart without ceasing;  

<span id="xii.iii-p210"></span>To Thee who hast made the heaven, and all
that is therein; the earth, and all that is therein; The sea, fountains,
rivers, lakes, and all that is therein;  

<span id="xii.iii-p211"></span>To Thee who, after Thine own image and
likeness, hast made man, upon whom Thou didst also bestow the joys of
Paradise;  

<span id="xii.iii-p212"></span>And when he trespassed against Thee, Thou
didst neither neglect nor forsake him, good Lord,  

<span id="xii.iii-p213"></span>But didst recall him by Thy law, instruct
him by Thy prophets, restore and renew him by this awful, life-giving,
and heavenly mystery.  

<span id="xii.iii-p214"></span>And all this Thou hast done by Thy Wisdom
and the Light of truth, Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord, God, and
Saviour <span id="xii.iii-p214.1"></span>Jesus Christ, Through whom,
thanking Thee with Him and the Holy Spirit,  

<span id="xii.iii-p215"></span>We offer this reasonable and bloodless
sacrifice, which all nations, from the rising to the setting of the sun,
from the north and the south, present to Thee, O Lord; for great is Thy
name among all peoples, and in all places are incense, sacrifice, and
oblation offered to Thy holy name. <span
id="fr_4187"></span>[4188](#fn_4187.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p217"></span>XIV. We pray and beseech Thee, <span
id="xii.iii-p217.1"></span>O lover of men, O good Lord, <span
id="fr_4188"></span>[4189](#fn_4188.md) remember in Thy good mercy the Holy
and only Catholic and Apostolic Church throughout the whole world, and
all Thy people, and all the sheep of this fold. <span
id="fr_4189"></span>[4190](#fn_4189.md) Vouchsafe to the hearts of all of
us the peace of heaven, but grant us also the peace of this life.  

<span id="xii.iii-p220"></span>Guide and direct in all peace the
king, <span id="fr_4190"></span>[4191](#fn_4190.md) army, magistrates,
councils, <span id="fr_4191"></span>[4192](#fn_4191.md) peoples, and
neighbourhoods, and all our outgoings and incomings.  

<span id="xii.iii-p223"></span>O King of Peace, grant us Thy peace in
unity and love. May we be Thine, O Lord; for we know no other God but
Thee, and name no other name but Thine. Give life unto the souls of all
of us, and let no deadly sin prevail against us, or against all Thy
people.  

<span id="xii.iii-p224"></span>Look down in mercy and compassion, O
Lord, and heal the sick among Thy people. Deliver them and us, O Lord,
from sickness and disease, and drive away the spirit of weakness.  

<span id="xii.iii-p225"></span>Raise up those who have been long
afflicted, and heal those who are vexed with unclean spirits.  

<span id="xii.iii-p226"></span>Have mercy on all who are in prison, or
in mines, or on trial, or condemned, or in exile, or crushed by cruel
bondage or tribute. Deliver them, O Lord, for Thou art our God, who
settest the captives free; who raisest up the downtrodden; who givest
hope to the hopeless, and help to the helpless; who liftest up the
fallen; who givest refuge to the shipwrecked, and vengeance to the
oppressed.  

<span id="xii.iii-p227"></span>Pity, relieve, and restore every
Christian soul that is afflicted or wandering.  

<span id="xii.iii-p228"></span>But do Thou, O Lord, the physician of our
souls and bodies, the guardian of all flesh, look down, and by Thy
saving power heal all the diseases of soul and body.  

<span id="xii.iii-p229"></span>Guide and prosper our brethren who have
gone or who are about to go abroad. Whether they travel by land, or
river, or lake, by public road, or in whatever way journeying, bring
them everywhere to a safe and tranquil haven. Be pleased to be with them
by land and sea, and restore them in health and joy to joyful and
healthful homes.<span id="page_556">p. 556</span> <span
id="xii.iii-Page_556"></span>  

<span id="xii.iii-p230"></span>Ever defend, O Lord, our journey through
this life from trouble and storm.  

<span id="xii.iii-p231"></span>Send down rich and copious showers on the
dry and thirsty lands.  

<span id="xii.iii-p232"></span>Gladden and revive the face of the earth,
that it may spring forth and rejoice in the raindrops.  

<span id="xii.iii-p233"></span>Make the waters of the river flow in full
stream.  

<span id="xii.iii-p234"></span>Gladden and revive the face of the earth
with the swelling waters.  

<span id="xii.iii-p235"></span>Fill all the channels of the streams, and
multiply the fruits of the earth.  

<span id="xii.iii-p236"></span>Bless, O Lord, the fruits of the earth,
and keep them safe and unharmed. Fill them with seed, and make them ripe
for the harvest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p237"></span>Bless even now, O Lord, Thy yearly crown
of blessing for the sake of the poor of Thy people, the widow, the
orphan, and the stranger, and for the sake of all of us who have our
hope in Thee and call upon Thy holy name; for the eyes of all are upon
Thee, and Thou givest them bread in due season.  

<span id="xii.iii-p238"></span>O Thou who givest food to all flesh, fill
our hearts with joy and gladness, that at all times, having all
sufficiency, we may abound to every good work in Christ <span
id="xii.iii-p238.1"></span>Jesus our Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p239"></span>O King of kings and Lord of lords, defend
the kingdom of Thy servant, our orthodox and Christ-loving
sovereign, <span id="fr_4192"></span>[4193](#fn_4192.md) whom Thou hast
deemed worthy to reign over this land in peace, courage, and justice.  

<span id="xii.iii-p241"></span>Subdue under him, O Lord, every enemy and
adversary, whether at home or abroad. Gird on Thy shield and armour, and
rise to his aid. Draw Thy sword, and help him to fight against them that
persecute him. Shield him in the day of battle, and grant that the fruit
of his loins may sit upon his throne.  

<span id="xii.iii-p242"></span>Be kind to him, O Lord, for the sake of
Thy Holy and Apostolic Church, and all Thy Christ-loving people, that we
too in his peaceful reign may live a calm and tranquil life, in all
reverence and godliness.  

<span id="xii.iii-p243"></span>O Lord our God, give peace to the souls
of our fathers and brethren who have fallen asleep in <span
id="xii.iii-p243.1"></span>Jesus, remembering our forefathers of old,
our fathers, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors,
bishops, and the souls of all the holy and just men who have died in the
Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p244"></span>Especially remember those whose memory we
this day <span id="xii.iii-p244.1"></span>celebrate, and our holy father
<span id="xii.iii-p244.2"></span>Mark, <span
id="fr_4193"></span>[4194](#fn_4193.md) the apostle and evangelist, who has
shown us the way of salvation. <span
id="fr_4194"></span>[4195](#fn_4194.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p250"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p251"></span>Lord, bless us.  

<span id="xii.iii-p252"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p253"></span>The Lord will bless thee in His grace,
now, henceforth, and for evermore.  

<span id="xii.iii-p254"></span>The Deacon reads the record of the
dead. <span id="fr_4195"></span>[4196](#fn_4195.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p256"></span>The Priest bows and prays.  

<span id="xii.iii-p257"></span>XV. Give peace, O Sovereign Lord our God,
to the souls of all who dwell in the tabernacles of Thy saints.
Graciously bestow upon them in Thy kingdom Thy promised blessing, which
eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, nor has it entered into the
heart of man what Thou, O God, hast prepared for those who love Thy holy
name. Give peace to their souls, and deem them worthy of the kingdom of
heaven. <span id="fr_4196"></span>[4197](#fn_4196.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p259"></span>Grant that we may end our lives as
Christians, acceptable unto Thee and without sin, and be pleased to give
us part and lot with all Thy saints.  

<span id="xii.iii-p260"></span>Accept, O God, by Thy ministering
archangels at Thy holy, heavenly, and reasonable altar in the spacious
heavens, the thank-offerings of those who offer sacrifice and oblation,
and of those who desire to offer much or little, in secret or openly,
but have it not to give.  

<span id="xii.iii-p261"></span>Accept the thank-offerings of those who
have presented them this day, as Thou didst accept the gifts of Thy
righteous <span id="xii.iii-p261.1"></span>Abel:  

<span id="xii.iii-p262"></span>The Priest offers incense, and
says: <span id="fr_4197"></span>[4198](#fn_4197.md) —  

<span id="xii.iii-p264"></span>As Thou didst accept the sacrifice of our
father <span id="xii.iii-p264.1"></span>Abraham, the incense of <span
id="xii.iii-p264.2"></span>Zacharias, the alms of <span
id="xii.iii-p264.3"></span>Cornelius, and the widow’s two mites, accept
also the thank-offerings of these, and give them for the things of time
the things of eternity, and for the things of earth the things of
heaven. Defend, O Lord, our most holy and blessed <span
id="xii.iii-p264.4"></span>Papas <span
id="fr_4198"></span>[4199](#fn_4198.md) <span id="xii.iii-p265.1"></span>Δ,
whom Thou hast fore-ordained to rule over Thy Holy Catholic and
Apostolic Church, and our most pious Bishop <span
id="xii.iii-p265.2"></span>Δ, that they through many years of peace may,
according to Thy holy and blessed will, fulfil the sacred priesthood
committed to their care, and dispense aright the word of truth.  

<span id="xii.iii-p266"></span>Remember the orthodox bishops everywhere,
the elders, deacons, sub-deacons, readers, singers, monks, <span
id="fr_4199"></span>[4200](#fn_4199.md) virgins, widows, and laity.  

<span id="xii.iii-p268"></span>Remember, O Lord, the holy city <span
id="fr_4200"></span>[4201](#fn_4200.md) of our God, <span
id="xii.iii-p269.1"></span>Jesus Christ; and the imperial city; <span
id="fr_4201"></span>[4202](#fn_4201.md) and this city of ours, and all
cities and all lands, and the peace and safety of those who dwell
therein in the orthodox faith of Christ. <span id="page_557">p.
557</span> <span id="xii.iii-Page_557"></span>  

<span id="xii.iii-p271"></span>Be mindful, O Lord, of the return of the
back-sliding, and of every Christian soul that is afflicted and
oppressed, and in need of Thy divine mercy and help.  

<span id="xii.iii-p272"></span>Be mindful, O Lord, of our brethren in
captivity. Grant that they may find mercy and compassion with those who
have led them captive.  

<span id="xii.iii-p273"></span>Be mindful also of us, O Lord, Thy sinful
and unworthy servants, and blot out our sins in Thy goodness and mercy.
 

<span id="xii.iii-p274"></span>Be mindful also of me, Thy lowly, sinful,
and unworthy servant, and in Thy mercy blot out my sins. Be with us, O
Lord, who minister unto Thy holy name.  

<span id="xii.iii-p275"></span>Bless our meetings, O Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p276"></span>Utterly uproot idolatry from the
world. <span id="fr_4202"></span>[4203](#fn_4202.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p278"></span>Crush under our feet Satan, and all his
wicked influence.  

<span id="xii.iii-p279"></span>Humble now, as at all times, the enemies
of Thy Church.  

<span id="xii.iii-p280"></span>Lay bare their pride.  

<span id="xii.iii-p281"></span>Speedily show them their weakness.  

<span id="xii.iii-p282"></span>Bring to naught the wicked plots they
contrive against us.  

<span id="xii.iii-p283"></span>Arise, O Lord, and let Thine enemies be
scattered, and let all who hate Thy holy name be put to flight.  

<span id="xii.iii-p284"></span>Do Thou bless a thousand times ten
thousand Thy faithful and orthodox people while they do Thy holy will.  

<span id="xii.iii-p285"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p286"></span>Let those who are seated stand.  

<span id="xii.iii-p287"></span>The Priest says the following prayer:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p288"></span>Deliver the captive; rescue the
distressed feed the hungry; comfort the faint-hearted, convert the
erring; enlighten the darkened; raise the fallen; confirm the wavering;
heal the sick; and guide them all, good Lord, into the way of salvation,
and into Thy sacred fold. Deliver us from our iniquities; protect and
defend us at all times.  

<span id="xii.iii-p289"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p290"></span>Turn to the east.  

<span id="xii.iii-p291"></span>The Priest bows and prays.  

<span id="xii.iii-p292"></span>For Thou art far above all principality,
and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not
only in this world, but in that which is to come. Round Thee stand ten
thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands of holy angels
and hosts of archangels; and Thy two most honoured creatures, the
many-eyed cherubim and the six-winged seraphim. With twain they cover
their faces, and with twain they cover their feet, and with twain they
do fly; and they cry one to another for ever with the voice of praise,
and glorify Thee, O Lord, singing aloud the triumphal and
thrice-holy <span id="fr_4203"></span>[4204](#fn_4203.md) hymn to Thy great
glory:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p294"></span>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.
Heaven and earth are full of Thy glory.  

<span id="xii.iii-p295"></span>(Aloud.)  

<span id="xii.iii-p296"></span>Thou dost ever sanctify all men; but with
all who glorify Thee, receive also, O Sovereign Lord, our
sanctification, who with them celebrate Thy praise, and say:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p297"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p298"></span>Holy, holy, holy Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p299"></span>The Priest makes the sign of the cross
over the sacred mysteries.  

<span id="xii.iii-p300"></span>XVI. For truly heaven and earth are full
of Thy glory, through the manifestation of our Lord and God and Saviour
<span id="xii.iii-p300.1"></span>Jesus Christ. Fill, O God, this
sacrifice with Thy blessing, through the inspiration of Thy all-holy
Spirit. For the Lord Himself, our God and universal King, Christ <span
id="xii.iii-p300.2"></span>Jesus, reclining at meat the same night on
which He delivered Himself up for our sins and died in the flesh for
all, took bread in His holy, pure, and immaculate hands, and lifting His
eyes to His Father, our God, and the God of all, gave thanks; and when
He had blessed, hallowed, and broken the bread, gave it to His holy and
blessed disciples and apostles, saying:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p301"></span>(Aloud.)  

<span id="xii.iii-p302"></span>Take, eat.  

<span id="xii.iii-p303"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p304"></span>Pray earnestly.  

<span id="xii.iii-p305"></span>The Priest (aloud).  

<span id="xii.iii-p306"></span>For this is my body, which is broken for
you, and divided for the remission of sins.  

<span id="xii.iii-p307"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p308"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p309"></span>The Priest prays.  

<span id="xii.iii-p310"></span>After the same manner also, when He had
supped, He took the cup of wine mingled with water, and lifting His eyes
to Thee, His Father, our God, and the God of all, gave thanks; and when
He had blessed and filled it with the Holy Spirit, gave it to His holy
and blessed disciples and apostles, saying:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p311"></span>(Aloud.)  

<span id="xii.iii-p312"></span>Drink ye all of it.  

<span id="xii.iii-p313"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p314"></span>Pray earnestly again. <span
id="page_558">p. 558</span> <span id="xii.iii-Page_558"></span>  

<span id="xii.iii-p315"></span>The Priest (aloud).  

<span id="xii.iii-p316"></span>For this is my blood of the new testament
which is shed for you and for many, and distributed among you for the
remission of sins.  

<span id="xii.iii-p317"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p318"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p319"></span>The Priest prays thus:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p320"></span>This do ye in remembrance of me; for as
often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show forth my death
and acknowledge my resurrection and ascension until I come. O Sovereign
and Almighty Lord, King of heaven, while we show forth <span
id="fr_4204"></span>[4205](#fn_4204.md) the death of Thine only-begotten
Son, our Lord, God, and Saviour <span id="xii.iii-p321.2"></span>Jesus
Christ, and acknowledge His blessed resurrection from the dead on the
third day, we do also openly declare His ascension into heaven, and His
sitting on the right hand of Thee, God and Father, and await His second
terrible and dreadful coming, in which He will come to judge righteously
the quick and the dead, and to render to each man according to his
works.  

<span id="xii.iii-p322"></span>XVII. O Lord our God, we have placed
before Thee what is Thine from Thine own mercies. We pray and beseech
Thee, O good and merciful God, to send down from Thy holy heaven, from
the mansion Thou hast prepared, and from Thine infinite bosom, the
Paraclete Himself, <span id="fr_4205"></span>[4206](#fn_4205.md) holy,
powerful, and life-giving, the Spirit of truth, who spoke in the law,
the apostles, and prophets; who is everywhere present, and filleth all
things, freely working sanctification in whom He will with Thy good
pleasure; one in His nature; manifold in His working; the fountain of
divine blessing; of like substance <span
id="fr_4206"></span>[4207](#fn_4206.md) with Thee, and proceeding from
Thee; sitting with Thee on the throne of Thy kingdom, and with Thine
only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour <span
id="xii.iii-p324.2"></span>Jesus Christ. Send down upon us also and upon
this bread and upon these chalices Thy Holy Spirit, that by His
all-powerful and divine influence He may sanctify and consecrate them,
and make this bread the body. <span id="fr_4207"></span>[4208](#fn_4207.md)
 

<span id="xii.iii-p326"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p327"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p328"></span>The Priest (aloud).  

<span id="xii.iii-p329"></span>And this cup the blood of the new
testament, of the very Lord, and God, and Saviour, and universal King
Christ <span id="xii.iii-p329.1"></span>Jesus.  

<span id="xii.iii-p330"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p331"></span>Deacons, come down.  

<span id="xii.iii-p332"></span>The Priest (aloud).  

<span id="xii.iii-p333"></span> That to all of us who partake thereof
they may tend unto faith, sobriety, healing, temperance, sanctification,
the renewal of soul, body, and spirit, participation in the blessedness
of eternal life and immortality, the glory of Thy most holy name, and
the remission of sins, that Thy most holy, precious, and glorious name
may be praised and glorified in this as in all things.  

<span id="xii.iii-p334"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p335"></span>As it was and is.  

<span id="xii.iii-p336"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p337"></span>XVIII. Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p338"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p339"></span>Pray.  

<span id="xii.iii-p340"></span>The Priest prays in secret.  

<span id="xii.iii-p341"></span>O God of light, Father of life, Author of
grace, Creator of worlds, Founder of knowledge, Giver of wisdom,
Treasure of holiness, Teacher of pure prayers, Benefactor of our souls,
who givest to the faint-hearted who put their trust in Thee those things
into which the angels desire to look: O Sovereign Lord, who hast brought
us up from the depths of darkness to light, who hast given us life from
death, who hast graciously bestowed upon us freedom from slavery, who
hast scattered the darkness of sin within us, through the presence of
Thine only-begotten Son, do Thou now also, through the visitation of Thy
all-holy Spirit, enlighten the eyes of our understanding, that we may
partake without fear of condemnation of this heavenly and immortal food,
and sanctify us wholly in soul, body, and spirit, that with Thy holy
disciples and apostles we may say this prayer to Thee: Our Father who
art in heaven, etc.  

<span id="xii.iii-p342"></span>(Aloud.)  

<span id="xii.iii-p343"></span>And grant, O Sovereign Lord, in Thy
mercy, that we with freedom of speech, without fear of condemnation,
with pure heart and enlightened soul, with face that is not ashamed, and
with hollowed lips, may venture to call upon Thee, the holy God who art
in heaven, as our Father, and say:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p344"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p345"></span>Our Father who art in heaven, etc.  

<span id="xii.iii-p346"></span>The Priest prays: <span
id="fr_4208"></span>[4209](#fn_4208.md) —  

<span id="xii.iii-p348"></span>Verily, Lord, Lord, lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil; for Thy abundant mercy showeth
that we through our great infirmity are unable to resist it. Grant that
we may find a way whereby we may be able to withstand temptation; for
Thou hast given us power to tread upon serpents, and scorpions, and all
the power of the enemy. <span id="page_559">p. 559</span> <span
id="xii.iii-Page_559"></span>  

<span id="xii.iii-p349"></span>(Aloud.)  

<span id="xii.iii-p350"></span>For Thine is the kingdom and power.  

<span id="xii.iii-p351"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p352"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p353"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p354"></span>XIX. Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p355"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p356"></span>Bow your heads to <span
id="xii.iii-p356.1"></span>Jesus. <span
id="fr_4209"></span>[4210](#fn_4209.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p358"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p359"></span>Thou, Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p360"></span>The Priest prays.  

<span id="xii.iii-p361"></span>O Sovereign and Almighty Lord, <span
id="fr_4210"></span>[4211](#fn_4210.md) who sittest upon the cherubim, and
art glorified by the seraphim; who hast made the heaven out of waters,
and adorned it with choirs of stars; who hast placed an unbodied host of
angels in the highest heavens to sing Thy praise for ever; before Thee
have we bowed our souls and bodies in token of our bondage. We beseech
Thee to repel the dark assaults of sin from our understanding, and to
gladden our minds with the divine radiance of Thy Holy Spirit, that,
filled with the knowledge of Thee, we may worthily partake of the
mercies set before us, the pure body and precious blood of Thine
only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour <span
id="xii.iii-p362.1"></span>Jesus Christ. Pardon all our sins in Thy
abundant and unsearchable goodness, through the grace, mercy, and love
of Thine only-begotten Son: <span id="fr_4211"></span>[4212](#fn_4211.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p364"></span>(Aloud.)

<span id="xii.iii-p371"></span>O holy, highest, awe-inspiring God, who
dwellest among the saints, sanctify us by the word of Thy grace and by
the inspiration of Thy all-holy Spirit; for Thou hast said, O Lord our

consubstantial <span id="fr_4212"></span>[4213](#fn_4212.md) and co-eternal

<span id="xii.iii-p381"></span>The Deacon.

<span id="xii.iii-p383"></span>The Priest makes the sign of the cross

<span id="xii.iii-p384"></span>The Lord be with all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p385"></span>The Priest breaks the bread, and saith:—
 

<span id="xii.iii-p386"></span>Praise ye God.  

<span id="xii.iii-p387"></span>The Priest divides it among those
present, and saith:—

<span id="xii.iii-p400"></span>The Clergy.  

<span id="xii.iii-p401"></span>And with thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p402"></span>The Priest says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p403"></span>The Lord Himself hath blessed it.  

<span id="xii.iii-p404"></span>The Priest partakes, and prays.

<span id="xii.iii-p414"></span>After the service is completed, the
Deacon says:—

id="fr_4218"></span>[4219](#fn_4218.md)  

<span id="xii.iii-p417"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p418"></span>Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p419"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p420"></span>Pray.  

<span id="xii.iii-p421"></span>The Priest says the prayer of
thanksgiving.  

<span id="xii.iii-p422"></span>O Sovereign Lord our God, we thank Thee
that we have partaken of Thy holy, pure, immortal, and heavenly
mysteries, which Thou hast given for our good, and for the
sanctification and salvation of our souls and bodies. We pray and
beseech Thee, O Lord, to grant in Thy good mercy, that by partaking of
the holy body and precious blood of Thine only-begotten Son, we may have
faith that is not ashamed, love that is unfeigned, fulness of holiness,
power to eschew evil and keep Thy commandments, provision for eternal
life, and an acceptable defence before the awful tribunal of Thy Christ:
 

<span id="xii.iii-p423"></span>In a loud voice.  

<span id="xii.iii-p424"></span>Through whom and with whom be glory and
power to Thee, with Thy all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p425"></span>The Priest then turns to the people, and
says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p426"></span>XXII. O mightiest King, co-eternal with
the Father, who by Thy might hast vanquished hell and trodden death
under foot, who hast bound the strong man, and by Thy miraculous power
and the enlightening radiance of Thy unspeakable Godhead hast raised
<span id="xii.iii-p426.1"></span>Adam from the tomb, send forth Thy
invisible right hand, which is full of blessing, and bless us all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p427"></span>Pity us, O Lord, and strengthen us by Thy
divine power.  

<span id="xii.iii-p428"></span>Take away from us the sinful and wicked
influence of carnal desire.  

<span id="xii.iii-p429"></span>Let the light shine into our souls, and
dispel the surrounding darkness of sin.  

<span id="xii.iii-p430"></span>Unite us to the all-blessed assembly that
is well-pleasing unto Thee; for through Thee and with Thee, all praise,
honour, power, adoration, and thanksgiving are due unto the Father and
the Holy Spirit, now, henceforth, and for evermore.  

<span id="xii.iii-p431"></span>The Deacon.  

<span id="xii.iii-p432"></span>Depart in peace:  

<span id="xii.iii-p433"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p434"></span>In the name of the Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p435"></span>The Priest (aloud).  

<span id="xii.iii-p436"></span>XXIII. The love of God the Father; the
grace of the Son, our Lord <span id="xii.iii-p436.1"></span>Jesus
Christ; the communion and gift of the All-holy Spirit, be with us all,
now, henceforth, and for evermore.  

<span id="xii.iii-p437"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p438"></span>Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.  

<span id="xii.iii-p439"></span>The Priest prays in the sacristy, and
says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p440"></span>O Lord, Thou hast given us sanctification
by partaking of the all-holy body and precious blood of Thine
only-begotten Son; give us the grace and gift of the All-holy Spirit.
Enable us to lead blameless lives; and guide us unto the perfect
redemption, and adoption, and the everlasting joys of the world to come.
For Thou art our sanctification, and we ascribe glory unto Thee, the
Father, and the Son, and the All-holy Spirit, now, henceforth, and for
evermore.  

<span id="xii.iii-p441"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p442"></span>Amen.  

<span id="xii.iii-p443"></span>The Priest.  

<span id="xii.iii-p444"></span>Peace be to all.  

<span id="xii.iii-p445"></span>The People.  

<span id="xii.iii-p446"></span>And to thy spirit.  

<span id="xii.iii-p447"></span>The Priest dismisses them, and says:—  

<span id="xii.iii-p448"></span>May God bless, who blesseth and
sanctifieth, who defendeth and preserveth us all through the partaking
of His holy mysteries; and who is blessed for ever. Amen.
