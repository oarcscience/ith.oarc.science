<p> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p0.1"></A>Chap. XXIV.&#8212;Of the Origin of Sacred Rites and Superstitions.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1"></A>These are the mysteries of the gods. Now let us inquire also into the origin of superstitions, that we may search out by whom and at what times they were instituted. <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.1"></A>Didymus, in those books which are inscribed <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.2"></A>Of the Explanation of Pindar,<A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-Page_230"></A> relates that <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.3"></A>Melisseus was king of the Cretans, whose daughters were <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.4"></A>Amalthea and <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.5"></A>Melissa, who nourished <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.6"></A>Jupiter with goats&#146; milk and honey; that he introduced new rites and ceremonies of sacred things, and was the first who sacrificed to gods, that is, to <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.7"></A>Vesta, who is called <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.8"></A>Tellus,&#8212;whence the poet says:&#8212; &#160;</p>  <blockquote><a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.9"></A>   &#8220;And the first of the gods,<br>    <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p1.12"></A>Tellus,&#8221;&#8212;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="Continue"><a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2"></A>and afterwards to the mother of the gods. But <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.1"></A>Euhemerus, in his sacred history, says that <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.2"></A>Jupiter himself, after that he received the government, erected temples in honour of himself in many places. For in going about the world, as he came to each place he united the chiefs of the people to himself in friendship and the right of hospitality; and that the remembrance of this might be preserved, he ordered that temples should be built to him, and annual festivals be celebrated by those connected with him in a league of hospitality. Thus he spread the worship of himself through all lands. But at what time they lived can easily be inferred. For <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.3"></A>Thallus writes in his history, that <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.4"></A>Belus, the king of the Assyrians, whom the Babylonians worship, and who was the contemporary and friend of <a name="iii.ii.viii.xx-p2.5"></A>Saturnus, was three hundred and twenty-two years before the Trojan war, and it is fourteen hundred and seventy years since the taking of Troy. From which it is evident, that it is not more than eighteen hundred years from the time when mankind fell into error by the institution of new forms of divine worship. &#160;</p>
