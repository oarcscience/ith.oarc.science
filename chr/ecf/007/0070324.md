#### <span id="iii.v.xv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XV.

<span id="iii.v.xv-p1"></span>And now <span
id="iii.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Diocletian raged, not only against his own
domestics, but indiscriminately against all; and he began by forcing his
daughter <span id="iii.v.xv-p1.2"></span>Valeria and his wife <span
id="iii.v.xv-p1.3"></span>Prisca to be polluted by sacrificing. <span
id="iii.v.xv-p1.4"></span>Eunuchs, once the most powerful, and who had
chief authority at court and with the emperor, were slain. Presbyters
and other officers of the Church were seized, without evidence by
witnesses or confession, condemned, and together with their families led
to execution. In burning alive, no distinction of sex or age was
regarded; and because of their great multitude, they were not burnt one
after another, but a herd of them were encircled with the same fire; and
servants, having millstones tied about their necks, were cast into the
sea. Nor was the persecution less grievous on the rest of the people of
God; for the judges, dispersed through all the temples, sought to compel
every one to sacrifice. The prisons were crowded; tortures, hitherto
unheard of, were invented; and lest justice should be inadvertently
administered to a Christian, altars were placed in the courts of
justice, hard by the tribunal, that every litigant might offer incense
before his cause could be heard. Thus judges were no otherwise
approached than divinities. <span id="iii.v.xv-p1.5"></span>Mandates
also had gone to <span id="iii.v.xv-p1.6"></span>Maximian Herculius and
<span id="iii.v.xv-p1.7"></span>Constantius, requiring their concurrence
in the execution of the edicts; for in matters even of such mighty
importance their opinion was never once asked. <span
id="iii.v.xv-p1.8"></span>Herculius, a person of no merciful temper,
yielded ready obedience, and enforced the edicts throughout his
dominions of Italy. <span id="iii.v.xv-p1.9"></span>Constantius, on the
other hand, lest he should have seemed to dissent from the injunctions
of his superiors, permitted the demolition of churches,—mere walls, and
capable of being built up again,—but he preserved entire that true
temple of God, which is the human body. <span

<span id="iii.v.xv-p2"></span> \[Truly an eloquent passage, and a
tribute to <span id="iii.v.xv-p2.1"></span>Constantius, which <span
id="iii.v.xv-p2.2"></span>Constantine, in filial humour, must have
relished.\]
