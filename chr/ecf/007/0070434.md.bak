<span id="ix.iii.ii"></span>

#### <span id="ix.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Sec. II.—On the Character and Teaching of the Bishop.

<span id="ix.iii.ii-p1"></span>On which account let him also be void of
anger; for Wisdom says: “Anger destroys even the prudent.” <span
id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md) Let him also be merciful, of a
generous and loving temper; for our Lord says: “By this shall all men
know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another.” <span
id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md) Let him be also ready to give, a
lover of the widow and the stranger; ready to serve, and minister, and
attend; resolute in his duty; and let him know who is the most worthy of
his assistance.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.ii-p3.2"></span>That Charitable Distributions are Not to Be Made to Every Widow, But that Sometimes a Woman Who Has a Husband is to Be Preferred: and that No Distributions are to Be Made to Any One Who is Given to Gluttony, Drunkenness, and Idleness.

<span id="ix.iii.ii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.ii-p4.1"></span>IV</span>. For if there be a widow who is
able to support herself, and another woman who is not a widow, but is
needy by reason of sickness, or the bringing up many children, or
infirmity of her hands, let him stretch out his hand in charity rather
to this latter. But if any one be in want by gluttony, drunkenness, or
idleness, he does not deserve any assistance, or <span
id="ix.iii.ii-p4.2"></span>to be esteemed a member of the Church of God.
For the Scripture, speaking of such persons, says: “The slothful hideth
his hand in his bosom, and is not able to bring it to his mouth
again.” <span id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md) And again: “The
sluggard folds up his hands, and eats his own flesh.” <span
id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md) “For every drunkard and whoremonger
shall come to poverty, and every drowsy person shall be clothed with
tatters <span id="ix.iii.ii-p6.2"></span>and rags.” <span
id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) And in another passage: “If thou
give thine eyes to drinking and cups, thou shalt afterwards walk more
naked than a pestle.” <span id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md) For
certainly idleness is the mother of famine.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.ii-p8.2"></span>That a Bishop Must Be No Accepter of Persons in Judgment; That He Must Possess a Gentle Disposition, and Be Temperate in His Mode of Life.

<span id="ix.iii.ii-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>V</span>. A bishop must be no accepter of
persons; neither revering nor flattering a rich man contrary to what is
right, nor overlooking nor domineering over a poor man. For, says God to
<span id="ix.iii.ii-p9.2"></span>Moses, “Thou shalt not accept the
person of the rich, nor shalt thou pity a poor man in his cause: for the
judgment is the Lord’s.” <span id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604.md) And
again: “Thou shalt with exact justice follow that which is right.” <span
id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605.md) Let a bishop be frugal, and
contented with a little in his meat and drink, that he may be ever in a
sober frame, and disposed to instruct and admonish the ignorant; and let
him not be costly in his diet, a pamperer of himself, given to pleasure,
or fond of delicacies. Let him he patient and gentle in his admonitions,
well instructed himself, meditating in and diligently studying the
Lord’s books, and reading them frequently, that so he may be able
carefully to interpret the Scriptures, expounding the Gospel in
correspondence with the prophets and with the law; and let the
expositions from the law and the prophets correspond to the Gospel. For
the Lord <span id="ix.iii.ii-p11.2"></span>Jesus says: “Search the
Scriptures; for they are those which testify of me.” <span
id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606.md) And again: “For <span
id="ix.iii.ii-p12.2"></span>Moses wrote of me.” <span
id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607.md) But, above all, let him carefully
distinguish between the original law and the additional precepts, and
show which are the laws for believers, and which the bonds for the
unbelievers, lest any should fall under those bonds. Be careful,
therefore, O bishop, to study the word, that thou mayest be able to
explain everything exactly, and that thou mayest copiously nourish thy
people with much doctrine, and enlighten them with the light of the law;
for God says: “Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge, while
we have yet opportunity.” <span id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608.md)  

#### <span id="ix.iii.ii-p14.2"></span>That a Bishop Must Not Be Given to Filthy Lucre, Nor Be a Surety Nor an Advocate.

<span id="ix.iii.ii-p15"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.ii-p15.1"></span>VI</span>. Let not a bishop be given to
filthy lucre, especially before the Gentiles, rather suffering than
offering injuries; not covetous, nor rapacious; no purloiner; no admirer
of the rich, nor hater of the poor; no evil-speaker, nor false witness;
not given to anger; no brawler; not entangled with the affairs of this
life; not a surety for any one, nor an accuser in suits about money; not
ambitious; not double-minded, nor double-tongued; not ready to hearken
to calumny or evil-speaking; not a dissembler; not addicted to the
heathen festivals; not given to vain <span id="page_398">p. 398</span>
<span id="ix.iii.ii-Page_398"></span>deceits; not eager after worldly
things, nor a lover of money. For all these things are opposite to God,
and pleasing to demons. Let the bishop earnestly give all these precepts
in charge to the laity also, persuading them to imitate his conduct.
For, says He, “Do ye make the children of Israel pious.” <span
id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609.md) Let him be prudent, humble, apt to
admonish with the instructions of the Lord, well-disposed, one who has
renounced all the wicked projects of this world, and all heathenish
lusts; let hint be orderly, sharp in observing the wicked, and taking
heed of them, but yet a friend to all; just, discerning; and whatsoever
qualities are commendable among men, let the bishop possess them in
himself. For if the pastor be unblameable as to any wickedness, he will
compel his own disciples, and by his very mode of life press them to
become worthy imitators of his own actions. As the prophet somewhere
says, “And it will be, as is the priest, so is the people;” <span
id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610.md) for our Lord and Teacher <span
id="ix.iii.ii-p17.2"></span>Jesus Christ, <span
id="ix.iii.ii-p17.3"></span>the Son <span
id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611.md) of God, began first to do, and then
to teach, <span id="ix.iii.ii-p18.2"></span>as Luke somewhere<span
id="ix.iii.ii-p18.3"></span> says: <span
id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612.md) “<span
id="ix.iii.ii-p19.2"></span>which Jesus began<span
id="ix.iii.ii-p19.3"></span> to do and to teach.” <span
id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md) Wherefore he says: “Whosoever shall
do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) For you bishops are to be guides
and watchmen to the people, as you yourselves have Christ for your guide
and watchman. Do you therefore become good guides and watchmen to the
people of God. For the Lord says by Ezekiel, speaking to every one of
you: “Son of man, I have given thee for a watchman to the house of
Israel; and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and shalt observe,
and shalt declare it from me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt
surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his
wickedness, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, and his blood
will I require at thine hand. But if thou warn the wicked from his way,
that he may turn from it, and he does not turn from it, he shall die in
his iniquity, and thou hast delivered thy soul.” <span
id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615.md) “In the same manner, if the sword
of war be approaching, and the people set a watchman to watch, and he
see the same approach, and does not forewarn them, and the sword come
and take one of them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood
shall be required at the watchman’s hand, because he did not blow the
trumpet. But if he blew the trumpet, and he who heard it would not take
warning, and the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon
him, because he heard the trumpet and took not warning. But he who took
warning has delivered his soul; and the watchman, because he gave
warning, shall surely live.” <span id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616.md)
The sword here is the judgment; the trumpet is the holy Gospel; the
watchman is the bishop, who is set in the Church, who is obliged by his
preaching to testify <span id="ix.iii.ii-p23.2"></span>and vehemently to
forewarn <span id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617.md) concerning that
judgment. If ye do not declare and testify this to the people, the sins
of those who are ignorant of it will be found upon you. Wherefore do you
warn and reprove the uninstructed with boldness, teach the ignorant,
confirm those that understand, bring back those that go astray. If we
repeat the very same things on the same occasions, brethren, we shall
not do amiss. For by frequent hearing it is to be hoped that some will
be made ashamed, and at least do some good action, and avoid some wicked
one. For says God by the prophet: “Testify those things to them; perhaps
they will hear thy voice.” <span id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618.md)
And again: “If perhaps they will hear, if perhaps they will
submit.” <span id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619.md) <span
id="ix.iii.ii-p26.2"></span>Moses also says to the people: “<span
id="ix.iii.ii-p26.3"></span>If hearing thou wilt hear the Lord God, and
do that which is good and right in His eyes.” <span
id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) <span
id="ix.iii.ii-p27.2"></span>And again: <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md) “Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God
is one Lord.” <span id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) And our Lord is
often recorded in the Gospel to have said: “He that hath ears to hear,
let him hear.” <span id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) And wise <span
id="ix.iii.ii-p30.2"></span>Solomon says: “My son, hear the instruction
of thy father, and reject not the laws of thy mother.” <span
id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624.md) And, indeed, to this day men have
not heard; for while they seem to have heard, they have not heard
aright, as appears by their having left the one and only true God, and
their being drawn into destructive and dangerous heresies, concerning
which we shall speak again afterwards.
