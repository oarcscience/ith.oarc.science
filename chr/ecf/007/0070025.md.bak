#### <span id="iii.ii.i.xx-p0.1"></span>Chap. xix.—that it is impossible for any one to worship the true god together with false deities.

<span id="iii.ii.i.xx-p1"></span>But some one will say that this supreme
Being, who made all things, and those also who conferred on men
particular benefits, are entitled to their respective worship. First of
all, it has never happened that the worshipper of these has also been a
worshipper of God. Nor can this possibly happen. For if the honour paid
to Him is shared by others, He altogether ceases to be worshipped, since
His religion requires us to believe that He is the one and only God. The
excellent poet exclaims, that all those who refined life by the
invention of arts are in the lower regions, and that even the discoverer
himself of such a medicine and art was thrust down by lightning to the
Stygian waves, that we may understand how great is the power of the
Almighty Father, who can extinguish even gods by His lightnings. But
ingenious men perchance thus reasoned with themselves: Because God
cannot be struck with lightning, it is manifest that the occurrence
never took place; nay, rather, because it did take place, it is manifest
that the person in question was a man, and not a god. For the falsehood
of the poets does not consist in the deed, but in the name. For they
feared evil, if, in opposition to the general persuasion, they should
acknowledge that which was true. But if this is agreed upon among
themselves, that gods were made from men, why then do they not believe
the poets, if at any time they describe their banishments and wounds,
their deaths, and wars, and adulteries? From which things it may be
understood that they could not possibly become gods, since they were not
even good men, and during their life they performed those actions which
bring forth everlasting death.
