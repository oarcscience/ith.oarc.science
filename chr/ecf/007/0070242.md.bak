#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.l-p0.1"></span>Chap. LIV.—Of the Freedom of Religion in the Worship of God.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.l-p1"></span>These things may indeed be said with
justice. But who will hear, when men of furious and unbridled spirit
think that their authority is diminished if there is any freedom in the
affairs of men? But it is religion alone in which freedom has placed its
dwelling. For it is a matter which is voluntary above all others, nor
can necessity be imposed upon any, so as to worship that which he does
not wish to worship. <span id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) Some one
may perhaps pretend, he cannot wish it. In short, some, through fear of
torments, or overcome by tortures, have assented to detestable
sacrifices: they never do that voluntarily which they did from
necessity; but when the opportunity is again given to them, and liberty
restored, they again betake themselves to God, and appease Him with
prayers and tears, repenting not of the will, which they had not, but of
the necessity which they endured; and pardon is not denied to those who
make satisfaction. What then does he accomplish who pollutes the body,
since he cannot change the will?  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.l-p3"></span>But, in fact, men of weak
understanding, if they have induced any man of spirit <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) to sacrifice to their gods, with
incredible alacrity insolently exult, and rejoice, as though they had
sent an enemy under the yoke. But if any one, neither frightened by
threats nor by tortures, shall have chosen to prefer his faith to his
life, cruelty puts forth all its ingenuity against him, plans dreadful
and intolerable things; and because they know that death for the cause
of God is glorious, and that this is a victory on our side, if, having
overcome the torturers, we lay down our life in behalf of the faith and
religion, they also themselves strive to conquer us. They do not put us
to death, but they search out new and unheard-of tortures, that the
frailty of the flesh may yield to pains, and if it does not yield, they
put off further punishment, and apply diligent care to the wounds, that
while the scars are yet fresh, a repetition of the torture may inflict
more pain; and while they practice this torture <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) upon the innocent, they evidently
consider themselves pious, and just, and religious (for they are
delighted with such sacrifices to their gods), but they term the others
impious and desperate. What perversity is this, that he who is punished,
though innocent, should be called desperate and impious, and that the
torturer, on the other hand, should be called just and pious!
