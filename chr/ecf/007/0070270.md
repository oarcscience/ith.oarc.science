#### <span id="iii.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VII.—Of Man, and the Brute Animals, and Religion.

<span id="iii.iii.vii-p1"></span>Though philosophers have often turned
aside from reason through their ignorance of the truth, and have fallen
into inextricable errors (for that is wont to happen to these which
happens to a traveller ignorant of the way, and not confessing that he
is ignorant ,—namely, that he wanders about, while he is ashamed to
inquire from those <span id="page_263">p. 263</span> <span
id="iii.iii.vii-Page_263"></span>whom he meets), no philosopher,
however, has ever made the assertion that there is no difference between
man and the brutes. Nor has any one at all, provided that he wished to
appear wise, reduced a rational animal to the level of the mute and
irrational; which some ignorant persons do, resembling the brutes
themselves, who, wishing to give themselves up to the indulgence of
their appetite and pleasure, say that they are born on the same
principle as all living animals, which it is impious for man to say. For
who is so unlearned as not to know, who is so void of understanding as
not to perceive, that there is something divine in man? I do not as yet
come to the excellences of the soul and of the intellect, by which there
is a manifest affinity between man and God. Does not the position of the
body itself, and the fashion of the countenance, declare that we are not
on a level with the dumb creation? Their nature is prostrated to the
ground and to their pasture, and has nothing in common with the heaven,
which they do not look upon. But man, with his erect position, with his
elevated countenance raised to the contemplation of the universe,
compares his features with God, and reason recognises reason. <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652)  

<span id="iii.iii.vii-p3"></span>And on this account there is no animal,
as <span id="iii.iii.vii-p3.1"></span>Cicero says, <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653) except man, which has any knowledge
of God. For he alone is furnished with wisdom, so that he alone
understands religion; and this is the chief or only difference between
man and the dumb animals. For the other things which appear to be
peculiar to man, even if there are not such in the dumb animals,
nevertheless may appear to be similar. Speech is peculiar to man; yet
even in these there is a certain resemblance to speech. For they both
distinguish one another by their voices; and when they are angry, they
send forth a sound resembling altercation; and when they see one another
after an interval of time, they show the office of congratulation by
their voice. To us, indeed, their voices appear uncouth, <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654) as ours perhaps do to them; but to
themselves, who understand one another, they are words. In short, in
every affection they utter distinct expressions of voice <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655) by which they may show their state
of mind. Laughter also is peculiar to man; and yet we see certain
indications of joy in other animals, when they use passionate
gestures <span id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656) with a view to
sports, hang down <span id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657) their ears,
contract their mouth, smooth their forehead, relax their eyes to
sportiveness. What is so peculiar to man as reason and the foreseeing of
the future? But there are animals which open several outlets in
different directions from their lairs, that if any danger comes upon
them, an escape may be open for them shut in; but they would not do this
unless they possessed intelligence and reflection. Others are provident
for the future, as  

> <span id="iii.iii.vii-p8.2"></span> “Ants, when they plunder a great
> heap of corn, mindful of the winter, and lay it up in their
> dwelling;” <span id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658)  

<span id="iii.iii.vii-p10"></span>again,—  

> <span id="iii.iii.vii-p10.1"></span> “As bees, which alone know a
> country and fixed abodes; and mindful of the winter which is to come,
> they practice labour in the summer, and lay up their gains as a common
> stock.” <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659)  

<span id="iii.iii.vii-p12"></span>It would be a long task if I should
wish to trace out the things most resembling the skill of man, which are
accustomed to be done by the separate tribes of animals. But if, in the
case of all these things which are wont to be ascribed to man, there is
found to be some resemblance even in the dumb animals, it is evident
that religion is the only thing of which no trace can be found in the
dumb animals, nor any indication. For justice is peculiar to religion,
and to this no other animal attains. For man alone bears rule; the other
animals are subjected <span id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660) to him.
But the worship of God is ascribed to justice; and he who does not
embrace this, being far removed from the nature of man, will live the
life of the brutes under the form of man. But since we differ from the
other animals almost in this respect alone, that we alone of all
perceive the divine might and power, while in the others there is no
understanding of God, it is surely impossible that in this respect
either the dumb animals should have more wisdom, or human nature should
be unwise, since all living creatures, and the whole system of nature,
are subject to man on account of his wisdom. Wherefore if reason, if the
force of man in this respect, excels and surpasses the rest of living
creatures, inasmuch as he alone is capable of the knowledge of God, it
is evident that religion can in no way be overthrown.
