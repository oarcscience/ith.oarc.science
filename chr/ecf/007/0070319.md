#### <span id="iii.v.x-p0.1"></span>Chap. X.

<span id="iii.v.x-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.x-p1.1"></span>Diocletian,
as being of a timorous disposition, was a searcher into futurity, and
during his abode in the East he began to slay victims, that from their
livers he might obtain a prognostic of events; and while he sacrificed,
some attendants of his, who were Christians, stood by, and they put the
<span id="iii.v.x-p1.2"></span>immortal sign on their foreheads. At this
the demons were chased away, and the holy rites interrupted. The
soothsayers trembled, unable to investigate the wonted marks on the
entrails of the victims. They frequently repeated the sacrifices, as if
the former had been unpropitious; but the victims, slain from time to
time, afforded no tokens for divination. At length <span
id="iii.v.x-p1.3"></span>Tages, the chief of the soothsayers, <span
id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md) either from guess or from his own
observation, said, “There are profane persons here, who obstruct the
rites.” Then <span id="iii.v.x-p2.1"></span>Diocletian, in furious
passion, ordered not only all who were assisting at the holy ceremonies,
but also <span id="page_305">p. 305</span> <span
id="iii.v.x-Page_305"></span>all who resided within the palace, to
sacrifice, and, in case of their refusal, to be scourged. And further,
by letters to the commanding officers, he enjoined that all soldiers
should be forced to the like impiety, under pain of being dismissed the
service. Thus far his rage proceeded; but at that season he did nothing
more against the law and religion of God. After an interval of some time
he went to winter in Bithynia; and presently <span
id="iii.v.x-p2.2"></span>Galerius Cæsar came thither, inflamed with
furious resentment, and purposing to excite the inconsiderate old man to
carry on that persecution which he had begun against the Christians. I
have learned that the cause of his fury was as follows.

such a difficulty, in order to incite the emperor to severities. They
may have found it convenient to represent the sign of the cross as the
source of their inability to give oracles.\]
