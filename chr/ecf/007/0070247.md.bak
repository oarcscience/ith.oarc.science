#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.lv-p0.1"></span>Chap. LIX.—Of the Ways of Life, and the First Times of the World.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.lv-p1"></span>That there are two ways <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) of human life was unknown neither
to philosophers nor to poets, but both introduced them in a different
manner. The philosophers wished the one to be the way of industry, the
other of idleness; but in this respect they were less correct in their
statements, that they referred them to the advantages of this life only.
The poets spoke better who said that one of them was the way of the
just, the other <span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lv-Page_247"></span>of the unjust; but they err in this,
that they say that they are not in this life, but in the shades below.
We manifestly speak more correctly, who say that the one is the way of
life, the other that of death. And here, however, we say that there are
two ways; but the one on the right hand, in which the just walk, does
not lead to Elysium, but to heaven, for they become immortal; the other
on the left leads to Tartarus, <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) for the unjust are sentenced to
eternal tortures. Therefore the way of justice, which leads to life, is
to be held by us. Now the first duty of justice is to acknowledge God as
a parent, and to fear Him as a master, to love Him as a father. For the
same Being who begat us, who animated us with vital breath, who
nourishes and preserves us, has over us, not only as a father but also
as a master, authority to correct us, and the power of life and death;
wherefore twofold honour is due to Him from man, that is, love combined
with fear. The second duty of justice is to acknowledge man as a
brother. For if the same God made us, and produced all men on equal
terms to justice and eternal life, it is manifest that we are united by
the relationship of brotherhood; and he who does not acknowledge this is
unjust. But the origin of this evil, by which the mutual society of men,
by which the bond of relationship has been torn asunder, arises from
ignorance of the true God. For he who is ignorant of that fountain of
bounty can by no means be good. Hence it is that, from the time when a
multitude of gods began to be consecrated and worshipped by men,
justice, as the poets relate, being put to flight, every compact was
destroyed, the fellowship of human justice was destroyed. Then every
one, consulting his own interest, reckoned might to be right, injured
another, attacked by frauds, deceived <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) by treachery, increased his own
advantages by the inconvenience of others, did not spare relatives, or
children, or parents, prepared poisoned cups for the destruction of men,
beset the ways with the sword, infested the seas, gave the rein to his
lust, wherever passion led him,—in short, esteemed nothing sacred which
his dreadful desire did not violate. When these things were done, then
men instituted laws for themselves to promote the public advantage, that
they might meanwhile protect themselves from injuries. But the fear of
laws did not suppress crimes, but it checked licentiousness. For laws
were able to punish offences, they were unable to punish the conscience.
Therefore the things which before were done openly began to be done
secretly. Justice also was evaded by stealth, since they who themselves
presided over the administration of the laws, corrupted by, gifts and
rewards, made a traffic of their sentences, either to the escape <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) of the evil or to the destruction
of the good. To these things were added dissensions, and wars, and
mutual depredations; and the laws being crushed, the power of acting
with violence was assumed without restraint.
