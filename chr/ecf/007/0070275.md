#### <span id="iii.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XII.—Of Religion and the Fear of God.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p1"></span>Now, since we have replied to the
impious and detestable wisdom, <span
id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713.md) or rather senselessness of some,
let us return to our proposed subject. We have said that, if religion is
taken away, neither wisdom nor justice can be retained: wisdom, because
the understanding of the divine nature, in which we differ from the
brutes, is found in man alone; justice, because unless God, who cannot
be deceived, shall restrain our desires, we shall live wickedly and
impiously. Therefore, that our actions should be viewed by God, pertains
not only to the usefulness of common life, but even to the truth;
because, if religion and justice are taken away, having lost our reason,
we either descend to the senselessness <span
id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714.md) of the herds; or to the savageness
of the beasts, yea, even more so, since the beasts spare animals of
their own kind. What will be more savage, what more unmerciful, than
man, if, the fear of a superior being taken away, he shall be able
either to escape the notice of or to despise the might of the laws? It
is therefore the fear of God alone which guards the mutual society of
men, by which life itself is sustained, protected, and governed. But
that fear is taken away if man is persuaded that God is without anger;
for that He is moved and indignant when unjust actions are done, not
only the common advantage, but even reason itself, and truth, persuade
us. We must again return to the former subjects, that, as we have taught
that the world was made by God, we may teach why it was made.
