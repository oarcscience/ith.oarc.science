<span id="iii.ii.i.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p0.1"></span>Chap. V.—Of the testimonies of poets and philosophers.

<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p1"></span>But let us leave the testimony of
prophets, lest a proof derived from those who are universally
disbelieved should appear insufficient. Let us come to authors, and for
the demonstration of the truth let us cite as witnesses those very
persons whom they are accustomed to make use of against us,—I mean poets
and philosophers. From these we cannot fail in proving the unity of God;
not that they had ascertained the truth, but that the force of the truth
itself is so great, that no one can be so blind as not to see the divine
brightness presenting itself to his eyes. The poets, therefore, however
much they adorned the gods in their poems, and amplified their exploits
with the highest praises, yet very frequently confess that all things
are held together and governed by one spirit or mind. <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p1.1"></span>Orpheus, who is the most ancient of the
poets, and coeval with the gods themselves,—since it is reported that he
sailed among the Argonauts together with the sons of <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p1.2"></span>Tyndarus and <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p1.3"></span>Hercules,—speaks of the true and great God
as the first-born, <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) because nothing
was produced before Him, but all things sprung from Him. He also calls
Him Phanes <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) because when as yet
there was nothing He first appeared and came forth from the infinite.
And since he was unable to conceive in his mind the origin and nature of
this Being, he said that He was born from the boundless air: “The
first-born, Phaethon, son of the extended air;” for he had nothing more
to say. He affirms that this Being is the Parent of all the gods, on
whose account He framed the heaven, and provided for His children that
they might have a habitation and place of abode in common: “He built for
immortals an imperishable home.” Thus, under the guidance of nature and
reason, he understood that there was a power of surpassing <span
id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-Page_14"></span>greatness which framed heaven and earth.
For he could not say that <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p3.2"></span>Jupiter was
the author of all things, since he was born from Saturn; nor could he
say that Saturn himself was their author, since it was reported that he
was produced from the heaven; but he did not venture to set up the
heaven as the primeval god, because he saw that it was an element of the
universe, and must itself have had an author. This consideration led him
to that first-born god, to whom he assigns and gives the first place.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p4"></span><span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p4.1"></span>Homer was able to give us no information
relating to the truth, for he wrote of human rather than divine things.
<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p4.2"></span>Hesiod was able, for he comprised in
the work of one book the generation of the gods; but yet he gave us no
information, for he took his commencement not from God the Creator, but
from chaos, which is a confused mass of rude and unarranged matter;
whereas he ought first to have explained from what source, at what time,
and in what manner, chaos itself had begun to exist or to have
consistency. Without doubt, as all things were placed in order,
arranged, and made by some artificer, so matter itself must of necessity
have been formed by some being. Who, then, made it except God, to whose
power all things are subject? But he shrinks from admitting this, while
he dreads the unknown truth. For, as he wished it to appear, it was by
the inspiration of the Muses that he poured forth that song on Helicon;
but he had come after previous meditation and preparation.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p5"></span><span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p5.1"></span>Maro
was the first of our poets to approach the truth, who thus speaks
respecting the highest God, whom he calls Mind and Spirit: <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p6.2"></span> “Know first, the heaven, the
> earth, the main,  
> The moon’s pale orb, the starry train,  
> Are nourished by a Soul,  
> A Spirit, whose celestial flame  
> Glows in each member of the frame,  
> And stirs the mighty whole.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p7"></span>And lest any one should happen to be
ignorant what that Spirit was which had so much power, he has declared
it in another place, saying: <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) “For
the Deity pervades all lands, the tracts of sea and depth of heaven; the
flocks, the herds, and men, and all the race of beasts, each at its
birth, derive their slender lives from Him.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p9"></span><span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p9.1"></span>Ovid
also, in the beginning of his remarkable work, without any disguising of
the name, admits that the universe was arranged by God, whom he calls
the Framer of the world, the Artificer of all things. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) But if either <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p10.1"></span>Orpheus or these poets of our country had
always maintained what they perceived under the guidance of nature, they
would have comprehended the truth, and gained the same learning which we
follow. <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p12"></span>But thus far of the poets. Let us come
to the philosophers, whose authority is of greater weight, and their
judgment more to be relied on, because they are believed to have paid
attention, not to matters of fiction, but to the investigation of the
truth. <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p12.1"></span>Thales of Miletus, who was
one of the number of the seven wise men, and who is said to have been
the first of all to inquire respecting natural causes, said that water
was the element from which all things were produced, and that God was
the mind which formed all things from water. Thus he placed the material
of all things in moisture; he fixed the beginning and cause of their
production in God. <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p12.2"></span>Pythagoras thus
defined the being of God, “as a soul passing to and fro, and diffused
through all parts of the universe, and through all nature, from which
all living creatures which are produced derive their life.” <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p12.3"></span>Anaxagoras said that God was an infinite
mind, which moves by its own power. <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p12.4"></span>Antisthenes maintained that the gods of
the people were many, but that the God of nature was one only; that is,
the Fabricator of the whole universe. <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p12.5"></span>Cleanthes and <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p12.6"></span>Anaximenes assert that the air is the
chief deity; and to this opinion our poet has assented: <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) “Then almighty father Æther descends in
fertile showers into the bosom of his joyous spouse; and great himself,
mingling with her great body, nourishes all her offspring.” <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p13.3"></span>Chrysippus speaks of God as a natural
power endowed with divine reason, and sometimes as a divine necessity.
<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p13.4"></span>Zeno also speaks of Him as a divine
and natural law. The opinion of all these, however uncertain it is, has
reference to one point,—to their agreement in the existence of one
providence. For whether it be nature, or æther, or reason, or mind, or a
fatal necessity, or a divine law, or if you term it anything else, it is
the same which is called by us God. Nor does the diversity of titles
prove an obstacle, since by their very signification they all refer to
one object. <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p13.5"></span>Aristotle, although he
is at variance with himself, and both utters and holds sentiments
opposed to one another, yet upon the whole bears witness that one Mind
presides over the universe. <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p13.6"></span>Plato,
who is judged the wisest of all, plainly and openly maintains the rule
of one God; nor does he name Him Æther, or Reason, or Nature, but, as He
truly is, God, and that this universe, so perfect and wonderful, was
fabricated by Him. And <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p13.7"></span>Cicero,
following and imitating him in many instances, frequently acknowledges
God, and calls Him supreme, in those books which he wrote on the <span
id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span id="iii.ii.i.vi-Page_15"></span>subject
of laws; and he adduces proof that the universe is governed by Him, when
he argues respecting the nature of the gods in this way: “Nothing is
superior to God: the world must therefore be governed by Him. Therefore
God is obedient or subject to no nature; consequently He Himself governs
all nature.” But what God Himself is he defines in his <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p13.8"></span>Consolation: <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) “Nor can God Himself, as He is
comprehended by us, be comprehended in any other way than as a mind free
and unrestrained, far removed from all mortal materiality, perceiving
and moving all things.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.vi-p15"></span>How often, also, does <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p15.1"></span>Annæus Seneca, who was the keenest Stoic
of the Romans, follow up with deserved praise the supreme Deity! For
when he was discussing the subject of premature death, he said “You do
not understand the authority and majesty of your Judge, the Ruler of the
world, and the God of heaven and of all gods, on whom those deities
which we separately worship and honour are dependent.” Also in his <span
id="iii.ii.i.vi-p15.2"></span>Exhortations: “This Being, when He was
laying the first foundations of the most beautiful fabric, and was
commencing this work, than which nature has known nothing greater or
better, that all things might serve their own rulers, although He had
spread Himself out through the whole body, yet He produced gods as
ministers of His kingdom.” And how many other things like to our own
writers did he speak on the subject of God! But these things I put off
for the present, because they are more suited to other parts of the
subject. At present it is enough to demonstrate that men of the highest
genius touched upon the truth, and almost grasped it, had not custom,
infatuated by false opinions, carried them back; by which custom they
both deemed that there were other gods, and believed that those things
which God made for the use of man, as though they were endowed with
perception, were to be held and worshipped as gods.
