#### <span id="iii.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chap. IX.—Of the Senses and Their Power.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p1"></span>It pleases me in this place to censure
the folly of those who, while they wish to show that the senses are
false, collect many instances in which the eyes are deceived; and among
them this also, that all things appear double to the mad and
intoxicated, as though the cause of that error were obscure. For it
happens on this account, because there are two eyes. But hear how it
happens. The sight of the eyes consists in the exertion of the soul.
Therefore, since the mind, as has been above said, uses the eyes as
windows, this happens not only to those who are intoxicated or mad, but
even to those who are of sound mind, and sober. For if you place any
object too near, it will appear double, for there is a certain interval
and space in which the sight of the eyes meets together. Likewise, if
you call the soul back as if to reflection, and relax the exertion of
the mind, then the sight of each eye is drawn asunder, and they each
begin to see separately.  

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p2"></span>If you, again, exert the mind and direct
the eyesight, whatever appeared double unites into one. What wonder,
therefore, if the mind, impaired by poison and the powerful influence of
wine, cannot direct itself to seeing, as the feet cannot to walking when
they are weak through the numbness of the sinews, or if the force of
madness raging against the brain disunites the agreement of the eyes?
Which is so true, that in the case of one-eyed <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) men, if they become either mad or
intoxicated, it can by no means happen that they see any object double.
Wherefore, if the reason is evident why the eyes are deceived, it is
clear that the senses are not false: for they either are not deceived if
they are pure and sound; or if they are deceived, yet the mind is not
deceived which recognises their error.
