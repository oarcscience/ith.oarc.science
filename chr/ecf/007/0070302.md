#### <span id="iii.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XV.—Of the Voice.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p1"></span>But what account can we give of the
voice? Grammarians, indeed, and philosophers, define the voice to be air
struck by the breath; from which words <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913.md) derive their name: which is plainly
false. For the voice is not produced outside of the mouth, but within,
and therefore that opinion is more probable, that the breath, being
compressed, when it has struck against the obstacle presented by the
throat, forces out the sound of the voice: as when we send down the
breath into an open hemlock stalk, having applied it to the lips, and
the breath, reverberating from the hollow of the stalk, and rolled back
from the bottom, while it returns <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914.md) to that descending through meeting
with itself, striving for an outlet, produces a sound; and the wind,
rebounding by itself, is animated into vocal breath. Now, whether this
is true, God, who is the designer, may see. For the voice appears to
arise not from the mouth, but from the innermost breast. In fine, even
when the mouth is closed, a sound such as is possible is emitted from
the nostrils. <span id="page_296">p. 296</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xv-Page_296"></span>Moreover, also, the voice is not affected
by that greatest breath with which we gasp, but with a light and not
compressed breath, as often as we wish. It has not therefore been
comprehended in what manner it takes place, or what it is altogether.
And do not imagine that I am now falling into the opinion of the
Academy, for all things are not incomprehensible. For as it must be
confessed that many things are unknown, since God has willed that they
should exceed the understanding of man; so, however, it must be
acknowledged that there are many which may both be perceived by the
senses and comprehended by the reason. But we shall devote an entire
treatise to the refutation of the philosophers. Let us therefore finish
the course over which we are now running.
