#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chap. VIII.—Of Æsculapius, Apollo, Mars, Castor and Pollux, and of Mercurius and Bacchus.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.1"></span>Tarquitius relates that <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.2"></span>Æsculapius was born of doubtful parents,
and that on this account he was exposed; and being taken up by hunters,
and fed by the teats of a hound, was given to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.3"></span>Chiron for instruction. He lived at
Epidaurus, and was buried at Cynosuræ, as <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p1.4"></span>Cicero says, <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) when he had been killed by
lightning. But <span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p2.3"></span>Apollo, his father,
did not disdain to take charge of another’s flock that he might receive
a wife; <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) and when he had
unintentionally killed a boy whom he loved, he inscribed his own
lamentations on a flower. <span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p3.6"></span>Mars, a
man of the greatest bravery, was not free from the charge of adultery,
since he was made a spectacle, being bound with a chain together with
the adulteress.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.1"></span>Castor and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.2"></span>Pollux carried off the brides of others,
but not with impunity, to whose death and burial <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.3"></span>Homer bears witness, not with poetical,
but simple faith. <span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.4"></span>Mercurius, who
was the father of <span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.5"></span>Androgynus by
his intrigue with <span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.6"></span>Venus, deserved
to be a god, because he invented the lyre and the <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.7"></span>palæstra. Father <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.8"></span>Bacchus, after subduing India as a
conqueror, having by chance come to Crete, saw <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.9"></span>Ariadne on the shore, whom <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p4.10"></span>Theseus had forced and deserted. Then,
being inflamed by love, he united her in marriage to <span
id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-Page_227"></span>himself, and placed her crown, as
the poets say, conspicuously among the stars. The mother of the
gods <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) herself, while she lived
in Phrygia after the banishment and death of her husband, though a
widow, and aged, was enamoured of a beautiful youth; and because he was
not faithful, she mutilated, and rendered him effeminate: on which
account even now she delights in the <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p5.3"></span>Galli <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) as her priests.

her in a chariot drawn by lions and boars, <span

<span id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p6"></span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p6.1"></span>Galli, the priests of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.ix-p6.2"></span>Cybele, were so called: they mutilated
themselves, and performed many raving ceremonies.
