<span id="iii.ii.i.i"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.i.i-p0.1"></span>preface.—of what great value the knowledge of the truth is and always has been.

<span id="iii.ii.i.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii.i.i-p1.1"></span>Men</span> of great and distinguished
talent, when they had entirely devoted themselves to learning, holding
in contempt all actions both private and public, applied to the pursuit
of investigating the truth whatever labour could be bestowed upon it;
thinking it much more excellent to investigate and know the method of
human and divine things, than to be entirely occupied with the heaping
up of riches or the accumulation of honours. For no one can be made
better or more just by these things, since they are frail and earthly,
and pertain to the adorning of the body only. Those men were indeed most
deserving of the knowledge of the truth, which they so greatly desired
to know, that they even preferred it to all things. For it is plain that
some gave up their property, and altogether abandoned the pursuit of
pleasures, that, being disengaged and without impediment, they might
follow the simple truth, and it alone. And so greatly did the name and
authority of the truth prevail with them, that they proclaimed that the
reward of the greatest good was contained in it. But they did not obtain
the object of their wish, and at the same time lost their labour and
industry; because the truth, that is the secret of the Most High God,
who created all things, cannot be attained by our own ability and
perceptions. Otherwise there would be no difference between God and man,
if human thought could reach to the counsels and arrangements of that
eternal majesty. And because it was impossible that the divine method of
procedure should become known to man by his own efforts, God did not
suffer man any longer to err in search of the light of wisdom, and to
wander through inextricable darkness without any result of his labour,
but at length opened his eyes, and made the investigation of the truth
His own gift, so that He might show the nothingness of human wisdom, and
point out to man wandering in error the way of obtaining immortality.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.i-p2"></span>But since few make use of this heavenly
benefit and gift, because the truth lies hidden veiled in obscurity; and
it is either an object of contempt to the learned because it has not
suitable defenders, or is hated by the unlearned on account of its
natural severity, which the nature of men inclined to vices cannot
endure: for because there is a bitterness mingled with virtues, while
vices are seasoned with pleasure, offended by the former and soothed by
the latter, they are borne headlong, and deceived by the appearance of
good things, they embrace evils for goods,—I have believed that these
errors should be encountered, that both the learned may be directed to
true wisdom, and the unlearned to true religion. And this profession is
to be thought much better, more useful and glorious, than that of
oratory, in which being long engaged, we trained young men not to
virtue, but altogether to cunning wickedness. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) Certainly we shall now much more rightly
discuss respecting the heavenly precepts, by which we may be able to
instruct the minds of men to the worship of the true majesty. Nor does
he deserve so well respecting the affairs of men, who imparts the
knowledge of speaking well, as he who teaches men to live in piety and
innocence; on which account the philosophers were in greater glory among
the Greeks than the orators. For they, <span
id="iii.ii.i.i-p3.4"></span>the philosophers, were considered teachers
of right living, which is far more excellent, since to speak well
belongs only to a few, but to live well belongs to all. Yet that
practice in fictitious suits has been of great advantage to us, so that
we are now able to plead the cause of truth with greater copiousness and
ability of speaking; for although the truth may be defended without
eloquence, as it often has <span id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i.i-Page_10"></span>been defended by many, yet it needs to be
explained, and in a measure discussed, with distinctness and elegance of
speech, in order that it may flow with greater power into the minds of
men, being both provided with its own force, and adorned with the
brilliancy of speech.
