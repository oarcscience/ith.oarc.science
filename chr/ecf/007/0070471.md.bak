#### <span id="ix.ix.vi-p0.1"></span>The Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles. <span id="fr_3768"></span>[3769](#fn_3768.md)

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ix.vi-p2.1"></span>XLVII</span>.1. Let a bishop be ordained by
two or three bishops.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p3"></span>2. A presbyter by one bishop, as also a
deacon, and the rest of the clergy. <span
id="fr_3769"></span>[3770](#fn_3769.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p5"></span>3. If any bishop or presbyter, otherwise
than our Lord has ordained concerning the sacrifice, offer other things
at the altar <span id="ix.ix.vi-p5.1"></span>of God, as honey, milk, or
strong beer instead of wine, any necessaries, or birds, or animals, or
pulse, otherwise than is ordained, let him be deprived; excepting grains
of new corn, or ears of wheat, or bunches of grapes in their
season. <span id="fr_3770"></span>[3771](#fn_3770.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p7"></span>4. For it is not lawful to offer anything
besides these at the altar, and oil for the holy lamp, and incense in
the time of the divine oblation.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p8"></span>5. But let all other fruits be sent to the
house of the bishop, as first-fruits to him and to the presbyters, but
not to the altar. Now it is plain that the bishop and presbyters are to
divide them to the deacons and to the rest of the clergy.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p9"></span>6. Let not a bishop, a priest, or a
deacon <span id="fr_3771"></span>[3772](#fn_3771.md) cast off his own wife
under pretence of piety; but if he does cast her off, let him be
suspended. If he go on in it, let him be deprived.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p11"></span>7. Let not a bishop, a priest, or deacon
undertake the cares of this world; but if he do, let him be
deprived. <span id="fr_3772"></span>[3773](#fn_3772.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p13"></span>8. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon
shall celebrate the holiday of the passover before the vernal equinox
with the Jews, let him be deprived. <span
id="fr_3773"></span>[3774](#fn_3773.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p15"></span>9. If any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon, or any one of the catalogue of the priesthood, when the oblation
is over, does not communicate, let <span id="page_501">p. 501</span>
<span id="ix.ix.vi-Page_501"></span>him give his reason; and if it be
just, let him be forgiven; but if he does not do it, let him be
suspended, as becoming the cause of damage to the people, and
occasioning a suspicion against him that offered, as of one that did not
rightly offer. <span id="fr_3774"></span>[3775](#fn_3774.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p17"></span>10. All those of the faithful that enter
<span id="ix.ix.vi-p17.1"></span>into the holy church of God, and hear
the sacred Scriptures, but do not stay during prayer and the holy
communion, must be suspended, as causing disorder in the church.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p18"></span>11. If any one, even in the house, prays
with a person excommunicate, let him also be suspended.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p19"></span>12. If any clergyman prays with one
deprived as with a clergyman, let himself also be deprived.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p20"></span>13. If any clergyman or layman who is
suspended, or ought not to be received, <span
id="fr_3775"></span>[3776](#fn_3775.md) goes away, and is received in
another city without commendatory letters, let both those who received
him and he that was received be suspended. But if he be already
suspended, let his suspension be lengthened, as lying to and deceiving
the Church of God.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p22"></span>14. A bishop ought not to leave his own
parish and leap to another, although the multitude should compel him,
unless there be some good reason forcing him to do this, as that he can
contribute much greater profit to the people of the new parish by the
word of piety; but this is not to be settled by himself, but by the
judgment of many bishops, and very great supplication.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p23"></span>15. If any presbyter or deacon, or any
one of the catalogue of the clergy, leaves his own parish and goes to
another, and, entirely removing himself, continues in that other parish
without the consent of his own bishop, him we command no longer to go on
in his ministry, especially in case his bishop calls upon him to return,
and he does not obey, but continues in his disorder. However, let him
communicate there as a layman.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p24"></span>16. But if the bishop with whom they are
undervalues the deprivation decreed against them, and receives them as
clergymen, let him be suspended as a teacher of disorder.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p25"></span>17. He who has been twice married after
his baptism, or has had a concubine, cannot be made a bishop, or
presbyter, or deacon, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal
catalogue. <span id="fr_3776"></span>[3777](#fn_3776.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p27"></span>18. He who has taken a widow, or a
divorced woman, or an harlot, or a servant, or one belonging to the
theatre, cannot be either a bishop, priest, or deacon, or indeed any one
of the sacerdotal catalogue.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p28"></span>19. He who has married two sisters, or
his brother’s or sister’s daughter, cannot be a clergyman.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p29"></span>20. Let a clergyman who becomes a surety
be deprived.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p30"></span>21. Let an eunuch, if he be such by the
injury of men, or his <span class="Foreign"><span
id="ix.ix.vi-p30.1"></span>virilia</span> were taken away in the
persecution, or he was born such, and yet is worthy of episcopacy, be
made a bishop.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p31"></span>22. Let not him who has disabled himself
be made a clergyman; for he is a self-murderer, and an enemy to the
creation of God. <span id="fr_3777"></span>[3778](#fn_3777.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p33"></span>23. If any one who is of the clergy
disables himself, let him be deprived, for he is a murderer of himself.
 

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p34"></span>24. Let a layman who disables himself be
separated for three years, for he lays a snare for his own life. <span
id="fr_3778"></span>[3779](#fn_3778.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p36"></span>25. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon
who is taken in fornication, or perjury, or stealing, be deprived, <span
id="ix.ix.vi-p36.1"></span>but not suspended; for the Scripture says:
“Thou shall not avenge twice for the same crime by affliction.” <span
id="fr_3779"></span>[3780](#fn_3779.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p38"></span>26. In like manner also as to the rest of
the clergy.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p39"></span>27. Of those who come into the clergy
unmarried, we permit only the readers and singers, if they have a mind,
to marry afterward. <span id="fr_3780"></span>[3781](#fn_3780.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p41"></span>28. We command that a bishop, or
presbyter, or deacon who strikes the faithful that offend, or the
unbelievers who do wickedly, and thinks to terrify them by such means,
be deprived, for our Lord has nowhere taught us such things. On the
contrary, “when Himself was stricken, He did not strike again; when He
was reviled, He reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened
not.” <span id="fr_3781"></span>[3782](#fn_3781.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p43"></span>29. If any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon who is deprived justly for manifest crimes, does venture to
meddle with that ministration which was once entrusted to him, let the
same person be entirely cut off from the Church.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p44"></span>30. If any bishop obtains that dignity by
money, or even a presbyter or deacon, let him and the person that
ordained him be deprived; and let him be entirely cut off from
communion, as <span id="ix.ix.vi-p44.1"></span>Simon Magus was by <span
id="ix.ix.vi-p44.2"></span>me <span
id="ix.ix.vi-p44.3"></span>Peter. <span
id="fr_3782"></span>[3783](#fn_3782.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p46"></span>31. If any bishop makes use of the rulers
of this world, and by their means obtains to be a bishop of a church,
let him be deprived and suspended, and all that communicate with him.
<span id="page_502">p. 502</span> <span id="ix.ix.vi-Page_502"></span>  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p47"></span>32. If any presbyter despises his own
bishop, and assembles separately, and fixes another altar, when he has
nothing to condemn in his bishop either as to piety or righteousness,
let him be deprived as an ambitious person; for he is a tyrant, and the
rest of the clergy, whoever join themselves to him. And let the laity be
suspended. But let these things be done after one, and a second, or even
a third admonition from the bishop. <span
id="fr_3783"></span>[3784](#fn_3783.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p49"></span>33. If any presbyter or deacon be put
under suspension by his bishop, it is not lawful for any other to
receive him, but for him only who put him under suspension, unless it
happens that he who put him under suspension die.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p50"></span>34. Do not ye receive any stranger,
whether bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, without commendatory letters;
and when such are offered, let them be examined. And if they be
preachers of piety, let them be received; but if not, supply their
wants, but do not receive them to communion: for many things are done by
surprise.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p51"></span>35. The bishops of every country ought to
know who is the chief among them, and to esteem him as their head, and
not to do any great thing without his consent; but every one to manage
only the affairs that belong to his own parish, and the places subject
to it. But let him not do anything without the consent of all; for it is
by this means there will be unanimity, and God will be glorified by
Christ, in the Holy Spirit.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p52"></span>36. A bishop must not venture to ordain
out of his own bounds for cities or countries that are not subject to
him. But if he be convicted of having done so without the consent of
such as governed those cities or countries, let him be deprived, both
the bishop himself and those whom he has ordained.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p53"></span>37. If any bishop that is ordained does
not undertake his office, nor take care of the people committed to him,
let him be suspended until he do undertake it; and in the like manner a
presbyter and a deacon. But if he goes, and is not received, not because
of the want of his own consent, but because of the ill temper of the
people, let him continue bishop; but let the clergy of that city be
suspended, because they have not taught that disobedient people better.
 

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p54"></span>38. Let a synod of bishops be held twice
in the year, and let them ask one another the doctrines of piety; and
let them determine the ecclesiastical disputes that happen—once in the
fourth week of Pentecost, and again on the twelfth of the month <span
id="ix.ix.vi-p54.1"></span>Hyperberetæus.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p55"></span>39. Let the bishop have the care of
ecclesiastical revenues, and administer them as in the presence of God.
But it is not lawful for him to appropriate any part of them to himself,
or to give the things of God to his own kindred. But if they be poor,
let him support them as poor; but let him not, under such pretences,
alienate the revenues of the Church.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p56"></span>40. Let not the presbyters and deacons do
anything without the consent of the bishop, for it is he who is
entrusted with the people of the Lord, and will be required to give an
account of their souls. Let the proper goods of the bishop, if he has
any, and those belonging to the Lord, be openly distinguished, that he
may have power when he dies to leave his own goods as he pleases, and to
whom he pleases; that, under pretence of the ecclesiastical revenues,
the bishop’s own may not come short, who sometimes has a wife and
children, or kinsfolk, or servants. For this is just before God and men,
that neither the Church suffer any loss by the not knowing which
revenues are the bishop’s own, nor his kindred, under pretence of the
Church, be undone, or his relations fall into lawsuits, and so his death
be liable to reproach. <span id="fr_3784"></span>[3785](#fn_3784.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p58"></span>41. We command that the bishop have power
over the goods of the Church; for if he be entrusted with the precious
souls of men, much more ought he to give directions about goods, that
they all be distributed to those in want, according to his authority, by
the presbyters and deacons, and be used for their support with the fear
of God, and with all reverence. He is also to partake of those things he
wants, if he does want them, for his necessary occasions, and those of
the brethren who live with him, that they may not by any means be in
straits: for the law of God appointed that those who waited at the altar
should be maintained by the altar; since not so much as a soldier does
at any time bear arms against the enemies at his own charges.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p59"></span>42. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon
who indulges himself in dice or drinking, either leave off those
practices, or let him be deprived. <span
id="fr_3785"></span>[3786](#fn_3785.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p61"></span>43. If a sub-deacon, a reader, or a
singer does the like, either let him leave off, or let him be suspended;
and so for one of the laity.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p62"></span>44. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon
who requires usury of those he lends to, either leave off to do so, or
let him be deprived.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p63"></span>45. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon
who only prays with heretics, be suspended; but if he also permit them
to perform any part of the office of a clergyman, let him be
deprived. <span id="fr_3786"></span>[3787](#fn_3786.md) <span
id="page_503">p. 503</span> <span id="ix.ix.vi-Page_503"></span>  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p65"></span>46. We command that a bishop, or
presbyter, or deacon who receives the baptism, or the sacrifice of
heretics, be deprived: “For what agreement is there between Christ and
Belial? or what part hath a believer with an infidel?” <span
id="fr_3787"></span>[3788](#fn_3787.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p67"></span>47. If a bishop or presbyter rebaptizes
him who has had true baptism, or does not baptize him who is polluted by
the ungodly, let him be deprived, as ridiculing the cross and the death
of the Lord, and not distinguishing between real priests and counterfeit
ones.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p68"></span>48. If a layman divorces his own wife,
and takes another, or one divorced by another, let him be
suspended. <span id="fr_3788"></span>[3789](#fn_3788.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p70"></span>49. If any bishop or presbyter does not
baptize according to the Lord’s constitution, into the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, but into three beings without beginning, or into
three Sons, or three Comforters, let him be deprived. <span
id="fr_3789"></span>[3790](#fn_3789.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p72"></span>50. If any bishop or presbyter does not
perform the three immersions of the one admission, but one immersion,
which is given into the death of Christ, let him be deprived; for the
Lord did not say, “Baptize into my death,” but, “Go ye and make
disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Do ye, therefore, O bishops,
baptize thrice into one Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, according to
the will of Christ, and our constitution by the Spirit. <span
id="fr_3790"></span>[3791](#fn_3790.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p74"></span>51. If any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue, abstains from
marriage, flesh, and wine, not for his own exercise, but because he
abominates these things, forgetting that “all things were very
good,” <span id="fr_3791"></span>[3792](#fn_3791.md) and that “God made man
male and female,” <span id="fr_3792"></span>[3793](#fn_3792.md) and
blasphemously abuses the creation, either let him reform, or let him be
deprived, and be cast out of the Church; and the same for one of the
laity. <span id="fr_3793"></span>[3794](#fn_3793.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p78"></span>52. If any bishop or presbyter does not
receive him that returns from his sin, but rejects him, let him be
deprived; because he grieves Christ, who says, “There is joy in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth.” <span
id="fr_3794"></span>[3795](#fn_3794.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p80"></span>53. If any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon does not on festival days partake of flesh or wine, let him be
deprived, as “having a seared conscience,” <span
id="fr_3795"></span>[3796](#fn_3795.md) and becoming a cause of scandal to
many.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p82"></span>54. If any one of the clergy be taken
eating in a tavern, let him be suspended, excepting when he is forced to
bait at an inn upon the road. <span id="fr_3796"></span>[3797](#fn_3796.md)
 

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p84"></span>55. If any one of the clergy abuses his
bishop unjustly, let him be deprived; for says the Scripture, “Thou
shall not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.” <span
id="fr_3797"></span>[3798](#fn_3797.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p86"></span>56. If any one of the clergy abuses a
presbyter or a deacon, let him be separated.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p87"></span>57. If any one of the clergy mocks at a
lame, a deaf, or a blind man, or at one maimed in his feet, let him be
suspended; and the like for the laity.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p88"></span>58. Let a bishop or presbyter who takes
no care of the clergy or people, and does not instruct them in piety, be
separated; and if he continues in his negligence, let him be
deprived. <span id="fr_3798"></span>[3799](#fn_3798.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p90"></span>59. If any bishop or presbyter, when any
one of the clergy is in want, does not supply his necessity, let him be
suspended; and if he continues in it, let him be deprived, as having
killed his brother. <span id="fr_3799"></span>[3800](#fn_3799.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p92"></span>60. If any one publicly reads in the
Church the spurious books of the ungodly, as if they were holy, to the
destruction of the people and of the clergy, let him be deprived. <span
id="fr_3800"></span>[3801](#fn_3800.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p94"></span>61. If there be an accusation against a
Christian for fornication, or adultery, or any other forbidden action,
and he be convicted, let him not be promoted into the clergy.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p95"></span>62. If any one of the clergy for fear of
men, <span id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span
id="ix.ix.vi-Page_504"></span>as of a Jew, or a Gentile, or an heretic,
shall deny the name of Christ, let him be suspended; but if he deny the
name of a clergyman, let him be deprived; but when he repents, let him
be received as one of the laity. <span
id="fr_3801"></span>[3802](#fn_3801.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p97"></span>63. If any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue, eats flesh with
the blood of its life, or that which is torn by beasts, or which died of
itself, let him be deprived; for this the law itself has
forbidden. <span id="fr_3802"></span>[3803](#fn_3802.md) But if he be one
of the laity, let him be suspended. <span
id="fr_3803"></span>[3804](#fn_3803.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p100"></span>64. If any one of the clergy be found to
fast on the Lord’s day, or on the Sabbath-day, excepting one only, let
him be deprived; but if he be one of the laity, let him be
suspended. <span id="fr_3804"></span>[3805](#fn_3804.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p102"></span>65. If any one, either of the clergy or
laity, enters into a synagogue of the Jews or heretics to pray, let him
be deprived and suspended. <span id="fr_3805"></span>[3806](#fn_3805.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p104"></span>66. If any one of the clergy strikes one
in a quarrel, and kills him by that one stroke, let him be deprived, on
account of his rashness; but if he be one of the laity, let him be
suspended. <span id="fr_3806"></span>[3807](#fn_3806.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p106"></span>67. If any one has offered violence to a
virgin not betrothed, and keeps her, let him be suspended. But it is not
lawful for him to take another to wife; but he must retain her whom he
has chosen, although she be poor. <span
id="fr_3807"></span>[3808](#fn_3807.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p108"></span>68. If any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon, receives a second ordination from any one, let him be deprived,
and the person who ordained him, unless he can show that his former
ordination was from the heretics; for those that are either baptized or
ordained by such as these, can be neither Christians nor
clergymen. <span id="fr_3808"></span>[3809](#fn_3808.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p110"></span>69. If any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon, or reader, or singer, does not fast the fast of forty days, or
the fourth day of the week, and the day of the Preparation, let him be
deprived, except he be hindered by weakness of body. But if he be one of
the laity, let him be suspended. <span
id="fr_3809"></span>[3810](#fn_3809.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p112"></span>70. If any bishop, or any other of the
clergy, fasts with the Jews, or keeps the festivals with them, or
accepts of the presents from their festivals, as unleavened bread or
some such thing, let him be deprived; but if he be one of the laity, let
him be suspended. <span id="fr_3810"></span>[3811](#fn_3810.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p114"></span>71. If any Christian carries oil into an
heathen temple, or into a synagogue of the Jews, or lights up lamps in
their festivals, let him be suspended.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p115"></span>72. If any one, either of the clergy or
laity, takes away from the holy Church an honeycomb, or oil, let him be
suspended, and let him add the fifth part to that which he took
away. <span id="fr_3811"></span>[3812](#fn_3811.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p117"></span>73. A vessel of silver, or gold, or
linen, which is sanctified, let no one appropriate to his own use, for
it is unjust; but if any one be caught, let him be punished with
suspension. <span id="fr_3812"></span>[3813](#fn_3812.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p119"></span>74. If a bishop be accused of any crime
by credible and faithful persons, it is necessary that he be cited by
the bishops; and if he comes and makes his apology, and yet is
convicted, let his punishment be determined. But if, when he is cited,
he does not obey, let him be cited a second time, by two bishops sent to
him. But if even then he despises them, and will not come, let the synod
pass what sentence they please against him, that he may not appear to
gain advantage by avoiding their judgment. <span
id="fr_3813"></span>[3814](#fn_3813.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p121"></span>75. Do not ye receive an heretic in a
testimony against a bishop; nor a Christian if he be single. For the law
says, “In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be
established.” <span id="fr_3814"></span>[3815](#fn_3814.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p123"></span>76. A bishop must not gratify his
brother, or his son, or any other kinsman, with the episcopal dignity,
or ordain whom he pleases; for it is not just to make heirs to
episcopacy, and to gratify human affections in divine matters. For we
must not put the Church of God under the laws of inheritance; but if any
one shall do so, let his ordination be invalid, and let him be punished
with suspension. <span id="fr_3815"></span>[3816](#fn_3815.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p125"></span>77. If any one be maimed in an eye, or
lame of his leg, but is worthy of the episcopal dignity, let him be made
a bishop; for it is not a blemish of the body that can defile him, but
the pollution of the soul. <span id="fr_3816"></span>[3817](#fn_3816.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p127"></span>78. But if he be deaf and blind, let him
not be made a bishop; not as being a defiled person, but that the
ecclesiastical affairs may not be hindered.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p128"></span>79. If any one hath a demon, let him not
be made one of the clergy. Nay, let him not pray with the faithful; but
when he is cleansed, let him be received; and if he be worthy, let him
be ordained. <span id="fr_3817"></span>[3818](#fn_3817.md) <span
id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span id="ix.ix.vi-Page_505"></span>  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p130"></span>80. It is not right to ordain him bishop
presently who is just come in from the Gentiles, and baptized; or from a
wicked mode of life: for it is unjust that he who has not yet afforded
any trial of himself should be a teacher of others, unless it anywhere
happens by divine grace. <span id="fr_3818"></span>[3819](#fn_3818.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p132"></span>81. We have said that a bishop ought not
to let himself into public administrations, but to attend on all
opportunities upon the necessary affairs of the Church. <span
id="fr_3819"></span>[3820](#fn_3819.md) Either therefore let him agree not
to do so, or let him be deprived. For, “no one can serve two
masters,” <span id="fr_3820"></span>[3821](#fn_3820.md) according to the
Lord’s admonition. <span id="fr_3821"></span>[3822](#fn_3821.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p136"></span>82. We do not permit servants to be
ordained into the clergy without their masters’ consent; for this would
grieve those that owned them. For such a practice would occasion the
subversion of families. But if at any time a servant appears worthy to
be ordained into an high office, such as our <span
id="ix.ix.vi-p136.1"></span>Onesimus appeared to be, and if his master
allows of it, and gives him his freedom, and dismisses him from his
house, let him be ordained. <span id="fr_3822"></span>[3823](#fn_3822.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p138"></span>83. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon, who goes to the army, and desires to retain both the Roman
government and the sacerdotal administration, be deprived. For “the
things of Cæsar belong to Cæsar, and the things of God to God.” <span
id="fr_3823"></span>[3824](#fn_3823.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p140"></span>84. Whosoever shall abuse the king <span
id="fr_3824"></span>[3825](#fn_3824.md) or the governor unjustly, let him
suffer punishment; and if he be a clergyman, let him be deprived; but if
he be a layman, let him be suspended.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p142"></span>85. Let the following books be esteemed
venerable and holy by you, both of the clergy and laity. Of the Old
Covenant: the five books of <span
id="ix.ix.vi-p142.1"></span>Moses—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
and Deuteronomy; one of Joshua the son of Nun, one of the Judges, one of
Ruth, four of the Kings, two of the Chronicles, two of Ezra, one of
Esther, <span id="ix.ix.vi-p142.2"></span>one of Judith, three of the
Maccabees, one of Job, one hundred and fifty psalms; three books of
Solomon—Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs; sixteen prophets.
And besides these, take care that your young persons learn the Wisdom of
the very learned Sirach. But our sacred books, that is, those of the New
Covenant, are these: the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John;
the fourteen Epistles of Paul; two Epistles of Peter, three of John, one
of James, one of Jude; two Epistles of Clement; and the Constitutions
dedicated to you the bishops by me Clement, in eight books; which it is
not fit to publish before all, because of the mysteries contained in
them; and the Acts of us the Apostles. <span
id="fr_3825"></span>[3826](#fn_3825.md)  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p144"></span>Let these canonical rules be established
by us for you, O ye bishops; and if you continue to observe them, ye
shall be saved, and shall have peace; but if you be disobedient, you
shall be punished, and have everlasting war one with another, and
undergo a penalty suitable to your disobedience.  

<span id="ix.ix.vi-p145"></span>Now, God who alone is unbegotten, and
the Maker of the whole world, unite you all through His peace, in the
Holy Spirit; perfect you unto every good work, immoveable, unblameable,
and unreprovable; and vouchsafe to you eternal life with us, through the
mediation of His beloved Son <span id="ix.ix.vi-p145.1"></span>Jesus
Christ our God and Saviour; with whom glory be to Thee, the God over
all, and the Father, in the Holy Spirit the Comforter, now and always,
and for ever and ever. Amen.

Apostles by <span id="ix.ix.vi-p146.1"></span>Clement, which are the

among the most recent. Of unknown origin.—R.\] At the end of this canon,
in the collection of <span id="ix.ix.vi-p73.2"></span>John of Antioch,
the following words are added: “Let him that is baptized be taught that
the Father was not crucified, nor endured to be born of man, nor indeed
that the Holy Spirit became man, or even endured suffering, for He was
not made flesh; but the only begotten Son ransomed the world from the
wrath which lay upon it: for He became man through His love of man,
having fashioned a body for Himself from a virgin. For Wisdom built a
house for herself as a Creator; but He willingly endured the cross, and
rescued the world from the wrath that lies on it, namely, those who are
baptized into the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
But let those who do not thus baptize be suspended, as being ignorant of
the mystery of piety.” The same collection gives the following as Canon
51: “He who says that the Father suffered is more impious than the Jews,
nailing along with Christ the Father also. He who denies that the only
begotten Son was made flesh for us, and endured the cross, fights with
God, and is an enemy of the saints. He that names the Holy Spirit Father
or Son, is ignorant and foolish; for the Son is Creator along with the
Father, and has the same throne, and is Lawgiver along with Him, and
Judge, and the cause of the resurrection; and the Holy Spirit is the
same in substance: for the Godhead has three Persons, the same in
substance. For in our day <span id="ix.ix.vi-p73.3"></span>Simon the
magician gave forth his doctrines, drawing the speechless, delusive,
unstable, and wicked spirit to himself, and babbling that there is one
God with three names, and sometimes erasing the passion and birth of
Christ. Do you, then, most beloved ones, baptize into one Father, and
Son, and the Holy Spirit as third, according to the will of the Lord,
and our constitution made in the spirit.”
