<span id="iii.ii.iv.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VII.—Of the Name of Son, and Whence He is Called <span id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p0.2"></span>Jesus and Christ.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p1"></span>Some one may perhaps ask who this is
who is so powerful, so beloved by God, and what name He has, who was not
only begotten at first before the world, <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) but who also arranged it by His <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.vii-Page_106"></span>wisdom and constructed it by His
might. First of all, it is befitting that we should know that His name
is not known even to the angels who dwell in heaven, but to Himself
only, and to God the Father; nor will that name be published, as the
sacred writings relate, before that the purpose of God shall be
fulfilled. In the next place, we must know that this name cannot be
uttered by the mouth of man, as <span
id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p2.2"></span>Hermes teaches, saying these things: “Now
the cause of this cause is the will of the divine good which produced
God, whose name cannot be uttered by the mouth of man.” And shortly
afterwards to His Son: “There is, O Son, a secret word of wisdom, holy
respecting the only Lord of all things, and the God first
perceived <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) by the mind, to speak
of whom is beyond the power of man.” But although His name, which the
supreme Father gave Him from the beginning, is known to none but
Himself, nevertheless He has one name among the angels, and another
among men, since He is called <span
id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p3.1"></span>Jesus <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) among men: for Christ is not a proper
name, but a title of power and dominion; for by this the Jews were
accustomed to call their kings. But the meaning of this name must be set
forth, on account of the error of the ignorant, who by the change of a
letter are accustomed to call Him Chrestus. <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) The Jews had before been directed to
compose a sacred oil, with which those who were called to the
priesthood <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) or to the kingdom
might be anointed. And as now the robe of purple <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) is a sign of the assumption of royal
dignity among the Romans, so with them the anointing with the holy oil
conferred the title and power of king. But since the ancient Greeks used
the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p7.6"></span>χρίεσθαι</span> to express the art of
anointing, which they now express by <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p7.7"></span>ἀλείφεσθαι</span>, as the verse of Homer
shows,  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p7.8"></span> “But the attendants washed, and
> anointed <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) them with oil;”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p9"></span>on this account we call Him Christ,
that is, the Anointed, who in Hebrew is called the Messias. Hence in
some Greek writings, which are badly translated <span
id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) from the Hebrew, the word <span
class="Foreign"><span
id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p10.2"></span>eleimmenos</span> <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) is found written, from the word <span
class="Foreign"><span
id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p11.2"></span>aleiphesthai</span>, <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) anointing. But, however, by either
name a king is signified: not that He has obtained this earthly kingdom,
the time for receiving which has not yet arrived, but that He sways a
heavenly and eternal kingdom, concerning which we shall speak in the
last book. But now let us speak of His first nativity.

Chrestians, as <span id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p5.2"></span>Tertullian shows in
his <span id="iii.ii.iv.vii-p5.3"></span>Apology. The word <span
