#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXI.—Of the Ascension of Jesus, and the Foretelling of It; And of the Preaching and Actions of the Disciples.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p1"></span>But when He had made arrangements
with His disciples for the preaching of the Gospel and His name, a cloud
suddenly surrounded Him, and carried Him up into heaven, on the fortieth
day after His passion, as <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Daniel
had shown that it would be, saying: <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798) “And, behold, one like the Son of man
came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days.” But
the disciples, being dispersed through the provinces, everywhere laid
the foundations of the Church, themselves also in the name of their
divine <span id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799) Master doing many and
almost incredible miracles; for at His departure He had endowed them
with power and strength, by which the system <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800) of their new announcement might be
founded and confirmed. But He also opened to them all things which were
about to happen, which <span id="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p4.1"></span>Peter and
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p4.2"></span>Paul preached at Rome; and this
preaching being written for the sake of remembrance, <span
id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801) became permanent, in which they both
declared other wonderful things, and also said that it was about to come
to pass, that after a short time God would send against them a king who
would subdue <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802) the Jews, and level
their cities to the ground, and besiege the people themselves, worn out
with hunger and thirst. Then it should come to pass that they should
feed on the bodies of their own children, and consume one another.
Lastly, that they should be taken captive, and come into the hands of
their enemies, and should see their wives most cruelly harassed before
their eyes, their virgins ravished and polluted, their sons torn in
pieces, their little ones dashed to the ground; and lastly, everything
laid waste with fire and sword, the captives banished for ever from
their own lands, because they had exulted over the well-beloved and most
approved Son of God. And so, after their decease, when <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p6.2"></span>Nero had put them to death, <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxi-p6.3"></span>Vespasian destroyed the name and nation
of the Jews, and did all <span id="page_124">p. 124</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xxi-Page_124"></span>things which they had foretold as
about to come to pass.
