#### <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIX.—Of Fortune Again, and Virtue.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p1"></span>But let us return to the subject
which we laid aside. Fortune, therefore, by itself, is nothing; nor must
we so regard it as though it had any perception, since fortune is the
sudden and unexpected occurrence of accidents. But philosophers, that
they may not sometimes fail to err, wish to be wise in a foolish matter;
and say that she is not a goddess, as is generally believed, but a god.
Sometimes, however, they call this god nature, sometimes fortune,
“because he brings about,” says the same <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Cicero, “many things unexpected by us,
on account of our want of intelligence and our ignorance of causes.”
Since, therefore, they are ignorant of the causes on account of which
anything is done, they must also be ignorant of him who does them. <span
id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-Page_99"></span>The
same writer, in a work of great seriousness, in which he was giving to
his son precepts of life drawn from philosophy, says, “Who can be
ignorant that the power of fortune is great on either side? For both
when we meet with a prosperous breeze from her we gain the issues which
we desire, and when she has breathed contrary to us we are dashed on the
rocks.” <span id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) First of all, he who
says that nothing can be known, spoke this as though he himself and all
men had knowledge. Then he who endeavours to render doubtful even the
things which are plain, thought that this was plain, which ought to have
been to him especially doubtful; for to a wise man it is altogether
false. Who, he says, knows not? I indeed know not. Let him teach me, if
he can, what that power is, what that breeze, and what the contrary
breath.  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p3"></span>It is disgraceful, therefore, for a
man of talent to say that, which if you were to deny it, he would be
unable to prove. Lastly, he who says that the assent must be withheld
because it is the part of a foolish man rashly to assent to things which
are unknown to him, he, I say, altogether believed the opinions of the
vulgar and uninstructed, who think that it is fortune which gives to men
good and evil things. For they represent her image with the horn of
plenty and with a rudder, as though she both gave wealth and had the
government of human affairs. And to this opinion <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p3.1"></span>Virgil <span
id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) assented, who calls fortune
omnipotent; and the historian <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md)
who says, But assuredly fortune bears sway in everything. What place,
then, remains for the other gods? Why is she not said to reign by
herself, if she has more power than others; or why is she not alone
worshipped, if she has power in all things? Or if she inflicts evils
only, let them bring forward some cause why, if she is a goddess, she
envies men, and desires their destruction, though she is religiously
worshipped by them; why she is more favourable to the wicked and more
unfavourable to the good; why she plots, afflicts, deceives,
exterminates; who appointed her as the perpetual harasser of the race of
men; why, in short, she has obtained so mischievous a power, that she
renders all things illustrious or obscure according to her caprice
rather than in accordance with the truth. Philosophers, I say, ought
rather to have inquired into these things, than rashly to have accused
fortune, who is innocent: for although she has some existence, yet no
reason can be brought forward by them why she should be as hostile to
men as she is supposed to be. Therefore all those speeches in which they
rail at the injustice of fortune, and in opposition to fortune
arrogantly boast of their own virtues, are nothing else but the ravings
of thoughtless levity.  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p6"></span>Wherefore let them not envy us, to
whom God has revealed the truth: who, as we know that fortune is
nothing, so also know that there is a wicked and crafty spirit who is
unfriendly to the good, and the enemy of righteousness, who acts in
opposition to God; the cause of whose enmity we have explained in the
second book. <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) He therefore lays
plots against all; but those who are ignorant of God he hinders by
error, he overwhelms with folly, he overspreads with darkness, that no
one may be able to attain to the knowledge of the divine name, in which
alone are contained both wisdom and everlasting life. Those, on the
other hand, who know God, he assails with wiles and craft, that he may
ensnare them with desire and lust, and when they are corrupted by the
blandishments of sin, may impel them to death; or, if he shall have not
succeeded by stratagem, he attempts to cast them down by force and
violence. For on this account he was not at once thrust down by God to
punishment at the original transgression, that by his malice he may
exercise man to virtue: for unless this is in constant agitation, unless
it is strengthened by continual harassing, it cannot be perfect,
inasmuch as virtue is dauntless and unconquered patience in enduring
evils. From which it comes to pass that there is no virtue if an
adversary is wanting. When, therefore, they perceived the force of this
perverse power opposed to virtue, and were ignorant of its name, they
invented for themselves the senseless name of fortune; and how far this
is removed from wisdom, <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p7.1"></span>Juvenal
declares in these verses: <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p8.4"></span> “No divine power is absent if
> there is prudence; but we make you a goddess, O Fortune, and place you
> in heaven.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p9"></span>It was folly, therefore, and error,
and blindness, and, as <span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-p9.1"></span>Cicero
says, <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) ignorance of facts and
causes, which introduced the names of Nature and Fortune. But as they
are ignorant of their adversary, so also they do not indeed know virtue
the knowledge of which is derived from the idea of an adversary. And if
this is joined with wisdom, or, as they say, is itself also wisdom, they
must be ignorant in what subjects it is contained. For no one can
possibly be furnished with true arms if he is ignorant of the enemy
against whom he must be armed; nor can he overcome his adversary, who in
fighting does not attack his real enemy, but a shadow. For he will be
overthrown, who, having his attention <span id="page_100">p. 100</span>
<span id="iii.ii.iii.xxix-Page_100"></span>fixed on another object,
shall not previously have foreseen or guarded against the blow aimed at
his vitals.
