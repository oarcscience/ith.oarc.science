<span id="iii.ii.ii.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chap. iii.—that cicero and other men of learning erred in not turning away the people from error.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p1"></span>But what does it avail thus to
address the vulgar and ignorant, when we see that learned and prudent
men, though they understand the vanity of these ceremonies, nevertheless
through some perverseness persist in the worship of those very objects
which they condemn? <span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Cicero was well
aware that the deities which men worshipped were false. For when he had
spoken many things which tended to the overthrow of religious
ceremonies, he said nevertheless that these matters ought not to be
discussed by the vulgar, lest such discussion should extinguish the
system of religion which was publicly received. What can you do
respecting him, who, when he perceives himself to be in error, of his
own accord dashes himself against the stones, that all the people may
stumble? or tears out his own eyes, that all may be blind? who neither
deserves well of others, whom he suffers to be in error, nor of himself,
since he inclines to the errors of others, and makes no use of the
benefit of his own wisdom, so as to carry out <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) in action the conception of his own
mind, but knowingly and consciously thrusts his foot into the snare,
that he also may be taken with the rest, whom he ought, as the more
prudent, to have extricated? Nay rather, if you have any virtue, <span
id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>Cicero, endeavour to make the people
wise: that is a befitting subject, on which you may expend all the
powers of your eloquence. For there is no fear lest speech should fail
you in so good a cause, when you have often defended even bad ones with
copiousness and spirit. But truly you fear the prison of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p2.2"></span>Socrates, <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) and on that account you do not venture
to undertake the advocacy of truth. But, as a wise man, you ought to
have despised death. And, indeed, it would have been much more glorious
to die on account of good words than on account of revilings. Nor would
the renown of your Philippics have been more advantageous to you than
the dispersion of the errors of mankind, and the recalling of the minds
of men to a healthy state by your disputation.  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p4"></span>But let us make allowance for
timidity, which ought not to exist in a wise man. Why, then, are you
yourself engaged in the same error? I see that you worship things of
earth made by the hand: you understand that they are vain, and yet you
do the same things which they do, whom you confess to be most foolish.
What, therefore, did it profit you, that you saw the truth, which you
were neither about to defend nor to follow? If even they who perceive
themselves to be in error err willingly, how much more so do the
unlearned vulgar, who delight in empty processions, and gaze at all
things with boyish minds! They are delighted with trifling things, and
are captivated with the form of images; and they are unable to weigh
every object in their own minds, so as to understand that nothing which
is beheld by the eyes of mortals ought to be worshipped, because it must
necessarily be mortal. Nor is it matter of surprise if they do not see
God, when they themselves do not even see man, whom they believe that
they see. For this, which falls under the notice of the eyes, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) is not man, but the receptacle of man,
the quality and figure of which are not seen from the lineaments of the
vessel which contains them, but from the actions and character. They,
therefore, who worship images are <span
id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p5.4"></span>mere bodies without men, because they
have given themselves to corporeal things, and do not see anything with
the mind more than with the body; whereas it is the office of the soul
to perceive those things more clearly which the eye of the body cannot
behold. And that philosopher and poet severely accuses those men as
humble and abject, who, in opposition to the design of their nature,
prostrate themselves <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="iii.ii.ii.iii-Page_44"></span>to the worship of earthly things; for
he says: <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p6.3"></span> “And they abase their souls with
> fear of the gods, and weigh and press them down to earth.”  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p7"></span>When he said these things, indeed,
his meaning was different—that nothing was to be worshipped, because the
gods do not regard the affairs of men.  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p8"></span>In another place, at length, he
acknowledges that the ceremonies and worship of the gods is an
unavailing office: <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p9.2"></span> “Nor is it any piety to be often
> seen with veiled head to turn to a stone, and approach every altar,
> and fall prostrate on the ground, and spread the hands before the
> shrines of the gods, and sprinkle the altars with much blood of
> beasts, and to offer vow after vow.”  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p10"></span>And assuredly if these things are
useless, it is not right that sublime and lofty souls should be called
away and depressed to the earth, but that they should think only of
heavenly things.  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p11"></span>False religious systems, therefore,
have been attacked by more sagacious men, because they perceived their
falsehood; but the true <span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p11.1"></span>religion
was not introduced, because they knew not what and where it was. They
therefore so regarded it as though it had no existence, because they
were unable to find it in its truth. And in this manner they fell into a
much greater error than they who held a religion which was false. For
those worshippers of fragile images, however foolish they may be,
inasmuch as they place heavenly things in things which are earthly and
corruptible, yet retain something of wisdom, and may be pardoned,
because they hold the chief duty of man, if not in reality, yet still in
their purpose; since, if not the only, yet certainly the greatest
difference between men and the beasts consists in religion. But this
latter class, in proportion to their superior wisdom, in that they
understood the error of false religion, rendered themselves so much the
more foolish, because they did not imagine that some religion was true.
And thus, because it is easier to judge of the affairs of others than of
their own, while they see the downfall of others, they have not observed
what was before their own feet. On either side is found the greatest
folly, and a certain trace <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) of
wisdom; so that you may doubt which are rather to be called more
foolish—those who embrace a false religion, or those who embrace none.
But (as I have said) pardon may be granted to those who are ignorant and
do not own themselves to be wise; but it cannot be extended to those
who, while they profess <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) wisdom,
rather exhibit folly. I am not, indeed, so unjust as to imagine that
they could divine, so that they might find out the truth by themselves;
for I acknowledge that this is impossible. But I require from them that
which they were able to perform by reason <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) itself. For they would act more
prudently, if they both understood that some <span
id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p14.2"></span>form of religion is true, and if, while
they attacked false <span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p14.3"></span>religions,
they openly proclaimed that men were not in possession of that which is
true.  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p15"></span>But this consideration may perhaps
have influenced them, that if there were any true religion, it would
exert itself and assert its authority, and not permit the existence of
anything opposed to it. For they were unable to see at all, on what
account, or by whom, and in what manner true religion was depressed,
which partakes of a divine mystery <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) and a heavenly secret. And no man can
know <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) this by any means, unless
he is taught. The sum of the matter is this: The unlearned and the
foolish esteem false religions as true, because they neither know the
true nor understand the false. <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md)
But the more sagacious, because they are ignorant of the true, either
persist in those religions which they know to be false, that they may
appear to possess something; or worship nothing at all, that they may
not fall into error, whereas this very thing partakes largely of error,
under the figure of a man to imitate the life of cattle. To understand
that which is false is truly the part of wisdom, but of human wisdom.
Beyond this step man cannot proceed, and thus many of the philosophers
have taken away religious institutions, as I have pointed out; but to
know the truth is the part of divine wisdom. But man by himself cannot
attain to this knowledge, unless he is taught by God. Thus philosophers
have reached the height of human wisdom, so as to understand that which
is not; but they have failed in attaining the power of saying that which
really is. It is a well-known saying of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.iii-p18.1"></span>Cicero: <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) “I wish that I could as easily find
out the truth as I can refute false things.” And because this is beyond
the power of man’s condition, the capability of this office is assigned
to us, to whom God has delivered the knowledge of the truth; to the
explaining of which the four last books shall be devoted. Now, in the
meantime, let us bring to light false things, as we have begun to do.
