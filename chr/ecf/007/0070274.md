#### <span id="iii.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XI.—Of God, and that the One God, and by Whose Providence the World is Governed and Exists.

<span id="iii.iii.xi-p1"></span>Since it is agreed upon concerning
providence, it follows that we show whether it is to be believed that it
belongs to many, or rather to one only. We have sufficiently taught, as
I think, in our <span id="iii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Institutions, that
there cannot be many gods; because, if the divine energy and power be
distributed among several, it must necessarily be diminished. But that
which is lessened is plainly mortal; but if He is not mortal, He can
neither be lessened nor divided. Therefore there is but one God, in whom
complete energy and power can neither be lessened nor increased. But if
there are many, while they separately have something of power and
authority, the sum itself decreases; nor will they separately be able to
have the whole, which they have in common with others: so much will be
wanting to each as the others shall possess. There cannot therefore be
many rulers in this world, nor many masters in one house, nor many
pilots in one ship, nor many leaders in one herd or flock, nor many
queens in one swarm. But there could not have been many suns in heaven,
as there are not several souls in one body; so entirely does the whole
of nature agree in unity. But if the world  

> <span id="iii.iii.xi-p1.2"></span> “Is nourished by a soul,  
> A spirit whose celestial flame  
> Glows in each member of the frame,  
> And stirs the mighty whole,” <span
> id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702)  

<span id="iii.iii.xi-p3"></span>it is evident from the testimony of the
poet, that there is one God who inhabits the world, since the whole body
cannot be inhabited and governed except by one mind. Therefore all
divine power must be in one person, by whose will and command all things
are ruled; and therefore He is so great, that He cannot be described in
words by man, or estimated by the senses. From what source, therefore,
did the opinion or persuasion <span id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703)
respecting many gods come to men? Without doubt, all those who are
worshipped as gods were men, and were also the earliest and greatest
kings; but who is ignorant that they were invested with divine honours
after death, either on account of the virtue by which they had profited
the race of men, or that they obtained immortal memory on account of the
benefits and inventions by which they had adorned human life? And not
only men, but women also. And this, both the most ancient writers of
Greece, whom they call <span id="iii.iii.xi-p4.3"></span>theologi; <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704) and also Roman writers following
and imitating the <span id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span
id="iii.iii.xi-Page_269"></span>Greeks, teach; of whom especially <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p5.2"></span>Euhemerus and our <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p5.3"></span>Ennius, who point out the birthdays,
marriages, offspring, governments, exploits, deaths, and tombs <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705) of all of them. And <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p6.3"></span>Tullius, following them, in his third book,
<span id="iii.iii.xi-p6.4"></span>On the Nature of the Gods, destroyed
the public religions; but neither he himself nor any other person was
able to introduce the true one, of which he was ignorant. And thus he
himself testified that that which was false was evident; that the truth,
however, lay concealed. “Would to heaven,” he says, “that I could as
easily discover true things as refute those that are false!” <span
id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706) And this he proclaimed not with
dissimulation as an Academic, but truly and in accordance with the
feeling of his mind, because the truth cannot be uprooted from human
perceptions: that which the foresight of man was able to attain to, he
attained to, that he might expose false things. For whatever is
fictitious and false, because it is supported by no reason, is easily
destroyed. There is therefore one God, the source and origin of all
things, as <span id="iii.iii.xi-p7.4"></span>Plato both felt and taught
in the <span id="iii.iii.xi-p7.5"></span>Timœus, whose majesty he
declares to be so great, that it can neither be comprehended by the mind
nor be expressed by the tongue.  

<span id="iii.iii.xi-p8"></span><span id="iii.iii.xi-p8.1"></span>Hermes
bears the same testimony, whom <span id="iii.iii.xi-p8.2"></span>Cicero
asserts <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707) to be reckoned by the
Egyptians among the number of the gods. I speak of him who, on account
of his excellence and knowledge of many arts, was called <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p9.2"></span>Trismegistus; and he was far more ancient
not only than <span id="iii.iii.xi-p9.3"></span>Plato, but than <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p9.4"></span>Pythagoras, and those seven wise men. <span
id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708) In <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p10.3"></span>Xenophon, <span
id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709) <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p11.2"></span>Socrates, as he discourses, says that “the
form of God ought not to be inquired about: “and <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p11.3"></span>Plato, in his <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p11.4"></span>Book of Laws, <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710) says: “What God is, ought not to be
the subject of inquiry, because it can neither be found out nor
related.” <span id="iii.iii.xi-p12.1"></span>Pythagoras also admits that
there is but one God, saying that there is an incorporeal mind, which,
being diffused and stretched through all nature, gives vital perception
to all living creatures; but Antisthenes, in his <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p12.2"></span>Physics, said that there was but one
natural God, although the nations and cities have gods of their own
people. <span id="iii.iii.xi-p12.3"></span>Aristotle, with his followers
the Peripatetics, and <span id="iii.iii.xi-p12.4"></span>Zeno with his
followers the Stoics, say nearly the same things. Truly it would be a
long task to follow up the opinions of all separately, who, although
they used different names, nevertheless agreed in one power which
governed the world. But, however, though philosophers and poets, and
those, in short, who worship the gods, often acknowledge the Supreme
God, yet no one ever inquired into, no one discussed, the subject of His
worship and honours; with that persuasion, in truth, with which, always
believing Him to be bounteous and incorruptible, they think <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711) that He is neither angry with any
one, nor stands in need of any worship. Thus there can be no religion
where there is no fear. <span id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712)
