<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p1"></span><span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-Page_108"></span>  

#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chap. X.—Of the Advent of Jesus; Of the Fortunes of the Jews, and Their Government, Until the Passion of the Lord.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p2"></span>In the first place, then, men ought to
know that the arrangements of the Most High God have so advanced from
the beginning, that it was necessary, as the end of the world <span
id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554) approached, that the Son of God should
descend to the earth, that He might build a temple for God, and teach
righteousness; but, however, not with the might of an angel or with
heavenly power, but in the form of man and in the condition of a mortal,
that when He had discharged the office of His ministry, <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555) He might be delivered into the hands
of wicked men, and might undergo death, that, having subdued this also
by His might, He might rise again, and bring to man, whose nature He had
put on <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556) and represented, the hope
of overcoming death, and might admit him to the rewards of immortality.
And that no one may be ignorant of this arrangement, we will show that
all things were foretold which we see fulfilled in Christ. Let no one
believe our assertion unless I shall show that the prophets before a
long series of ages published that it should come to pass at length that
the Son of God should be born as a man, and perform wonderful deeds, and
sow <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557) the worship of God
throughout the whole earth, and at last be crucified, and on the third
day rise again. And when I shall have proved all these things by the
writings of those very men who treated with violence their God who had
assumed a mortal body, what else will prevent it from being manifest
that true wisdom is conversant with this religion only? Now the origin
of the whole mystery is to be related.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p7"></span>Our ancestors, <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558) who were chiefs of the Hebrews, when
they were distressed by famine and want, passed over into Egypt, that
they might obtain a supply of corn; and sojourning there a long time,
they were oppressed with an intolerable yoke of slavery. Then God pitied
them, and led them out, and freed them from the hand of the king of the
Egyptians, after <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p8.1"></span>four hundred and
thirty <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559) years, under the
leadership of <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p9.1"></span>Moses, through whom the
law was afterwards given to them by God; and in this leading out God
displayed the power of His majesty. For He made His people to pass
through the midst of the Red Sea, His angel <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560) going before and dividing the water,
so that the people might walk over the dry land, of whom it might more
truly be said (as the poet says <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561)
), that “the wave, closing over him after the appearance of a mountain,
stood around him.” And when he heard of this, the tyrant of the
Egyptians followed with this great host of his men, and rashly entering
the sea which still lay open, was destroyed, together with his whole
army, by the waves returning <span id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562) to
their place. But the Hebrews, when they had entered into the wilderness,
saw many wonderful deeds. For when they suffered thirst, a rock having
been struck with a rod, a fountain of water sprung forth and refreshed
the people. And again, when they were hungry, a shower <span
id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563) of heavenly nourishment descended.
Moreover, also, the wind <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564) brought
quails into their camp, so that they were not only satisfied with
heavenly bread, but also with more choice banquets. And yet, in return
for these divine benefits, they did not pay honour to God; but when
slavery had been now removed from them, and their thirst and hunger laid
aside, they fell away into luxury, and transferred their minds to the
profane rites of the Egyptians. For when <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p14.2"></span>Moses, their leader, had ascended into the
mountain, and there tarried forty days, they made the head <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565) of an ox in gold, which they call
Apis, <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566) that it might go before
them as a standard. <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567) With which
sin and crime God was offended, and justly visited the impious and
ungrateful people with severe punishments, and made them subject to the
law <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568) which He had given by <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p18.7"></span>Moses.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p19"></span>But afterwards, when they had settled
in a desert part of Syria, the Hebrews <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569) lost their ancient name; and since the
leader of their host <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570) was <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p21.2"></span>Judas, they were called Jews, <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571) and the land which they inhabited
Judæa. And at <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-Page_109"></span>first, indeed, they were not subject to
the dominion of Kings, but civil Judges presided over the people and the
law: they were not, however, appointed only for a year, as the Roman
consuls, but supported by a perpetual jurisdiction. Then, the name of
Judges being taken away, the kingly power was introduced. But during the
government of the Judges the people had often undertaken corrupt
religious rites; and God, offended by them, as often brought them into
bondage to strangers, until again, softened by the repentance of the
people, He freed them from bondage. Likewise under the Kings, being
oppressed by wars with their neighbours on account of their iniquities,
and at last taken captive and led to Babylon, they suffered punishment
for their impiety by oppressive slavery, until <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p22.1"></span>Cyrus came to the kingdom, who immediately
restored the Jews by an edict. Afterwards they had tetrarchs until the
time of <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p22.2"></span>Herod, who was in the reign
of <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p22.3"></span>Tiberius Cæsar; in whose
fifteenth year, in the consulship of the two Gemini, on the 23d of
March, <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572) the Jews crucified
Christ. This series of events, this order, is contained in the secrets
of the sacred writings. But I will first show for what reason Christ
came to the earth, that the foundation and the system of divine religion
may be manifest.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p8"></span> The patriarchs. The idea appears to be
that Christians from the Gentiles, having succeeded to the privileges of
the Jews, are, as it were, their posterity.  

<span id="fn_559"></span>[108:560](0070092.htm#fr_559) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p9"></span> The duration of the captivity in Egypt
was two hundred and fifteen years. The period of four hundred and thirty
years is reckoned from the call of Abram out of Ur of the Chaldees to
the final departure from Egypt.  

<span id="fn_560"></span>[108:561](0070092.htm#fr_560) <span

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p10"></span> The Angel of the Covenant, who so
often presented Himself to the Hebrews. See [Ex. xxiii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020)<span

id="iii.ii.iv.x-p11.1"></span>Virgil, <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p11.2"></span>Georg., iv. 361. He describes <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p11.3"></span>Aristæus as descending to the chamber of
his mother <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p11.4"></span>Cyrene, in the depths of
the river Peneus. The waters separate on each side to make a way for
him, and then close over his head.

id="iii.ii.iv.x-p14.3"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p15"></span> Some of the Fathers think, with <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p15.1"></span>Lacantius, that it was the head only, and
not the whole figure, of a calf which they made.  

<span id="fn_566"></span>[108:567](0070092.htm#fr_566) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p15.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p16"></span> Apis is the name given by the
Egyptians to the calf which they worshipped.  

<span id="fn_567"></span>[108:568](0070092.htm#fr_567) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p16.1"></span>

<span id="fn_568"></span>[108:569](0070092.htm#fr_568) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p17.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p18"></span> The moral law had been already given
to <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p18.1"></span>Moses on the mount before the
making of the golden calf. The law here referred to may well be taken to
express the burthensome routine of the ceremonial law, which <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p18.2"></span>Peter ([Acts xv.
10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010)<span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p18.3"></span>) describes as a “yoke which neither their
fathers nor they were able to bear.” \[Our author expresses himself with
accuracy: He <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p18.4"></span>subjected them by the
oppressive <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p18.5"></span>ceremonial law to the
<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p18.6"></span>moral law He had just given.\]  

<span id="fn_569"></span>[108:570](0070092.htm#fr_569) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p20"></span> The Hebrews are said to have derived
their name from Heber the descendant of Noah by Shem; or more probably
from Abram the Hebrew, that is, the man who had crossed the river,—a
name given to him by the Canaanites. See [Gen. xiv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#013)<span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p20.1"></span>.  

<span id="fn_570"></span>[108:571](0070092.htm#fr_570) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p20.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p21"></span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p21.1"></span>Examinis.  

<span id="fn_571"></span>[108:572](0070092.htm#fr_571) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p21.3"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p22"></span> There seems to be no authority for
this derivation of the name. They were doubtless called Jews from Judah.
As those who returned from the captivity at Babylon were principally of
the tribe of Judah, though some from the other tribes returned with
them, they were called Jews after the captivity.  

<span id="fn_572"></span>[109:573](0070092.htm#fr_572) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p22.4"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p23"></span> There appears to be no reasonable
doubt that the day on which our Lord suffered was the 14th of Nisan,
that is, April 7. See <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p23.1"></span>Gresswell’s
<span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p23.2"></span>Dissertations, vol. iii. p. 168;
also <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p23.3"></span>Ellicott’s <span
id="iii.ii.iv.x-p23.4"></span>Lectures on the Life of Christ \[Gresswell
is not to be too readily accepted in this. See the learned inquiry of
Dr. <span id="iii.ii.iv.x-p23.5"></span>Jarvis, of whom, vol. ii. p.
477.\]
