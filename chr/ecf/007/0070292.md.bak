#### <span id="iii.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Chap. V.—Of the Figures and Limbs of Animals.

<span id="iii.iv.v-p1"></span>In the beginning, when God was forming the
animals, He did not wish to conglobate <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828.md) and collect them into a round
shape, that they might be able easily to put themselves in motion for
walking, and to turn themselves in any direction; but from the highest
part of the body He lengthened out the head. He also carried out to a
greater length some of the limbs, which are called feet, that, being
fixed on the ground with alternate motions, they might lead forward the
animal wherever his inclination had borne him, or the necessity of
seeking food had called him. Moreover, He made four limbs standing out
from the very vessel of the body: two behind, which are in all
animals—the feet; also two close to the head and neck, which supply
various uses to animals. For in cattle and wild beasts they are feet
like the hinder ones; but in man they are hands, which are produced not
for walking, but for acting and controlling. <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829.md) There is also a third class, in
which those former limbs are neither feet nor hands; but wings, which,
having feathers arranged in order, supply the use of flying. <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830.md) Thus one formation has different
forms and uses; and that He might firmly hold together the density
itself of the body, by binding together greater and small bones, He
compacted a kind of keel, which we call the spine; and He did not think
fit to form it of one continued bone, lest the animal should not have
the power of walking and bending itself. From its middle part, as it
were, He has extended in a different direction transverse and flat
bones, by which, being slightly curved, and almost drawn together to
themselves as into a circle, the inward organs <span
id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831.md) may be covered, that those parts
which needed to be soft and less strong might be protected by the
encircling of a solid framework. <span
id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832.md) But at the end of that joining
together which we have said to resemble the keel of a ship, He placed
the head, in which might be the government of the whole living creature;
and this name was given to it, as indeed <span
id="iii.iv.v-p6.2"></span>Varro writes to <span
id="iii.iv.v-p6.3"></span>Cicero, because from this the senses and the
nerves take their beginning.  

<span id="iii.iv.v-p7"></span>But those parts, which we have said to be
lengthened out from the body, either for the sake of walking, or of
acting, or of flying, He would have to consist of bones, neither too
long, for the sake of rapidity of motion, nor too short, for the sake of
firmness, but of a few, and those large. For either they are two as in
man, or four as in a quadruped. And these He did not make solid, lest in
walking sluggishness and weight should retard; but He made them hollow,
and full of marrow within, to preserve the vigour of the body. And
again, He did not make them equally extended to the end; but He
conglobated their extremities with coarse knots, that they might be able
more easily to be bound with sinews, and to be turned more easily, from
which they are called joints. <span id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md)
These knots He made firmly solid, and covered with a soft kind of
covering, which is called cartilage; for this purpose, that they might
be bent without galling or any sense of pain. He did not, however, form
these after one fashion. For He made some simple and round into an orb,
in those joints at least in which it was befitting that the limbs should
move in all directions, as in the shoulders, since it is necessary that
the hands should move and be twisted about in any direction; but others
He made broad, and equal, and round towards one part, and that plainly
in those places where only it was necessary for the limbs to be bent, as
in the knees, and in the elbows, and in the hands themselves. For as it
was at the same time pleasant to the sight, and useful, that the hands
should move in every direction from that position from which they
spring; so assuredly, if this same thing should happen to the elbows, a
motion of that kind would be at once superfluous and unbecoming. For
then the hand, having lost the dignity which it now has, through its
excessive flexibility, <span id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) would
appear like the trunk of an elephant; and man would be altogether
snake-handed, <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) —an instance of
which has been wonderfully effected in that monstrous beast. For God,
who wished to display His providence and power by a wonderful variety of
many things, inasmuch as He had not extended the head of that animal to
such a length that he might be able to touch the earth with his mouth,
which would have been horrible and hideous, and because He had so armed
the mouth itself with extended tusks, that even if he touched the earth
the tusks would still deprive him of the power of feeding, He lengthened
out <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span
id="iii.iv.v-Page_287"></span>between these from the top of the forehead
a soft and flexible limb, by which he might be able to grasp and lay
hold of anything, lest the prominent magnitude of the tusks, or the
shortness of the neck, should interfere with the arrangement for taking
food.
