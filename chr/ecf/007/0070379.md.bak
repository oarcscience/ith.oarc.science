<span id="vi.ii.iv"></span>

#### <span id="vi.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>from the fourth chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>1. “After
this, I beheld, and, lo, a door was opened in heaven.”\] The new
testament is announced as an open door in heaven.  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p2"></span>“And the first voice which I heard <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>was, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me,
saying, Come up hither.”\] Since the door is shown to be opened, it is
manifest that previously it had been closed to men. And it was
sufficiently and fully laid open when Christ ascended with His body to
the Father into heaven. Moreover, the first <span id="page_348">p.
348</span> <span id="vi.ii.iv-Page_348"></span>voice which he had heard
when he says that it spoke with him, without contradiction condemns
those who say that one spoke in the prophets, another in the Gospel;
since it is rather He Himself who comes, that is the same who spoke in
the prophets. For <span id="vi.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>John was of the
circumcision, and all that people which had heard the announcement of
the Old Testament was edified with his word.  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p3"></span>“That very same voice,” said he, “that I
had heard, that said unto me, Come up hither.”\] That is the Spirit,
whom a little before he confesses that he had seen walking as the Son of
man in the midst of the golden candlesticks. And he now gathers from Him
what had been foretold in similitudes by the law, and associates with
this scripture all the former prophets, and opens up the Scriptures. And
because our Lord invited in His own name all believers into heaven, He
forthwith poured out the Holy Spirit, who should bring them to heaven.
He says:—  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p4"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p4.1"></span>2.
“Immediately I was in the Spirit.”\] And since the mind of the faithful
is opened by the Holy Spirit, and that is manifested to them which was
also foretold to the fathers, he distinctly says:—  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p5"></span>“And, behold, a throne was set in
heaven.”\] The throne set: what is it but the throne of judgment and of
the King?  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p6"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p6.1"></span>3. “And He
that sat upon the throne was, to look upon, like a jasper and a sardine
stone.”\] Upon the throne he says that he saw the likeness of a jasper
and a sardine stone. The jasper is of the colour of water, the sardine
of fire. These two are thence manifested to be placed as judgments upon
God’s tribunal until the consummation of the world, of which judgments
one is already completed in the deluge of water, and the other shall be
completed by fire.  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p7"></span>“And there was a rainbow about the
throne.”\] Moreover, the rainbow round about the throne has the same
colours. The rainbow is called a bow from what the Lord spake to Noah
and to his sons, <span id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263.md) that they
should not fear any further deluge in the generation of God, but fire.
For thus He says: I will place my bow in the clouds, that ye may now no
longer fear water, but fire.  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p9"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p9.1"></span>6. “And
before the throne there was, as it were, a sea of glass like to
crystal.”\] That is the gift of baptism which He sheds forth through His
Son in time of repentance, before He executes judgment. It is therefore
before the throne, that is, the judgment. And when he says a sea of
glass like to crystal, he shows that it is pure water, smooth, not
agitated by the wind, not flowing down as on a slope, but given to be
immoveable as the house of God.  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p10"></span>“And round about the throne were four
living creatures.”\] The four living creatures are the four Gospels.  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p11"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p11.1"></span>7–10.
“The first living creature was like to a lion, and the second was like
to a calf, and the third had a face like to a man, and the fourth was
like to a flying eagle; and they had six wings, and round about and
within they were full of eyes; and they had no rest, saying, Holy, holy,
holy, Lord Omnipotent. And the four and twenty elders, falling down
before the throne, adored God.”\] The four and twenty elders are the
twenty-four books of the prophets and of the law, which give testimonies
of the judgment. Moreover, also, they are the twenty-four fathers—twelve
apostles and twelve patriarchs. And in that the living creatures are
different in appearance, this is the reason: the living creature like to
a lion designates <span id="vi.ii.iv-p11.2"></span>Mark, in whom is
heard the voice of the lion roaring in the desert. And in the figure of
a man, <span id="vi.ii.iv-p11.3"></span>Matthew strives to declare to us
the genealogy of <span id="vi.ii.iv-p11.4"></span>Mary, from whom Christ
took flesh. Therefore, in enumerating from <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p11.5"></span>Abraham to <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p11.6"></span>David, and thence to <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p11.7"></span>Joseph, he spoke of Him as if of a man:
therefore his announcement sets forth the image of a man. <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p11.8"></span>Luke, in narrating the priesthood of <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p11.9"></span>Zacharias as he offers a sacrifice for the
people, and the angel that appears to him with respect of the
priesthood, and the victim in the same description bore the likeness of
a calf. <span id="vi.ii.iv-p11.10"></span>John the evangelist, like to
an eagle hastening on uplifted wings to greater heights, argues about
the Word of God. <span id="vi.ii.iv-p11.11"></span>Mark, therefore, as
an evangelist thus beginning, “The beginning of the Gospel of <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p11.12"></span>Jesus Christ, as it is written in <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p11.13"></span>Isaiah the prophet;” <span
id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264.md) The voice of one crying in the
wilderness,” <span id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md) —has the effigy
of a lion. And <span id="vi.ii.iv-p13.2"></span>Matthew, “The book of
the generation of <span id="vi.ii.iv-p13.3"></span>Jesus Christ, the son
of <span id="vi.ii.iv-p13.4"></span>David, the son of <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p13.5"></span>Abraham:” <span
id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266.md) this is the form of a man. But
<span id="vi.ii.iv-p14.2"></span>Luke said, “There was a priest, by name
<span id="vi.ii.iv-p14.3"></span>Zachariah, of the course of <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p14.4"></span>Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of
<span id="vi.ii.iv-p14.5"></span>Aaron:” <span
id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267.md) this is the likeness of a calf. But
<span id="vi.ii.iv-p15.2"></span>John, when he begins, “In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268.md) sets forth the likeness of a flying
eagle. Moreover, not only do the evangelists express their four
similitudes in their <span id="vi.ii.iv-p16.2"></span>respective
openings of the Gospels, but also the Word itself of God the Father
Omnipotent, which is His Son our Lord <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p16.3"></span>Jesus Christ, bears the same likeness in the
time of His advent. When He preaches to us, He is, as it were, a lion
and a lion’s whelp. And when for man’s salvation He was made man to
overcome death, and to set all men free, and that He offered <span
id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span id="vi.ii.iv-Page_349"></span>Himself
a victim to the Father on our behalf, He was called a calf. And that He
overcame death and ascended into the heavens, extending His wings and
protecting His people, He was named a flying eagle. Therefore these
announcements, although they are four, yet are one, because it proceeded
from one mouth. Even as the river in paradise, although it is one, was
divided into four heads. Moreover, that for the announcement of the New
Testament those living creatures had eyes within and without, shows the
spiritual providence which both looks into the secrets of the heart, and
beholds the things which are coming after that are within and without.  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p17"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p17.1"></span>8. “Six
wings.”\] These are the testimonies of the books of the Old Testament.
Thus, twenty and four make as many as there are elders sitting upon the
thrones. But as an animal cannot fly unless it have wings, so, too, the
announcement of the New Testament gains no faith unless it have the
fore-announced testimonies of the Old Testament, by which it is lifted
from the earth, and flies. For in every case, what has been told before,
and is afterwards found to have happened, that begets an undoubting
faith. Again, also, if wings be not attached to the living creatures,
they have nothing whence they may draw their life. For unless what the
prophets foretold had been consummated in Christ, their preaching was
vain. For the Catholic Church holds those things which were both before
predicted and afterwards accomplished. And it flies, because the living
animal is reasonably lifted up from the earth. But to heretics who do
not avail themselves of the prophetic testimony, to them also there are
present living creatures; but they do not fly, because they are of the
earth. And to the Jews who do <span id="vi.ii.iv-p17.2"></span>not
receive the announcement of the New Testament there are present wings;
but they do not fly, that is, they bring a vain prophesying to men, not
adjusting facts to their words. And the books of the Old Testament that
are received are twenty-four, which you will find in the epitomes of
<span id="vi.ii.iv-p17.3"></span>Theodore. But, moreover (as we have
said), four and twenty elders, patriarchs and apostles, are to judge His
people. For to the apostles, when they asked, saying, “We have forsaken
all that we had, and followed Thee: what shall we have?” our Lord
replied, “When the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye
also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.” <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269.md) But of the fathers
also who should judge, says the patriarch <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p18.2"></span>Jacob, “<span id="vi.ii.iv-p18.3"></span>Dan
also himself shall judge his people among his brethren, even as one of
the tribes in Israel.” <span id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p20"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p20.1"></span>5. “And
from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and
seven torches of fire burning.”\] And the lightnings, and voices, and
thunders proceeding from the throne of God, and the seven torches of
fire burning, signify announcements, and promises of adoption, and
threatenings. For lightnings signify the Lord’s advent, and the voices
the announcements of the New Testament, and the thunders, that the words
are from heaven. The burning torches of fire <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p20.2"></span>signify the gift of the Holy Spirit, that it
is given by the wood of the passion. And when these things were doing,
he says that all the elders fell down and adored the Lord; while the
living creatures—that is, of course, the actions recorded in the Gospels
and the teaching of the Lord—gave Him glory and honour. <span
id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271.md) In that they had fulfilled the word
that had been previously foretold by them, they worthily and with reason
exult, feeling that they have ministered the mysteries and the word of
the Lord. Finally, also, because He had come who should remove death,
and who alone was worthy to take the crown of immortality, all for the
glory of His most excellent doing had crowns.  

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p22"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p22.1"></span>10. “And
they cast their crowns under His feet.”\] That is, on account of the
eminent glory of Christ’s victory, they cast all their victories under
His feet. This is what in the Gospel the Holy Spirit consummated by
showing, For when about finally to suffer, our Lord had come to
Jerusalem, and the people had gone forth to meet Him, some strewed the
road with palm branches cut down, others threw down their garments,
doubtless these were setting forth two peoples—the one of the
patriarchs, the other of the prophets; that is to say, of the great men
who had any kind of palms of their victories against sin, and cast them
under the feet of Christ, the victor of all. And the palm and the crown
signify the same things, and these are not given save to the victor.
