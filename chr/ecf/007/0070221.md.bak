#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXIII.—What is the Chief Good to Be Sought in Life.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p1"></span>What is the chief good must be an
object of inquiry, that our whole life and actions may be directed to
it. When inquiry is made respecting the chief good of man, it ought to
be settled to be of such a kind, first, that it have reference to man
alone; in the next place, that it belong peculiarly to the mind; lastly,
that it be sought by virtue. Let us see, therefore, whether the chief
good which the philosophers mark out be such that it has reference
neither to a dumb animal nor to the body, and cannot be attained without
virtue.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p2"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p2.1"></span>Aristippus, the founder of the
Cyrenaic sect, who thought that bodily pleasure was the chief good,
ought to be removed from the number of philosophers, and from the
society of men, because he compared himself to a beast. The chief good
of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p2.2"></span>Hieronymus is to be without
pain, that of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p2.3"></span>Diodorus to cease
to be in pain. But the other animals avoid pain; and when they are
without pain, or cease to be in pain, are glad. What distinction, then,
will be given to man, if his chief good is judged to be common with the
beasts? <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p2.4"></span>Zeno thought that the
chief good was to live agreeably to nature. But this definition is a
general one. For all animals live agreeably to nature, and each has its
own nature.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p3"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p3.1"></span>Epicurus maintained that it was
pleasure of the soul. What is pleasure of the soul but joy, in which the
soul for the most part luxuriates, and unbends itself either to sport or
to laughter? But this good befalls even dumb animals, which, when they
are satisfied with pasture, relax themselves to joy and wantonness.
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p3.2"></span>Dinomachus and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p3.3"></span>Callipho approved of honourable
pleasure; but they either said the same that <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p3.4"></span>Epicurus did, that bodily pleasure is
dishonourable; or if they considered bodily pleasures to be partly base
and partly honourable, then that is not the chief good which is ascribed
to the body. The Peripatetics make up the chief good of goods of the
soul, and body, and fortune. The goods of the soul may be approved of;
but if they require assistance for the completion of happiness, they are
plainly weak. But the goods of the body and of fortune are not in the
power of man; nor is that now the chief good which is assigned to the
body, or to things placed without us, because this double good extends
even to the cattle, which have need of being well, and of a due supply
of food. The Stoics are believed to have entertained much better views,
who said that virtue was the chief good. But virtue cannot be the chief
good, since, if it is the endurance of evils and of labours, it is not
happy of itself; but it ought to effect and produce the chief good,
because it cannot be attained without the greatest difficulty and
labour. But, in truth, <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p3.5"></span>Aristotle
wandered far from reason, who connected honour with virtue, as though it
were possible for virtue at any time to be separated from honour, or to
be united with baseness.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p4"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-p4.1"></span>Herillus the Pyrrhonist made knowledge
the chief good. This indeed belongs to man, and to the soul only, but it
may happen to him without virtue. For he is not to be considered happy
who has either learnt anything by hearing, or has gained the knowledge
of it by a little reading; nor is it a definition of the chief good,
because there may be a knowledge either of bad things, or at any rate of
things that are useless. And if it is the knowledge of good and useful
things which you have acquired by labour, nevertheless it is not the
chief good, because knowledge is <span id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxix-Page_235"></span>not sought on its own account, but
on account of something else. For the arts are learnt on this account,
that they may be to us the means of gaining support, or a source of
glory, or even of pleasure; and it is plain that these things cannot be
the chief goods. Therefore the philosophers do not observe the rule even
in moral philosophy, inasmuch as they are at variance with one another
on the main point <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) itself,
that is, in that discussion by which the life is moulded. For the
precepts cannot be equal, or resembling one another, when some train men
to pleasure, others to honour, others indeed to nature, others to
knowledge; some to the pursuit, others to the avoiding of riches; some
to entire insensibility to pain, others to the endurance of evils: in
all which, as I have shown before, they turn aside from reason, because
they are ignorant of God.
