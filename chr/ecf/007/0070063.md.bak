#### <span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XII.—Of the Twofold Conflict of Body and Soul; And of Desiring Virtue on Account of Eternal Life.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p1"></span>But our inquiry is as to the object
for which we are born: and thus we are able to trace out what is the
effect of virtue. There are two <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md)
parts of which man is made up, soul and body. There are many things
peculiar to the soul, many peculiar to the body, many common to both, as
is virtue itself; and as often as this is referred to the body, it is
called fortitude for the sake of distinction. Since, therefore,
fortitude is connected with each, a contest is proposed to each, and
victory held forth to each from the contest: the body, because it is
solid, and capable of being grasped, must contend with objects which are
solid and can be grasped; but the soul, on the other hand, because it is
slight <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) and subtle, and
invisible, contends with those enemies who cannot be seen and touched.
But what are the enemies of the soul, but lusts, vices, and sins? And if
virtue shall have overcome and put to flight these, the soul will be
pure and free from stain. Whence, then, are we able to collect what are
the effects of fortitude of soul? Doubtless from that which is closely
connected with it, and resembles it, that is, from fortitude of the
body; for when this has come to any encounter and contest, what else
does it seek from victory but life? For whether you contend with a man
or beast, the contest is for safety. Therefore, as the body obtains by
victory its preservation from destruction, so the soul obtains a
continuation of its existence; and as the body, when overcome by its
enemies, suffers death, so the soul, when overpowered by vices, must
die. What difference, therefore, will there be between the contest
carried on by the soul and that carried on by the body, except that the
body seeks for temporal, but the soul eternal life? If, therefore,
virtue is not happy by itself, since its whole force consists, as I have
said, in the enduring of evils; if it neglects all things which are
desired as goods; if in its highest condition it is exposed to death,
inasmuch as it often refuses life, which is desired by others, and
bravely undergoes death, which others fear; if it must necessarily
produce some great good from itself, because labours, endured and
overcome even until death, cannot fail of obtaining a reward; if no
reward, such as it deserves, is found on earth, inasmuch as it despises
all things which are frail and transitory, what else remains but that it
may effect some heavenly reward, since it treats with contempt all
earthly things, and may aim at higher things, since it despises things
that are humble? And this <span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p3.3"></span>reward
can be nothing else but immortality.  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p4"></span>With good reason, therefore, did
<span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p4.1"></span>Euclid, no obscure philosopher,
who was the founder of the system of the Megareans, differing from the
others, say that that was the chief good which was <span id="page_80">p.
80</span> <span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-Page_80"></span>unvarying and always
the same. He certainly understood what is the nature of the chief good,
although he did not explain in what it consisted; but it consists of
immortality, nor anything else at all, inasmuch as it alone is incapable
of diminution, or increase, or change. <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p4.2"></span>Seneca also unconsciously happened to
confess that there is no other reward of virtue than immortality. For in
praising virtue in the treatise which he wrote on the subject of
premature death, he says: “Virtue is the only thing which can confer
upon us immortality, and make us equal to the gods.” But the Stoics
also, whom he followed, say that no one can be made happy without
virtue. Therefore, the reward of virtue is a happy life, if virtue, as
it is rightly said, makes a happy life. Virtue, therefore, is not, as
they say, to be sought on its own account, but on account of a happy
life, which necessarily follows virtue. And this argument might have
taught them in what the chief good consisted. But this present and
corporeal life cannot be happy, because it is subjected to evils through
the body. <span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p4.3"></span>Epicurus calls God happy
and incorruptible, because He is everlasting. For a state of happiness
ought to be perfect, so that there may be nothing which can harass, or
lessen, or change it. Nor can anything be judged happy in other
respects, unless it be incorruptible. But nothing is incorruptible but
that which is immortal. Immortality therefore is alone happy, because it
can neither be corrupted nor destroyed. But if virtue falls within the
power of man, which no one can deny, happiness also belongs to him. For
it is impossible for a man to be wretched who is endued with virtue. If
happiness falls within his power, then immortality, which is possessed
of the attribute of happiness, also belongs to him.  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p5"></span>The chief good, therefore, is found
to be immortality alone, which pertains to no other animal or body; nor
can it happen to any one without the virtue of knowledge, that is,
without the knowledge of God and justice. And how true and right is the
seeking for this, the very desire of this life shows: for although it be
but temporary, and most full of labour, yet it is sought and desired by
all; for both old men and boys, kings and those of the lowest station,
in fine, wise as well as foolish, desire this. Of such value, as it
seemed to <span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p5.1"></span>Anaxagoras, is the
contemplation of the heaven and the light itself, that men willingly
undergo any miseries on this account. Since, therefore, this short and
laborious life, by the general consent not only of men, but also of
other animals, is considered a great good, it is manifest that it
becomes also a very great and perfect good if it is without an end and
free from all evil. In short, there never would have been any one who
would despise this life, however short it is, or undergo death, unless
through the hope of a longer life. For those who voluntarily offered
themselves to death for the safety of their countrymen, as <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p5.2"></span>Menœceus did at Thebes, <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p5.3"></span>Codrus at Athens, <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p5.4"></span>Curtius and the two Mures at Rome, would
never have preferred death to the advantages of life, unless they had
thought that they should attain to immortality through the estimation of
their countrymen; and although they were ignorant of the life of
immortality, yet the reality itself did not escape their notice. For if
virtue despises opulence and riches because they are frail, and
pleasures because they are of brief continuance, it therefore despises a
life which is frail and brief, that it may obtain one which is
substantial and lasting. Therefore reflection itself, advancing by
regular order, and weighing everything, leads us to that excellent and
surpassing good, on account of which we are born. And if philosophers
had thus acted, if they had not preferred obstinately to maintain that
which they had once apprehended, they would undoubtedly have arrived at
this truth, as I have lately shown. And if this was not the part of
those who extinguish the heavenly souls together with the body, yet
those who discuss the immortality of the soul ought to have understood
that virtue is set before us on this account, that, lusts having been
subdued, and the desire of earthly things overcome, our souls, pure and
victorious, may return to God, that is, to their original source. For it
is on this account that we alone of living creatures are raised to the
sight of the heaven, that we may believe that our chief good is in the
highest place. Therefore we alone receive religion, that we may know
from this source that the spirit of man is not mortal, since it longs
for and acknowledges God, who is immortal.  

<span id="iii.ii.iii.xii-p6"></span>Therefore, of all the philosophers,
those who have embraced either knowledge or virtue as the chief good,
have kept the way of truth, but have not arrived at perfection. For
these are the two things which together make up that which is sought
for. Knowledge causes us to know by what means and to what end we must
attain; virtue causes us to attain to it. The one without the other is
of no avail; for from knowledge arises virtue, and from virtue the chief
good is produced. Therefore a happy life, which philosophers have always
sought, and still do seek, has no existence either in the worship of the
gods or in philosophy; and on this account they were unable to find it,
because they did not seek the highest good in the highest place, but in
the lowest. For what is the highest but heaven, and God, from whom the
soul has its origin? And what is the lowest but the earth, from which
the body is made? Therefore, although some philosophers have assigned
the chief good, not to the body, but to the soul, yet, inasmuch as they
<span id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iii.xii-Page_81"></span>have referred it to this life, which
has its ending with the body, they have gone back to the body, to which
the whole of this time which is passed on earth has reference. Therefore
it was not without reason that they did not attain to the highest good;
for whatever looks to the body only, and is without immortality, must
necessarily be the lowest. Therefore happiness does not fall to the
condition of man in that manner in which philosophers thought; but it so
falls to him, not that he should then be happy, when he lives in the
body, which must undoubtedly be corrupted in order to its dissolution;
but then, when, the soul being freed from intercourse with the body, he
lives in the spirit only. In this one thing alone can we be happy in
this life, if we appear to be unhappy; if, avoiding the enticements of
pleasures, and giving ourselves to the service of virtue only, we live
in all labours and miseries, which are the means of exercising and
strengthening virtue; if, in short, we keep to that rugged and difficult
path which has been opened for us to happiness. The chief good therefore
which makes men happy cannot exist, unless it be in that religion and
doctrine to which is annexed the hope of immortality.
