#### <span id="ix.vii.vi-p0.1"></span><span id="page_464">p. 464</span> <span id="ix.vii.vi-Page_464"></span>Sec. VI.—Conclusion of the Work.

##### <span id="ix.vii.vi-p0.2"></span>That It is the Custom of Jews and Gentiles to Observe Natural Purgations, and to Abominate the Remains of the Dead; But that All This is Contrary to Christianity.

<span id="ix.vii.vi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>XXX</span>. Do not therefore keep any such
observances about legal and natural purgations, as thinking you are
defiled by them. Neither do you seek after Jewish separations, or
perpetual washings, or purifications upon the touch of a dead body. But
without such observations assemble in the dormitories, reading the holy
books, and singing for the martyrs which are fallen asleep, and for all
the saints from the beginning of the world, and for your brethren that
are asleep in the Lord, and offer the acceptable Eucharist, the
representation of the royal body of Christ, both in your churches and in
the dormitories; and in the funerals of the departed, accompany them
with singing, if they were faithful in Christ. For “precious in the
sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.” <span
id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331) And again: “O my soul, return unto
thy rest, for the Lord hath done thee good.” <span
id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332) And elsewhere: “The memory of the
just is with encomiums.” <span id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333) And,
“The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God.” <span
id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334) For those that have believed in
God, although they are asleep, are not dead. For our Saviour says to the
Sadducees: “But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not
read that which is written, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God, therefore, is not the God of the dead,
but of the living; for all live to Him.” <span
id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335) Wherefore, of those that live with
God, even their very relics are not without honour. For even <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p6.3"></span>Elisha the prophet, after he was fallen
asleep, raised up a dead man who was slain by the pirates of
Syria. <span id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336) For his body touched
the bones of <span id="ix.vii.vi-p7.3"></span>Elisha, and he arose and
revived. Now this would not have happened unless the body of <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p7.4"></span>Elisha were holy. And chaste <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p7.5"></span>Joseph embraced <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p7.6"></span>Jacob after he was dead upon his bed; <span
id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337) and <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p8.2"></span>Moses and <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p8.3"></span>Joshua the son of Nun carried away the relics
of <span id="ix.vii.vi-p8.4"></span>Joseph, <span
id="fr_3338"></span>[3339](#fn_3338) and did not esteem it a defilement.
Whence you also, O bishops, and the rest, who without such observances
touch the departed, ought not to think yourselves defiled. Nor abhor the
relics of such persons, but avoid such observances, for they are
foolish. And adorn yourselves with holiness and chastity, that ye may
become partakers of immortality, and partners of the kingdom of God, and
may receive the promise of God, and may rest for ever, through <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p9.4"></span>Jesus Christ our Saviour.  

<span id="ix.vii.vi-p10"></span>To Him, therefore, who is able to open
the ears of your hearts to the receiving the oracles of God administered
to you both by the Gospel and by the teaching of <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p10.1"></span>Jesus Christ of Nazareth; who was crucified
under <span id="ix.vii.vi-p10.2"></span>Pontius Pilate and <span
id="ix.vii.vi-p10.3"></span>Herod, and died, and rose again from the
dead, and will come again at the end of the world with power and great
glory, and will raise the dead, and put an end to this world, and
distribute to every one according to his deserts: to Him that has given
us Himself for an earnest of the resurrection; who was taken up into the
heavens by the power of His God and Father in our sight, who ate and
drank with Him for forty days after He arose from the dead; who is sat
down on the right hand of the throne of the majesty of Almighty God upon
the cherubim; to whom it was said, “Sit Thou on my right hand, until I
make Thine enemies Thy footstool;” <span
id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339) whom the most blessed Stephen saw
standing at the right hand of power, and cried out, and said, “Behold, I
see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of
God,” <span id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340) as the High Priest of
all the rational orders,—through Him, worship, and majesty, and glory be
given to Almighty God, both now and for evermore. <span
id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341) Amen.
