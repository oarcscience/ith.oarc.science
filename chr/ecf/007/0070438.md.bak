<span id="ix.iii.vi"></span>

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Sec. VI.—The Disputes of the Faithful to Be Settled by the Decisions of the Bishop, and the Faithful to Be Reconciled.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p1"></span>Do thou therefore, O bishop, together
with thy subordinate clergy, endeavour rightly to divide the word of
truth. For the Lord says: “If you walk cross-grained to me, I will walk
cross-grained to you.” <span id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787.md) And
elsewhere: “With the holy Thou wilt be holy, and with the perfect man
Thou wilt be perfect, and with the froward Thou wilt be froward.” <span
id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788.md) Walk therefore holily, that you may
rather appear worthy of praise from the Lord than of complaint from the
adversary.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p3.2"></span>That the Deacon is to Ease the Burden of the Bishops, and to Order the Smaller Matters Himself.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>XLIV</span>. Be ye of one mind, O ye bishops,
one with another, and be at peace with one another; sympathize with one
another, love the brethren, and feed the people with care; with one
consent teach those that are under you to be of the same sentiments and
to be of the same opinions about the same matters, “that there may be no
schisms among you; that ye may be one body and one spirit, perfectly
joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment,” <span
id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789.md) according to the appointment of the
Lord. And let the deacon refer all things to the bishop, as Christ does
to His Father. But let him order such things as he is able by himself,
receiving power from the bishop, as the Lord did from His Father the
power of creation and of providence. But the weighty matters let the
bishop judge; but let the deacon be the bishop’s ear, and eye, and
mouth, and heart, and soul, that the bishop may not be distracted with
many cares, but with such only as are more considerable, as <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p5.3"></span>Jethro did appoint for <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p5.4"></span>Moses, and his counsel was received. <span
id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790.md) <span id="page_417">p. 417</span>
<span id="ix.iii.vi-Page_417"></span>  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p6.2"></span>That Contentions and Quarrels are Unbecoming Christians.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p7.1"></span>XLV</span>. It is therefore a noble encomium
for a Christian to have no contest with any one; <span
id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791.md) but if by any management or
temptation a contest arises with any one, let him endeavour that it may
be composed, though thereby he be obliged to lose somewhat; and let it
not come before an heathen tribunal. Nay, indeed, you are not to permit
that the rulers of this world should pass sentence against your people;
for by them the devil contrives mischief to the servants of God, and
occasions a reproach to be cast upon us, as though we had not “one wise
man that is able to judge between his brethren,” or to decide their
controversies.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p8.2"></span>That Believers Ought Not to Go to Law Before Unbelievers; Nor Ought Any Unbeliever to Be Called for a Witness Against Believers.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p9.1"></span>XLVI.</span> Let not the heathen therefore
know of your differences among one another, nor do you receive
unbelievers as witnesses against yourselves, nor be judged by them, nor
owe them anything on account of tribute or fear; but “render to Cæsar
the things that are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things that are
God’s,” <span id="fr_2792"></span>[2793](#fn_2792.md) as tribute, taxes, or
poll-money, as our Lord by giving a piece of money was freed from
disturbance. <span id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793.md) Choose therefore
rather to suffer harm, and to endeavour after those things that make for
peace, not only among the brethren, but also among the unbelievers. For
by suffering loss in the affairs of this life, thou wilt be sure not to
suffer in the concerns of piety, and wilt live religiously, and
according to the command of Christ. <span
id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794.md) But if brethren have lawsuits one
with another, which God forbid, you who are the rulers ought thence to
learn that such as these do not do the work of brethren <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p12.2"></span>in the Lord, but rather of public enemies;
and one of the parties will be found to be mild, gentle, and the child
of light; but the other unmerciful, insolent, and covetous. Let him,
therefore, who is condemned be rebuked, let him be separated, let him
undergo the punishment of his hatred to his brother. Afterwards, when he
repents, let him be received; and so, when they have learned prudence,
they will ease your judicatures. It is also a duty to forgive each
other’s trespasses—not the duty of those that judge, but of those that
have quarrels; as the Lord determined when I Peter asked Him, “How oft
shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times?”
He replied, “I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but until seventy
times seven.” <span id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795.md) For so would
our Lord have us to be truly His disciples, and never to have anything
against anybody; as, for instance, anger without measure, passion
without mercy, covetousness without justice, hatred without
reconciliation. Draw by your instruction those who are angry to
friendship, and those who are at variance to agreement. For the Lord
says: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the
children of God.” <span id="fr_2796"></span>[2797](#fn_2796.md)  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p14.2"></span>That the Judicatures of Christians Ought to Be Held on the Second Day of the Week.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p15"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p15.1"></span>XLVII.</span> Let your judicatures be held
on the second day of the week, that if any controversy arise about your
sentence, having an interval till the Sabbath, <span
id="fr_2797"></span>[2798](#fn_2797.md) you may be able to set the
controversy right, and to reduce those to peace who have the contests
one with another against the Lord’s day. Let also the deacons and
presbyters be present at your judicatures, to judge without acceptance
of persons, as men of God, with righteousness. When, therefore, both the
parties are come, according as the law says, <span
id="fr_2798"></span>[2799](#fn_2798.md) those that have the controversy
shall stand severally in the middle of the court; and when you have
heard them, give your votes holily, endeavouring to make them both
friends before the sentence of the bishop, that judgment against the
offender may not go abroad into the world; knowing that he has in the
court the Christ of God as conscious of and confirming his judgment. But
if any persons are accused by any one, and their fame suffers as if they
did not walk uprightly in the Lord, in like manner you shall hear both
parties—the accuser and accused; but not with prejudice, nor with
hearkening to one part only, but with righteousness, as passing a
sentence concerning eternal life or death. For says God: “He shall
prosecute that which is right justly.” <span
id="fr_2799"></span>[2800](#fn_2799.md) For he that is justly punished and
separated by you is rejected from eternal life and glory; he becomes
dishonourable among holy men, and one condemned of God.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p18.2"></span>That the Same Punishment is Not to Be Inflicted for Every Offence, But Different Punishments for Different Offenders.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p19"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p19.1"></span>XLVIII</span>. Do not pass the same sentence
for every sin, but one suitable to each crime, distinguishing all the
several sorts of offences with much prudence, the great from the little.
Treat a wicked action after one manner, and a wicked word after another;
a bare intention still otherwise. <span id="page_418">p. 418</span>
<span id="ix.iii.vi-Page_418"></span>So also in the case of a contumely
or suspicion. And some thou shalt curb by threatenings alone; some thou
shalt punish with fines to the poor; some thou shalt mortify with
fastings; and others thou shalt separate according to the greatness of
their several crimes. For the law did not allot the same punishment to
every offence, but had a different regard to a sin against God, against
the priest, against the temple, or against the sacrifice; from a sin
against the king, or ruler, or a soldier, or a fellow-subject; and so
were the offences different which were against a servant, a possession,
or a brute creature. And again, sins were differently rated according as
they were against parents and kinsmen, and those differently which were
done on purpose from those that happened involuntarily. Accordingly the
punishments were different: as death either by crucifixion or by
stoning, fines, scourgings, or the suffering the same mischiefs they had
done to others. Wherefore do you also allot different penalties to
different offences, lest any injustice should happen, and provoke God to
indignation. For of what unjust judgment soever you are the instruments,
of the same you shall receive the reward from God. “For with what
judgment ye judge ye shall be judged.” <span
id="fr_2800"></span>[2801](#fn_2800.md)  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p20.2"></span>What are to Be the Characters of Accusers and Witnesses.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p21"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p21.1"></span>XLIX</span>. When, therefore, you are set
down at your tribunal, and the parties are both of them present (for we
will not call them brethren until they receive each other in peace),
examine diligently concerning those who appear before you; and first
concerning the accuser, whether this be the first person he has accused,
or whether he has advanced accusations against some others before, and
whether this contest and accusation of theirs does not arise from some
quarrel, and what sort of life the accuser leads. Yet, though he be of a
good conscience, do not give credit to him alone, for that is contrary
to the law; but let him have others to join in his testimony, and those
of the same course of life. As the law says: “At the mouth of two or
three witnesses everything shall be established.” <span
id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801.md) But why did we say that the
character of the witnesses was to be inquired after, of what sort it is?
Because it frequently happens that two and more testify for mischief,
and with joint consent prefer a lie; as did the two elders against <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p22.2"></span>Susanna in Babylon, <span
id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802.md) and the sons of transgressors
against <span id="ix.iii.vi-p23.2"></span>Naboth in Samaria, <span
id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803.md) and the multitude of the Jews
against our Lord at Jerusalem, <span
id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804.md) and against <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p25.2"></span>Stephen His first martyr. <span
id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805.md) Let the witnesses therefore be
meek, free from anger, full of equity, kind, prudent, continent, free
from wickedness, faithful, religious; for the testimony of such persons
is firm on account of their character, and true on account of their mode
of life. But as to those of a different character, do not ye receive
their testimony, although they seem to agree together in their evidence
against the accused; for it is ordained in the law: “Thou shalt not be
with a multitude for wickedness; thou shalt not receive a vain report;
thou shalt not consent with a multitude to pervert judgment.” <span
id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806.md) You ought also particularly to know
him that is accused; what he is in his course and mode of life; whether
he have a good report as to his life; whether he has been unblameable;
whether he has been zealous in holiness; whether he be a lover of the
widows, a lover of the strangers, a lover of the poor, and a lover of
the brethren; whether he be not given to filthy lucre; whether he be not
an extravagant person, or a spendthrift; whether he be sober, and free
from luxury, or a drunkard, or a glutton; whether he be compassionate
and charitable.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p27.2"></span>That Former Offences Do Sometimes Render After Accusations Credible.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p28"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p28.1"></span>L</span>. For if he has been before addicted
to wicked works, the accusations which are now brought against him will
thence in some measure appear to be true, unless justice do plainly
plead for him. For it may be, that though he had formerly been an
offender, yet that he may not be guilty of this crime of which he is
accused. Wherefore be exactly cautious about such circumstances, and so
render your sentences, when pronounced against the offender convicted,
safe and firm. And if, after his separation, he begs pardon, and falls
down before the bishop, and acknowledges his fault, receive him. But
neither do you suffer a false accuser to go unpunished, that he may not
calumniate another who lives well, or encourage some other person to do
like him. Nor, to be sure, do ye suffer a person convicted to go off
clear, lest another be ensnared in the same crimes. For neither shall a
witness of mischiefs be unpunished, nor shall he that offends be without
censure.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p28.2"></span>Against Judging Without Hearing Both Sides.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p29"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p29.1"></span>LI</span>. We said before that judgment
ought not to be given upon hearing only one of the parties; for if you
hear one of them when the other is not there, and so cannot make his
defence to the accusation brought against him, and rashly <span
id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span id="ix.iii.vi-Page_419"></span>give
your votes for condemnation, you will be found guilty of that man’s
destruction, and partaker with the false accuser before God, the just
Judge. For “as he that holdeth the tail of a dog, so is he that presides
at unjust judgment.” <span id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807.md) But if
ye become imitators of the elders in Babylon, who, when they had borne
witness against <span id="ix.iii.vi-p30.2"></span>Susanna, unjustly
condemned her to death, you will become obnoxious to their judgment and
condemnation. For the Lord by <span id="ix.iii.vi-p30.3"></span>Daniel
delivered <span id="ix.iii.vi-p30.4"></span>Susanna from the hand of the
ungodly, but condemned to the fire those elders who were guilty of her
blood, and reproaches you by him, saying: “Are ye so foolish, ye
children of Israel? Without examination, and without knowing the truth,
have ye condemned a daughter of Israel? Return again to the place of
judgment, for these men have borne false witness against her.” <span
id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808.md)  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p31.2"></span>The Caution Observed at Heathen Tribunals Before the Condemnation of Criminals Affords Christians a Good Example.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p32"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p32.1"></span>LII</span>. Consider even the judicatures of
this world, by whose power we see murderers, adulterers, wizards,
robbers of sepulchres, and thieves brought to trial; and those that
preside, when they have received their accusations from those that
brought them, ask the malefactor whether those things be so. And though
he does not deny the crimes, they do not presently send him out to
punishment; but for several days they make inquiry about him with a full
council, and with the veil interposed. And he that is to pass the final
decree and suffrage of death against him, lifts up his hands to the sun,
and solemnly affirms that he is innocent of the blood of the man. Though
they be heathens, and know not the Deity, nor the vengeance which will
fall upon men from God on account of those that are justly condemned,
they avoid such unjust judgments.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p32.2"></span>That Christians Ought Not to Be Contentious One with Another.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p33"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p33.1"></span>LIII</span>. But you who know who our God
is, and what are His judgments, how can you bear to pass an unjust
judgment, since your sentence will be immediately known to God? And if
you have judged righteously, you will be deemed worthy of the
recompenses of righteousness, both now and hereafter; but if
unrighteously, you will partake of the like. We therefore advise you,
brethren, rather to deserve commendation from God than rebukes; for the
commendation of God is eternal life to men, as is His rebuke everlasting
death. Be ye therefore righteous judges, peacemakers, and without anger.
For “he that is angry with his brother without a cause is obnoxious to
the judgment.” <span id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809.md) But if it
happens that by any one’s contrivance you are angry at anybody, “let not
the sun go down upon your wrath;” <span
id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810.md) for says <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p35.2"></span>David, “Be angry and sin not;” <span
id="fr_2811"></span>[2812](#fn_2811.md) that is, be soon reconciled, lest
your wrath continue so long that it turn to a settled hatred, and work
sin. “For the souls of those that bear a settled hatred are to
death,” <span id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md) says <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p37.2"></span>Solomon. But our Lord and Saviour <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p37.3"></span>Jesus Christ says in the Gospels: “If thou
bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath
ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy
way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
gift to God.” <span id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813.md) Now the gift to
God is every one’s prayer and thanksgiving. If, therefore, thou hast
anything against thy brother, or he has anything against thee, neither
will thy prayers be heard, nor will thy thanksgivings be accepted, by
reason of that hidden anger. But it is your duty, brethren, to pray
continually. Yet, because God hears not those which are at enmity with
their brethren by unjust quarrels, even though they should pray three
times an hour, it is our duty to compose all our enmity and littleness
of soul, that we may be able to pray with a pure and unpolluted heart.
For the Lord commanded us to love even our enemies, and by no means to
hate our friends. And the lawgiver says: “Thou shalt not hate any man;
thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy mind. Thou shalt certainly
reprove thy brother, and not incur sin on his account.” <span
id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814.md) “Thou shalt not hate an Egyptian,
for thou wast a sojourner with him. Thou shalt not hate an Idumæan, for
he is thy brother.” <span id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815.md) And <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p40.2"></span>David says: “If I have repaid those that
requited me evil.” <span id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md) Wherefore,
if thou wilt be a Christian, follow the law of the Lord: “Loose every
band of wickedness;” <span id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) for the
Lord has given thee authority to remit those sins to thy brother which
he has committed against thee as far as “seventy times seven,” <span
id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) that is, four hundred and ninety
times. How oft, therefore, hast thou remitted to thy brother, that thou
art unwilling to do it now, when thou also hast heard <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p43.2"></span>Jeremiah saying, “Do not any of you impute
the wickedness of his neighbour in your hearts?” <span
id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) But thou rememberest injuries, and
keepest enmity, and comest into judgment, and art suspicious of His
anger, and thy prayer is hindered. Nay, if thou hast remitted <span
id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span id="ix.iii.vi-Page_420"></span>to thy
brother four hundred and ninety times, do thou still multiply thy acts
of gentleness more, to do good for thy own sake. Although he does not do
so, yet, however, do thou endeavour to forgive thy brother for God’s
sake, “that thou mayest be the son of thy Father which is in
heaven,” <span id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) and when thou
prayest, mayest be heard as a friend of God.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p45.2"></span>That the Bishops Must by Their Deacon Put the People in Mind of the Obligation They are Under to Live Peaceably Together.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p46"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p46.1"></span>LIV</span>. Wherefore, O bishop, when you
are to go to prayer after the lessons, and the psalmody, and the
instruction out of the Scriptures, let the deacon stand nigh you, and
with a loud voice say: Let none have any quarrel with another; let none
come in hypocrisy; that if there be any controversy found among any of
you, they may be affected in conscience, and may pray to God, and be
reconciled to their brethren. For if, upon coming into any one’s house,
we are to say, “Peace be to this house,” <span
id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md) like sons of peace bestowing peace
on those who are worthy, as it is written, “He came and preached peace
to you that are nigh, and them that are far off, whom the Lord knows to
be His,” <span id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md) much more is it
incumbent on those that enter into the Church of God before all things
to pray for the peace of God. But if he prays for it upon others, much
more let himself be within the same, as a child of light; for he that
has it not within himself is not fit to bestow it upon others.
Wherefore, before all things, it is our duty to be at peace in our own
minds; for he that does not find any disorder in himself will not
quarrel with another, but will be peaceable, friendly, gathering the
Lord’s people, and a fellow-worker with him, in order to the increasing
the number of those that shall be saved in unanimity. For those who
contrive enmities, and strifes, and contests, and lawsuits, are wicked,
and aliens from God.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p48.4"></span>An Enumeration of the Several Instances of Divine Providence, and How in Every Age from the Beginning of the World God Has Invited All Men to Repentance.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p49"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p49.1"></span>LV</span>. For God, being a God of mercy
from the beginning, called every generation to repentance by righteous
men and prophets. He instructed those before the flood by <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p49.2"></span>Abel and <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p49.3"></span>Sem, and <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p49.4"></span>Seth, also by <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p49.5"></span>Enos, and by <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p49.6"></span>Enoch that was translated; those at the
flood by <span id="ix.iii.vi-p49.7"></span>Noah; the inhabitants of
Sodom by hospitable <span id="ix.iii.vi-p49.8"></span>Lot; those after
the flood by <span id="ix.iii.vi-p49.9"></span>Melchizedek, and the
patriarchs, and <span id="ix.iii.vi-p49.10"></span>Job the beloved of
God; the Egyptians by <span id="ix.iii.vi-p49.11"></span>Moses; the
Israelites by him, and <span id="ix.iii.vi-p49.12"></span>Joshua, and
<span id="ix.iii.vi-p49.13"></span>Caleb, and <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p49.14"></span>Phineas, and the rest; those after the law
by angels and prophets, and the same by His own incarnation <span
id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) of the Virgin; those a little
before His bodily appearance by <span id="ix.iii.vi-p50.2"></span>John
His forerunner, and the same by the same person after Christ’s birth,
saying, “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;” <span
id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) those after His passion by us, the
twelve apostles, and <span id="ix.iii.vi-p51.2"></span>Paul the chosen
vessel. We therefore, who have been vouchsafed the favour of being the
witnesses of His appearance, together with James the brother of our
Lord, and the other seventy-two disciples, and his seven deacons, have
heard from the mouth of our Lord <span id="ix.iii.vi-p51.3"></span>Jesus
Christ, and by exact knowledge declare “what is the will of God, that
good, and acceptable, and perfect will” <span
id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) which is made known to us by <span
id="ix.iii.vi-p52.2"></span>Jesus; that none should perish, but that all
men with one accord should believe in Him, and send unanimously praise
to Him, and thereby live for ever.  

#### <span id="ix.iii.vi-p52.3"></span>That It is the Will of God that Men Should Be of One Mind in Matters of Religion, in Accord with the Heavenly Powers.

<span id="ix.iii.vi-p53"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.iii.vi-p53.1"></span>LVI</span>. For this is that which our Lord
taught us when we pray to say to His Father, “Thy will be done, as in
heaven, so upon earth;” <span id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) that
as the heavenly natures of the incorporeal powers do all glorify God
with one consent, so also upon earth all men with one mouth and one
purpose may glorify the only, the one, and the true God, by Christ His
only-begotten. It is therefore His will that men should praise Him with
unanimity, and adore Him with one consent. <span
id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md) For this is His will in Christ,
that those who are saved by Him may be many; but that you do not
occasion any loss or diminution to Him, nor to the Church, or lessen the
number by one soul of man, as destroyed by you, which might have been
saved by repentance; and which therefore perishes not only by its own
sin, but also by your treachery besides, whereby you fulfil that which
is written, “He that gathereth not with me, scattereth.” <span
id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md) Such a one is a disperser of the
sheep, an adversary, an enemy of God, a destroyer of those lambs whose
Shepherd was the Lord, and we were the collectors out of various nations
and tongues, by much pains and danger, and perpetual labour, by

stripes, by imprisonments, that we might do the will of God, and fill
the feast-chamber with guests to sit down at His <span id="page_421">p.

and Catholic Church, with joyful and chosen people, singing hymns and
praises to God that has called them by us to life. And you, as much as
in you lies, have dispersed them. Do you also of the laity be at peace

to turn back, and tame, and restore those which seem wild. For this is
the greatest reward by His promise from God, “If thou fetch out the
worthy and precious from the unworthy, thou shalt be as my mouth.” <span
