#### <span id="viii.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V. <span id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426) —The Way of Death.

<span id="viii.iii.v-p3"></span>1. And the way of death <span
id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427) is this: First of all it is evil
and full of curse: <span id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428)
murders, <span id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429) adulteries, lusts,
fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines,
false witnessings, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness,
depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy,
over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness; 2. persecutors of the
good, <span id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430) hating truth, loving a
lie, not knowing a reward for righteousness, not cleaving <span
id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431) to good nor to righteous judgment,
watching not for that which is good, but for that which is evil; from
whom meekness and endurance are far, loving vanities, pursuing requital,
not pitying a poor man, not labouring for the afflicted, not knowing Him
that made them, murderers of children, destroyers of the handiwork of
God, turning away from him that is in want, afflicting him that is
distressed, advocates of the rich, lawless judges of the poor, utter
sinners. <span id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432) Be delivered,
children, from all these. <span id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2426"></span>[379:2427](0070413.htm#fr_2426) <span
id="viii.iii.v-p1.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.v-p2"></span> This chapter finds nearly exact
parallels in <span id="viii.iii.v-p2.1"></span>Barnabas, xx., and <span
id="viii.iii.v-p2.2"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 18, but with
curious variations.  

<span id="fn_2427"></span>[379:2428](0070413.htm#fr_2427) <span
id="viii.iii.v-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.v-p4"></span> <span
id="viii.iii.v-p4.1"></span>Barnabas has “darkness,” but afterwards “way
of eternal death.”  

<span id="fn_2428"></span>[379:2429](0070413.htm#fr_2428) <span
id="viii.iii.v-p4.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.v-p5"></span> Not in <span
id="viii.iii.v-p5.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, and no exact
parallel in <span id="viii.iii.v-p5.2"></span>Barnabas.  

<span id="fn_2429"></span>[379:2430](0070413.htm#fr_2429) <span
id="viii.iii.v-p5.3"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.v-p6"></span> Of the twenty-two sins named in this
verse, <span id="viii.iii.v-p6.1"></span>Barnabas gives fourteen, in
differing order, and in the singular; <span
id="viii.iii.v-p6.2"></span>Apostolic Constitutions gives all but one
(<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.v-p6.3"></span>υψος</span>,
“loftiness” “haughtiness”), in the same order, and with the same change
from plural to singular.  

<span id="fn_2430"></span>[379:2431](0070413.htm#fr_2430) <span
id="viii.iii.v-p6.4"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.v-p7"></span> This verse appears almost word for word
in <span id="viii.iii.v-p7.1"></span>Barnabas, with two additional
clauses.  

<span id="fn_2431"></span>[379:2432](0070413.htm#fr_2431) <span
id="viii.iii.v-p7.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.v-p8"></span> The <span
id="viii.iii.v-p8.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions give a parallel from
this point; verbally exact from the phrase, “not for that which is
good.”  

<span id="fn_2432"></span>[379:2433](0070413.htm#fr_2432) <span
id="viii.iii.v-p8.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.v-p9"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.v-p9.1"></span>πανθαμαρτητοι</span> occurs only here, and
in the parallel passage in <span id="viii.iii.v-p9.2"></span>Barnabas
(rendered in this edition “who are in every respect transgressors,” vol.
i. p. 149), and in <span id="viii.iii.v-p9.4"></span>Apostolic
Constitutions (rendered “full of sin”). A similar term occurs in the
recently recovered portion of 2 Clement, xviii., where Bishop <span
id="viii.iii.v-p9.5"></span>Lightfoot renders, as above, “an utter
sinner.”  

<span id="fn_2433"></span>[379:2434](0070413.htm#fr_2433) <span
id="viii.iii.v-p9.6"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.v-p10"></span> Found <span
id="viii.iii.v-p10.1"></span>verbatim in <span
id="viii.iii.v-p10.2"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, not in <span
id="viii.iii.v-p10.3"></span>Barnabas: with the latter there is no
further parallel, except a few phrases in chap. xvi. 2, 3 (which see).
