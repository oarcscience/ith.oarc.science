#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIV.—Of the Priesthood of Jesus Foretold by the Prophets.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p1"></span>From which things it is evident that
all the prophets declared concerning Christ, that it should come to pass
at some time, that being born with a body <span
id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640) of the race of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p2.2"></span>David, He should build an eternal temple
in honour of God, which is called the Church, and assemble all nations
to the true worship of God. This is the faithful house, this is the
everlasting temple; and if any one hath not sacrificed in this, he will
not have the reward of immortality. And since Christ was the builder of
this great and eternal temple, He must also have an everlasting
priesthood in it; and there can be no approach to the shrine of the
temple, and to the sight of God, except through Him who built the
temple. <span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p2.3"></span>David in the cixth Psalm
teaches the same, saying: <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641)
“Before the morning-star I begat Thee. The Lord hath sworn, and will not
repent; Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p3.3"></span>Melchisedec.” Also in the first book of
Kings: <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642) “And I will raise me up a
faithful Priest, who shall do all things that are in mine heart; and I
will build him a sure <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643) house; and
he shall walk in my sight <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644) all
his days.” But who this was about to be, to whom God promised an
everlasting priesthood, <span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p6.8"></span>Zechariah
most plainly teaches, even mentioning His name: <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645) “And the Lord God showed <span
id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-Page_114"></span>me
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p7.2"></span>Jesus <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646) the great Priest standing before the
face of the angel of the Lord, and the adversary <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647) was standing at His right hand to
resist Him. And the Lord said unto the adversary, The Lord who hath
chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee; and lo, a brand plucked out of the fire.
And <span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p9.3"></span>Jesus was clothed with filthy
garments, and He was standing before the face of the angel. And He
answered and spake unto those that stood around before His face, saying,
Take away the filthy garments from Him, and clothe Him with a
flowing <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648) garment, and place a
fair mitre <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649) upon His head; and
they clothed Him with a garment, and placed a fair mitre upon His head.
And the angel of the Lord stood, and protested, saying to <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p11.2"></span>Jesus: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, If
Thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts, Thou shalt judge my
house, and I will give Thee those that may walk with Thee in the midst
of these that stand by. Hear, therefore, O <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p11.3"></span>Jesus, Thou great Priest.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p12"></span>Who, therefore, would not believe
that the Jews were then deprived of understanding, who, when they read
and heard these things, laid impious hands upon their God? But from the
time in which <span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p12.1"></span>Zechariah lived,
until the fifteenth year of the reign of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p12.2"></span>Tiberius Cæsar, in which Christ was
crucified, nearly five hundred years are reckoned; since he flourished
in the time of <span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p12.3"></span>Darius and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p12.4"></span>Alexander, <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650) who lived not long after the
banishment of <span id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p13.1"></span>Tarquinius Superbus.
But they were again misled and deceived in the same manner, in supposing
that these things were spoken concerning <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p13.2"></span>Jesus <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651) the son of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p14.5"></span>Nave, who was the successor of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p14.6"></span>Moses, or concerning <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p14.7"></span>Jesus the high priest the son of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p14.8"></span>Josedech; to whom none of those things
which the prophet related was suited. For they were never clothed in
filthy garments, since one of them was a most powerful prince, and the
other high priest; or suffered any adversity, so that they should be
regarded as a brand plucked from the fire: not did they ever stand in
the presence of God and the angels; nor did the prophet speak of the
past so much as of the future. He spoke, therefore, of <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xiv-p14.9"></span>Jesus the Son of God, to show that He
would first come in humility and in the flesh. For this is the filthy
garment, that He might prepare a temple for God, and might be
scorched <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652) as a brand with
fire—that is, might endure tortures from men, and at last be
extinguished. For a half-burnt brand drawn forth from the hearth and
extinguished, is commonly so called. <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653) But in what manner and with what
commands He was sent by God to the earth, the Spirit of God declared
through the prophet, teaching us that when He had faithfully and
uniformly fulfilled the will of His supreme Father, He should receive
judgment <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654) and an everlasting
dominion. If, He says, Thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts,
then Thou shalt judge my house. What these ways of God were, and what
His precepts, is neither doubtful nor obscure. For God, when He saw that
wickedness and the worship of false gods had so prevailed throughout the
world, that His name had now also been taken away from the memory of men
(since even the Jews, who alone had been entrusted with the secret of
God, had deserted the living God, and, ensnared by the deceits of
demons, had gone astray, and turned aside to the worship of images, and
when rebuked by the prophets did not choose to return to God), He sent
His Son <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655) as an ambassador to men,
that He might turn them from their impious and vain worship to the
knowledge and worship of the true God; and also that He might turn their
minds from foolishness to wisdom, and from wickedness to deeds of
righteousness. These are the ways of God, in which He enjoined Him to
walk. These are the precepts which He ordered to be observed. But He
exhibited faith towards God. For He taught that there is but one God,
and that He alone ought to be worshipped. Nor did He at any time say
that He Himself was God; for He would not have maintained His
faithfulness, if, when sent to abolish the false gods, and to assert the
existence of the one God, He had introduced another besides that one.
This would have been not to proclaim one God, nor to do the work of Him
who sent Him, but to discharge a peculiar office for Himself, and to
separate Himself from Him whom He came to reveal. On which account,
because He was so faithful, because He arrogated nothing at all to
Himself, that He might fulfil the commands of Him who sent Him, He
received the dignity of everlasting Priest, and the honour of supreme
King, and the authority of Judge, and the name of God.
