#### <span id="iii.v.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIX.

<span id="iii.v.xxix-p1"></span>Then <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p1.1"></span>Maximian returned into Gaul; and after
having made some stay in those quarters, he went to <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p1.2"></span>Galerius, the enemy of his son, that they
might confer together, as he pretended, about the settlement of the
commonweal; but his true purpose was, under colour of reconciliation, to
find an opportunity of murdering <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p1.3"></span>Galerius, and of seizing his share of the
empire, instead of his own, from which he had been everywhere excluded.
 

<span id="iii.v.xxix-p2"></span><span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="iii.v.xxix-Page_313"></span><span
id="iii.v.xxix-p2.1"></span>Diocles was at the court of <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p2.2"></span>Galerius when <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p2.3"></span>Maximian arrived; for <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p2.4"></span>Galerius, meaning now to invest <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p2.5"></span>Licinius with the ensigns of supreme power
in the room of <span id="iii.v.xxix-p2.6"></span>Severus, had lately
sent for <span id="iii.v.xxix-p2.7"></span>Diocles to be present at the
solemnity. So it was performed in presence both of him and of <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p2.8"></span>Maximian; and thus there were six who ruled
the empire at one and the same time. <span
id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md)  

<span id="iii.v.xxix-p4"></span>Now the designs of <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p4.1"></span>Maximian having been frustrated, he took
flight, as he had done twice before, and returned into Gaul, with a
heart full of wickedness, and intending by treacherous devices to
overreach <span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.2"></span>Constantine, who was not
only his own son-in-law, but also the child of his son-in-law; and that
he might the more successfully deceive, he laid aside the imperial
purple. The Franks had taken up arms. <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p4.3"></span>Maximian advised the unsuspecting <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p4.4"></span>Constantine not to lead all his troops
against them, and he said that a few soldiers would suffice to subdue
those barbarians. He gave this advice that an army might be left for him
to win over to himself, and that <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p4.5"></span>Constantine, by reason of his scanty forces,
might be overpowered. The young prince believed the advice to be
judicious, because given by an aged and experienced commander; and he
followed it, because given by a father-in-law. He marched, leaving the
most considerable part of his forces behind. <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p4.6"></span>Maximian waited a few days; and as soon as,
by his calculation, <span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.7"></span>Constantine had
entered the territory of the barbarians, he suddenly resumed the
imperial purple, seized the public treasures, after his wont made ample
donatives to the soldiery, and feigned that such disasters had befallen
<span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.8"></span>Constantine as soon after befell
himself. <span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.9"></span>Constantine was presently
informed of those events, and, by marches astonishingly rapid, he flew
back with his army. <span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.10"></span>Maximian, not yet
prepared to oppose him, was overpowered at unawares, and the soldiers
returned to their duty. <span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.11"></span>Maximian had
possessed himself of Marseilles (he fled thither), and shut the gates.
<span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.12"></span>Constantine drew nigh, and seeing
<span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.13"></span>Maximian on the walls, addressed him
in no harsh or hostile language, and demanded what he meant, and what it
was that he wanted, and why he had acted in a way so peculiarly
unbecoming him. But <span id="iii.v.xxix-p4.14"></span>Maximian from the
walls incessantly uttered abuse and curses against <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p4.15"></span>Constantine. Then, of a sudden, the gates
on the opposite side having been unbarred, the besiegers were admitted
into the city. The rebel emperor, and unnatural parent and a perfidious
father-in-law, was dragged into the presence of <span
id="iii.v.xxix-p4.16"></span>Constantine, heard a recital made of his
crimes, was divested of his imperial robe, and, after this reprimand,
obtained his life.
