#### <span id="iii.v.i-p0.1"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="iii.v.i-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p1.1"></span>The Lord has
heard those supplications which you, my best beloved <span
id="iii.v.i-p1.2"></span>Donatus, <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) pour forth in His presence all the
day long, and the supplications of the rest of our brethren, who by a
glorious confession have obtained an everlasting crown, the reward of
their faith. Behold, all the adversaries are destroyed, and tranquillity
having been re-established throughout the Roman empire, the late
oppressed Church arises again, and the temple of God, overthrown by the
hands of the wicked, is built with more glory than before. For God has
raised up princes to rescind the impious and sanguinary edicts of the
tyrants and provide for the welfare of mankind; so that now the cloud of
past times is dispelled, and peace and serenity gladden all hearts. And
after the furious whirlwind and black tempest, the heavens are now
become calm, and the wished-for light has shone forth; and now God, the
hearer of prayer, by His divine aid has lifted His prostrate and
afflicted servants from the ground, has brought to an end the united
devices of the wicked, and wiped off the tears from the faces of those
who mourned. They who insulted over the Divinity, lie low; they who cast
down the holy temple, are fallen with more tremendous ruin; and the
tormentors of just men have poured out their guilty souls amidst plagues
inflicted by Heaven, and amidst deserved tortures. For God delayed to
punish them, that, by great and marvellous examples, He might teach
posterity that He alone is God, and that with fit vengeance He executes
judgment on the proud, the impious, and the persecutors. <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md)  

<span id="iii.v.i-p4"></span>Of the end of those men I have thought good
to publish a narrative, that all who are afar off, and all who shall
arise hereafter, may learn how the Almighty manifested His power and
sovereign greatness in rooting out and utterly destroying the enemies of
His name. And this will become evident, when I relate <span
id="iii.v.i-p4.1"></span>who were the persecutors of the Church from the
time of its first constitution, and <span id="iii.v.i-p4.2"></span>what
were the punishments by which the divine Judge, in His severity, took
vengeance on them.

the Arch of Constantine, and, while he looks upon it (as the mark of an

there let him recall this noble chapter.\]
