<span id="vi.ii.xviii"></span>

#### <span id="vi.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>from the twentieth chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.xviii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>1–3.
“And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the abyss,
and a chain in his hand. And he held the dragon, that old serpent, which
is called the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and
cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that
he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be
finished: after this he must be loosed a little season.”\] Those years
wherein Satan is bound are in the first advent of Christ, even to the
end of the age; and they are called a thousand, according to that mode
of speaking, wherein a part is signified by the whole, just as is that
passage, “the word which He commanded for a thousand generations,” <span
id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) although they are not a thousand.
Moreover that he says, “and he cast him into the abyss,” he says this,
because the devil, excluded from the hearts of believers, began to take
possession of the wicked, in whose hearts, blinded day by day, he is
shut up as if in a profound abyss. And he shut him up, says he, and put
a seal upon him, that he should not deceive the nations until the
thousand years should be finished. “He shut the door upon him,” it is
said, that is, he forbade and restrained his seducing those who belong
to Christ. Moreover, he put a seal upon him, because it is hidden who
belong to the side of the devil, and who to that of Christ. For we know
not of those who seem to stand whether they shall not fall, and of those
who are down it is uncertain whether they may rise. Moreover, that he
says that he is bound and shut up, that he may not seduce the nations,
the nations signify the Church, seeing that of them it itself is formed,
and which being seduced, he previously held until, he says, the thousand
years should be completed, that is, what is left of the sixth day, to
wit, of the sixth age, which subsists for a thousand years; after this
he must be loosed for a little season. The little season signifies three
years and six months, in which with all his power the devil will avenge
himself under Antichrist<span id="page_359">p. 359</span> <span
id="vi.ii.xviii-Page_359"></span> against the Church. Finally, he says,
after that the devil shall be loosed, and will seduce the nations in the
whole world, and will entice war against the Church, the number of whose
foes shall be as the sand of the sea. <span
id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.xviii-p4"></span><span id="vi.ii.xviii-p4.1"></span>4,
5. “And I saw thrones, and them that sat upon them, and judgment was
given unto them; and <span id="vi.ii.xviii-p4.2"></span>I saw the souls
of them that were slain on account of the testimony of <span
id="vi.ii.xviii-p4.3"></span>Jesus, and for the word of God, and which
had not worshipped the beast nor his image, nor have received his
writing on their forehead or in their hand; and they reigned with Christ
for a thousand years: the rest of them lived not again until the
thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.”\] There
are two resurrections. But the first resurrection is now of the souls
that are by the faith, which does not permit men to pass over to the
second death. Of this resurrection the apostle says: “If ye have risen
with Christ, seek those things which are above.” <span
id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.xviii-p6"></span><span id="vi.ii.xviii-p6.1"></span>6.
“Blessed and holy is he who has part in this resurrection: on them the
second death shall have no power, but they shall be priests of God and
Christ, and they shall reign with Him a thousand years.”\] I do not
think the reign of a thousand years is eternal; or if it is thus to be
thought of, they cease to reign when the thousand years are finished.
But I will put forward what my capacity enables me to judge. The tenfold
number signifies the decalogue, and the hundredfold sets forth the crown
of virginity: for he who shall have kept the undertaking of virginity
completely, and shall have faithfully fulfilled the precepts of the
decalogue, and shall have destroyed the untrained nature or impure
thoughts within the retirement of the heart, that they may not rule over
him, this is the true priest of Christ, and accomplishing the millenary
number thoroughly, is thought to reign with Christ; and truly in his
case the devil is bound. But he who is entangled in the vices and the
dogmas of heretics, in his case the devil is loosed. But that it says
that when the thousand years are finished he is loosed, so the number of
the perfect saints being completed, in whom there is the glory of
virginity in body and mind, by the approaching advent of the kingdom of
the hateful one, many, seduced by that love of earthly things, shall be
overthrown, and together with him shall enter the lake of fire.  

<span id="vi.ii.xviii-p7"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xviii-p7.1"></span>8–10. “And they went up upon the breadth of
the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved
city; and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And
the devil who seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
where both the beast and the false prophet shall be tormented day and
night for ever and ever.”\] This belongs to the last judgment. And after
a little time the earth was made holy, as being at least that wherein
lately had reposed the bodies of the virgins, when they shall enter upon
an eternal kingdom with an immortal King, as they who are not only
virgins in body, but, moreover, with equal inviolability have protected
themselves, both in tongue and thought, from wickedness; and these, it
shows, shall dwell in rejoicing for ever with the Lamb.
