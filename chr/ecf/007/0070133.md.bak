#### <span id="iii.ii.v.xx-p0.1"></span>Chap. XX.—Of the Vanity and Crimes, Impious Superstitions, and of the Tortures of the Christians.

<span id="iii.ii.v.xx-p1"></span>Therefore, let those who destroy their
own souls and the souls of others learn what an inexpiable crime they
commit; in the first place, because they cause their own death by
serving most abandoned demons, whom God has condemned to everlasting
punishments; in the next place, because they do not permit God to be
worshipped by others, but endeavour to turn men aside to deadly rites,
and strive with the greatest diligence that no life may be without
injury on earth, which looks to heaven with its condition secured. What
else shall I call them but miserable men, who obey the instigations of
their own plunderers, <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) whom
they think to be gods? of whom they neither know the condition, nor
origin, nor names, nor nature; but, clinging to the persuasion of the
people, they willingly err, and favour their own folly. And if you
should ask them the grounds of their persuasion, they can assign none,
but have recourse to the judgment of their ancestors, saying that they
were wise, that they approved them, that they knew what was best; and
thus they deprive themselves of all power of perception: they bid adieu
to reason, while they place confidence in the errors of others. Thus,
involved in ignorance <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> <span
id="iii.ii.v.xx-Page_156"></span>of all things, they neither know
themselves nor their gods. And would to heaven that they had been
willing to err by themselves, and to be unwise by themselves! But they
hurry away others also to be companions of their evil, as though they
were about to derive comfort from the destruction of many. But this very
ignorance causes them to be so cruel in persecuting the wise; and they
pretend that they are promoting their welfare, that they wish to recall
them to a good mind.  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xx-p3"></span>Do they then strive to effect this by
conversation, or by giving some reason? By no means; but they endeavour
to effect it by force and tortures. O wonderful and blind infatuation!
It is thought that there is a bad mind in those who endeavour to
preserve their faith, but a good one in executioners. Is there, then, a
bad mind in those who, against every law of humanity, against every
principle of justice, are tortured, or rather, in those who inflict on
the bodies of the innocent such things, as neither the most cruel
robbers, nor the most enraged enemies, nor the most savage barbarians
have ever practised? Do they deceive themselves to such an extent, that
they mutually transfer and change the names of good and evil? Why,
therefore, do they not call day night—the sun darkness? Moreover, it is
the same impudence to give to the good the name of evil, to the wise the
name of foolish, to the just the name of impious. Besides this, if they
have any confidence in philosophy or in eloquence, let them arm
themselves, and refute these arguments of ours if they are able; let
them meet us hand to hand, and examine every point. It is befitting that
they should undertake the defence of their gods, lest, if our affairs
should increase (as they do increase daily), theirs should be deserted,
together with their shrines and their vain mockeries; <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) and since they can effect nothing
by violence (for the religion of God is increased the more it is
oppressed), let them rather act by the use of reason and exhortations.  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xx-p5"></span>Let their priests come forth into the
midst, whether the inferior ones or the greatest; their flamens, augurs,
and also sacrificing kings, and the priests and ministers of their
superstitions. Let them call us together to an assembly; let them exhort
us to undertake the worship of their gods; let them persuade us that
there are many beings by whose deity and providence all things are
governed; let them show how the origins and beginnings of their sacred
rites and gods were handed down to mortals; let them explain what is
their source and principle; let them set forth what reward there is in
their worship, and what punishment awaits neglect; why they wish to be
worshipped by men; what the piety of men contributes to them, if they
are blessed: and let them confirm all these things not by their own
assertion (for the authority of a mortal man is of no weight), but by
some divine testimonies, as we do. There is no occasion for violence and
injury, for religion cannot be imposed by force; the matter must be
carried on by words rather than by blows, that the will may be affected.
Let them unsheath the weapon of their intellect; if their system is
true, let it be asserted. We are prepared to hear, if they teach; while
they are silent, we certainly pay no credit to them, as we do not yield
to them even in their rage. Let them imitate us in setting forth the
system of the whole matter: for we do not entice, as they say; but we
teach, we prove, we show. And thus no one is detained by us against his
will, for he is unserviceable to God who is destitute of faith and
devotedness; and yet no one departs from us, since the truth itself
detains him. Let them teach in this manner, if they have any confidence
in the truth; let them speak, let them give utterance; let them venture,
I say, to discuss with us something of this nature; and then assuredly
their error and folly will be ridiculed by the old women, whom they
despise, and by our boys. For, since they are especially clever, they
know from books the race of the gods, and their exploits, and commands,
and deaths, and tombs; they may also know that the rites themselves, in
which they have been initiated, had their origin either in human
actions, or in casualties, or in deaths. <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) It is the part of incredible
madness to imagine that they are gods, whom they cannot deny to have
been mortal; or if they should be so shameless as to deny it, their own
writings, and those of their own people, will refute them; in short, the
very beginnings of the sacred rites will convict them. <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) They may know, therefore, even from
this very thing, how great a difference there is between truth and
falsehood; for they themselves with all their eloquence are unable to
persuade, whereas the unskilled and the uneducated are able, because the
matter itself and the truth speaks.  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xx-p8"></span>Why then do they rage, so that while
they wish to lessen their folly, they increase it? Torture <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) and piety are widely different; nor
is it possible for truth to be united with violence, or justice with
cruelty. But with good reason they do not venture to teach anything
concerning divine things, lest they should both be derided by our people
and be deserted by their own. For the common people for the most part,
if they ascertain that these mysteries were instituted in memory of the
dead, will condemn them, and seek for some truer object of worship.
<span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="iii.ii.v.xx-Page_157"></span>  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.xx-p9.2"></span> “Hence rites of mystic awe” <span
> id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xx-p11"></span>were instituted by crafty men, that
the people may not know what they worship. But since we are acquainted
with their systems, why do they either not believe us who are acquainted
with both, or envy us because we have preferred truth to falsehood? But,
they say, the public rites of religion <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) must be defended. Oh with what an
honourable inclination the wretched men go astray! For they are aware
that there is nothing among men more excellent than religion, and that
this ought to be defended with the whole of our power; but as they are
deceived in the matter of religion itself, so also are they in the
manner of its defence. For religion is to be defended, not by putting to
death, but by dying; not by cruelty, but by patient endurance; not by
guilt, but by good faith: for the former belong to evils, but the latter
to goods; and it is necessary for that which is good to have place in
religion, and not that which is evil. For if you wish to defend religion
by bloodshed, and by tortures, and by guilt, it will no longer be
defended, but will be polluted and profaned. For nothing is so much a
matter of free-will as religion; in which, if the mind of the worshipper
is disinclined to it, religion is at once taken away, and ceases to
exist. The right method therefore is, that you defend religion by
patient endurance or by death; in which the preservation of the faith is
both pleasing to God Himself, and adds authority to religion. For if he
who in this earthly warfare preserves his faith to his king in some
illustrious action, if he shall continue to live, because more beloved
and acceptable, and if he shall fall, obtains the highest glory, because
he has undergone death for his leader; how much more is faith to be kept
towards God, the Ruler of all, who is able to pay the reward of virtue,
not only to the living, but also to the dead! Therefore the worship of
God, since it belongs to heavenly warfare, requires the greatest
devotedness and fidelity. For how will God either love the worshipper,
if He Himself is not loved by him, or grant to the petitioner whatever
he shall ask, when he draws nigh to offer his prayer without sincerity
or reverence? But these men, when they come to offer sacrifice, present
to their gods nothing from within, nothing of their own—no uprightness
of mind, no reverence or fear. Therefore, when the worthless sacrifices
are completed, they leave their religion altogether in the temple, and
with the temple, as they had found it; and neither bring with them
anything of it, nor take anything back. Hence it is that religious
observances of this kind are neither able to make men good, nor to be
firm and unchangeable. And thus men are easily led away from them,
because nothing is learned in them relating to the life, nothing
relating to wisdom, nothing to faith. <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) For what is the religion of those
gods? what is its power? what its discipline? what its origin? what its
principle? what its foundation? what its substance? what is its
tendency? or what does it promise, so that it may be faithfully
preserved and boldly defended by man? I see nothing else in it than a
rite pertaining to the fingers only. <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) But our religion is on this account
firm, and solid, and unchangeable, because it teaches justice, because
it is always with us, because it has its existence altogether in the
soul of the worshipper, because it has the mind itself for a sacrifice.
In that religion nothing else is required but the blood of animals, and
the smoke of incense, and the senseless pouring out of libations; but in
this of ours, a good mind, a pure breast, an innocent life: those rites
are frequented by unchaste adulteresses without any discrimination, by
impudent procuresses, by filthy harlots; they are frequented by
gladiators, robbers, thieves, and sorcerers, who pray for nothing else
but that they may commit crimes with impunity. For what can the robber
ask when he sacrifices, or the gladiator, but that they may slay? what
the poisoner, but that he may escape notice? what the harlot, but that
she may sin to the uttermost? what the adulteress, but either the death
of her husband, or that her unchastity may be concealed? what the
procuress, but that she may deprive many of their property? what the
thief, but that he may commit more peculations? But in our religion
there is no place even for a slight and ordinary offence; and if any one
shall come to a sacrifice without a sound conscience, he hears what
threats God denounces against him: that God, I say, who sees the secret
places of the heart, who is alway hostile to sins, who requires justice,
who demands fidelity. What place is there here for an evil mind or for
an evil prayer? But those unhappy men neither understand from their own
crimes how evil it is to worship, since, defiled by all crimes, they
come to offer prayer; and they imagine that they offer a pious sacrifice
if they wash their skin; as though any streams could wash away, or any
seas purify, the lusts which are shut up within their breast. How much
better it is rather to cleanse the mind, which is defiled by evil
desires, and to drive away all vices by the one laver of virtue and
faith! For he who shall do this, although he bears a body which is
defiled and sordid, is pure enough. <span id="page_158">p. 158</span>
