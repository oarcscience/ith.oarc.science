<span id="vi.ii.xi"></span>

#### <span id="vi.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>from the eleventh chapter.

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>1. “And
there was shown unto me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood,
saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them
that worship therein.”\] A reed was shown like to a rod. This itself is
the Apocalypse which he subsequently exhibited to the churches; for the
Gospel of the complete faith he subsequently wrote for the sake of our
salvation. For when <span id="vi.ii.xi-p1.2"></span>Valentinus, and
<span id="vi.ii.xi-p1.3"></span>Cerinthus, and <span
id="vi.ii.xi-p1.4"></span>Ebion, and others of the school of Satan, were
scattered abroad throughout the world, there assembled together to him
from the neighbouring provinces all the bishops, and compelled <span
id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span id="vi.ii.xi-Page_354"></span>him
himself also to draw up his testimony. Moreover, we say that the measure
of God’s temple is the command of God to confess the Father Almighty,
and that His Son Christ was begotten by the Father before the beginning
of the world, and was made man in very soul and flesh, both of them
having overcome misery and death; and that, when received with His body
into heaven by the Father, He shed forth the Holy Spirit, the gift and
pledge of immortality, that He was announced by the prophets, He was
described by the law, He was God’s hand, and the Word of the Father from
God, Lord over all, and founder of the world: this is the reed and the
measure of faith; and no one worships the holy altar save he who
confesses this faith.  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>2. “The
court which is within the temple leave out.”\] The space which is called
the court is the empty altar within the walls: these being such as were
not necessary, he commanded to be ejected from the Church.  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p3"></span>“It is given to be trodden down by the
Gentiles.”\] That is, to the men of this world, that it may be trodden
under foot by the nations, or with the nations. Then he repeats about
the destruction and slaughter of the last time, and says:—  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p4"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p4.1"></span>3. “They
shall tread the holy city down for forty and two months; and I will give
to my two witnesses, and they shall predict a thousand two hundred and
threescore days clothed in sackcloth.”\] That is, three years and six
months: these make forty-two months. Therefore their preaching is three
years and six months, and the kingdom of Antichrist as much again.  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p5"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p5.1"></span>5. “If any
man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth
their enemies.”\] That fire proceedeth out of the mouth of those
prophets against the adversaries, bespeaks the power of the world. For
all afflictions, however many there are, shall be sent by their
messengers in their word. Many think that there is <span
id="vi.ii.xi-p5.2"></span>Elisha, or <span
id="vi.ii.xi-p5.3"></span>Moses, with <span
id="vi.ii.xi-p5.4"></span>Elijah; but both of these died; while the
death of <span id="vi.ii.xi-p5.5"></span>Elijah is not heard of, with
whom all our ancients have believed that it was <span
id="vi.ii.xi-p5.6"></span>Jeremiah. For even the very word spoken to him
testifies to him, saying, “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew
thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee,
and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.” <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) But he was not a prophet unto the
nations; and thus the truthful word of God makes it necessary, which it
has promised to set forth, that he should be a prophet to the nations.  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p7"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p7.1"></span>4. “These
are the two candlesticks standing before the Lord of the earth.”\] These
two candlesticks and two olive trees He has to this end spoken of, and
admonished you that if, when you have read of them elsewhere, you have
not understood, you may understand here. For in Zechariah, one of the
twelve prophets, it is thus written: “These are the two olive trees and
two candlesticks which stand in the presence of the Lord of the
earth;” <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md) that is, they are in
paradise. Also, in another sense, standing in the presence of the lord
of the earth, that is, in the presence of Antichrist. Therefore they
must be slain by Antichrist.  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p9"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p9.1"></span>7. “And
the beast which ascendeth from the abyss.”\] After many plagues
completed in the world, in the end he says that a beast ascended from
the abyss. But that he shall ascend from the abyss is proved by many
testimonies; for he says in the thirty-first chapter of Ezekiel:
“Behold, Assur was a cypress in Mount Lebanon.” Assur, deeply rooted,
was a lofty and branching cypress—that is, a numerous people—in Mount
Lebanon, in the kingdom of kingdoms, that is, of the Romans. Moreover,
that he says he was beautiful in offshoots, he says he was strong in
armies. The water, he says, shall nourish him, that is, the many
thousands of men which were subjected to him; and the abyss increased
him, that is, belched him forth. For even <span
id="vi.ii.xi-p9.2"></span>Isaiah speaks almost in the same words;
moreover, that he was in the kingdom of the Romans, and that he was
among the Cæsars. The Apostle <span id="vi.ii.xi-p9.3"></span>Paul also
bears witness, for he says to the Thessalonians: “Let him who now
restraineth restrain, until he be taken out of the way; and then shall
appear that Wicked One, even he whose coming is after the working of
Satan, with signs and lying wonders.” <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) And that they might know that he
should come who then was the prince, he added: “He already endeavours
after the secret of mischief” <span id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md)
—that is, the mischief which he is about to do he strives to do
secretly; but he is not raised up by his own power, nor by that of his
father, but by command of God, of which thing <span
id="vi.ii.xi-p11.2"></span>Paul says in the same passage: “For this
cause, because they have not received the love of God, He will send upon
them a spirit of error, that they all may be persuaded of a lie, who
have not been persuaded of the truth.” <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) And Isaiah saith: “While they
waited for the light, darkness arose upon them.” <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md) Therefore the Apocalypse sets forth
that these prophets are killed by the same, and on the fourth day rise
again, that none might be found equal to God.  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p14"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p14.1"></span>8. “And
their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city, which
spiritually is called <span id="page_355">p. 355</span> <span
id="vi.ii.xi-Page_355"></span>Sodom and Egypt.”\] But He calls Jerusalem
Sodom and Egypt, since it had become the heaping up of the persecuting
people. Therefore it behooves us diligently, and with the utmost care,
to follow the prophetic announcement, and to understand what the Spirit
from the Father both announces and anticipates, and how, when He has
gone forward to the last times, He again repeats the former ones. And
now, what He will do once for all, He sometimes sets forth as if it were
done; and unless you understand this, as sometimes done, and sometimes
as about to be done, you will fall into a great confusion. Therefore the
interpretation of the following sayings has shown therein, that not the
order of the reading, but the order of the discourse, must be
understood.  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p15"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p15.1"></span>19. “And
the temple of God was opened which is in heaven.”\] The temple opened is
a manifestation of our Lord. For the temple of God is the Son, as He
Himself says: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up.” And when the Jews said, “Forty and six years was this temple in
building,” the evangelist says, “He spake of the temple of His
body.” <span id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p17"></span>“And there was seen in His temple the ark
of the Lord’s testament.”\] The preaching of the Gospel and the
forgiveness of sins, and all the gifts whatever that came with Him, he
says, appeared therein.
