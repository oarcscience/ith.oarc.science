### <span id="iii.vi.i-p1.1"></span>The Phœnix

##### <span id="iii.vi.i-p1.2"></span><span id="iii.vi.i-p1.3"></span>By an Uncertain Author. Attributed to <span id="iii.vi.i-p1.4"></span>Lactantius  <span id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md)

<span id="iii.vi.i-p3"></span><span id="iii.vi.i-p3.1"></span>There is a
happy spot, retired <span id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011.md) in the
first East, where the great gate of the eternal pole lies open. It is
not, however, situated near to his rising in summer or in winter, but
where the sun pours the day from his vernal chariot. There a plain
spreads its open tracts; nor does any mound rise, nor hollow valley
open <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012.md) itself. But through
twice six ells that place rises above the mountains, whose tops are
thought to be lofty among us. Here is the grove of the sun; a wood
stands planted with many a tree, blooming with the honour of perpetual
foliage. When the pole had blazed with the fires of Phaethon, that place
was uninjured by the flames; and when the deluge had immersed the world
in waves, it rose above the waters of Deucalion. No enfeebling diseases,
no sickly old age, nor cruel death, nor harsh fear, approaches hither,
nor dreadful crime, nor mad desire of riches, nor <span
id="iii.vi.i-p5.2"></span>Mars, nor fury, burning with the love of
slaughter. <span id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013.md) Bitter grief is
absent, and want clothed in rags, and sleepless cares, and violent
hunger. No tempest rages there, nor dreadful violence of the wind; nor
does the hoar-frost cover the earth with cold dew. No cloud extends its
fleecy <span id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md) covering above the
plains, nor does the turbid moisture of water fall from on high; but
there is a fountain in the middle, which they call by the name of
“living;” <span id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015.md) it is clear,
gentle, and abounding with sweet waters, which, bursting forth once
during the space of each <span id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016.md)
month, twelve times irrigates all the grove with waters. Here a species
of tree, rising with lofty stem, bears mellow fruits not about to fall
on the ground. This grove, these woods, a single <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) bird, the phœnix, inhabits,—single,
but it lives reproduced by its own death. It obeys and submits <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018.md) to Phœbus, a remarkable attendant.
Its parent nature has given it to possess this office. When at its first
rising the saffron morn grows red, when it puts to flight the stars with
its rosy light, thrice and four times she plunges her body into the
sacred waves, thrice and four times she sips water from the living
stream. <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md) She is raised aloft,
and takes her seat on the highest top of the lofty tree, which alone
looks down upon the whole grove; and turning herself to the fresh
risings of the nascent Phœbus, she awaits his rays and rising beam. And
when the sun has thrown back the threshold of the shining gate, and the
light gleam <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md) of the first
light has shone forth, she begins to pour strains of sacred song, and to
hail <span id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md) the new light with
wondrous voice, which neither the notes of the nightingale <span
id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) nor the flute of the Muses can
equal with Cyrrhæan <span id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md) strains.
But neither is it thought that the dying swan can imitate it, nor the
tuneful strings of the lyre of <span id="iii.vi.i-p16.3"></span>Mercury.
After that Phœbus has brought back his horses to the open heaven, <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md) and continually advancing, has
displayed <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md) his whole orb; she
applauds with thrice-repeated flapping of her wings, and having thrice
adored the fire-bearing head, is silent. And she also distinguishes the
swift hours by sounds not liable to error by day and night: an
overseer <span id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) of the groves, a
venerable priestess of the wood, and alone admitted to thy secrets, O
Phœbus. And when she has <span id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span
id="iii.vi.i-Page_325"></span>now accomplished the thousand years of her
life, and length of days has rendered her burdensome, <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) in order that she may renew the age
which has glided by, the fates pressing <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) her, she flees from the beloved
couch of the accustomed grove. And when she has left the sacred places,
through a desire of being born <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) again, then she seeks this world,
where death reigns. Full of years, she directs her swift flight into
Syria, to which <span id="iii.vi.i-p22.2"></span>Venus herself has given
the name of Phœnice; <span id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md) and
through trackless deserts she seeks the retired groves in the place,
where a remote wood lies concealed through the glens. Then she chooses a
lofty palm, with top reaching to the heavens, which has the
pleasing <span id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) name of phœnix from
the bird, and where <span id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) no
hurtful living creature can break through, or slimy serpent, or any bird
of prey. Then Æolas shuts in the winds in hanging caverns, lest they
should injure the bright <span id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) air
with their blasts, or lest a cloud collected by the south wind through
the empty sky should remove the rays of the sun, and be a
hindrance <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) to the bird.
Afterwards she builds for herself either a nest or a tomb, for she
perishes that she may live; yet she produces herself. Hence she collects
juices and odours, which the Assyrian gathers from the rich wood, which
the wealthy Arabian gathers; which either the Pygmæan <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) nations, or India crops, or the
Sabæan land produces from its soft bosom. Hence she heaps together
cinnamon and the odour of the far-scented amomum, and balsams with mixed
leaves. Neither the twig of the mild cassia nor of the fragrant acanthus
is absent, nor the tears and rich drop of frankincense. To these she
adds tender ears <span id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) of
flourishing spikenard, and joins the too pleasing pastures <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) of myrrh. Immediately she places
her body about to be changed on the strewed nest, and her quiet limbs on
such <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) a couch. Then with her
mouth she scatters juices around and upon her limbs, about to die with
her own funeral rites. Then amidst various odours she yields up <span
id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) her life, nor fears the faith of so
great a deposit. In the meantime her body, destroyed by death, which
proves the source of life, <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) is
hot, and the heat itself produces a flame; and it conceives fire afar
off from the light of heaven: it blazes, and is dissolved into burnt
ashes. And these ashes collected in death it fuses, <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) as it were, into a mass, and has an
effect <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) resembling seed. From
this an animal is said to arise without limbs, but the worm is said to
be of a milky colour. And it suddenly increases vastly with an
imperfectly formed <span id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) body, and
collects itself into the appearance of a well-rounded egg. After this it
is formed again, such as its figure was before, and the phœnix, having
burst her shell, <span id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) shoots
forth, even as caterpillars <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md)
in the fields, when they are fastened by a thread to a stone, are wont
to be changed into a butterfly. No food is appointed for her in our
world, nor does any one make it his business to feed her while
unfledged. She sips the delicate <span
id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) ambrosial dews of heavenly nectar
which have fallen from the star-bearing pole. She gathers these; with
these the bird is nourished in the midst of odours, until she bears a
natural form. But when she begins to flourish with early youth, she
flies forth now about to return to her native abode. Previously,
however, she encloses in an ointment of balsam, and in myrrh and
dissolved <span id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md) frankincense, all
the remains of her own body, and the bones or ashes, and relics <span
id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048.md) of herself, and with pious mouth
brings it into a round form, <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md)
and carrying this with her feet, she goes to the rising of the sun, and
tarrying at the altar, she draws it forth in the sacred temple. She
shows and presents herself an object of admiration to the beholder; such
great beauty is there, such great honour abounds. In the first place,
her colour is like the brilliancy <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md) of that which the seeds of the
pomegranate when ripe take under the smooth rind; <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md) such colour as is contained in the
leaves which the poppy produces in the fields, when <span
id="iii.vi.i-p44.3"></span>Flora spreads her garments beneath the
blushing sky. Her shoulders and beautiful breasts shine with this
covering; with this her head, with this her neck, and the upper parts of
her back shine. And her tail is extended, varied with yellow metal, in
the spots of which mingled purple blushes. Between her wings there is a
bright <span id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) mark above, as <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) <span
id="iii.vi.i-p46.3"></span>Tris on high is wont to paint a cloud from
above. She gleams resplendent with a mingling of the green emerald, and
a shining beak <span id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) of pure horn
opens itself. Her eyes are large; <span
id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md) you might <span id="page_326">p.
326</span> <span id="iii.vi.i-Page_326"></span>believe that they were
two jacinths; <span id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) from the middle
of which a bright flame shines. An irradiated crown is fitted <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md) to the whole of her head,
resembling on high the glory of the head of Phœbus. <span
id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058.md) Scales cover her thighs spangled
with yellow metal, but a rosy <span id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md)
colour paints her claws with honour. Her form is seen to blend the
figure of the peacock with that of the painted bird of Phasis. <span
id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md) The winged creature which is
produced in the lands of the Arabians, whether it be beast or bird, can
scarcely equal her magnitude. <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md)
She is not, however, slow, as birds which through the greatness of their
body have sluggish motions, and a very heavy <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md) weight. But she is light and swift,
full of royal beauty. Such she always shows herself <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md) in the sight of men. Egypt comes
hither to such a wondrous <span id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md)
sight, and the exulting crowd salutes the rare bird. Immediately they
carve her image on the consecrated marble, and mark both the occurrence
and the day with a new title. Birds of every kind assemble together;
none is mindful of prey, none of fear. Attended by a chorus of birds,
she flies through the heaven, and a crowd accompanies her, exulting in
the pious duty. But when she has arrived at the regions of pure ether,
she presently returns; <span id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md)
afterwards she is concealed in her own regions. But oh, bird of happy
lot and fate, <span id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md) to whom the god
himself granted to be born from herself! Whether it be female, or male,
or neither, or both, happy she, who enters into <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) no compacts of <span
id="iii.vi.i-p60.4"></span>Venus. Death is <span
id="iii.vi.i-p60.5"></span>Venus to her; her only pleasure is in death:
that she may be born, she desires previously to die. She is an offspring
to herself, her own father and heir, her own nurse, and always a
foster-child to herself. She is herself indeed, but not the same, since
she is herself, and not herself, having gained eternal life by the
blessing of death. <span id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span
