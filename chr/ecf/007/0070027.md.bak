<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chap. xxi.—of certain deities peculiar to barbarians, and their sacred rites; and in like manner concerning the romans.

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1"></span>We have spoken of the gods themselves
who are worshipped; we must now speak a few words respecting their
sacrifices and mysteries. Among the people of Cyprus, <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.1"></span>Teucer sacrificed a human victim to <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.2"></span>Jupiter, and handed down to posterity
that sacrifice which was lately abolished by <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.3"></span>Hadrian when he was emperor. There was a
law among the people of Tauris, a fierce and inhuman nation, <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.4"></span>by which it was ordered that strangers
should be sacrificed to <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.5"></span>Diana; and
this sacrifice was practised through many ages. The Gauls used to
appease <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.6"></span>Hesus and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.7"></span>Teutas with human blood. Nor, indeed,
were the Latins free from this cruelty, since <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.8"></span>Jupiter Latialis is even now worshipped
with the offering of human blood. What benefit do they who offer such
sacrifices implore from the gods? Or what are such deities able to
bestow on the men by whose punishments they are propitiated? But this is
not so much a matter of surprise with respect to barbarians, whose
religion agrees with their character. But are not our countrymen, who
have always claimed for themselves the glory of gentleness and
civilization, found to be more inhuman by these sacrilegious rites? For
these ought rather to be esteemed impious, who, though they are
embellished with the pursuits of liberal training, turn aside from such
refinement, than those who, being ignorant and inexperienced, glide into
evil practices from their ignorance of those which are good. And yet it
is plain that this rite of immolating human victims is ancient, since
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.9"></span>Saturn was honoured in Latium with
the same kind of sacrifice; not indeed that a man was slain at the
altar, but that he was thrown from the Milvian bridge into the Tiber.
And <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.10"></span>Varro relates that this was
done in accordance with an oracle; of which oracle the last verse is to
this effect: “And offer heads to <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p1.11"></span>Ades, and to the father a man.” <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) And because this appears ambiguous, both
a torch and a man are accustomed to be thrown to him. But it is said
that sacrifices of this kind were put an end to by <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p2.6"></span>Hercules when he returned from Spain; the
custom still continuing, that instead of real men, images made from
rushes were cast forth, as <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p2.7"></span>Ovid
informs us in his <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p2.8"></span>Fasti: <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) “Until the Tirynthian <span
id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-Page_35"></span>came
into these lands, gloomy sacrifices were annually offered in the
Leucadian manner: he threw into the water Romans made of straw; do you,
after the example of <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p3.1"></span>Hercules,
cast <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) in the images of human
bodies.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p5"></span>The Vestal virgins make these sacred
offerings, as the same poet says: <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md)
“Then also a virgin is accustomed to cast from the wooden bridge the
images of ancient men made from rushes.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p7"></span>For I cannot find language to speak
of the infants who were immolated to the same <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p7.1"></span>Saturn, on account of his hatred of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p7.2"></span>Jupiter. To think that men were so
barbarous, so savage, that they gave the name of sacrifice to the
slaughter of their own children, that is, to a deed foul, and to be held
in detestation by the human race; since, without any regard to parental
affection, they destroyed tender and innocent lives, at an age which is
especially pleasing to parents, and surpassed in brutality the
savageness of all beasts, which—savage as they are—still love their
offspring! O incurable madness! What more could those gods do to them,
if they were most angry, than they now do when propitious, when they
defile their worshippers with parricide, visit them with bereavements,
and deprive them of the sensibilities of men? What can be sacred to
these men? Or what will they do in profane places, who commit the
greatest crimes amidst the altars of the gods? <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p7.3"></span>Pescennius Festus relates in the books of
his History by a Satire, that the Carthaginians were accustomed to
immolate human victims to <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p7.4"></span>Saturn;
and when they were conquered by <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p7.5"></span>Agathocles, the king of the Sicilians,
they imagined that the god was angry with them; and therefore, that they
might more diligently offer an expiation, they immolated two hundred
sons of their nobles: “So great the ills to which religion could prompt,
which has ofttimes produced wicked and impious deeds.” What advantage,
then, did the men propose by that sacrifice, when they put to death so
large a part of the state, as not even <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p7.6"></span>Agathocles had slain when victorious?  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p8"></span>From this kind of sacrifices those
public rites are to be judged <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p8.1"></span>signs
of no less madness; some of which are in honour of the mother of the
gods, in which men mutilate themselves; others are in honour of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p8.2"></span>Virtus, whom they also call <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p8.3"></span>Bellona, in which the priests make
offsprings not with the blood of another victim, but with their
own. <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) For, cutting their shoulders,
and thrusting forth drawn swords in each hand, they run, they are beside
themselves, they are frantic. <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.2"></span>Quintilian therefore says excellently in
his <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.3"></span>Fanatic: “If a god compels
this, he does it in anger.” Are even these things sacred? Is it not
better to live like cattle, than to worship deities so impious, profane,
and sanguinary? But we will discuss at the proper time the source from
which these errors and deeds of such great disgrace originated. In the
meantime, let us look also to other matters which are without guilt,
that we may not seem to select the worse parts through the desire of
finding fault. In Egypt there are sacred rites in honour of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.4"></span>Isis, since she either lost or found her
little son. For at first her priests, having made their bodies smooth,
beat their breasts, and lament, as the goddess herself had done when her
child was lost. Afterwards the boy is brought forward, as if found, and
that mourning is changed into joy. Therefore <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.5"></span>Lucan says, “And <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.6"></span>Osiris never sufficiently sought for.”
For they always lose, and they always find him. Therefore in the sacred
rites there is a representation of a circumstance which really occurred;
and which assuredly declares, if we have any intelligence, that she was
a mortal woman, and almost desolate, had she not found one person. And
this did not escape the notice of the poet himself; for he represents
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.7"></span>Pompey when a youth as thus
speaking, on hearing the death of his father: “I will now draw forth the
deity <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.8"></span>Isis from the tomb, <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.9"></span>and send her through the nations; and I
will scatter through the people <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.10"></span>Osiris covered with wood.” This <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.11"></span>Osiris is the same whom the people call
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.12"></span>Serapis. For it is customary for
the names of the dead who are deified to be changed, that no one, as I
believe, may imagine them to be men. For <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.13"></span>Romulus after his death became <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.14"></span>Quirinus, and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.15"></span>Leda became <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.16"></span>Nemesis, and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.17"></span>Circe <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.18"></span>Marica; and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.19"></span>Ino, when she had leapt into the sea,
was called <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.20"></span>Leucothea; and the
mother <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.21"></span>Matuta; and her son <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.22"></span>Melicerta was called <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.23"></span>Palæmon and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.24"></span>Portumnus. And the sacred rites of the
Eleusinian <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.25"></span>Ceres are not unlike
these. For as in those <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.26"></span>which have
been mentioned the boy <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.27"></span>Osiris is
sought with the wailing of his mother, so in these <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.28"></span>Proserpine is carried away to contract
an incestuous marriage with her uncle; and because <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p9.29"></span>Ceres is said to have sought for her in
Sicily with torches lighted from the top of Etna, on this account her
sacred rites are celebrated with the throwing of torches.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p10"></span>At Lampsacus the victim to he
offered to <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p10.1"></span>Priapus is an ass, and
the cause of the sacrifice of this animal is thus set forth in the <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p10.2"></span>Fasti:—When all the deities had
assembled at the festival of the Great Mother, and when, satiated with
feasting, they were spending the night in sport, they say that <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p10.3"></span>Vesta had laid herself on the ground for
rest, and had fallen asleep, and that <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p10.4"></span>Priapus upon this formed a design
against her honour as she slept; but that she was aroused by the
unseasonable braying of the ass on which <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p10.5"></span>Silenus used to ride, and that the
design of the insidious <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-Page_36"></span>plotter was frustrated. On this
account they say that the people of Lampsacus were accustomed to
sacrifice an ass to <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p10.6"></span>Priapus, as
though it were in revenge; but among the Romans the same animal was
crowned at the Vestalia (festival of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p10.7"></span>Vesta) with loaves, <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) in honour of the preservation of her
chastity. What is baser, what more disgraceful, than if <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p11.1"></span>Vesta is indebted to an ass for the
preservation of her purity? But the poet invented a fable. But was that
more true which is related by those <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md)
who wrote “Phenomena,” when they speak concerning the two stars of
Cancer, which the Greeks call asses? That they were asses which carried
across father <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p12.2"></span>Liber when he was
unable to cross a river, and that he rewarded one of them with the power
of speaking with human voice; and that a contest arose between him and
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p12.3"></span>Priapus; and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p12.4"></span>Priapus, being worsted <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p12.5"></span>in the contest, was enraged, and slew
the victor. This truly is much more absurd. But poets have the licence
of saying what they will. I do not meddle with a mystery so odious; nor
do I strip <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p12.6"></span>Priapus of his
disguise, lest something deserving of ridicule should be brought to
light. It is true the poets invented these fictions, but they must have
been invented for the purpose of concealing some greater depravity. Let
us inquire what this is. But in fact it is evident. For as the bull is
sacrificed to Luna, <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) because he also
has horns as she has; and as “Persia propitiates with a horse <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p13.1"></span>Hyperion surrounded with rays, that a
slow victim may not be offered to the swift god;” so in this case no
more suitable victim could be found than that which resembled him to
whom it is offered.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p14"></span>At Lindus, which is a town of
Rhodes, there are sacred rites in honour of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p14.1"></span>Hercules, the observance of which
differs widely from all other rites; for they are not celebrated with
words of good omen <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) (as the Greeks
term it), but with revilings and cursing. And they consider it a
violation of the sacred rites, if at any time during the celebration of
the solemnities a good word shall have escaped from any one even
inadvertently. And this is the reason assigned for this practice, if
indeed there can be any reason in things utterly senseless. When <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p15.9"></span>Hercules had arrived at the place, and
was suffering hunger, he saw a ploughman at work, and began to ask him
to sell one of his oxen. But the ploughman replied that this was
impossible, because his hope of cultivating the land depended altogether
upon those two bullocks. <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p15.10"></span>Hercules, with his usual violence,
because he was not able to receive one of them, killed both. But the
unhappy man, when he saw that his oxen were slain, avenged the injury
with revilings,—a circumstance which afforded gratification to the man
of elegance and refinement. For while he prepares a feast for his
companions, and while he devours the oxen of another man, he receives
with ridicule and loud laughter the bitter reproaches with which the
other assails him. But when it had been determined that divine honours
should be paid to <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p15.11"></span>Hercules in
admiration of his excellence, an altar was erected in his honour by the
citizens, which he named, from the circumstance, the yoke of oxen; <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) and at this altar two yoked oxen were
sacrificed, like those which he had taken from the ploughman. And he
appointed the same man to be his priest, and directed him always to use
the same revilings in offering sacrifice, because he said that he had
never feasted more pleasantly. Now these things are not sacred, but
sacrilegious, in which that is said to be enjoined, which, if it is done
in other things, is punished with the greatest severity. What, moreover,
do the rites of the Cretan <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p16.2"></span>Jupiter
himself show, except the manner in which he was withdrawn from his
father, or brought up? There is a goat belonging to the nymph <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p16.3"></span>Amalthea, which gave suck to the infant;
and of this goat <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p16.4"></span>Germanicus Cæsar
thus speaks, in his poem translated from Aratus: <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p17.9"></span> “She is supposed to be the
> nurse of <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p17.11"></span>Jupiter; if in truth
> the infant <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p17.12"></span>Jupiter pressed the
> faithful teats of the Cretan goat, which attests the gratitude of her
> lord by a bright constellation.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p18"></span><span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p18.1"></span>Musæus relates that <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p18.2"></span>Jupiter, when fighting against the
Titans, used the hide of this goat as a shield, from which circumstance
he is called by the poets shield-bearer. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) Thus, whatever was done in concealing the
boy, that also is done by way of representation in the sacred rites.
Moreover, the mystery of his mother also contains the same <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p19.3"></span>story which <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p19.4"></span>Ovid sets forth in the <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p19.5"></span>Fasti:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p19.6"></span> “Now the lofty <span
> id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p19.8"></span>Ida resounds with tinklings, that the
> boy may cry in safety with infant mouth. Some strike their shields
> with stakes, some beat their empty helmets. This is the employment of
> the Curetes, this of the Corybantes. The matter was concealed, and
> imitations of the ancient deed remain; the attendant goddesses shake
> instruments of brass, and hoarse hides. Instead of helmets they strike
> cymbals, and drums instead of shields; the flute gives Phrygian
> strains, as it gave before.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p20"></span>Sallust rejected this opinion
altogether, as though invented by the poets, and wished to give an
ingenious explanation of the reasons for <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-Page_37"></span>which the Curetes are said to
have nourished <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p20.1"></span>Jupiter; and he
speaks to this purport: Because they were the first to understand the
worship of the deity, that therefore antiquity, which exaggerates all
things, made them known as the nourishers of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p20.2"></span>Jupiter. How much this learned man was
mistaken, the matter itself at once declares. For if <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p20.3"></span>Jupiter holds the first place, both
among the gods and in religious rites, if no gods were worshipped by the
people before him, because they who are worshipped were not yet born; it
appears that the Curetes, on the contrary, were the first who did not
understand the worship of the deity, since all error was introduced by
them, and the memory of the true God was taken away. They ought
therefore to have understood from the mysteries and ceremonies
themselves, that they were offering prayers to dead men. I do not then
require that any one should believe the fictions of the poets. If any
one imagines that these speak falsely, let him consider the writings of
the pontiffs themselves, and weigh whatever there is of literature
pertaining to sacred rites: he will perhaps find more things than we
bring forward, from which he may understand that all things which are
esteemed sacred are empty, vain, and fictitious. But if any one, having
discovered wisdom, shall lay aside his error, he will assuredly laugh at
the follies of men who are almost without understanding: I mean those
who either dance with unbecoming gestures, or run naked, anointed, and
crowned with chaplets, either wearing a mask or besmeared with mud. What
shall I say about shields now putrid with age? When they carry these,
they think that they are carrying gods themselves on their shoulders.
For <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p20.4"></span>Furius Bibaculus is regarded
among the chief examples of piety, who, though he was prætor,
nevertheless carried the sacred shield, <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) preceded by the lictors, though his
office <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p21.4"></span>as <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p21.5"></span>prœtor gave him an exemption from this
duty. He was therefore not Furius, but altogether mad, <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) who thought that he graced his
prætorship by this service. Deservedly then, since these things are done
by men not unskilful and ignorant, does <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p22.1"></span>Lucretius exclaim:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p22.2"></span> “O foolish minds of men! O
> blinded breasts! In what darkness of life and in how great dangers is
> passed this term of life, whatever be its duration!”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxii-p23"></span>Who that is possessed of any sense
would not laugh at these mockeries, when he sees that men, as though
bereft of intelligence, do those things seriously, which if any one
should do in sport, he would appear too full of sport and folly?
