<span id="iii.ii.vi.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chap. IV.—Of the Ways of Life, of Pleasures, Also of the Hardships of Christians.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.iv-p1"></span>There is one way, therefore, of virtue
and the good, which leads, not, as the poets say, to the Elysian plains,
but to the very citadel of the world:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span> “The left gives sinners up to
> pain,  
> And leads to Tartarus’ guilty reign.” <span
> id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.iv-p3"></span>For it belongs to that accuser who,
having invented false religions, turns men away from the heavenly path,
and leads them into the way of perdition. And the appearance and shape
of this way is so composed to the sight, that it appears to be level and
open, and delightful with all kinds of flowers and fruits. For there are
placed <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) in it all things which
are esteemed on earth as good things—I mean wealth, honour, repose,
pleasure, all kinds of enticements; but together with these also
injustice, cruelty, pride, perfidy, lust, avarice, discord, ignorance,
falsehood, folly, and other vices. But the end of this way is as
follows: When they have reached the point from which there is now no
return, it is so suddenly removed, together with all its beauty, that no
one is able to foresee the fraud before that he falls headlong into a
deep abyss. For whoever is captivated by the appearance of present
goods, and occupied with the pursuit and enjoyment of these, shall not
have foreseen the things which are about to follow after death, and
shall have turned aside from God; he truly will be cast down to hell,
and be condemned to eternal punishment.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.iv-p5"></span>But that heavenly way is set forth as
difficult and hilly, or rough with dreadful thorns, or entangled with
stones jutting out; so that every one must walk with the greatest labour
and wearing of the feet, and with great precautions against falling. In
this he has placed justice, temperance, patience, faith, chastity,
self-restraint, concord, knowledge, truth, wisdom, and the other
virtues; but together with these, poverty, ignominy, labour, pain, and
all kinds of hardship. For whoever has extended his hope beyond the
present, and chosen better things, will be without these earthly goods,
that, being lightly equipped and without impediment, he may overcome the
difficulty of the way. For it is impossible for him who has surrounded
himself with royal pomp, or loaded himself with riches, either to enter
upon or to persevere in these difficulties. And from this it is
understood that it is easier for the wicked and the unrighteous to
succeed in their desires, because their road is downward and on the
decline; but that it is difficult for the good to attain to their
wishes, because they walk along a difficult and steep path. Therefore
the righteous man, since he has entered upon a hard and rugged way, must
be an object of contempt, derision, and hatred. For all whom desire or
pleasure drags headlong, envy him who has been able to attain to virtue,
and take it ill that any one possesses that which they themselves do not
possess. Therefore he will be poor, humble, ignoble, subject to injury,
and yet enduring all things which are grievous; and if he shall continue
his patience unceasingly to that last step and end, the crown of virtue
will be given to him, and he will be rewarded by God with immortality
for the labours which he has endured in life for the sake of
righteousness. These are the ways which <span id="page_166">p.
166</span> <span id="iii.ii.vi.iv-Page_166"></span>God has assigned to
human life, in each of which he has shown both good and evil things, but
in a changed and inverted order. In the one he has pointed out in the
first place temporal evils followed by eternal goods, which is the
better order; in the other, first temporal goods followed by eternal
evils, which is the worse order: so that, whosoever has chosen present
evils together with righteousness, he will obtain greater and more
certain goods than those were which he despised; but whoever has
preferred present goods to righteousness, will fall into greater and
more lasting evils than those were which he avoided. For as this bodily
life is short, therefore its goods and evils must also be short; but
since that spiritual life, which is contrary to this earthly life, is
everlasting, therefore its goods and evils are also everlasting. Thus it
comes to pass, that goods of short duration are succeeded by eternal
evils, and evils of short duration by eternal goods.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.iv-p6"></span>Since, therefore, good and evil things
are set before man at the same time, it is befitting that every one
should consider with himself how much better it is to compensate evils
of short duration by perpetual goods, than to endure perpetual evils for
short and perishable goods. For as, in this life, when a contest with an
enemy is set before you, you must first labour that you may afterwards
enjoy repose, you must suffer hunger and thirst, you must endure heat
and cold, you must rest on the ground, must watch and undergo dangers,
that your children, <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) and
house, and property being preserved, you may be able to enjoy all the
blessings of peace and victory; but if you should choose present ease in
preference to labour, you must do yourself the greatest injury: for the
enemy will surprise you offering no resistance, your lands will be laid
waste, your house plundered, your wife and children become a prey, you
yourself will be slain or taken prisoner; to prevent the occurrence of
these things, present advantage must be put aside, that a greater and
more lasting advantage may be gained;—so in the whole of this life,
because God has provided an adversary for us, that we might be able to
acquire virtue, present gratification must be laid aside, lest the enemy
should overpower us. We must be on the watch, must post guards, must
undertake military expeditions, must shed our blood to the uttermost; in
short, we must patiently submit to all things which are unpleasant and
grievous, and the more readily because God our commander has appointed
for us eternal rewards for our labours. And since in this earthly
warfare men expend so much labour to acquire for themselves those things
which may perish in the same manner as that in which they were acquired,
assuredly no labour ought to be refused by us, by whom that is gained
which can in no way be lost.  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.iv-p8"></span>For God, who created men to this
warfare, desired that they should stand prepared in battle array, and
with minds keenly intent should watch against the stratagems or open
attacks of our single enemy, who, as is the practice of skilful and
experienced generals, endeavours to ensnare us by various arts,
directing his rage according to the nature and disposition of each. For
he infuses into some insatiable avarice, that, being chained by their
riches as by fetters, he may drive them from the way of truth. He
inflames others with the excitement of anger, that while they are rather
intent upon inflicting injury, he may turn them aside from the
contemplation of God. He plunges others into immoderate lusts, that,
giving themselves to pleasure of the body, they may be unable to look
towards virtue. He inspires others with envy, that, being occupied with
their own torments, they may think of nothing but the happiness of those
whom they hate. He causes others to swell with ambitious desires. These
are they who direct the whole occupation and care of their life to the
holding of magistracies, that they may set a mark upon the annals, <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) and give a name to the years. The
desire of others mounts higher, not that they may rule provinces with
the temporal sword, but with boundless and perpetual power may wish to
be called lords of the whole human race. <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) Moreover, those whom he has seen to
be pious he involves in various <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md) superstitions, that he may make
them impious. But to those who seek for wisdom, he dashes philosophy
before their eyes, <span id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md) that he
may blind them with the appearance of light, lest any one should grasp
and hold fast the truth. Thus he has blocked up all the approaches
against men, and has occupied the way, rejoicing in public errors; but
that we might be able to dispel these errors, and to overcome the author
of evils himself, God has enlightened us, and has armed us with true and
heavenly virtue, respecting which I must now speak.

was Archon Eponymus, giving name to the year; and at Rome, the year was
reckoned by the names of the consuls then in office.
