#### <span id="iii.v.xx-p0.1"></span>Chap. XX.

<span id="iii.v.xx-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Galerius
having effected the expulsion of the two old men, began to consider
himself alone as the sovereign of the Roman empire. Necessity had
required the appointment of <span id="iii.v.xx-p1.2"></span>Constantius
to the first rank; but <span id="iii.v.xx-p1.3"></span>Galerius made
small account of one who was of an easy temper, and of health declining
and precarious. He looked for the speedy death of <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.4"></span>Constantius. And although that prince should
recover, it seemed not difficult to force him to put off the imperial
purple; for what else could he do, if pressed by his three colleagues to
abdicate? <span id="iii.v.xx-p1.5"></span>Galerius had <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.6"></span>Licinius ever about his person, his old and
intimate acquaintance, and his earliest companion in arms, whose
counsels he used in the management of all affairs; yet he would not
nominate Licinius to the dignity of <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.7"></span>Cæsar, with the title of <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.8"></span>son, for he purposed to nominate him, in the
room of <span id="iii.v.xx-p1.9"></span>Constantius, to the dignity of
<span id="iii.v.xx-p1.10"></span>emperor, with the title of <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.11"></span>brother, while he himself might hold
sovereign authority, and rule over the whole globe with unbounded
licence. After that, he meant to have solemnized the <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.12"></span>vicennial festival; to have conferred on his
son <span id="iii.v.xx-p1.13"></span>Candidianus, then a boy of nine
years of age, the office of <span id="iii.v.xx-p1.14"></span>Cæsar; and,
in conclusion, to have resigned, as <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.15"></span>Diocletian had done. And thus, <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.16"></span>Licinius and <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.17"></span>Severus being emperors, and <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.18"></span>Maximin and <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.19"></span>Candidianus in the next station of <span
id="iii.v.xx-p1.20"></span>Cæsars, he fancied that, environed as it were
by an impregnable wall, he should lead an old age of security and peace.
Such were his projects; but God, whom he had made his adversary,
frustrated all those imaginations.
