#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XI.—The Various Emblems Under Which the Poets Veiled the Turpitude of Jupiter.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xii-p1"></span>But some one will say that these
things are feigned by the poets. This is not the usage of the poets, to
feign in such a manner that you fabricate the whole, but so that you
cover the actions themselves with a figure, and, as it were, with a
variegated veil. Poetic licence has this limit, not that it may invent
the whole, which is the part of one who is false and senseless, but that
it may change something consistently with reason. They said that <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Jupiter changed himself into a shower
of gold, that he might deceive <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xii-p1.2"></span>Danae. What is a shower of gold?
Plainly golden coins, by offering a great quantity of which, and pouring
them into her bosom, he corrupted the frailty of her virgin soul by this
bribe. Thus also they speak of a shower of iron, when they wish to
signify a multitude of javelins. He carried off his catamite upon an
eagle. What is the eagle? Truly a legion, since the figure of this
animal is the standard of the legion. He carried <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xii-p1.3"></span>Europa across the sea on a bull. What
is the bull? Clearly a ship, which had its tutelary image <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) fashioned in the shape of a bull.
So assuredly the daughter of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xii-p2.2"></span>Inachus was not turned into a cow, nor
as such did she swim across, but she escaped the anger of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xii-p2.3"></span>Juno in a ship which had the form of a
cow. Lastly, when she had been conveyed to Egypt, she became <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xii-p2.4"></span>Isis, whose voyage is celebrated on a
fixed day, in memory of her flight.

supposed to be the tutelary guardian of the ship, was usually painted on
the stern.
