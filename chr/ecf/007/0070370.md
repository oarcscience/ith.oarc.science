#### <span id="v.i-p1.1"></span> Introductory Notice

<span id="v.i-p2"></span> \[<span id="v.i-p2.1"></span>Circa <span
id="v.i-p2.2"></span>a.d. 232\] Finding these fragments relegated, by
the Edinburgh editors, to a place (unaccountably chosen) among the
spurious Decretals <span id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152) and
dismissed as of dubious character, it looked as if modern light had been
shed upon this author, and as if he had better, perhaps, be classed with
the apocryphal works of our concluding volume. But, after considerable
inquiry, I see no reason to dismiss <span id="v.i-p3.1"></span>Asterius
from the respectable position assigned him by <span
id="v.i-p3.2"></span>Lardner; <span id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153)
and I now wish I had appended these fragments to those of the Roman
presbyter <span id="v.i-p4.2"></span>Caius, to which the reader is
referred. <span id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154) It is true, <span
id="v.i-p5.4"></span>Lardner is quite undecided as to this author,
though he accepts <span id="v.i-p5.5"></span>Tillemont’s conjecture as
probable; viz., that the <span id="v.i-p5.6"></span>Asterius Urbanus
mentioned by <span id="v.i-p5.7"></span>Eusebius is the author of the
fragments, and that his work against the Montanists was written in the
eleventh year of the Emperor <span id="v.i-p5.8"></span>Alexander, <span
id="v.i-p5.9"></span>circa 232. It is doubtful whether the author was a
presbyter or a bishop. On some occasions he seems to have been at Ancyra
in Galatia, where he reluctantly consented to write is treatise at the
solicitation of the presbytery there, and particularly of Abercius <span
id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155) <span
id="v.i-p6.4"></span>Marcellus, to whom it is inscribed.  

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>The translator is not named, but here follows
the very unsatisfactory preface of the Edinburgh edition:—  

<span id="v.i-p8"></span>  

<span id="v.i-p9"></span><span id="v.i-p9.1"></span>Nothing is known of
<span id="v.i-p9.2"></span>Asterius Urbanus. The name occurs in Fragment
IV.; <span id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156) and from the allusion
made to him there, some have inferred that he was the author of the work
against Montanists, from which <span id="v.i-p10.3"></span>Eusebius has
made these extracts. The inference is unfounded. There is no clue to the
authorship. It has been attributed by different critics to <span
id="v.i-p10.4"></span>Apollinaris, <span
id="v.i-p10.5"></span>Apollonius, and <span
id="v.i-p10.6"></span>Rhodon.
