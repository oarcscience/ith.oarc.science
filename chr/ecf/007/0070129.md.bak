<span id="iii.ii.v.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.v.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVI.—Of the Duties of the Just Man, and the Equity of Christians.

<span id="iii.ii.v.xvi-p1"></span>Therefore, since those two fountains
of justice are changed, all virtue and all truth are taken away, and
justice itself returns to heaven. And on this account the true good was
not discovered by philosophers, because they were ignorant both of its
origin and effects: which has been revealed to no others but to our
people. <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028.md) Some one will say,
Are there not among you some poor, and others rich; some servants, and
others masters? Is there not some difference between individuals? There
is none; nor is there any other cause why we mutually bestow upon each
other the name of brethren, except that we believe ourselves to be
equal. For since we measure all human things not by the body, but by the
spirit, although the condition of bodies is different, yet we have no
servants, but we both regard and speak of them as brothers in spirit, in
religion as fellow-servants. Riches also do not render men illustrious,
except that <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029.md) they are able to
make them more conspicuous by good works. For men are rich, not because
they possess riches, but because they employ them on works of justice;
and they who seem to be poor, on this account are rich, because they are
not <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) in want, and desire
nothing.  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xvi-p5"></span>Though, therefore, in lowliness of
mind we are on an equality, the free with slaves, and the rich with the
poor, nevertheless in the sight of God we are distinguished by virtue.
And every one is more elevated in proportion to his greater justice. For
if it is justice for a man to put himself on a level even with those of
lower rank, although he excels in this very thing, that he made himself
equal to his inferiors; yet if he has conducted himself not only as an
equal, but even as an inferior, he will plainly obtain a much higher
rank of dignity in the judgment of God. <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md) For assuredly, since all things in
this temporal life are frail and liable to decay, men both prefer
themselves to others, and contend about dignity; than which nothing is
more foul, nothing mere arrogant, nothing more removed from the conduct
of a wise man: for these earthly things are altogether opposed to
heavenly things. For as the wisdom of men is the greatest foolishness
with God, and foolishness is (as I have shown) the greatest wisdom; so
he is low and abject in the sight of God who shall have been conspicuous
and elevated on earth. For, not to mention that these present earthly
goods to which great honour is paid are contrary to virtue, and enervate
the vigour of the mind, what nobility, I pray, can be so firm, what
resources, what power, since God is able to make kings themselves even
lower than the lowest? And therefore God has consulted our interest in
placing this in particular among the divine precepts: “He that exalteth
himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be
exalted.” <span id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) And the
wholesomeness of this precept teaches that he who shall <span
id="iii.ii.v.xvi-p7.2"></span>simply place himself on a level with <span
id="iii.ii.v.xvi-p7.3"></span>other men, and carry himself with
humility, is esteemed excellent and illustrious in the sight of God. For
the sentiment is not false which is brought forward in <span
id="iii.ii.v.xvi-p7.4"></span>Euripides to this effect:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.xvi-p7.5"></span> “The things which are here
> considered evil are esteemed good in heaven.”
