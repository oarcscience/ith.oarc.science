<span id="iii.ii.i.xiii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. xii.—that the stoics transfer the figments of the poets to a philosophical system.

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1"></span>Since we have brought to light the
mysteries of the poets, and have found out the parents of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>Saturn, let us return to his virtues and
actions. He was, <span id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.2"></span>they say, just in
his rule. First, from this very circumstance he is not now a god,
inasmuch as he has ceased to be. In the next place, he was not even
just, but impious not only towards his sons, whom he devoured, but also
towards his father, whom he is said to have mutilated. And this may
perhaps have happened in truth. But men, having regard to the element
which is called the heaven, reject the whole fable as most foolishly
invented; though the Stoics, (according to their custom) endeavour to
transfer it to a physical system, whose opinion <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.3"></span>Cicero has laid down in his treatise
concerning the Nature of the Gods. They held, he says, that the highest
and ethereal nature of heaven, that is, of fire, which by itself
produced all things, was without that part of the body which contained
the productive organs. Now this theory might have been suitable to <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.4"></span>Vesta, if she were called a male. For it
is on this account that they esteem Vesta to be a virgin, inasmuch as
fire is an incorruptible element; and nothing can be born from it, since
it consumes all things, whatever it has seized upon. <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.5"></span>Ovid in the <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p1.6"></span>Fasti says: <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) “Nor do you esteem Vesta to be anything
else than a living flame; and you see no bodies produced from flame.
Therefore she is truly a virgin, for she sends forth no seed, nor
receives it, and loves the attendants of virginity.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3"></span>This also might have been ascribed to
<span id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.1"></span>Vulcan, who indeed is supposed to
be fire, and yet the poets did not mutilate him. It might also have been
ascribed to the sun, in whom is the nature and cause of the productive
powers. For without the fiery heat of the sun nothing could be born, or
have increase; so that no other element has greater need of productive
organs than heat, by the nourishment of which all things are conceived,
produced, and supported. Lastly, even if the case were as they would
have it, why should we suppose that <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.2"></span>Cœlus was mutilated, rather than that he
was born without productive organs? For if he produces by himself, it is
plain that he had no need of productive organs, since he gave birth to
<span id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.3"></span>Saturn himself; but if he had them,
and suffered mutilation from his son, the origin of all things and all
nature would have perished. Why should I say that they deprive Saturn
himself not only of divine, but also of human intelligence, when they
affirm that Saturn is he who comprises the course and change of the
spaces and seasons, and that he has that very <span id="page_25">p.
25</span> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiii-Page_25"></span>name in Greek? For he
is called <span id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.4"></span>Cronos, which is the same
as Chronos, that is, a space of time. But he is called Saturn, because
he is satiated with years. These are the words of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.5"></span>Cicero, setting forth the opinion of the
Stoics: “The worthlessness of these things any one may readily
understand. For if Saturn is the son of Cœlus, how could Time have been
born from Cœlus, or Cœlus have been mutilated by Time, or afterwards
could Time have been despoiled of his sovereignty by his son <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.6"></span>Jupiter? Or how was <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiii-p3.7"></span>Jupiter born from Time? Or with what
years could eternity be satiated, since it has no limit?” <span
