#### <span id="iii.iii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVI.—Of God, and His Anger and Affections.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p1"></span>Some one will ask what this substance
is. First of all, when evils befall them, men in their dejected state
for the most part have recourse to God: they appease and entreat Him,
believing that He is able to repel injuries from them. He has therefore
an occasion of exercising pity; for He is not so unmerciful and a
despiser of men as to refuse aid to those who are in distress. Very
many, also, who are persuaded that justice is pleasing to God, both
worship Him who is Lord and Parent of all, and with continual prayers
and repeated vows offer gifts and sacrifices, follow up His name with
praises, striving to gain His favour by just and good works. There is
therefore a reason, on account of which God may and ought to favour
them. For if there is nothing so befitting God as beneficence, and
nothing so unsuited to His character as to be ungrateful, it is
necessary that He should make some return for the services of those who
are excellent, and who lead a holy life, that He may not be liable to
the charge of ingratitude which is worthy of blame <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733.md) even in the case of <span
id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span id="iii.iii.xvi-Page_273"></span>a
man. But, on the contrary, others are daring <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734.md) and wicked, who pollute all things
with their lusts, harass with slaughters, practice fraud, plunder,
commit perjury, neither spare relatives nor parents, neglect the laws,
and even God Himself. Anger, therefore, has a befitting occasion <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) in God.  

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p5"></span>For it is not right that, when He sees
such things, He should not be moved, and arise to take vengeance upon
the wicked, and destroy the pestilent and guilty, so as to promote the
interests of all good men. Thus even in anger itself there is also
contained a showing of kindness. <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md) Therefore the arguments are found
to be empty and false, either of those who, when they will not admit
that God is angry, will have it that He shows kindness, because this,
indeed, cannot take place without anger; or of those who think that
there is no emotion of the mind in God. And because there are some
affections to which God is not liable, as desire, fear, avarice, grief,
and envy, they have said that He is entirely free from all affection.
For He is not liable to these, because they are vicious affections; but
as to those which belong to virtue,—that is, anger towards the wicked,
regard towards the good, pity towards the afflicted,—inasmuch as they
are worthy of the divine power, He has affections of His own, <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md) both just and true. And if He is
not possessed of them, the life of man will be thrown into confusion,
and the condition of things will come to such disturbance that the laws
will be despised and overpowered, and audacity alone reign, so that no
one can at length be in safety unless he who excels <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) in strength. Thus all the earth
will be laid waste, as it were, by a common robbery. But now, since the
wicked expect punishment, and the good hope for favour, and the
afflicted look for aid, there is place for virtues, and crimes are more
rare. But <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md) it is said,
ofttimes the wicked are more prosperous, and the good more wretched, and
the just are harassed with impunity by the unjust. We will hereafter
consider why these things happen. In the meantime let us explain
respecting anger, whether there be any in God; whether He takes no
notice at all, and is unmoved at those things which are done with
impiety.
