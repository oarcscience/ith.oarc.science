#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXIX.—Of Various Philosophers, and of the Antipodes.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1"></span>These things, truly, are of small
importance, but they arise from the same falsehood. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Xenophanes said that the orb of the
moon is eighteen times larger than this earth of ours; and that within
its compass is contained another earth, which is inhabited by men and
animals of every kind. About the antipodes also one can neither hear nor
speak without laughter. It is asserted as something serious, that we
should believe that there are men who have their feet opposite to ours.
The ravings of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1.2"></span>Anaxagoras are
more tolerable, who said that snow was black. And not only the sayings,
but the deeds, of some are ridiculous. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1.3"></span>Democritus neglected his land which
was left to him by his father, and suffered it to become a public
pasture. <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p1.4"></span>Diogenes with his
company of dogs, <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) who
professes that great and perfect virtue in the contempt of all things,
preferred to beg for his support, rather than to seek it by honest
labour, or to have any property. Undoubtedly the life of a wise man
ought to be to others an example of living. If all should imitate the
wisdom of these, how will states exist? But perhaps the same Cynics were
able to afford an example of modesty, who lived with their wives in
public. I know not how they could defend virtue, who took away modesty.
 

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3"></span>Nor was <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.1"></span>Aristippus better than these, who, I
believe, that he might please his mistress <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.2"></span>Lais, instituted the Cyrenaic system,
by which he placed the end of the chief good in bodily pleasure, that
authority might not be wanting to his faults, or learning to his vices.
Are those men of greater fortitude to be more approved, who, that they
might be said to have despised death, died by their own hands? <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.3"></span>Zeno, <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.4"></span>Empedocles, <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.5"></span>Chrysippus, <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.6"></span>Cleanthes, <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.7"></span>Democritus, and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxv-p3.8"></span>Cato, imitating these, did not know
that he who put himself to death is guilty of murder, according to the
divine right and law. For it was God who placed us in this abode of
flesh: it was He who gave us the temporary habitation of the body, that
we should inhabit it as long as He pleased. Therefore it is to be
considered impious, to wish to depart from it without the command of
God. Therefore violence must not be applied to nature. He knows how to
destroy <span id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) His own work. And if
any one shall apply impious hands to that work, and shall tear asunder
the bonds of the divine workmanship, he endeavours to flee from God,
whose sentence no one will be able to escape, whether alive or dead.
Therefore they are accursed and impious, whom I have mentioned above,
who even taught what are the befitting reasons for voluntary death; so
that it was not enough of guilt that they were self-murderers, unless
they instructed others also to this wickedness. <span
