#### <span id="iii.v.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXII.

<span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1"></span>Maximin <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Daia was incensed at the nomination of
<span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.2"></span>Licinius to the dignity of <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.3"></span>emperor, and he would no longer be called
<span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.4"></span>Cæsar, or allow himself to be ranked
as third in authority. <span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.5"></span>Galerius, by
repeated messages, besought <span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.6"></span>Daia to
yield, and to acquiesce in <span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.7"></span>his
arrangement, to give place to age, and to reverence the grey hairs of
<span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.8"></span>Licinius. But <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.9"></span>Daia became more and more insolent. He
urged that, as it was he who first assumed the purple, so, by
possession, he had right to priority in rank; and he set at nought the
entreaties and the injunctions of <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.10"></span>Galerius. That brute animal was stung to
the quick, and bellowed when the mean creature whom he had made <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.11"></span>Cæsar, in expectation of his thorough
obsequiousness, forgot the great favour conferred on him, and impiously
withstood the requests and will of his benefactor. <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.12"></span>Galerius at length, overcome by the
obstinacy of <span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.13"></span>Daia, abolished the
subordinate title of <span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.14"></span>Cæsar, gave to
himself and <span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.15"></span>Licinius that of <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.16"></span>the Augusti, and to <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.17"></span>Daia and <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.18"></span>Constantine that of <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.19"></span>sons of the Augusti. <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.20"></span>Daia, some time after, in a letter to
<span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.21"></span>Galerius, took occasion to observe,
that at the last general muster he had been saluted by his army under
the title of <span id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.22"></span>Augustus. <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.23"></span>Galerius, vexed and grieved at this,
commanded that all the four should have the appellation of <span
id="iii.v.xxxii-p1.24"></span>emperor. <span
