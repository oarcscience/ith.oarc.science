<span id="ix.ii.i"></span>

#### <span id="ix.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Sec. I.—General Commandments.

<span id="ix.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="ix.ii.i-p1.1"></span>The apostles
and elders to all those who from among the Gentiles have believed in the
Lord <span id="ix.ii.i-p1.2"></span>Jesus Christ; grace and peace from
Almighty God, through our Lord <span id="ix.ii.i-p1.3"></span>Jesus
Christ, be multiplied unto you in the acknowledgment of Him.  

<span id="ix.ii.i-p2"></span>The Catholic Church is the plantation of
God and His beloved vineyard; <span id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537.md)
containing those who have believed in His unerring divine religion; who
are the heirs by faith of His everlasting kingdom; who are partakers of
His divine influence, and of the communication of the Holy Spirit; who
are armed through <span id="ix.ii.i-p3.2"></span>Jesus, and have
received His fear into their hearts; who enjoy the benefit of the
sprinkling of the precious and innocent blood of Christ; who have free
liberty to call Almighty God, Father; being fellow-heirs and
joint-partakers of His beloved Son: hearken to this holy doctrine, you
who enjoy His promises, as being delivered by the command of your
Saviour, and agreeable to His glorious words. Take care, ye children of
God, to do all things in obedience to God; and in all things please
Christ our Lord. <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538.md) For if any
man follows unrighteousness, and does those things that are contrary to
the will of God, such a one will be esteemed by God as the disobedient
heathen.  

#### <span id="ix.ii.i-p4.2"></span>Concerning Covetousness.

<span id="ix.ii.i-p5"></span>I. Abstain, therefore, from all unlawful
desires and injustice. For it is written in the law, “Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his field, nor his man-servant, nor his
maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy
neighbour’s;” <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539.md) for all
coveting of these things is from the evil one. For he that covets his
neighbour’s wife, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, is already in
his mind an adulterer and a thief; and if he does not repent, is
condemned by our Lord <span id="ix.ii.i-p6.2"></span>Jesus Christ:
through whom <span id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540.md) glory be to God
for ever, Amen. For He says in the Gospel, recapitulating, and
confirming, and fulfilling the ten commandments of the law: “It is
written in the law, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you,
that is, I said in the law, by <span id="ix.ii.i-p7.2"></span>Moses. But
now I say unto you myself, Whosoever shall look on his neighbour’s wife
to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his
heart.” <span id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541.md) Such a one is
condemned of adultery, who covets his neighbour’s wife in his mind. But
does not he that covets an ox or an ass design to steal them? to apply
them to his own use, and to lead them away? Or, again, does not he that
covets a field, and continues in such a disposition, wickedly contrive
how to remove the landmarks, and to compel the possessor to part with
somewhat for nothing? For as the prophet somewhere speaks: “Woe to those
who join house to house, and lay field to field, that they may deprive
their neighbour of somewhat which was his.” <span
id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542.md) Wherefore he says: “Must you alone
inhabit the earth? For these things have been heard in the ears of the
Lord of hosts.” And elsewhere: “Cursed be he who removeth his
neighbour’s landmarks: and all the people shall say, Amen.” <span
id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543.md) Wherefore <span
id="ix.ii.i-p10.3"></span>Moses says: “Thou shalt not remove thy
neighbour’s landmarks <span id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544.md) <span
id="ix.ii.i-p11.2"></span>which thy fathers have set.” <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) Upon this account, therefore,
terrors, death, tribunals, and condemnations follow such as these from
God. But as to those who are obedient to God, there is one law of God,
<span id="ix.ii.i-p12.2"></span>simple, <span
id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md) true, living, which is this: “Do
not that to another which thou hatest another should do to thee.” <span
id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547.md) Thou <span id="page_392">p.
392</span> <span id="ix.ii.i-Page_392"></span>wouldst not that any one
should look upon thy wife with an evil design to corrupt her; do not
thou, therefore, look upon thy neighbour’s wife with a wicked intention.
Thou wouldst not that thy garment should be taken away; do not thou,
therefore, take away another’s. Thou wouldst not be beaten, reproached,
affronted; do not thou, therefore, serve any other in the like manner.  

#### <span id="ix.ii.i-p14.2"></span>That We Ought Not to Return Injuries, Nor Revenge Ourselves on Him that Does Us Wrong.

<span id="ix.ii.i-p15"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.ii.i-p15.1"></span>II</span>. But if any one curse thee, do thou
bless him. For it is written in the book of Numbers: “He that blesseth
thee is blessed, and he that curseth thee is cursed.” <span
id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md) In the same manner it is written in
the Gospel: “Bless them that curse you.” <span
id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549.md) Being injured, do not avenge
yourselves, but bear it with patience; for the Scripture speaks thus:
“Say not thou, I will avenge myself on my enemy for what injuries he has
offered me; but acquiesce under them, that the Lord may right thee, and
bring vengeance upon him who injures thee.” <span
id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550.md) For so says He again in the Gospel:
“Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them
which despitefully use you and persecute you; and ye shall be the
children of your Father which is in heaven: for He maketh His sun to
shine on the evil and on the good, and raineth on the just and
unjust.” <span id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551.md) Let us therefore,
beloved, attend to these commandments, that we may be found to be the
children of light by doing them. Bear, therefore, with one another, ye
servants and sons of God.
