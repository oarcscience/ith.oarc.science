#### <span id="iii.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chap. II.—Of the Truth and Its Steps, and of God.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p1"></span>For since there are many steps by which
the ascent is made to the abode of truth, it is not easy for any one to
reach the summit. For when the eyes are darkened by the brightness of
the truth, they who are unable to maintain a firm step fall back to the
level ground. <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) Now the first
step is to understand false religions, and to throw aside the impious
worship of gods which are made by the hand of man. But the second step
is to perceive with the mind that there is but one Supreme God, whose
power and providence made the world from the beginning, and afterwards
continues to govern it. The third step is to know His Servant and
Messenger, <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) <span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span id="iii.iii.ii-Page_260"></span>whom
He sent as His ambassador to the earth, by whose teaching being freed
from the error in which we were held entangled, and formed to the
worship of the true God, we might learn righteousness. From all of these
steps, as I have said, there is a rapid and easy gliding to a
downfall, <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) unless the feet are
firmly planted with unshaken stedfastness.  

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p5"></span>We see those shaken off from the first
step, who, though they understand things which are false, do not,
however, discover that which is true; and though they despised earthly
and frail images, do not betake themselves to the worship of God, of
whom they are ignorant. But viewing with admiration the elements of the
universe, they worship the heaven, the earth, the sea, the sun, the
moon, and the other heavenly bodies.  

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p6"></span>But we have already reproved their
ignorance in the second book of the <span
id="iii.iii.ii-p6.1"></span>Divine Institutes. <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) But we say that those fall from the
second step, who, though they understand that there is but one Supreme
God, nevertheless, ensnared by the philosophers, and captivated by false
arguments, entertain opinions concerning that excellent majesty far
removed from the truth; who either deny that God has any figure, or
think that He is moved by no affection, because every affection is a
sign of weakness, which has no existence in God. But they are
precipitated from the third step, who, though they know the Ambassador
of God, who is also the Builder of the divine and immortal temple, <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) either do not receive Him, or
receive Him otherwise than faith demands; whom we have partly refuted in
the fourth book of the above-named work. <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) And we will hereafter refute more
carefully, when we shall begin to reply to all the sects, which, while
they dispute, <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) have destroyed
the truth.  

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p11"></span>But now we will argue against those
who, falling from the second step, entertain wrong sentiments respecting
the Supreme God. For some say that He neither does a kindness to any
one, nor becomes angry, but in security and quietness enjoys the
advantages of His own immortality. Others, indeed, take away anger, but
leave to God kindness; for they think that a nature excelling in the
greatest virtue, while it ought not to be malevolent, ought also to be
benevolent. Thus all the philosophers are agreed on the subject of
anger, but are at variance respecting kindness. But, that my speech may
descend in order to the proposed subject, a division of this kind must
be made and followed by me, since anger and kindness are different, and
opposed to one another. Either anger must be attributed to God, and
kindness taken from Him; or both alike must be taken from Him; or anger
must be taken away, and kindness attributed to Him; or neither must be
taken away. The nature of the case admits of nothing else besides these;
so that the truth, which is sought for, must necessarily be found in
some one of these. Let us consider them separately, that reason and
arrangement may conduct us to the hiding-place of truth.
