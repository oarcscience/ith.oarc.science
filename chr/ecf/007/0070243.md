#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.li-p0.1"></span>Chap. LV.—The Heathens Charge Justice with Impiety in Following God.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.li-p1"></span>But they say that those are rightly
and deservedly punished, who dislike the public rites of religion handed
down to them by their ancestors. What if those ancestors were foolish in
undertaking vain religious rites, as we have shown before, <span
id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.li-Page_245"></span>shall we be prohibited from
following true and better things? Why do we deprive ourselves of
liberty, and become enslaved to the errors of others, as though
bound <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569) to them? Let it be
permitted us to be wise, let it be permitted us to inquire into the
truth. But, however, if it pleases them to defend <span
id="iii.ii.viii.li-p2.2"></span>the folly <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570) of their ancestors, why are the
Egyptians suffered to escape, who worship cattle and beasts of every
kind as deities? Why are the gods themselves made the subjects of
comic <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571) representations? and
why is he honoured who derides them most wittily? Why are philosophers
attended to, who either say that there are no gods, or that, if there
are any, they take no interest in, and do not regard the affairs of men,
or argue that there is no providence at all, which rules the world?  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.li-p5"></span>But they alone of all are judged
impious who follow God and the truth. And since this is at once justice,
and wisdom, they lay to its charge either impiety or folly, and do not
perceive what it is which deceives them, when they call evil good, and
good evil. Many indeed of the philosophers, and especially <span
id="iii.ii.viii.li-p5.1"></span>Plato and <span
id="iii.ii.viii.li-p5.2"></span>Aristotle, spoke many things about
justice, asserting and extolling that virtue with the greatest praise,
because it gives to each its due, because it maintains equity in all
things; and whereas the other virtues are as it were silent, and shut up
within, that it is justice alone which is neither concerned <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572) for itself only, nor hidden, but
altogether shows itself <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573)
abroad, and is ready for conferring a benefit, so as to assist as many
as possible: as though in truth justice ought to be in judges only, and
those placed in any post of authority, and not in all men.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.li-p8"></span>And yet there is no one of men, not
even of the lowest and of beggars, who is not capable of justice. But
because they did not know what it was, from what source it proceeded,
and what was its mode of operation, they assigned to a few only that
highest virtue, that is, the common good of all, and said that it aimed
at <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574) no advantages peculiar to
itself, but only the interests of others. And not without reason was
<span id="iii.ii.viii.li-p9.2"></span>Carneades raised up, a man of the
greatest talent and penetration, to refute their speech, and overthrow
the justice, which had no firm foundation; not because he thought that
justice was to be blamed, but that he might show that its defenders
brought forward no firm or certain argument respecting justice.
