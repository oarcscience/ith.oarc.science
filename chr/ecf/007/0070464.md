<span id="ix.viii.v"></span>

#### <span id="ix.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Sec. V.—Daily Prayers.

##### <span id="ix.viii.v-p0.2"></span>A Morning Prayer.

<span id="ix.viii.v-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.v-p1.1"></span>XLVII</span>. “Glory be to God in the
highest, and upon earth peace, good-will among men.” <span
id="fr_3543"></span>[3544](#fn_3543.md) We praise Thee, we sing hymns to
Thee, we bless Thee; we glorify Thee, we worship Thee by Thy great High
Priest; Thee who art the true God, who art the One Unbegotten, the only
inaccessible Being. For Thy great glory, O Lord and heavenly King, O God
the Father Almighty, O Lord God, <span
id="fr_3544"></span>[3545](#fn_3544.md) the Father of Christ the immaculate
Lamb, who taketh away the sin of the world, receive our prayer, Thou
that sittest upon the cherubim. For Thou only art holy, Thou only art
the Lord <span id="ix.viii.v-p3.3"></span>Jesus, the Christ of the God
of all created nature, and our King, by whom glory, honour, and worship
be to Thee.  

##### <span id="ix.viii.v-p3.4"></span>An Evening Prayer.

<span id="ix.viii.v-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.v-p4.1"></span>XLVIII</span>. “Ye children, praise the Lord:
praise the name of the Lord.” <span id="fr_3545"></span>[3546](#fn_3545.md)
We praise Thee, we sing hymns to Thee, we bless Thee for Thy great
glory, O Lord our King, the Father of Christ the immaculate Lamb, who
taketh away the sin of the world. Praise becomes Thee, hymns become
Thee, glory becomes Thee, the God and Father, <span
id="fr_3546"></span>[3547](#fn_3546.md) through the Son, in the most holy
Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen. “Now, O Lord, lettest Thou Thy servant
depart in peace, according to Thy word; for mine eyes have seen Thy
salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people, a
light for the revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people
Israel.” <span id="fr_3547"></span>[3548](#fn_3547.md)  

##### <span id="ix.viii.v-p7.2"></span>A Prayer at Dinner.

<span id="ix.viii.v-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.v-p8.1"></span>XLIX</span>. Thou art blessed, O Lord, who
nourishest me from my youth, who givest food to all flesh. Fill our
hearts with joy and gladness, that having always what is sufficient for
us, we may abound to every good work, in Christ <span
id="ix.viii.v-p8.2"></span>Jesus our Lord, through whom <span
id="fr_3548"></span>[3549](#fn_3548.md) glory, honour, and power be to Thee
for ever. Amen.  

#### <span id="ix.viii.v-p9.2"></span>General notice

<span id="ix.viii.v-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.v-p10.1"></span>Comparing</span> the <span
id="ix.viii.v-p10.2"></span>Teaching with chapters xxv. and xxvi. of
these <span id="ix.viii.v-p10.3"></span>Constitutions, it seems to me
that the nature of the eucharistic (thanksgiving) prayers becomes
apparent. They presuppose the formulas to be found in the eighth book of
the <span id="ix.viii.v-p10.4"></span>Constitutions, <span
id="fr_3549"></span>[3550](#fn_3549.md) and are such instructions as were
imparted only to <span id="ix.viii.v-p11.3"></span>catechumens; the part
peculiar to presbyters being withheld, of course, as <span
id="ix.viii.v-p11.4"></span>esoteric mysteries, until further knowledge
was canonically appropriate. See Elucidation IV. vol. vi. p. 236; and in
this volume, Elucidation I. p. 382. The Bryennios <span
id="ix.viii.v-p11.7"></span>ms. is cleared from nearly all difficulties
by Dr. <span id="ix.viii.v-p11.8"></span>Riddle’s lucid notes, when
compared with corresponding passages in the <span
id="ix.viii.v-p11.9"></span>Constitutions, or illustrated by such as are
supplementary.

prayer: “O Lord, only begotten Son, and Holy Spirit, Lord God, the Lamb
of God, the Son of the Father, who takest away the sins of the world,
receive our prayer. Thou who sittest at the right hand of the Father,
have mercy upon us, for Thou only art holy; Thou only art Christ, <span
id="ix.viii.v-p3.2"></span>Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father.
Amen.”
