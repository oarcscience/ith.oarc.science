#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.lix-p0.1"></span>Chap. LXIII.—That Shows are Most Powerful to Corrupt the Minds.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.lix-p1"></span>It remains to speak of public
shows, which, since they have a more powerful influence on the
corruption of the mind, ought to be avoided by the wise, and to be
altogether guarded against, <span id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lix-Page_249"></span>because it is said that they were
instituted in celebration of the honours of the gods. For the
exhibitions of shows are festivals of <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lix-p1.1"></span>Saturnus. The stage belongs to Father
<span id="iii.ii.viii.lix-p1.2"></span>Liber; but the Circensian games
are supposed to be dedicated to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.lix-p1.3"></span>Neptunus: so that now he who takes part
in these shows appears to have left the worship of God, and to have
passed over to profane rites. But I prefer to speak of the matter itself
rather than of its origin. What is so dreadful, what so foul, as the
slaughter of man? Therefore our life is protected by the most severe
laws; therefore wars are detestable. Yet custom finds how a man may
commit homicide without war, and without laws; and this is a pleasure to
him, that he has avenged guilt. But if to be present at homicide implies
a consciousness of guilt, and the spectator is involved in the same
guilt as the perpetrator, then in these slaughters of gladiators, he who
is a spectator is no less sprinkled with blood than he who sheds it; nor
can he be free from the guilt of bloodshed who wished it to be poured
out, or appear not to have slain, who both favoured the slayer and asked
a reward for him. What of the stage? Is it more holy,—on which comedy
converses on the subject of debaucheries and amours, tragedy of incest
and parricide? The immodest gestures also of players, with which they
imitate disreputable women, teach the lusts, which they express by
dancing. For the pantomime is a school of corruption, <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584.md) in which things which are shameful
are acted by a figurative representation, <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) that the things which are true may
be done without shame. These spectacles are viewed by youths, whose
dangerous age, which ought to be curbed and governed, is trained by
these representations to vices and sins. The circus, in truth, is
considered more innocent, but there is greater madness in this, since
the minds of the spectators are transported with such great madness,
that they not only break out into revilings, but often rise to strifes,
and battles, and contentions. Therefore all shows are to be avoided,
that we may be able to maintain a tranquil state of mind. We must
renounce hurtful pleasures, lest, charmed by pestilential sweetness, we
fall into the snares of death.
