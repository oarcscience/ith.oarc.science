<span id="iii.ii.iv.xi"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XI.—Of the Cause of the Incarnation of Christ.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p1"></span>When the Jews often resisted wholesome
precepts, and departed from the divine law, going astray to the impious
worship of false gods, then God filled just and chosen men with the Holy
Spirit, appointing them as prophets in the midst of the people, by whom
He might rebuke with threatening words the sins of the ungrateful
people, and nevertheless exhort them to repent of their wickedness; for
unless they did this, and, laying aside their vanities, return to their
God, it would come to pass that He would change His covenant, <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) that is, bestow <span
id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) the inheritance of eternal life upon
foreign nations, and collect to Himself a more faithful people out of
those who were aliens <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) by birth.
But they, when rebuked by the prophets, not only rejected their words;
but being offended because they were upbraided for their sins, they slew
the prophets themselves with studied <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md) tortures: all which things are sealed
up and preserved in the sacred writings. For the prophet <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p5.2"></span>Jeremiah says: <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) “I sent to you my servants the
prophets; I sent them before the morning light; but ye did not hearken,
nor incline your ears to hear, when I spake unto you: let every one of
you turn from his evil way, and from your most corrupt affections; and
ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and to your fathers for
ever. <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) Walk ye not after strange
gods, to serve them; and provoke me not to anger with the works of your
hands, that I should destroy you.” The prophet <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p7.1"></span>Ezra <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) also, who was in the times of the same
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p8.2"></span>Cyrus by whom the Jews were
restored, thus speaks: “They rebelled against Thee, and cast Thy law
behind their backs, and slew Thy prophets which testified against them,
that they might turn unto Thee.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p9"></span>The prophet <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p9.1"></span>Elias also, in the third book of
Kings: <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md) “I have been very
jealous <span id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581.md) for the Lord God of
hosts, because the children of Israel have forsaken Thee, thrown down
Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I only am left,
and they seek my life to take it away.” On account of these impieties of
theirs He cast them off for ever; <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md) and so He ceased to send to them
prophets. But He commanded His own Son, the first-begotten, <span
id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) the maker of all things, His own
counsellor, to descend from heaven, that He might transfer the sacred
religion of God to the Gentiles, <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md)
that is, to those who were ignorant of God, and might teach them
righteousness, which the perfidious people had cast aside. And He had
long before threatened that He would do this, as the prophet <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p14.1"></span>Malachi <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) shows, saying: “I have no pleasure in
you, saith the Lord, and I will not accept an offering from your hands;
for from the rising of the sun even unto its setting, my name shall be
great <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md) among the Gentiles.” <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p16.2"></span>David also in the seventeenth Psalm <span
id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) says: “Thou wilt make me the head of
the heathen; a people whom I have not known shall serve me.” <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p17.5"></span>Isaiah <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588.md) also thus speaks: “I come to gather
all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory; and I
will send among them a sign, and I will send those that escape of them
unto the nations which are afar off, which have not heard my fame; and
they shall declare my glory among <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xi-Page_110"></span>the Gentiles.” Therefore, when
God wished to send to the earth one who should measure <span
id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) His temple, He was unwilling to send
him with heavenly power and glory, that the people who had been
ungrateful towards God might be led into the greatest error, and suffer
punishment for their crimes, since they had not received their Lord and
God, as the prophets had before foretold that it would thus happen. For
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p19.3"></span>Isaiah whom the Jews most cruelly
slew, cutting him asunder with a saw, <span
id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) thus speaks: <span
id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md) “Hear, O heaven; and give ear, O
earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have begotten sons, and lifted <span
id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) them up on high, and they have
rejected me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s stall;
but Israel hath not known, my people has not understood.” <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p22.2"></span>Jeremiah also says, in like manner: <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) “The turtle and the swallow hath known
her time, and the sparrows of the field have observed <span
id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md) the times of their coming: but my
people have not known the judgment of the Lord. How do you say, We are
wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? The meting out <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) is in vain; the scribes are deceived
and confounded: the wise men are dismayed and taken, for they have
rejected the word of the Lord.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xi-p26"></span>Therefore (as I had begun to say),
when God had determined to send to men a teacher of righteousness, He
commanded Him to be born again a second time in the flesh, and to be
made in the likeness of man himself, to whom he was about to be a guide,
and companion, and teacher. But since God is kind and merciful <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md) to His people, He sent Him to those
very persons whom He hated, <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) that
He might not close the way of salvation against them for ever, but might
give them a free opportunity of following God, that they might both gain
the reward of life if they should follow Him (which many of them do, and
have done), and that they might incur the penalty of death by their
fault if they should reject their King. He ordered Him therefore to be
born again among them, and of their seed, lest, if He should be born of
another nation, they might be able to allege a just excuse from the law
for their rejection of Him; and at the same time, that there might be no
nation at all under heaven to which the hope of immortality should be
denied.
