#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIII.—Of the Resurrection of the Soul, and the Proofs of This Fact.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1"></span>Therefore they will not be born
again, which is impossible, but they will rise again, and be clothed by
God with bodies, and will remember their former life, and all its
actions; and being placed in the possession of heavenly goods, and
enjoying the pleasure of innumerable resources, they will give thanks to
God in His immediate presence, because He has destroyed all evil, and
because He has raised them to His kingdom and to perpetual life.
Respecting which resurrection the philosophers also attempted to speak
as corruptly as the poets. For <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Pythagoras asserted that souls passed
into new bodies; but foolishly, that they passed from men into cattle,
and from cattle into men; and that he himself was restored from <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.2"></span>Euphorbus. <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.3"></span>Chrysippus says better, whom <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.4"></span>Cicero speaks of as supporting the
portico of the Stoics, who, in the books which he wrote concerning
providence, when he was speaking of the renewing of the world,
introduced these words: “But since this is so, it is evident that
nothing is impossible, and that we, after our death, when certain
periods of time have again come round, are restored to this state in
which we now are.” But let us return from human to divine things. The
<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.5"></span>Sibyl thus speaks:—<span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-Page_215"></span>
 

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p1.6"></span> “For the whole race of
> mortals is hard to be believed; but when the judgment of the world and
> of mortals shall now come, which God Himself shall institute, judging
> the impious and the holy at the same time, then at length He shall
> send the wicked to darkness in fire. But as many as are holy shall
> live again on the earth, God giving them at the same time a spirit,
> and honour, and life.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiii-p2"></span>But if not only prophets, but even
bards, and poets, and philosophers, agree that there will be a
resurrection of the dead, let no one ask of us how this is possible: for
no reason can be assigned for divine works; but if from the beginning
God formed man in some unspeakable manner, we may believe that the old
man can be restored by Him who made the new man.
