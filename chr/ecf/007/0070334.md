#### <span id="iii.v.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXV.

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p1"></span>Some few days after, the portrait of
<span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>Constantine, adorned with laurels, was
brought to the pernicious wild beast, that, by receiving that symbol, he
might acknowledge <span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.2"></span>Constantine in the
quality of <span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.3"></span>emperor. He hesitated long
whether to receive it or not, and he was about to commit both the
portrait and its bearer to the flames, but his confidants dissuaded him
from a resolution so frantic. They admonished him of the danger, and
they represented that, if <span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.4"></span>Constantine
came with an armed force, all the soldiers, against whose inclination
obscure or unknown <span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.5"></span>Cæsars had been
created, would acknowledge him, and crowd eagerly to his standard. So
<span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.6"></span>Galerius, although with the utmost
unwillingness, accepted the portrait, and sent the imperial purple to
<span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.7"></span>Constantine, that he might seem of his
own accord to have received that prince into partnership of power with
him. And now his plans were deranged, and he could not, as he intended
formerly, admit <span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.8"></span>Licinius, without
exceeding the limited number of emperors. But <span
id="iii.v.xxv-p1.9"></span>this he devised, that <span
id="iii.v.xxv-p1.10"></span>Severus, who was more advanced in life,
should be named <span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.11"></span>emperor, and that
<span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.12"></span>Constantine, instead of the title of
<span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.13"></span>emperor, to which he had been named,
should receive that of <span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.14"></span>Cæsar in common
with <span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.15"></span>Maximin Daia, and so be degraded
from the second place to the fourth.
