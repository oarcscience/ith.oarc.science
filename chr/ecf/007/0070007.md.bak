<span id="iii.ii.i.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.i.ii-p0.1"></span>Chap. i.— of religion and wisdom.

<span id="iii.ii.i.ii-p1"></span>We undertake, therefore, to discuss
religion and divine things. For if some of the greatest orators,
veterans as it were of their profession, having completed the works of
their pleadings, at last gave themselves up to philosophy, and regarded
that as a most just rest from their labours, if they tortured their
minds in the investigation of those things which could not be found out,
so that they appear to have sought for themselves not so much leisure as
occupation, and that indeed with much greater trouble than in their
former pursuit; how much more justly shall I betake myself as to a most
safe harbour, to that pious, true, and divine wisdom, in which all
things are ready for utterance, pleasant to the hearing, easy to be
understood, honourable to be undertaken! And if some skilful men and
arbiters of justice composed and published Institutions of civil law, by
which they might lull the strifes and contentions of discordant
citizens, how much better and more rightly shall we follow up in writing
the divine Institutions, in which we shall not speak about
rain-droppings, or the turning of waters, or the preferring of claims,
but we shall speak of hope, of life, of salvation, of immortality, and
of God, that we may put an end to deadly superstitions and most
disgraceful errors.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.ii-p2"></span>And we now commence this work under the
auspices of your name, O mighty Emperor <span
id="iii.ii.i.ii-p2.1"></span>Constantine, who were the first of the
Roman princes to repudiate errors, and to acknowledge and honour the
majesty of the one and only true God. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) For when that most happy day had shone
upon the world, in which the Most High God raised you to the prosperous
height of power, you entered upon a dominion which was salutary and
desirable for all, with an excellent beginning, when, restoring justice
which had been overthrown and taken away, you expiated the most shameful
deed of others. In return for which action God will grant to you
happiness, virtue, and length of days, that even when old you may govern
the state with the same justice with which you began in youth, and may
hand down to your children the guardianship of the Roman name, as you
yourself received it from your father. For to the wicked, who still rage
against the righteous in other parts of the world, the Omnipotent will
also repay the reward of their wickedness with a severity proportioned
to its tardiness; for as He is a most indulgent Father towards the
godly, so is He a most upright Judge against the ungodly. And in my
desire to defend His religion and divine worship, to whom can I rather
appeal, whom can I address, but him by whom justice and wisdom have been
restored to the affairs of men?  

<span id="iii.ii.i.ii-p4"></span>Therefore, leaving the authors of this
earthly philosophy, who bring forward nothing certain, let us approach
the right path; for if I considered these to be sufficiently suitable
guides to a good life, I would both follow them myself, and exhort
others to follow them. But since they disagree among one another with
great contention, and are for the most part at variance with themselves,
it is evident that their path is by no means straightforward; since they
have severally marked out distinct ways for themselves according to
their own will, and have left great confusion to those who are seeking
for the truth. But since the truth is revealed from heaven to us who
have received the mystery of true religion, and since we follow God, the
teacher of wisdom and the guide to truth, we call together all, without
any distinction either of sex or of age, to heavenly pasture. For there
is no more pleasant food for the soul than the knowledge of truth, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) to the maintaining and explaining of
which we have destined seven books, although the subject is one of
almost boundless and immeasurable labour; so that if any one should wish
to dilate upon and follow up these things to their full extent, he would
have such an exuberant supply of subjects, that neither books would find
any limit, nor speech any end. But on this account we will put together
all things briefly, because those things which we are about to bring
forward are so plain and lucid, that it seems to be more wonderful that
the truth appears so obscure to men, and to those especially who are
commonly esteemed wise, or because men will only need to be trained by
us,—that is, to be recalled from the error in which they are entangled
to a better course of life.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.ii-p6"></span>And if, as I hope, we shall attain to
this, we will send them to the very fountain of learning, which is most
rich and abundant, by copious draughts of which they may appease the
thirst conceived within, and quench their ardour. And all things will be
easy, ready of accomplishment, and clear to them, if only they are not
annoyed at applying patience in reading or hearing to the perception of
the discipline of wisdom. <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) For many,
pertinaciously adhering to vain superstitions, harden themselves against
the manifest <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i.ii-Page_11"></span>truth, not so much deserving well of
their religions, which they wrongly maintain, as they deserve ill of
themselves; who, when they have a straight path, seek devious windings;
who leave the level ground that they may glide over a precipice; who
leave the light, that, blind and enfeebled, they may lie in darkness. We
must provide for these, that they may not fight against themselves, and
that they may be willing at length to be freed from inveterate errors.
And this they will assuredly do if they shall at any time see for what
purpose they were born; for this is the cause of their
perverseness,—namely, ignorance of themselves: and if any one, having
gained the knowledge of the truth, shall have shaken off this ignorance,
he will know to what object his life is to be directed, and how it is to
be spent. And I thus briefly define the sum of this knowledge, that
neither is any religion to be undertaken without wisdom, nor any wisdom
to be approved of without religion.
