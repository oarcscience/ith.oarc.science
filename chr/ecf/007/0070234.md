#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLVI.—It is Proved from the Prophets that the Passion and Death of Christ Had Been Foretold.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p1"></span>And the prophets had predicted
that all these things would thus come to pass. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Isaiah thus speaks: <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533) “I am not rebellious, nor do I
oppose: I gave my back to the scourge, and my cheeks to the hand: I
turned not away my face from the foulness of spitting.” The same prophet
says respecting His silence: <span id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534)
“I was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its
shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.” <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p3.2"></span>David also, in the xxxivth
Psalm: <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535) “The abjects were
gathered together against me, and they knew me not: they were scattered,
yet felt no remorse: they tempted me, and gnashed upon me with their
teeth.” The same also says respecting food and drink in the lxviiith
Psalm: <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536) “They gave me also
gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.” Also
<span id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-Page_241"></span>respecting the cross of
Christ: <span id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537) “And they pierced my
hands and my feet, they numbered all my bones: they themselves have
looked and stared upon me; they parted my garments among them, and cast
lots upon my vesture.” <span id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p6.2"></span>Moses
also says in Deuteronomy: <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538) “
And thy life shall hang in doubt before thine eyes, and thou shall fear
day and night, and shall have none assurance of thy life.” Also in
Numbers: <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539) “God is not in doubt
as a man, nor does He suffer threats as the son of man.” Also <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p8.2"></span>Zechariah says: <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540) “And they shall look on me whom
they pierced.” <span id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p9.2"></span>Amos <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541) thus speaks of the obscuring of the
sun: “In that day, saith the Lord, the sun shall go down at noon, and
the clear day shall be dark; and I will turn your feasts into mourning,
and your songs into lamentation.” <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p10.2"></span>Jeremiah <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542) also speaks of the city of
Jerusalem, in which He suffered: “Her sun is gone down while it was yet
day; she hath been confounded and reviled, and the residue of them will
I deliver to the sword.” Nor were these things spoken in vain. For after
a short time the Emperor <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p11.2"></span>Vespasian subdued the Jews, and laid
waste their lands with the sword and fire, besieged and reduced them by
famine, overthrew Jerusalem, led the captives in triumph, and prohibited
the others who were left from ever returning to their native land. And
these things were done by God on account of that crucifixion of Christ,
as He before declared this to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xlii-p11.3"></span>Solomon in their Scriptures,
saying, <span id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543) “And Israel shall be
for perdition and a reproach <span id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544)
to the people, and this house shall be desolate; and every one that
shall pass by shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath God done
these evils to this land, and to this house? And they shall say, Because
they forsook the Lord their God, and persecuted their King, who was
dearly beloved by God, and crucified Him with great degradation,
therefore hath God brought upon them these evils.” For what would they
not deserve who put to death their Lord, who had come for their
salvation?
