#### <span id="iii.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p1"></span>In the latter days of the Emperor <span
id="iii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Tiberius, in the consulship of <span
id="iii.v.ii-p1.2"></span>Ruberius Geminus and <span
id="iii.v.ii-p1.3"></span>Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the
kalends of April, <span id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md) as I find
it written, <span id="iii.v.ii-p2.1"></span>Jesus Christ was crucified
by the Jews. <span id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md) After He had
risen again on the third day, He gathered together His apostles, whom
fear, at the time of His being laid hold on, had put to flight; and
while He sojourned with them forty days, He opened their hearts,
interpreted to them the Scripture, which hitherto had been wrapped up in
obscurity, ordained and fitted them for the preaching of His word and
doctrine, and regulated all things concerning the institutions of the
New Testament; and this having been accomplished, a cloud and whirlwind
enveloped Him, and caught Him up from the sight of men unto heaven.  

<span id="iii.v.ii-p4"></span>His apostles were at that time eleven in
number, to whom were added <span id="iii.v.ii-p4.1"></span>Matthias, in
the room of the traitor <span id="iii.v.ii-p4.2"></span>Judas, and
afterwards <span id="iii.v.ii-p4.3"></span>Paul. Then were they
dispersed throughout all the earth to preach the Gospel, as the Lord
their Master had commanded them; and during twenty-five years, and until
the beginning of the reign of the Emperor <span
id="iii.v.ii-p4.4"></span>Nero, they occupied themselves in laying the
foundations of the Church in every province and city. And while <span
id="iii.v.ii-p4.5"></span>Nero reigned, the Apostle <span
id="iii.v.ii-p4.6"></span>Peter came to Rome, and, through the power of
God committed unto him, wrought certain miracles, and, by turning many
to the true religion, built up a faithful and stedfast temple <span
id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span id="iii.v.ii-Page_302"></span>unto the
Lord. When <span id="iii.v.ii-p4.7"></span>Nero heard of those things,
and observed that not only in Rome, but in every other place, a great
multitude revolted daily from the worship of idols, and, condemning
their old ways, went over to the new religion, he, an execrable and
pernicious tyrant, sprung forward to raze the heavenly temple and
destroy the true faith. He it was who first persecuted the servants of
God; he crucified <span id="iii.v.ii-p4.8"></span>Peter, and slew <span
id="iii.v.ii-p4.9"></span>Paul: <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md) nor did he escape with impunity;
for God looked on the affliction of His people; and therefore the
tyrant, bereaved of authority, and precipitated from the height of
empire, suddenly disappeared, and even the burial-place of that noxious
wild beast was nowhere to be seen. This has led some persons of
extravagant imagination to suppose that, having been conveyed to a
distant region, he is still reserved alive; and to him they apply the
Sibylline verses concerning  

> <span id="iii.v.ii-p5.5"></span> “The fugitive, who slew his own
> mother, being to come from the uttermost boundaries of the earth;”  

<span id="iii.v.ii-p6"></span>as if he who was the first should also be
the last persecutor, and thus prove the forerunner of Antichrist! But we
ought not to believe those who, affirming that the two prophets <span
id="iii.v.ii-p6.1"></span>Enoch and <span
id="iii.v.ii-p6.2"></span>Elias have been translated into some remote
place that they might attend our Lord when He shall come to
judgment, <span id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md) also fancy that
<span id="iii.v.ii-p7.3"></span>Nero is to appear hereafter as the
forerunner of the devil, when he shall come to lay waste the earth and
overthrow mankind.
