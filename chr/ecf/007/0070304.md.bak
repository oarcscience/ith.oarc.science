#### <span id="iii.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVII.—Of the Soul, and the Opinion of Philosophers Concerning It.

<span id="iii.iv.xvii-p1"></span>It remains to speak of the soul,
although its system and nature cannot be perceived. Nor, therefore, do
we fail to understand that the soul is immortal, since whatever is
vigorous and is in motion by itself at all times, and cannot be seen or
touched, must he eternal. But what the soul is, is not yet agreed upon
by philosophers, and perhaps will never be agreed upon. For some have
said that it is blood, others that it is fire, others wind, from which
it has received its name of <span class="Foreign"><span
id="iii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>anima</span>, or <span
class="Foreign"><span id="iii.iv.xvii-p1.2"></span>animus</span>,
because in Greek the wind is called <span class="Foreign"><span
id="iii.iv.xvii-p1.3"></span>anemos</span> <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921.md) and yet none of these appears to
have spoken anything. For if the soul appears to be extinguished when
the blood is poured forth through a wound, or is exhausted by the heat
of fevers, it does not therefore follow that the system of the soul is
to be placed in the material of the blood; as though a question should
arise as to the nature of the light which we make use of, and the answer
should be given that it is oil, for when that is consumed the light is
extinguished: since they are plainly different, but the one is the
nourishment of the other. Therefore the soul appears to be like light,
since it is not itself blood, but is nourished by the moisture of the
blood, as light is by oil.  

<span id="iii.iv.xvii-p3"></span>But they who have supposed it to be
fire made use of this argument, that when the soul is present the body
is warm, but on its departure the body grows cold. But fire is both
without perception and is seen, and burns when touched. But the soul is
both endowed with perception and cannot be seen, and does not burn. From
which it is evident that the soul is something like God. But they who
suppose that it is wind are deceived by this, because we appear to live
by drawing breath from the air. <span id="iii.iv.xvii-p3.1"></span>Varro
gives this definition: “The soul is air conceived in the mouth, warmed
in the lungs, heated in the heart, diffused into the body.” These things
are most plainly false. For I say that the nature of things of this kind
is not so obscure, that we do not even understand what cannot be true.
If any one should say to me that the heaven is of brass, or crystal, or,
as <span id="iii.iv.xvii-p3.2"></span>Empedocles says, that it is frozen
air, must I at once assent because I do not know of what material the
heaven is? For as I know not this, I know that. Therefore the soul is
not air conceived in the mouth, because the soul is produced much before
air can be conceived in the mouth. For it is not introduced into the
body after birth, as it appears to some philosophers, but immediately
after conception, when the divine necessity has formed the offspring in
the womb; for it so lives within the bowels of its mother, that it is
increased in growth, and delights to bound with repeated beatings. In
short, there must be a miscarriage if the living young within shall die.
The other parts of the definition have reference to this, that during
those nine months in which we were in the womb we appear to have been
dead. None, therefore, of these three opinions is true. We cannot,
however, say that they who held these sentiments were false to such an
extent that they said nothing at all; for we live at once by the blood,
and heat, and breath. But since the soul <span id="page_298">p.
298</span> <span id="iii.iv.xvii-Page_298"></span>exists in the body by
the union of all these, they did not express what it was in its own
proper sense; <span id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md) for as it
cannot be seen, so it cannot be expressed.
