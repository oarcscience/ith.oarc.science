#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLVII.—Of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Sending of the Apostles, and the Ascension of the Saviour into Heaven.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p1"></span>After these things they took His
body down from the cross, and buried it in a tomb. But on the third day,
before daybreak, there was an earthquake, and the stone with which they
had closed the sepulchre was removed, and He arose. But nothing was
found in the sepulchre except the clothes in which the body had been
wrapped. <span id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545) But that He would
rise again on the third day, the prophets had long ago foretold. <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p2.2"></span>David, in the xvth Psalm: <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546) “Thou wilt not leave my soul in
hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption.”
Likewise <span id="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p3.2"></span>Hosea: <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547) This my Son is wise, therefore He
shall not stay long in the anguish of His sons: and I will ransom Him
from the hand of the grave. Where is thy judgment, O death, where is thy
sting? “The same again says: <span id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548)
“After two days He will revive us on the third day.”  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p6"></span>Therefore, after His resurrection
He went into Galilee, and again assembled His disciples, who had fled
through fear; and having given them commands which He wished to be
observed, and having arranged for the preaching of the Gospel throughout
the whole world, He breathed into them the Holy Spirit, <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549) and gave them the power of working
miracles, that they might act for the welfare of men as well by deeds as
words; and then at length, on the fortieth day, He returned to His
Father, being carried up into a cloud. The prophet <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p7.1"></span>Daniel <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550) had long before shown this, saying,
“I saw in the night vision, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and they who
stood beside Him brought Him near before Him. And there was given Him a
kingdom, and glory, and dominion, and all people, tribes, and languages
shall serve Him; and His power is an everlasting one, which shall not
pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” Also
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xliii-p8.2"></span>David in the cixth Psalm: <span
id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551) “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit
Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”

the orthodoxy of our Christian philosopher as to the Third Person. He is
deficient, however, in practically enforcing the Spirit’s work and our
need of His grace. This may have been from a worthy motive, and
according to discipline.\]
