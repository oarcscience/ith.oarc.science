#### <span id="iii.v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIII.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p1"></span>Next day an edict was published,
depriving the Christians of all honours and dignities; <span
id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span
id="iii.v.xiii-Page_306"></span>ordaining also that, without any
distinction of rank or degree, they should be subjected to tortures, and
that every suit at law should be received against them; while, on the
other hand, they were debarred from being plaintiffs in questions of
wrong, adultery, or theft; and, finally, that they should neither be
capable of freedom, nor have right of suffrage. A certain person tore
down this edict, and cut it in pieces, improperly indeed, but with high
spirit, saying in scorn, “These are the triumphs of Goths and
Sarmatians.” Having been instantly seized and brought to judgment, he
was not only tortured, but burnt alive, in the forms of law; and having
displayed admirable patience under sufferings, he was consumed to ashes.
