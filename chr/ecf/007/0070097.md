#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XV.—Of the Life and Miracles of Jesus, and Testimonies Concerning Them.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p1"></span>Having spoken of the second nativity,
in which, He showed Himself in the flesh to men, let us come to those
wonderful works, on account of <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xv-Page_115"></span>which, though they were signs of
heavenly power, the Jews esteemed Him a magician. When He first began to
reach maturity <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) He was baptized
by the prophet <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p2.2"></span>John in the river
Jordan, that He might wash <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) away
in the spiritual laver not His own sins, for it is evident that He had
none, but those of the flesh, <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md)
which He bare; that as He saved the Jews by undergoing circumcision, so
He might save the Gentiles also by baptism—that is, by the pouring
forth <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) of the purifying dew. Then
a voice from heaven was heard: “Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten
Thee.” <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) Which voice is found to
have been foretold by <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p6.3"></span>David. And the
Spirit of God descended upon Him, formed after the appearance of a white
dove. <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) From that time He began to
perform the greatest miracles, not by magical tricks, which display
nothing true and substantial, but by heavenly strength and power, which
were foretold even long ago by the prophets who announced Him; which
works are so many, that a single book is not sufficient to comprise them
all. I will therefore enumerate them briefly and generally, without any
designation of persons and places, that I may be able to come to the
setting forth of His passion and cross, to which my discourse has long
been hastening. His powers were those which <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p7.4"></span>Apollo called wonderful: <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) that wherever He journeyed, by a
single word, and in a single moment, He healed the sick and infirm, and
those afflicted with every kind of disease: so that those who were
deprived of the use of all their limbs, having suddenly received power,
were strengthened, and themselves carried their couches, on which they
had a little time before been carried. But to the lame, and to those
afflicted with some defect <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) of
the feet, He not only gave the power of walking, but also of running.
Then, also, if any had their eyes blinded in the deepest darkness, He
restored them to their former sight. He also loosened the tongues of the
dumb, so that <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) they discoursed
and spake eloquently. He also opened the ears of the deaf, and caused
them to hear; <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) He cleansed the
polluted and the blemished. <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) And
He performed all these things not by His hands, or the application of
any remedy, <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) but by His word and
command, as also the <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p13.2"></span>Sibyl had
foretold: “Doing all things by His word, and healing every disease.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p14"></span>Nor, indeed, is it wonderful that He
did wonderful things by His word, since He Himself was the Word of God,
relying upon heavenly strength and power. Nor was it enough that He gave
strength to the feeble, soundness of body to the maimed, health to the
sick and languishing, unless He also raised the dead, as it were unbound
from sleep, and recalled them to life.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p15"></span>And the Jews, then, when they saw
these things, contended that they were done by demoniacal power,
although it was contained in their secret writings that all things
should thus come to pass as they did. They read indeed the words of
other prophets, and of Isaiah, <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md)
saying: “Be strong, ye hands that are relaxed; and ye weak knees, be
comforted. Ye who are of a fearful <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) heart, fear not, be not afraid: our
Lord shall execute judgment; He Himself shall come and save us. Then
shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall
hear: then shall the lame man leap as a deer, and the tongue of the dumb
speak plainly: <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) for in the
wilderness water hath broken forth, and a stream in the thirsty land.”
But the <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p18.2"></span>Sibyl also foretold the
same things in these verses:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p18.3"></span> “And there shall be a rising
> again of the dead; and the course of the lame shall be swift, and the
> deaf shall hear, and the blind shall see, the dumb shall speak.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p19"></span>On account of these powers and divine
works wrought by Him when a great multitude followed Him of the maimed,
or sick, or of those who desired to present their sick to be healed, He
went up into a desert mountain to pray there. And when He had tarried
there three days, and the people were suffering from hunger, He called
His disciples, and asked what quantity of food <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) they had with them. But they said that
they had five loaves and two fishes in a wallet. Then He commanded that
these should be brought forward, and that the multitude, distributed by
fifties, should recline <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p20.6"></span>on the
ground. When the disciples did this, He Himself broke the bread in
pieces, and divided the flesh of the fishes, and in His hands both of
them were increased. And when He had ordered the disciples to set them
before the people, five thousand men were satisfied, and moreover twelve
baskets <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) were filled from the
fragments which remained. What can be more wonderful, either in
narration or in action? <span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xv-Page_116"></span>But the <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p21.4"></span>Sibyl had before foretold that it would
take place, whose verses are related to this effect:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p21.5"></span> “With five loaves at the same
> time, and with two fishes,  
> He shall satisfy five thousand men in the wilderness;  
> And afterwards taking all the fragments that remain,  
> He shall fill twelve baskets to the hope of many.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p22"></span>I ask, therefore, what the art of
magic could have contrived in this case, the skill of which is of avail
for nothing else than for deceiving <span
id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) the eyes? He also, when He was about
to retire to a mountain, as He was wont, for the sake of prayer,
directed His disciples to take a small ship and go before Him. But they,
setting out when evening was now coming on, began to be distressed <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) through a contrary wind. And when they
were now in the midst of the sea, <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) then, setting His feet on the
sea, <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) He came up to them, walking
as though on the solid ground, <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md)
not as the poets fable <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p27.12"></span>Orion
walking on the sea, who, while a part of his body was sunk in the water,
 

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p27.13"></span> “With his shoulder rises above
> the waves.” <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p29"></span>And again, when He had gone to sleep
in the ship, and the wind had begun to rage, even to the extremity of
danger, being aroused from sleep, He immediately ordered the wind to be
silent; and the waves, which were borne with great violence, were still,
and immediately at His word there followed a calm.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p30"></span>But perhaps the sacred writings <span
id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) speak falsely, when they teach that
there was such power in Him, that by His command He compelled the winds
to obey, the seas to serve Him, diseases to depart, the dead to be
submissive. Why should I say that the Sibyls before taught the same
things in their verses? one of whom, already mentioned, thus speaks:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p31.4"></span> “He shall still the winds by His
> word, and calm the sea  
> As it rages, treading with feet of peace and in faith.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p32"></span>And again another, which says:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p32.1"></span> “He shall walk on the waves, He
> shall release men from disease.  
> He shall raise the dead, and drive away many pains;  
> And from the bread of one wallet there shall be a satisfying of
> men.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p33"></span>Some, refuted by these testimonies,
are accustomed to have recourse to the assertion that these poems were
not by the Sibyls, but made up and composed by our own writers. But he
will assuredly not think this who has read <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p33.1"></span>Cicero, <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) and <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p34.3"></span>Varro, and other ancient writers, who
make mention of the Erythræan and the other Sibyls, from whose books we
bring forward these examples; and these authors died before the birth of
Christ according to the flesh. But I do not doubt that these poems were
in former times regarded as ravings, since no one then understood them.
For they announced some marvellous wonders, of which neither the manner,
nor the time, nor the author was signified. Lastly, the <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p34.4"></span>Erythræan Sibyl says that it would come
to pass that she would be called mad and deceitful. But assuredly  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p34.5"></span> “They will say that the <span
> id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p34.7"></span>Sibyl  
> Is mad, and deceitful: but when all things shall come to pass,  
> Then ye will remember me; and no one will any longer  
> Say that I, the prophetess of the great God, am mad.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xv-p35"></span>Therefore they were <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) neglected for many ages; but they
received attention after the nativity and passion of Christ had revealed
secret things. Thus it was also with the utterances of the prophets,
which were read by the people of the Jews for fifteen hundred years and
more, but yet were not understood until after Christ had explained <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) them both by His word and by His
works. For the prophets spoke of Him; nor could the things which they
said have been in any way understood, unless they had been altogether
fulfilled.
