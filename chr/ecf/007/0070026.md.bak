<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chap. xx.—of the gods peculiar to the Romans, and their sacred rites.

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p1"></span>I now come to the superstitions
peculiar to the Romans, since I have spoken of those which are common.
The wolf, the nurse of <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p1.1"></span>Romulus, was
invested with divine honours. And I could endure this, if it had been
the animal itself whose figure she bears. <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p1.2"></span>Livy relates that there was an image of
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p1.3"></span>Larentina, and indeed not of her
body, but of her mind and character. For she was the wife of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p1.4"></span>Faustulus, and on account of her
prostitution she was called among the shepherds wolf, <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) that is, harlot, from which also the
brothel <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) derives its name. The
Romans doubtless followed the example of the Athenians in representing
her figure. For when a harlot, by name <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.1"></span>Leæna, had put to death a tyrant among
them, because it was unlawful for the image of a harlot to be placed in
the temple, they erected the effigy of the animal whose name she bore.
Therefore, as the Athenians erected a monument from the name, so did the
Romans from the profession<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.2"></span> of the
person thus honoured. A festival was also dedicated to her name, and the
Larentinalia were instituted. Nor is she the only harlot whom the Romans
worship, but also <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.3"></span>Faula, who was, as
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.4"></span>Verrius writes, the paramour of
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.5"></span>Hercules. Now how great must that
immortality be thought which is attained even by harlots! <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.6"></span>Flora, having obtained great wealth by
this practice, made the people her heir, and left a fixed sum of money,
from the annual proceeds of which her birthday might be celebrated by
public games, which they called Floralia. And because this appeared
disgraceful to the senate, in order that a kind of dignity might be
given to a shameful matter, they resolved that an argument should be
taken from the name itself. They pretended that she was the goddess who
presides over flowers, and that she must be appeased, that the crops,
together with the trees or vines, might produce a good and abundant
blossom. The poet followed up this idea in his <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.7"></span>Fasti, and related that there was a nymph,
by no means obscure, who was called <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.8"></span>Chloris, and that, on her marriage with
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.9"></span>Zephyrus, she received from her
husband as a wedding gift the control over all flowers. These things are
spoken with propriety, but to believe them is unbecoming and shameful.
And <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p3.10"></span>when the truth is in question,
ought disguises of this kind to deceive us? Those games, therefore, are
celebrated with all wantonness, as is suitable to the memory of a
harlot. For besides licentiousness of words, in which all lewdness is
poured forth, women are also stripped of their garments at the demand of
the people, and then perform the office of mimeplayers, and are detained
in the sight of the people with indecent gestures, even to the satiating
of unchaste eyes.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p4"></span><span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p4.1"></span>Tatius consecrated an image of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p4.2"></span>Cloacina, which had been found in the
great sewer; and because he did not know whose likeness it was, he gave
it a name from the place. <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p4.3"></span>Tullus
Hostilius fashioned and worshipped Fear and Pallor. What shall I say
respecting him, but that he was worthy of having his gods always at
hand, as men commonly wish? The conduct of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p4.4"></span>Marcus Marcellus concerning the
consecration of Honour and Valour differs from this in goodness of the
names, but agrees with it in reality. The senate <span id="page_33">p.
33</span> <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-Page_33"></span>acted with the same
vanity in placing Mind <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) among the
gods; for if they had possessed any intelligence, they would never have
undertaken sacred rites of this kind. <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p5.2"></span>Cicero says that Greece undertook a great
and bold design in consecrating the images of Cupids and Loves in the
gymnasia: it is plain that he flattered <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p5.3"></span>Atticus, and jested with his friend. For
that ought not to have been called a great design, or a design at all,
but the abandoned and deplorable wickedness of unchaste men, who exposed
their children, whom it was their duty to train to an honourable course,
to the lust of youth, and wished them to worship gods of profligacy, in
those places especially where their naked bodies were exposed to the
gaze of their corruptors, and at that age which, through its simplicity
and incautiousness, can be enticed and ensnared before it can be on its
guard. What wonder, if all kinds of profligacy flowed from this nation,
among whom vices themselves have the sanction of religion, and are so
far from being avoided, that they are even worshipped? And therefore, as
though he surpassed the Greeks in prudence, he subjoined to this
sentence as follows: “Vices ought not to be consecrated, but virtues.”
But if you admit this, O <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p5.4"></span>Marcus
Tullius, you do not see that it will come to pass that vices will break
in together with virtues, because evil things adhere to those which are
good, and have greater influence on the minds of men; and if you forbid
these to be consecrated, the same Greece will answer you that it
worships some gods that it may receive benefits, and others that it may
escape injuries.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p6"></span>For this is always the excuse of those
who regard their evils as gods, as the Romans esteem Blight and Fever.
If, therefore, vices are not to be consecrated, in which I agree with
you, neither indeed are virtues. For they have no intelligence or
perception of themselves; nor are they to be placed within walls or
shrines made of clay, but within the breast; and they are to be enclosed
within, lest they should be false if placed without man. Therefore I
laugh at that illustrious law of yours which you set forth in these
words: “But those things on account of which it is given to man to
ascend into heaven—<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p6.1"></span>I speak of mind,
virtue, piety, faith—let there be temples for their praises.” But these
things cannot be separated from man. For if they are to be honoured,
they must necessarily be in man himself. But if they are without man,
what need is there to honour those things which you do not possess? For
it is virtue, which is to be honoured, and not the image of virtue; and
it is to be honoured not by any sacrifice, or incense, or solemn prayer,
but only by the will and purpose. For what else is it to honour virtue,
but to comprehend it with the mind, and to hold it fast? And as soon as
any one begins to wish for this, he attains it. This is the only honour
of virtue; for no other religion and worship is to be held but that of
the one God. To what purport is it, then, O wisest man, to occupy with
superfluous buildings places which may turn out to the service of men?
To what purport is it to establish priests for the worship of vain and
senseless objects? To what purport to immolate victims? To what purport
to bestow such great expenditure on the forming or worshipping of
images? The human breast is a stronger and more uncorrupted temple: let
this rather be adorned, let this be filled with the true deities. For
they who thus worship the virtues—that is, who pursue the shadows and
images of virtues—cannot hold the very things which are true. Therefore
there is no virtue in any one when vices bear rule; there is no faith
when each individual carries off all things for himself; there is no
piety when avarice spares neither relatives nor parents, and passion
rushes to poison and the sword: no peace, no concord, when wars rage in
public, and in private enmities prevail even to bloodshed; no chastity
when unbridled lusts contaminate each sex, and the whole body in every
part. Nor, however, do they cease to worship those things which they
flee from and hate. For they worship with incense and the tips of their
fingers those things which they ought to have shrunk from with their
inmost feelings; and this error is altogether derived from their
ignorance of the principal and chief good.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p7"></span>When their city was occupied by the
Gauls, and the Romans, who were besieged in the Capitol, had made
military engines from the hair of the women, they dedicated a temple to
the Bald <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p7.1"></span>Venus. They do not
therefore understand how vain are their religions, even from this very
fact, that they jeer at them by these follies. They had perhaps learned
from the Lacedæmonians to invent for themselves gods from events. For
when they were besieging the Messenians, and they (the Messenians) had
gone out secretly, escaping the notice of the besiegers, and had
hastened to plunder Lacedæmon, they were routed and put to flight by the
Spartan women. But the Lacedæmonians, having learned the stratagem of
the enemy, followed. The women in arms went out to a distance to meet
them; and when they saw that their husbands were preparing themselves
for battle, supposing them to be Messenians, they laid bare their
persons. But the men, recognising their wives, and excited to passion by
the sight, rushed to promiscuous intercourse, for there was not time for
discrimination. In like manner, the youths who had on a <span
id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-Page_34"></span>former
occasion been sent by the same people, having intercourse with the
virgins, from whom the Partheniæ were born, in memory of this deed
erected a temple and statue to armed <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p7.2"></span>Venus. And although this originated in a
shameful cause, yet it seems better to have consecrated <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p7.3"></span>Venus as armed than bald. At the same time
an altar was erected also to <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p7.4"></span>Jupiter
Pistor (the baker), because he had admonished them in a dream to make
all the corn which they had into bread, and throw it into the camp of
the enemy; and when this was done, the siege was ended, since the Gauls
despaired of being able to reduce the Romans by want.  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8"></span>What a derision of religious rites is
this! I were a defender of these, what could I complain of so greatly as
that the name of gods had come into such contempt as to be mocked by the
most disgraceful names? Who would not laugh at the goddess <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.1"></span>Fornax, or rather that learned men should
be occupied with celebrating the <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.2"></span>Fornacalia? Who can refrain from laughter
on hearing of the goddess <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.3"></span>Muta? They
say that she is the goddess from whom the <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.4"></span>Lares were born, and they call her <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.5"></span>Lara, or <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.6"></span>Larunda. What advantage can she, who is
unable to speak, afford to a worshipper? <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.7"></span>Caca also is worshipped, who informed
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.8"></span>Hercules of the theft of his oxen,
having obtained immortality through the betrayal of her brother; and
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.9"></span>Cunina, who protects infants in the
cradle, and keeps off witchcraft; and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.10"></span>Stercutus, who first introduced the
method of manuring the land; and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.11"></span>Tutinus, before whom brides sit, as an
introduction to the marriage rites; and a thousand other fictions, so
that they who regarded these as objects of worship may be said to be
more foolish than the Egyptians, who worship certain monstrous and
ridiculous images. These however, have some delineation of form. What
shall I say of those who worship a rude and shapeless stone under the
name of <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.12"></span>Terminus? This is he whom
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.13"></span>Saturnus is said to have swallowed
in the place of <span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.14"></span>Jupiter; nor is the
honour paid to him undeservedly. For when <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.15"></span>Tarquinius wished to build the Capitol,
and there were the chapels of many gods on that spot, he consulted them
by augury whether they would give way to <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.16"></span>Jupiter; and when the rest gave way,
<span id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.17"></span>Terminus alone remained. From which
circumstance the poet speaks of the immoveable stone of the Capitol. Now
from this very fact how great is <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.18"></span>Jupiter found to be, to whom a stone did
not give way, with this confidence, perhaps, because it had rescued him
from the jaws of his father! Therefore, when the Capitol was built, an
aperture was left in the roof above <span
id="iii.ii.i.xxi-p8.19"></span>Terminus himself, that, since he had not
given way, he might enjoy the free heaven; but they did not themselves
enjoy this, who imagined that a stone enjoyed it. And therefore they
make public supplications to him, as to the god who is the guardian of
boundaries; and he is not only a stone, but sometimes also a stock. What
shall I say of those who worship such objects, unless—that they above
all others are stones and stocks?
