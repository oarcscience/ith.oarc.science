### <span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Against the Sabellians. <span id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md)

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span>1 <span class="sc"><span
id="vii.ii-p3.1"></span>Now</span> truly it would be just to dispute
against those who, by dividing and rending the monarchy, which is the
most august announcement of the Church of God, into, as it were, three
powers, and distinct substances (<span class="Foreign"><span
id="vii.ii-p3.2"></span>hypostases</span>), and three deities, destroy
it. <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) For I have heard that
some who preach and teach the word of God among you are teachers of this
opinion, who indeed diametrically, so to speak, are opposed to the
opinion of <span id="vii.ii-p4.3"></span>Sabellius. For he blasphemes in
saying that the Son Himself is the Father, and vice versa; but these in
a certain manner announce three gods, in that they divide the holy unity
into three different substances, absolutely separated from one another.
For it is essential that the Divine Word should be united to the God of
all, and that the Holy Spirit should abide and dwell in God; and thus
that the Divine Trinity should be reduced and gathered into one, as if
into a certain head—that is, into the omnipotent God of all. For the
doctrine of the foolish <span id="vii.ii-p4.4"></span>Marcion, which
cuts and divides the monarchy into three elements, is assuredly of the
devil, and is not of Christ’s true disciples, or of those to whom the
Saviour’s teaching is agreeable. For these indeed rightly know that the
Trinity is declared in the divine Scripture, but that the doctrine that
there are three gods is neither taught in the Old nor in the New
Testament.  

<span id="vii.ii-p5"></span>2 But neither are they less to be blamed who
think that the Son was a creation, and decided that the Lord was made
just as one of those things which really were made; whereas the divine
declarations testify that He was begotten, as is fitting and proper, but
not that He was created or made. It is therefore not a trifling, but a
very great impiety, to say that the Lord was in any wise made with
hands. For if the Son was made, there was a time when He was not; but He
always was, if, as He Himself declares, <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) He is undoubtedly in the Father.
And if Christ is the Word, the Wisdom, and the Power,—for the divine
writings tell us that Christ is these, as ye yourselves know,—assuredly
these are powers of God. Wherefore, if the Son was made, there was a
time when these were not in existence; <span
id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) and thus there was a time when God
was without these things, which is utterly absurd. But why should I
discourse at greater length to you about these matters, since ye are men
filled with the Spirit, and especially understanding what absurd results
follow from the opinion which asserts that the Son was made? The leaders
of this view seem to me to have given very little heed to these things,
and for that reason to have strayed absolutely, by explaining the
passage otherwise than as the divine and prophetic Scripture demands.
“The Lord created me the beginning of His ways.” <span
id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) For, as ye know, there is more than
one signification of the word “created;” and in this place “created” is
the same as “set over” the works made by Himself—made, I say, by the Son
Himself. But this “created” is not to be understood in the same manner
as “made.” For to make and to create are different from one another. “Is
not He Himself thy Father, that hath possessed thee and created
thee?” <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) says <span
id="vii.ii-p9.2"></span>Moses in the great song of Deuteronomy. And thus
might any one reasonably convict these men. Oh reckless and rash men!
was then “the first-born of every creature” <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) something made?—“He who was
begotten from the womb before the morning star?” <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) —He who in the person of Wisdom
says, “Before all the hills He begot me?” <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) Finally, any one may read in many
parts of the divine utterances that the Son is said to have been
begotten, but never that He was made. From which considerations, they
who dare to say that His divine and inexplicable generation was a
creation, are openly convicted of thinking that which is false
concerning the generation of the Lord.  

<span id="vii.ii-p13"></span>3 That admirable and divine unity,
therefore, <span id="page_366">p. 366</span> <span
id="vii.ii-Page_366"></span>must neither be separated into three
divinities, nor must the dignity and eminent greatness of the Lord be
diminished by <span id="vii.ii-p13.1"></span>having applied to it the
name of creation, but we must believe on God the Father Omnipotent, and
on Christ <span id="vii.ii-p13.2"></span>Jesus His Son, and on the Holy
Spirit. Moreover, that the Word is united to the God of all, because He
says, “I and the Father are one;” <span
id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md) and, “I am in the Father, and the
Father is in Me.” <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) Thus
doubtless will be maintained in its integrity <span
id="vii.ii-p15.2"></span>the doctrine of the divine Trinity, and the
sacred announcement of the monarchy.
