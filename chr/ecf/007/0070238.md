#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xlvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. L.—Why God Assumed a Mortal Body, and Suffered Death.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xlvi-p1"></span>It remains to answer those also,
who deem that it was unbecoming and unreasonable that God should be
clothed with a mortal body; that He should be in subjection to men; that
He should endure insults; that He should even suffer tortures and death.
I will speak my sentiments, and I will sum up, as I shall be able, an
immense subject in few words. He who teaches anything, ought, as I
think, himself to practice what he teaches, that he may compel men to
obey. For if he shall not practice them, he will detract from the faith
due to his precepts. Therefore there is need of examples, that the
precepts which are given may have firmness, and if any one shall prove
contumacious, and shall say that they cannot be carried out in practice,
the instructor may refute him by actual fact. <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562) Therefore a system of teaching
cannot be perfect, when it is delivered by words only; but it then
becomes perfect, when it is completed by deeds.  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xlvi-p3"></span>Since therefore Christ was sent to
men as a teacher of virtue, for the perfection of His teaching it was
plainly befitting that He should act as well as teach. But if He had not
assumed a human body, He would not have been able to practice what He
taught,—that is, not to be angry, not to desire riches, not to be
inflamed with lust, not to fear pain, to despise death. These things are
plainly virtues, but they cannot be done without flesh. Therefore He
assumed a body on this account, that, since He taught that the desires
of the flesh must be overcome, He might in person first practice it,
that no one might allege the frailty of the flesh as an excuse.
