<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVII.—Of the Superstitions of the Jews, and Their Hatred Against Jesus.

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p1"></span>But they alleged other causes for
their anger and envy, which they bore shut up <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) within in their hearts—namely, that He
destroyed the obligation <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) of the
law given by <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p3.2"></span>Moses; that is, that
He did not rest <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) on the Sabbath,
but laboured for the good <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) of
men; that He abolished circumcision; that He took away the necessity of
abstaining from the flesh of swine; <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) —in which things the mysteries of the
Jewish religion consist. On this account, therefore, the rest of the
people, who had not yet withdrawn <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) to Christ, were incited by the priests
to regard Him as impious, because He destroyed the obligation of the law
of God, though He did this not by His own judgment, but according to the
will of God, and after the predictions of the prophets. For Micah
announced that He would give a new law, in these terms: <span
id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) “The law shall go forth of Zion, and
the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many
people, and rebuke strong nations.” <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md) For the former law, which was given by
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p9.5"></span>Moses, was not given on Mount
Zion, but on Mount Horeb; <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) and
the <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p10.6"></span>Sibyl shows that it would
come to pass that this law would be destroyed by the Son of God:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p10.7"></span> “But when all these things
> which I told you shall be accomplished, then all the law is fulfilled
> with respect to Him.”  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p11"></span>But even <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p11.1"></span>Moses himself, by whom the law was
given which they so tenaciously maintain, though they have fallen away
from God, and have not acknowledged God, had foretold that it would come
to pass that a very great prophet would be sent by God, who should be
above the law, and be a bearer of the will of God to men. In Deuteronomy
he thus left it written: <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) “And
the Lord said unto me, I will raise them up a Prophet from among their
brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my word in His mouth, and He
shall speak unto them all that I shall command Him. And whosoever will
not hearken to those things which that Prophet shall speak in my name, I
will require <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) it of him.” The
Lord evidently announced by the law-giver himself that He was about to
send His own Son—that is, a law alive, and present <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) in person, and destroy that old law
given by a mortal, <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) that by Him
who was eternal He might ratify afresh a law which was eternal.  

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p16"></span>In like manner, <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p16.1"></span>Isaiah <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) thus prophesied concerning the
abolition of circumcision: “Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah who
dwell at Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among
thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord your God, and take away the
foreskins of your heart, lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn
that none can quench it.” Also <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p17.2"></span>Moses himself says: <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) “In the last days the Lord shall
circumcise thine heart to love the Lord thy God.” Also <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p18.2"></span>Jesus <span
id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) the son of Nun, his successor, said:
“And the Lord said unto <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p19.3"></span>Jesus,
Make thee knives of flint very sharp, and sit and circumcise the
children of Israel the second time.” He said that this second
circumcision would be not of the flesh, as the first was, which the Jews
practice even now, but of the heart and spirit, which was delivered by
Christ, who was the true <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p19.4"></span>Jesus.
For the prophet does not say, “And the Lord said unto me,” but “unto
<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p19.5"></span>Jesus,” that he might show that
God was not speaking of him, but of Christ, to whom God was then
speaking. For that <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p19.6"></span>Jesus
represented <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) Christ: for when he
was at first called Auses, <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md) <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p21.9"></span>Moses, foreseeing the future, ordered
that he should be called <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p21.10"></span>Jesus;
that since he had been chosen as the leader of the warfare <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-Page_119"></span>against Amalek, who was the enemy of
the children of Israel, he might both subdue the adversary by the
emblem <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) of the name, and lead the
people into the land of promise. And for this reason he was also
successor to <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p22.5"></span>Moses, to show that
the new law given by Christ <span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p22.6"></span>Jesus
was about to succeed to the old law which was given by <span
id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p22.7"></span>Moses. For that circumcision of the
flesh is plainly irrational; since, if God had so willed it, He might so
have formed man from the beginning, that he should be without a
foreskin. But it was a figure of this second circumcision, signifying
that the breast is to be laid bare; that is, that we ought to live with
an open and simple heart, since that part of the body which is
circumcised has a kind of resemblance to the heart, and is to be treated
with reverence. On this account God ordered that it should be laid bare,
that by this argument He might admonish us not to have our breast
hidden <span id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) in obscurity; that is,
not to veil any shameful deed within the secrets of conscience. This is
the circumcision of the heart of which the prophets speak, which God
transferred from the mortal flesh to the soul, which alone is about to
endure. For being desirous of promoting our life and salvation in
accordance with His own goodness, in that circumcision He hath set
before us repentance, that if we lay open our hearts,—that is if we
confess our sins and make satisfaction to God,—we shall obtain pardon,
which is denied to those who are obstinate and conceal their faults, by
Him who regards not the outward appearance, as man does, but the
innermost secrets of the heart. <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md)
 

<span id="iii.ii.iv.xvii-p25"></span>The forbidding of the flesh of
swine also has the same intention; for when God commanded them to
abstain from this, He willed that this should be especially understood,
that they should abstain from sins and impurities. For this animal is
filthy and unclean, <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) and never
looks up to heaven, <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) but
prostrates itself to the earth with its whole body and face: it is
always the slave of its appetite and food; nor during its life can it
afford any other service, as the other animals do, which either afford a
vehicle for riding, <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) or aid in
the cultivation of the fields, or draw waggons by their neck, or carry
burthens on their back, or furnish a covering with their skins, <span
id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md) or abound with a supply of milk, or
keep watch for guarding our houses. Therefore He forbade them to use the
flesh of the pig for food, that is, not to imitate the life of swine,
which are nourished only for death; lest, by devoting themselves to
their appetite and pleasures, they should be useless for working
righteousness, and should be visited with death. Also that they should
not immerse themselves in foul lusts, as the sow, which wallows in the
mire; <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) of that they do not serve
earthly images, and thus defile themselves with mud: for they do bedaub
themselves with mud who worship gods, that is, who worship mud and
earth. Thus all the precepts of the Jewish law have for their object the
setting forth of righteousness, since they are given in a
mysterious <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) manner, that under
the figure of carnal things those which are spiritual might be known.
