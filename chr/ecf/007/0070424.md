#### <span id="viii.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI. <span id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502) —Watchfulness; The Coming of the Lord.

<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p3"></span>1. Watch for your life’s sake. <span
id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503) Let not your lamps be quenched, nor
your loins unloosed; <span id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504) but be
ye ready, for ye know not the hour in which our Lord cometh. <span
id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505) 2. But often shall ye come
together, seeking the things which are befitting to your souls: for the
whole time of your faith will not profit you, <span
id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506) if ye be not made perfect in the
last time. 3. For in the last days <span
id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) false prophets and corrupters shall
be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, and love shall
be turned into hate; <span id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508) 4. for
when lawlessness increaseth, they shall hate and persecute and betray
one another, <span id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509) and then shall
appear the world-deceiver <span id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510) as
the Son of God, <span id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511) and shall do
signs and wonders, <span id="fr_2512"></span>[2513](#fn_2512) and the
earth shall be delivered into his hands, and he shall do iniquitous
things which have never yet come to pass since the beginning. 5. Then
shall the creation of men come into the fire of trial, <span
id="fr_2513"></span>[2514](#fn_2513) and many shall be made to stumble
and shall perish; but they that endure in their faith shall be
saved <span id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514) from under the curse
itself. <span id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515) 6. And then shall
appear the signs of the truth; <span
id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516) first, the sign of an
out-spreading <span id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517) in heaven; then
the sign of the sound of the trumpet; and the third, the resurrection of
the dead; 7. yet not of all, but as it is said: The Lord shall come and
all His saints with Him. <span id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518) 8.
Then shall the world see the Lord coming upon the clouds of
heaven. <span id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519)

<span id="fn_2502"></span>[382:2503](0070424.htm#fr_2502) <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p1.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p2"></span> The resemblance between this chapter
and <span id="viii.iii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, vii.
31, 32, is mainly in order of topics and in the identity of some phrases
and terms. Verses 3 and 4 (to the word “world-deceiver”) are reproduced
almost <span class="Foreign"><span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p2.2"></span>verbatim</span>. That the writer of the
<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p2.3"></span>Teaching used [Matt.
xxiv.](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#000)<span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p2.4"></span> is extremely probable, but the connection
of <span id="viii.iii.xvi-p2.5"></span>Apostolic Constitutions, with
this passage is evident. In <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p2.6"></span>Barnabas, iv., there are a few
corresponding phrases.  

<span id="fn_2503"></span>[382:2504](0070424.htm#fr_2503) <span

New Testament. The mistake has been in measuring God’s prophetic
chronology by our mathematical standard of years.

<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p16"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p16.1"></span>ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τοῦ καταθέματος</span>, “from
under the curse itself:” namely, that which has just been described.
<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p16.2"></span>Bryennios and others render “by the
curse Himself;” that is, Christ, whom they were tempted to revile. All
other interpretations either rest on textual emendations or are open to
grammatical objections. Of the two given above, that of <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p16.3"></span>Hall and <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p16.4"></span>Napier seems preferable.  

<span id="fn_2516"></span>[382:2517](0070424.htm#fr_2516) <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p16.5"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p17"></span> “Truth” might refer to Christ
Himself, but the personal advent is spoken of in verse 8; it is better,
then, to refer it to the truth respecting the <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p17.1"></span>parousia held by the early Christians.
For this belief they were mocked, and hence dwelt upon it and the
prophecies respecting it. The verse is probably based upon [Matt.
24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030),
[31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031)<span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p17.2"></span>; but some find here, as in verse 4, an
allusion to <span id="viii.iii.xvi-p17.3"></span>Paul’s eschatological
statements in the Epistles to the Thessalonians.  

<span id="fn_2517"></span>[382:2518](0070424.htm#fr_2517) <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p17.4"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p18"></span> Professor <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.1"></span>Hall now prefers to render <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.2"></span>ἐκπετάσεως</span>,
“outspreading,” instead of “unrolling,” as in his version originally.
<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.3"></span>Hitchcock and <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.4"></span>Brown, <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.5"></span>Schaff, and others, prefer “opening;”
that is, the apparent o pening in heaven through which the Lord will
descend. “Outspreading” is usually explained (so Professor <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.6"></span>Hall) as meaning the expanded sign of the
cross in the heavens, the patristic interpretation of [Matt. xxiv.
30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)<span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.7"></span>. <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.8"></span>Bryennios and <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.9"></span>Farrar refer it to the flying forth of
the saints to meet the Lord. There are other interpretations based on
textual emendations. As the word is very rare, it is difficult to
determine the exact sense. “Opening” seems lexically allowable and
otherwise free from objection.  

<span id="fn_2518"></span>[382:2519](0070424.htm#fr_2518) <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p18.10"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p19"></span> [Zech. xiv.
5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005)<span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p19.1"></span>. This citation is given substantially in
<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p19.2"></span>Apostolic Constitutions. As here
used, it seems to point to the first resurrection. Comp. [1 Thess. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017)<span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p19.3"></span>; [1 Cor. xv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023)<span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p19.4"></span>; [Rev. xx.
5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005)<span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p19.5"></span>. Probably it is based upon the Pauline
eschatology rather than upon that of the Apocalypse. At all events,
there is no allusion to the millennial statement of the latter. Since
there was in the early Church, in connection with the expectation of the
speedy coming of Christ, a marked tendency to Chiliasm, the silence
respecting the millennium may indicate that the writer was not
acquainted with the Apocalypse. This inference is allowable, however,
only on the assumption of the early date of the <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p19.6"></span>Teaching.  

<span id="fn_2519"></span>[382:2520](0070424.htm#fr_2519) <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p19.7"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.xvi-p20"></span> Comp. [Matt. xxiv.
30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030)<span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p20.1"></span>. The conclusion is abrupt, and in <span
id="viii.iii.xvi-p20.2"></span>Apostolic Constitutions the New-Testament
doctrine of future punishment and reward is added. The absence of all
reference to the destruction of Jerusalem would indicate that some time
had elapsed since that event. An interval of from thirty to sixty years
may well be claimed.
