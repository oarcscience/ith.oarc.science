“And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven
for about half an hour.”\] Whereby is signified the beginning of

being interrupted, he repeats it in order. For if the silence had
continued, here would be an end of his narrative.

“And I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven.”\] By the angel
flying through the midst of heaven is signified the Holy Spirit bearing
witness in two of the prophets that a great wrath of plagues was
imminent. If by any means, even in the last times, any one should be
willing to be converted, any one might even still be saved.
