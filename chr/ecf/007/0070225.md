#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXXVII.—Of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiii-p0.2"></span>Socrates and His Contradiction.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiii-p1"></span>After him <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Socrates held the first place in
philosophy, who was pronounced most wise even by the oracle, because he
confessed that he knew one thing only,—namely, that he knew nothing. And
on the authority of this oracle it was right that the natural
philosophers should restrain themselves, lest they should either inquire
into those things which they could not know, or should think that they
knew things which they did not know. Let us, however, see whether <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiii-p1.2"></span>Socrates was most wise, as the
Pythian god proclaimed. He often made use of this proverb, that that
which is above us has also no reference to us. He has now passed beyond
the limits of his opinion. For he who said that he knew one thing only,
found another thing to speak of, as though he knew it; but that in vain.
For God, who is plainly above us, is to be sought for; and religion is
to be undertaken, which alone separates us from the brutes, which indeed
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiii-p1.3"></span>Socrates not only rejected,
but even derided, in swearing by a goose and a dog, as if in truth he
could not have sworn by <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiii-p1.4"></span>Æsculapius, to whom he had vowed a
cock. Behold the sacrifice of a wise man! And because he was unable to
offer this in his own person, since he was at the point of death, he
entreated his friends to perform the vow after his death, lest forsooth
he should be detained as a debtor in the lower regions. He assuredly
both pronounced that he knew nothing, and made good his statement. <span

countrymen. See <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxiii-p2.2"></span>Tayler Lewis
