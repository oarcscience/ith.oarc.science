<span id="iii.ii.ii.viii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chap. viii.—of the use of reason in religion; and of dreams, auguries, oracles, and similar portents.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p1"></span>It is therefore right, especially in
a matter on which the whole plan of life turns, that every one should
place confidence in himself, and use his own judgment and individual
capacity for the investigation and weighing of the truth, rather than
through confidence in others to be deceived by their errors, as though
he himself were without understanding. God has given wisdom to all
alike, <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) that they might be able
both to investigate things which they have not heard, and to weigh
things which they have heard. Nor, because they preceded us in time, did
they also outstrip us in wisdom; for if this is given equally to all, we
cannot be anticipated <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) in it by
those who precede us. It is incapable of diminution, as the light and
brilliancy of the sun; because, as the sun is the light of the eyes, so
is wisdom the light of man’s heart. Wherefore, since wisdom—that is, the
inquiry after truth—is natural to all, they deprive themselves of
wisdom, who without any judgment approve of the discoveries of their
ancestors, and like sheep are led by others. But this escapes their
notice, that the name of ancestors being introduced, they think it
impossible that they themselves should have more knowledge because they
are called descendants, or that the others should be unwise because they
are called ancestors. <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) What,
therefore, prevents us from taking a precedent <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) from them, that as they handed down to
posterity their false inventions, so we who have discovered the truth
may hand down better things to our posterity? There remains therefore a
great subject of inquiry, the discussion of which does not come from
talent, but from knowledge: and this must be explained at greater
length, that nothing at all may be left in doubt. For perhaps some one
may have recourse to those things which are handed down by many and
undoubted authorities; that those very persons, whom we have shown to be
no gods, have often displayed their majesty both by prodigies, and
dreams, and auguries, and oracles. And, indeed, many wonderful things
may be enumerated, and especially this, that <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p5.1"></span>Accius Navius, a consummate augur, when
he was warning <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p5.2"></span>Tarquinius Priscus
to undertake the commencement of nothing new without the previous
sanction of auguries, <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) and the
king, detracting from <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) the credit
due to his art, told him to consult the birds, and then to announce to
him whether it was possible for that which he himself had conceived in
his mind to be accomplished, and <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p7.1"></span>Navius affirmed that it was possible;
then take this whetstone, he said, and divide it with a razor. But the
other without any hesitation took and cut it.  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p8"></span>In the next place is the fact of
<span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p8.1"></span>Castor and <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p8.2"></span>Pollux having been seen in the Latin war
at the lake of Juturna washing off the sweat of their horses, when their
temple which adjoins the fountain had been open of its own accord. In
the Macedonian war the same <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p8.3"></span>deities, mounted on white horses, are
said to have presented themselves to <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p8.4"></span>Publius Vatienus as he went to Rome at
night, announcing that King <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p8.5"></span>Perseus had been vanquished and taken
captive on that day, the truth of which was proved by letters received
from <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p8.6"></span>Paulus <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) a few days afterwards. That also is
wonderful, that the statue of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p9.2"></span>Fortune, in the form <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) of a woman, is reported to have spoken
more than once; also that the statue of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p10.1"></span>Juno Moneta, <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) when, on the capture of Veii, one of
the soldiers, being sent to remove it, sportively and in jest asked
whether she wished to remove to Rome, answered that she wished it. <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p11.2"></span>Claudia also is set forth as an example
of a miracle. For when, in accordance with the Sibylline books, the
Idæan mother was sent for, and the ship in which she was conveyed had
grounded on a shoal of the river Tiber, and could not be moved by any
force, they report that <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p11.3"></span>Claudia,
who had been always regarded as unchaste on account of her excess in
personal adornment, with bended knees entreated the goddess, if she
judged her to be chaste, to follow her girdle; and thus the ship, which
could not be moved by all the strong men, <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) was moved by a single woman. It is
equally wonderful, that during the prevalence of a pestilence, <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p12.1"></span>Æsculapius, being called from <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p12.2"></span>Epidaurus, is said to have released the
city of Rome from the long-continued plague. <span id="page_52">p.
52</span> <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-Page_52"></span>  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p13"></span>Sacrilegious persons can also be
mentioned, by the immediate punishment of whom the gods are believed to
have avenged the injury done to them. <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p13.1"></span>Appius Claudius the censor having,
against the advice of the oracle, transferred the sacred rites of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p13.2"></span>Hercules to the public slaves, <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) was deprived of his eyesight; and the
Potitian <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p14.2"></span>gens, which
abandoned <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) its privilege, within
the space of one year became extinct. Likewise the censor <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p15.1"></span>Fulvius, when he had taken away the
marble tiles from the temple of the Lacinian <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p16.1"></span>Juno, to cover the temple of the
equestrian <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p16.2"></span>Fortuna, which he had
built at Rome, was deprived of his senses, and having lost his two sons
who were serving in Illyricum, was consumed with the greatest grief of
mind. <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p16.3"></span>Turullius also, the
lieutenant of <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p16.4"></span>Mark Antony, when
he had cut down a grove of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p16.5"></span>Æsculapius in Cos, <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) and built a fleet, was afterwards
slain at the same place by the soldiers of Cæsar. To these examples is
added <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p17.2"></span>Pyrrhus, who, having taken
away money from the treasure of the Locrian <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p17.3"></span>Proserpine, was shipwrecked, and dashed
against the shores near to the temple of the goddess, so that nothing
was found uninjured except that money. <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p17.4"></span>Ceres of Miletus also gained for
herself great veneration among men. For when the city had been taken by
<span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p17.5"></span>Alexander, and the soldiers had
rushed in to plunder her temple, a flame of fire suddenly thrown upon
them blinded them all.  

<span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p18"></span>There are also found dreams which
seem to show the power of the gods. For it is said that <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p18.1"></span>Jupiter presented himself to <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p18.2"></span>Tiberius Atinius, a plebeian, in his
sleep, and enjoined him to announce to the consuls and senate, that in
the last Circensian <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) games a
public dancer had displeased him, because a certain <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p19.2"></span>Antonius Maximus had severely scourged
a slave under the <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p19.3"></span>furca <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) in the middle of the circus, and had
led him to punishment, and that on this account the games ought to be
repeated. And when he had neglected this command, he is said on the same
day to have lost his son, and to have been himself seized by a severe
disease; and that when he again perceived the same image asking whether
he had suffered sufficient punishment for the neglect of his command, he
was carried on a litter to the consuls; and having explained the whole
matter in the senate, he regained strength of body, and returned to his
house on foot. And that dream also was not less wonderful, to which it
is said that <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p20.1"></span>Augustus Cæsar owed
his preservation. For when in the civil war with <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p20.2"></span>Brutus he was afflicted with a severe
disease, and had determined to abstain from battle, the image of <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p20.3"></span>Minerva presented itself to his
physician <span id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p20.4"></span>Artorius, advising him
that Cæsar should not confine himself to the camp on account of his
bodily infirmity. He was therefore carried on a litter to the army, and
on the same day the camp was taken by <span
id="iii.ii.ii.viii-p20.5"></span>Brutus. Many other examples of a
similar nature may be brought forward; but I fear that, if I shall delay
too long in the setting forth of contrary subjects, I may either appear
to have forgotten my purpose, or may incur the charge of loquacity.
