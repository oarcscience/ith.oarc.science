<span id="ix.vii.v"></span>

#### <span id="ix.vii.v-p0.1"></span>Sec. V.—The Teaching of the Apostles in Opposition to Jewish and Gentile Superstitions, Especially in Regard to Marriage and Funerals.

##### <span id="ix.vii.v-p0.2"></span>That We Ought to Avoid the Heretics as the Corrupters of Souls.

<span id="ix.vii.v-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.v-p1.1"></span>XXVI</span>. Do you therefore, O bishops, and
ye of the laity, avoid all heretics who abuse the law and the prophets.
For they are enemies to God Almighty, and disobey Him, and do not
confess <span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="ix.vii.v-Page_462"></span>Christ to be the Son of God. For they also
deny His generation according to the flesh; they are ashamed of the
cross; they abuse His passion and His death; they know not His
resurrection; they take away His generation before all ages. Nay, some
of them are impious after another manner, imagining the Lord to be a
mere man, supposing Him to consist of a soul and body. But others of
them suppose that <span id="ix.vii.v-p1.2"></span>Jesus Himself is the
God over all, and glorify Him as His own Father, and suppose Him to be
both the Son and the Comforter; than which doctrines what can be more
detestable? Others, again, of them do refuse certain meats, and say that
marriage with the procreation of children is evil, and the contrivance
of the devil; and being ungodly themselves, they are not willing to rise
again from the dead on account of their wickedness. Wherefore also they
ridicule the resurrection, and say, We are holy people, unwilling to eat
and to drink; and they fancy that they shall rise again from the dead
demons without flesh, who shall be condemned for ever in eternal fire.
Fly therefore from them, lest ye perish with them in their impieties.  

##### <span id="ix.vii.v-p1.3"></span>Of Some Jewish and Gentile Observances.

<span id="ix.vii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.v-p2.1"></span>XXVII</span>. Now if any persons keep to the
Jewish customs and observances concerning the natural emission and
nocturnal pollutions, and the lawful conjugal acts, <span
id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312.md) let them tell us whether in those
hours or days, when they undergo any such thing, they observe not to
pray, or to touch a Bible, or to partake of the Eucharist? And if they
own it to be so, it is plain they are void of the Holy Spirit, which
always continues with the faithful. For concerning holy persons <span
id="ix.vii.v-p3.2"></span>Solomon says: “That every one may prepare
himself, that so when he sleeps it may keep him, and when he arises it
may talk with him.” <span id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313.md) For if
thou thinkest, O woman, when thou art seven days in thy separation, that
thou art void of the Holy Spirit, then if thou shouldest die suddenly
thou wilt depart void of the Spirit, and without assured hope in God; or
else thou must imagine that the Spirit always is inseparable from thee,
as not being in a place. But thou standest in need of prayer and the
Eucharist, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, as having been guilty of no
fault in this matter. For neither lawful mixture, nor child-bearing, nor
the menstrual purgation, nor nocturnal pollution, can defile the nature
of a man, or separate the Holy Spirit from him. Nothing but impiety and
unlawful practice can do that. For the Holy Spirit always abides with
those that are possessed of it, so long as they are worthy; and those
from whom it is departed, it leaves them desolate, and exposed to the
wicked spirit. Now every man is filled either with the holy or with the
unclean spirit; and it is not possible to avoid the one or the other,
unless they can receive opposite spirits. For the Comforter hates every
lie, and the devil hates all truth. But every one that is baptized
agreeably to the truth is separated from the diabolical spirit, and is
under the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit remains with him so long as
he is doing good, and fills him with wisdom and understanding, and
suffers not the wicked spirit to approach him, but watches over his
goings. Thou therefore, O woman, if, as thou sayest, in the days of thy
separation thou art void of the Holy Spirit, thou art then filled with
the unclean one; for by neglecting to pray and to read thou wilt invite
him to thee, though he were unwilling. For this spirit, of all others,
loves the ungrateful, the slothful, the careless, and the drowsy, since
he himself by ingratitude was distempered with evil mind, and was
thereby deprived by God his dignity; having rather chosen to be a devil
than an archangel. Wherefore, O woman, eschew such vain words, and be
ever mindful of God that created thee, and pray to Him. For He is thy
Lord, and the Lord of the universe; and meditate in His laws without
observing any such things, such as the natural purgation, lawful
mixture, child-birth, a miscarriage, or a blemish of the body; since
such observations are the vain inventions of foolish men, and such
inventions as have no sense in them. Neither the burial of a man, nor a
dead man’s bone, nor a sepulchre, nor any particular sort of food, nor
the nocturnal pollution, can defile the soul of man; but only impiety
towards God, and transgression, and injustice towards one’s neighbour; I
mean rapine, violence, or if there be anything contrary to His
righteousness, adultery or fornication. Wherefore, beloved, avoid and
eschew such observations, for they are heathenish. For we do not
abominate a dead man, as do they, seeing we hope that he will live
again. Nor do we hate lawful mixture; for it is their practice to act
impiously in such instances. For the conjunction of man and wife, if it
be with righteousness, is agreeable to the mind of God. “For He that
made them at the beginning made them male and female; and He blessed
them, and said, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.” <span
id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314.md) If, therefore, the difference of
sexes was made by the will of God for the generation of multitudes, then
must the conjunction of male and female be also acceptable to His mind.
 

##### <span id="ix.vii.v-p5.3"></span>Of the Love of Boys, Adultery, and Fornication.

<span id="ix.vii.v-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.v-p6.1"></span>XXVIII</span>. But we do not say so of that
mixture that is contrary to nature, or of any unlawful <span
id="page_463">p. 463</span> <span
id="ix.vii.v-Page_463"></span>practice; for such are enmity to God. For
the sin of Sodom is contrary to nature, as is also that with brute
beasts. But adultery and fornication are against the law; the one
whereof is impiety, the other injustice, and, in a word, no other than a
great sin. But neither sort of them is without its punishment in its own
proper nature. For the practisers of one sort attempt the dissolution of
the world, and endeavour to make the natural course of things to change
for one that is unnatural; but those of the second sort—the
adulterers—are unjust by corrupting others’ marriages, and dividing into
two what God hath made one, rendering the children suspected, and
exposing the true husband to the snares of others. And fornication is
the destruction of one’s own flesh, not being made use of for the
procreation of children, but entirely for the sake of pleasure, which is
a mark of incontinency, and not a sign of virtue. All these things are
forbidden by the laws; for thus say the oracles: “Thou shalt not lie
with mankind as with womankind.” <span
id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315.md) “For such a one is accursed, and ye
shall stone them with stones: they have wrought abomination.” <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316.md) “Every one that lieth with a beast,
slay ye him: he has wrought wickedness in his people.” <span
id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317.md) “And if any one defile a married
woman, slay ye them both: they have wrought wickedness; they are guilty;
let them die.” <span id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318.md) And
afterwards: “There shall not be a fornicator among the children of
Israel, and there shall not be an whore among the daughters of Israel.
Thou shalt not offer the hire of an harlot to the Lord thy God upon the
altar, nor the price of a dog.” <span
id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319.md) “For the vows arising from the hire
of an harlot are not clean.” <span id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320.md)
These things the laws have forbidden, but they have honoured marriage,
and have called it blessed, since God has blessed it who joined male and
female together. <span id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md) And wise
<span id="ix.vii.v-p13.2"></span>Solomon somewhere says: “A wife is
suited to her husband by the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md) And <span
id="ix.vii.v-p14.2"></span>David says: “Thy wife is like a flourishing
vine in the sides of thine house; thy children like olive-branches round
about thy table. Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323.md) Wherefore “marriage is
honourable” <span id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324.md) and comely, and
the begetting of children pure, for there is no evil in that which is
good. Therefore neither is the natural purgation abominable before God,
who has ordered it to happen to women within the space of thirty days
for their advantage and healthful state, who do less move about, and
keep usually at home in the house. Nay, moreover, even in the Gospel,
when the woman with the perpetual purgation of blood <span
id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) touched the saving border of the
Lord’s garment in hope of being healed, He was not angry at her, nor did
complain of her at all; but, on the contrary, He healed her, saying,
“Thy faith hath saved thee.” When the natural purgations do appear in
the wives, let not their husbands approach them, out of regard to the
children to be begotten; for the law has forbidden it, for it says:
“Thou shalt not come near thy wife when she is in her separation.” <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md) Nor, indeed, let them frequent
their wives’ company when they are with child. <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) For they do this not for the
begetting of children, but for the sake of pleasure. Now a lover of God
ought not to be a lover of pleasure.  

##### <span id="ix.vii.v-p19.4"></span>How Wives Ought to Be Subject to Their Own Husbands, and Husbands Ought to Love Their Own Wives.

<span id="ix.vii.v-p20"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.vii.v-p20.1"></span>XXXIX</span>. Ye wives, be subject to your
own husbands, and have them in esteem, and serve them with fear and
love, as holy <span id="ix.vii.v-p20.2"></span>Sarah honoured <span
id="ix.vii.v-p20.3"></span>Abraham. For she could not endure to call him
by his name, but called him lord, when she said, “My lord is old.” <span
id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) In like manner, ye husbands, love
your own wives as your own members, as partners in life, and
fellow-helpers for the procreation of children. For says He, “Rejoice
with the wife of thy youth. Let her conversation be to thee as a loving
hind, and a pleasant foal; let her alone guide thee, and be with thee at
all times: for if thou beest every way encompassed with her friendship,
thou wilt be happy in her society.” <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md) Love them therefore as your own
members, as your very bodies; for so it is written, “The Lord has
testified between thee and between the wife of thy youth; and she is thy
partner, and another has not made her: and she is the remains of thy
spirit;” and, “Take heed to your spirit, and do not forsake the wife of
thy youth.” <span id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md) An husband,
therefore, and a wife, when they company together in lawful marriage,
and rise from one another, may pray without any observations, and
without washing are clean. But whosoever corrupts and defiles another
man’s wife, or is defiled with an harlot, when he arises up from her,
though he should wash himself in the entire ocean and all the rivers,
cannot be clean.
