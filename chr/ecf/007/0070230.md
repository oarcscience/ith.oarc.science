#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLII.—Of Religious Wisdom: the Name of Christ Known to None, Except Himself and His Father.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p1"></span>I will now say what wise
religion, or religious wisdom, is. God, in the beginning, before He made
the world, from the fountain of His own eternity, and from the divine
and everlasting Spirit, <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511) begat
for Himself a Son incorruptible, faithful, corresponding to His Father’s
excellence and majesty. He is virtue, He is reason, He is the word of
God, He is wisdom. With this artificer, as <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p2.3"></span>Hermes says, and counsellor, as the
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p2.4"></span>Sibyl says, He contrived the
excellent and wondrous fabric of this world. In fine, of all the angels,
whom the same God formed from His own breath, <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512) He alone was admitted into a
participation of His supreme power, He alone was called God. For all
things were through Him, and nothing was without Him. In fine, <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p3.2"></span>Plato, not altogether as a
philosopher, but as a seer, spoke concerning the first and second God,
perhaps following <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p3.3"></span>Trismegistus in this, whose words I
have translated from the Greek, and subjoined: “The Lord and Maker of
all things, whom we have thought to be called God, created <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513) a second God, who is visible and
sensible. But by sensible I mean, not that He Himself receives
sensation, but that He causes sensation and sight. When, therefore, He
had made this, the first, and one, and only one, He appeared to Him most
excellent, and full of all good qualities.” The <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p4.2"></span>Sibyl also says that God the guide
of all was made by God, and another, that  

> <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p4.3"></span> “God the Son of God must
> be known,”  

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p5"></span>as those examples which I have
brought forward in my books declare. Him the prophets, filled with the
inspiration of the Divine Spirit, proclaimed; of whom especially <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p5.1"></span>Solomon in the book of Wisdom, and
also his father, the writer of divine hymns—both most renowned kings,
who preceded the times of the Trojan war by a hundred and eighty
years <span id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514) —testify that He was
born of God. His name is known to none, except to Himself and the
Father, as <span id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p6.3"></span>John teaches in
the Revelation. <span id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515) <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p7.2"></span>Hermes says that His name cannot be
uttered by mortal mouth. Yet by men He is called by two names—<span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-p7.3"></span>Jesus, which is Saviour, and
Christ, which is King. He is called Saviour on this account, because He
is the health and safety of all who believe in God through Him. He is
called Christ on this account, because He Himself will come from <span
id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xxxviii-Page_239"></span>heaven at the end of this
dispensation <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516) to judge the
world, and, having raised the dead, to establish for Himself an
everlasting kingdom.
