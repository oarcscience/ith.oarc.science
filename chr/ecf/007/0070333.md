#### <span id="iii.v.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIV.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1"></span>Already the judgment of God approached
him, and that season ensued in which his fortunes began to droop and to
waste away. While occupied in the manner that I have described above, he
did not set himself to subvert or expel <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Constantius, but waited for his death, not
imagining, however, that it was so nigh. <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.2"></span>Constantius, having become exceedingly ill,
wrote to <span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.3"></span>Galerius, and requested that
his son <span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.4"></span>Constantine might be sent to
see him. He had made a like request long before, but in vain; for <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.5"></span>Galerius meant nothing less than to grant
it. On the contrary, he laid repeated snares for the life of that young
man, because he durst not use open violence, lest he should stir up
civil wars against himself, and incur that which he most dreaded, the
hate <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-Page_311"></span>and resentment of the army. Under
pretence of manly exercise and recreation, he made him combat with wild
beasts: but this device was frustrated; for the power of God protected
<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.6"></span>Constantine, and in the very moment of
jeopardy rescued him from the hands of <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.7"></span>Galerius. At length, <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.8"></span>Galerius, when he could no longer avoid
complying with the request of <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.9"></span>Constantius, one evening gave <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.10"></span>Constantine a warrant to depart, and
commanded him to set out next morning with the imperial despatches.
<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.11"></span>Galerius meant either to find some
pretext for detaining <span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.12"></span>Constantine, or
to forward orders to <span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.13"></span>Severus for
arresting him on the road. <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.14"></span>Constantine discerned his purpose; and
therefore, after supper, when the emperor was gone to rest, he hasted
away, carried off from the principal stages all the horses maintained at
the public expense, and escaped. Next day the emperor, having purposely
remained in his bed-chamber until noon, ordered <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.15"></span>Constantine to be called into his presence;
but he learnt that <span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.16"></span>Constantine had
set out immediately after supper. Outrageous with passion, he ordered
horses to be made ready, that <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.17"></span>Constantine might be pursued and dragged
back; and hearing that all the horses had been carried off from the
great road, he could hardly refrain from tears. Meanwhile <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.18"></span>Constantine, journeying with incredible
rapidity, reached his father, who was already about to expire. <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.19"></span>Constantius recommended his son to the
soldiers, delivered the sovereign authority into his hands, and then
died, as his wish had long been, in peace and quiet.  

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p2"></span><span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Constantine Augustus, having assumed the
government, made it his first care to restore the Christians to the
exercise of their worship and to their God; and so began his
administration by reinstating <span id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md)
the holy religion.
