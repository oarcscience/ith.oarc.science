#### <span id="iii.ii.v.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIV.—Of the Fortitude of the Christians.

<span id="iii.ii.v.xiv-p1"></span>But this is true virtue, which the
vaunting philosophers also boast of, not in deed, but with empty words,
saying that nothing is so befitting the gravity and constancy of a wise
man as to be able to be driven away from his sentiment and purpose by no
torturers, but that it is worth his while <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) to suffer torture and death rather
than betray a trust or depart from his duty, or, overcome by fear of
death or severity of pain, commit any injustice. Unless by chance <span
id="iii.ii.v.xiv-p2.2"></span>Flaccus appears to them to rave in his
lyrics, when he says,  

> <span id="iii.ii.v.xiv-p2.3"></span> “Not the rage of the million
> commanding things evil;  
> Not the doom frowning near in the brows of the tyrant,  
> Shakes the upright and resolute man  
> In his solid completeness of soul.” <span
> id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.v.xiv-p4"></span>And nothing can be more true than
this, if it is referred to those who refuse no tortures, no kind of
death, that they may not turn aside from faith and justice; who do not
tremble at the commands of tyrants nor the swords of rulers, <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) so as not to maintain true and
solid liberty with constancy of mind, which wisdom is to be observed in
this alone. For who is so arrogant, who so lifted up, as to forbid me to
raise my eyes to heaven? Who can impose upon me the necessity either of
worshipping that which I am unwilling to worship, or of abstaining from
the worship of that which I wish to worship? What further will now be
left to us, if even this, which must be done of one’s own will, <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) shall be extorted from me by the
caprice of another? No one will effect this, if we have any courage to
despise death and pain. But if we possess this constancy, why are we
judged foolish when we do those things which philosophers praise? <span
id="iii.ii.v.xiv-p6.2"></span>Seneca, in charging men with
inconsistency, rightly says the highest virtue appears to them to
consist in greatness of spirit; and yet the same persons regard him who
despises death as a madman, which is plainly a mark of the greatest
perverseness. But those followers of vain <span id="page_150">p.
150</span> <span id="iii.ii.v.xiv-Page_150"></span>religions urge this
with the same folly with which they fail to understand the true God; and
these the <span id="iii.ii.v.xiv-p6.3"></span>Erythræan Sibyl calls
“deaf and senseless,” <span id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) since
they neither hear nor perceive divine things, but fear and adore an
earthen image moulded by their own fingers.
