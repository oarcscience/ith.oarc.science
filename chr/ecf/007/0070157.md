#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.xix-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIX.—Of the Affections and Their Use; And of the Three Furies.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xix-p1"></span>When the Stoics attempt to uproot the
affections from man as diseases, they are opposed by the Peripatetics,
who not only retain, but also defend them, and say that there is nothing
in man which is not produced in him with great reason and foresight.
They say this indeed rightly, if they know the true limits of each
subject. Accordingly they say that this very affection of anger is the
whetstone of virtue, as though no one could fight bravely against
enemies unless he were excited by anger; by which they plainly show that
they neither know what virtue is, nor why God gave anger to man. And if
this was given to us for this purpose, that we may employ it for the
slaying of men, what is to be thought more savage than man, what more
resembling the wild beasts, than that animal which God formed for
communion and innocence? There are, then, three affections which drive
men headlong to all crimes: (1) anger, (2) desire, and (3) lust. <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221) On which account the poets have
said that there are three furies which harass the minds of men: anger
longs for revenge, desire for riches, lust for pleasures. But God has
appointed fixed limits to all of these; and if they pass these limits
and begin to be too great, they must necessarily pervert their nature,
and be changed into diseases and vices. And it is a matter of no great
labour to show what these limits are. <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222) Cupidity <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223) is given us for providing those
things which are necessary for life; concupiscence, <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224) for the procreation of offspring;
the affection of indignation, <span id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225)
for restraining the faults of those who are in our power, that is, in
order that tender age may be formed by a severer discipline to integrity
and justice: for if this <span id="iii.ii.vi.xix-p6.1"></span>time of
life is not restrained by fear, <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226) licence will produce boldness, and
this will break out into every disgraceful and daring action. Therefore,
as it is both just and necessary to employ anger towards the young, so
it is both pernicious and impious to use it towards those of our own
age. It is impious, because humanity is injured; pernicious, because if
they oppose, it is necessary either to destroy them or to perish. But
that this which I have spoken of is the reason why the affection of
anger has been given to man, may be understood from the precepts of God
Himself, who commands that we should not be angry with those who revile
and injure us, but that we should always have our hands over the young;
that is, that when they err, we should correct them with continual
stripes, <span id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227) lest by useless love
and excessive indulgence they should be trained to evil and nourished to
vices. But those who are inexperienced in affairs and ignorant of
reason, have expelled those affections which have been given to man for
good uses, and they wander more widely than reason demands. <span
id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span
id="iii.ii.vi.xix-Page_186"></span>From this cause they live unjustly
and impiously. They employ anger against their equals in age: hence
disagreements, hence banishments, hence wars have arisen contrary to
justice. They use desire for the amassing of riches: hence frauds, hence
robberies, hence all kinds of crimes have originated. They use lust only
for the enjoyment of pleasures: hence debaucheries, hence adulteries,
hence all corruptions have proceeded. Whoever, therefore, has reduced
those affections within their proper limits, which they who are ignorant
of God cannot do, he is patient, he is brave, he is just. <span

<span id="iii.ii.vi.xix-p3.2"></span>cupidity, while amounting to honest
<span id="iii.ii.vi.xix-p3.3"></span>thrift, is not evil; and <span
