#### <span id="xii.v-p0.1"></span>ELUCIDATIONS.

##### <span id="xii.v-p0.2"></span>I.

<span id="xii.v-p1"></span>(Disciple of the holy <span
id="xii.v-p1.1"></span>Peter, p. 551.)  

<span id="xii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xii.v-p2.1"></span>The</span> early use of the originals of this
liturgy in the Alexandrian patriarchate accounts for its bearing the
name of St. <span id="xii.v-p2.2"></span>Mark,—“sister’s son to <span
id="xii.v-p2.3"></span>Barnabas,” as St. <span
id="xii.v-p2.4"></span>Paul calls him. <span
id="fr_4266"></span>[4267](#fn_4266.md) That he was St. <span
id="xii.v-p3.2"></span>Peter’s pupil may be inferred from that Apostle’s
language, <span id="fr_4267"></span>[4268](#fn_4267.md) —”<span
id="xii.v-p4.3"></span>Marcus, my son.” See <span
id="xii.v-p4.4"></span>Clement’s testimony concerning him (with <span
id="xii.v-p4.5"></span>Eusebius) in vol. ii. pp. 579, 580, this series.
That he founded the “Evangelical See,” though resting on great historic
authority, <span id="fr_4268"></span>[4269](#fn_4268.md) seems to be
doubted in our times by some. <span id="page_569">p. 569</span> <span
id="xii.v-Page_569"></span>  

#### <span id="xii.v-p5.5"></span>II.

<span id="xii.v-p6"></span>(Our holy father <span
id="xii.v-p6.1"></span>Mark, p. 556.)  

<span id="xii.v-p7"></span>While St. <span id="xii.v-p7.1"></span>Mark
could not have written this, it may, of course, have been added at a
very early date. <span id="fr_4269"></span>[4270](#fn_4269.md) This most
touching prayer bears marks of great antiquity, the reference to our
“Christ-loving sovereign” comporting better with the early enthusiasm
inspired by <span id="xii.v-p8.3"></span>Constantine’s conversion than
with the disappointments incurred under his Arianizing or apostate
successors. Now, this commemoration of St. <span
id="xii.v-p8.4"></span>Mark would of itself attach his name to the
liturgy.  

<span id="xii.v-p9"></span>But here is the place to note the principles
of these primitive prayers for saints departed. (1) They could only be
offered in behalf of the holy dead who had fallen asleep in full
communion with Christ and His Church; (2) They were not prayers for
their deliverance out of one place into another; (3) They recognised the
<span id="xii.v-p9.1"></span>repose (not yet the <span
id="xii.v-p9.2"></span>triumph) of the faithful departed as incomplete,
and hence (4) invoked for them a blessed consummation of peace and joy
in the resurrection.  

<span id="xii.v-p10"></span>Now, all this is fatal to the Roman dogmas
and usages, because (1) they thus include St. <span
id="xii.v-p10.1"></span>Mark and the Blessed Virgin in these
commemorations; while Rome teaches, not only that these great saints
went immediately to the excellent glory, and there have reigned with
Christ ever since they died, but (2) that on this very ground, and that
of their <span id="xii.v-p10.2"></span>supererogatory merits, the
Pontiff holds a purse <span id="fr_4270"></span>[4271](#fn_4270.md) of
their excessive righteousness to dispense to meaner Christians.  

<span id="xii.v-p12"></span>St. <span id="xii.v-p12.1"></span>Augustine
speaks of his dear <span id="xii.v-p12.2"></span>Nebridius as in <span
id="xii.v-p12.3"></span>Abraham’s bosom, <span
id="fr_4271"></span>[4272](#fn_4271.md) but finds comfort in commemorating
him and <span id="xii.v-p13.3"></span>Monica his mother, “because it is
so comfortable.” This is his idea, in a word: “<span
class="Foreign"><span id="xii.v-p13.4"></span>Et credo jam feceris quod
te rogo, sed</span> ([Ps. cxix.
108](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#108)<span id="xii.v-p13.5"></span>.md)
<span id="xii.v-p13.6"></span>voluntaria oris mei, approba, Domine.”  

#### <span id="xii.v-p13.7"></span>III.

<span id="xii.v-p14"></span>(Holy things for the holy, p. 559.)  

<span id="xii.v-p15"></span><span id="xii.v-p15.1"></span>Bingham <span
id="fr_4272"></span>[4273](#fn_4272.md) has so fully elucidated this by
quotations from <span id="xii.v-p16.2"></span>Chrysostom (Hom. vii.) and
others, that one might think it useless to attach to it any other
meaning than that which <span id="xii.v-p16.3"></span>Chrysostom
understands in it; viz., “Holy things for holy persons.” It occurs just
before the communicating of the faithful, and has nothing whatever to do
with the “elevation of the host,”—a Western ceremony of the fourteenth
century. <span id="fr_4273"></span>[4274](#fn_4273.md) Yet, in an otherwise
(generally) useful manual of liturgies, an attempt is made to give it
this meaning; and the preceding prayer of “Intense Adoration,” addressed
to the Great High Priest in the heavens, is debased to eke out the weak
idea. Nothing could be more averse to the primitive principle of
worship; <span id="fr_4274"></span>[4275](#fn_4274.md) but it is sufficient
to note the fact that the “elevation of the host” revolutionized the
eucharistic worship of the West as soon as it was established. (1) It
abolished the Eucharist practically as the <span class="Foreign"><span
id="xii.v-p18.2"></span>synaxis</span>, or communion of the faithful,
and made it only a sacrifice <span id="xii.v-p18.3"></span>for them in
their behalf; (2) not to be eaten and received, but to be gazed at; (3)
not for all the faithful at all times, excluding even catechumens from
beholding it, but to be displayed to all eyes in pompous ceremonials,
carried through the streets, and dispensed only in half-communion, once
a year, to the individual communicant. All these ancient liturgies,
corrupted as they are in all the <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.v-p18.4"></span>mss</span>. we possess, are yet liturgies for
communicating the faithful, in their turns, <span
id="fr_4275"></span>[4276](#fn_4275.md) one and all; and, so far, they are
true to the Scriptures and the precepts of Christ and His Apostles. But
well does the pious <span id="xii.v-p19.5"></span>Hirscher exclaim, with
reference to <span id="page_570">p. 570</span> <span
id="xii.v-Page_570"></span>the Mass, as he was obliged to celebrate it
in his own gorgeous cathedral at Freiburg in the Breisgau: “What would
an Apostle think we were doing, should he enter during our ceremonies?”
Also, “I know all that can be said in their favour. I know just as well
that by them <span id="xii.v-p19.6"></span>the spirit is turned apart
from internal godliness, and borne away; and that, with such appeals to
sense, withdrawal from things of sense becomes impossible.…God is a
Spirit: He looks to be adored<span id="xii.v-p19.7"></span> in spirit
and in truth, and all ceremonial which dulls the adoration <span
id="fr_4276"></span>[4277](#fn_4276.md) of the spirit is odious to God. To
glorify self, as His minister, before the King of kings, before the
majesty of the Creator, before His Christ, naked and crucified,—is it
not an absurdity, a ceremony of contradictions? The people no longer
comprehend the ceremonial…to see them satisfied by mere corporal
attendance, is it not deplorable? They do not understand Latin. Is it
not melancholy that they take no real part in the touching offices of
the Holy Week? Is not a deplorable indifference the result; in France,
for example? Nay, at Rome also?” <span
id="fr_4277"></span>[4278](#fn_4277.md)  

<span id="xii.v-p22"></span>His remonstrances were vain; he was cruelly
censured, yet he died in the Papal communion. Dear <span
id="xii.v-p22.1"></span>Hirscher! The venerable man kissed me when I
parted from him in 1851, <span id="fr_4278"></span>[4279](#fn_4278.md) and
gave me his blessing with a primitive spirit of Christian charity. I
gratefully quote him here.  

<span id="xii.v-p24"></span>In Germany a passing stranger often sees the
pious peasantry at Mass, singing with all their hearts their beautiful
German hymns. It misleads, however. They are not attending to the Mass,
but consoling themselves by spiritual songs, while it goes on without
their assistance. The bell rings: they adore the host, but that is all
their relation to the worship of the Christian liturgies. <span
id="xii.v-p24.1"></span>Hirscher loved their hymns, but bewailed the
utter loss of their liturgic communion, once common to the
faithful. <span id="fr_4279"></span>[4280](#fn_4279.md)  

#### <span id="xii.v-p25.2"></span>IV.

<span id="xii.v-p26"></span>(Teachers of the Easterns, etc., p. 561.)  

<span id="xii.v-p27"></span>The apostle <span
id="xii.v-p27.1"></span>Thaddeus is called <span
id="xii.v-p27.2"></span>Addai in Syriac. <span
id="xii.v-p27.3"></span>Maris is said to have been one of the seventy
disciples, but his name is not on the list ascribed to <span
id="xii.v-p27.4"></span>Hippolytus. He was the first bishop of the
people now called “Nestorians,” but whom Dr. <span
id="xii.v-p27.5"></span>Badger <span
id="fr_4280"></span>[4281](#fn_4280.md) prefers to call “the Christians of
Assyria.”  

<span id="xii.v-p29"></span>We have this liturgy in another form in Dr.
<span id="xii.v-p29.1"></span>Badger’s important work, <span
id="xii.v-p29.2"></span>Nestorians and their Rituals. He selects that
called “the Liturgy of <span id="xii.v-p29.3"></span>Nestorius” from
three which are in use among the Assyrians, but criticises the
translation of <span id="xii.v-p29.4"></span>Renaudot as not entirely
faultless. It is selected by Dr. <span id="xii.v-p29.5"></span>Badger
because of its reputed Nestorianism; while <span
id="xii.v-p29.6"></span>Hammond gives us what is here translated, in
<span id="xii.v-p29.7"></span>Renaudot’s Latin. <span
id="fr_4281"></span>[4282](#fn_4281.md) We must bear in mind, that, since
the Ephesine Council (<span class="sc"><span
id="xii.v-p30.1"></span>a.d.</span> 431), these Christians have been
separated from the communion of Eastern orthodoxy.  

<span id="xii.v-p31"></span>The Malabar Liturgy should be carefully
compared with this by the student. A convenient translation of it is to
be found in <span id="xii.v-p31.1"></span>Neale and <span
id="xii.v-p31.2"></span>Littledale. A most important fact, by the way,
is noted in their translation; <span
id="fr_4282"></span>[4283](#fn_4282.md) viz., that in this <span
id="xii.v-p32.1"></span>Malabar “the invocation of the Holy Ghost, <span
id="xii.v-p32.2"></span>contrary to the use of every other Oriental
liturgy, preceded the words of institution;” that is to say, in the work
of <span id="xii.v-p32.3"></span>the Portuguese revisers, a work from
which Dr. <span id="xii.v-p32.4"></span>Neale and his colleague feel
justified in making “a considerable alteration” as to the order of the
prayers.  

<span id="xii.v-p33"></span>The words of institution are found in the
<span id="xii.v-p33.1"></span>Malabar, and suggest that they belong not
less to this Liturgy of the Assyrians, though, <span
id="xii.v-p33.2"></span>ex summa verecundia, <span
id="fr_4283"></span>[4284](#fn_4283.md) they are omitted from the
transcript, as the Lord’s Prayer is omitted in the Clementine. <span
id="page_571">p. 571</span> <span id="xii.v-Page_571"></span>  

<span id="xii.v-p35"></span>The normal form of this corrupted liturgy is
credited with extreme antiquity by Dr. <span
id="xii.v-p35.1"></span>Neale. To his learned and cogent reasoning on
the subject the student should by all means refer. <span
id="fr_4284"></span>[4285](#fn_4284.md)  

#### <span id="xii.v-p36.2"></span>V.

<span id="xii.v-p37"></span>(For all the prophets and confessors, p.
565.)  

<span id="xii.v-p38"></span>These commemorations of the dead, it will be
noted, are in behalf of the most glorious apostles and saints, and for
martyrs who go straight to glory. Obviously, as Usher has said, <span
id="fr_4285"></span>[4286](#fn_4285.md) for whatever purpose, then, the
departed were commemorated, it was not to change their estate before the
resurrection, much less to relieve them from purgatorial penalties. This
comes out in the “Liturgy of St. Chrysostom” (so called), where it is
said: “We offer to Thee this reasonable service for those who have
fallen asleep in faith,…patriarchs, apostles, evangelists, martyrs,…and
every <span id="xii.v-p39.2"></span>just one made perfect <span
id="xii.v-p39.3"></span>in the faith: <span
id="xii.v-p39.4"></span>especially our all-holy, undefiled, most blessed
Lady, <span id="xii.v-p39.5"></span>Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary,”
etc. But she, they tell us, was <span id="xii.v-p39.6"></span>assumed
into glory, like Christ Himself, and reigns with Him as “Queen of
Angels,” etc. See Elucidation II. p. 569.  

#### <span id="xii.v-p39.7"></span>VI.

<span id="xii.v-p40"></span>(The propitiatory blood, etc., p. 566.)  

<span id="xii.v-p41"></span>The peril of confounding the early use of
this idea of propitiation with the mediæval theory, which is quite
another, is well pointed out and enforced by <span
id="xii.v-p41.1"></span>Burbidge. <span
id="fr_4286"></span>[4287](#fn_4286.md) The primitive writers and the
ancient liturgies “do not regard the Eucharist as being <span
id="xii.v-p42.2"></span>itself a propitiatory offering,” but it is the
perpetual pleading of the blood of propitiation once offered. Thus St.
<span id="xii.v-p42.3"></span>Chrysostom: “We do not offer another
sacrifice, but <span id="xii.v-p42.4"></span>always the same.” So far,
his words might be quoted to favour the Middle-Age doctrine; but he
guards himself, and adds: <span id="fr_4287"></span>[4288](#fn_4287.md)
“or, <span id="xii.v-p43.3"></span>rather, we make a memorial of the
sacrifice.”  

<span id="xii.v-p44"></span>The rhetoric of the liturgies and of the
Fathers was unhappily made into the logic of the Schoolmen, and hence
the stupendous system of propitiatory Masses, with Masses for the dead,
and that traffic in Masses which so fearfully defiles the priesthood of
Western Europe and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in America. In
vain does the pious <span id="xii.v-p44.1"></span>Hirscher
complain: <span id="fr_4288"></span>[4289](#fn_4288.md) “The rich, then,
are the happy sinners in this respect: they can buy innumerable Masses,
and establish them in perpetuity; their privileges have no limit, and
their advantages over the poor extend through all eternity.” His book
was put into the Index ([Acts 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019.md),
[Acts 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md)<span
id="xii.v-p45.2"></span>), but it was never answered.  

#### <span id="xii.v-p45.3"></span>VII.

<span id="xii.v-p46"></span> Let me now recur to Elucidation III. on p.
507, to which I would here add the following from Bishop Williams, as
there quoted:—  

<span id="xii.v-p47"></span>“In both the Mozarabic and the Gallican
Liturgies there was an invocation as well as an oblation. <span
id="xii.v-p47.1"></span>Irenæus <span
id="fr_4289"></span>[4290](#fn_4289.md) says (and he, writing at Lyons,
must have in mind the Gallican Liturgy), ‘The bread which is of the
earth, having received the <span id="xii.v-p48.2"></span>invocation of
God, is no longer common bread, but the Eucharist.’ The word translated
‘invocation’ is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.v-p48.3"></span>ἐπίκλησιν</span>; and it is worthy of notice
that <span id="xii.v-p48.4"></span>Basil and <span
id="xii.v-p48.5"></span>Cyril of Jerusalem use the same word in
evidently the same technical sense (<span
id="xii.v-p48.6"></span>Harvey’s <span id="xii.v-p48.7"></span>Irenæus,
vol. ii. pp. 205–207 and notes). In another passage <span
id="xii.v-p48.8"></span>Irenæus <span
id="fr_4290"></span>[4291](#fn_4290.md) speaks even more distinctly: ‘We
offer to God the bread and the cup of blessing, giving thanks to Him for
that He hath commanded the earth to bring forth these fruits for our
nourishment; and, having finished the offering, <span id="page_572">p.
572</span> <span id="xii.v-Page_572"></span>we invoke the Holy Spirit
that He may exhibit (or declare, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.v-p49.2"></span>ἀποφήνῃ</span>) this sacrifice and bread the
body of Christ, and the cup the blood of Christ, that they who shall
receive these antitypes may obtain remission of sins and everlasting
life’ (<span id="xii.v-p49.3"></span>Harvey’s <span
id="xii.v-p49.4"></span>Irenæus, vol. ii. p. 502). This passage is a
remarkable one. It proves beyond question, that, in the time of <span
id="xii.v-p49.5"></span>Irenæus (<span id="xii.v-p49.6"></span>d. <span
class="sc"><span id="xii.v-p49.7"></span>a.d.</span> 202 or 208), the
Liturgy of Gaul contained an invocation of the Holy Ghost following the
oblation of the bread and cup. Moreover, when we compare the words of
<span id="xii.v-p49.8"></span>Irenæus with those of the Clementine
Liturgy, their agreement is too clear and precise to be explained as a
mere chance-matter. The liturgy reads, ‘Send down Thy Holy Spirit on
this sacrifice, the witness of the sufferings of the Lord <span
id="xii.v-p49.9"></span>Jesus, that He may exhibit (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xii.v-p49.10"></span>ἀποφήνῃ</span>) this bread,
the body of Thy Christ, and this cup, the blood of Thy Christ, that they
who shall receive,’ <span id="fr_4291"></span>[4292](#fn_4291.md) etc.
<span id="xii.v-p50.2"></span>Irenæus says as above, using the same word
(<span class="Greek"><span id="xii.v-p50.3"></span>ἀποφήνῃ</span>), a
word which is found, it is believed, in no liturgy but the Clementine.”
 

<span id="xii.v-p51"></span>Now I humbly suggest that <span
id="xii.v-p51.1"></span>Justin Martyr and <span
id="xii.v-p51.2"></span>Irenæus <span id="xii.v-p51.3"></span>concur in
giving us evidence that the <span id="xii.v-p51.4"></span>Clementine
Liturgy is substantially that which was used in Rome and Gaul in their
times. The latter may have received it from <span
id="xii.v-p51.5"></span>Polycarp. The use of the Roman and the Greek
churches was uniform in his day, as may be inferred from the intercourse
of <span id="xii.v-p51.6"></span>Polycarp and <span
id="xii.v-p51.7"></span>Victor. <span
