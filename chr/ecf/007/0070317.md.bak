#### <span id="iii.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chap. VIII.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p1"></span>What was the character of his brother in
empire, <span id="iii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Maximian, called <span
id="iii.v.viii-p1.2"></span>Herculius? Not unlike to that of <span
id="iii.v.viii-p1.3"></span>Diocletian; and, indeed, to render <span
id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span id="iii.v.viii-Page_304"></span>their
friendship so close and faithful as it was, there must have been in them
a sameness of inclinations and purposes, a corresponding will and
unanimity in judgment. Herein alone they were different, that <span
id="iii.v.viii-p1.4"></span>Diocletian was more avaricious and less
resolute, and that <span id="iii.v.viii-p1.5"></span>Maximian, with less
avarice, had a bolder spirit, prone not to good, but to evil. For while
he possessed Italy, itself the chief seat of empire, and while other
very opulent provinces, such as Africa and Spain, were near at hand, he
took little care to preserve those treasures which he had such fair
opportunities of amassing. Whenever he stood in need of more, the
richest senators were presently charged, by suborned evidences, as
guilty of aspiring to the empire; so that the chief luminaries of the
senate were daily extinguished. And thus the treasury, delighting in
blood, overflowed with ill-gotten wealth.  

<span id="iii.v.viii-p2"></span>Add to all this the incontinency of that
pestilent wretch, not only in debauching males, which is hateful and
abominable, but also in the violation of the daughters of the principal
men of the state; for wherever he journeyed, virgins were suddenly torn
from the presence of their parents. In such enormities he placed his
supreme delight, and to indulge to the utmost his lust and flagitious
desires was in his judgment the felicity of his reign.  

<span id="iii.v.viii-p3"></span>I pass over <span
id="iii.v.viii-p3.1"></span>Constantius, a prince unlike the others, and
worthy to have had the sole government of the empire.
