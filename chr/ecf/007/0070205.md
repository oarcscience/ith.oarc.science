#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XII.—The Poets Do Not Invent All Those Things Which Relate to the Gods.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1"></span>You see, then, that the poets did
not invent all things, and that they prefigured some things, that, when
they spoke the truth, they might add something like this of divinity to
those whom they called gods; as they did also respecting their kingdoms.
For when they say that <span id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Jupiter
had by lot the kingdom of <span id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.2"></span>Cœlus,
they either menu Mount Olympus, on which ancient stories relate that
<span id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.3"></span>Saturnus, and afterwards <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.4"></span>Jupiter, dwelt, or a part of the East,
which is, as it were, higher, because the light arises thence; but the
region of the West is lower, and therefore they say that <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.5"></span>Pluto obtained the lower regions; but
that the sea was given to <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-p1.6"></span>Neptune, because he <span
id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span
id="iii.ii.viii.xiii-Page_228"></span>had the maritime coast, with all
the islands. Many things are thus coloured by the poets; and they who
are ignorant of this, censure them as false, but only in word: for in
fact they believe them, since they so fashion the images of the gods,
that when they make them male and female, and confess that some are
married, some parents, and some children, they plainly assent to the
poets; for these relations cannot exist without intercourse and the
generation of children.
