### <span id="v.ii-p1.1"></span>The Extant Writings of Asterius Urbanus <span id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md)

#### <span id="v.ii-p2.4"></span>i. the exordium.

<span id="v.ii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.ii-p3.1"></span>Having</span> now for a very long and surely a
very sufficient period had the charge pressed upon me by thee, my dear
Avircius <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md) <span
id="v.ii-p4.6"></span>Marcellus, to write some sort of treatise against
the heresy that bears the name of Miltiades, <span
id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159.md) I have somehow been very doubtfully
disposed toward the task up till now; not that I felt any difficulty in
refuting the falsehood, and in bearing my testimony to the truth, but
that I was apprehensive and fearful lest I should appear to any to be
adding some new word or precept <span
id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md) to the doctrine of the Gospel of
the New Testament, with respect to which indeed it is not possible for
one who has chosen to have his manner of life in accordance with the
Gospel itself, either to add anything to it or to take away anything
from it. Being recently, however, at Ancyra, a town of Galatia, and
finding the church in Pontus <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md)
greatly agitated <span id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md) by this new
prophecy, as they call it, but which should rather be called this false
prophecy, as shall be shown presently, I discoursed to the best of my
ability, with the help of God, for many days in the church, both on
these subjects and on various others <span
id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md) which were brought under my notice
by them. And this I did in such manner that the church rejoiced and was
strengthened in the truth, while the adversaries <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md) were forthwith routed, and the
opponents put to grief. And the presbyters of the place accordingly
requested us to leave behind us some memorandum of the things which we
alleged in opposition to the adversaries of the truth, there being
present also our fellow-presbyter <span id="v.ii-p10.3"></span>Zoticus
Otrenus. <span id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md) This, however, we
did not; but we promised, if the Lord gave us opportunity, to write down
the matters here, and send them to them with all speed.  

##### <span id="v.ii-p11.8"></span>ii. from book i.

<span id="v.ii-p12"></span>Now the attitude of opposition <span
id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md) which they have assumed, and this
new heresy of theirs which puts them in a position of separation from
the Church, had their origin in the following manner. There is said to
be a certain village called Ardaba <span
id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167.md) in the Mysia, which touches
Phrygia. <span id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168.md) There, they say, one
of those who had been but recently converted to the faith, a person of
the name of <span id="v.ii-p15.6"></span>Montanus, when <span
id="v.ii-p15.7"></span>Gratus was proconsul of Asia, gave the adversary
entrance against himself by the excessive lust of his soul after taking
the lead. And this person was carried away in spirit; <span
id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169.md) and suddenly being seized with a
kind of frenzy and ecstasy, he raved, and began to speak and to utter
strange things, and to prophesy in a manner contrary to the custom of
the Church, as handed down from early times and preserved thenceforward
in a continuous succession. And among those who were present on that
occasion, and heard those spurious utterances, there were some who were
indignant, and rebuked him as one frenzied, and under the power of
demons, and possessed by the spirit of delusion, and agitating the
multitude, and debarred him from speaking any more; for they were
mindful of the Lord’s <span id="page_336">p. 336</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_336"></span>distinction <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170.md) and threatening, whereby He warned
them to be on their guard vigilantly against the coming of the false
prophets. But there were others too, who, as if elated by the Holy
Spirit and the prophetic gift, and not a little puffed up, and
forgetting entirely the Lord’s distinction, challenged the maddening and
insidious and seductive spirit, being themselves cajoled and misled by
him, so that there was no longer any checking him to silence. <span
id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171.md) And thus by a kind of artifice, or
rather by such a process of craft, the devil having devised destruction
against those who were disobedient <span id="v.ii-p18.2"></span>to the
Lord’s warning, and being unworthily honoured by them, secretly excited
and inflamed their minds that had already left the faith which is
according to truth, in order to play the harlot with error. <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md) For he stirred up two others also,
women, and filled them with the spurious spirit, so that they too spoke
in a frenzy and unseasonably, and in a strange manner, like the person
already mentioned, while the spirit called them happy as they rejoiced
and exulted proudly at his working, and puffed them up by the magnitude
of his promises; while, on the other hand, at times also he condemned
them skilfully and plausibly, in order that he might seem to them also
to have the power of reproof. <span id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173.md)
And those few who were thus deluded were Phrygians. But the same
arrogant spirit taught them to revile the Church universal under heaven,
because that false spirit of prophecy found neither honour from it nor
entrance into it. For when the faithful throughout Asia met together
often and in many places of Asia for deliberation on this subject, and
subjected those novel doctrines to examination, and declared them to be
spurious, and rejected them as heretical, they were in consequence of
that expelled from the Church and debarred from communion. <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md)  

##### <span id="v.ii-p21.2"></span>iii. from book ii.

<span id="v.ii-p22"></span>Wherefore, since they stigmatized us as
slayers of the prophets <span id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md)
because we did not receive their loquacious <span
id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md) prophets,—for they say that these
are they whom the Lord promised to send to the people,—let them answer
us in the name of God, and tell us, O friends, whether there is any one
among those who began to speak from <span
id="v.ii-p24.7"></span>Montanus and the women onward that was persecuted
by the Jews or put to death by the wicked? There is not one. Not even
one of them is there who was seized and crucified for the name <span
id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md) <span id="v.ii-p25.6"></span>of
Christ. No; certainly not. Neither assuredly was there one of these
women who was ever scourged in the synagogues of the Jews, or stoned.
No; never anywhere. It is indeed by another kind of death that <span
id="v.ii-p25.7"></span>Montanus and <span
id="v.ii-p25.8"></span>Maximilla are said to have met their end. For the
report is, that by the instigation of that maddening spirit both of them
hung themselves; not together indeed, but at the particular time of the
death of each <span id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178.md) as the common
story goes. And thus they died, and finished their life like the traitor
<span id="v.ii-p26.2"></span>Judas. Thus, also, the general report gives
it that <span id="v.ii-p26.3"></span>Theodotus—that astonishing person
who was, so to speak, the first procurator <span
id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179.md) of their so-called prophecy, and
who, as if he were sometime taken up and received into the heavens, fell
into spurious ecstasies, <span id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md) and
gave himself wholly over to the spirit of delusion—was at last tossed by
him <span id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md) into the air, and met his
end miserably. People say then that this took place in the way we have
stated. But as we did not see <span id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182.md)
them ourselves, we do not presume to think that we know any of these
things with certainty. And it may therefore have been in this way
perhaps, and perhaps in some other way, that <span
id="v.ii-p30.3"></span>Montanus and <span
id="v.ii-p30.4"></span>Theodotus and the woman mentioned above perished.
 

##### <span id="v.ii-p30.5"></span>iv.

<span id="v.ii-p31"></span>And let not the spirit of <span
id="v.ii-p31.1"></span>Maximilla say (as it is found in the same book of
<span id="v.ii-p31.2"></span>Asterius Urbanus <span
id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183) .md), “I am chased like a wolf from
the sheep; I am no wolf. I am word, and spirit, and power.” But let him
clearly exhibit and prove the power in the spirit. And by the spirit let
him constrain to a confession those who were present at that time for
the very purpose of trying and holding converse with the talkative
spirit—those men so highly reputed as men and bishops—namely, <span
id="v.ii-p32.5"></span>Zoticus of the village of Comana <span
id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md) , and <span
id="v.ii-p33.6"></span>Julian <span id="page_337">p. 337</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_337"></span>of Apamea, whose mouths <span
id="v.ii-p33.7"></span>Themison <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md) and his followers bridled, and
prevented the false and seductive spirit from being confuted by them.  

##### <span id="v.ii-p34.2"></span>v.

<span id="v.ii-p35"></span>And has not the falsity of this also been
made manifest already? For it is now upwards of thirteen years since the
woman died, and there has arisen neither a partial nor a universal war
in the world. Nay, rather there has been steady and continued peace to
the Christians by the mercy of God.  

##### <span id="v.ii-p35.1"></span>vi. from book iii.

<span id="v.ii-p36"></span>But as they have been refuted in all their
allegations, and are thus at a loss what to say, they try to take refuge
in their martyrs. For they say that they have many martyrs, and that
this is a sure proof of the power of their so-called prophetic spirit.
But this allegation, as it seems, carries not a whit more truth with it
than the others. For indeed some of the other heresies have also a great
multitude of martyrs; but yet certainly we shall not on that account
agree with them, neither shall we acknowledge that they have truth in
them. And those first heretics, who from the heresy of <span
id="v.ii-p36.1"></span>Marcion are called Marcionites, allege that they
have a great multitude of martyrs for Christ. But yet they do not
confess Christ Himself according to truth.  

##### <span id="v.ii-p36.2"></span>vii.

<span id="v.ii-p37"></span>Hence, also, whenever those who have been
called to martyrdom for the true faith by the Church happen to fall in
with any of those so-called martyrs of the Phrygian heresy, they always
separate from them, and die without having fellowship with them, because
they do not choose to give their assent to the spirit of <span
id="v.ii-p37.1"></span>Montanus and the women. And that this is truly
the case, and that it has actually taken place in our own times at
Apamea, a town on the Mæander, in the case of those who suffered
martyrdom with <span id="v.ii-p37.2"></span>Caius <span
id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md) and <span
id="v.ii-p38.18"></span>Alexander, natives of Eumenia, is clear to all.
 

##### <span id="v.ii-p38.19"></span>viii.

<span id="v.ii-p39"></span>As I found these things in a certain writing
of theirs directed against the writing of our brother <span
id="v.ii-p39.1"></span>Alcibiades, <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md) in which he proves the impropriety
of a prophet’s speaking in ecstasy, I made an abridgment of that work.  

##### <span id="v.ii-p40.7"></span>ix.

<span id="v.ii-p41"></span>But the false prophet falls into a spurious
ecstasy, which is accompanied by a want of all shame and fear. For
beginning with a voluntary (designed) rudeness, he ends with an
involuntary madness of soul, as has been already stated. But they will
never be able to show that any one of the Old Testament prophets, or any
one of the New, was carried away in spirit after this fashion. Nor will
they be able to boast that <span id="v.ii-p41.1"></span>Agabus, or <span
id="v.ii-p41.2"></span>Judas, or <span id="v.ii-p41.3"></span>Silas, or
the daughters of <span id="v.ii-p41.4"></span>Philip, or <span
id="v.ii-p41.5"></span>the woman <span id="v.ii-p41.6"></span>Ammia in
Philadelphia, or <span id="v.ii-p41.7"></span>Quadratus, or indeed any
of the others who do not in any respect belong to them, were moved in
this way.  

##### <span id="v.ii-p41.8"></span>x.

<span id="v.ii-p42"></span>For if, after <span
id="v.ii-p42.1"></span>Quadratus and the woman <span
id="v.ii-p42.2"></span>Ammia in Philadelphia, as they say, the women who
attached themselves to <span id="v.ii-p42.3"></span>Montanus succeeded
to the gift of prophecy, let them show us which of them thus succeeded
<span id="v.ii-p42.4"></span>Montanus and his women. For the apostle
deems that the gift of prophecy should abide in all the Church up to the
time of the final advent. But they will not be able to show the gift to
be in their possession even at the present time, which is the fourteenth
year only from the death of <span
id="v.ii-p42.5"></span>Maximilla. <span
id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188.md)  

##### <span id="v.ii-p43.2"></span>general note.

<span id="v.ii-p44"></span><span id="v.ii-p44.1"></span>The reader will
do well to turn back to my Introductory Notice to the <span
id="v.ii-p44.2"></span>Epistle of Hermas, <span
id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189.md) and also to the elucidations <span
id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) which are appended to that Epistle.
If any value attaches to this fragment, it must be found in its
illustrations of <span id="v.ii-p46.3"></span>Hermas and <span
id="v.ii-p46.4"></span>Tertullian. These, in turn, shed light on it.

the fact that the name of <span id="v.ii-p5.4"></span>Miltiades rather
than that of <span id="v.ii-p5.5"></span>Montanus is associated with the
heresy of the Cataphrygians, and some consequently have conjectured that
we should read here <span id="v.ii-p5.6"></span>Alcibiades, as that is a
name mentioned in concert with <span id="v.ii-p5.7"></span>Montanus and
<span id="v.ii-p5.8"></span>Theodotus in Euseb. v. 3. In the Muratorian
fragment, however, as given above among the writings of <span

id="v.ii-p27.2"></span>Rufinus renders it, “<span

id="v.ii-p27.4"></span>Migne takes it as meaning <span
id="v.ii-p27.5"></span>steward, manager of a common fund established
among the Montanists for the support of their prophets. <span
id="v.ii-p27.6"></span>Eusebius (v. 18) quotes <span
id="v.ii-p27.7"></span>Apollonius as saying of <span
id="v.ii-p27.8"></span>Montanus, that he <span

<span id="v.ii-p29"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="v.ii-p30"></span> The text is, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii-p30.1"></span>ἀλλὰ μὴν ἂνευ</span>. But in various codices we
have the more correct reading, <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii-p30.2"></span>ἀλλὰ μὴ ἂνευ</span>.  

<span id="fn_2183"></span>[336:2184](0070371.htm#fr_2183.md) <span
id="v.ii-p31.3"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p32"></span> These words are apparently a <span
id="v.ii-p32.1"></span>scholium, which <span
id="v.ii-p32.2"></span>Eusebius himself or some old commentator had
written on the margin of his copy. We gather also from them that <span
id="v.ii-p32.3"></span>Asterius Urbanus was credited with the authorship
of these three books, and not <span id="v.ii-p32.4"></span>Apollinaris,
as some have supposed.

<span id="v.ii-p33"></span> Comana seems to have been a town of
Pamphylia. At least a bishop of Comana is mentioned in the epistle of
the bishops of Pamphylia to <span id="v.ii-p33.1"></span>Leo Augustus,
cited in the third part of the <span id="v.ii-p33.2"></span>Council of
Chalcedon, p. 391. \[See p. 335, note 9, <span

id="v.ii-p33.8"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p34"></span> <span id="v.ii-p34.1"></span>Themison was a
person of note among the Montanists, who boasted of himself as a
confessor and martyr, and had the audacity to write a catholic epistle
to the churches like an apostle, with the view of commending the new
prophecy to them. See Euseb., v. 18.

<span id="v.ii-p40"></span> <span id="v.ii-p40.1"></span>Migne is of
opinion that there has been an interchange of names between this passage
and the Exordium, and that we should read <span
id="v.ii-p40.2"></span>Miltiades here, and <span
id="v.ii-p40.3"></span>Alcibiades there. But see Exordium, note 3, p.
335. \[And compare <span id="v.ii-p40.5"></span>Eusebius, book v. cap.
3, where two of this name are mentioned; also <span
id="v.ii-p40.6"></span>Ibid., cap. 17.\]

<span id="v.ii-p43"></span> This seems to be the sense of the text,
