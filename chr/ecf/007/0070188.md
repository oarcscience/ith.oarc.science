<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XXIV.—Of the Renewed World.

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p1"></span>Now I will subjoin the rest.
Therefore the Son of the most high and mighty God shall come to judge
the quick and the dead, as the <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Sibyl testifies and says:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p1.2"></span> “For then there shall be
> confusion of mortals throughout the whole earth, when the Almighty
> Himself shall come on His judgment-seat to judge the souls of the
> quick and dead, and all the world.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p2"></span>But He, when He shall have
destroyed unrighteousness, and executed His great judgment, and shall
have recalled to life the righteous, who have lived from the beginning,
will be engaged among men a thousand years, and will rule them with most
just command. Which the <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Sibyl
proclaims in another place, as she utters her inspired predictions:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p2.2"></span> “Hear me, ye mortals; an
> everlasting King reigns.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p3"></span>Then they who shall be alive in
their bodies shall not die, but during those thousand years shall
produce an infinite multitude, and their offspring shall be holy, and
beloved by God; but they who shall be raised from the dead shall preside
over the living as judges. <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420)
But the nations shall not be entirely extinguished, but some shall be
left as a victory for God, that they may be the occasion of triumph to
the righteous, and may be subjected to perpetual slavery. About the same
time also the prince of the devils, who is the contriver of all evils,
shall be bound with chains, and shall be imprisoned during the thousand
years of the heavenly rule in which righteousness shall reign in the
world, so that he may contrive no evil against the people of God. After
His coming the righteous shall be collected from all the earth, and the
judgment being completed, the sacred city shall be planted in the middle
of the earth, in which God Himself the builder may dwell together with
the righteous, bearing rule in it. And the <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p4.6"></span>Sibyl marks out this city when she
says:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p4.7"></span> “And the city which God made,
> this He made more brilliant than the stars, and sun, and moon.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p5"></span>Then that darkness will be taken
away from the world with which the heaven will be overspread and
darkened, and the moon will receive the brightness of the sun, nor will
it be further diminished: but the sun will become seven times brighter
than it now is; and the earth will open its fruitfulness, and bring
forth most abundant fruits of its own accord; the rocky mountains shall
drop with honey; streams of wine shall run down, and rivers flow with
milk: in short, the world itself shall rejoice, and all nature exult,
being rescued and set free from the dominion of evil and impiety, and
guilt and error. Throughout this time beasts shall not be nourished by
blood, nor birds by prey; but all things shall be peaceful and tranquil.
Lions and calves shall stand together at the manger, the wolf shall not
carry off the sheep, the hound shall not hunt for prey; hawks and eagles
shall not injure; the infant shall play with serpents. In short, those
things shall then come to pass which the poets spoke of as being done in
the reign of <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p5.1"></span>Saturnus. Whose
error arose from this source,—that the prophets bring forward and speak
of many future events as already accomplished. For visions were brought
before their eyes by the divine Spirit, and they saw these things, as it
were, done and completed in their own sight. And when fame had gradually
spread abroad their predictions, since those who were uninstructed in
the mysteries <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421) of religion did
not know why they were spoken, they thought that all those things were
already fulfilled in the ancient ages, which evidently could not be
accomplished and fulfilled under the reign of a man. <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422) But when, after the destruction of
impious religions and the suppression of guilt, the earth shall be
subject to God,—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p7.3"></span> “The sailor <span
> id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423) himself also shall renounce the
> sea, nor shall the naval pine  
> Barter merchandise; all lands shall produce all things.  
> The ground shall not endure the harrow, nor the vineyard the pruning
> hook;  
> The sturdy ploughman also shall loose the bulls from the yoke.  
> The plain shall by degrees grow yellow with soft ears of corn,  
> The blushing grape shall hang on the uncultivated brambles,  
> And hard oaks shall distil the dewy honey.  
> Nor shall the wool learn to counterfeit various colours;  
> But the ram himself in the meadows shall change his fleece,  
> Now for a sweetly blushing purple, now for saffron dye;  
> Scarlet of its own accord shall cover the lambs as they feed.  
> The goats of themselves shall bring back home their udders distended
> with milk;  
> Nor shall the herds dread huge lions.” <span
> id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424) <span id="page_220">p. 220</span>
> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-Page_220"></span>  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p10"></span>Which things the poet foretold
according to the verses of the <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p10.1"></span>Cumæan Sibyl. But the <span
id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p10.2"></span>Erythræan thus speaks:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p10.3"></span> “But wolves shall not contend
> with lambs on the mountains, and lynxes shall eat grass with kids;
> boars shall feed with calves, and with all flocks; and the carnivorous
> lion shall eat chaff at the manger, and serpents shall sleep with
> infants deprived of their mothers.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p11"></span>And in another place, speaking of
the fruitfulness of all things:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p11.1"></span> “And then shall God give
> great joy to men; for the earth, and the trees, and the numberless
> flocks of the earth shall give to men the true fruit of the vine, and
> sweet honey, and white milk, and corn, which is the best of all things
> to mortals.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p12"></span>And another in the same manner:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p12.1"></span> “The sacred land of the pious
> only will produce all these things, the stream of honey from the rock
> and from the fountain, and the milk of ambrosia will flow for all the
> just.”  

<span id="iii.ii.vii.xxiv-p13"></span>Therefore men will live a most
tranquil life, abounding with resources, and will reign together with
God; and the kings of the nations shall come from the ends of the earth
with gifts and offerings, to adore and honour the great King, whose name
shall be renowned and venerated by all the nations which shall be under
heaven, and by the kings who shall rule on earth.
