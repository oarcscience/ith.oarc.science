<span id="vi.ii.xvii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>11.
“And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon
him was called Faithful and True.”\] The horse, and He that sits upon
him, sets forth our Lord coming to His kingdom with the heavenly army.

sea of Phœnice, and even to the ends of the earth, they will command
these greater parts in the coming of the Lord <span

be assembled to judgment.
