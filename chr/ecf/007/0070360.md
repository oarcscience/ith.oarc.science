#### <span id="iii.v.li-p0.1"></span>Chap. LI.

<span id="iii.v.li-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.li-p1.1"></span>Valeria,
too, who for fifteen months had wandered under a mean garb from province
to province, was at length discovered in Thessalonica, was apprehended,
together with her mother <span id="iii.v.li-p1.2"></span>Prisca, and
suffered capital punishment. Both the ladies were conducted to
execution; a fall from grandeur which moved the pity of the multitude of
beholders that the strange sight had gathered together. They were
beheaded, and their bodies cast into the sea. Thus the chaste demeanour
of <span id="iii.v.li-p1.3"></span>Valeria, and the high rank of her and
her mother, proved fatal to both of them. <span
