#### <span id="iii.ii.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chap. XX.—Of Philosophy and the Truth.

<span id="iii.ii.ii.xx-p1"></span>A great and difficult portion of the
work which I have undertaken, unless I am deceived, has been completed;
and the majesty of heaven supplying the power of speaking, we have
driven away inveterate errors. But now a greater and more difficult
contest with philosophers is proposed to us, the height of whose
learning and eloquence, as some massive structure, is opposed to me. For
as in the former <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) case we were
oppressed by a multitude, and almost by the universal agreement of all
nations, so in this subject we are oppressed by the authority of men
excelling in every kind of praise. But who can be ignorant that there is
more weight in a smaller number of learned men than in a greater number
of ignorant persons? <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) But we must
not despair that, under the guidance of God and the truth, these also
may be turned aside from their opinion; nor do I think that they will be
so obstinate as to deny that they behold with sound and open eyes the
sun as he shines in his brilliancy. Only let that be true which they
themselves are accustomed to profess, that they are possessed with the
desire of investigation, and I shall assuredly succeed in causing them
to believe that the truth which they have long sought for has been at
length found, and to confess that it could not have been found by the
abilities of man.
