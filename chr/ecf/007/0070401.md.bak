### <span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>Introductory Notice

###### <span id="viii.i-p1.2"></span>To

## <span id="viii.i-p1.3"></span>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span><span id="viii.i-p3.1"></span>The interest
so generally excited in the learned world by the (“Bryennios”) discovery
of a very primitive document, rendered it indispensable that this
republication should be enriched by it, in connection with the <span
id="viii.i-p3.2"></span>Apostolic Constitutions (so called), which had
been reserved for the concluding volume of the series. The critics were
greatly divided as to the genuineness of the <span
id="viii.i-p3.3"></span>Bryennios <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.i-p3.4"></span>ms</span> ; and, in order to gain time, I had
relegated the <span id="viii.i-p3.5"></span>Constitutions, with this
document as its sequel or its preface, to a place with the <span
id="viii.i-p3.6"></span>Apocrypha Dissatisfied with my own impressions
and conjectures, I soon decided that the task of editing the <span
id="viii.i-p3.7"></span>Teaching, as the Bryennios document is entitled,
must be entrusted to an “expert,” and that, if possible, it should be
taken in hand with the <span id="viii.i-p3.8"></span>Constitutions In
order to give sufficient time, I entrusted the task, a year ago, to the
well-qualified head and hands of Professor <span
id="viii.i-p3.9"></span>Riddle of Hartford, who most kindly accepted my
proposals, and who now enables me to present his completed work to the
public with the volume to which it properly belongs. It will be hailed
by literary men generally as a timely reviewal of the whole subject, nor
should I be surprised to find Dr. <span
id="viii.i-p3.10"></span>Riddle’s estimate of the <span
id="viii.i-p3.11"></span>Teaching accepted as the most important
contribution yet made to the literature of inquiry touching its worth
and character. Appearing, as it does in this place, in close relations
with the <span id="viii.i-p3.12"></span>Constitutions, and with the
editorial comparisons so felicitously introduced by the learned
annotator, the student will find himself in a position to weigh and to
decide for himself all the questions that have been raised in previous
examinations of the case. Without risking any judgment of my own upon
the decisions which have been reached by Dr. <span
id="viii.i-p3.13"></span>Riddle in the exercise of his great critical
skill, I cannot withhold an expression of gratitude for the impartiality
and scientific conscientiousness with which he has handled the matter.
Uninfluenced by prepossessions, he presents the case with judicial
calmness and with due consideration of what others have suggested. I am
gratified to find that impressions of my own are strengthened by his
conclusions. In an early notice of the Bryennios discovery, contributed
to a leading publication, I stated my surmise that the <span
id="viii.i-p3.14"></span>Teaching, and its parallels in the <span
id="viii.i-p3.15"></span>Constitutions and other primitive writings,
would prove to be based upon some original document, common to all. Even
<span id="viii.i-p3.16"></span>Lactantius, in his <span
id="viii.i-p3.17"></span>Institutes, shapes his instructions to <span
id="viii.i-p3.18"></span>Constantine by the <span
id="viii.i-p3.19"></span>Duœ Viœ, which seem to have been formulated in
the earliest ages for the training of catechumens. The elementary nature
and the “childishness” of the work are thus accounted for, and I am sure
that the “mystagogic” teaching of <span id="viii.i-p3.20"></span>Cyril
receives light from this view of the matter. This work was “food for
lambs:” it was not meant to meet the wants of those “of full age.” It
may prove, as Dr. <span id="viii.i-p3.21"></span>Riddle hints, that the
<span id="viii.i-p3.22"></span>Teaching as we have it, in the Bryennios
document, is tainted by the views of some nascent sect or heresy, or by
the incompetency of some obscure local church as yet unvisited by
learned teachers and evangelists. It seems to me not improbably
influenced by views of the <span class="Foreign"><span
id="viii.i-p3.23"></span>charismata</span>, which ripened into
Montanism, and which are illustrated by the warnings and admonitions of
<span id="viii.i-p3.24"></span>Hermas. <span

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span> The reader has observed that all my notes,
except the “General Notes,” are bracketed when they illustrate any other
text except that of my own original prefaces, elucidations, etc. This
rule will apply to Professor <span id="viii.i-p4.1"></span>Riddle’s
work, as well as to that of the Edinburgh translator’s.
