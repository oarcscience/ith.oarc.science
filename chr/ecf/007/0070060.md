#### <span id="iii.ii.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chap. IX.—Of the Chief Good, and the Worship of the True God, and a Refutation of Anaxagoras.

<span id="iii.ii.iii.ix-p1"></span>I now come to the chief good of true
wisdom, the nature of which is to be determined in this manner: first,
it must be the property of man alone, and not belong to any other
animal; secondly, it must belong to the soul only, and <span
id="page_77">p. 77</span> <span id="iii.ii.iii.ix-Page_77"></span>not be
shared with the body; lastly, it cannot fall to the lot of any one
without knowledge and virtue. Now this limitation excludes and does away
with all the opinions of those <span id="iii.ii.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>whom
I have mentioned<span id="iii.ii.iii.ix-p1.2"></span>; for their sayings
contain nothing of this kind. I will now say what this is, that I may
show, as I designed, that all philosophers were blind and foolish, who
could neither see, nor understand, nor surmise at any time what was
fixed as the chief good for man. <span
id="iii.ii.iii.ix-p1.3"></span>Anaxagoras, when asked for what purpose
he was born, replied that he might look upon the heaven and the sun.
This expression is admired by all, and judged worthy of a philosopher.
But I think that he, being unprepared with an answer, uttered this at
random, that he might <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md) not be
silent. But if he had been wise, he ought to have considered and
reflected with himself; for if any one is ignorant of his own condition,
he cannot even he a man. But let us imagine that the saying was not
uttered on the spur of the moment. Let us see how many and what great
errors he committed in three words. First, he erred in placing the whole
duty of man in the eyes alone, referring nothing to the mind, but
everything to the body. But if he had been blind, would he lose the duty
of a man, which cannot happen without the ruin <span
id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) of the soul? What of the other parts
of the body? Will they be destitute, each of its own duty? Why should I
say that more depends upon the ears than upon the eye, since learning
and wisdom can be gained by the ears only, but not by the eyes only?
Were you born for the sake of seeing the heaven and the sun? Who
introduced you to this <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) sight? or
what does your vision contribute to the heaven and the nature of things?
Doubtless that you may praise this immense and wonderful work. Therefore
confess that God is the Creator of all things, who introduced you into
this world, as a witness and praiser of His great work. You believe that
it is a great thing to behold the heaven and the sun: why, therefore, do
you not give thanks to Him who is the author of this benefit? why do you
not measure with your mind the excellence, the providence, and the power
of Him whose works you admire? For it must be, that He who created
objects worthy of admiration, is Himself much more to be admired. If any
one had invited you to dinner, and you had been well entertained, should
you appear in your senses, if you esteemed the mere pleasure more highly
than the author of the pleasure? So entirely do philosophers refer all
things to the body, and nothing at all to the mind, nor do they see
beyond that which fails under their eyes. <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) But all the offices of the body being
put aside, the business of man is to be placed in the mind alone.
Therefore we are not born for this purpose, that we may see those things
which are created, but that we may contemplate, that is, behold with our
mind, the Creator of all things Himself. Wherefore, if any one should
ask a man who is truly wise for what purpose he was born, he will answer
without fear or hesitation, that he was born for the purpose of
worshipping God, who brought us into being for his cause, that we may
serve Him. But to serve God is nothing else than to maintain and
preserve justice by good works. But he, as a man ignorant of divine
things, reduced a matter of the greatest magnitude to the least, by
selecting two things only, which he said were to be beheld by him. But
if he had said that he was born to behold the world, although he would
comprise all things in this, and would use an expression of
greater <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) sound, yet he would not
have completed the duty of man; for as much as the soul excels the body,
so much does God excel the world, for God made and governs the world.
Therefore it is not the world which is to be contemplated by the eye,
for each is a body; <span id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) but it is
God who is to be contemplated by the soul: for God, being Himself
immortal, willed that the soul also should be everlasting. But the
contemplation of God is the reverence and worship of the common Parent
of mankind. And if the philosophers were destitute of this, and in their
ignorance of divine things prostrated themselves to the earth, we must
suppose that <span id="iii.ii.iii.ix-p6.1"></span>Anaxagoras neither
beheld the heaven nor the sun, though he said that he was born that he
might behold them. The object proposed to man is therefore plain <span
id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) and easy, if he is wise; and to it
especially belongs humanity. <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md) For
what is humanity itself, but justice? what is justice, but piety? And
piety <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md) is nothing else than the
recognition of God as a parent.
