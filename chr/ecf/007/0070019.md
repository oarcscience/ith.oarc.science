<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chap. xiii.—how vain and trifling are the interpretations of the stoics respecting the gods, and in them concerning the origin of jupiter, concerning saturn and Ops.

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1"></span>If therefore these speculations of the
philosophers are trifling, what remains, except that we believe it to be
a matter of fact that, being a man, he suffered mutilation from a man?
Unless by chance any one esteems him as a god who feared a co-heir;
whereas, if he had possessed any divine knowledge, he ought not to have
mutilated his father, but himself, to prevent the birth of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.1"></span>Jupiter, who deprived him of the
possession of his kingdom. And he also, when he had married his sister
<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.2"></span>Rhea, whom in Latin we call <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.3"></span>Ops, is said to have been warned by an
oracle not to bring up his male children, because it would come to pass
that he should be driven into banishment by a son. And being in fear of
this, it is plain that he did not devour his sons, as the fables report,
but put them to death; although it is written in sacred history that
<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.4"></span>Saturn and Ops, and other men, were
at that time accustomed to eat human flesh, but that <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.5"></span>Jupiter, who gave to men laws and
civilization, was the first who by an edict prohibited the use of that
food. Now if this is true, what justice can there possibly have been in
him? But let us suppose it to be a fictitious story that Saturn devoured
his sons, only true after a certain fashion; must we then suppose, with
the vulgar, that he has eaten his sons, who has carried them out to
burial? But when Ops had brought forth <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.6"></span>Jupiter, she stole away the infant, and
secretly sent him into Crete to be nourished. Again, I cannot but blame
his want of foresight. For why did he receive an oracle from another,
<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.7"></span>and not from himself<span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.8"></span>? Being placed in heaven, why did he not
see the things which were taking place on earth? Why did the Corybantes
with their cymbals escape his notice? Lastly, why did there exist any
greater force which might overcome his power? Doubtless, being aged, he
was easily overcome by one who was young, and despoiled of his
sovereignty. He was therefore banished and went into exile; and after
long wanderings came into Italy in a ship, as <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.9"></span>Ovid relates in his <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.10"></span>Fasti:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p1.11"></span> “The cause of the ship remains
> to be explained. The scythe-bearing god came to the Tuscan river in a
> ship, having first traversed the world.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p2"></span><span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p2.1"></span>Janus received him wandering and
destitute; and the ancient coins are a proof of this, on which there is
a representation of Janus with a double face, and on the other side a
ship; as the same poet adds:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p2.2"></span> “But pious posterity represented
> a ship on the coin, bearing testimony to the arrival of the stranger
> god.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p3"></span>Not only therefore all the poets, but
the writers also of ancient histories and events, agree that he was a
man, inasmuch as they handed down to memory his actions in Italy: of
Greek writers, <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p3.1"></span>Diodorus and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p3.2"></span>Thallus; of Latin writers, <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p3.3"></span>Nepos, <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p3.4"></span>Cassius, and <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p3.5"></span>Varro. For since men lived in Italy after
a rustic fashion, <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p4.3"></span> “He brought the race to union
> first,  
> Erewhile on mountain tops dispersed,  
> And gave them statutes to obey,  
> And willed the land wherein he lay  
> Should Latium’s title bear.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p5"></span>Does any one imagine him to be a god,
who was driven into banishment, who fled, who lay hid? No one is so
senseless. For he who flees, or lies hid, must fear both violence and
death. <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p5.1"></span>Orpheus, who lived in more
recent times than his, openly relates that <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p5.2"></span>Saturn reigned on earth and among men:—  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p5.3"></span> “First <span
> id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p5.5"></span>Cronus ruled o’er men on earth,  
> And then from Cronus sprung the mighty king,  
> The widely sounding <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p5.8"></span>Zeus.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p6"></span>And also our own <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p6.1"></span>Maro says: <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62)  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p7.2"></span> “This life the golden Saturn led
> on earth;”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p8"></span>and in another place: <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p9.2"></span> “That was the storied age of
> gold,  
> So peacefully, serenely rolled  
> The years beneath his reign.”  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p10"></span>The poet did not say in the former
passage that he led this life in heaven, nor in the latter passage that
he reigned over the gods above. From which it appears that he was a king
on earth; and this he declares more plainly in another place: <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64) —  

> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p11.2"></span> “Restorer of the age of gold,  
> In lands where Saturn ruled of old.”<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>
> <span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-Page_26"></span>  

<span id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p12"></span><span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p12.1"></span>Ennius, indeed, in his <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p12.2"></span>translation of <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p12.3"></span>Euhemerus says that Saturn was not the
first who reigned, but his father <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p12.4"></span>Uranus. In the beginning, he says, <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p12.5"></span>Cœlus first had the supreme power on the
earth. He instituted and prepared that kingdom in conjunction with his
brothers. There is no great dispute, if there is doubt, on the part of
the greatest authorities respecting the son and the father. But it is
possible that each may have happened: that Uranus first began to be
pre-eminent in power among the rest, and to have the chief place, but
not the kingdom; and that afterwards <span
id="iii.ii.i.xiv-p12.6"></span>Saturn acquired greater resources, and
took the title of king.
