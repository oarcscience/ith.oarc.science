#### <span id="iii.v.xlv-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLV.

<span id="iii.v.xlv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.1"></span>Constantine having settled all things at
Rome, went to Milan about the beginning of winter. Thither also <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.2"></span>Licinius came to receive his wife <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.3"></span>Constantia. When <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.4"></span>Daia understood that they were busied in
solemnizing the nuptials, he moved out of Syria in the depth of a severe
winter, and by forced marches he came into Bithynia with an army much
impaired; for he lost all his beasts of burden, of whatever kind, in
consequence of excessive rains and snow, miry ways, cold and fatigue.
Their carcases, scattered about the <span id="page_319">p. 319</span>
<span id="iii.v.xlv-Page_319"></span>roads, seemed an emblem of the
calamities of the impending war, and the presage of a like destruction
that awaited the soldiers. <span id="iii.v.xlv-p1.5"></span>Daia did not
halt in his own territories; but immediately crossed the Thracian
Bosphorus, and in a hostile manner approached the gates of Byzantium.
There was a garrison in the city, established by <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.6"></span>Licinius to check any invasion that <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.7"></span>Daia might make. At first <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.8"></span>Daia attempted to entice the soldiers by the
promise of donatives, and then to intimidate them by assault and storm.
Yet neither promises nor force availed aught. After eleven days had
elapsed, within which time <span id="iii.v.xlv-p1.9"></span>Licinius
might have learned the state of the garrison, the soldiers surrendered,
not through treachery, but because they were too weak to make a longer
resistance. Then <span id="iii.v.xlv-p1.10"></span>Daia moved on to
Heraclea (otherwise called Perinthus), and by delays of the like nature
before that place lost some days. And now <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.11"></span>Licinius by expeditious marches had reached
Adrianople, but with forces not numerous. Then <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.12"></span>Daia, having taken Perinthus by
capitulation, and remained there for a short space, moved forwards
eighteen miles to the first station. Here his progress was stopped; for
<span id="iii.v.xlv-p1.13"></span>Licinius had already occupied the
second station, at the distance also of eighteen miles. <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.14"></span>Licinius, having assembled what forces he
could from the neighbouring quarters, advanced towards <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.15"></span>Daia rather indeed to retard his operations
than with any purpose of fighting, or hope of victory: for <span
id="iii.v.xlv-p1.16"></span>Daia had an army of seventy thousand men,
while he himself had scarce thirty thousand; for his soldiers being
dispersed in various regions, there was not time, on that sudden
emergency, to collect all of them together.
