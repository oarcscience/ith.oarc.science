<span id="iii.ii.vi.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p0.1"></span>Chap. II.—Of the Worship of False Gods and the True God.

<span id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p1"></span>Therefore they sacrifice fine and fat
victims to God, as though He were hungry; they pour forth wine to Him,
as though He were thirsty; they kindle lights to Him, as though He were
in darkness. <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) But if they were
able to conjecture or to conceive in their mind what those heavenly
goods are, the greatness of which we cannot imagine, while we are still
encompassed with an earthly body, they would at once know that they are
most foolish with their empty offices. Or if they would contemplate that
heavenly light which we call the sun, they will at once perceive how God
has no need of their candles, who has Himself given so clear and bright
a light for the use of man. <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md)
And when, in so small a circle, which on account of its distance appears
to have a measure no greater than that of a human head, there is still
so much brilliancy that mortal eye cannot behold it, and if you should
direct your eye to it for a short time mist and darkness would
overspread your dimmed eyes, what light, I pray, what brightness, must
we suppose that there is in God, with whom there is no night? For He has
so attempered this very light, that it might neither injure living
creatures by excessive brightness or vehement heat, and has given it so
much of these properties as mortal bodies might endure or the ripening
of the crops require. Is that man, therefore, to be thought in his
senses, who presents the light of candles and torches as an offering to
Him who is the Author and Giver of light? The light which He requires
from us is of another kind, and that indeed not accompanied with smoke,
but (as the poet says) clear and bright; I mean the light of the mind,
on account of which we are called by the poets <span
class="Foreign"><span id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p3.1"></span>photes</span>, <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) which light no one can exhibit
unless he has known God. But their gods, because they are of the earth,
stand in need of lights, that they may not be in darkness; and their
worshippers, because they have no taste for anything heavenly, are
recalled to the earth even by the religious rites to which they are
devoted. <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) For on the earth
there is need of a light, because its system and nature are dark.
Therefore they do not attribute to the gods a heavenly perception, but
rather a human one. And on this account they believe that the same
things are necessary and pleasing to them as to us, who, when hungry,
have need of food; or, when thirsty, of drink; or, when we are cold,
require a garment; or, when the sun has withdrawn himself, require a
light that we may be able to see. <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p7"></span>From nothing, therefore, can it be so
plainly proved and understood that those gods, since they once lived,
are dead, as from their worship itself, which is altogether of the
earth. For what heavenly influence can there be in the shedding of the
blood of beasts, with which they stain their altars? unless by chance
they imagine that the gods feed upon that which men shrink from
touching. And whoever shall have offered to them this food, <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) although he be an assassin, an
adulterer, a sorcerer, or a parricide, he will he happy and prosperous.
Him they love, him they defend, to him they afford all things which he
shall wish for. <span id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p8.2"></span>Persius therefore
deservedly ridicules superstitions of this kind in his own style: <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) “With what bribe,” he says, “dost
thou win the ears of gods? Is it with lungs and rich intestines?” He
plainly perceived that there is no need of flesh for appeasing the
majesty of heaven, but of a pure mind and a just spirit, and a breast,
as he himself says, which is generous with a natural love of honour.
This is the religion of heaven—not that which consists of corrupt
things, but of the virtues of the soul, which has its origin from
heaven; this is true worship, in which the mind of the worshipper
presents itself as an undefiled offering to God. But how this is to be
obtained, how it is to be afforded, the discussion of this book will
show; for nothing can be so illustrious and so suited to man as to train
men to righteousness. <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md)  

<span id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11"></span>In <span
id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.1"></span>Cicero, <span
id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.2"></span>Catulus in the <span
id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.3"></span>Hortensius, while he prefers philosophy
to all things, says that he would rather have one short treatise
respecting duty, than a long speech in behalf of a seditious man <span
id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.4"></span>Cornelius. And this is plainly to be
regarded not as the opinion of <span
id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.5"></span>Catulus, who perhaps did not utter this
saying, but as that of <span id="iii.ii.vi.ii-p11.6"></span>Cicero, who
wrote it. I believe that he wrote it for the purpose of recommending
these books which he was about to write on Offices, in which very books
he testifies that nothing in the whole <span id="page_164">p. 164</span>
<span id="iii.ii.vi.ii-Page_164"></span>range of philosophy is better
and more profitable than to give precepts for living. But if this is
done by those who do not know the truth, how much more ought we to do
it, who are able to give true precepts, <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) being taught and enlightened by
God? Nor, however, shall we so teach as though we were delivering the
first elements of virtue, which would be an endless task, but as though
we had undertaken the instruction of him who, with them, appears to be
already perfect. For while their precepts remain, which they are
accustomed to give correctly, with a view to uprightness, we will add to
them things which were unknown to them, for the completion and
consummation of righteousness, which they do not possess. But I will
omit those things which are common to us with them, that I may not
appear to borrow from those whose errors I have determined to convict
and bring to light.
