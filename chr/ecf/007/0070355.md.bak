#### <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XLVI.

<span id="iii.v.xlvi-p1"></span>The armies thus approaching each other,
seemed on the eve of a battle. Then <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Daia made this vow to <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p1.2"></span>Jupiter, that if he obtained victory he
would extinguish and utterly efface the name of the Christians. And on
the following night an angel of the Lord seemed to stand before <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p1.3"></span>Licinius while he was asleep, admonishing
him to arise immediately, and with his whole army to put up a prayer to
the Supreme God, and assuring him that by so doing he should obtain
victory. <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p1.4"></span>Licinius fancied that,
hearing this, he arose, and that his monitor, who was nigh him, directed
how be should pray, and in what words. Awaking from sleep, he sent for
one of his secretaries, and dictated these words exactly as he had heard
them:—  

<span id="iii.v.xlvi-p2"></span>“Supreme God, we beseech Thee; Holy God,
we beseech Thee; unto Thee we commend all right; unto Thee we commend
our safety; unto Thee we commend our empire. By Thee we live, by Thee we
are victorious and happy. Supreme Holy God, hear our prayers; to Thee we
stretch forth our arms. Hear, Holy Supreme God.”  

<span id="iii.v.xlvi-p3"></span>Many copies were made of these words,
and distributed amongst the principal commanders, who were to teach them
to the soldiers under their charge. At this all men took fresh courage,
in the confidence that victory bad been announced to them from heaven.
<span id="iii.v.xlvi-p3.1"></span>Licinius resolved to give battle on
the kalends of May; <span id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md) for
precisely eight years before <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p4.1"></span>Daia had
received the dignity of <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p4.2"></span>Cæsar, and
<span id="iii.v.xlvi-p4.3"></span>Licinius chose that day in hopes that
<span id="iii.v.xlvi-p4.4"></span>Daia might be vanquished on the
anniversary of <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p4.5"></span>his reign, as <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p4.6"></span>Maxentius had been on <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p4.7"></span>his. <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p4.8"></span>Daia,
however, purposed to give battle earlier, to fight on the day before
those kalends, <span id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md) and to triumph
on the anniversary of his reign. Accounts came that <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.2"></span>Daia was in motion; the soldiers of <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.3"></span>Licinius armed themselves; and advanced. A
barren and open plain, called <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.4"></span>Campus
Serenus, lay between the two armies. They were now in sight of one
another. The soldiers of <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.5"></span>Licinius
placed their shields on the ground, took off their helmets, and,
following the example of their leaders, stretched forth their hands
towards heaven. Then the emperor uttered the prayer, and they all
repeated it after him. The host, doomed to speedy destruction, heard the
murmur of the prayers of their adversaries. And now, the ceremony having
been thrice performed, the soldiers of <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.6"></span>Licinius became full of courage, buckled on
their helmets again, and resumed their shields. The two emperors
advanced to a conference: but <span id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.7"></span>Daia
could not be brought to peace; for he held <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.8"></span>Licinius in contempt, and imagined that the
soldiers would presently abandon an emperor parsimonious in his
donatives, and enter into the service of one liberal even to profusion.
And indeed it was on this notion that he began the war. He looked for
the voluntary surrender of the armies of <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.9"></span>Licinius; and, thus reinforced, he meant
forthwith to have attacked <span
id="iii.v.xlvi-p5.10"></span>Constantine.
