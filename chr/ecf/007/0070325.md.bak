#### <span id="iii.v.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. XVI.

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p1"></span>Thus was all the earth afflicted; and
from east to west, except in the territories of Gaul, three ravenous
wild beasts continued to rage.  

> <span id="iii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span> “Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred
> tongues,  
> A voice of brass, and adamantine lungs,  
> Not half the dreadful scene could I disclose,”  

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p2"></span>or recount the punishments inflicted by
the rulers in every province on religious and innocent men.  

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p3"></span>But what need of a particular recital of
those things, especially to you, my best beloved <span
id="iii.v.xvi-p3.1"></span>Donatus, <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) who above all others was exposed to
the storm of that violent persecution? For when you had fallen into the
hands of the prefect <span id="iii.v.xvi-p4.3"></span>Flaccinian, no
puny murderer, and afterwards of <span
id="iii.v.xvi-p4.4"></span>Hierocles, who from a deputy became president
of Bithynia, the author and adviser of the persecution, and last of all
into the hands of his successor <span id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span
id="iii.v.xvi-Page_307"></span><span
id="iii.v.xvi-p4.5"></span>Priscillian, you displayed to mankind a
pattern of invincible magnanimity. Having been nine times exposed to
racks and diversified torments, nine times by a glorious profession of
your faith you foiled the adversary; in nine combats you subdued the
devil and his chosen soldiers; and by nine victories you triumphed over
this world and its terrors. How pleasing the spectacle to God, when He
beheld you a conqueror, yoking in your chariot not white horses, nor
enormous elephants, but those very men who had led captive the nations!
After this sort to lord it over the lords of the earth is triumph
indeed! Now, by your valour were they conquered, when you set at
defiance their flagitious edicts, and, through stedfast faith and the
fortitude of your soul, you routed all the vain terrors of tyrannical
authority. Against you neither scourges, nor iron claws, nor fire, nor
sword, nor various kinds of torture, availed aught; and no violence
could bereave you of your fidelity and persevering resolution. This it
is to be a disciple of God, and this it is to be a soldier of Christ; a
soldier whom no enemy can dislodge, or wolf snatch, from the heavenly
camp; no artifice ensnare, or pain of body subdue, or torments
overthrow. At length, after those nine glorious combats, in which the
devil was vanquished by you, he dared not to enter the lists again with
one whom, by repeated trials, he had found unconquerable; and he
abstained from challenging you any more, lest you should have laid hold
on the garland of victory already stretched out to you; an unfading
garland, which, although you have not at present received it, is laid up
in the kingdom of the Lord for your virtue and deserts. But let us now
return to the course of our narrative.
