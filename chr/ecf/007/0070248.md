#### <span id="iii.ii.viii.lvi-p0.1"></span>Chap. LX.—Of the Duties of Justice.

<span id="iii.ii.viii.lvi-p1"></span>When the affairs of men were in
this condition, God pitied us, revealed and displayed Himself to us,
that in Himself we might learn religion, faith, purity, and mercy; that
having laid aside the error of our former life, together with God
Himself we might know ourselves, whom impiety had disunited from Him,
and we might choose <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) the
divine law, which unites human affairs with heavenly, the Lord Himself
delivering it to us; by which law all the errors with which we have been
ensnared, together with vain and impious superstitions, might be taken
away. What we owe to man, therefore, is prescribed by that same divine
law which teaches that whatever you render to man is rendered to God.
But the root of justice, and the entire foundation of equity, is that
you should not do that which you would be unwilling to suffer, but
should measure the feelings of another by your own. If it is an
unpleasant thing to bear an injury, and he who has done it appears
unjust, transfer to the person of another that which you feel respecting
yourself, and to your own person that which you judge respecting
another, and you will understand that you act as unjustly if you injure
another as another would if he should injure you. If we consider these
things, we shall maintain innocence, in which the first step of justice
is, as it were, contained. For the first thing is, not to injure; the
next is, to be of service. And as in uncultivated lands, before you
begin to sow, the fields must be cleansed by tearing up the thorns and
cutting off all the roots of trunks, so vices must first be thrust out
from our souls, and then at length virtues must be implanted, from which
the fruits of immortality, being engendered by the word of God, may
spring up.
