<p> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxi-p0.1"></A>Chap. XXI.&#8212;Of the Torments and Punishments of Souls.</h4>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxi-p1"></A>First of all, therefore, we say that the power of God is so great, that He perceives even incorporeal things, and manages them as He will. <A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxi-Page_217"></A>For even angels fear God, because they can be chastised by Him in some unspeakable manner; and devils dread Him, because they are tormented and punished by Him. What wonder is it, therefore, if souls, though they are immortal, are nevertheless capable of suffering at the hand of God? For since they have nothing solid and tangible in themselves, they can suffer no violence from solid and corporeal beings; but because they live in their spirits only, they are capable of being handled by God alone, whose energy and substance is spiritual. But, however, the sacred writings inform us in what manner the wicked are to undergo punishment. For because they have committed sins in their bodies, they will again be clothed with flesh, that they may make atonement in their bodies; and yet it will not be that flesh with which God clothed man, like this our earthly body, but indestructible, and abiding for ever, that it may be able to hold out against tortures and everlasting fire, the nature of which is different from this fire of ours, which we use for the necessary purposes of life, and which is extinguished unless it be sustained by the fuel of some material. But that divine fire always lives by itself, and flourishes without any nourishment; nor has it any smoke mixed with it, but it is pure and liquid, and fluid, after the manner of water. For it is not urged upwards by any force, as our fire, which the taint of the earthly body, by which it is held, and smoke intermingled, compels to leap forth, and to fly upwards to the nature of heaven, with a tremulous movement.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1412"></A><A HREF="#fn_1412"><FONT SIZE="1">1413</FONT></A>
  &#160;</p>  
<p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.vii.xxi-p3"></A>The same divine fire, therefore, with one and the same force and power, will both burn the wicked and will form them again, and will replace as much as it shall consume of their bodies, and will supply itself with eternal nourishment: which the poets transferred to the vulture of <a name="iii.ii.vii.xxi-p3.1"></A>Tityus. Thus, without any wasting of bodies, which regain their substance, it will only burn and affect them with a sense of pain. But when He shall have judged the righteous, He will also try them with fire. Then they whose sins shall exceed either in weight or in number, shall be scorched by the fire and burnt:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1413"></A><A HREF="#fn_1413"><FONT SIZE="1">1414</FONT></A>
 but they whom full justice and maturity of virtue has imbued will not perceive that fire; for they have something of God in themselves which repels and rejects the violence of the flame. So great is the force of innocence, that the flame shrinks from it without doing harm; which has received from God this power, that it burns the wicked, and is under the command of the righteous. Nor, however, let any one imagine that souls are immediately judged after death. For all are detained in one and a common place of confinement, until the arrival of the time in which the great Judge shall make an investigation of their deserts.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1414"></A><A HREF="#fn_1414"><FONT SIZE="1">1415</FONT></A>
 Then they whose piety shall have been approved of will receive the reward of immortality; but they whose sins and crimes shall have been brought to light will not rise again, but will be hidden in the same darkness with the wicked, being destined to certain punishment. &#160;</p>
