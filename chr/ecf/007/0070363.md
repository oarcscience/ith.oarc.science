### <span id="iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Fragments of Lactantius

<span id="iii.vi-p2"></span>I. <span id="iii.vi-p2.1"></span>Fear, love,
joy, sadness, lust, eager desire, anger, pity, emulation,
admiration,—these motions or affections of the mind exist from the
beginning of man’s creation by the Lord; and they were usefully and
advantageously introduced into human nature, that by governing himself
by these with method, and in accordance with reason, man may be able, by
acting manfully, to exercise those good qualities, by means of which he
would justly have deserved to receive from the Lord eternal life. For
these affections of the mind being restrained within their proper
limits, that is, being rightly employed, produce at present good
qualities, and in the future eternal rewards. But when they
advance <span id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003) beyond their
boundaries, that is, when they turn aside to an evil course, then vices
and iniquities come forth, and produce everlasting punishments. <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004)  

<span id="iii.vi-p5"></span>II. Within our memory, also, <span
id="iii.vi-p5.1"></span>Lactantius speaks of metres,—the pentameter (he
says) and the tetrameter. <span id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005)  

<span id="iii.vi-p7"></span>III. <span
id="iii.vi-p7.1"></span>Firmianus, writing to <span
id="iii.vi-p7.2"></span>Probus on the metres of comedies, thus speaks:
“For as to the question which you proposed concerning the metres of
comedies, I also know that many are of opinion that the plays of <span
id="iii.vi-p7.3"></span>Terence in particular have not the metre of
Greek comedy,—that is, of <span id="iii.vi-p7.4"></span>Menander, <span
id="iii.vi-p7.5"></span>Philemon, and <span
id="iii.vi-p7.6"></span>Diphilus, which consist of trimeter verses; for
our ancient writers of comedies, in the modulation of their plays,
preferred to follow <span id="iii.vi-p7.7"></span>Eupolis, <span
id="iii.vi-p7.8"></span>Cratinus, and <span
id="iii.vi-p7.9"></span>Aristophanes, as has been before said.” That
there is a measure—that is, metre <span
id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006) —in the plays of <span
id="iii.vi-p8.2"></span>Terence and <span
id="iii.vi-p8.3"></span>Plautus, and of the other comic and tragic
writers, let these declare: <span id="iii.vi-p8.4"></span>Cicero, <span
id="iii.vi-p8.5"></span>Scaurus, and <span
id="iii.vi-p8.6"></span>Firmianus. <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007)  

<span id="iii.vi-p10"></span>IV. We will bring forward the sentiments of
our <span id="iii.vi-p10.1"></span>Lactantius, which he expressed in
words in his third volume to <span id="iii.vi-p10.2"></span>Probus on
this subject. The Gauls, he says, were from ancient times called
Galatians, from the whiteness of their body; and thus the <span
id="iii.vi-p10.3"></span>Sibyl terms them. And this is what the poet
intended to signify when he said,—  

> <span id="iii.vi-p10.4"></span> “Gold collars deck their milk-white
> necks,” <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008)  

<span id="iii.vi-p12"></span>when he might have used the word <span
id="iii.vi-p12.1"></span>white. It is plain that from this the province
was called Galatia, in which, on their arrival in it, the Gauls united
themselves with Greeks, from which circumstance that region was called
Gallogræcia, and afterwards Galatia. And it is no wonder if he said this
concerning the Galatians, and related that a people of the West, having
passed over so great a distance in the middle of the earth, settled in a
region of the East. <span id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009)
