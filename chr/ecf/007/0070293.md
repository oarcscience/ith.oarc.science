#### <span id="iii.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chap. VI.—Of the Error of <span id="iii.iv.vi-p0.2"></span>Epicurus, and of the Limbs and Their Use.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p1"></span>I cannot here be prevented from again
showing the folly of <span id="iii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Epicurus. For all
the ravings of <span id="iii.iv.vi-p1.2"></span>Lucretius <span
id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836) belong to him, who, in order that
he might show that animals are not produced by any contrivance of the
divine mind, but, as he is wont to say, by chance, said that in the
beginning of the world innumerable other animals of wonderful form and
magnitude were produced; but that they were unable to be permanent,
because either the power of taking food, or the method of uniting and
generating, had failed them. It is evident that, in order to make a
place for his atoms flying about through the boundless and empty space,
he wished to exclude the divine providence. But when he saw that a
wonderful system of providence is contained in all things which breathe,
what vanity was it (O mischievous one!) to say that there had been
animals of immense size, in which the system of production ceased!  

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p3"></span>Since, therefore, all things which we see
are produced with reference to a plan—for nothing but a plan <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837) can effect this very condition of
being born—it is manifest that nothing could have been born without a
plan. For it was previously foreseen in the formation of everything, how
it should use the service of the limbs for the necessaries of life; and
how the offspring, being produced from the union of bodies, might
preserve all living creatures by their several species. For if a skilful
architect, when he designs to construct some great building, first of
all considers what will be the effect <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838) of the complete building, and
previously ascertains by measurement what situation is suitable for a
light weight, in what place a massive part of the structure will stand,
what will be the intervals between the columns, what or where will be
the descents and outlets of the falling waters and the reservoirs,—he
first, I say, foresees these things, that he may begin together with the
very foundations whatever things are necessary for the work when now
completed,—why should any one suppose that, in the contrivance of
animals, God did not foresee what things were necessary for living,
before giving life itself? For it is manifest that life could not exist,
unless those things by which it exists were previously arranged. <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839)  

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p7"></span>Therefore <span
id="iii.iv.vi-p7.1"></span>Epicurus saw in the bodies of animals the
skill of a divine plan; but that he might carry into effect that which
he had before imprudently assumed, he added another absurdity agreeing
with the former. For he said that the eyes were not produced for seeing,
nor the ears for hearing, nor the feet for walking, since these members
were produced before there was the exercise of seeing, hearing, and
walking; but that all the offices of these members arose from them after
their production. <span id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840) I fear lest
the refutation of such extravagant and ridiculous stories should appear
to be no less foolish; but it pleases me to be foolish, since we are
dealing with a foolish man, lest he should think himself too
clever. <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841) What do you say,
<span id="iii.iv.vi-p9.2"></span>Epicurus? Were not the eyes produced
for seeing? Why, then, do they see? Their use, he says, afterwards
showed itself. Therefore they were produced for the sake of seeing,
since they can do nothing else but see. Likewise, in the case of the
other limbs, use itself shows for what purpose they were produced. For
it is plain that this use could have no existence, unless all the limbs
had been made with such arrangement and foresight, that they might be
able to have their use.  

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p10"></span>For what if you should say, that birds
were not made to fly, nor wild beasts to rage, nor fishes to swim, nor
men to be wise, when it is evident that living creatures are subject to
that natural disposition and office to which each was created? But it is
evident that he who has lost the main point itself of the truth must
always be in error. For if all things are produced not by providence,
but by a fortuitous meeting together of atoms, why does it never happen
by chance, that those first principles meet together in such a way as to
make an animal of such a kind, that it might rather hear with its
nostrils, smell with its eyes, and see <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842) with its ears? For if the first
principles leave no kind of position untried, monstrous productions of
this kind ought daily to have been brought forth, in which the
arrangement of the limbs might be distorted, <span
id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843) and the use far different from that
which prevails. But since all the races of animals, and all the limbs,
observe their own laws and arrangements, and the uses assigned to them,
it is plain that nothing is made by chance, since a perpetual
arrangement of the divine plan is preserved. But we will refute <span
id="iii.iv.vi-p12.2"></span>Epicurus at another time. Now let <span
id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span id="iii.iv.vi-Page_288"></span>us
discuss the subject of providence, as we have begun.
