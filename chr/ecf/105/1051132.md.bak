id="xxi.iii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50.—Obedience Not Discouraged by
Preaching God’s Gifts.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lii-p2"></span>Such doctors, and so great as these,
when they say that there is nothing of which we may boast as if of our
own which God has not given us, and that our very heart and our thoughts
are not in our own power; and when they give the whole to God, and
confess that from Him we receive that we are converted to Him in such
wise as to continue,—that that which is good appears also to us to be
good, and we wish for it,—that we honour God and receive Christ,—that
from undevout people we are made devout and religious,—that we believe
in the Trinity itself, and also confess with our voice what we
believe:—certainly attribute all these things to God’s grace,
acknowledge them as God’s gifts, and testify that they come to us from
Him, and are not from ourselves. But will any one say that they in such
wise confessed that grace of God as to venture to deny His
foreknowledge,which not only learned but unlearned men also confess?
Again, if they had so known that God gives these things that they were
not ignorant that He foreknew that He would give them, and could not
have been ignorant to whom He would give them: beyond a doubt they had
known the predestination which, as preached by the apostles, we
laboriously and diligently maintain against the modern heretics. Nor
would it be with any manner of justice said, nevertheless, to them
because they preach obedience, and fervently exhort, to the extent of
the ability of each one, to its practice, “If you do not wish that the
obedience to which you are stirring us up should grow cold in our heart,
forbear to preach to us that grace of God by which you confess that God
gives what you are exhorting us to do.”
