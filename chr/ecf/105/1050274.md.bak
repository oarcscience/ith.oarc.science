<span id="xii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—Even Evils, Through God’s Mercy,
are of Use.</span>

<span id="xii.xxxi-p2"></span>He asserts that “no evil is the cause of
anything good;” as if punishment, forsooth, were good, although thereby
many have been reformed. There are, then, evils which are of use by the
wondrous mercy of God. Did that man experience some good thing, when he
said, “Thou didst hide Thy face from me, and I was troubled?” <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) Certainly not; and yet this very
trouble was to him in a certain manner a remedy against his pride. For
he had said in his prosperity, “I shall never be moved;” <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) and so was ascribing to himself
what he was receiving from the Lord. “For what had he that he did not
receive?” <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) It had, therefore,
become necessary to show him whence he had received, that he might
receive in humility what he had lost in pride. Accordingly, he says, “In
Thy good pleasure, O Lord, Thou didst add strength to my beauty.” <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) In this abundance of mine I once
used to say, “I shall not be moved;” whereas it all came from Thee, not
from myself. Then at last Thou didst turn away Thy face from me, and I
became troubled.
