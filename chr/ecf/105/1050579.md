id="xvi.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14 \[XIII.\]—Before Christ It Was a
Time for Marrying; Since Christ It Has Been a Time for
Continence.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xiv-p2"></span>Now this propagation of children which
among the ancient saints was a most bounden duty for the purpose of
begetting and preserving a people for God, amongst whom the prophecy of
Christ’s coming must needs have had precedence over everything, now has
no longer the same necessity. For from among all nations the way is open
for an abundant offspring to receive spiritual regeneration, from
whatever quarter they derive their natural birth. So that we may
acknowledge that the scripture which says there is “a time to embrace,
and a time to refrain from embracing,” <span
id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109) is to be distributed in its clauses
to the periods before Christ and since. The former was the time to
embrace, the latter to refrain from embracing.
