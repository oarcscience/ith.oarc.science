<span id="xv.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[X.\]—Pelagius’ Definition of How
God Helps Us: “He Promises Us Future Glory.”</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xi-p2"></span>For in another passage, after asserting
at length that it is not by the help of God, but out of our own selves,
that a good will is formed within us, he confronted himself with a
question out of the apostle’s epistle; and he asked this question: “How
will this stand consistently with the apostle’s words, <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802) ‘It is God that worketh in you both
to will and to perfect’?” Then, in order to obviate this opposing
authority, which he plainly saw to be most thoroughly contrasted with
his own dogma, he went on at once to add: “He works in us to will what
is good, to will what is holy, when He rouses us from our devotion to
earthly desires, and from our love of the present only, after the manner
of brute animals, by the magnitude of the future glory and the promise
of its rewards; when by revealing wisdom to us He stirs up our sluggish
will to a longing after God; when (what you are not afraid to deny in
another passage) he persuades us to everything which is good.” Now what
can be plainer, than that by the grace whereby God works within us to
will what is good, he means nothing else than the law and the teaching?
For in the law and the teaching of the holy Scriptures are promised
future glory and its great rewards. To the teaching also appertains the
revelation of wisdom, whilst it is its further function to direct our
thoughts to everything that is good. And if between teaching and
persuading (or rather exhorting) there seems to be a difference, yet
even this is provided for in the general term “teaching,” which is
contained in the several discourses or letters; for the holy Scriptures
both teach and exhort, and in the processes of teaching and exhorting
there is room likewise for man’s operation. We, however, on our side
would fain have him sometime confess that grace, by which not only
future glory in all its magnitude is promised, but also is believed in
and hoped for; by which wisdom is not only re<span id="page_221">p.
221</span> <span id="xv.iii.xi-Page_221"></span>vealed, but also loved;
by which everything that is good is not only recommended, but pressed
upon us until we accept it. For all men do not possess faith, <span
id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803) who hear the Lord in the Scriptures
promising the kingdom of heaven; nor are all men persuaded, who are
counselled to come to Him, who says, “Come unto me, all ye that
labour.” <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804) They, however, who
have faith are the same who are also persuaded to come to Him. This He
Himself set forth most plainly, when He said, “No man can come to me,
except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him.” <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805) And some verses afterwards, when
speaking of such as believe not, He says, “Therefore said I unto you,
that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my
Father.” <span id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806) This is the grace
which Pelagius ought to acknowledge, if he wishes not only to be called
a Christian, but to be one.
