<span id="xx.l-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47.—Another Interpretation of the
Apostolic Passage, “Who Will Have All Men to Be Saved.”</span>

<span id="xx.l-p2"></span>That, therefore, in our ignorance of who shall
be saved, God commands us to will that all to whom we preach this peace
may be saved, and Himself works this in us by diffusing that love in our
hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us,—may also thus be
understood, that God wills all men to be saved, because He makes us to
will this; just as “He sent the Spirit of His Son, crying, Abba,
Father;” <span id="fr_3403"></span>[3404](#fn_3403) that is, making us
to cry, Abba, Father. Because, concerning that same Spirit, He says in
another place, “We have received the Spirit of adoption, in whom we cry,
Abba, Father!” <span id="fr_3404"></span>[3405](#fn_3404) We therefore
cry, but He is said to cry who makes us to cry. If, then, Scripture
rightly said that the Spirit was crying by whom we are made to cry, it
rightly also says that God wills, when by Him we are made to will. And
thus, because by rebuke we ought to do nothing save to avoid departure
from that peace which is towards God, or to induce return to it of him
who had departed, let us do in hope what we do. If he whom we rebuke is
a son of peace, our peace shall rest upon him; but if not, it shall
return to us again.
