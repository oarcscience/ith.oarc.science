id="xxi.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[II.\]—Even the Beginning of
Faith is of God’s Gift.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.iii-p2"></span>Therefore I ought first to show that the
faith by which we are Christians is the gift of God, if I can do that
more thoroughly than I have already done in so many and so large
volumes. But I see that I must now reply to those who say that the
divine testimonies which I have adduced concerning this matter are of
avail for this purpose, to assure us that we have faith itself of
ourselves, but that its increase is of God; as if faith were not given
to us by Him, but were only increased in us by Him, on the ground of the
merit of its having begun from us. Thus there is here no departure from
that opinion which Pelagius himself was constrained to condemn in the
judgment of the bishops of Palestine, as is testified in the same
Proceedings, “That the grace of God is given according to our
merits,” <span id="fr_3421"></span>[3422](#fn_3421) if it is not of
God’s grace that we begin to believe, but rather that on account of this
beginning an addition is made to us of a more full and perfect belief;
and so we first give the beginning of our faith to God, that His
supplement may also be given to us again, and whatever else we
faithfully ask.
