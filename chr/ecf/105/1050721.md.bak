<span id="xvii.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[IX.\]—Victor Teaches that God
Thwarts His Own Predestination.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.xiii-p2"></span>Let us now go on to plainer matters.
For while he was confined within these great straits, as to how souls
can be held bound by the chain of original sin, when they derive not
their origin from the soul which first sinned, but the Creator breathes
them afresh at every birth into sinful <span id="page_337">p. 337</span>
<span id="xvii.v.xiii-Page_337"></span>flesh,—pure from all contagion
and propagation of sin:—in order that he might avoid the objection being
brought against his argument, that thus God makes them guilty by such
insufflation, he first of all had recourse to the theory drawn from
God’s prescience, that “He had provided redemption for them.” Infants
are by the sacrament of this redemption baptized, so that the original
sin which they contracted from the flesh is washed away, as if God were
remedying His own acts for having made these souls polluted. But
afterwards, when he comes to speak of those who receive no such
assistance, but expire before they are baptized, he says: “In this place
I do not offer myself as an authority, but I present you with an example
by way of conjecture. We say, then, that some such method as this must
be had recourse to in the case of infants, who, being predestinated for
baptism, are yet, by the failing of this life, hurried away before they
are born again in Christ. We read,” adds he, “it written of such,
Speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his
understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. Therefore He hasted to take
him away from among the wicked, for his soul pleased the Lord; and,
being made perfect in a short time, he fulfilled a long time.” <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) Now who would disdain having such a
teacher as this? Is it the case, then, with infants, whom people usually
wish to have baptized, even hurriedly, before they die, that, if they
should be detained ever so short a time in this life, that they might be
baptized, and then at once die, wickedness would alter their
understanding, and deceit beguile their soul; and to prevent this
happening to them, a hasty death came to their rescue, so that they were
suddenly taken away before they were baptized? By their very baptism,
then, they were changed for the worse, and beguiled by deceit, if it was
after baptism that they were snatched away. O excellent teaching, worthy
to be admired and closely followed! But he presumed greatly on the
prudence of all you who were present at his reading, and especially on
yours, to whom he addressed this treatise and handed it after the
reading, in supposing that you would believe that the scripture he
quoted was intended for the case of unbaptized infants, although it was
written of the immature ages of all those saints whom foolish men deem
to be hardly dealt with, whenever they are suddenly removed from the
present life and are not permitted to attain to the years which people
covet for themselves as a great gift of God. What, however, is the
meaning of these words of his: “Infants predestinated for baptism, who
are yet, by the failing of this life, hurried away before they are born
again in Christ,” as if some power of fortune, or fate, or anything else
you please, did not permit God to fulfil what He had fore-ordained? And
how is it that He hurries them Himself away, when they have pleased Him?
Then, does He really predestinate them to be baptized, and then Himself
hinder the accomplishment of the very thing which He has predestinated?
