<span id="xviii.vi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25 \[IX.\]—Cyprian’s Testimonies
Concerning God’s Grace.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxv-p2"></span>But now it plainly appears in what way
Cyprian proclaims the grace of God against such as these, when he is
arguing about the Lord’s Prayer. For he says: “We say, ‘May Thy name be
made holy,’ <span id="fr_2851"></span>[2852](#fn_2851.md) not that we wish
for God that He may be made holy by our prayers, but that we beseech of
Him that His name may be made holy in us. But by whom is God made holy,
since He Himself makes holy? But, because He says, ‘Be ye holy, because
I also am holy,’ we ask and entreat this, that we who were made holy in
baptism may continue in that which we have begun to be.” <span
id="fr_2852"></span>[2853](#fn_2852.md) And in another place in the same
epistle he says: “We add also, and say, ‘Thy will be done in heaven, and
in earth,’ not in order that God may do what He wills, but that we may
be able to do what God wills. For who resists God that He may not do
what He wills? But, since we are hindered by the devil from obeying God
with our thought and deed in all things, we pray and ask that God’s will
may be done in us. And that it may be done in us, we have need of God’s
will, that is, of His help and protection; since no one is strong in his
own strength, but he is safe by the indulgence and mercy of God.” <span
id="fr_2853"></span>[2854](#fn_2853.md) In another place also: “Moreover,
we ask that the will of God may be done both in heaven and in earth,
each of which things pertains to the fulfilment of our safety and
salvation. For since we possess the body from the earth, and the spirit
from heaven, we are ourselves earth and heaven; and <span
id="page_428">p. 428</span> <span id="xviii.vi.xxv-Page_428"></span>in
both, that is, both in body and in spirit, we pray that God’s will be
done. For between the flesh and the spirit there is a struggle, and
there is a daily strife as they disagree one with the other; so that we
cannot do the very things that we would, in that the spirit seeks
heavenly and divine things, while the flesh lusts after earthly and
temporal things. And, therefore, we ask that, by the help and assistance
of God, agreement may be made between these two natures; so that while
the will of God is done both in the spirit and in the flesh, the soul
which is newborn by Him may be preserved. And this the Apostle Paul
openly and manifestly declares by his words. ‘The flesh,’ says he,
‘lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these
are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that
ye would.’” <span id="fr_2854"></span>[2855](#fn_2854.md) And a little
after he says: “And it may be thus understood, most beloved brethren,
that since the Lord commands and teaches us even to love our enemies,
and to pray even for those who persecute us, we should ask even for
those who are still earth, and have not yet begun to be heavenly, that
even in respect of these God’s will may be done, which Christ
accomplished in preserving and renewing humanity.” <span
id="fr_2855"></span>[2856](#fn_2855.md) And again, in another place he
says: “But we ask that this bread should be given to us daily, that we
who are in Christ, and daily receive the Eucharist for the food of
salvation, may not, by the interposition of some more heinous sin,—by
being prevented, as those abstaining and not communicating, from
partaking of the heavenly bread,—be separated from Christ’s body.” <span
id="fr_2856"></span>[2857](#fn_2856.md) And a little afterwards, in the
same treatise he says: “But when we ask that we may not come into
temptation, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness, while we so
ask as that no one should insolently vaunt himself; that none should
proudly and arrogantly assume anything to himself; that none should take
to himself the glory either of confession or of suffering as his own,
when the Lord Himself teaching humility said, ‘Watch and pray, that ye
come not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak;’ <span id="fr_2857"></span>[2858](#fn_2857.md) so that while a humble
and submissive confession comes first, and all is attributed to God,
whatever is sought for suppliantly, with fear and honour of God, may be
granted by His own loving-kindness.” <span
id="fr_2858"></span>[2859](#fn_2858.md) Moreover, in his treatise addressed
to Quirinus, in respect to which work Pelagius wishes himself to appear
as his imitator, he says in the Third Book “that we must boast in
nothing, since nothing is our own.” <span
id="fr_2859"></span>[2860](#fn_2859.md) And subjoining the divine
testimonies to this proposition, he added among others that apostolic
word with which especially the mouths of such as these must be closed:
“For what hast thou, which thou hast not received? But if thou hast
received it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received it?” Also
in the epistle concerning Patience he says: “For we have this virtue in
common with God. From Him patience begins; from Him its glory and its
dignity take their rise. The origin and greatness of patience proceed
from God as its Author.” <span id="fr_2860"></span>[2861](#fn_2860.md)
