<span id="xx.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XIII.\]—The Number of the
Predestinated is Certain and Defined.</span>

<span id="xx.xlii-p2"></span>I speak thus of those who are predestinated
to the kingdom of God, whose number is so certain that one can neither
be added to them nor taken from them; not of those who, when He had
<span id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="xx.xlii-Page_488"></span>announced and spoken, were multiplied
beyond number. For they may be said to be called but not chosen, because
they are not called according to the purpose. But that the number of the
elect is certain, and neither to be increased nor diminished,—although
it is signified by John the Baptist when he says, “Bring forth,
therefore, fruits meet for repentance: and think not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for God is able of these
stones to raise up children to Abraham,” <span
id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375) to show that they were in such wise
to be cut off if they did not produce fruit, that the number which was
promised to Abraham would not be wanting,—is yet more plainly declared
in the Apocalypse: “Hold fast that which thou hast, lest another take
thy crown.” <span id="fr_3376"></span>[3377](#fn_3376) For if *another*
would not receive unless *one* should have lost, the number is fixed.
