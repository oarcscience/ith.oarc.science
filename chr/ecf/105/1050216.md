<span id="xi.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—How that is to Be the Reward of
All; The Apostle Earnestly Defends Grace.</span>

<span id="xi.xliii-p2"></span>What then is the import of the “*All*,
from the least unto the greatest of them,” but all that belong
spiritually to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah,—that is,
to the children of Isaac, to the seed of Abraham? For such is the
promise, wherein it was said to him, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called;
for they which are the children of the flesh are not the children of
God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. For this
is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a
son. And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even
by our father Isaac, (for the children being not yet born, neither
having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to
election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth,) it was
said unto her, “The elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887) This is the house of Israel, or rather
the house of Judah, on account of Christ, who came of the tribe of
Judah. This is the house of the children of promise,—not by reason of
their own merits, but of the kindness of God. For God promises what He
Himself performs: He does not Himself promise, and another perform;
which would no longer be promising, but prophesying. Hence it is “not of
works, but of Him that calleth,” <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888)
lest the result should be their own, not God’s; lest the reward should
be ascribed not to His grace, but to their due; and so grace should be
no longer grace which was so earnestly defended and maintained by him
who, though the least of the apostles, laboured more abundantly than all
the rest,—yet not himself, but the grace of God that was with him. <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889) “They shall all know me,” <span
id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890) He says,—“*All*,” the house of Israel
and house of Judah. “*All*,” however, “are not Israel which are of
Israel,” <span id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891) but they only to whom
it is said in “the psalm concerning the morning aid” <span
id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892) (that is, concerning the new
refreshing light, meaning that of the new testament), “All ye the seed
of Jacob, glorify Him; and fear Him, all ye the seed of Israel.” <span
id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893) All the seed, without exception, even
the entire seed of the promise and of the called, but only of those who
are the called according to His purpose. <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894) “For whom He did predestinate, them He
also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He
justified, them He also glorified.” <span
id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895) “Therefore it is of faith, that it
might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed:
not to that only which is of the law,”—that is, which comes from the Old
Testament into the New,—“but to that also which is of faith,” which was
indeed prior to the law, even “the faith of Abraham,”—meaning those who
imitate the faith of Abraham,—“who is the father of us all; as it is
written, I have made <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span
id="xi.xliii-Page_100"></span>thee the father of many nations.”  <span
id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896) Now all these predestinated, called,
justified, glorified ones, shall know God by the grace of the new
testament, from the least to the greatest of them.
