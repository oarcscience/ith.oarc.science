<span id="xvi.vi.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46.—The Reign of Death, What It
Is; The Figure of the Future Adam; How All Men are Justified Through
Christ.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xlvii-p2"></span>But what else is meant even by the
apostle’s subsequent words? For after he had said the above, he added,
“For until the law sin was in the world,” <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288) as much as to say that not even the
law was able to take away sin. “But sin,” adds he, “was not imputed when
there was no law.” <span id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289) It existed
then, but was not imputed, for it was not set forth so that it might be
imputed. It is on the same principle, indeed, that he says in another
passage: “By the law is the knowledge of sin.” <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290) “Nevertheless,” says he, “death
reigned from Adam to Moses;” <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291)
that is, as he had already expressed it, “until the law.” Not that there
was no sin after Moses, but because even the law, which was given by
Moses, was unable to deprive death of its power, which, of course,
reigns only by sin. Its reign, too, is such as to plunge mortal man even
into that second death which is to endure for evermore. “Death reigned,”
but over whom? “Even over them that had not sinned after the similitude
of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of Him that was to
come.” <span id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292) Of whom that was to
come, if not Christ? And in what sort a figure, except in the way of
contrariety? which he elsewhere briefly expresses: “As in Adam all die,
even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293) The one condition was in one, even
as the other condition was in the other; this is the figure. But this
figure is not conformable in every respect; accordingly the apostle,
following up the same idea, added, “But not as the offence, so also is
the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead; much more
the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus
Christ, hath abounded unto many.” <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294) But why “hath it much more
abounded,” except it be that all who are delivered through Christ suffer
temporal death on Adam’s account, but have everlasting life in store for
the sake of Christ Himself? “And not as it was by one that sinned,” says
he, “so is the gift: for the judgment was from one to condemnation, but
the free gift is from many offences unto justification.” <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295) “By one” what, but offence? since
it is added, “the free gift is from many offences.” Let these objectors
tell us how it can be “by one offence unto condemnation,” unless it be
that even the one original sin which has passed over unto all men is
sufficient for condemnation? Whereas the free gift delivers from many
offences to justification, because it not only cancels the one offence,
which is derived from the primal sin, but all others also which are
added in every individual man by the motion of his own will. “For if by
one man’s offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive
abundance of grace and righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus
Christ. Therefore, by the offence of <span id="page_302">p. 302</span>
<span id="xvi.vi.xlvii-Page_302"></span>one upon all men to
condemnation; so by the righteousness of one upon all men unto
justification of life.” <span id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296) Let
them after this persist in their vain imaginations, and maintain that
one man did not hand on sin by propagation, but only set the example of
committing it. How is it, then, that by one’s offence judgment comes on
all men to condemnation, and not rather by each man’s own numerous sins,
unless it be that even if there were but that one sin, it is sufficient,
without the addition of any more, to lead to condemnation,—as, indeed,
it does lead all who die in infancy who are born of Adam, without being
born again in Christ? Why, then, does he, when he refuses to hear the
apostle, ask us for an answer to his question, “By what means may sin be
discovered in an infant,—through the will, or through marriage, or
through its parents?” Let him listen in silence, and hear by what means
sin may be discovered in an infant. “By the offence of one,” says the
apostle, “upon all men to condemnation.” He said, moreover, all to
condemnation through Adam, and all to justification through Christ: not,
of course, that Christ removes to life all those who die in Adam; but he
said “all” and “all,” because, as without Adam no one goes to death, so
without Christ no man to life. Just as we say of a teacher of letters,
when he is alone in a town: This man teaches all their learning; not
because all the inhabitants take lessons, but because no man who learns
at all is taught by any but him. Indeed, the apostle afterwards
designates as *many* those whom he had previously described as *all*,
meaning the self-same persons by the two different terms. “For,” says
he, “as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
obedience of one shall many be made righteous.” <span
