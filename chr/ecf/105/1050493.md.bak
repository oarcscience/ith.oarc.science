<span id="xv.iii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38 \[XXXV.\]—A Definition of the
Grace of Christ by Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxxviii-p2"></span>“Let them read,” says he, “the
epistle which we wrote about twelve years ago to that holy man Bishop
Paulinus: its subject throughout in some three hundred lines is the
confession of <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span
id="xv.iii.xxxviii-Page_230"></span>God’s grace and assistance alone,
and our own inability to do any good thing at all without God.” Well, I
have read this epistle also, and found him dwelling throughout it on
scarcely any other topic than the faculty and capacity of nature, whilst
he makes God’s grace consist almost entirely in this. Christ’s grace,
indeed, he treats with great brevity, simply mentioning its name, so
that his only aim seems to have been to avoid the scandal of ignoring it
altogether. It is, however, absolutely uncertain whether he means
Christ’s grace to consist in the remission of sins, or even in the
teaching of Christ, including also the example of His life (a meaning
which he asserts in several passages of his treatises); or whether he
believes it to be a help towards good living, in addition to nature and
teaching, through the inspiring influence of a burning and shining love.
