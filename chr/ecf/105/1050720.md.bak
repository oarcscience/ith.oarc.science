<span id="xvii.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[VIII.\]—How Did the Soul
Deserve to Be Incarnated?</span>

<span id="xvii.v.xii-p2"></span>He also says some time afterwards: “The
soul therefore, if it deserved to be sinful, although it could not have
been sinful, yet did not remain in sin; because, as it was prefigured in
Christ, it was bound not to be in a sinful state, even as it was unable
to be.” <span id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) Now, my brother, do
you, I ask, really think thus? At any rate, have you formed such an
opinion, after having read and duly considered his words, and after
having reflected upon what extorted from you praise during his reading,
and the expression of your gratitude after he had ended? I pray you,
tell me what this means: “Although the soul deserved to be sinful, which
could not have been sinful.” What mean his phrases, *deserved* and
*could not?* For it could not possibly have deserved its alleged fate,
unless it had been sinful; nor would it have been, unless it could have
been, sinful,—so as, by committing sin previous to any evil desert, it
might make for itself a position whence it might, under God’s desertion,
advance to the commission of other sins. When he said, “which could not
have been sinful,” did he mean, which would not have been able to be
sinful, unless it came in the flesh? But how did it deserve a mission at
all into a state where it could be sinful, when it could not possibly
have become capable of sinning anywhere else, unless it entered that
particular state? Let him, then, tell us how it so deserved. For if it
deserved to become capable of sinning, it must certainly have already
committed some sin, in consequence of which it deserved to be sinful
again. These points, however, may perhaps appear to be obscure, or may
be tauntingly said to be of such a character, but they are really most
plain and clear. The truth is, he ought not to have said that “the soul
deserved to become sinful through the flesh,” when he will never be able
to discover any desert of the soul, either good or bad, previous to its
being in the flesh.
