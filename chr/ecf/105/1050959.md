id="xix.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25 \[XIII.\]—As The Law is Not, So
Neither is Our Nature Itself that Grace by Which We are
Christians.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxv-p2"></span>Now who can be so insensible to the
words of the apostle, who so foolishly, nay, so insanely ignorant of the
purport of his statement, as to venture to affirm that the law is grace,
when he who knew very well what he was saying emphatically declares, “Ye
who are justified by the law are fallen from grace”? Well, but if the
law is not grace, seeing that in order that the law itself may be kept,
it is not the law, but only grace which can give help, will not nature
at any rate be grace? For this, too, the Pelagians have been bold enough
to aver, that grace is the nature in which we were created, so as to
possess a rational mind, by which we are enabled to understand,—formed
as we are in the image of God, so as to have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
creepeth upon the earth. This, however, is not the grace which the
apostle commends to us through the faith of Jesus Christ. For it is
certain that we possess this nature in common with ungodly men and
unbelievers; whereas the grace which comes through the faith of Jesus
Christ belongs only to them to whom the faith itself appertains. “For
all men have not faith.” <span id="fr_3088"></span>[3089](#fn_3088.md) Now,
as the apostle, with perfect truth, says to those who by wishing to be
justified by the law have fallen from grace, “If righteousness come by
the law, then Christ is dead in vain;” <span
id="fr_3089"></span>[3090](#fn_3089.md) so likewise, to those who think
that the grace which he commends and faith in Christ receives, is
nature, the same language is with the same degree of truth applicable:
if righteousness come from nature, then Christ is dead in vain. But the
law was in existence up to that time, and it did not justify; and nature
existed too, but it did not justify. It was not, then, in vain that
Christ died, in order that the law might be fulfilled through Him who
said, “I am come not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it;” <span
id="fr_3090"></span>[3091](#fn_3090.md) and that our nature, which was lost
through Adam, might through Him be recovered, who said that “He was come
to seek and to save that which was lost;” <span
id="fr_3091"></span>[3092](#fn_3091.md) in whose coming the old fathers
likewise who loved God believed.
