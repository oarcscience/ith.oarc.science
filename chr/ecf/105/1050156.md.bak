<span id="x.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[IV.\]—Proof of Original Sin in
Infants.</span>

<span id="x.v.vii-p2"></span>Now, although I may not be able myself to
refute the arguments of these men, I yet see how necessary it is to
adhere closely to the clearest statements of the Scriptures, in order
that the obscure passages may be explained by help of these, or, if the
mind be as yet unequal to either perceiving them when explained, or
investigating them whilst abstruse, let them be believed without
misgiving. But what can be plainer than the many weighty testimonies of
the divine declarations, which afford to us the clearest proof possible
that without union with Christ there is no man who can attain to eternal
life and salvation; and that no man can unjustly be damned,—that is,
separated from that life and salvation,—by the judgment of God? The
inevitable conclusion from these truths is this, that, as nothing else
is effected when infants are baptized except that they are incorporated
into the church, in other words, that they are united with the body and
members of Christ, unless this benefit has been bestowed upon them, they
are manifestly in danger of <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md)
damnation. Damned, however, they could not be if they really had no sin.
Now, since their tender age could not possibly have contracted sin in
its own life, it remains for us, even if we are as yet unable to
understand, at least to believe that infants inherit original sin.
