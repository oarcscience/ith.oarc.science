<span id="xi.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XXII.\]—The Eternal Reward.</span>

<span id="xi.xl-p2"></span>He then went on to state the reward: “I will
be their God, and they shall be my people.” <span
id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871) This corresponds to the Psalmist’s
words to God: “It is good for me to hold me fast by God.” <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872) “I will be,” says God, “their God, and
they shall be my people.” What is better than this good, what happier
than this happiness,—to live to God, to live from God, with whom is the
fountain of life, and in whose light we shall see light? <span
id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873) Of this life the Lord Himself speaks
in these words: “This is life eternal that they may know Thee the only
true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent,” <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874) —that is, “Thee and Jesus Christ whom
Thou hast sent,” the one true God. For no less than this did Himself
promise to those who love Him: “He that loveth me, keepeth my
commandments; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I
will love him, and will manifest myself unto him” <span
id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875) —in the form, no doubt, of God,
wherein He is equal to the Father; not in the form of a servant, for in
this He will display Himself even to the wicked also. Then, however,
shall that come to pass which is written, “Let the ungodly man be taken
away, that he see not the glory of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876) Then also shall “the wicked go into
everlasting punishment, and the righteous into life eternal.” <span
id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877) Now this eternal life, as I have just
mentioned, has been defined to be, that they may know the one true
God. <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878) Accordingly John again
says: “Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be
like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.” <span
id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879) This likeness begins even now to be
reformed in us, while the inward man is being renewed from day to day,
according to the image of Him that created him. <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880)
