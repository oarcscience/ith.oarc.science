<span id="xi.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 55 \[XXXII.\]—What Faith is
Laudable.</span>

<span id="xi.lviii-p2"></span>Since faith, then, is in our power,
inasmuch as every one believes when he likes, and, when he believes,
believes voluntarily; our next inquiry, which we must conduct with care,
is, What faith it is which the apostle commends with so much
earnestness? For indiscriminate faith is not good. Accordingly we find
this caution: “Brethren, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
whether they are of God.” <span id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015.md) Nor
must the clause in commendation of love, that it “believeth all
things,” <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md) be so understood as
if we should detract from the love of any one, if he refuses to believe
at once what he hears. For the same love admonishes us that we ought not
readily to believe anything evil about a brother; and when anything of
the kind is said of him, does it not judge it to be more suitable to its
character not to believe? Lastly, the same love, “which believeth all
things,” does not believe every spirit. Accordingly, charity *believes*
all things no doubt, but it *believes in* God. Observe, it is not said,
Believes *in* all things. It cannot therefore be doubted that the faith
which is commended by the apostle is the faith whereby we believe in
God. <span id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md)
