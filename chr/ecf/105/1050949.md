<span id="xix.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—The Pelagians Profess that the
Only Grace Which is Not Given According to Our Merits is that of the
Forgiveness of Sins.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xv-p2"></span>When, however, the Pelagians say that the
only grace which is not given according to our merits is that whereby
his sins are forgiven to man, but that that which is given in the end,
that is, eternal life, is rendered to our preceding merits: they must
not be allowed to go without an answer. If, indeed, they so understand
our merits as to acknowledge them, too, to be the gifts of God, then
their opinion would not deserve reprobation. But inasmuch as they so
preach human merits as to declare that a man has them of his own self,
then most rightly the apostle replies: “Who maketh thee to differ from
another? And what hast thou, that thou didst not receive? Now, if thou
didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received
it?” <span id="fr_3034"></span>[3035](#fn_3034.md) To a man who holds such
views, it is perfect truth to say: It is His own gifts that God crowns,
not your merits,—if, at least, your merits are of your own self, not of
Him. If, indeed, they are such, they are evil; and God does not crown
them; but if they are good, they are God’s gifts, because, as the
Apostle James says, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.” <span
id="fr_3035"></span>[3036](#fn_3035.md) In accordance with which John also,
the Lord’s forerunner, declares: “A man can receive nothing except it be
given him from heaven” <span id="fr_3036"></span>[3037](#fn_3036.md) —from
heaven, of course, because from thence came also the Holy Ghost, when
Jesus ascended up on high, led captivity captive, and gave gifts to
men. <span id="fr_3037"></span>[3038](#fn_3037.md) If, then, your good
merits are God’s gifts, God does not crown your merits as your merits,
but as His own gifts.
