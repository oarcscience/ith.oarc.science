<span id="xiv.xlii-p2"></span>Bishop John narrated all this in the
hearing of Pelagius; but he, of course, might respectfully say: “Your
holiness is in error; you do not accurately remember the facts. It was
not in reference to the passages of Scripture which you have quoted that
I uttered the words: ‘This is what I also believe.’ Because this is not
my opinion of them. I do not understand them to say, that God’s grace so
co-operates with man, that his abstinence from sin is due, not to ‘him
that willeth, nor to him that runneth, but to God that showeth
mercy.’” <span id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731)
