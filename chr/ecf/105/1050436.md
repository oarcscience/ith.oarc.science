<span id="xiv.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51 \[XXVI.\]—The Nature of Augustin’s
Letter to Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xiv.lv-p2"></span>For my own part, indeed, in my letter which
he produced, I not only abstained from all praises of him, but I even
exhorted him, with as much earnestness as I could, short of actually
mooting the question, to cultivate right views about the grace of God.
In my salutation I called him “*lord*” <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md) —a title which, in our epistolary
style, we usually apply even to some persons who are not Christians,—and
this without untruth, inasmuch as we do, in a certain sense, owe to all
such persons a *service*, which is yet freedom, to help them in
obtaining the salvation which is in Christ. I added the epithet “*most
beloved*;” and as I now call him by this term, so shall I continue to do
so, even if he be angry with me; because, if I ceased to retain my love
towards him, because of his feeling the anger, I should only injure
myself rather than him. I, moreover, styled him “*most longed for*,”
because I greatly longed to have a conversation with him in person; for
I had already heard that he was endeavouring publicly to oppose grace,
whereby we are justified, whenever any mention was made of it. The brief
contents of the letter itself indeed show all this; for, after thanking
him for the pleasure he gave me by the information of his own health and
that of his friends (whose bodily health we are bound of course to wish
for, however much we may desire their amendment in other respects), I at
once expressed the hope that the Lord would recompense him with such
blessings as do not appertain to physical welfare, but which he used to
think, and probably still thinks, consist solely in the freedom of the
will and his own power,—at the same time, and for this reason, wishing
him “eternal life.” Then again, remembering the many good and kind
wishes he had expressed for me in his letter, which I was answering, I
went on to beg of him, too, that he would pray for me, that the Lord
would indeed make me such a man as he believed me to be already; that so
I might gently remind him, against the opinion he was himself
entertaining, that the very righteousness which he had thought worthy to
be praised in me was “not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that showeth mercy.” <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md) This is the substance of that short
letter of mine, and such was my purpose when I dictated it. This is a
copy of it:

<span id="xiv.lv-p3"></span> This term corresponds somewhat to our
*Sir*; but Augustin here refers to its more expressive meaning of
*Master*, or *Lord*.
