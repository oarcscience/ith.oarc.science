<span id="xii.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40 \[XXXV.\]—Why There is a Record in
Scripture of Certain Men’s Sins, Recklessness in Sin Accounts It to Be
So Much Loss Whenever It Falls Short in Gratifying Lust.</span>

<span id="xii.xliv-p2"></span>He who has a sound judgment says soundly,
“that the examples of certain persons, of whose sinning we read in
Scripture, are not recorded for this purpose, that they may encourage
despair of not sinning, and seem somehow to afford security in
committing sin,”—but that we may learn the humility of repentance, or
else discover that even in such falls salvation ought not to be
despaired of. For there are some who, when they have fallen into sin,
perish rather from the recklessness of despair, and not only neglect the
remedy of repentance, but become the slaves of lusts and wicked desires,
so far as to run all lengths in gratifying these depraved and abandoned
dispositions,—as if it were a loss to them if they failed to accomplish
what their lust impelled them to, whereas all the while there awaits
them a certain condemnation. To oppose this morbid recklessness, which
is only too full of danger and ruin, there is great force in the record
of those sins into which even just and holy men have before now fallen.
