<span id="x.iv.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49 \[XXX.\]—An Objection of the
Pelagians.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xlix-p2"></span>They therefore who say, “If through the
sin of the first man it was brought about that we must die, by the
coming of Christ it should be brought about that, believing in Him, we
shall not die;” and they add what they deem a reason, saying, “For the
sin of the first transgressor could not possibly have injured us more
than the incarnation or redemption of the Saviour has benefited us.” But
why do they not rather give an attentive ear, and an unhesitating
belief, to that which the apostle has stated so unambiguously: “Since by
man came death, by Man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in
Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive?” <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621) For it is of nothing else than of the
resurrection of the body that he was speaking. Having said that the
bodily death of all men has come about through one man, he adds the
promise that the bodily resurrection of all men to eternal life shall
happen through one, even Christ. How can it therefore be that “the one
has injured us more by sinning than the other has benefited us by
redeeming,” when by the sin of the former we die a temporal death, but
by the redemption of the latter we rise again not to a temporal, but to
a perpetual life? Our body, therefore, is dead because of sin, but
Christ’s body only died without sin, in order that, having poured out
His blood without fault, “the bonds” <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622) which contain the register of all
faults “might be blotted out,” by which they who now believe in Him were
formerly held as debtors by the devil. And accordingly He says, “This is
my blood, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.” <span
