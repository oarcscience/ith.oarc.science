<span id="x.iii.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 55 \[XXVIII.\]—He Concludes that All
Men Need the Death of Christ, that They May Be Saved. Unbaptized Infants
Will Be Involved in the Condemnation of the Devil. How All Men Through
Adam are Unto Condemnation; And Through Christ Unto Justification. No
One is Reconciled with God, Except Through Christ.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lv-p2"></span>In such circumstances, no man of those who
have come to Christ by baptism has ever been regarded, according to
sound faith and the true doctrine, as excepted from the grace of
forgiveness of sins; nor has eternal life been ever thought possible to
any man apart from His kingdom. For this \[eternal life\] is ready to be
revealed at the last time, <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401) that
is, at the resurrection of the dead who are reserved not for that
eternal death which is called “the second death,” but for the eternal
life which God, who cannot lie, promises to His saints and faithful
servants. Now none who shall partake of this life shall be made alive
except in Christ, even as all die in Adam. <span
id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402) For as none whatever, of all those who
belong to the generation according to the will of the flesh, die except
in Adam, in whom all sinned; so, out of these, none at all who are
regenerated by the will of the Spirit are endowed with life except in
Christ, in whom all are justified. Because as through one all to
condemnation, so through One all to justification. <span
id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403) Nor is there any middle place for any
man, and so a man can only be with the devil who is not with Christ.
Accordingly, also the Lord Himself (wishing to remove from the hearts of
wrong-believers <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404) that vague and
indefinite middle condition, which some would provide for unbaptized
infants,—as if, by reason of their innocence, they were embraced in
eternal life, but were not, because of their unbaptized state, with
Christ in His kingdom) uttered that definitive sentence of His, which
shuts their mouths: “He that is not with me is against me.” <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405) Take then the case of any infant you
please: If he is already in Christ, why is he baptized? If, however, as
the Truth has it, he is baptized just that he may be with Christ, it
certainly follows that he who is not baptized is not with Christ; and
because he is not “with” Christ, he is “against” Christ; for He has
pronounced His own sentence, which is so explicit that we ought not, and
indeed cannot, impair it or change it. And how can he be “against”
Christ, if not owing to sin? for it cannot possibly be from his soul or
his body, both of these being the creation of God. Now if it be owing to
sin, what sin can be found at such an age, except the ancient and
original sin? Of course that sinful flesh in which all are born to
condemnation is one thing, and that Flesh which was made “after the
likeness of sinful flesh,” whereby also all are freed from condemnation,
is another thing. It is, however, by no means meant to be implied that
all who are born in sinful flesh are themselves actually cleansed by
that Flesh which is “like” sinful flesh; “for all men have not
faith;” <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406) but that all who are
born from the carnal union are born entirely of sinful flesh, whilst all
who are born from the spiritual union are cleansed only by the Flesh
which is in the likeness of sinful flesh. <span id="page_37">p.
37</span> <span id="x.iii.lv-Page_37"></span>In other words, the former
class are in Adam unto condemnation, the latter are in Christ unto
justification. This is as if we should say, for example, that in such a
city there is a certain midwife who delivers all; and in the same place
there is an expert teacher who instructs all. By all, in the one case,
only those who are born can possibly be understood; by all, in the
other, only those who are taught: and it does not follow that all who
are born also receive the instruction. But it is obvious to every one,
that in the one case it is correctly said, “she delivers all,” since
without her aid no one is born; and in the other, it is rightly said,
“he teaches all,” since without his tutoring, no one learns.
