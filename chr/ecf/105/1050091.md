id="x.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—Some Persons Attribute Too
Much to the Freedom of Man’s Will; Ignorance and Infirmity.</span>

<span id="x.iv.ii-p2"></span>A solution is extremely necessary of this
question about a human life unassailed by any deception or preoccupation
of sin, in consequence even of our daily prayers. For there are some
persons who presume so much upon the free determination of the human
will, as to suppose that it need not sin, and that we require no divine
assistance,—attributing to our nature, once for all, this determination
of free will. An inevitable consequence of this is, that we ought not to
pray “not to enter into temptation,”—that is, not to be overcome of
temptation, either when it deceives and surprises us in our *ignorance*,
or when it presses and importunes us in our *weakness*. Now how hurtful,
and how pernicious and contrary to our salvation in Christ, and how
violently adverse to the religion itself in which we are instructed, and
to the piety whereby we worship God, it cannot but be for us not to
beseech the Lord for the attainment of such a benefit, but be rather led
to think that petition of the Lord’s Prayer, “Lead us not into
temptation,” <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) a vain and useless
insertion,—it is beyond my ability to express in words.
