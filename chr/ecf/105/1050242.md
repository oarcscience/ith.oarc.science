<span id="xi.lxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 66.—Although Perfect Righteousness Be
Not Found Here on Earth, It is Still Not Impossible.</span>

<span id="xi.lxix-p2"></span>But let objectors find, if they can, any
man, while living under the weight of this corruption, in whom God has
no longer anything to forgive; unless nevertheless they acknowledge that
such an individual has been aided in the attainment of his good
character not merely by the teaching of the law which God gave, but also
by the infusion of the Spirit of grace—they will incur the charge of
ungodliness itself, not of this or that particular sin. Of course they
are not at all able to discover such a man, if they receive in a
becoming manner the testimony of the divine writings. Still, for all
that, it must not by any means be said that the possibility is lacking
to God whereby the will of man can be so assisted, that there can be
accomplished in every respect even now in a man, not that righteousness
only which is of faith, <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) but
that also in accordance with which we shall by and by have to live for
ever in the very vision of God. For if he should now <span
id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span id="xi.lxix-Page_114"></span>wish even
that this corruptible in any particular man should put on
incorruption, <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) and to command
him so to live among mortal men (not destined himself to die) that his
old nature should be wholly and entirely withdrawn, and there should be
no law in his members warring against the law of his mind, <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) —moreover, that he should discover
God to be everywhere present, as the saints shall hereafter know and
behold Him,—who will madly venture to affirm that this is impossible?
Men, however, ask why He does not do this; but they who raise the
question consider not duly the fact that they are human. I am quite
certain that, as nothing is impossible with God <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) so also there is no iniquity with
Him. <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) Equally sure am I that
He resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble. <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) I know also that to him who had a
thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should
be exalted above measure, it was said, when he besought God for its
removal once, twice, nay thrice: “My grace is sufficient for thee; for
my strength is made perfect in weakness.” <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) There is, therefore, in the hidden
depths of God’s judgments, a certain reason why every mouth even of the
righteous should be shut in its own praise, and only opened for the
praise of God. But what this certain reason is, who can search, who
investigate, who know? So “unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways
past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath
been his counsellor? or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be
recompensed unto him again? For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are
all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.” <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md)
