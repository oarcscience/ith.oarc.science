<span id="xiii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—(38.) The Seventh Passage. Who
May Be Called Immaculate. How It is that in God’s Sight No Man is
Justified.</span>

<span id="xiii.xlii-p2"></span>“They also, says he, “quote the text:
‘For in thy sight shall no man living be justified.’” <span
id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) And his affected answer to this
passage amounts to nothing else than the showing how texts of Holy
Scripture seem to clash with one another, whereas it is our duty rather
to demonstrate their agreement. These are his words: “We must confront
them with this answer, from the testimony of the evangelist concerning
holy Zacharias and Elisabeth, when he says, ‘And they were both
righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of
the Lord blameless.’”  <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546.md) Now
both these righteous persons had, of course, read amongst these very
commandments the method of cleansing their own sins. For, according to
what is said in the Epistle to the Hebrews of “every high priest taken
from among men,” <span id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) Zacharias
used no doubt to offer sacrifices even for his own sins. The meaning,
however, of the phrase “*blameless*,” which is applied to him, we have
already, as I suppose, sufficiently explained. <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md) “And,” he adds, “the blessed
apostle says, ‘That we should be holy, and without blame before
Him.’” <span id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) This, according to
him, is said that we should be so, if those persons are to be understood
by “*blameless*” who are altogether without sin. If, however, they are
“*blameless*” who are without blame or censure, then it is impossible
for us to deny that there have been, and still are, such persons even in
this present life; for it does not follow that a man is without sin
because he has not a blot of accusation. Accordingly the apostle, when
selecting ministers for ordination, does not say, “If any be *sinless*,”
for he would be unable to find any such; but he says, “If any be without
accusation,” <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) for such, of
course, he would be able to find. But our opponent does not tell us how,
in accordance with his views, we ought to understand the scripture, “For
in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.” <span
id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md) The meaning of these words is plain
enough, receiving as it does additional light from the preceding clause:
“Enter not,” says the Psalmist, “into judgment with Thy servant, for in
Thy sight shall no man living be justified.” It is judgment which he
fears, therefore he desires that mercy which triumphs over
judgment. <span id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md) For the meaning of
the prayer, “Enter not into judgment with Thy servant,” is this: “Judge
me not according to Thyself,” who art without sin; “for in Thy sight
shall no man living be justified.” This without doubt is understood as
spoken of the present life, whilst the predicate “shall not be
justified” has reference to that perfect state of righteousness which
belongs not to this life.
