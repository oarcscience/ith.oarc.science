<span id="xi.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 62.—He Returns to the Question Which
Marcellinus Had Proposed to Him.</span>

<span id="xi.lxv-p2"></span>But I beg of you to advert to the question
which you proposed to me, and to what we have made out of it in the
lengthy process of this discussion. You were perplexed how I could have
said that it was possible for a man to be without sin, if his will were
not wanting, by the help of God’s aid, although no man in the present
life had ever lived, was living, or would live, of such perfect
righteousness. Now, in the books which I formerly addressed to you, I
set forth this very question. I said: “If I were asked whether it be
possible for a man to be without sin in this life, I should allow the
possibility, by the grace of God, and his own free will; for I should
have no doubt that the free will itself is of God’s grace,—that is, has
its place among the gifts of God,—not only as to its existence, but also
in respect of its goodness; that is, that it applies itself to doing the
commandments of God. And so, God’s grace not only shows what ought to be
done, but also helps to the possibility of doing what it shows.” <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073) You seemed to think it absurd, that
a thing which was possible should be unexampled. Hence arose the subject
treated of in this book; and thus did it devolve on me to show that a
thing was possible although no example of it could be found. We
accordingly adduced certain cases out of the gospel and of the law, at
the beginning of this work,—such as the passing of a camel through the
eye of a needle; <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074) and the
twelve thousand legions of angels, who could fight for Christ, if He
pleased; <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075) and those nations
which God said He could have exterminated at once from the face of His
people, <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076) —none of which
possibilities were ever reduced to fact. To these instances may be added
those which are referred to in the Book of Wisdom, <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077) suggesting how many are the strange
torments and troubles which God was able to employ against ungodly men,
by using the creature which was obedient to His beck, which, however, He
did not employ. One might also allude to that mountain, which faith
could remove into the sea, <span id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078)
although, nevertheless, it was never done, so far as we have ever
read <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079) or heard. Now you see
how thoughtless and foolish would be the man who should say that any one
of these things is impossible with God, and how opposed to the sense of
Scripture would be his assertion. Many other cases of this kind may
occur to anybody who reads or thinks, the possibility of which with God
we cannot deny, although an example of them be lacking.

with the statement of Eusebius, as translated by Rufinus (*Hist*. vi.

performed the miracle of removing a mountain or rock from its place;
which Bede also mentions, *Comment*. on [Mark
