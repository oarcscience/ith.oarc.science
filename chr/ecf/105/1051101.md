<span id="xxi.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Why Does God Mingle Those Who
Will Persevere with Those Who Will Not?</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxi-p2"></span>Let the inquirer still go on, and say,
“Why is <span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.xxi-Page_532"></span>it that to some who have in good faith
worshipped Him He has not given to persevere to the end?” Why except
because he does not speak falsely who says, “They went out from us, but
they were not of us; for if they had been of us, doubtless they would
have continued with us.” <span id="fr_3594"></span>[3595](#fn_3594) Are
there, then, two natures of men? By no means. If there were two natures
there would not be any grace, for there would be given a gratuitous
deliverance to none if it were paid as a debt to nature. But it seems to
men that all who appear good believers ought to receive perseverance to
the end. But God has judged it to be better to mingle some who would not
persevere with a certain number of His saints, so that those for whom
security from temptation in this life is not desirable may not be
secure. For that which the apostle says, checks many from mischievous
elation: “Wherefore let him who seems to stand take heed lest he
fall.” <span id="fr_3595"></span>[3596](#fn_3595) But he who falls,
falls by his own will, and he who stands, stands by God’s will. “For God
is able to make him stand;” <span id="fr_3596"></span>[3597](#fn_3596)
therefore he is not able to make himself stand, but God. Nevertheless,
it is good not to be high-minded, but to fear. Moreover, it is in his
own thought that every one either falls or stands. Now, as the apostle
says, and as I have mentioned in my former treatise, “We are not
sufficient to think anything of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of
God.” <span id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597) Following whom also the
blessed Ambrose ventures to say, “For our heart is not in our own power,
nor are our thoughts.” And this everybody who is humbly and truly pious
feels to be most true.
