<span id="xviii.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Why One of the Covenants is
Called Old, the Other New.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xiii-p2"></span>But some one will say, “In what way is
that called the old which was given by Moses four hundred and thirty
years after; and that called the new which was given so many years
before to Abraham?” Let him who on this subject is disturbed, not
litigiously but earnestly, first understand that when from its earlier
time one is called “old,” and from its posterior time the other “new,”
it is the revelation of them that is considered in their names, not
their institution. Because the old testament was revealed through Moses,
by whom the holy and just and good law was given, whereby should be
brought about not the doing away but the knowledge of sin,—by which the
proud might be convicted who were desirous of establishing their own
righteousness, as if they had no need of divine help, and being made
guilty of the letter, might flee to the Spirit of grace, not to be
justified by their own righteousness, but by that of God—that <span
id="page_408">p. 408</span> <span id="xviii.v.xiii-Page_408"></span>is,
by the righteousness which was given to them of God. For as the same
apostle says, “By the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the
righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by
the law and by the prophets.” <span id="fr_2727"></span>[2728](#fn_2727)
Because the law, by the very fact that in it no man is justified,
affords a witness to the righteousness of God. For that in the law no
man is justified before God is manifest, because “the just by faith
lives.” <span id="fr_2728"></span>[2729](#fn_2728) Thus, therefore,
although the law does not justify the wicked when he is convicted of
transgression, it sends to the God who justifieth, and thus affords a
testimony to the righteousness of God. Moreover, the prophets offer
testimony to God’s righteousness by fore-announcing Christ, “who is made
unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
redemption: that, as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in
the Lord.” <span id="fr_2729"></span>[2730](#fn_2729) But that law was
kept hidden from the beginning, when nature itself convicted wicked men,
who did to others what they would not have done to themselves. But the
revelation of the new testament in Christ was made when He was
manifested in the flesh, wherein appeared the righteousness of God—that
is, the righteousness which is to men from God. For hence he says, “But
now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested.” <span
id="fr_2730"></span>[2731](#fn_2730) This is the reason why the former
is called the old testament, because it was revealed in the earlier
time; and the latter the new, because it was revealed in the later time.
In a word, it is because the old testament pertains to the old man, from
which it is necessary that a man should make a beginning; but the new to
the new man, by which a man ought to pass from his old state. Thus, in
the former are earthly promises, in the latter heavenly promises;
because this pertained to God’s mercy, that no one should think that
even earthly felicity of any kind whatever could be conferred on
anybody, save from the Lord, who is the Creator of all things. But if
God is worshipped for the sake of that earthly happiness, the worship is
that of a slave, belonging to the children of the bondmaid; but if for
the sake of God Himself, so that in the life eternal God may be all
things in all, it is a free service belonging to the children of the
freewoman, who is our mother eternal in the heavens—who first seemed, as
it were, barren, when she had not any children manifest; but now we see
what was prophesied concerning her: “Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest
not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for there are many
children of the desolate more than of her who has an husband,” <span
id="fr_2731"></span>[2732](#fn_2731) —that is, more than of that
Jerusalem, who in a certain manner is married in the bond of the law,
and is in bondage with her children. In the time, then, of the old
testament, we say that the Holy Spirit, in those who even then were the
children of promise according to Isaac, was not only an assistant, which
these men think is sufficient for their opinion, but also a bestower of
virtue; and this they deny, attributing it rather to their free will, in
contradiction to those fathers who knew how to cry unto God with
truthful piety, “I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength.” <span
