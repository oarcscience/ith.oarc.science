<span id="xx.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—None of the Elect and Predestinated
Can Perish.</span>

<span id="xx.xvii-p2"></span>Of such says the apostle, “We know that to
those that love God He worketh together all things for good, to them who
are called according to His purpose; because those whom He before
foreknew, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His
Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom
He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He
also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.”  <span
id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292) Of these no one perishes, because
all are elected. And they are elected because they were called according
to the purpose—the purpose, however, not their own, but God’s; of which
He elsewhere says, “That the purpose of God according to election might
stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said unto her that
the elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293) And in another place he says, “Not
according to our works, but according to His own purpose and
grace.” <span id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294) When, therefore, we
hear, “Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called,” <span
id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295) we ought to acknowledge that they
were called according to His purpose; since He thence began, saying, “He
worketh together all things for good to those who are called according
to His purpose,” and then added, “Because those whom He before foreknew,
He also did predestinate, to be conformed to the image of His Son, that
He might be the first-born among many brethren.” And to these promises
He added, “Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called.” He
wishes these, therefore, to be understood whom He called according to
His purpose, lest any among them should be thought to be called and not
elected, on account of that sentence of the Lord’s: “Many the called but
few are elected.” <span id="fr_3296"></span>[3297](#fn_3296) For whoever
are elected are without doubt also called; but not whosoever are called
are as a consequence elected. Those, then, are elected, as has often
been said, who are called according to the purpose, who also are
predestinated and foreknown. If any one of these perishes, God is
mistaken; but none of them perishes, because God is not mistaken. If any
one of these perish, God is overcome by human sin; but none of them
perishes, because God is overcome by nothing. Moreover, they are elected
to reign with Christ, not as Judas was elected, to a work for which he
was fitted. Because he was chosen by Him who well knew how to make use
even of wicked men, so that even by his damnable deed that venerable
work, for the sake of which He Himself had come, might be accomplished.
When, therefore, we hear, “Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
is a devil?” <span id="fr_3297"></span>[3298](#fn_3297) we ought to
understand that the rest were elected by mercy, but he by judgment;
those to obtain His kingdom, he to shed His blood!
