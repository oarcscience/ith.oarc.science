<span id="xxi.iii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—Exhortation to Wisdom, Though
Wisdom is God’s Gift.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xlvi-p2"></span>Now, to say nothing more of
continency, and to argue in this place of wisdom alone, certainly the
Apostle James above mentioned says, “But the wisdom that is from above
is first pure, then peaceable, modest, easy to be entreated, full of
mercy and good fruits, inestimable, without simulation.” <span
id="fr_3668"></span>[3669](#fn_3668.md) Do you not see, I beseech you, how
this wisdom descends from the Father of Lights, laden with many and
great benefits? Because, as the same apostle says, “Every excellent gift
and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of
Lights.” <span id="fr_3669"></span>[3670](#fn_3669.md) Why, then—to set
aside other matters—do we rebuke the impure and contentious, to whom we
nevertheless preach that the gift of God is wisdom, pure and peaceable;
and are not afraid that they should be influenced, by the uncertainty of
the divine will, to find in this preaching more of despair than of
exhortation; and that they should not be stirred up by the incentives of
rebuke rather against us than against themselves, because we rebuke them
for not having those things which we ourselves say are not produced by
human will, but are given by the divine liberality? Finally, why did the
preaching of this grace not deter the Apostle James from rebuking
restless souls, and saying, “If ye have bitter envying, and contentions
are in your hearts, glory not, and be not liars against the truth. This
is not <span id="page_544">p. 544</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.xlvi-Page_544"></span>the wisdom that cometh down from
above, but is earthly, animal, devilish; for where envying and
contention are, there are inconstancy and every evil work”? <span
id="fr_3670"></span>[3671](#fn_3670.md) As, therefore, the restless are to
be rebuked, both by the testimony of the divine declarations, and by
those very impulses of ours which they have in common with ourselves;
and is it no argument against this rebuke that we declare the peaceful
wisdom, whereby the contentions are corrected and healed, to be the gift
of God; unbelievers are in such wise to be rebuked, as those who do not
abide in the faith, without any hindrance to that rebuke from the
preaching of God’s grace, although that preaching commends that very
grace and the continuance in it as the gifts of God. Because, although
wisdom is obtained from faith, even as James himself, when he had said,
“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all
liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given,” <span
id="fr_3671"></span>[3672](#fn_3671.md) immediately added, “But let him ask
in faith, nothing wavering:” it is not, nevertheless, because faith is
given before it is asked for by him to whom it is given, that it must
therefore be said not to be the gift of God, but to be of ourselves,
because it is given to us without our asking for it! For the apostle
very plainly says, “Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith from
God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_3672"></span>[3673](#fn_3672.md) From whom, therefore, are peace and
love, from Him also is faith; wherefore, from Him we ask not only that
it may be increased to those that possess it, but also that it may be
given to those that possess it not.
