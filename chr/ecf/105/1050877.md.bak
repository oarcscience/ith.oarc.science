<span id="xviii.v.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Distinction Between the Children
of the Old and of the New Testaments.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xi-p2"></span>But there is plainly this great
difference, that they who are established under the law, whom the letter
killeth, do these things either with the desire of gaining, or with the
fear of losing earthly happiness; and that thus they do not truly do
them, since fleshly desire, by which sin is rather bartered or
increased, is not healed by desire of another kind. These pertain to the
old testament, which genders to bondage; because carnal fear and desire
make them servants, gospel faith and hope and love do not make them
children. But they who are placed under grace, whom the Spirit quickens,
do these things of faith which worketh by love in the hope of good
things, not carnal but spiritual, not earthly but heavenly, not temporal
but eternal; especially believing on the Mediator, by whom they do not
doubt but that a Spirit of grace is ministered to them, so that they may
do these things well, and that they may be pardoned when they sin. These
pertain to the new testament, are the children of promise, and are
regenerated by God the Father and a free mother. Of this kind were all
the righteous men of old, and Moses himself, the minister of the old
testament, the heir of the new,—because of the faith whereby we live, of
one and the same they lived, believing the incarnation, passion, and
resurrection of Christ <span id="page_407">p. 407</span> <span
id="xviii.v.xi-Page_407"></span>as future, which we believe as already
accomplished,—even until John the Baptist himself, as it were a certain
limit of the old dispensation, who, signifying that the Mediator Himself
would come, not with any shadow of the future or allegorical intimation,
or with any prophetical announcement, but pointing Him out with his
finger, said: “Behold the Lamb of God; behold Him who taketh away the
sin of the world.” <span id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) As if
saying, Whom many righteous men have desired to see, on whom, as about
to come, they have believed from the beginning of the human race itself,
concerning whom the promises were spoken to Abraham, of whom Moses
wrote, of whom the law and the prophets are witnesses: “Behold the Lamb
of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.” From this John and
afterwards, all those things concerning Christ began to become past or
present, which by all the righteous men of the previous time were
believed, hoped for, desired, as future. Therefore the faith is the same
as well in those who, although not yet in name, were in fact previously
Christians, as in those who not only are so but are also called so; and
in both there is the same grace by the Holy Spirit. Whence says the
apostle: “We having the same Spirit of faith, according as it is
written, I believed, therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and
therefore speak.” <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md)
