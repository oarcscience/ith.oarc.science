<span id="xii.lxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 75.—Augustin Adduces in Reply Some
Other Passages of Ambrose.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxix-p2"></span>I, too, will quote a passage out of this
very work of St. Ambrose, from which our opponent has taken the
statement which he deemed favourable for citation: “‘It seemed good to
me,’” he says; “but what he declares seemed good to him cannot have
seemed good to him alone. For it is not simply to his human will that it
seemed good, but also as it pleased Him, even Christ, who, says he,
speaketh in me, who it is that causes that which is good in itself to
seem good to ourselves also. For him on whom He has mercy He also calls.
He, therefore, who follows Christ, when asked why he wished to be a
Christian, can answer: ‘It seemed good to me.’ In saying this he does
not deny that it also pleased God; for from God proceeds the preparation
of man’s will inasmuch as it is by God’s grace that God is honoured by
His saint.” <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) See now what your
author must learn, if he takes pleasure in the words of Ambrose, how
that man’s will is prepared by God, and that it is of no importance, or,
at any rate, does not much matter, by what means or at what time the
preparation is accomplished, provided no doubt is raised as to whether
the thing itself be capable of accomplishment without the grace of
Christ. Then, again, how important it was that he should observe one
line from the words of Ambrose which he quoted! For after that holy man
had said, “Inasmuch as the Church has been gathered out of the world,
that is, out <span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="xii.lxxix-Page_148"></span>of sinful men, how can it be unpolluted
when composed of such polluted material, except that, in the first
place, it be washed of sins by the grace of Christ, and then, in the
next place, abstain from sins through its nature of avoiding sin?”—he
added the following sentence, which your author has refused to quote for
a self-evident reason; for \[Ambrose\] says: “It was not from the first
unpolluted, for that was impossible for human nature: but it is through
God’s grace and nature that because it no longer sins, it comes to pass
that it seems unpolluted.” <span id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md)
Now who does not understand the reason why your author declined adding
these words? It is, of course, so contrived in the discipline of the
present life, that the holy Church shall arrive at last at that
condition of most immaculate purity which all holy men desire; and that
it may in the world to come, and in a state unmixed with anything of
evil men, and undisturbed by any law of sin resisting the law of the
mind, lead the purest life in a divine eternity. Still he should well
observe what Bishop Ambrose says,—and his statement exactly tallies with
the Scriptures: “It was not from the first unpolluted, for that
condition was impossible for human nature.” By his phrase, “from the
first,” he means indeed from the time of our being born of Adam. Adam no
doubt was himself created immaculate; in the case, however, of those who
are by nature children of wrath, deriving from him what in him was
corrupted, he distinctly averred that it was an impossibility in human
nature that they should be immaculate from the first.
