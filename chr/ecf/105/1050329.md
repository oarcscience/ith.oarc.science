<span id="xii.lxxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 82 \[LXVIII.\]—How to Exhort Men to
Faith, Repentance, and Advancement.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxxvi-p2"></span>If, therefore, we wish “to rouse and
kindle cold and sluggish souls by Christian exhortations to lead
righteous lives,” <span id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342) we must
first of all exhort them to that faith whereby they may become
Christians, and be subjects of His name and authority, without whom they
cannot be saved. If, however, they are already Christians but neglect to
lead holy lives, they must be chastised with alarms and be aroused by
the praises of reward,—in such a manner, indeed, that we must not forget
to urge them to godly prayers as well as to virtuous actions, and
furthermore to instruct them in such wholesome doctrine that they be
induced thereby to return thanks for being able to accomplish any step
in that holy life which they have entered upon, without
difficulty, <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343) and whenever they
do experience such “difficulty,” that they then wrestle with God in most
faithful and persistent prayer and ready works of mercy to obtain from
Him facility. But provided they thus progress, I am not over-anxious as
to the *where* and the *when* of their perfection in fulness of
righteousness; only I solemnly assert, that wheresoever and whensoever
they become perfect, it cannot be but by the grace of God through our
Lord Jesus Christ. When, indeed, they have attained to the clear
knowledge that they have no sin, let them not say they have sin, lest
the truth be not in them; <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344)
even as the truth is not in those persons who, though they have sin, yet
say that they have it not.
