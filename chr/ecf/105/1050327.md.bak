<span id="xii.lxxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 80 \[LXVII.\]—Augustin Himself. Two
Methods Whereby Sins, Like Diseases, are Guarded Against.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxxiv-p2"></span>Let us now turn to our own case. “Bishop
Augustin also,” says your author, “in his books on Free Will has these
words: ‘Whatever the cause itself of volition is, if it is impossible to
resist it, submission to it is not sinful; if, however, it may be
resisted, let it not be submitted to, and there will be no sin. Does it,
perchance, deceive the unwary man? Let him then beware that he be not
deceived. Is the deception, however, so potent that it is not possible
to guard against it? If such is the case, then there are no sins. For
who sins in a case where precaution is quite impossible? Sin, however,
is committed; precaution therefore is possible.’” <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) I acknowledge it, these are my
words; but he, too, should condescend to acknowledge all that was said
previously, seeing that the discussion is about the grace of God, which
helps us as a medicine through the Mediator; not about the impossibility
of righteousness. Whatever, then, may be the cause, it can be resisted.
Most certainly it can. Now it is because of this that we pray for help,
saying, “Lead us not into temptation,” <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) and we should not ask for help if
we supposed that the resistance were quite impossible. It is possible to
guard against sin, but by the help of Him who cannot be deceived. <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) For this very circumstance has much
to do with guarding against sin that we can unfeignedly say, “Forgive us
our debt, as we forgive our debtors.” <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) Now there are two ways whereby,
even in bodily maladies, the evil is guarded against,—to prevent its
occurrence, and, if it happen, to secure a speedy cure. To prevent its
occurrence, we may find precaution in the prayer, “Lead us not into
temptation;” to secure the prompt remedy, we have the resource in the
prayer, “Forgive us our debts.” Whether then the danger only threaten or
be inherent, it may be guarded against.
