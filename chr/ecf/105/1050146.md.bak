<span id="x.iv.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 57 \[XXXV.\]—Turn to Neither
Hand.</span>

<span id="x.iv.lvii-p2"></span>Let us hold fast, then, the confession of
this faith, without faltering or failure. One alone is there who was
born without sin, in the likeness of sinful flesh, who lived without sin
amid the sins of others, and who died without sin on account of our
sins. “Let us turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.” <span
id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) For to turn to the right hand is to
deceive oneself, by saying that we are without sin; and to turn to the
left is to surrender oneself to one’s sins with a sort of impunity, in I
know not how perverse and depraved a recklessness. “God indeed knoweth
the ways on the right hand,” <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md)
even He who alone is without sin, and is able to blot out our sins; “but
the ways on the left hand are perverse,” <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) in friendship with sins. Of such
inflexibility were those youths of twenty years, <span
id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) who foretokened in figure God’s new
people; they entered the land of promise; they, it is said, turned
neither to the right hand nor to the left. <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) Now this age of twenty is not to be
compared with the age of children’s innocence, but if I mistake not,
this number is the shadow and echo of a mystery. For the Old Testament
has its excellence in the five books of Moses, while the New Testament
is most refulgent in the authority of the four Gospels. These numbers,
when multiplied together, reach to the number twenty: four times five,
or five times four, are twenty. Such a people (as I have already said),
instructed in the kingdom of heaven by the two Testaments—the Old and
the New—turning neither to the right hand, in a proud assumption of
righteousness, nor to the left hand, in a reckless delight in sin, shall
enter into the land of promise, where we shall have no longer either to
pray that sins may be forgiven to us, or to fear that they may be
punished in us, having been freed from them all by that Redeemer, who,
not being “sold under sin,” <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md)
“hath redeemed Israel out of all his iniquities,” <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) whether committed in the actual life,
or derived from the original transgression.
