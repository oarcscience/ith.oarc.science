<span id="xi.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—The Passage in Romans.</span>

<span id="xi.xxviii-p2"></span>Now carefully consider this entire
passage, and see whether it says anything about circumcision, or the
Sabbath, or anything else pertaining to a foreshadowing sacrament. Does
not its whole scope amount to this, that the letter which forbids sin
fails to give man life, but rather “killeth,” by increasing
concupiscence, and aggravating sinfulness by transgression, unless
indeed grace liberates us by the law of faith, which is in Christ Jesus,
when His love is “shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is
given to us?” <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) The apostle having
used these words: “That we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in
the oldness of the letter,” <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) goes
on to inquire, “What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay;
I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except
the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the
commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the
law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once; but when the
commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which
was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion
by the commandment deceived me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is
holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which
is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear
sin, worked death in me by that which is good; that sin by the
commandment might become exceeding sinful. For we know that the law is
spiritual; whereas I am carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do I
allow not: for what I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do.
If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is
good. But then it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
me. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.
To will, indeed, is present with me; but how to perform that which is
good I find not. For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which
I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no
more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that,
when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law
of God after the inward man: but I see another law in my members warring
against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of
sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
me from the body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ
out Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with
the flesh the law of sin.”  <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md)
