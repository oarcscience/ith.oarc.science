<p><a name="xvii.vii.xxii-p2"></A>You also say, that &#8220;names cease to be given, when form is not distinguished; and that, where there is no designation of persons, there is no giving of names.&#8221; Your aim is to prove that Abraham&#146;s soul was corporeal, inasmuch as he could be addressed as &#8220;Father Abraham.&#8221; Now, we have already said, that there is form even where there is no body. If, however, you think that where there are not bodies there is no assigning of names, I must beg of you to count the names which occur in this passage of Scripture, &#8220;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2487"></A><A HREF="#fn_2487"><FONT SIZE="1">2488</FONT></A>
 and tell me whether you do not recognise the very things of which these are the names; or whether you recognise them so as to descry some outlines of bodies. Come, tell me, to mention only love, for instance, what are its members, its figure, its colour? For if you are not yourself empty-headed, these appurtenances cannot possibly be regarded by you as an empty thing. Then you go on to say: &#8220;The look and form must, of course, be corporeal of him whose help is implored.&#8221; Well, let men hear what you say; and let no one implore God&#146;s help, because no one can possibly see anything corporeal in Him.</p>
