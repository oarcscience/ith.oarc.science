id="xvii.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[VIII.\]—His Fifth Error. (See
Above in Book I. 8 \[VIII.\] and Book II. 12 \[VIII.\].)</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.xi-p2"></span>Neither believe, nor say, nor teach, if
you wish to be a catholic, that “the soul deserved to be sinful before
any sin.” It is, to be sure, an extremely bad desert to have deserved to
be sinful. And, of course, it could not possibly have incurred so bad a
desert previous to any sin, especially prior to its coming into the
flesh, when it could have possessed no merit either way, either evil or
good. How, then, can you say: “If, therefore, the soul, which could not
be sinful, deserved to be sinful, it yet did not remain in sin, because
as it was prefigured in Christ it was bound not to be in a sinful state,
even as it was unable to be”? Now, just for a little consider what it is
you say, and desist from repeating such a statement. How did the soul
deserve, and how was it unable, to be sinful? How, I pray you tell me,
did that deserve to be sinful which never lived sinfully? How, I ask
again, was that made sinful which was not able to be sinful? Or else, if
you mean your phrase, “*was unable,*” to imply inability apart from the
flesh, how in that case did the soul deserve to be sinful, and by reason
of what desert was it sent into the flesh, when previous to its union
<span id="page_348">p. 348</span> <span
id="xvii.vi.xi-Page_348"></span>with the flesh it was not able to be
sinful, so as to deserve any evil at all?
