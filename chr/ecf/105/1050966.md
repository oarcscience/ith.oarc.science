<span id="xix.iv.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32 \[XVI.\]—In What Sense It is
Rightly Said That, If We Like, We May Keep God’s Commandments.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>The Pelagians think that they know
something great when they assert that “God would not command what He
knew could not be done by man.” Who can be ignorant of this? But God
commands some things which we cannot do, in order that we may know what
we ought to ask of Him. For this is faith itself, which obtains by
prayer what the law commands. He, indeed, who said, “If thou wilt, thou
shalt keep the commandments,” did in the same book of Ecclesiasticus
afterwards say, “Who shall give a watch before my mouth, and a seal of
wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly thereby, and that my
tongue destroy me not.” <span id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md) Now
he had certainly heard and received these commandments: “Keep thy tongue
from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.” <span
id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) Forasmuch, then, as what he said is
true: “If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,” why does he want
a watch to be given before his mouth, like him who says in the Psalm,
“Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth”? <span
id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) Why is he not satisfied with God’s
commandment and his own will; since, if he has the will, he shall keep
the commandments? How many of God’s commandments are directed against
pride! He is quite aware of them; if he will, he may keep them. Why,
therefore, does he shortly afterwards say, “O God, Father and God of my
life, give me not a proud look”? <span
id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) The law had long ago said to him,
“Thou shalt not covet;” <span id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) let
him then only will, and do what he is bidden, because, if he has the
will, he shall keep the commandments. Why, therefore, does he afterwards
say, “Turn away from me concupiscence”? <span
id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) Against luxury, too, how many
commandments has God enjoined! Let a man observe them; because, if he
will, he may keep the commandments. But what means that cry to God, “Let
not the greediness of the belly nor lust of the flesh take hold on
me!”? <span id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121.md) Now, if we were to put
this question to him personally, he would very rightly answer us and
say, From that prayer of mine, in which I offer this particular petition
to God, you may understand in what sense I said, “If thou wilt, thou
mayest keep the commandments.” For it is certain that we keep the
commandments if we will; but because the will is prepared by the Lord,
we must ask of Him for such a force of will as suffices to make us act
by the willing. It is certain that it is we that *will* when we will,
but it is He who makes us will what is good, of whom it is said (as he
has just now expressed it), “The will is prepared by the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) Of the same Lord it is said, “The
steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and his way doth He will.” <span
id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md) Of the same Lord again it is said,
“It is God who worketh in you, even to will!” <span
id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) It is certain that it is we that
act when we act; but it is He who makes us act, by applying efficacious
powers to our will, who has said, “I will make you to walk in my
statutes, and to observe my judgments, and to do them.” <span
id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md) When he says, “I will make you . .
. to do them,” what else does He say in fact than, “I will take away
from you your heart of stone,” <span
id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) from which used to arise your
inability to act, “and I will give you a heart of flesh,” <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) in order that you may act? And what
does this promise amount to but this: I will remove your hard heart, out
of which you did not act, and I will give you an obedient heart, out of
which you shall act? It is He who causes us to act, to whom the human
suppliant says, “Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth.” <span
id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) That is to say: Make or enable me,
O Lord, to set a watch before my mouth,—a benefit which he had already
obtained from God who thus described its influence: “I set a watch upon
my mouth.” <span id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md)
