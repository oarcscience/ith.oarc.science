id="xx.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XI.\]—Distinction Between the
Grace Given Before and After the Fall.</span>

<span id="xx.xxxii-p2"></span>What then? Did not Adam have the grace of
God? Yes, truly, he had it largely, but of a different kind. He was
placed in the midst of benefits which he had received from the goodness
of his Creator; for he had not procured those benefits by his own
deservings; in which benefits he suffered absolutely no evil. But saints
in this life, to whom pertains this grace of deliverance, are in the
midst of evils out of which they cry to God, “Deliver us from evil.”
 <span id="fr_3346"></span>[3347](#fn_3346) He in those benefits needed
not the death of Christ: these, the blood of that Lamb absolves from
guilt, as well inherited as their own. He had no need of that assistance
which they implore when they say, “I see another law in my members
warring against the law of my mind, and making me captive in the law of
sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
me from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ
our Lord.”  <span id="fr_3347"></span>[3348](#fn_3347) Because in them
the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh,
and as they labour and are imperilled in such a contest, they ask that
by the grace of Christ the strength to fight and to conquer may be given
them. He, however, tempted and disturbed in no such conflict concerning
himself against himself, in that position of blessedness enjoyed his
peace with himself.
