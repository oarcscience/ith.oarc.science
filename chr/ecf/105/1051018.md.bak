<span id="xx.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—The Aid Without Which a Thing
Does Not Come to Pass, and the Aid with Which a Thing Comes to
Pass.</span>

<span id="xx.xxxvii-p2"></span>Moreover, the aids themselves are to be
distinguished. The aid without which a thing does not come to pass is
one thing, and the aid by which a thing comes to pass is another. For
without food we cannot live; and yet although food should be at hand, it
would not cause a man to live who should will to die. Therefore the aid
of food is that without which it does not come to pass that we live, not
that by which it comes to pass that we live. But, indeed, when the
blessedness which a man has not is given him, he becomes at once
blessed. For the aid is not only that without which that does not
happen, but also with which that does happen for the sake of which it is
given. Wherefore this is an assistance both by which it comes to pass,
and without which it does not come to pass; because, on the one hand, if
blessedness should be given to a man, he becomes at once blessed; and,
on the other, if it should never be given he will never be so. But food
does not of necessity cause a man to live, and yet without it he cannot
live. Therefore to the first man, who, in that good in which he had been
made upright, had received the ability not to sin, the ability not to
die, the ability not to forsake that good itself, was given the aid of
perseverance,—not that by which it should be brought about that he
should persevere, but that without which he could not of free will
persevere. But now to the saints predestinated to the kingdom of God by
God’s grace, the aid of perseverance that is given is not such as the
former, but such that to them perseverance itself is bestowed; not only
so that without that gift they cannot persevere, but, moreover, so that
by means of this gift they cannot help persevering. For not only did He
say, “Without me ye can do nothing,” <span
id="fr_3355"></span>[3356](#fn_3355.md) but He also said, “Ye have not
chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and
bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.” <span
id="fr_3356"></span>[3357](#fn_3356.md) By which words He showed that He
had given them not only righteousness, but perseverance therein. For
when Christ thus ordained them that they should go and bring forth
fruit, and that their <span id="page_486">p. 486</span> <span
id="xx.xxxvii-Page_486"></span>fruit should remain, who would dare to
say, It shall not remain? Who would dare to say, Perchance it will not
remain? “For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;” <span
id="fr_3357"></span>[3358](#fn_3357.md) but the calling is of those who are
called according to the purpose. When Christ intercedes, therefore, on
behalf of these, that their faith should not fail, doubtless it will not
fail unto the end. And thus it shall persevere even unto the end; nor
shall the end of this life find it anything but continuing.
