id="xii.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 69 \[LIX.\]—Pelagius Puts Nature in
the Place of Grace.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxiii-p2"></span>In opposition, however, to those who
ask, “And who would be unwilling to be without sin, if it were put in
the power of a man?” he rightly contends, saying “that by this very
question they acknowledge that the thing is not impossible; because so
much as this, many, if not all men, certainly desire.” Well then, let
him only confess the means by which this is possible, and then our
controversy is ended. Now the means is “the grace of God through our
Lord Jesus Christ;” by which he nowhere has been willing to allow that
we are assisted when we pray, for the avoidance of sin. If indeed he
secretly allows this, he must forgive us if we suspect otherwise. For he
himself works this result, who, though encountering so much obloquy on
this subject, wishes to entertain the secret opinion, and yet is
unwilling to confess or profess it. It would surely be no great matter
were he to speak out, especially since he has undertaken to handle and
open this point, as if it had been objected against him on the side of
opponents. Why on such occasions did he choose only to defend nature,
and assert that man was so created as to have it in his power not to sin
if he wished not to sin; and, from the fact that he was so created,
definitely say that the power was owing to God’s grace which enabled him
to avoid sin, if he was unwilling to commit it; and yet refuse to say
anything concerning the fact that even nature itself is either, because
disordered, healed by God’s grace through our Lord Jesus Christ or else
assisted by it, because in itself it is so insufficient?
