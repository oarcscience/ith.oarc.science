<span id="xx.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[II.\]—What the Grace of God Through
Jesus Christ is.</span>

<span id="xx.vi-p2"></span>For the grace of God through Jesus Christ our
Lord must be apprehended,—as that by which alone men are delivered from
evil, and without which they do absolutely no good thing, whether in
thought, or will and affection, or in action; not only in order that
they may know, by the manifestation of that grace, what should be done,
but moreover in order that, by its enabling, they may do with love what
they know. Certainly the apostle asked for this inspiration of good will
and work on behalf of those to whom he said, “Now we pray to God that ye
do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do
that which is good.” <span id="fr_3245"></span>[3246](#fn_3245) Who can
hear this and not awake and confess that we have it from the Lord God
that we turn aside from evil and do good?—since the apostle indeed says
not, We admonish, we teach, we exhort, we rebuke; but he says, “We pray
to God that ye do no evil, but that ye should do that which is
good.” <span id="fr_3246"></span>[3247](#fn_3246) And yet he was also in
the habit of speaking to them, and doing all those things which I have
mentioned,—he admonished, he taught, he exhorted, he rebuked. But he
knew that all these things which he was doing in the way of planting and
watering <span id="page_473">p. 473</span> <span
id="xx.vi-Page_473"></span>openly <span
id="fr_3247"></span>[3248](#fn_3247) were of no avail unless He who
giveth the increase in secret should give heed to his prayer on their
behalf. Because, as the same teacher of the Gentiles says, “Neither is
he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth
the increase.” <span id="fr_3248"></span>[3249](#fn_3248)
