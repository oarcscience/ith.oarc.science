<span id="xviii.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[VI.\]—Misrepresentation
Concerning Sin in Christ.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xvi-p2"></span>They have not a righteous advocate, who
are (even if that were the only difference) distinguished absolutely and
widely from the righteous. Be it far from us to say, as they themselves
slanderously affirm, that this just Advocate “spoke falsely by the
necessity of the flesh;” but we say that He, in the likeness of sinful
flesh, in respect of sin, condemned sin. And they, perchance not
understanding this, and being blinded by the desire of
misrepresentation, and ignorant of the number of ways in which the name
of sin is accustomed to be used in the Holy Scriptures, declare that we
affirm sin of Christ. Therefore we assert that Christ both had no
sin,—neither in soul nor in the body; and that, by taking upon Him flesh
in the likeness of sinful flesh, in respect of sin He condemned sin. And
this assertion, somewhat obscurely made by the apostle, is explained in
two ways,—either that the likenesses of things are accustomed to be
called by the names of those things to which they are like, so that the
<span id="page_410">p. 410</span> <span
id="xviii.v.xvi-Page_410"></span>apostle may be understood to have
intended to call this likeness of sinful flesh by the name of “sin;” or
else that the sacrifices for sins were under the law called “sins,” all
which things were figures of the flesh of Christ, which is the true and
only sacrifice for sins,—not only for those which are all washed away in
baptism, but also for those which afterwards creep in from the weakness
of this life, on account of which the universal Church daily cries in
prayer to God, “Forgive us our debts,” and they are forgiven us by means
of that singular sacrifice for sins which the apostle, speaking
according to the law, did not hesitate to call “sin.” Whence, moreover,
is that much plainer passage of his, which is not uncertain by any
twofold ambiguity, “We beseech you in Christ’s stead to be reconciled to
God. He made Him to be sin for us, who had not known sin; that we might
be the righteousness of God in Him.”  <span
id="fr_2738"></span>[2739](#fn_2738.md) For the passage which I have above
mentioned, “In respect of sin, He condemned sin,” because it was not
said, “In respect of *his* sin,” may be understood by any one, as if He
said that He condemned sin in respect of the sin of the Jews; because in
respect of their sin who crucified Him, it happened that He shed His
blood for the remission of sins. But this passage, where God is said to
have made Christ Himself “sin,” who had not known sin, does not seem to
me to be more fittingly understood than that Christ was made a sacrifice
for sins, and on this account was called “sin.”
