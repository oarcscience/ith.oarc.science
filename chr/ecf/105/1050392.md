<span id="xiv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—The Same Continued.</span>

<span id="xiv.xi-p2"></span>As for the passage from the psalm, “He loved
cursing, and it shall come upon him; and he willed not blessing, so it
shall be far removed from him,” <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) which he quoted in the same book of
Chapters, as if to prove that “all men are ruled by their own will,” who
can be ignorant that this is a fault not of nature as God created it,
but of human will which departed from God? The fact indeed is, that even
if he had not loved cursing, and had willed blessing, he would in this
very case, too, deny that his will had received any assistance from God;
in his ingratitude and impiety, moreover, he would submit himself to be
ruled by himself, until he found out by his penalties that, sunk as he
was into ruin, without God to govern him he was utterly unable to direct
his own self. In like manner, from the passage which he quoted in the
same book under the same head, “He hath set fire and water before thee;
stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt; before man are good and
evil, life and death, and whichever he liketh shall be given to
him,” <span id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) it is manifest that, if
he applies his hand to fire, and if evil and death please him, his human
will effects all this; but if, on the contrary, he loves goodness and
life, not alone does his will accomplish the happy choice, but it is
assisted by divine grace. The eye indeed is sufficient for itself, for
not seeing, that is, for darkness; but for seeing, it is in its own
light not sufficient for itself unless the assistance of a clear
external light is rendered to it. God forbid, however, that they who are
“the called according to His purpose, whom He also foreknew, and
predestinated to be conformed to the likeness of His Son,” <span
id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) should be given up to their own
desire to perish. This is suffered only by “the vessels of wrath,” <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) who are perfected for perdition; in
whose very destruction, indeed, God “makes known the riches of His glory
on the vessels of His mercy.” <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md)
Now it is on this account that, after saying, “He is my God, His mercy
shall go before me,” <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) he
immediately adds, “My God will show me vengeance upon my enemies.” <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) That therefore happens to them
which is mentioned in Scripture, “God gave them up to the lusts of their
own heart.” <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) This, however,
does not happen to the predestinated, who are ruled by the Spirit of
God, for not in vain is their cry: “Deliver me not, O Lord, to the
sinner, according to my desire.” <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) With regard, indeed, to the evil
lusts which assail them, their prayer has ever assumed some such shape
as this: “Take away from me the concupiscence of the belly; and let not
the desire of lust take hold of me.” <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) Upon those whom He governs as His
subjects does God bestow this gift; but not upon those who think
themselves capable of governing themselves, and who, in the stiff-necked
confidence of their own will, disdain to have Him as their ruler.
