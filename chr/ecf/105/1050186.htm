<p class="c46"><a name="xi.xiii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xi.xiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 10.&#8212;Christ the True Healer.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xi.xiii-p2"></A>Accordingly, the apostle shows that the same medicine was mystically set forth in the passion and resurrection of Christ, when he says, &#8220;Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is justified from sin. Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him: knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over Him. For in that He died, He died unto sin once; but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_734"></A><A HREF="#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">735</FONT></A>
 Now it is plain enough that here by the mystery of the Lord&#146;s death and resurrection is figured the death of our old sinful life, and the rising of the new; and that here is <A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A> <a name="xi.xiii-Page_87"></A>shown forth the abolition of iniquity and the renewal of righteousness. Whence then arises this vast benefit to man through the letter of the law, except it be through the faith of Jesus Christ?</p>
