id="x.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Pelagius Makes God Unjust.</span>

<span id="x.v.iii-p2"></span>We are driven at last to yield our assent
on divine authority to that which we are unable to investigate with even
the clearest intellect. It is well that they remind us themselves that
Christ’s righteousness is unable to profit any but believers, while they
yet allow that it somewhat profits infants; according to this (as we
have already said) they must, without evasion, find room for baptized
infants among the number of believers. Consequently, if they are not
baptized, they will have to rank amongst those who do not believe; and
therefore they will not even have life, but “the wrath of God abideth on
them,” inasmuch as “he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
but the wrath of God abideth on him;” <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653) and they are under judgment, since “he
that believeth not is condemned already;” <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654) and they shall be condemned, since “he
that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth
not shall be damned.” <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655) Let them,
now, then see to it with what justice they can hold or strive to
maintain that human beings have no part in eternal life, but in the
wrath of God, and incur the divine judgment and condemnation, who are
without sin; if, that is, as they cannot have any actual sin, so also
they have within them no original sin.
