<span id="x.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8 \[VII.\]—(2) Whether There is in
This World a Man Without Sin.</span>

<span id="x.iv.viii-p2"></span>\[*2nd.*\] If, however, I am asked the
second question which I have suggested,—whether there be a sinless
man,—I believe there is not. For I rather believe the Scripture, which
says: “Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall
no man living be justified.” <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md)
There is therefore need of the mercy of God, which “exceedingly
rejoiceth against judgment,” <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) and
which that man shall not obtain who does not show mercy. <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) And whereas the prophet says, “I said,
I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and Thou forgavest the
iniquity of my heart,” <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) he yet
immediately adds, “For this shall every saint pray unto Thee in an
acceptable time.” <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) Not indeed
every sinner, but “every saint;” for it is the voice of saints which
says, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us.” <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) Accordingly
we read, in the Apocalypse of the same Apostle, of “the hundred and
forty and four thousand” saints, “which were not defiled with women; for
they continued virgins: and in their mouth was found no guile; for they
are without fault.” <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) “Without
fault,” indeed, they no doubt are for this reason,—because they truly
found fault with themselves; and for this reason, “in their mouth was
discovered no guile,”—“because if they said they had no sin, they
deceived themselves, and the truth was not in them.” <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) Of course, where the truth was not,
there would be guile; and when a righteous man begins a statement by
accusing himself, he verily utters no falsehood.
