<span id="xiv.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40 \[XVII.\]—The Same
Continued.</span>

<span id="xiv.xliv-p2"></span>Since, then, Pelagius was present when
these passages of the Scriptures were discussed, and by his silence
acknowledged having said that he entertained the same view of their
meaning, how happens it, that, after reconsidering the apostle’s
testimony, as he had just done, and finding that he said: “I am not meet
to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God; but by
the grace of God I am what I am,” <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md) he did not perceive that it was
improper for him to say, respecting the question of the abundance of the
graces which the said apostle received, that he had shown himself
“worthy to receive them,” when the apostle himself not only confessed,
but added a reason to prove, that he was *unworthy* of them—and by this
very fact set forth grace *as grace indeed?* If he could not for some
reason or other consider or recollect the narrative of his holiness the
bishop John, which he had heard some time before, he might surely have
respected his own very recent answer at the synod, and remembered how he
anathematized, but a short while before, the opinions which had been
alleged against him out of Cœlestius. Now among these it was objected to
him that Cœlestius had said: “That the grace of God is bestowed
according to our merits.” If, then, Pelagius truthfully anathematized
this, why does he say that all those graces were conferred on the
apostle because he deserved them? Is the phrase “worthy to receive” of
different meaning from the expression “to receive according to merit”?
Can he by any disputatious subtlety show that a man is worthy who has no
merit? But neither Cœlestius, nor any other, all of whose opinions he
anathematized, has any intention to allow him to throw clouds over the
phrase, and to conceal himself behind them. He presses home the matter,
and plainly says: “And this grace has been placed in my will, according
as I have been either worthy or unworthy of it.” If, then, a statement,
wherein it is declared that “God’s grace is given in proportion to our
deserts, to such as are worthy,” <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md) was rightly and truly condemned by
Pelagius, how could his heart permit him to think, or his mouth to
utter, such a sentence as this: “We say that God gives to the person who
has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces?” <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) Who that carefully considers all
this can help feeling some anxiety about his answer or defence?
