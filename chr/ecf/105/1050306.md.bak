id="xii.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 59 \[LI.\]—In What Sense Pelagius
Attributed to God’s Grace the Capacity of Not Sinning.</span>

<span id="xii.lxiii-p2"></span>In order, however, to escape from the
odium wherewith Christians guard their salvation, he parries their
question when they ask him, “Why do you affirm that man without the help
of God’s grace is able to avoid sin?” by saying, “The actual capacity of
not sinning lies not so much in the power of will as in the necessity of
nature. Whatever is placed in the necessity of nature undoubtedly
appertains to the Author of nature, that is, God. How then,” says he,
“can that be regarded as spoken without the grace of God which is shown
to belong in an especial manner to God?” Here the opinion is expressed
which all along was kept in the background; there is, in fact, no way of
permanently concealing such a doctrine. The reason why he attributes to
the grace of God the capacity of not sinning is, that God is the Author
of nature, in which, he declares, this capacity of avoiding sin is
inseparably implanted. Whenever He wills a thing, no doubt He does it;
and what He wills not, that He does not. Now, wherever there is this
inseparable capacity, there cannot accrue any infirmity of the will; or
rather, there cannot be both a presence of will and a failure in
“performance.” <span id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md) This, then,
being the case, how comes it to pass that “to will is present, but how
to perform that which is good” is not present? Now, if the author of the
work we are discussing spoke of that nature of man, which was in the
beginning created faultless and perfect, in whatever sense his dictum be
taken, “that it has an inseparable capacity,”—that is, so to say, one
which cannot be lost,—then that nature ought not to have been mentioned
at all which could be corrupted, and which could require a physician to
cure the eyes of the blind, and restore that capacity of seeing which
had been lost through blindness. For I suppose a blind man would like to
see, but is unable; but, whenever a man wishes to do a thing and cannot,
there is present to him the will, but he has lost the capacity.
