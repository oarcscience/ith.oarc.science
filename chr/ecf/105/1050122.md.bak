<span id="x.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—Through Grace We Have Both the
Knowledge of Good, and the Delight Which It Affords.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span>But when we pray Him to give us His
help to do and accomplish righteousness, what else do we pray for than
that He would open what was hidden, and impart sweetness to that which
gave no pleasure? For even this very duty of praying to Him we have
learned by His grace, whereas before it was hidden; and by His grace
have come to love it, whereas before it gave us no pleasure,—so that “he
who glorieth must glory not in himself, but in the Lord.” To be lifted
up, indeed, to pride, is the result of men’s own will, not of the
operation of God; for to such a thing God neither urges us nor helps us.
There first occurs then in the will of man a certain desire of its own
power, to become disobedient through pride. If it were not for this
desire, indeed, there would be nothing difficult; and whenever man
willed it, he might refuse without difficulty. There ensued, however,
out of the penalty which was justly due such a defect, that henceforth
it became difficult to be obedient unto righteousness; and unless this
defect were overcome by assisting grace, no one would turn to holiness;
nor unless it were healed by efficient grace would any one enjoy the
peace of righteousness. But whose grace is it that conquers and heals,
but His to whom the prayer is directed: “Convert us, O God of our
salvation, and turn Thine anger away from us?” <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md) And both if He does this, He does it
in mercy, so that it is said of Him, “Not according to our sins hath He
dealt with us, nor hath He recompensed us according to our
iniquities;” <span id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) and when He
refrains from doing this to any, it is in judgment that He refrains. And
who shall say to Him, “What hast Thou done?” when with pious mind the
saints sing to the praise of His mercy and judgment? Wherefore even in
the case of His saints and faithful servants He applies to them a
tardier cure in certain of their failings, in order that, while they are
involved in these, a less pleasure than is sufficient for the fulfilling
of righteousness in all its perfection may be experienced by them at any
good they may achieve, whether hidden or manifest; so that in respect of
His most perfect rule of equity and truth “no man living can be
justified in His sight.” <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md) He does
not in His own self, indeed, wish us to fall under condemnation, but
that we should become humble; and He displays to us all the self-same
grace of His own. Let us not, however, after we have attained facility
in all things, suppose that to be our own which is really His; for that
would be an error most antagonistic to religion and piety. Nor let us
think that we should, because of His grace, continue in the same sins as
of old; but against that very pride, on account of which we are
humiliated in them, let us, above all things, both vigilantly strive and
ardently pray Him, knowing at the same time that it is by His gift that
we have the power thus to strive and thus to pray; so that in every
case, while we look not at ourselves, but raise our hearts above, we may
render thanks to the Lord our God, and whenever we glory, glory in Him
alone.
