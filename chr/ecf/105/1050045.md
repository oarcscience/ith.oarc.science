<span id="x.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—Infants Must Feed on
Christ.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxvii-p2"></span>Will, however, any man be so bold as to
say that this statement has no relation to infants, and that they can
have life in them without partaking of His body and blood—on the ground
that He does not say, Except *one* eat, but “Except *ye* eat;” as if He
were addressing those who were able to hear and to understand, which of
course infants cannot do? But he who says this is inattentive; because,
unless *all* are embraced in the statement, that without the body and
the blood of the Son of man men cannot have life, it is to no purpose
that even the elder age is solicitous of it. For if you attend to the
mere words, and not to the meaning, of the Lord as He speaks, this
passage may very well seem to have been spoken merely to the people whom
He happened at the moment to be addressing; because He does not say,
Except *one* eat; but Except *ye* eat. What also becomes of the
statement which He makes in the same context on this very point: “The
bread that I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world?” <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) For, it is according to this
statement, that we find that sacrament pertains also to us, who were not
in existence at the time the Lord spoke these words; for we cannot
possibly say that we do not belong to “the world,” for the life of which
Christ gave His flesh. Who indeed can doubt that in the term *world* all
persons are indicated who enter the world by being born? For, as He says
in another passage, “The children of this world beget and are begotten.”
 <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) From all this it follows, that
even for the life of *infants* was His flesh given, which He gave for
the life of the world; and that even they will not have life if they eat
not the flesh of the Son of man.
