<span id="xv.iii.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51 \[XLVI.\]—Ambrose Teaches that It
is God that Does for Man What Pelagius Attributes to Free Will.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.li-p2"></span>Let him lend an ear also to the same
godly bishop, who says, in the sixth book of this same book: <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907.md) “The reason why they would not
receive Him is mentioned by the evangelist himself in these words,
‘Because His face was as though He would go to Jerusalem.’ <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908.md) But His disciples had a strong wish
that He should be received into the Samaritan town. God, however, calls
whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He makes religious.” What wise
insight of the man of God, drawn from the very fountain of God’s grace!
“God,” says he, “calls whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He makes
religious.” See whether this is not the prophet’s own declaration: “I
will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will show pity on whom I
will be pitiful;” <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909.md) and the
apostle’s deduction therefrom: “So then,” says he, “it is not of him
that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy.” <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910.md) Now, when even his
model man of our own times says, that “whomsoever God deigns He calls,
and whom He wills He makes religious,” will any one be bold enough to
contend that that man is not yet religious “who hastens to the Lord, and
desires to be directed by Him, and makes his own will depend upon God’s;
who, moreover, cleaves so closely to the Lord, that he becomes (as the
apostle says) ‘one spirit’ with Him?” <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911.md) Great, however, as is this entire
work of a “religious man,” Pelagius maintains that “it is effected only
by the freedom of the will.” But his own blessed Ambrose, whom he so
highly commends in word, is against him, saying, “The Lord God calls
whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He makes religious.” It is God,
then, who makes religious whomsoever He pleases, in order that he may
“hasten to the Lord, and desire to be directed by Him, and make his own
will depend upon God’s, and cleave so closely to the Lord as to become
(as the apostle says) ‘one spirit’ with Him;” and all this none but a
religious man does. Who, then, ever does so much, unless he be made by
God to do it?
