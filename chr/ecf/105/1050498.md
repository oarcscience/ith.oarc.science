<span id="xv.iii.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43 \[XXXIX.\]—The Forgiveness of
Sins and Example of Christ Held by Pelagius Enough to Save the Most
Hardened Sinner.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xliii-p2"></span>That this, indeed, is his meaning,
other words also of his show us,—not contained in this work, but in the
third book of his *Defence of Free Will*, wherein he holds a discussion
with an opponent, who had insisted on the apostle’s words when he says,
“For what I would, that do I not;” <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887) and again, “I see another law in my
members, warring against the law of my mind.” <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888) To this he replied in these words:
“Now that which you wish us to understand of the apostle himself, all
Church writers <span id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889) assert that he
spoke in the person of the sinner, and of one who was still under the
law,—such a man as was, by reason of a very long custom of vice, held
bound, as it were, by a certain necessity of sinning, and who, although
he desired good with his will, in practice indeed was hurried headlong
into evil. In the person, however, of one man,” he continues, “the
apostle designates the people who still sinned under the ancient law.
This nation he declares was to be delivered from this evil of custom
through Christ, who first of all remits all sins in baptism to those who
believe in Him, and then urges them by an imitation of Himself to
perfect holiness, and by the example of His own virtues overcomes the
evil custom of their sins.” Observe in what way he supposes them to be
assisted who sin under the law: they are to be delivered by being
justified through Christ’s grace, as if the law alone were insufficient
for them, without some reinforcement from Christ, owing to their long
habit of sinning; not the inspiration of love by His Holy Spirit, but
the contemplation and copy of His example in the inculcation of virtue
by the gospel. Now here, at any rate, there was the very greatest call
on him to say plainly what grace he meant, seeing that the apostle
closed the very passage which formed the ground of discussion with these
telling words: “O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.” <span id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890) Now, when he places
this grace, not in the aid of His power, but in His example for
imitation, what further hope must we entertain of him, since everywhere
the word “grace” is mentioned by him under an ambiguous generality?
