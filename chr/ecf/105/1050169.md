<span id="x.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—The Sting of Death, What?</span>

<span id="x.v.xx-p2"></span>But even in the passage to the Corinthians,
where he had been treating fully of the resurrection, the apostle
concludes his statement in such a way as not to permit us to doubt that
the death of the body is the result of sin. For after he had said, “This
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality: so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,
and this mortal immortality, then,” he added, “shall be brought to pass
the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death,
where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?” and at last he
subjoined these words: “The sting of death is sin; and the strength of
sin is the law.” <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) Now, because
(as the apostle’s words most plainly declare) death shall then be
swallowed up in victory when this corruptible and mortal shall have put
on incorruption and immortality,—that is, when “God shall quicken even
our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us,”—it manifestly
follows that the sting of the body of this death, which is the contrary
of the resur<span id="page_77">p. 77</span> <span
id="x.v.xx-Page_77"></span>rection of the body, is sin. The sting,
however, is that by which death was made, and not that which death made,
since it is by sin that we die, and not by death that we sin. It is
therefore called “the sting of death” on the principle which originated
the phrase “the tree of life,”—not because the life of man produced it,
but because by it the life of man was made. In like manner “the tree of
knowledge” was that whereby man’s knowledge was made, not that which man
made by his knowledge. So also “the sting of death” is that by which
death was produced, not that which death made. We similarly use the
expression “the cup of death,” since by it some one has died, or might
die,—not meaning, of course, a cup made by a dying or dead man. <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) The sting of death is therefore sin,
because by the puncture of sin the human race has been slain. Why ask
further: the death of what,—whether of the soul, or of the body? Whether
the first which we are all of us now dying, or the second which the
wicked hereafter shall die? There is no occasion for plying the question
so curiously; there is no room for subterfuge. The words in which the
apostle expresses the case answer the questions: “When this mortal,”
says he, “shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death,
where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? The sting of death is
sin, and the strength of sin is the law.” He was treating of the
resurrection of the body, wherein death shall be swallowed up in
victory, when this mortal shall have put on immortality. Then over death
itself shall be raised the shout of triumph, when at the resurrection of
the body it shall be swallowed up in victory; then shall be said to it,
“O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?” To the
death of the body, therefore, is this said. For victorious immortality
shall swallow it up, when this mortal shall put on immortality. I repeat
it, to the death of the body shall it be said, “Where is thy
victory?”—that victory in which thou didst conquer all, so that even the
Son of God engaged in conflict with thee, and by not shrinking but
grappling with thee overcame. In these that die thou hast conquered; but
thou art thyself conquered in these that rise again. Thy victory was but
temporal, in which thou didst swallow up the bodies of them that die.
Our victory will abide eternal, in which thou art swallowed up in the
bodies of them that rise again. “Where is thy sting?”—that is, the sin
wherewithal we are punctured and poisoned, so that thou didst fix
thyself in our very bodies, and for so long a time didst hold them in
possession. “The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the
law.” We all sinned in one, so that we all die in one; we received the
law, not by amendment according to its precepts to put an end to sin,
but by transgression to increase it. For “the law entered that sin might
abound;” <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) and “the Scripture hath
concluded all under sin;” <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) but
“thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ,” <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) in order that “where
sin abounded, grace might much more abound;” <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) and “that the promise by faith of
Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe;” <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) and that we might overcome death by a
deathless resurrection, and sin, “the sting” thereof, by a free
justification.
