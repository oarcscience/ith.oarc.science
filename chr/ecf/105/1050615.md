<span id="xvi.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Augustin Refutes the Passage
Adduced Above.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.ix-p2"></span>Well, now, whoever you are that have said
all this, what you say is by no means true; by no means, I repeat; you
are much deceived, or you aim at deceiving others. We do not deny free
will; but, even as the Truth declares, “if the Son shall make you free,
then shall ye be free indeed.” <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md) It is yourselves who invidiously
deny this Liberator, since you ascribe a vain liberty to yourselves in
your captivity. Captives you are; for “of whom a man is overcome,” as
the Scripture says, “of the same is he brought in bondage;” <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md) and no one except by the grace of
the great Liberator is loosed from the chain of this bondage, from which
no man living is free. For “by one man sin entered into the world, and
death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all have
sinned.” <span id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) Thus, then, God is
the Creator of those that are born in such wise that all pass from the
one into condemnation, who have not the One Liberator by regeneration.
For He is described as “the Potter, forming out of the same lump one
vessel unto honour in His mercy, and another unto dishonour <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) in judgment.” And so runs the
Church’s canticle “mercy and judgment.” <span
id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md) You are therefore only misleading
yourself and others when you say, “If one should affirm, either that
there is free will in man, or that God is the Creator of those that are
born, he is at once set down as a Cœlestian and a Pelagian;” <span
id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md) for the catholic faith says these
things. If, however, any one says that there is a free will in man for
worshipping God aright, without His assistance; and whosoever says that
God is the Creator of those that are born in such wise as to deny that
infants have any need of one to redeem them from the power of the devil:
that is the man who is set down as a disciple of Cœlestius and Pelagius.
Therefore that men have within them a free will, and that God is the
Creator of those that are born, are propositions which we both allow.
You are not Cœlestians and Pelagians for merely saying this. But what
you do really say is this, that any man whatever has freedom enough of
will <span id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.ix-Page_286"></span>for doing good without God’s help, and
that infants undergo no such change as being “delivered from the power
of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God;” <span
id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) and because you say so, you are
Cœlestians and Pelagians. Why, then, do you hide under the covering of a
common dogma for deceit, concealing your own especial delinquency which
has gained for you a party-name; and why, to terrify the ignorant with a
shocking term, do you say of us, “To avoid being called heretics, they
turn Manicheans?”
