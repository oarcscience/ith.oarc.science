<span id="x.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—A Subterfuge of the
Pelagians.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xiii-p2"></span>Daniel, indeed, after the prayer which he
poured out before God, actually says respecting himself, “Whilst I was
praying and confessing my sins, and the sins of my people, before the
Lord my God.” <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) This is the
reason, if I am not mistaken, why in the above-mentioned Prophet Ezekiel
a certain most haughty person is asked, “Art thou then wiser than
Daniel?” <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) Nor on this point can
that be possibly said which some contend for in opposition to the Lord’s
Prayer: “For although,” they say, “that prayer was offered by the
apostles, after they became holy and perfect, and had no sin whatever,
yet it was not in behalf of their own selves, but of imperfect and still
sinful men that they said, ‘Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
debtors.’ They used the word *our*,” they say, “in order to show that in
one body are contained both those who still have sins, and themselves,
who were already altogether free from sin.” Now this certainly cannot be
said in the case of Daniel, who (as I suppose) foresaw as a prophet this
presumptuous opinion, when he said so often in his prayer, “We have
sinned;” and explained to us why he said this, not so as that we should
hear from him, Whilst I was praying and confessing the sins of my people
to the Lord, my God; nor yet confounding distinction, so as that it
would be uncertain whether he had said, on account of the fellowship of
one body, While I was confessing *our* sins to the Lord my God; but he
expresses himself in language so distinct and precise, as if he were
full of the distinction himself, and wanted above all things to commend
it to our notice: “*My sins*,” says he, “*and the sins of my people*.”
Who can gainsay such evidence as this, but he who is more pleased to
defend what he thinks than to find out what he ought to think?
