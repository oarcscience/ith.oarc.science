<span id="xiii.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xlv-p1.1"></span>(41.) Specimens of Pelagian Exegesis.</span>

<span id="xiii.xlv-p2"></span>But I beg of you to see what kind of
objection, after all, he makes, that to him who “willeth and runneth”
there is no necessity for God’s mercy, which actually anticipates him in
order that he may run,—because, forsooth, the apostle says concerning a
certain person, “Let him do what he will,” <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md) —in the matter, as I suppose, which
he goes on to treat, when he says, “He sinneth not, let him
marry!” <span id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) As if indeed it
should be regarded as a great matter to be willing to marry, when the
subject is a laboured discussion concerning the assistance of God’s
grace, or that it is of any great advantage <span id="page_175">p.
175</span> <span id="xiii.xlv-Page_175"></span>to will it, unless God’s
providence, which governs all things, joins together the man and the
woman. Or, in the case of the apostle’s writing to Philemon, that “his
kindness should not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary,”—as if
any good act could indeed be voluntary otherwise than by God’s “working
in us both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.” <span
id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) Or, when the Scripture says in
Deuteronomy, “Life and death hath He set before man and good and evil,”
and admonishes him “to choose life;” as if, forsooth, this very
admonition did not come from God’s mercy, or as if there were any
advantage in choosing life, unless God inspired love to make such a
choice, and gave the possession of it when chosen, concerning which it
is said: “For anger is in His indignation, and in His pleasure is
life.” <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md)

<span id="xiii.xlv-p7"></span>Or again, because it is said, “The
commandments, if thou wilt, shall save thee,” <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) —as if a man ought not to thank
God, because he has a will to keep the commandments, since, if he wholly
lacked the light of truth, it would not be possible for him to possess
such a will. “Fire and water being set before him, a man stretches forth
his hand towards which he pleases;” <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) and yet higher is He who calls man
to his higher vocation than any thought on man’s own part, inasmuch as
the beginning of correction of the heart lies in faith, even as it is
written, “Thou shalt come, and pass on from the beginning of
faith.” <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) Every one makes his
choice of good, “according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of
faith;” <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) and as the Prince of
faith says, “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me
draw him.” <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) And that He spake
this in reference to the faith which believes in Him, He subsequently
explains with sufficient clearness, when He says: “The words that I
speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life; yet there are some
of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were
that believed not, and who should betray Him. And He said, Therefore
said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto
him of my Father.”  <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md)
