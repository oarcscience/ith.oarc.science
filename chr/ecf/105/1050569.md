<span id="xvi.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—A Difficulty as Regards the
Chastity of Unbelievers. None But a Believer is Truly a Chaste
Man. <span id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066) </span>

<span id="xvi.v.iv-p3"></span>What, then, have we to say when conjugal
chastity is discovered even in some unbelievers? Must it be said that
they sin, in that they make a bad use of a gift of God, in not restoring
it to the worship of Him from whom they received it? Or must these
endowments, perchance, be not regarded as gifts of God at all, when they
are not believers who exercise them; according to the apostle’s
sentiment, when he says, “Whatsoever is not of faith is sin?”  <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067) But who would dare to say that a
gift of God is sin? For the soul and the body, and all the natural
endowments which are implanted in the soul and the body, even in the
persons of sinful men, are still gifts of God; for it is God who made
them, and not they themselves. When it is said, “Whatsoever is not of
faith is sin,” only those <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="xvi.v.iv-Page_265"></span>things are meant which men themselves do.
When men, therefore, do without faith those things which seem to
appertain to conjugal chastity, they do them either to please men,
whether themselves or others, or to avoid incurring such troubles as are
incidental to human nature in those things which they corruptly desire,
or to pay service to devils. Sins are not really resigned, but some sins
are overpowered by other sins. God forbid, then, that a man be truly
called chaste who observes connubial fidelity to his wife from any other
motive than devotion to the true God.
