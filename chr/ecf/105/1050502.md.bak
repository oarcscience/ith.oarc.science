id="xv.iii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47 \[XLIII.\]—Ambrose Most Highly
Praised by Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xlvii-p2"></span>“The blessed Bishop Ambrose,” says he,
“in whose writings the Roman faith shines forth with especial
brightness, and whom the Latins have always regarded as the very flower
and glory of their authors, and who has never found a foe bold enough to
censure his faith or the purity of his understanding of the Scriptures.”
Observe the sort as well as the amount of the praises which he bestows;
nevertheless, however holy and learned he is, he is not to be compared
to the authority of the canonical Scripture. The reason of this high
commendation of Ambrose lies in the circumstance, that Pelagius sees
proper to quote a certain passage from his writings to prove that man is
able to live without sin. <span id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md)
This, however, is not the question before us. We are at present
discussing that assistance of grace which helps us towards avoiding sin,
and leading holy lives.
