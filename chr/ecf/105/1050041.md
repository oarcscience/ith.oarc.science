<span id="x.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XVIII.\]—He Refutes Those Who
Allege that Infants are Baptized Not for the Remission of Sins, But for
the Obtaining of the Kingdom of Heaven. <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281) </span>

<span id="x.iii.xxiii-p3"></span>But those persons raise a question, and
appear to adduce an argument deserving of consideration and discussion,
who say that new-born infants receive baptism not for the remission of
sin, but that, since their procreation is not spiritual, they may be
created in Christ, and become partakers of the kingdom of heaven, and by
the same means children and heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.
And yet, when you ask them, whether those that are not baptized, and are
not made joint-heirs with Christ and partakers of the kingdom of heaven,
have at any rate the blessing of eternal life in the resurrection of the
dead, they are extremely perplexed, and find no way out of their
difficulty. For what Christian is there who would allow it to be said,
that any one could attain to eternal salvation without being born again
in Christ,—\[a result\] which He meant to be effected through baptism,
at the very time when such a sacrament <span id="page_24">p. 24</span>
<span id="x.iii.xxiii-Page_24"></span>was purposely instituted for
regenerating in the hope of eternal salvation? Whence the apostle says:
“Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His
mercy He saved us by the laver <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282)
of regeneration.” <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283) This
salvation, however, he says, consists in hope, while we live here below,
where he says, “For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not
hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for
that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.” <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284) Who then could be so bold as to
affirm, that without the regeneration of which the apostle speaks,
infants could attain to eternal salvation, as if Christ died not for
them? For “Christ died for the ungodly.” <span
id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285) As for them, however, who (as is
manifest) never did an ungodly act in all their own life, if also they
are not bound by any bond of sin in their original nature, how did He
die for them, who died for *the ungodly?* If they were hurt by no malady
of original sin, how is it they are carried to the Physician Christ, for
the express purpose of receiving the sacrament of eternal salvation, by
the pious anxiety of those who run to Him? Why rather is it not said to
them in the Church: Take hence these innocents: “they that are whole
need not a physician, but they that are sick;”—Christ “came not to call
the righteous, but sinners?” <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286)
There never has been heard, there never is heard, there never will be
heard in the Church, such a fiction concerning Christ.
