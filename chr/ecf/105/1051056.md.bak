id="xxi.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Did God Promise the Good Works of
the Nations and Not Their Faith, to Abraham?</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xx-p2"></span>Did God, perchance, promise to Abraham in
his seed the good works of the nations, so as to promise that which He
Himself does, but did not promise the faith of the Gentiles, which men
do for themselves; but so as to promise what He Himself does, did He
foreknow that men would effect that faith? The apostle, indeed, does not
speak thus, because God promised children to Abraham, who should follow
the footsteps of his faith, as he very plainly says. But if He promised
the works, and not the faith of the Gentiles certainly since they are
not good works unless they are of faith (for “the righteous lives of
faith,” <span id="fr_3489"></span>[3490](#fn_3489.md) and, “Whatsoever is
not of faith is sin,” <span id="fr_3490"></span>[3491](#fn_3490.md) and,
“Without faith it is impossible to please” <span
id="fr_3491"></span>[3492](#fn_3491) .md), it is nevertheless in man’s
power that God should fulfil what He has promised. For unless man should
do what without the gift of God pertains to man, he will not cause God
to give,—that is, unless man have faith of himself. God does not fulfil
what He has promised, that works of righteousness should be given by
God. And thus that God should be able to fulfil His promises is not in
God’s power, but man’s. And if truth and piety do not forbid our
believing this, let us believe with Abraham, that what He has promised
He is able also to perform. But He promised children to Abraham; and
this men cannot be unless they have faith, therefore He gives faith
also.
