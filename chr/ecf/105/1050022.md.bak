<span id="x.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 \[IV.\]—Even Bodily Death is from
Sin.</span>

<span id="x.iii.iv-p2"></span>But in addition to the passage where God
in punishment said, “Dust thou art, unto dust shalt thou return,” <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) —a passage which I cannot understand
how any one can apply except to the death of the body,—there are other
testimonies likewise, from which it most fully appears that by reason of
sin the human race has brought upon itself not spiritual death merely,
but the death of the body also. The apostle says to the Romans: “But if
Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is
life because of righteousness. If therefore the Spirit of Him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ
Jesus from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies by His Spirit
that dwelleth in you.” <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) I think
that so clear and open a sentence as this only requires to be read, and
not expounded. *The body*, says he, *is dead*, not because of earthly
frailty, as being made of the dust of the ground, but *because of sin*;
what more do we want? And he is most careful in his words: he does not
say “is *mortal*,” but “*dead*.”
