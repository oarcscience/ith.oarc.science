id="xv.iv.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43 \[XXXVIII.\]—Human Offspring,
Even Previous to Birth, Under Condemnation at the Very Root. Uses of
Matrimony Undertaken for Mere Pleasure Not Without Venial Fault.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xliii-p2"></span>Where God did nothing else than by a
just sentence to condemn the man who wilfully sins, together with his
stock; there also, as a matter of course, whatsoever was even not yet
born is justly condemned in its sinful root. In this condemned stock
carnal generation holds every man; and from it nothing but spiritual
regeneration liberates him. In the case, therefore, of regenerate
par<span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span
id="xv.iv.xliii-Page_252"></span>ents, if they continue in the same
state of grace, it will undoubtedly work no injurious consequence, by
reason of the remission of sins which has been bestowed upon them,
unless they make a perverse use of it,—not alone all kinds of lawless
corruptions, but even in the marriage state itself, whenever husband and
wife toil at procreation, not from the desire of natural propagation of
their species, but are mere slaves to the gratification of their lust
out of very wantonness. As for the permission which the apostle gives to
husbands and wives, “not to defraud one another, except with consent for
a time, that they may have leisure for prayer,” <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) he concedes it by way of indulgent
allowance, and not as a command; but this very form of the concession
evidently implies some degree of fault. The connubial embrace, however,
which marriage-contracts point to as intended for the procreation of
children, considered in itself simply, and without any reference to
fornication, is good and right; because, although it is by reason of
this body of death (which is unrenewed as yet by the resurrection)
impracticable without a certain amount of bestial motion, which puts
human nature to the blush, yet the embrace is not after all a sin in
itself, when reason applies the concupiscence to a good end, and is not
overmastered to evil.
