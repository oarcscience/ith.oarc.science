<span id="xii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[VII.\]—He Proceeds to Confute the
Work of Pelagius; He Refrains as Yet from Mentioning Pelagius’
Name.</span>

<span id="xii.xi-p2"></span>However ardent, then, is the zeal which the
author of the book you have forwarded to me entertains against those who
find a defence for their sins in the infirmity of human nature; not
less, nay even much greater, should be our eagerness in preventing all
attempts to render the cross of Christ of none effect. Of none effect,
however, it is rendered, if it be contended that by any other means than
by Christ’s own sacrament it is possible to attain to righteousness and
everlasting life. This is actually done in the book to which I refer—I
will not say by its author wittingly, lest I should express the judgment
that he ought not to be accounted even a Christian, but, as I rather
believe, unconsciously. He has done it, no doubt, with much power; I
only wish that the ability he has displayed were sound and less like
that which insane persons are accustomed to exhibit.
