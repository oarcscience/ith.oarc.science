<span id="xix.iv.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45 \[XXIII\]—The Reason Why One
Person is Assisted by Grace, and Another is Not Helped, Must Be Referred
to the Secret Judgments of God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xlv-p2"></span>You must refer the matter, then, to the
hidden determinations of God, when you see, in one and the same
condition, such as all infants unquestionably have,—who derive their
hereditary evil from Adam,—that one is assisted so as to be baptized,
and another is not assisted, so that he dies in his very bondage; and
again, that one baptized person is left and forsaken in his present
life, who God foreknew would be ungodly, while another baptized person
is taken away from this life, “lest that wickedness should alter his
understanding;” <span id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220) and be sure
that you do not in such cases ascribe unrighteousness or unwisdom to
God, in whom is the very fountain of righteousness and wisdom, but, as I
have exhorted you from the commencement of this treatise, “whereto you
have already attained, walk therein,” <span
id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221) and “even this shall God reveal
unto you,” <span id="fr_3222"></span>[3223](#fn_3222) —if not in this
life, yet certainly in the next, “for there is nothing covered that
shall not be revealed.” <span id="fr_3223"></span>[3224](#fn_3223) When,
therefore, you hear the Lord say, “I the Lord have deceived that
prophet,” <span id="fr_3224"></span>[3225](#fn_3224) and likewise what
the apostle says: “He hath mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He
will He hardeneth,” <span id="fr_3225"></span>[3226](#fn_3225) believe
that, in the case of him whom He permits to be deceived and hardened,
his evil deeds have deserved the judgment; whilst in the case of him to
whom He shows mercy, you should loyally and unhesitatingly recognise the
grace of the God who “rendereth not evil for evil; but contrariwise
blessing.” <span id="fr_3226"></span>[3227](#fn_3226) Nor should you
take away from Pharaoh free will, because in several passages God says,
“I have hardened Pharaoh;” or,” I have hardened or I will harden
Pharaoh’s heart;” <span id="fr_3227"></span>[3228](#fn_3227) for it does
not by any means follow that Pharaoh did not, on this account, harden
his own heart. For this, too, is said of him, after the removal of the
fly-plague from the Egyptians, in these words of the Scripture: “And
Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also; neither would he let the
people go.” <span id="fr_3228"></span>[3229](#fn_3228) Thus it was that
both God hardened him by His just judgment, and Pharaoh by his own free
will. Be ye then well assured that your labour will never be in vain,
if, setting before you a good purpose, you persevere in it to the last.
For God, who fails to render, according to their deeds, only to those
whom He liberates, will then “recompense every man according to his
works.” <span id="fr_3229"></span>[3230](#fn_3229) God will, therefore,
certainly recompense both evil for evil, because He is just; and good
for evil, because He is good; and good for good, because He is good and
just; only, evil for good He will never recompense, because He is not
unjust. He will, therefore, recompense evil for evil—punishment for
unrighteousness; and He will recompense good for evil—grace for
unrighteousness; and He will recompense good for good—grace for grace.
