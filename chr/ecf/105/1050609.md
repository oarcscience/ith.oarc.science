<span id="xvi.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—In This and the Four Next
Chapters He Adduces the Garbled Extracts He Has to Consider.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.iii-p2"></span>The paper which I now answer starts with
this title: “*Headings out of a book written by Augustin, in reply to
which I have culled a few passages out of books*.” I perceive from this
that the person who forwarded these written papers to your Excellency
wanted to make his extracts out of the books he does not name, with a
view, so far as I can judge, to getting a quicker answer, in order that
he might not delay your urgency. Now, after considering what books they
were which he meant, I suppose that it must have been those which
Julianus mentioned in the Epistle he sent to Rome, <span
id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193.md) a copy of which found its way to me
at the same time. For he there says: “They go so far as to allege that
marriage, now in dispute, was not instituted by God,—a declaration which
may be read in a work of Augustin’s, to which I have lately replied in a
treatise of four books.” These are the books, as I believe, from which
the extracts were taken. It would, then, have been perhaps the better
course if I had set myself deliberately to disprove and refute that
entire work of his, <span id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194.md) which he
spread out into four volumes. But I was most unwilling to delay my
answer, even as you yourself lost no time in forwarding to me the
written statements which I was requested to reply to.

<span id="xvi.vi.iii-p4"></span> This Augustin afterwards did by the
publication of six book against Julianus, on receiving his entire work.
Augustin tells us (*Unfinished Work*, i. 19) that he had long
endeavoured to procure a copy of Julianus’ books for the purpose of
refuting them, and only succeeded in getting them after some difficulty
and delay.
