<span id="xii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35 \[XXXI.\]—Why God Does Not
Immediately Cure Pride Itself. The Secret and Insidious Growth of Pride.
Preventing and Subsequent Grace.</span>

<span id="xii.xxxix-p2"></span>But I would indeed so treat these topics,
as to confess myself ignorant of God’s deeper counsel, why He does not
at once heal the very principle of pride, which lies in wait for man’s
heart even in deeds rightly done; and for the cure of which pious souls,
with tears and strong crying, beseech Him that He would stretch forth
His right hand and help their endeavours to overcome it, and somehow
tread and crush it under foot. Now when a man has felt glad that he has
even by some good work overcome pride, from the very joy he lifts up his
head and says: “Behold, I live; why do you triumph? Nay, I live because
you triumph.” Premature, however, this forwardness of his to triumph
over pride may perhaps be, as if it were now vanquished, whereas its
last shadow is to be swallowed up, as I suppose, in that noontide which
is promised in the scripture which says, “He shall bring forth thy
righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday;”  <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) provided that be done which was
written in the preceding verse: “Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust
also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass,” <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md) —not, as some suppose, that they
themselves bring it to pass. Now, when he said, “And He shall bring it
to pass,” he evidently had none other in mind but those who say, We
ourselves bring it to pass; that is to say, we ourselves justify our own
selves. In this matter, no doubt, we do ourselves, too, work; but we are
fellow-workers with Him who does the work, because His mercy anticipates
us. He anticipates us, however, that we may be healed; but then He will
also follow us, that being healed we may grow healthy and strong. He
anticipates us that we may be called; He will follow us that we may be
glorified. He anticipates us that we may lead godly lives; He will
follow us that we may always live with Him, because without Him we can
do nothing. <span id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) Now the
Scriptures refer to both these operations of grace. There is both this:
“The God of my mercy shall anticipate me,” <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md) and again this: “Thy mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.” <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) Let us therefore unveil to Him our
life by confession, not praise it with a vindication. For if it is not
His way, but our own, beyond doubt it is not the right one. Let us
therefore reveal this by making our confession to Him; for however much
we may endeavour to conceal it, it is not hid from Him. It is a good
thing to confess unto the Lord.
