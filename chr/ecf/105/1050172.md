id="x.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Epilogue.</span>

<span id="x.v.xxiii-p2"></span>As for what they say, that some men, by
the use of their reason, have lived, and do live, in this world without
sin, we should wish that it were true, we should strive to make it true,
we should pray that it be true; but, at the same time, we should confess
that it is not yet true. For to those who wish and strive and worthily
pray for this result, whatever sins remain in them are daily remitted
because we sincerely pray, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors.” <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705) Whosoever shall deny
that this prayer is in this life necessary for every righteous man who
knows and does the will of God, except the one Saint of saints, greatly
errs, and is utterly incapable of pleasing Him whom he praises.
Moreover, if he supposes himself to be such a character, “he deceives
himself, and the truth is not in him,” <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706) —for no other reason than that he
thinks what is false. That Physician, then, who is not needed by the
sound, but by the sick, knows how to heal us, and by healing to perfect
us unto eternal life; and He does not in this world take away death,
although inflicted because of sin, from those whose sins He remits, in
order that they may enter on their conflict, and overcome the fear of
death with full sincerity of faith. In some cases, too, He declines to
help even His righteous servants, so long as they are capable of still
higher elevation, to the attainment of a perfect righteousness, in order
that (while in His sight no man living is justified <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) ) we may always feel it to be our duty
to give Him thanks for mercifully bearing with us, and so, by holy
humility, be healed of that first cause of all our failings, even the
swellings of pride. This letter, as my intention first sketched it, was
to have been a short one; it has grown into a lengthy book. Would that
it were as perfect as it has at last become complete!
