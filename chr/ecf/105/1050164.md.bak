Sin.</span>

<span id="x.v.xv-p2"></span>“It is,” they say, “by no means conceded
that God who remits to a man his own sins imputes to him another’s.” He
remits, indeed, but it is to those regenerated by the Spirit, not to
those generated by the flesh; but He imputes to a man no longer the sins
of another, but only his own. They were no doubt the sins of another,
whilst as yet they were not in existence who bore them when propagated;
but now the sins belong to them by carnal generation, to whom they have
not yet been remitted by spiritual regeneration.
