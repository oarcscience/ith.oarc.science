<span id="xi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—No Fruit Good Except It Grow from
the Root of Love.</span>

<span id="xi.xxix-p2"></span>It is evident, then, that the oldness of
the letter, in the absence of the newness of the spirit, instead of
freeing us from sin, rather makes us guilty by the knowledge of sin.
Whence it is written in another part of Scripture, “He that increaseth
knowledge, increaseth sorrow,” <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819)
—not that the law is itself evil, but because the commandment has its
good in the demonstration of the letter, not in the assistance of the
spirit; and if this commandment is kept from the fear of punishment and
not from the love of righteousness, it is servilely kept, not freely,
and therefore it is not kept at all. For no fruit is good which does not
grow from the root of love. If, however, that faith be present which
worketh by love, <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820) then one begins
to delight in the law of God after the inward man, <span
id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821) and this delight is the gift of the
spirit, not of the letter; even though there is another law in our
members still warring against the law of the mind, until the old state
is changed, and passes into that newness which increases from day to day
in the <span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span
id="xi.xxix-Page_95"></span>inward man, whilst the grace of God is
liberating us from the body of this death through Jesus Christ our Lord.
