<span id="xv.iii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46 \[XLII\]—Pelagius Professes to
Respect the Catholic Authors.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xlvi-p2"></span>Such are the particulars which, to the
best of my ability, I have succeeded in obtaining from the writings of
Pelagius, whenever he makes mention of grace. You perceive, however,
that men who entertain such opinions as we have reviewed are “ignorant
of God’s righteousness, and desire to establish their own,” <span
id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892) and are far off from “the
righteousness which we have of God” <span
id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893) and not of ourselves; and this they
ought to have discovered and recognised in the very holy canonical
Scriptures. Forasmuch, however, as they read these Scriptures in a sense
of their own, they of course fail to observe even the most obvious
truths therein. Would that they would but turn their attention in no
careless mood to what might be learned concerning the help of God’s
grace in the writings, at all events, of catholic authors; for they
freely allow that the Scriptures were correctly understood by these, and
that they would not pass them by in neglect, out of an overweening
fondness for their own opinions. For note how this very man Pelagius, in
that very treatise of his so recently put forth, and which he formally
mentions in his self-defence (that is to say, in the third book of his
*Defence of Free Will*), praises St. Ambrose.
