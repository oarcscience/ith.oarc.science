<span id="xx.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[III.\]—Rebuke Must Not Be
Neglected.</span>

<span id="xx.viii-p2"></span>“Then,” say they, “let those who are over
us only prescribe to us what we ought to do, and pray for us that we may
do it; but let them not rebuke and censure us if we should not do it.”
Certainly let all be done, since the teachers of the churches, the
apostles, were in the habit of doing all,—as well prescribing what
things should be done, as rebuking if they were not done, and praying
that they might be done. The apostle prescribes, saying, “Let all your
things be done with love.” <span id="fr_3254"></span>[3255](#fn_3254.md) He
rebukes, saying, “Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you,
because ye have judgments among yourselves. For why do ye not rather
suffer wrong? Why are ye not rather defrauded? Nay, ye do wrong and
defraud; and that, your brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall
not possess the kingdom of God?” <span
id="fr_3255"></span>[3256](#fn_3255.md) Let us hear him also praying: “And
the Lord,” says he, “multiply you, and make you to abound in love one
towards another and towards all men.” <span
id="fr_3256"></span>[3257](#fn_3256.md) He prescribes, that love should be
maintained; he rebukes, because love is not maintained; he prays, that
love may abound. O man! learn by his precept what you ought to have;
learn by his rebuke that it is by your own fault that you have it not;
learn by his prayer whence you may receive what you desire to have.
