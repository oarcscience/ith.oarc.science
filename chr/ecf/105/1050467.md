<span id="xv.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[XI.\]—The Same Continued: “He
Reveals Wisdom.”</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xii-p2"></span>But what shall I say about the
revelation of wisdom? For there is no man who can in the present life
very well hope to attain to the great revelations which were given to
the Apostle Paul; and of course it is impossible to suppose that
anything was accustomed in these revelations to be made known to him but
what appertained to wisdom. Yet for all this he says: “Lest I should be
exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there
was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet
me. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that He would take it
away from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for
my strength is made perfect in weakness.” <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807) Now, undoubtedly, if there were
already in the apostle that perfection of love which admitted of no
further addition, and which could be puffed up no more, there could have
been no further need of the messenger of Satan to buffet him, and
thereby to repress the excessive elation which might arise from
abundance of revelations. What means this elation, however, but a being
puffed up? And of love it has been indeed most truly said, “Love
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.”  <span
id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808) This love, therefore, was still in
process of constant increase in the great apostle, day by day, as long
as his “inward man was renewed day by day,” <span
id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809) and would then be perfected, no
doubt, when he was got beyond the reach of all further vaunting and
elation. But at that time his mind was still in a condition to be
inflated by an abundance of revelations before it was perfected in the
solid edifice of love; for he had not arrived at the goal and
apprehended the prize, to which he was reaching forward in his course.
