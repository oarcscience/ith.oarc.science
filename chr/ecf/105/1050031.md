<span id="x.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[XI.\]—Meaning of the Apostle’s
Phrase “The Reign of Death.”</span>

<span id="x.iii.xiii-p2"></span>“Nevertheless,” says he, “death reigned
from Adam even unto Moses,” <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251)
—that is to say, from <span id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span
id="x.iii.xiii-Page_20"></span>the first man even to the very law which
was promulged by the divine authority, because even it was unable to
abolish the reign of death. Now death must be understood “to reign,”
whenever the guilt of sin <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) so
dominates in men that it prevents their attainment of that eternal life
which is the only true life, and drags them down even to the second
death which is penally eternal. This reign of death is only destroyed in
any man by the Saviour’s grace, which wrought even in the saints of the
olden time, all of whom, though previous to the coming of Christ in the
flesh, yet lived in relation to His assisting grace, not to the letter
of the law, which only knew how to command, but not to help them. In the
Old Testament, indeed, that was hidden (conformably to the perfectly
just dispensation of the times) which is now revealed in the New
Testament. Therefore “death reigned from Adam unto Moses,” in all who
were not assisted by the grace of Christ, that in them the kingdom of
death might be destroyed, “even in those who had not sinned after the
similitude of Adam’s transgression,” <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253) that is, who had not yet sinned of
their own individual will, as Adam did, but had drawn from him original
sin, “who is the figure of him that was to come,” <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254) because in him was constituted the
form of condemnation to his future progeny, who should spring from him
by natural descent; so that from one all men were born to a
condemnation, from which there is no deliverance but in the Saviour’s
grace. I am quite aware, indeed, that several Latin copies of the
Scriptures read the passage thus: “Death reigned from Adam to Moses over
them who have sinned after the similitude of Adam’s
transgression;” <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255) but even this
version is referred by those who so read it to the very same purport,
for they understood those who have sinned in him to have sinned after
the similitude of Adam’s transgression; so that they are created in his
likeness, not only as men born of a man, but as sinners born of a
sinner, dying ones of a dying one, and condemned ones to a condemned
one. However, the Greek copies from which the Latin version was made,
have all, without exception or nearly so, the reading which I first
adduced.
