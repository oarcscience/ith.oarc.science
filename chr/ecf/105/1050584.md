id="xvi.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[XVII.\]—Blessing of
Matrimony.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xix-p2"></span>In matrimony, however, let these nuptial
blessings be the objects of our love—offspring, fidelity, the
sacramental bond. <span id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130.md) Offspring,
not that it be born only, but born again; for it is born to punishment
unless it be born again to life. Fidelity, not such as even unbelievers
observe one towards the other, in their ardent love of the flesh. For
what husband, however impious himself, likes an adulterous wife? Or what
wife, however impious she be, likes an adulterous husband? This is
indeed a natural good in marriage, though a carnal one. But a member of
Christ ought to be afraid of adultery, not on account of himself, but of
his spouse; and ought to hope to receive from Christ the reward of that
fidelity which he shows to his spouse. The sacramental bond, again,
which is lost neither by divorce nor by adultery, should be guarded by
husband and wife with concord and chastity. For it alone is that which
even an unfruitful marriage retains by the law of piety, now that all
that hope of fruitfulness is lost for the purpose of which the couple
married. Let these nuptial blessings be praised in marriage by him who
wishes to extol the nuptial institution. Carnal concupiscence, however,
must not be ascribed to marriage: it is only to be tolerated in
marriage. It is not a good which comes out of the essence of marriage,
but an evil which is the accident of original sin.
