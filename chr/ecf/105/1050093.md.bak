<span id="x.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 \[IV.\]—Concupiscence, How Far in Us;
The Baptized are Not Injured by Concupiscence, But Only by Consent
Therewith.</span>

<span id="x.iv.iv-p2"></span>Concupiscence, therefore, as the law of sin
which remains in the members of this body of death, is born with
infants. In baptized infants, it is deprived of guilt, is left for the
struggle \[of life\], <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) but
pursues with no condemnation, such as die before the struggle.
Unbaptized infants it implicates as guilty and as children of wrath,
even if they die in infancy, draws into condemnation. In baptized
adults, however, endowed with reason, whatever consent their mind gives
to this concupiscence for the commission of sin is an act of their own
will. After all sins have been blotted out, and that guilt has been
cancelled which by nature <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) bound
men in a conquered condition, it still remains,—but not to hurt in any
way those who yield no consent to it for unlawful deeds,—until death is
swallowed up in victory <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) and, in
that perfection of peace, nothing is left to be conquered. Such,
however, as yield consent to it for the commission of unlawful deeds, it
holds as guilty; and unless, through the medicine of repentance, and
through works of mercy, by the intercession in our behalf of the
heavenly High Priest, they be healed, it conducts us to the second death
and utter condemnation. It was on this account that the Lord, when
teaching us to pray, advised us, besides other petitions, to say:
“Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into
tempation, but deliver us from evil.” <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) For evil remains in our flesh, not by
reason of the nature in which man was created by God and wisdom, but by
reason of that offence into which he fell by his own will, and in which,
since its powers are lost, he is not healed with the same facility of
will as that with which he was wounded. Of this evil the apostle says:
“I know that in my flesh dwelleth no good thing;” <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) and it is likewise to the same evil
that he counsels us to give no obedience, when he says: “Let not sin
therefore reign in your mortal body, to obey the lusts thereof.” <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) When, therefore, we have by an
unlawful inclination of our will yielded consent to these lusts of the
flesh, we say, with a view to the cure of this fault, “Forgive us our
debts;” <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) and we at the same time
apply the remedy of a work of mercy, in that we add, “As we forgive our
debtors.” That we may not, however, yield such consent, let us pray for
assistance, and say, “And lead us not into temptation;”—not that God
ever Himself tempts any one with such temptation, “for God is not a
tempter to evil, neither tempteth He any man;” <span
id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) but in order that whenever we feel the
rising of temptation from our concupiscence, we may not be deserted by
His help, in order that thereby we may be able to conquer, and not be
carried away by enticement. We then add our request for that which is to
be perfected at the last, when mortality shall be swallowed up of
life: <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) “But deliver us from
evil.” <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) For then there will exist
no longer a concupiscence which we are bidden to struggle against, and
not to consent to. The whole substance, accordingly, of these three
petitions may be thus briefly expressed: “Pardon us for those things in
which we have been drawn away by concupiscence; help us not to be drawn
away by concupiscence; take away concupiscence from us.”
