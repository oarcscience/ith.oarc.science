<span id="xv.iii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40 \[XXXVII\]—The Help of Grace
Placed by Pelagius in the Mere Revelation of Teaching.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xl-p2"></span>“Let them read moreover” says he, “what I
wrote, <span id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880.md) when I was in the
East, to Christ’s holy virgin Demetrias, and they will find that we so
commend the nature of man as always to add the help of God’s grace.”
Well, I read this letter too; and it had almost persuaded me that he did
acknowledge therein the grace about which our discussion is concerned,
although he did certainly seem in many passages of this work to
contradict himself. But when there also came to my hands those other
treatises which he afterwards wrote for more extensive circulation, I
discovered in what sense he must have intended to speak of
grace,—concealing what he believed under an ambiguous generality, but
employing the term “grace” in order to break the force of obloquy, and
to avoid giving offence. For at the very commencement of this work
(where he says: “Let us apply ourselves with all earnestness to the task
which we have set before us, nor let us have any misgiving because of
our own humble ability; for we believe that we are assisted by the
mother’s faith and her daughter’s merit” <span
id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881) .md) he appeared to me at first to
acknowledge the grace which helps us to individual action; nor did I
notice at once the fact that he might possibly have made this grace
consist simply in the revelation of teaching.
