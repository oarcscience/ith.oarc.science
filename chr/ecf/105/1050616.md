<span id="xvi.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—The Catholics Maintain the Doctrine
of Original Sin, and Thus are Far from Being Manicheans.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.x-p2"></span>Listen, then, for a little while, and
observe what is involved in this question. Catholics say that human
nature was created good by the good God as Creator; but that, having
been corrupted by sin, it needs the physician Christ. The Manicheans
affirm, that human nature was not created by God good, and corrupted by
sin; but that man was formed by the prince of eternal darkness of a
mixture of two natures which had ever existed—one good and the other
evil. The Pelagians and Cœlestians say that human nature was created
good by the good God; but that it is still so sound and healthy in
infants at their birth, that they have no need at that age of Christ’s
medicine. Recognise, then, your name in your dogma; and cease from
intruding upon the catholics, who refute you, a name and a dogma which
belong to others. For truth rejects both parties—the Manicheans and
yourselves. To the Manicheans it says: “Have ye not read that He which
made man at the beginning, made them male and female; and said, For this
cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;
and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but
one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.” <span id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212) Now Christ shows,
in this passage, that God is both the Creator of man, and the uniter in
marriage of husband and wife; whereas the Manicheans deny both these
propositions. To you, however, He says: “The Son of man is come to seek
and to save that which is lost.” <span
id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213) But you, admirable Christians as
you are, answer Christ: “If you came to seek and to save that which was
lost, then you did not come for infants; for they were not lost, but are
born in a state of salvation: go to older men; we give you a rule from
your own words: ‘They that be whole need not a physician, but they that
are sick.’” <span id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214) Now, as it
happens, the Manichean, who says that man has evil mixed in his nature,
must wish his good soul at any rate to be saved by Christ; whereas you
contend that there is in infants nothing to be sired by Christ, since
they are already safe. <span id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215) And
thus the Manichean besets human nature with his detestable censure, and
you with your cruel praise. For whosoever shall believe your laudation,
will never bring their babes to the Saviour. Entertaining such impious
views as these, of what use is it that you fearlessly face that which is
enacted for you <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216) in order to
induce salutary fear and to treat you as a human being, and not as that
poor animal of yours which was surrounded with the coloured feathers to
be driven into the hunting toils? Need was that you should hold the
truth, and, on account of zeal for it, have no fear; but, as things are,
you evade fear in such wise that, if you feared, you would rather run
away from the net of the malignant one than run into it. The reason why
your catholic mother alarms you is, because she fears for both you and
others from you; and if by the help of her sons who possess any
authority in the State she acts with a view to make you afraid, she does
so, not from cruelty, but from love. You, however, are a very brave man;
and you deem it the coward’s part to be afraid of men. Well then, fear
God; and do not try with such obstinacy to subvert the ancient
foundations of the catholic faith. Although I could even wish that
spirited temper of yours would entertain some little fear of human
authority, at least in the present case. I could wish, I say, that it
would rather tremble through cowardice than perish through audacity.
