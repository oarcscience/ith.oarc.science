<span id="xxi.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—It is in the Power of Evil
Men to Sin; But to Do This or That by Means of that Wickedness is in
God’s Power Alone.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxiii-p2"></span>Moreover, it was this that he had in
view when he said, “The gifts and calling of God are without
repentance.” <span id="fr_3514"></span>[3515](#fn_3514.md) And in that
saying also consider for a little what was its purport. For when he had
said, “For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
mystery, that ye may not be wise in yourselves, that blindness in part
is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and
so all Israel should be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of
Sion one who shall deliver, and turn away impiety from Jacob: and this
is the <span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.xxxiii-Page_514"></span>covenant to them from me, when I
shall take away their sins;” <span id="fr_3515"></span>[3516](#fn_3515.md)
he immediately added, what is to be very carefully understood, “As
concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes: but as
concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers’
sakes.” <span id="fr_3516"></span>[3517](#fn_3516.md) What is the meaning
of, “as concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake,”
but that their enmity wherewith they put Christ to death was, without
doubt, as we see, an advantage to the gospel? And he shows that this
came about by God’s ordering, who knew how to make a good use even of
evil things; not that the vessels of wrath might be of advantage to Him,
but that by His own good use of them they might be of advantage to the
vessels of mercy. For what could be said more plainly than what is
actually said, “As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for
your sakes”? It is, therefore, in the power of the wicked to sin; but
that in sinning they should do this or that by that wickedness is not in
their power, but in God’s, who divides the darkness and regulates it; so
that hence even what they do contrary to God’s will is not fulfilled
except it be God’s will. We read in the Acts of the Apostles that when
the apostles had been sent away by the Jews, and had come to their own
friends, and shown them what great things the priests and elders said to
them, they all with one consent lifted up their voices to the Lord and
said, “Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the
sea, and all things that are therein; who, by the mouth of our father
David, thy holy servant, hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the
peoples imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the
princes were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ.
For in truth, there have assembled together in this city against Thy
holy child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, Herod and Pilate, and the
people of Israel, to do whatever Thy hand and counsel predestinated to
be done.” <span id="fr_3517"></span>[3518](#fn_3517.md) See what is said:
“As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes.”
Because God’s hand and counsel predestinated such things to be done by
the hostile Jews as were necessary for the gospel, for our sakes. But
what is it that follows? “But as concerning the election, they are
beloved for their fathers’ sakes.” For are those enemies who perished in
their enmity and those of the same people who still perish in their
opposition to Christ,—are those chosen and beloved? Away with the
thought! Who is so utterly foolish as to say this? But both expressions,
although contrary to one another—that is, “enemies” and “beloved”—are
appropriate, though not to the same men, yet to the same Jewish people,
and to the same carnal seed of lsrael, of whom some belonged to the
falling away, and some to the blessing of Israel himself. For the
apostle previously explained this meaning more clearly when he said,
“That which lsrael wrought for, he hath not obtained; but the election
hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded?” <span
id="fr_3518"></span>[3519](#fn_3518.md) Yet in both cases it was the very
same Israel. Where, therefore, we hear, “Israel hath not obtained,” or,
“The rest were blinded,” there are to be understood the enemies for our
sakes; but where we hear, “that the election hath obtained it,” there
are to be understood the beloved for their father’s sakes, to which
fathers those things were assuredly promised; because “the promises were
made to Abraham and his seed,” <span
id="fr_3519"></span>[3520](#fn_3519.md) whence also in that olive-tree is
grafted the wild olive-tree of the Gentiles. Now subsequently we
certainly ought to fall in with the election, of which he says that it
is according to grace, not according to debt, because “there was made a
remnant by the election of grace” <span
id="fr_3520"></span>[3521](#fn_3520.md) This election obtained it, the rest
being blinded. As concerning this election, the Israelites were beloved
for the sake of their fathers. For they were not called with that
calling of which it is said, “Many are called,” but with that whereby
the chosen are called. Whence also after he had said, “But as concerning
the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes,” he went on to
add those words whence this discussion arose: “For the gifts and calling
of God are without repentance,”—that is, they are firmly established
without change. Those who belong to this calling are all teachable by
God; nor can any of them say, “I believed in order to being thus
called,” because the mercy of God anticipated him, because he was so
called in order that he might believe. For all who are teachable of God
come to the Son because they have heard and learned from the Father
through the Son, who most clearly says, “Every one who has heard of the
Father, and has learned, cometh unto me.” <span
id="fr_3521"></span>[3522](#fn_3521.md) But of such as these none perishes,
because “of all that the Father hath given Him, He will lose
none.” <span id="fr_3522"></span>[3523](#fn_3522.md) Whoever, therefore, is
of these does not perish at all; nor was any who perishes ever of these.
For which reason it is said, “They went out from among us, but they were
not of us; for if they had been of us, they would certainly have
continued with us.” <span id="fr_3523"></span>[3524](#fn_3523.md)
