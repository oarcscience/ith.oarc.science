<span id="xiv.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—The Eleventh Item of the
Accusation.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxvi-p2"></span>But what comes afterwards again fills me
with anxiety. On its being objected to him, from the fifth chapter of
Cœlestius’ book, that “they say that every individual has the ability to
possess all powers and graces, thus taking away that ‘diversity of
graces,’ which the apostle teaches,” Pelagius replied: “We have
certainly said so much; but yet they have laid against us a malignant
and blundering charge. We do not take away the diversity of graces; but
we declare that God gives to the person, who has proved himself worthy
to receive them, all graces, even as He conferred them on the Apostle
Paul.” Hereupon the Synod said: “You accordingly do yourself hold the
doctrine of the Church touching the gift of the graces, which are
collectively possessed by the apostle.” Here some one may say, “Why then
is he anxious? Do you on your side deny that all the powers and graces
were combined in the apostle?” For my own part, indeed, if all those are
to be understood which the apostle has himself mentioned together in one
passage,—as, I suppose, the bishops understood Pelagius to mean when
they approved of his answer, and pronounced it to be in keeping with the
sense of the Church,—then I do not doubt that the apostle had them all;
for he says: “And God hath set some in the Church, first, apostles;
secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers; after that miracles; then
gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.” <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md) What then? shall we say that the
Apostle Paul did not possess all these gifts himself? Who would be bold
enough to assert this? The very fact that he was an apostle showed, of
course, that he possessed the grace of the *apostolate*. He possessed
also that of *prophecy*; for was not that a prophecy of his in which he
says: “In the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed
to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils?” <span
id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696.md) He was, moreover, “the *teacher* of
the Gentiles in faith and verity.” <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697.md) He performed *miracles* also and
cures; for he shook off from his hand, unhurt, the biting viper; <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698.md) and the cripple stood upright on
his feet at the apostle’s word, and his strength was at once
restored. <span id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699.md) It is not clear
what he means by *helps*, for the term is of very wide application; but
who can say that he was wanting even in this grace, when through his
labours such helps were manifestly afforded towards the salvation of
mankind? Then as to his possessing the grace of “*government*,” what
could be more excellent than his administration, when the Lord at that
time governed so many churches by his personal agency, and governs them
still in our day through his epistles? And in respect of the
“*diversities of tongues*,” what tongues could have been wanting to him,
when he says himself: “I thank my God that I speak with tongues more
than you all?” <span id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700.md) <span
id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span id="xiv.xxxvi-Page_198"></span>It
being thus inevitable to suppose that not one of these was wanting to
the Apostle Paul, the judges approved of Pelagius’ answer, wherein he
said “that all graces were conferred upon him.” But there are other
graces in addition to these which are not mentioned here. For it is not
to be supposed, however greatly the Apostle Paul excelled others as a
member of Christ’s body, that the very Head itself of the entire body
did not receive more and ampler graces still, whether in His flesh or
His soul as man; for such a created nature did the Word of God assume as
His own into the unity of His Person, that He might be our Head, and we
His body. And in very deed, if all gifts could be in each member, it
would be evident that the similitude, which is used to illustrate this
subject, of the several members of our body is inapplicable; for some
things are common to the members in general, such as life and health,
whilst other things are peculiar to the separate members, since the ear
has no perception of colours, nor the eye of voices. Hence it is
written: “If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? if the
whole were hearing, where were the smelling?” <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701.md) Now this of course is not said as
if it were impossible for God to impart to the ear the sense of seeing,
or to the eye the function of hearing. However, what He does in Christ’s
body, which is the Church, and what the apostle meant by diversity of
graces <span id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702.md) as if through the
different members, there might be gifts proper even to every one
separately, is clearly known. Why, too, and on what ground they who
raised the objection were so unwilling to have taken away all difference
in graces, why, moreover, the bishops of the synod were able to approve
of the answer given by Pelagius in deference to the Apostle Paul, in
whom we admit the combination of all those graces which he mentioned in
the one particular passage, is by this time clear also.
