id="xviii.vi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—The Craft of the
Pelagians.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xix-p2"></span>And if these things be so, let the
Pelagians cease by their most insidious praises of these five
things—that is, the praise of the creature, the praise of marriage, the
praise of the law, the praise of free will, the praise of the
saints—from feigning that they desire to pluck men, as it were, from the
little snares of the Manicheans, in order that they may entangle them in
their own nets—that is, that they may deny original sin; may begrudge to
infants the aid of Christ the physician; may say that the grace of God
is given according to our merits, and thus that grace is no more grace;
and may say that the saints in this life had not sin, and thus make the
prayer of none effect which He gave to the saints who had no sin, and by
which all sin is pardoned to the saints that pray unto Him. To these
three evil doctrines, they by their deceitful praise of these five good
things seduce careless and unlearned men. Concerning all which things, I
think I have sufficiently censured their most cruel and wicked and proud
vanity.
