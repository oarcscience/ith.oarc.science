<span id="xvii.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Disobedient Compassion and
Compassionate Disobedience Reprobated. Martyrdom in Lieu of
Baptism.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.xvii-p2"></span>The new-fangled Pelagian heretics have
been most justly condemned by the authority of catholic councils and of
the Apostolic See, on the ground of their having dared to give to
unbaptized infants a place of rest and salvation, even apart from the
kingdom of heaven. This they would not have dared to do, if they did not
deny their having original sin, and the need of its remission by the
sacrament of baptism. This man, however, professes the catholic belief
on this point, admitting that infants are tied in the bonds of original
sin, and yet he releases them from these bonds without the laver of
regeneration, and after death, in his compassion, he admits them into
paradise; while, with a still ampler compassion, he introduces them
after the resurrection even to the kingdom of heaven. Such compassion
did Saul see fit to assume when he spared the king whom God commanded to
be slain; <span id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419) deservedly,
however, was his disobedient compassion, or (if you prefer it) his
compassionate disobedience, reprobated and condemned, that man may be on
his guard against extending mercy to his fellow-man, in opposition to
the sentence of Him by whom man was made. Truth, by the mouth of Itself
incarnate, proclaims as if in a voice of thunder: “Except a man be born
again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.” <span id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420) And in order to except
martyrs from this sentence, to whose lot it has fallen to be slain for
the name of Christ before being washed in the baptism of Christ, He says
in another passage, “He that loseth his life for my sake shall find
it.” <span id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421) And so far from
promising the abolition of original sin to any one who has not been
regenerated in the laver of Christian faith, the apostle exclaims, “By
the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation.” <span
id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422) And as a counterbalance against
this condemnation, the Lord exhibits the help of His salvation alone,
saying, “He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that
believeth not shall be damned.” <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423) Now the mystery of this believing
in the case of infants is completely effected by the response of the
sureties by whom they are taken to baptism; and unless this be effected,
they all pass by the offence of one into condemnation. And yet, in
opposition to such clear declarations uttered by the Truth, forth
marches before all men a vanity which is more foolish than pitiful, and
says: Not only do infants not pass into condemnation, though no laver of
Christian faith absolves them from the chain of original sin, but they
even after death have an intermediate enjoyment of the felicities of
paradise, and after the resurrection they shall possess even the
happiness of the kingdom of heaven. Now, would this man dare to say all
this in opposition to the firmly-established catholic faith, if he had
not presumptuously undertaken to solve a question which transcends his
powers touching the origin of the soul?
