<span id="xviii.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[VIII.\]—The Fifth
Calumny,—That It is Said that Paul and the Rest of the Apostles Were
Polluted by Lust.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xiii-p2"></span>He says, “They say that even the
Apostle Paul, even all the apostles, were always polluted by immoderate
lust.” What man, however profane he may be, would dare to say this? But
doubtless this man thus misrepresents because they contend that what the
apostle said, “I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good
thing, for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is
good I find not,” <span id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555.md) and other
such things, he said not of himself, but that he introduced the person
of somebody else, I know not who, who was suffering these things.
Wherefore that passage in his epistle must be carefully considered and
investigated, that their error may not lurk in any obscurity of his.
Although, therefore, the apostle is here arguing broadly, and with great
and lasting conflict maintaining grace against those who were boasting
in the law, yet we do come upon a few matters which pertain to the
matter in hand. On which subject he says: “Because by the law there
shall no flesh be justified in His sight. For by the law is the
knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is
manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the
righteousness of God by the faith of Jesus Christ unto all them that
believe. For there is no difference. For all have sinned and come short
of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556.md) And again: “Where is boasting? It
is excluded. By what law? Of works? No; but by the law of faith.
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works
of the law.” <span id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557.md) And again: “For
the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham
or to his seed through the law, but by the righteousness of faith. For
if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the
promise made of none effect. Because the law worketh wrath, for where no
law is, there is no transgression.” <span
id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558.md) And in another place: “Moreover,
the law entered that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded
grace did much more abound.” <span id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559.md)
In still another place: “For sin shall not have dominion over you, for
ye are not under law, but under grace.” <span
id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560.md) And again in another place: “Know
ye not, brethren (for I speak to them that know the law), that the law
hath dominion over a man so long as he liveth? For the woman which is
under a husband is joined to her husband by the law so long as he
liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her
husband.” <span id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561.md) And a little after:
“Therefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body
of Christ, that ye should belong to another, who has risen from the dead
that we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh
the passions of sins which are by the law did work in our members to
bring forth fruit unto death, but now we are delivered from the law of
death in which we were held, so that we may serve in newness of spirit,
and not in the oldness of the letter.” <span
id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562.md) With these and such like
testimonies that teacher of the Gentiles showed with sufficient evidence
that the law could not take away sin, but rather increased it, and that
grace takes it away; since the law knew how to command, to which command
weakness gives way, while grace knows to assist, whereby love is
infused. <span id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563.md) And lest any one, on
account of these testimonies, should reproach the law, and contend that
it is evil, the apostle, seeing what might occur to those who ill
understand it, himself proposed to himself the same question. “What
shall we say, then?” said he. “Is the law sin? Far from it. But I did
not know sin except by the law.” <span
id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564.md) He had <span id="page_382">p.
382</span> <span id="xviii.iii.xiii-Page_382"></span>already said
before, “For by the law is the knowledge of sin.” It is not, therefore,
the taking away, but the knowledge of sin.
