<span id="xviii.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Death Passed Upon All by
Sin.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.viii-p2"></span>But on account of what does the same
apostle say, that we are reconciled to God by Christ, except on account
of what we had become enemies? And what is this but sin? Whence also the
prophet says, “Your sins separate between you and God.” <span
id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786.md) On account of this separation,
therefore, the Mediator was sent, that He might take away the sin of the
world, by which we were separated as enemies, and that we, being
reconciled, might be made from enemies children. About this, certainly,
the apostle was speaking; hence it happened that he interposed what he
says, “That sin entered by one man.” For these are his former words. He
says, “But God commendeth His love towards us in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified in His
blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if, when we were
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more,
being reconciled, we shall be saved in His life. And not only so, but
glorying also in God through Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom also we have
now received reconciliation.” Then he subjoins, “Therefore, as by one
man sin entered into this world, and death by sin, and so passed upon
all men, for in him all have sinned.” <span
id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787.md) Why do the Pelagians evade this
matter? If reconciliation through Christ is necessary to all men, on all
men has passed sin by which we have become enemies, in order that we
should have need of reconciliation. This reconciliation is in the laver
of regeneration and in the flesh and blood of Christ, without which not
even infants can have life in themselves. For as there was one man for
death on account of sin, so there is one man for life on account of
righteousness; because “as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all
be made alive;” <span id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788.md) and “as by
the sin of one upon all men to condemnation, so also by the
righteousness of one upon all men unto justification of life.” <span
id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789.md) Who is there that has turned a deaf
ear to these apostolical words with such hardiness of wicked impiety,
as, having heard them, to contend that death passed upon us through Adam
without sin, unless, indeed, they are opposers of the grace of God and
enemies of the cross of Christ?—whose end is destruction if they
continue in this obstinacy. But let it suffice to have said thus much
for the sake of that serpentine subtlety of theirs, by which they wish
to corrupt simple minds, and to turn them away from the simplicity of
the faith, as if by the praise of the creature.
