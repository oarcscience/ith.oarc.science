<span id="xx.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45.—Scriptural Instances Wherein It
is Proved that God Has Men’s Wills More in His Power Than They
Themselves Have.</span>

<span id="xx.xlviii-p2"></span>It is not, then, to be doubted that men’s
wills cannot, so as to prevent His doing what he wills, withstand the
will of God, “who hath done all things whatsoever He pleased in heaven
and in earth,” <span id="fr_3392"></span>[3393](#fn_3392.md) and who also
“has done those things that are to come;” <span
id="fr_3393"></span>[3394](#fn_3393.md) since He does even concerning the
wills themselves of men what He will, when He will. Unless, perchance
(to mention some things among many), when God willed to give the kingdom
to Saul, it was so in the power of the Israelites, as it certainly was
placed in their will, either to subject themselves or not to the man in
question, that they could even prevail to withstand God. God, however,
did not do this, save by the will of the men themselves, because he
beyond doubt had the most omnipotent power of inclining men’s hearts
whither it pleased Him. For thus it is written: “And Samuel sent the
people away, and every one went away unto his own place. And Saul went
away to his house in Gibeah: and there went away <span id="page_490">p.
490</span> <span id="xx.xlviii-Page_490"></span>with Saul mighty men,
whose hearts the Lord touched. And pestilent children said, Who shall
save us? This man? And they despised him, and brought him no
presents.” <span id="fr_3394"></span>[3395](#fn_3394.md) Will any one say
that any of those whose hearts the Lord touched to go with Saul would
not have gone with him, or that any of those pestilent fellows, whose
hearts He did not touch to do this, would have gone? Of David also, whom
the Lord ordained to the kingdom in a more prosperous succession, we
read thus: “And David continued to increase, and was magnified, and the
Lord was with him.” <span id="fr_3395"></span>[3396](#fn_3395.md) This
having been premised, it is said a little afterwards, “And the Spirit
clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said, We are thine, O David,
and we will be with thee, O son of Jesse: Peace, peace be unto thee, and
peace be to thy helpers; because the Lord has helped thee.” <span
id="fr_3396"></span>[3397](#fn_3396.md) Could he withstand the will of God,
and not rather do the will of Him who wrought in his heart by His
Spirit, with which he was clothed, to will, speak, and do thus?
Moreover, a little afterwards the same Scripture says, “All these
warlike men, setting the battle in array, came with a peaceful heart to
Hebron to establish David over all Israel.” <span
id="fr_3397"></span>[3398](#fn_3397.md) By their own will, certainly, they
appointed David king. Who cannot see this? Who can deny it? For they did
not do it under constraint or without good-will, since they did it with
a peaceful heart. And yet He wrought this in them who worketh what He
will in the hearts of men. For which reason the Scripture premised, “And
David continued to increase, and was magnified, and the Lord Omnipotent
was with him.” And thus the Lord Omnipotent, who was with him, induced
these men to appoint him king. And how did He induce them? Did He
constrain thereto by any bodily fetters? He wrought within; He held
their hearts; He stirred their hearts, and drew them by their own wills,
which He Himself wrought in them. If, then, when God wills to set up
kings in the earth, He has the wills of men more in His power than they
themselves have, who else causes rebuke to be wholesome and correction
to result in the heart of him that is rebuked, that he may be
established in the kingdom of heaven?
