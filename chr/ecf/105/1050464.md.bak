<span id="xv.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[VIII.\]—The Law One Thing, Grace
Another. The Utility of the Law.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.ix-p2"></span>Hence, then, it is clear that he
acknowledges that grace whereby God points out and reveals to us what we
are bound to do; but not that whereby He endows and assists us to act,
since the knowledge of the law, unless it be accompanied by the
assistance of grace, rather avails for producing the transgression of
the commandment. “Where there is no law,” says the apostle, “there is no
transgression;” <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792.md) and again: “I
had not known lust except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.” <span
id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md) Therefore so far are the law and
grace from being the same thing, that the law is not only unprofitable,
but it is absolutely prejudicial, unless grace assists it; and the
utility of the law may be shown by this, that it obliges all whom it
proves guilty of transgression to betake themselves to grace for
deliverance and help to overcome their evil lusts. <span
id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span id="xv.iii.ix-Page_220"></span>For it
rather commands than assists; it discovers disease, but does not heal
it; nay, the malady that is not healed is rather aggravated by it, so
that the cure of grace is more earnestly and anxiously sought for,
inasmuch as “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.” <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) “For if there had been a law given
which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by
the law.” <span id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) To what extent,
however, the law gives assistance, the apostle informs us when he says
immediately afterwards: “The Scripture hath concluded all under sin,
that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
believe.” <span id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md) Wherefore, says the
apostle, “the law was our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797.md) Now this very thing is serviceable
to proud men, to be more firmly and manifestly “concluded under sin,” so
that none may pre-sumptuously endeavour to accomplish their
justification by means of free will as if by their own resources; but
rather “that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
guilty before God. Because by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh
be justified in His sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But
now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being
witnessed by the law and the prophets.” <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) How then manifested without the
law, if witnessed by the law? For this very reason the phrase is not,
“manifested without the law,” but “the righteousness without the law,”
because it is “the righteousness of God;” that is, the righteousness
which we have not from the law, but from God,—not the righteousness,
indeed, which by reason of His commanding it, causes us fear through our
knowledge of it; but rather the righteousness which by reason of His
bestowing it, is held fast and maintained by us through our loving
it,—“so that he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.” <span
