id="xv.iii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XXXVI\]—A Letter of Pelagius
Unknown to Augustin.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxxix-p2"></span>“Let them also read,” says he, “my
epistle to the holy Bishop Constantius, wherein I have—briefly no doubt,
but yet plainly—conjoined the grace and help of God with man’s free
will.” This epistle, as I have already stated, <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) I have not read; but if it is not
unlike the other writings which he mentions, and with which I am
acquainted, even this work does nothing for the subject of our present
inquiry.
