<span id="xix.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Entering into Temptation. Prayer
is a Proof of Grace.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.ix-p2"></span>Wherefore, our Heavenly Master also says:
“Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.” <span
id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007) Let every man, therefore, when
fighting against his own concupiscence, pray that he enter not into
temptation; that is, that he be not drawn aside and enticed by it. But
he does not enter into temptation if he conquers his evil concupiscence
by good will. And yet the determination of the human will is
insufficient, unless the Lord grant it victory in answer to prayer that
it enter not into temptation. What, indeed, affords clearer evidence of
the grace of God than the acceptance of prayer in any petition? If our
Saviour had only said, “Watch that ye enter not into temptation,” He
would appear to have done nothing further than admonish man’s will; but
since He added the words, “and pray,” He showed that God helps us not to
enter into temptation. It is to the free will of man that the words are
addressed: “My son, remove not thyself from the chastening of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008) And the Lord said: “I
have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy faith fail not.” <span
id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009) So that a man is assisted by grace,
in order that his will may not be uselessly commanded.
