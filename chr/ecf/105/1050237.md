id="xi.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 61 \[XXXV.\]—Conclusion of the
Work.</span>

<span id="xi.lxiv-p2"></span>Let us at last bring our book to an end. I
hardly know whether we have accomplished our purpose at all by our great
prolixity. It is not in respect of you, \[my Marcellinus,\] that I have
this misgiving, for I know your faith; but with reference to the minds
of those for whose sake you wished me to write,—who so much in
opposition to my opinion, but (to speak mildly, and not to mention Him
who spoke in His apostles) certainly against not only the opinion of the
great Apostle Paul, but also his strong, earnest, and vigilant conflict,
prefer maintaining their own views with tenacity to listening to him,
when he “beseeches them by the mercies of God,” and tells them, “through
the grace of God which was given to him, not to think of themselves more
highly than they ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God
had dealt to every man the measure of faith.” <span
