<span id="xxi.ii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—It is to Be Wondered at that Men
Should Rather Trust to Their Own Weakness Than to God’s Strength.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxi-p2"></span>Certainly, when the apostle says,
“Therefore it is of faith that the promise may be sure according to
grace,” <span id="fr_3492"></span>[3493](#fn_3492.md) I marvel that men
would rather entrust themselves to their own weakness, than to the
strength of God’s promise. But sayest thou, God’s will concerning myself
is to me uncertain? What then? Is thine own will concerning thyself
certain to thee? and dost thou not fear,—“Let him that thinketh he
standeth take heed lest he fall”? <span
id="fr_3493"></span>[3494](#fn_3493.md) Since, then, both are uncertain,
why does not man commit his faith, hope, and love to the stronger will
rather than to the weaker?
