<span id="xviii.v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—In What Sense the Righteousness
of Man in This Life is Said to Be Perfect.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xix-p2"></span>From this it results that the virtue
which is now in the righteous man is named perfect up to this point,
that to its perfection belong both the true knowledge and humble
confession of even imperfection itself. For, in respect to this
infirmity, that little righteousness of man’s is perfect according to
its measure, when it understands even what it lacks. And therefore the
apostle calls himself both perfect and imperfect, <span
id="fr_2748"></span>[2749](#fn_2748.md) —imperfect, to wit, in the thought
of how much is wanting to him for the righteousness for the fulness of
which he is still hungering and thirsting; but perfect in that he does
not blush to confess his own imperfection, and goes forward in good that
he may attain. As we can say that the wayfarer is perfect whose approach
is well forwarded, although his intention is not carried out unless his
arrival be actually effected. Therefore, when he had said, “According to
the righteousness which is in the law, I am one who has been without
blame,” he immediately added, “What things were gain to me, those I
counted but loss for Christ’s sake. Yea, doubtless, and I count all
things to be loss for the sake of the eminent knowledge of Christ Jesus
our Lord: for whose sake I have believed all things not only to be
losses, but I have thought them to be even as dung, that I might gain
Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of
the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ, the righteousness
which is of God in faith.” <span id="fr_2749"></span>[2750](#fn_2749.md)
See! the apostle does not, of course, say falsely, that “according to
the righteousness which is of the law he was without blame;” and yet
those things which were gain to him, he casts away for Christ’s sake,
and thinks them losses, injuries, dung. And not only these things, but
all other things which he mentioned previously; not on account of any
kind of knowledge, but, as he himself says, “the eminent knowledge of
Christ Jesus our Lord,” which, beyond a doubt, he had as yet in faith,
but not yet in sight. For then the knowledge of Christ will be eminent,
when He shall be so revealed that what is believed is seen. Whence, in
another place, he thus says, “For ye have died, and your life is hidden
with Christ in God. When Christ, your life, shall appear, then shall ye
also appear with Him in glory.” <span
id="fr_2750"></span>[2751](#fn_2750.md) Hence, also, the Lord Himself says,
“He who loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and
will manifest myself to him.” <span id="fr_2751"></span>[2752](#fn_2751.md)
Hence John the Evangelist says, “Beloved, now are we the sons of God,
and it has not yet appeared what we shall be: but we know, that when He
shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He
is.” <span id="fr_2752"></span>[2753](#fn_2752.md) Then shall the knowledge
of Christ be eminent. For now it is, as it were, hidden away in faith;
but it does not yet appear eminent in sight.
