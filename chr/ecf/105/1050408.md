<span id="xiv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XI.\]—The Seventh Item of the
Accusation: the Breviates of Cœlestius Objected to Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxvii-p2"></span>Then follow sundry statements charged
against Pelagius, which are said to be found among the opinions of his
disciple Cœlestius: how that “Adam was created mortal, and would have
died whether he had sinned or not sinned; that Adam’s sin injured only
himself and not the human race; that the law no less than the gospel
leads us to the kingdom; that there were sinless men previous to the
coming of Christ; that new-born infants are in the same condition as
Adam was before the fall; that the whole human race does not, on the one
hand, die through Adam’s death or transgression, nor, on the other hand,
does the whole human race rise again through the resurrection of
Christ.” These have been so objected to, that they are even said to have
been, after a full hearing, condemned at Carthage by your holiness and
other bishops associated with you. <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675) I was not present on that occasion,
as you will recollect; but afterwards, on my arrival at Carthage, I read
over the Acts of the synod, some of which I perfectly well remember, but
I do not know whether all the tenets now mentioned occur among them. But
what matters it if some of them were possibly not mentioned, and so not
included in the condemnation of the synod when it is quite clear that
they deserve condemnation? Sundry other points of error were next
alleged against him, connected with the mention of my own name. <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676) They had been transmitted to me
from Sicily, some of our Catholic brethren there being perplexed by
questions of this kind; and I drew up a reply to them in a little work
addressed to Hilary, <span id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677) who had
consulted me respecting them in a letter. My answer, in my opinion, was
a sufficient one. These are the errors referred to: “That a man is able
to be without sin if he wishes. That infants, even if they die
unbaptized, have eternal life. That rich men, even if they are baptized,
unless they renounce all, have, whatever good they may seem to have
done, nothing of it reckoned to them; neither can they possess the
kingdom of God.”
