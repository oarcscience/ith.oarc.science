Accusation; And Pelagius’ Answer.</span>

<span id="xiv.xvii-p2"></span>After the judges had accorded their
approbation to this answer of Pelagius, another passage which he had
written in his book was read aloud: “The kingdom of heaven was promised
even in the Old Testament.” Upon this, Pelagius remarked in vindication:
“This can be proved by the Scriptures: but heretics, in order to
disparage the Old Testament, deny this. I, however, simply followed the
authority of the Scriptures when I said this; for in the prophet Daniel
it is written: ‘The saints shall receive the kingdom of the Most.
High.’” <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) After they had heard
this answer, the synod said: “Neither is this opposed to the Church’s
faith.”
