<span id="xi.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[XIII.\]—The Law of Works and the
Law of Faith.</span>

<span id="xi.xxiv-p2"></span>The law, then, of deeds, that is, the law
of works, whereby this boasting is not excluded, and the law of faith,
by which it is excluded, differ from each other; and this difference it
is worth our while to consider, if so be we are able to observe and
discern it. Hastily, indeed, one might say that the law of works lay in
Judaism, and the law of faith in Christianity; forasmuch as circumcision
and the other works prescribed by the law are just those which the
Christian system no longer retains. But there is a fallacy <span
id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span id="xi.xxiv-Page_92"></span>in this
distinction, the greatness of which I have for some time been
endeavoring to expose; and to such as are acute in appreciating
distinctions, especially to yourself and those like you, I have possibly
succeeded in my effort. Since, however, the subject is an important one,
it will not be unsuitable, if with a view to its illustration, we linger
over the many testimonies which again and again meet our view. Now, the
apostle says that that law by which no man is justified, <span
id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794) entered in that the offence might
abound, <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795) and yet in order to save
it from the aspersions of the ignorant and the accusations of the
impious, he defends this very law in such words as these: “What shall we
say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin but by
the law: for I had not known concupiscence, except the law had said,
Thou shall not covet. But sin, taking occasion, wrought, by the
commandment, in me all manner of concupiscence.” <span
id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796) He says also: “The law indeed is holy,
and the commandment is holy, and just, and good; but sin, that it might
appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good.” <span
id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) It is therefore the very letter that
kills which says, “Thou shalt not covet,” and it is of this that he
speaks in a passage which I have before referred to: “By the law is the
knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is
manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the
righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ upon all them
that believe; for there is no difference: seeing that all have sinned,
and come short of the glory of God: being justified freely by His grace,
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath set forth
to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His
righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
forbearance of God; to declare His righteousness at this time; that He
might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798) And then he adds the passage which is
now under consideration: “Where, then, is your boasting? It is excluded.
By what law? of works? Nay; but by the law of faith.” <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799) And so it is the very law of works
itself which says, “Thou shalt not covet;” because thereby comes the
knowledge of sin. Now I wish to know, if anybody will dare to tell me,
whether the law of faith does not say to us, “Thou shalt not covet”? For
if it does not say so to us, what reason is there why we, who are placed
under it, should not sin in safety and with impunity? Indeed, this is
just what those people thought the apostle meant, of whom he writes:
“Even as some affirm that we say, Let us do evil, that good may come;
whose damnation is just.” <span id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800) If, on
the contrary, it too says to us, “Thou shall not covet” (even as
numerous passages in the gospels and epistles so often testify and
urge), then why is not this law also called the law of works? For it by
no means follows that, because it retains not the “works” of the ancient
sacraments,—even circumcision and the other ceremonies,—it therefore has
no “works” in its own sacraments, which are adapted to the present age;
unless, indeed, the question was about sacramental works, when mention
was made of the law, just because by it is the knowledge of sin, and
therefore nobody is justified by it, so that it is not by it that
boasting is excluded, but by the law of faith, whereby the just man
lives. But is there not by it too the knowledge of sin, when even it
says, “Thou shall not covet?”
