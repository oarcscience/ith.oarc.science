id="xix.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Sinners are Convicted When
Attempting to Excuse Themselves by Blaming God, Because They Have Free
Will.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.iii-p2"></span>There are, however, persons who attempt
to find excuse for themselves even from God. The Apostle James says to
such: “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God
cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth He any man. But every man
is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then,
when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is
finished, bringeth forth death.” <span
id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md) Solomon, too, in his book of
Proverbs, has this answer for such as wish to find an excuse for
themselves from God Himself: “The folly of a man spoils his ways; but he
blames God in his heart.” <span id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md) And
in the book of Ecclesiasticus we read: “Say not thou, It is through the
Lord that I fell away; for thou oughtest not to do the things that He
hateth: nor do thou say, He hath caused me to err; for He hath no need
of the sinful man. The Lord hateth all abomination, and they that fear
God love it not. He Himself made man from the beginning, and left him in
the hand of His counsel. If thou be willing, thou shalt keep His
commandments, and perform true fidelity. He hath set fire and water
before thee: stretch forth thine hand unto whether thou wilt. Before man
is life and death, and whichsoever pleaseth him shall be given to
him.” <span id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957.md) Observe how very
plainly is set before our view the free choice of the human will.
