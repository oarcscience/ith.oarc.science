<span id="xii.lxxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 79 \[LXVI.\]—A Certain Necessity of
Sinning.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxxiii-p2"></span>But let us revert to the apostle’s
assertion: “The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
Ghost which is given unto us.” <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) By whom given if not by Him who
“ascended up on high, led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto
men?” <span id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) Forasmuch, however, as
there is, owing to the defects that have entered our nature, not to the
constitution of our nature, a certain necessary tendency to sin, a man
should listen, and in order that the said necessity may cease to exist,
learn to say to God, “Bring Thou me out of my necessities;” <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) because in the very offering up of
such a prayer there is a struggle against the tempter, who fights
against us concerning this very necessity; and thus, by the assistance
of grace through our Lord Jesus Christ, both the evil necessity will be
removed and full liberty be bestowed.
