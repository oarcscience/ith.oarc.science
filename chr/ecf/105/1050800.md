id="xviii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Introduction: Address to
Boniface.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xviii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>I Had</span> indeed known you by the praise
of your renowned fame; and by very numerous and veracious messengers I
had learned how full you were of the grace of God, most blessed and
venerable Pope Boniface! But after my brother Alypius saw you even in
bodily presence; and, having been received by you with all kindness and
sincerity, held, at the bidding of affection, conversations with you;
and living with you, and, although only for a short time, united with
you in earnest affection, poured out to your mind both himself and me;
and brought you back to me in his mind:—the more assured was your
friendship, the greater became in me the conviction of your holiness.
For you, who mind not high things, however loftily you are placed, did
not disdain to be a friend of the lowly and to return the love bestowed
upon you. For what else is friendship which has its name from no other
source than love, <span id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526) and is
nowhere faithful but in Christ, in whom alone it can be eternal and
happy? Whence, also, having received a greater assurance by means of
that brother, through whom I have learned to know you more familiarly, I
have ventured to write something to your blessedness concerning those
things which at this juncture are claiming by a later stimulus the
episcopal care, as far as we are able, to vigilance on behalf of the
Lord’s flock.
