<span id="xi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15 \[IX.\]—The Righteousness of God
Manifested by the Law and the Prophets.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii-p2"></span>Here, perhaps, it may be said by that
presumption of man, which is ignorant of the righteousness of God, and
wishes to establish one of its own, that the apostle quite properly
said, “For by the law shall no man be justified,” <span
id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) inasmuch as the law merely shows what
one ought to do, and what one ought to guard against, in order that what
the law thus points out may be accomplished by the will, and so man be
justified, not indeed by the power of the law, but by his free
determination. But I ask your attention, O man, to what follows. “But
now the righteousness of God,” says he, “without the law is manifested,
being witnessed by the law and the prophets.” <span
id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) Does this then sound a light thing in
deaf ears? He says, “The righteousness of God is manifested.” Now this
righteousness they are ignorant of, who wish to establish one of their
own; they will not submit themselves to it. <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) His words are, “*The righteousness of
God* <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="xi.xviii-Page_89"></span>is manifested:” he does not say, the
righteousness of man, or the righteousness of his own will, but the
“righteousness *of God*,”—not that whereby He is Himself righteous, but
that with which He endows man when He justifies the ungodly. This is
witnessed by the law and the prophets; in other words, the law and the
prophets each afford it testimony. The law, indeed, by issuing its
commands and threats, and by justifying no man, sufficiently shows that
it is by God’s gift, through the help of the Spirit, that a man is
justified; and the prophets, because it was what they predicted that
Christ at His coming accomplished. Accordingly he advances a step
further, and adds, “But righteousness of God by faith of Jesus
Christ,” <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) that is by the faith
wherewith one believes in Christ for just as there is not meant the
faith with which Christ Himself believes, so also there is not meant the
righteousness whereby God is Himself righteous. Both no doubt are ours,
but yet they are called God’s, and Christ’s, because it is by their
bounty that these gifts are bestowed upon us. The righteousness of God
then is without the law, but not manifested without the law; for if it
were manifested without the law, how could it be witnessed by the law?
That righteousness of God, however, is without the law, which God by the
Spirit of grace bestows on the believer without the help of the
law,—that is, when not helped by the law. When, indeed, He by the law
discovers to a man his weakness, it is in order that by faith he may
flee for refuge to His mercy, and be healed. And thus concerning His
wisdom we are told, that “she carries law and mercy upon her
tongue,” <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) —the “*law*,” whereby
she may convict the proud, the “*mercy*,” wherewith she may justify the
humbled. “The righteousness of God,” then, “by faith of Jesus Christ, is
unto all that believe; for there is no difference, for all have sinned,
and come short of the glory of God” <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) —not of their own glory. For what have
they, which they have not received? Now if they received it, why do they
glory as if they had not received it? <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) Well, then, they come short of the
glory of God; now observe what follows: “Being justified freely by His
grace.” <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) It is not, therefore, by
the law, nor is it by their own will, that they are justified; but they
are justified *freely by His grace*,—not that it is wrought without our
will; but our will is by the law shown to be weak, that grace may heal
its infirmity; and that our healed will may fulfil the law, not by
compact under the law, nor yet in the absence of law.
