<span id="x.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14. —Job Was Not Without Sin.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xiv-p2"></span>But let us see what Job has to say of
himself, after God’s great testimony of his righteousness. “I know of a
truth,” he says, “that it is so: for how shall a mortal man be just
before the Lord? For if He should enter into judgment with him, he would
not be able to obey Him.” <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510) And
shortly afterwards he asks: “Who shall resist His judgment? Even if I
should seem righteous, <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span
id="x.iv.xiv-Page_50"></span>my mouth will speak profanely.” <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511) And again, further on, he says: “I
know He will not leave me unpunished. But since I am ungodly, why have I
not died? If I should wash myself with snow, and be purged with clean
hands, thou hadst thoroughly stained me with filth.” <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512) In another of his discourses he says:
“For Thou hast written evil things against me, and hast compassed me
with the sins of my youth; and Thou hast placed my foot in the stocks.
Thou hast watched all my works, and hast inspected the soles of my feet,
which wax old like a bottle, or like a moth-eaten garment. For man that
is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of wrath;
like a flower that hath bloomed, so doth he fall; he is gone like a
shadow, and continueth not. Hast Thou not taken account even of him, and
caused him to enter into judgment with Thee? For who is pure from
uncleanness? Not even one; even should his life last but a day.” <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513) Then a little afterwards he says:
“Thou hast numbered all my necessities; and not one of my sins hath
escaped Thee. Thou hast sealed up my transgressions in a bag, and hast
marked whatever I have done unwillingly.” <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514) See how Job, too, confesses his sins,
and says how sure he is that there is none righteous before the Lord. So
he is sure of this also, that if we say we have no sin, the truth is not
in us. While, therefore, God bestows on him His high testimony of
righteousness, according to the standard of human conduct, Job himself,
taking his measure from that rule of righteousness, which, as well as he
can, he beholds in God, knows of a truth that so it is; and he goes on
at once to say, “How shall a mortal man be just before the Lord? For if
He should enter into judgment with him, he would not be able to obey
Him;” in other words, if, when challenged to judgment, he wished to show
that nothing could be found in him which He could condemn, “he would not
be able to obey him,” since he misses even that obedience which might
enable him to obey Him who teaches that sins ought to be confessed.
Accordingly \[the Lord\] rebukes certain men, saying, “Why will ye
contend with me in judgment?” <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515)
This \[the Psalmist\] averts, saying, “Enter not into judgment with Thy
servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.” <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516) In accordance with this, Job also
asks: “For who shall resist his judgment? Even if I should seem
righteous, my mouth will speak profanely;” which means: If, contrary to
His judgment, I should call myself righteous, when His perfect rule of
righteousness proves me to be unrighteous, then of a truth my mouth
would speak profanely, because it would speak against the truth of God.
