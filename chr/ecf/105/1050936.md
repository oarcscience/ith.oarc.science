<span id="xix.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—He Proves the Existence of
Free Will in Man from the Precepts Addressed to Him by God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.ii-p2"></span>Now He has revealed to us, through His
Holy Scriptures, that there is in a man a free choice of will. But how
He has revealed this I do not recount in human language, but in divine.
There is, to begin with, the fact that God’s precepts themselves would
be of no use to a man unless he had free choice of will, so that by
performing them he might obtain the promised rewards. For they are given
that no one might be able to plead the excuse of ignorance, as the Lord
says concerning the Jews in the gospel: “If I had not come and spoken
unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for
their sin.” <span id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953) Of what sin does
He speak but of that great one which He foreknew, while speaking thus,
that they would make their own—that is, the death they were going to
inflict upon Him? For they did not have “no sin” before Christ came to
them in the flesh. The apostle also says: “The wrath of God is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold
back the truth in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of
God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them. For the
invisible things of Him are from the creation of the world clearly
seen—being understood by the things that are made—even His eternal power
and Godhead, so that they are inexcusable.” <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954) In what sense does he pronounce
them to be “inexcusable,” except with reference to such excuse as human
pride is apt to allege in such words as, “If I had only known, I would
have done it; did I not fail to do it because I was ignorant of it?” or,
“I would do it if I knew how; but I do not know, therefore I do not do
it”? All such excuse is removed from them when the precept is given
them, or the knowledge is made manifest to them how to avoid sin.
