<span id="xi.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XVI\]—Why the Holy Ghost is Called
the Finger of God.</span>

<span id="xi.xxxi-p2"></span>“Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) Now this Spirit of God, by whose gift
we are justified, whence it comes to pass that we delight not to sin,—in
which is liberty; even as, when we are without this Spirit, we delight
to sin,—in which is slavery, from the works of which we must
abstain;—this Holy Spirit, through whom love is shed abroad in our
hearts, which is the fulfilment of the law, is designated in the gospel
as “the finger of God.” <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) Is it
not because those very tables of the law were written by the finger of
God, that the Spirit of God by whom we are sanctified is also *the
finger of God*, in order that, living by faith, we may do good works
through love? Who is not touched by this congruity, and at the same time
diversity? For as fifty days are reckoned from the celebration of the
Passover (which was ordered by Moses to be offered by slaying the
typical lamb, <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) to signify,
indeed, the future death of the Lord) to the day when Moses received the
law written on the tables of stone by the finger of God, <span
id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) so, in like manner, from the death and
resurrection of Him who was led as a lamb to the slaughter, <span
id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) there were fifty complete days up to
the time when the finger of God—that is, the Holy Spirit—gathered
together in one <span id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) perfect company
those who believed.
