<span id="xv.iii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42 \[XXXVIII.\]—Grace Placed by
Pelagius in the Remission of Sins and the Example of Christ.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xlii-p2"></span>Likewise in another place in this
epistle of his he says: “Now, if even before the law, as we have already
remarked, and long previous to the coming of our Lord and Saviour, some
men are related to have lived righteous and holy lives; how much more
worthy of belief is it that we are capable of doing this since the
illumination of His coming, who have been restored by the grace of
Christ, and born again into a better man? How much better than they, who
lived before the law, ought we to be, who have been reconciled and
cleansed by His blood, and by His example encouraged to the perfection
of righteousness!” <span id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884) Observe
how even here, although in different language, he has made the
assistance of grace to consist in the remission of sins and the example
of Christ. He then completes the passage by adding these words: “Better
than they were even who lived under the law; according to the apostle,
who says, ‘Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
the law, but under grace.’ <span id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885)
Now, inasmuch as we have,” says he, “said enough, as I suppose, on this
point, let us describe a perfect virgin, who shall testify the good at
once of nature and of grace by the holiness of her conduct, evermore
warmed with the virtues of both.” <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886) Now you ought to notice that <span
id="page_231">p. 231</span> <span id="xv.iii.xlii-Page_231"></span>in
these words also he wished to conclude what he was saying in such a way
that we might understand the good of nature to be that which we received
when we were created; but the good of grace to be that which we receive
when we regard and follow the example of Christ,—as if sin were not
permitted to those who were or are under the law, on this account,
because they either had not Christ’s example, or else do not believe in
Him.
