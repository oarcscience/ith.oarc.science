<span id="x.iii.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—From the Epistle to the
Romans.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xliii-p2"></span>Let me now request your attention to
the testimony of the Apostle Paul on this subject. And quotations from
him may of course be made more abundantly, because he wrote more
epistles, and because it fell to him to recommend the grace of God with
especial earnestness, in opposition to those who gloried in their works,
and who, ignorant of God’s righteousness, and wishing to establish their
own, submitted not to the righteousness of God. <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348) In his Epistle to the Romans he
writes: “The righteousness of God is upon all them that believe; for
there is no difference; since all have sinned, and come short of the
glory of God; being justified freely by His grace, through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath set forth as a
propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness
for the remission <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349) of sins that
are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this
time His righteousness; that He might be just, and the justifier of him
which believeth in Jesus.” <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350) Then
in another passage he says: “To him that worketh is the reward not
reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but
believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness. Even as David also describeth <span id="page_32">p.
32</span> <span id="x.iii.xliii-Page_32"></span>the blessedness of the
man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed
are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no sin.” <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351) And then after no long interval he
observes: “Now, it was not written for his sake alone, that it was
imputed to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we
believe on Him that raised up Jesus Christ our Lord from the dead; who
was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our
justification.” <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352) Then a little
after he writes: “For when we were yet without strength, in due time
Christ died for the ungodly.” <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353) In
another passage he says: “We know that the law is spiritual; but I am
carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do I know not: for what I
would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do. If then I do that
which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. Now then, it
is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in
me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing; for to will is present
with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good
that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now if
I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
in me. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: but I see
another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and
bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354) Let them, who can, say that men are
not born in the body of this death, that so they may be able to affirm
that they have no need of God’s grace through Jesus Christ in order to
be delivered from the body of this death. Therefore he adds, a few
verses afterwards: “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak
through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful
flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.” <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355) Let them say, who dare, that Christ
must have been born in the likeness of sinful flesh, if we were not born
in sinful flesh.
