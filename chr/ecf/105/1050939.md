<span id="xix.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—He Shows that Ignorance Affords No
Such Excuse as Shall Free the Offender from Punishment; But that to Sin
with Knowledge is a Graver Thing Than to Sin in Ignorance.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.v-p2"></span>The excuse such as men are in the habit of
alleging from ignorance is taken away from those persons who know God’s
commandments. But neither will those be without punishment who know not
the law of God. “For as many as have sinned without law shall also
perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
judged by the law.” <span id="fr_2986"></span>[2987](#fn_2986.md) Now the
apostle does not appear to me to have said this as if he meant that they
would have to suffer something worse who in their sins are ignorant of
the law than they who know it. \[III.\] It is seemingly worse, no doubt,
“to perish” than “to be judged;” but inasmuch as he was speaking of the
Gentiles and of the Jews when he used these words, because the former
were without the law, but the latter had received the law, who can
venture to say that the Jews who sin in the law will not perish, since
they refused to believe in Christ, when it was of them that the apostle
said, “They shall be judged by the law”? For without faith in Christ no
man can be delivered; and therefore they will be so judged that they
perish. If, indeed, the condition of those who are ignorant of the law
of God is worse than the condition of those who know it, how can that be
true which the Lord says in the gospel: “The servant who knows not his
lord’s will, and commits things worthy of <span id="page_446">p.
446</span> <span id="xix.iv.v-Page_446"></span>stripes, shall be beaten
with few stripes; whereas the servant who knows his lord’s will, and
commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with many
stripes”? <span id="fr_2987"></span>[2988](#fn_2987.md) Observe how clearly
He here shows that it is a graver matter for a man to sin with knowledge
than in ignorance. And yet we must not on this account betake ourselves
for refuge to the shades of ignorance, with the view of finding our
excuse therein. It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be
unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of
whom it is said, “He is not inclined to understand, so as to do
good.” <span id="fr_2988"></span>[2989](#fn_2988.md) But even the
ignorance, which is not theirs who refuse to know, but theirs who are,
as it were, simply ignorant, does not so far excuse any one as to exempt
him from the punishment of eternal fire, though his failure to believe
has been the result of his not having at all heard what he should
believe; but probably only so far as to mitigate his punishment. For it
was not said without reason: “Pour out Thy wrath upon the heathen that
have not known Thee;”  <span id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989.md) nor
again according to what the apostle says: “When He shall come from
heaven in a flame of fire to take vengeance on them that know not
God.” <span id="fr_2990"></span>[2991](#fn_2990.md) But yet in order that
we may have that knowledge that will prevent our saying, each one of us,
“I did not know,” “I did not hear,” “I did not understand;” the human
will is summoned, in such words as these: “Wish not to be as the horse
or as the mule, which have no understanding;” <span
id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991.md) although it may show itself even
worse, of which it is written, “A stubborn servant will not be reproved
by words; for even if he understand, yet he will not obey.” <span
id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992.md) But when a man says, “I cannot do
what I am commanded, because I am mastered by my concupiscence,” he has
no longer any excuse to plead from ignorance, nor reason to blame God in
his heart, but he recognises and laments his own evil in himself; and
still to such an one the apostle says: “Be not overcome by evil, but
overcome evil with good;” <span id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md) and
of course the very fact that the injunction, “Consent not to be
overcome,” is addressed to him, undoubtedly summons the determination of
his will. For to consent and to refuse are functions proper to will.
