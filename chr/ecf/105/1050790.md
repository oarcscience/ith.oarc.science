<span id="xvii.vii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34 \[XXI.\]—Prophetic
Visions.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxxiv-p2"></span>Not every semblance of a body is
itself a body. Fall asleep and you will see this; but when you awake
again, carefully discern what it is you have seen. For in your dreams
you will appear to yourself as if endued with a body; but it really is
not your body, but your soul; nor is it a real body, but the semblance
of a body. Your body will be lying on the bed, but the soul walking; the
tongue of your body will be silent, but that of your soul in the dream
will talk; your eyes will be shut, but your soul will be awake; and, of
course, the limbs of your body stretched out in your bed will be alive,
not dead. Consequently that congealed form, as you regard it, of your
soul is not yet extracted, as it were, out of its sheath; and yet in it
is seen the whole and perfect semblance of your fleshly frame. Belonging
to this class of similitudes of corporeity, which are not real bodies,
though they seem to be such, are all those appearances which you read of
in the Holy Scriptures in the visions even of the prophets, without,
however, understanding them; by which are also signified the things
which come to pass in all time—present, past, and future. You make
mistakes about these, not because they are in themselves deceptive, but
because you do not accept them as they ought to be taken. For in the
same apocalyptic vision where “the souls of the martyrs” are seen, <span
id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501) there is also beheld “a lamb as it
were slain, having seven horns:” <span
id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502) there are also horses and other
animals figuratively described with all consistency; <span
id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503) and lastly, there were the stars
falling, and the earth rolled up like a book; <span
id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504) nor does the world, in spite of
all, then actually collapse. If therefore we understand all these things
wisely, although we say they are true apparitions, yet we do not call
them real bodies.
