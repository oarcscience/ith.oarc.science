<span id="x.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[VI.\]—Four Questions on the
Perfection of Righteousness: (1.) Whether a Man Can Be Without Sin in
This Life.</span>

<span id="x.iv.vii-p2"></span>Now those who aver that a man can exist in
this life without sin, must not be immediately opposed with incautious
rashness; for if we should deny the possibility, we should derogate both
from the free will of man, who in his wish desires it, and from the
power or mercy of God, who by His help effects it. But it is one
question, whether he *could* exist; and another question, whether he
*does* exist. Again, it is one question, if he does not exist when he
could exist, *why* he does not exist; and another question, *whether*
such a man as had never sinned at all, not only is in existence, but
also could ever have existed, or can ever exist. Now, if in the order of
this fourfold set of interrogative propositions, I were asked, \[1st,\]
Whether it be possible for a man in this life to be without sin? I
should allow the possibility, through the grace of God and the man’s own
free will; not doubting that the free will itself is ascribable to God’s
grace, in other words, to the gifts of God,—not only as to its
existence, but also as to its being good, that is, to its conversion to
doing the commandments of God. Thus it is that God’s grace not only
shows what ought to be done, but also helps to the possibility of doing
what it shows. “What <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span
id="x.iv.vii-Page_47"></span>indeed have we that we have not
received?” <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473) Whence also Jeremiah
says: “I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in himself; it is not
in man to walk and direct his steps.” <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474) Accordingly, when in the Psalms one
says to God, “Thou hast commanded me to keep Thy precepts
diligently,” <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475) he at once adds not
a word of confidence concerning himself but a wish to be able to keep
these precepts: “O that my ways,” says he, “were directed to keep Thy
statutes! Then should I not be ashamed, when I have respect to all Thy
commandments? <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476) Now who ever
wishes for what he has already so in his own power, that he requires no
further help for attaining it? To whom, however, he directs his
wish,—not to fortune, or fate, or some one else besides God,—he shows
with sufficient clearness in the following words, where he says: “Order
my steps in Thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over
me.” <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477) From the thraldom of this
execrable dominion they are liberated, to whom the Lord Jesus gave power
to become the sons of God. <span id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478) From
so horrible a domination were they to be freed, to whom He says, “If the
Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed.” <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479) From these and many other like
testimonies, I cannot doubt that God has laid no impossible command on
man; and that, by God’s aid and help, nothing is impossible, by which is
wrought what He commands. In this way may a man, if he pleases, be
without sin by the assistance of God.
