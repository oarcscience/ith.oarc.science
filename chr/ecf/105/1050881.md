<span id="xviii.v.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—The Perfection of Apostles and
Prophets.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xv-p2"></span>Since, then, all righteous men, both the
more ancient and the apostles, lived from a right faith which is in
Christ Jesus our Lord; and had with their faith morals so holy, that
although they might not be of such perfect virtue in this life as that
which should be after this life, yet whatever of sin might creep in from
human infirmity might be constantly done away by the piety of their
faith itself: it results from this that, in comparison with the wicked
whom God will condemn, it must be said that these were “righteous,”
since by their pious faith they were so far removed into the opposite of
those wicked men that the apostle cries out, “What part hath he that
believeth with an infidel?” <span id="fr_2734"></span>[2735](#fn_2734)
But it is plain that the Pelagians, these modern heretics, seem to
themselves to be religious lovers and praisers of the saints, since they
do not dare to say that they were of an imperfect virtue; although that
elected vessel confesses this, who, considering in what state he still
was, and that the body which is corrupted drags down the soul, says,
“Not that I have already attained or am yet perfect; brethren, I count
not myself to have apprehended.”  <span
id="fr_2735"></span>[2736](#fn_2735) And yet a little after, he who had
denied himself to be perfect says, “Let us therefore, as many as be
perfect, be thus minded,” <span id="fr_2736"></span>[2737](#fn_2736) in
order that he might show that, according to the measure of this life,
there is a certain perfection, and that to that perfection this also is
to be attributed, even although any one may know that he is not yet
perfect. For what is more perfect, or what was more excellent, than the
holy priests among the ancient people? And yet God prescribed to them to
offer sacrifice first of all for their own sins. And what is more holy
among the new people than the apostles? And yet the Lord prescribed to
them to say in their prayer, “Forgive us our debts.” For all the pious,
therefore, who lie under this burden of a corruptible flesh, and groan
in the infirmity of this life of theirs, there is one hope: “We have an
advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and He is the
propitiation for our sins.” <span id="fr_2737"></span>[2738](#fn_2737)
