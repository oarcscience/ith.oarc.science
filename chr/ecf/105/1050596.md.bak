<span id="xvi.v.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31 \[XXVIII.\]—Who is the Man that
Can Say, “It is No More I that Do It”?</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxi-p2"></span>A man, however, is much deceived if,
while consenting to the lust of his flesh, and then both resolving in
his mind to do its desires and setting about it, he supposes that he has
still a right to say, “It is not I that do it,” even if he hates and
loathes himself for assenting to evil desires. The two things are
simultaneous in his case: he hates the thing himself because he knows
that it is evil; and yet he does it, because he is bent on doing it. Now
if, in addition to all this, he proceeds to do what the Scripture
forbids him, when it says, “Neither yield ye your members as instruments
of unrighteousness unto sin,” <span id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md)
and completes with a bodily act what he was bent on doing in his mind;
and says, “It is not I that do the thing, but sin that dwelleth in
me,” <span id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md) because he feels
displeased with himself for resolving on and accomplishing the deed,—he
so greatly errs as not to know his own self. For, whereas he is
altogether himself, his mind determining and his body executing his own
purpose, he yet supposes that he is himself no longer! \[XXIX.\] That
man, therefore, alone speaks the truth when he says, “It is no more I
that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me,” who only feels the
concupiscence, and neither resolves on doing it with the consent of his
heart, nor accomplishes it with the ministry of his body.
