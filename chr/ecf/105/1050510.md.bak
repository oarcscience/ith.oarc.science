<span id="xv.iii.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 55 \[L.\]—Ambrose Witnesses that
Perfect Purity is Impossible to Human Nature.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.lv-p2"></span>He ought, moreover, carefully to note
that, in the very same context from which he quoted that passage of
Ambrose’s, which seemed so satisfactory for his purpose, he also said
this: “To be spotless from the beginning is an impossibility to human
nature.” <span id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md) In this sentence the
venerable Ambrose does undoubtedly predicate feebleness and infirmity of
that natural “capacity,” which Pelagius refuses faithfully to regard as
corrupted by sin, and therefore boastfully extols. Beyond question, this
runs counter to this man’s will and inclination, although it does not
contravene the truthful confession of the apostle, wherein he says: “We
too were once by nature the children of wrath, even as others.” <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md) For through the sin of the first
man, which came from his free will, our nature became corrupted and
ruined; and nothing but God’s grace alone, through Him who is the
Mediator between God and men, and our Almighty Physician, succours it.
Now, since we have already prolonged this work too far in treating of
the assistance of the divine grace towards our justification, by which
God co-operates in all things for good with those who love Him, <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) and whom He first loved <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) —giving to them that He might
receive from them: we must commence another treatise, as the Lord shall
enable us, on the subject of sin also, which by one man has entered into
the world, along with death, and so has passed upon all men, <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) setting forth as much as shall seem
needful and sufficient, in opposition to those persons who have broken
out into violent and open error, contrary to the truth here stated.
