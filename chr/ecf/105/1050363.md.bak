<span id="xiii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>(27.) Who May Be Said to Keep the Ways of the
Lord; What It is to Decline and Depart from the Ways of the Lord.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxxi-p2"></span>Then again, as for what he says, “For I
have kept His ways, and have not turned aside from His commandments, nor
will I depart from them;” <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) he
has kept God’s ways who does not so turn aside as to forsake them, but
makes progress by running his course therein; although, weak as he is,
he sometimes stumbles or falls, onward, however, he still goes, sinning
less and less until he reaches the perfect state in which he will sin no
more. For in no other way could he make progress, except by keeping His
ways. The man, indeed, who declines from these and becomes an apostate
at last, is certainly not he who, although he has sin, yet never ceases
to persevere in fighting against it until he arrives at the home where
there shall remain no more conflict with death. Well now, it is in our
present struggle therewith that we are clothed with the righteousness in
which we here live by faith,—clothed with it as it were with a
breastplate. <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md) Judgment also we
take on ourselves; and even when it is against us, we turn it round to
our own behalf; for we become our own accusers and condemn our sins:
whence that scripture which says, “The righteous man accuses himself at
the beginning of his speech.” <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md)
Hence also he says: “I put on righteousness, and clothed myself with
judgment like a mantle.” <span id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) Our
vesture at present no doubt is wont to be armour for war rather than
garments of peace, while concupiscence has still to be subdued; it will
be different by and by, when our last enemy death shall be
destroyed, <span id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md) and our
righteousness shall be full and complete, without an enemy to molest us
more.
