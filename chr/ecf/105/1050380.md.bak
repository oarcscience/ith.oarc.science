<span id="xiii.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—(44.) Conclusion of the Work.
In the Regenerate It is Not Concupiscence, But Consent, Which is
Sin.</span>

<span id="xiii.xlviii-p2"></span>Whosoever, then, supposes that any man
or any men (except the one Mediator between God and man <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593) .md) have ever lived, or are yet
living in this present state, who have not needed, and do not need,
forgiveness of sins, he opposes Holy Scripture, wherein it is said by
the apostle: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;
and so death passed upon all men, in which all have sinned.” <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) And he must needs go on to assert,
with an impious contention, that there may possibly be men who are freed
and saved from sin without the liberation and salvation of the one
Mediator Christ. Whereas He it is who has said: “They that be whole need
not a physician, but they that are sick;” <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md) “I am not come to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.” <span
id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) He, moreover, who says that any
man, after he has received remission of sins, has ever lived in this
body, or still is living, so righteously as to have no sin at all, he
contradicts the Apostle John, who declares that “If we say we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) Observe, the expression is not *we
had*, but “*we have*.” If, however, anybody contend that the apostle’s
statement concerns the sin which dwells in our mortal flesh according to
the defect which was caused by the will of the first man when he sinned,
and concerning which the Apostle Paul enjoins us “not” to “obey it in
the lusts thereof, <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) —so that
he does not sin who altogether withholds his consent from this same
indwelling sin, and so brings it to no evil work,—either in deed, or
word, or thought,—although the lusting after it may be excited (which in
another sense has received the name of sin, inasmuch as consenting to it
would amount to sinning), but excited against our will,—he certainly is
drawing subtle distinctions, and should consider what relation all this
bears to the Lord’s Prayer, wherein we say, “Forgive us our
debts.” <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) Now, if I judge
aright, it would be unnecessary to put up such a prayer as this, if we
never in the least degree consented to the lusts of the before-mentioned
sin, either in a slip of the tongue, or in a wanton thought; all that it
would be needful to say would be, “Lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil.” <span id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md) Nor
could the Apostle James say: “In many things we all offend.” <span
id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) For in truth only that man offends
whom an evil concupiscence persuades, either by deception or by force,
to do or say or think something which he ought to avoid, by directing
his appetites or his aversions contrary to the rule of righteousness.
Finally, if it be asserted that there either have been, or are in this
present life, any persons, with the sole exception of our Great Head,
“the Saviour of His body,” <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md)
who are righteous, without any sin,—and this, either by not consenting
to the lusts thereof, or because that must not be accounted as any sin
which is such that God does not impute it to them by reason of their
godly lives (although the blessedness of being without sin is a
different thing from the blessedness of not having one’s sin imputed to
him), <span id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) —I do not deem it
necessary to contest the point over much. I am quite aware that some
hold this opinion, <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) whose
views on the subject I have not the courage to censure, although, at the
same time, I cannot defend them. But if any man says that we ought not
to use the prayer, “Lead us not into temptation” (and he says as much
who maintains that God’s help is unnecessary to a person for the
avoidance of sin, and that human will, after accepting only the law, is
sufficient for the purpose), then I do not hesitate at once to affirm
that such a man ought to be removed from the public ear, and to be
anathematized by every mouth.
