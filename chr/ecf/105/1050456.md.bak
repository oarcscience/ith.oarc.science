id="xv.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—Introductory.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xv.iii.i-p2.1"></span>How</span> greatly we rejoice on account of
your bodily, and, above all, your spiritual welfare, my most sincerely
attached brethren and beloved of God, Albina, Pinianus, and
Melania, <span id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) we cannot express in
words; we therefore leave all this to your own thoughts and belief, in
order that we may now rather speak of the matters on which you consulted
us. We have, indeed, had to compose these words to the best of the
ability which God has vouchsafed to us, while our messenger was in a
hurry to be gone, and amidst many occupations, which are much more
absorbing to me at Carthage than in any other place whatever.
