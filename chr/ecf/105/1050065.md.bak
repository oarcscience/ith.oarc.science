id="x.iii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47.—From the Epistle to the
Colossians.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xlvii-p2"></span>To the Colossians he addresses these
words: “Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered
us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom
of His dear Son; in whom we have redemption in the remission of our
sins.” <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) And again he says: “And
ye are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality and power:
in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
hands, in putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of
Christ; buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him
through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the
dead. And you, when ye were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
your flesh, hath He quickened together with Him, having forgiven you all
trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against
us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to
His cross; and putting the flesh off Him, <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) He made a show of principalities and
powers, confidently triumphing over them in Himself.” <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md)
