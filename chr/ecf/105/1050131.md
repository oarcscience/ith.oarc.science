<span id="x.iv.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—Sanctification Manifold;
Sacrament of Catechumens.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xlii-p2"></span>Our opinions on this point are strictly
in unison with the apostle’s himself, who said, “From one all to
condemnation,” and “from one all to justification of life.” <span
id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606.md) Now how consistent these statements
are with what he elsewhere says, when treating of another point, “Else
were your children unclean, but now are they holy,” consider a while.
\[XXVI.\] Sanctification is not of merely one measure; for even
catechumens, I take it, are sanctified in their own measure by the sign
of Christ, and the prayer of imposition of hands; and what they receive
is holy, although it is not the body of Christ,—holier than any food
which constitutes our ordinary nourishment, because it is a
sacrament. <span id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607.md) However, that very
meat and drink, wherewithal the necessities of our present life are
sustained, are, according to the same apostle, “sanctified by the word
of God and prayer,” <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md) even the
prayer with which we beg that our bodies may be refreshed. Just as
therefore this sanctification of our ordinary food does not hinder what
enters the mouth from descending into the belly, and being ejected into
the draught, <span id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609.md) and partaking of
the corruption into which everything earthly is resolved, whence the
Lord exhorts us to labour for the other food which never perishes: <span
id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610.md) so the sanctification of the
catechumen, if he is not baptized, does not avail for his entrance into
the kingdom of heaven, nor for the remission of his sins. And, by parity
of reasoning, that sanctification likewise, of whatever measure it be,
which, according to the apostle, is in the children of believers, has
nothing whatever to do with the question of baptism and of the origin or
the remission of sin. <span id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611.md) The
apostle, in this very passage which has occupied our attention, says
that the unbeliever of a married couple is sanctified by a believing
partner: “For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband. Else were your children
unclean, but now are they holy.” <span id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612.md)
Now, I should say, there is not a man whose mind is so warped by
unbelief, as to suppose that, whatever sense he gives to these words,
they can possibly mean that a husband who is not a Christian should not
be baptized, because his wife is a Christian, and that he has already
obtained remission of his sins, with the certain prospect of entering
the kingdom of heaven, because he is described as being sanctified by
his wife.

<span id="x.iv.xlii-p4"></span> Catechumens received the *sacramentum
salis*—salt placed in the mouth—with other rites, such as exorcism and
the sign of the cross; the Lord’s Prayer and other invocations
concluding the ceremony. See Canon 5 of the third Council of Carthage;
also Augustin’s *De Catechiz. Rud*. 50; and his *Confessions*, i. 11,
where (speaking of his own catechumenical course) he says: “I was now
signed with the sign of His cross, and was *seasoned with His salt*.”
