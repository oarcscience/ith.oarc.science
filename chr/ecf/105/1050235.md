<span id="xi.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 59.—Mercy and Pity in the Judgment of
God.</span>

<span id="xi.lxii-p2"></span>This is the order observed in the psalm,
where it is said: “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His
recompenses; who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
with loving-kindness and tender mercy; who satisfieth thy desire with
good things.” <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) And lest by any
chance these great blessings should be despaired of under the deformity
of our old, that is, mortal condition, the Psalmist at once says, “Thy
youth shall be renewed like the eagle’s;” <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md) as much as to say, All that you
have heard belongs to the new man and to the new covenant. Now let us
consider together briefly these things, and with delight contemplate the
praise of mercy, that is, of the grace of God. “Bless the Lord, O my
soul,” he says, “and forget not all His recompenses.” Observe, he does
not say blessings, but *recompenses*; <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) be<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>
<span id="xi.lxii-Page_110"></span>cause He recompenses evil with good.
“Who forgiveth all thine iniquities:” this is done in the sacrament of
baptism. “Who healeth all thy diseases:” this is effected by the
believer in the present life, while the flesh so lusts against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, that we do not the things we
would; <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) whilst also another
law in our members wars against the law of our mind; <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) whilst to will is present indeed to
us but not how to perform that which is good. <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) These are the diseases of a man’s
old nature which, however, if we only advance with persevering purpose,
are healed by the growth of the new nature day by day, by the faith
which operates through love. <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md)
“Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;” this will take place at the
resurrection of the dead in the last day. “Who crowneth thee with
loving-kindness and tender mercy;” this shall be accomplished in the day
of judgment; for when the righteous King shall sit upon His throne to
render to every man according to his works, who shall then boast of
having a pure heart? or who shall glory of being clean from sin? It was
therefore necessary to mention God’s loving-kindness and tender mercy
there, where one might expect debts to be demanded and deserts
recompensed so strictly as to leave no room for mercy. He crowns,
therefore, with loving-kindness and tender mercy; but even so according
to works. For he shall be separated to the right hand, to whom, it is
said, “I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat.” <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) There will, however, be also
“judgment without mercy;” but it will be for him “that hath not showed
mercy.” <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) But “blessed are the
merciful: for they shall obtain mercy” <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) of God. Then, as soon as those on
the left hand shall have gone into eternal fire, the righteous, too,
shall go into everlasting life, <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) because He says: “This is life
eternal, that they may know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ
whom Thou hast sent.” <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) And
with this knowledge, this vision, this contemplation, shall the desire
of their soul be satisfied; for it shall be enough for it to have this
and nothing else,—there being nothing more for it to desire, to aspire
to, or to require. It was with a craving after this full joy that his
heart glowed who said to the Lord Christ, “Show us the Father, and it
sufficeth us;” and to whom the answer was returned, “He that hath seen
me hath seen the Father.”  <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md)
Because He is Himself the eternal life, in order that men may know the
one true God, Thee and whom Thou hast sent, Jesus Christ. If, however,
he that has seen the Son has also seen the Father, then assuredly he who
sees the Father and the Son sees also the Holy Spirit of the Father and
the Son. So we do not take away free will, whilst our soul blesses the
Lord and forgets not all His recompenses; <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) nor does it, in ignorance of God’s
righteousness, wish to set up one of its own; <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) but it believes in Him who
justifies the ungodly, <span id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) and
until it arrives at sight, it lives by faith,—even the faith which works
by love. <span id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) And this love is
shed abroad in our hearts, not by the sufficiency of our own will, nor
by the letter of the law, but by the Holy Ghost who has been given to
us. <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md)
