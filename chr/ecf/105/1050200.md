<span id="xi.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—The Passage in Corinthians.</span>

<span id="xi.xxvii-p2"></span>In the passage where he speaks to the
Corinthians about the letter that kills, and the spirit that gives life,
he expresses himself more clearly, but he does not mean even there any
other “letter” to be understood than the Decalogue itself, which was
written on the two tables. For these are His words: “Forasmuch as ye are
manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us,
written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in
tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. And such trust have
we through Christ to God-ward: not that we are sufficient of ourselves
to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; who
hath made us fit, as ministers of the new testament; not of the letter,
but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was
glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the
face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which was to be done
away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?
For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more shall the
ministration of righteousness abound in glory. <span
id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) A good deal might be said about these
words; but perhaps we shall have a more fitting opportunity at some
future time. At present, however, I beg you to observe how he speaks of
the letter that killeth, and contrasts therewith the spirit that giveth
life. Now this must certainly be “the ministration of death written and
engraven in stones,” and “the ministration of condemnation,” since the
law entered that sin might abound. <span
id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md) But the commandments themselves are so
useful and salutary to the doer of them, <span id="page_94">p. 94</span>
<span id="xi.xxvii-Page_94"></span>that no one could have life unless he
kept them. Well, then, is it owing to the one precept about the
Sabbath-day, which is included in it, that the Decalogue is called “the
letter that killeth?” Because, forsooth, every man that still observes
that day in its literal appointment is carnally wise, but to be carnally
wise is nothing else than death? And must the other nine commandments,
which are rightly observed in their literal form, not be regarded as
belonging to the law of works by which none is justified, but to the law
of faith whereby the just man lives? Who can possibly entertain so
absurd an opinion as to suppose that “the ministration of death, written
and engraven in stones,” is not said equally of all the ten
commandments, but only of the solitary one touching the Sabbath-day? In
which class do we place that which is thus spoken of: “The law worketh
wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression?” <span
id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md) and again thus: “Until the law sin was
in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law?” <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) and also that which we have already so
often quoted: “By the law is the knowledge of sin?” <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) and especially the passage in which
the apostle has more clearly expressed the question of which we are
treating: “I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not
covet?” <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md)
