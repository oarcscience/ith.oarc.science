<span id="xi.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35 \[XX.\]—The Old Law; The New
Law.</span>

<span id="xi.xxxviii-p2"></span>The one was therefore old, because the
other is new. But whence comes it that one is old and the other new,
when the same law, which said in the Old Testament, “Thou shalt not
<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span
id="xi.xxxviii-Page_98"></span>covet,” <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859) is fulfilled by the New Testament?
“Because,” says the prophet, “they continued not in my covenant, I have
also rejected them, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860) It is then on account of the offence
of the old man, which was by no means healed by the letter which
commanded and threatened, that it is called the old covenant; whereas
the other is called the new covenant, because of the newness of the
spirit, which heals the new man of the fault of the old. Then consider
what follows, and see in how clear a light the fact is placed, that men
who bare faith are unwilling to trust in themselves: “Because,” says he,
“this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel; After
those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and
write it in their hearts.” <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861) See
how similarly the apostle states it in the passage we have already
quoted: “Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the
heart,” <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862) because “not with ink,
but with the Spirit of the living God.” <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863) And I apprehend that the apostle in
this passage had no other reason for mentioning “the New Testament”
(“who hath made us able ministers of the *New Testament*; not of the
letter, but of the spirit”), than because he had an eye to the words of
the prophet, when he said “Not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
of the heart,” inasmuch as in the prophet it runs: “I will write it in
their hearts.” <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864)
