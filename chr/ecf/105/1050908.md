<span id="xviii.vi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—From Such Scriptures Grace is
Proved to Be Gratuitous and Effectual.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xv-p2"></span>What remained to the carrion skin
whence it might be puffed up, and could disdain when it glories to glory
in the Lord? <span id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) What remained to
it, when whatsoever it shall have said that it has done in such a way
that after that preceding merit of man had originated from man, God
should subsequently do that of which the man is deserving,—it shall be
answered, it shall be exclaimed against, it shall be contradicted, “I do
it; but for my own holy name’s sake; not for your sakes, do I do it,
saith the Lord God”? <span id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) Nothing
so overturns the Pelagians when they say that the grace of God is given
in respect of our merits. Which, indeed, Pelagius himself
condemned, <span id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) and if not by
correcting it, yet by being afraid of the Eastern judges. Nothing so
overturns the presumption of men who say, “We do it, that we may deserve
those things with which God may do it.” It is not Pelagius that answers
you, but the Lord Himself, “I do it and not for your sakes, but for my
own holy name’s sake.” <span id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) For
what good can ye do out of a heart which is not good? But that you may
have a good heart, He says, “I will give you a new heart, and I will put
a new Spirit within you.” Can you say, We will first walk in His
righteousness, and will observe His judgment, and will do so that we may
be worthy, such as He should give His grace to? But what good would ye
evil men do, and how should you do those good things, unless you were
yourselves good? But who causes that men should be good save Him who
said, “And I will visit them to make them good”? and who said “I will
put my Spirit within you, and will cause you to walk in my
righteousness, and to observe my judgments, and do them”? Are ye thus
not yet awake? Do ye not yet hear, “I will cause you to walk, I will
make you to observe,” lastly, “I will make you to do”? What! are you
still puffing yourselves up? We indeed walk, it is true; we observe; we
do; but He makes us to walk, to observe, to do. This is the grace of God
making us good; this is His mercy preventing us. What do waste and
desolated and dug-up places deserve, which yet shall be built and tilled
and fortified? Are these things for the merits of their wasteness, their
desolation, their uprooting? Far from it. For such things as these are
evil deservings, while those gifts are good. Therefore good things are
given for evil ones—gratuitous, therefore; not of debt, and therefore
grace. “I,” saith the Lord: “I, the Lord.” Does not such a word as that
restrain you, O human pride, when you say, I do such things as to
deserve from the Lord to be built and planted? Do you not hear, “I do it
not on your account; I the Lord have built up the destroyed cities, and
I have planted the desolated lands; I the Lord have spoken, and I have
done it, yet not for your sakes, but for my own holy name’s sake”? Who
multiplies men as sheep, as holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem? Who
causes those desolated cities to be full of men as sheep, save He who
goes on, and says, “And they shall know that I am the Lord”? But with
what men as sheep does He fill the cities as He promised? those which He
finds, or those which He makes? Let us interrogate the Psalm; lo, it
answers; let us hear: “O come, let us worship and fall down before Him:
and let us weep before the Lord who made us; because He is our God, and
we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.” <span
id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md) He therefore makes the sheep, with
which He may fill the desolated cities. What wonder, when, indeed, to
that single sheep, that is, the Church whose members are all the human
sheep, it is said, “Because I am the Lord who make thee”? What do you
pretend to me of free will, which will not be free to do righteousness,
unless you should be a sheep? He then who makes men His sheep, He frees
the wills of men for the obedience of piety.
