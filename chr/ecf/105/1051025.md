<span id="xx.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—Even in Judgment God’s Mercy Will
Be Necessary to Us.</span>

<span id="xx.xliv-p2"></span>For the Holy Scripture testifies that God’s
mercy is then also necessary for them, when the Saint says to his soul
concerning the Lord its God, “Who crowneth thee in mercy and
compassion.” <span id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381) The Apostle
James also says: “He shall have judgment without mercy who hath showed
no mercy;” <span id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382) where he sets
forth that even in that judgment in which the righteous are crowned and
the unrighteous are condemned, some will be judged with mercy, others
without mercy. On which account also the mother of the Maccabees says to
her son, “That in that mercy I may receive thee with thy
brethren.” <span id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383) “For when a
righteous king,” as it is written, “shall sit on the throne, no evil
thing shall oppose itself to him. Who will boast that he has a pure
heart? or who will boast that he is pure from sin?” <span
id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384) And thus God’s mercy is even then
necessary, by which he is made “blessed to whom the Lord has not imputed
sin.” <span id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385) But at that time even
mercy itself shall be allotted in righteous judgment in accordance with
the merits of good works. For when it is said, “Judgment without mercy
to him that hath showed no mercy,” it is plainly shown that in those in
whom are found the good works of mercy, judgment shall be executed with
mercy; and thus even that mercy itself shall be returned to the merits
of good works. It is not so now; when not only no good works, but many
bad works precede, His mercy anticipates a man so that he is delivered
from evils,—as well from evils which he has done, as from those which he
would have done if he were not controlled by the grace of God; and from
those, too, which he would have suffered for ever if he were not plucked
from the power of darkness, and transferred into the kingdom of the Son
of God’s love. <span id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386) Nevertheless,
since even that life eternal <span id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span
id="xx.xliv-Page_489"></span>itself, which, it is certain, is given as
due to good works, is called by so great an apostle the grace of God,
although grace is not rendered to works, but is given freely, it must be
confessed without any doubt, that eternal life is called grace for the
reason that it is rendered to those merits which grace has conferred
upon man. Because that saying is rightly understood which in the gospel
is read, “grace for grace,” <span id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387)
—that is, for those merits which grace has conferred.
