<span id="xvii.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—The Difference Between the Senses
of the Body and Soul.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.iii-p2"></span>Again, I wonder whether this man taught
you the difference between the bodily senses and the sensibilities of
the soul; and whether you, who were a person of considerable age and
position before you took lessons of this man, used to consider to be one
and the same that faculty by which white and black are distinguished,
which sparrows even see as well as ourselves, and that by which justice
and injustice are discriminated, which Tobit also perceived even after
he lost the sight of his eyes. <span
id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) If you held the identity, then, of
course, when you heard or read the words, “Lighten my eyes, that I sleep
not in death,” <span id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md) you merely
thought of the eyes of the body. Or if this were an obscure point, at
all events when you recalled the words of the apostle, “The eyes of your
heart being enlightened,” <span id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) you
must have supposed that we possessed a heart somewhere between our
forehead and cheeks. Well, I am very far from thinking this of you, so
that this instructor of yours could not have given you such a lesson.
