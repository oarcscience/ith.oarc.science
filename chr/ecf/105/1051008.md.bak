<span id="xx.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Even the Sins of the Elect are
Turned by God to Their Advantage.</span>

<span id="xx.xxvii-p2"></span>To such as love Him, God co-worketh with
all things for good; so absolutely *all* things, that even if any of
them go astray, and break out of the way, even this itself He makes to
avail them for good, so that they return more lowly and more instructed.
For they learn that in the right way <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) itself they ought to rejoice with
trembling; not with arrogation to themselves of confidence of abiding as
if by their own strength; not with saying, in their abundance, “We shall
not be moved for ever.” <span id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) For
which reason it is said to them, “Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice
unto Him with trembling, lest at any time the Lord should be angry, and
ye perish from the right way.” <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md) For He does not say, “And ye come
not into the right way;” but He says, “Lest ye perish from the right
way.” And what does this show, but that those who are already walking in
the right way are reminded to serve God in fear; that is, “not to be
high-minded, but to fear”? <span id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md)
which signifies, that they should not be haughty, but humble. Whence
also He says in another place, “not minding high things, but consenting
with the lowly;” <span id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331.md) let them
rejoice in God, but with trembling; glorying in none, since nothing is
ours, so that he who glorieth may glory in the Lord, lest they perish
from the right way in which they have already begun to walk, while they
are ascribing to themselves their very presence in it. These words also
the apostle made use of when he says, “Work out your own salvation with
fear and trembling.” <span id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332.md) And
setting forth why with fear and trembling, he says, “For it is God that
worketh in you, both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” <span
id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333.md) For he had not this fear and
trembling who said in his abundance, “I shall not be moved for
ever.” <span id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334.md) But because he was a
child of the promise, not of perdition, he experienced in God’s
desertion for a little while what he himself was: “Lord,” said he, “in
Thy favour Thou gavest strength to my honour; Thou turnedst away Thy
face from me, and I became troubled.” <span
id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335.md) Behold how much better instructed,
and for this reason also more humble, he held on his way, at length
seeing and confessing that by His will God had endowed his honour with
strength; and this he had attributed to himself and presumed to be from
himself, in such abundance as God had afforded it, and not from Him who
had given it, and so had said, “I shall not be moved for ever!”
Therefore he became troubled so that he found himself, and being lowly
minded learnt not only of eternal life, but, moreover, of a pious
conversation and perseverance in this life, as that in which hope should
be maintained. This might moreover be the word of the Apostle Peter,
because he also had said in his abundance, “I will <span
id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span id="xx.xxvii-Page_482"></span>lay down
my life for Thy sake;” <span id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336.md)
attributing to himself, in his eagerness, what was afterwards to be
bestowed on him by his Lord. But the Lord turned away His face from him,
and he became troubled, so that in his fear of dying for Him he thrice
denied Him. But the Lord again turned His face to him, and washed away
his sin with his tears. For what else is, “He turned and looked upon
him,” <span id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337.md) but, He restored to him
the face which, for a little while, He had turned away from him?
Therefore he had become troubled; but because he learned not to be
confident concerning himself, even this was of excellent profit to him,
by His agency who co-works for good with all things to those who love
Him; because he had been called according to the purpose, so that no one
could pluck him out of the hand of Christ, to whom he had been given.
