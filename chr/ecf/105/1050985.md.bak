id="xx.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—Introductory.</span>

<span id="xx.iv-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xx.iv-p2.1"></span>I Have</span> read your letter—Valentine, my
dearly beloved brother, and you who are associated with him in the
service of God—which your Love sent by brother Florus and those who came
to us with him; and I gave God thanks that I have known your peace in
the Lord and agreement in the truth and ardour in love, by your
discourse delivered to us. But that an enemy has striven among you to
the subversion of some, has, by the mercy of God and His marvellous
goodness in turning his arts to the advantage <span
id="fr_3235"></span>[3236](#fn_3235.md) of His servants, rather availed to
this result, that while none of you were cast down for the worse, some
were built up for the better. There is therefore no need to reconsider
again and again all that I have already transmitted to you, sufficiently
argued out in a lengthy treatise; <span
id="fr_3236"></span>[3237](#fn_3236.md) for your replies indicate how you
have received this. Nevertheless, do not in any wise suppose that, when
once read, it can have become sufficiently well known to you. Therefore
if you desire to have it exceedingly productive, do not count it a
grievance by re-perusal to make it thoroughly familiar; so that you may
most accurately <span id="fr_3237"></span>[3238](#fn_3237.md) know what and
what kind of questions they are, for the solution and satisfaction of
which there arises an authority not human but divine, from which we
ought not to depart if we desire to attain to the point whither we are
tending.
