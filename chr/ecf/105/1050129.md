id="x.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—An Argument Anticipated.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xl-p2"></span>And let no one contend that the descendants
of Abraham might fairly enough have paid tithes, although they had
already paid tithes in the loins of their forefather, seeing that paying
tithes was an obligation of such a nature as to require constant
repetition from each several person, just as the Israelites used to pay
such contributions every year all through life to their Levites, to whom
were due various tithes from all kinds of produce; whereas baptism is a
sacrament of such a nature as is administered once for all, and if one
had already received it when in his father, he must be considered as no
other than baptized, since he was born of a man who had been himself
baptized. Well, whoever thus argues (I will simply say, without
discussing the point at length,) should look at circumcision, which was
administered once for all, and yet was administered to each person
separately and individually. Just as therefore it was necessary in the
time of that ancient sacrament for the son of a circumcised man to be
himself circumcised, so now the son of one who has been baptized must
himself also receive baptism.
