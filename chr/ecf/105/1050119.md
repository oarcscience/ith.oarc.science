<span id="x.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—All Will is Either Good, and Then
It Loves Righteousness, or Evil, When It Does Not Love
Righteousness.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxx-p2"></span>Unless, therefore, we obtain not simply
determination of will, which is freely turned in this direction and
that, and has its place amongst those natural goods which a bad man may
use badly; but also a good will, which has its place among those goods
of which it is impossible to make a bad use:—unless the impossibility is
given to us from God, I know not how to defend what is said: “What hast
thou that thou didst not receive?” For if we have from God a certain
free will, which may still be either good or bad; but the good will
comes from ourselves; then that which comes from ourselves is better
than that which comes from Him. But inasmuch as it is the height of
absurdity to say this, they ought to acknowledge that we attain from God
even a good will. It would indeed be a strange thing if the will could
so stand in some mean as to be neither good nor bad; for we either love
righteousness, and it is good, and if we love it more, more good,—if
less, it is less good; or if we do not love it at all, it is not good.
And who can hesitate to affirm that, when the will loves not
righteousness in any way at all, it is not only a bad, but even a wholly
depraved will? Since therefore the will is either good or bad, and since
of course we have not the bad will from God, it remains that we have of
God a good will; else, I am ignorant, since our justification is from
it, in what other gift from Him we ought to rejoice. Hence, I suppose,
it is written, “The will is prepared of the Lord;” <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) and in the Psalms, “The steps of a man
will be rightly ordered by the Lord, and His way will be the choice of
his will;” <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md) and that which the
apostle says, “For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do
of His own good pleasure.” <span id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md)
