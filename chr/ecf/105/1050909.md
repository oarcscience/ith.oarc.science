<span id="xviii.vi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Why God Makes of Some Sheep,
Others Not.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xvi-p2"></span>But wherefore does God make these men
sheep, and those not, since with Him there is no acceptance of persons?
This is the very question which the blessed apostle thus answers to
those who propose it with more curiosity than propriety, “O man, who art
thou that repliest against God? Does the thing formed say to him that
formed it, Wherefore hast thou made me thus?” <span
id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md) This is the very question which
belongs to that depth desiring to look into which the same apostle was
in a certain measure terrified, and exclaimed, “Oh the depth of the
riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His
judgments, and His ways past finding out! For who has known the mind of
the Lord? or who has been His counsellor? Or who has first given to Him,
that it should be recompensed to Him again? Because of Him, and through
Him, and in Him, are all things: to Him be glory for ages of
ages.” <span id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829.md) Let them <span
id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span id="xviii.vi.xvi-Page_424"></span>not,
then, dare to pry into that unsearchable question who defend merit
before grace, and therefore even against grace, and wish first to give
unto God, that it may be given to them again,—first, of course, to give
something of free will, that grace may be given them again as a reward;
and let them wisely understand or faithfully believe that even what they
think that they have first given, they have received from Him, from whom
are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things. But why
this man should receive, and that should not receive, when neither of
them deserves to receive, and whichever of them receives, receives
undeservingly,—let them measure their own strength, and not search into
things too strong for them. Let it suffice them to know that there is no
unrighteousness with God. For when the apostle could find no merits for
which Jacob should take precedence of his twin-brother with God, he
said, “What, then, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? Away
with the thought! For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will
have mercy, and I will show compassion on whom I will show compassion.
Therefore it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of
God that showeth mercy.” <span id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830.md) Let,
therefore, His free compassion be grateful to us, even although this
profound question be still unsolved; which, nevertheless, is so far
solved as the same apostle solves it, saying, “But if God, willing to
show His wrath, and to demonstrate His power, endured in much patience
the vessels of wrath which are fitted to destruction; and that He might
make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He has
prepared for glory.” <span id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831.md)
Certainly wrath is not repaid unless it is due, lest there be
unrighteousness with God; but mercy, even when it is bestowed, and not
due, is not unrighteousness with God. And hence, let the vessels of
mercy understand how freely mercy is afforded to them, because to the
vessels of wrath with whom they have common cause and measure of
perdition, is repaid wrath, righteous and due. This is now enough in
opposition to those who, by freedom of will, desire to destroy the
liberality of grace.
