<span id="xii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38 \[XXXIV.\]—We Must Not Lie, Even
for the Sake of Moderation. The Praise of Humility Must Not Be Placed to
the Account of Falsehood.</span>

<span id="xii.xlii-p2"></span>I am favourably disposed, indeed, to the
view of our author, when he resists those who say to him, “What you
assert seems indeed to be reasonable, but it is an arrogant thing to
allege that any man can be without sin,” with this answer, that if it is
at all true, it must not on any account be called an arrogant statement;
for with very great truth and acuteness he asks, “On what side must
humility be placed? No doubt on the side of falsehood, if you prove
arrogance to exist on the side of truth.” And so he decides, and rightly
decides, that humility should rather be ranged on the side of truth, not
of falsehood. Whence it follows that he who said, “If we say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,” <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231) must without hesitation be held to
have spoken the truth, and not be thought to have spoken falsehood for
the sake of humility. Therefore he added the words, “And the truth is
not in us;” whereas it might perhaps have been enough if he merely said,
“We deceive ourselves,” if he had not observed that some were capable of
supposing that the clause “we deceive ourselves” is here employed on the
ground that the man who praises himself is even extolled for a really
good action. So that, by the addition of “the truth is not in us,” he
clearly shows (even as our author most correctly observes) that it is
not at all true if we say that we have no sin, lest humility, if placed
on the side of falsehood, should lose the reward of truth.
