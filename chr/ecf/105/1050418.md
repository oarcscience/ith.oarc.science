<span id="xiv.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—Discussion of the Eleventh Item
Continued.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxvii-p2"></span>What, then, is the reason why, as I said
just now, I felt anxious on the subject of this head of his doctrine? It
is occasioned by what Pelagius says in these words: “That God gives to
the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces, even
as He conferred them on the Apostle Paul.” Now, I should not have felt
any anxiety about this answer of Pelagius, if it were not closely
connected with the cause which we are bound to guard with the utmost
care—even that God’s grace may never be attacked, while we are silent or
dissembling in respect of so great an evil. As, therefore, he does not
say, that God gives to whom He will, but that “God gives to the man *who
has proved himself worthy to receive them*, all these graces,” I could
not help being suspicious, when I read such words. For the very name of
grace, and the thing that is meant by it, is taken away, if it is not
bestowed gratuitously, but he only receives it who is worthy of it. Will
anybody say that I do the apostle wrong, because I do not admit him to
have been worthy of grace? Nay, I should indeed rather do him wrong, and
bring on myself a punishment, if I refused to believe what he himself
says. Well, now, has he not pointedly so defined *grace* as to show that
it is so called because it is bestowed gratuitously? These are his own
very words: “And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise
grace is no more grace.” <span id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703.md) In
accordance with this, he says again: “Now to him that worketh is the
reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.” <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704.md) Whosoever, therefore, is worthy, to
him it is due; and if it is thus due to him, it ceases to be grace; for
grace is given, but a debt is paid. Grace, therefore, is given to those
who are unworthy, that a debt may be paid to them when they become
worthy. He, however, who has bestowed on the unworthy the gifts which
they possessed not before, does Himself take care that they shall have
whatever things He means to recompense to them when they become worthy.
