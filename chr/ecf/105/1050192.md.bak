<span id="xi.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[X.\]—How the Law Was Not Made for a
Righteous Man.</span>

<span id="xi.xix-p2"></span>Because “for a righteous man the law was not
made;” <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) and yet “the law is good,
if a man use it lawfully.” <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) Now
by connecting together these two seemingly contrary statements, the
apostle warns and urges his reader to sift the question and solve it
too. For how can it be that “the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,”
if what follows is also true: “Knowing this, that the law is not made
for a righteous man?” <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) For who
but a righteous man lawfully uses the law? Yet it is not for him that it
is made, but for the unrighteous. Must then the unrighteous man, in
order that he may be justified,—that is, become a righteous
man,—lawfully use the law, to lead him, as by the schoolmaster’s
hand, <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) to that grace by which
alone he can fulfil what the law commands? Now it is freely that he is
justified thereby,—that is, on account of no antecedent merits of his
own works; “otherwise grace is no more grace,” <span
id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) since it is bestowed on us, not
because we have done good works, but that we may be able to do them,—in
other words, not because we have fulfilled the law, but in order that we
may be able to fulfil the law. Now He said, “I am not come to destroy
the law, but to fulfil it,” <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) of
whom it was said, “We have seen His glory, the glory as of the
only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.” <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) This is the glory which is meant in
the words, “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;” <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) and this the grace of which he speaks
in the next verse, “Being justified freely by His grace.” <span
id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) The unrighteous man therefore lawfully
uses the law, that he may become righteous; but when he has become so,
he must no longer use it as a chariot, for he has arrived at his
journey’s end,—or rather (that I may employ the apostle’s own simile,
which has been already mentioned) as a schoolmaster, seeing that he is
now fully learned. How then is the law not made for a righteous man, if
it is necessary for the righteous man too, not that he may be brought as
an unrighteous man to the grace that justifies, but that he may use it
lawfully, now that he is righteous? Does not the case perhaps stand
thus,—nay, not *perhaps*, but rather *certainly*,—that the man who is
become righteous thus lawfully uses the law, when he applies it to alarm
the unrighteous, so that whenever the disease of some unusual desire
begins in them, too, to be augmented by the incentive of the law’s
prohibition and an increased <span id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span
id="xi.xix-Page_90"></span>amount of transgression, they may in faith
flee for refuge to the grace that justifies, and becoming delighted with
the sweet pleasures of holiness, may escape the penalty of the law’s
menacing letter through the spirit’s soothing gift? In this way the two
statements will not be contrary, nor will they be repugnant to each
other: even the righteous man may lawfully use a good law, and yet the
law be not made for the righteous man; for it is not by the law that he
becomes righteous, but by the law of faith, which led him to believe
that no other resource was possible to his weakness for fulfilling the
precepts which “the law of works” <span
id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) commanded, except to be assisted by
the grace of God.
