<span id="xv.iii.l-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50.—Ambrose Teaches that All Men Need
God’s Help.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.l-p2"></span>In the same book the same St. Ambrose says
again: <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904) “Now if Peter fell,
who said, ‘Though all men shall be offended, yet will I never be
offended,’ who else shall rightly presume concerning himself? David,
indeed, because he had said, ‘In my prosperity I said, I shall never be
moved,’ confesses how injurious his confidence had proved to himself:
‘Thou didst turn away Thy face,’ he says, ‘and I was troubled.’” <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905) Pelagius ought to listen to the
teaching of so eminent a man, and should follow his faith, since he has
commended his teaching and faith. Let him listen humbly; let him follow
with fidelity; let him indulge no longer in obstinate presumption, lest
he perish. Why does Pelagius choose to be sunk in that sea whence Peter
was rescued by the Rock? <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906)

<span id="xv.iii.l-p5"></span> It is impossible to preserve the
paronomasia of the original, which plays on the meaning of the names
*Pelagius* (*pelago*, sea) and *Petrus* (*petra*, rock).
