<span id="xviii.v.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24 \[VIII.\]—There are Three
Principal Heads in the Pelagian Heresy.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xxiv-p2"></span>When, then, the Pelagians are pressed
with these and such like testimonies and words of truth, not to deny
original sin; not to say that the grace of God whereby we are justified
is not given freely, but according to our merits; nor to say that in
mortal man, however holy and well doing, there is so great righteousness
that even after the washing of regeneration, until he finishes this life
of his, forgiveness of sins is not necessary to him,—therefore when they
are pressed not to make these three assertions, and by their means
alienate men who believe them from the grace of the Saviour, and
persuade the lifted-up unto pride to go headlong unto the judgment of
the devil: they introduce the clouds of other questions in which their
impiety—in the sight of men more simpleminded, whether that they are
more slow or less instructed in the sacred writings—may be concealed.
These are the misty questions of the praise of the creature, of the
praise of marriage, of the praise of the law, of the praise of free
will, of the praise of the saints; as if any one of our people were in
the habit of disparaging those things, and not rather of announcing all
things with due praises to the honour of the Creator and Saviour. But
even the creature does not desire in such wise to be praised as to be
unwilling to be healed. And the more marriage is to be praised, the less
is to be attributed to it the shameful concupiscence of the flesh, which
is not of the Father, but of the world; and which assuredly marriage
found and did not make in men; because, moreover, it is actually in very
many without marriage, and if nobody had sinned marriage itself might be
without it. And the law, holy and just and good, is neither grace
itself, nor is anything rightly done by it without grace; because the
law is not given that it may give life, but it was added because of
transgression, that it might conclude all persons convicted under sin,
and that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them
that believe. <span id="fr_2770"></span>[2771](#fn_2770.md) And the free
will taken captive does not avail, except for sin; but for
righteousness, unless divinely set free and aided, it does not avail.
And thus, also, all the saints, whether from that ancient Abel to John
the Baptist, or from the apostles themselves up to this time, and
henceforth even to the end of the world, are to be praised in the Lord,
not in themselves. Because the voice, even of those earlier ones, is,
“In the Lord shall my soul be praised.”  <span
id="fr_2771"></span>[2772](#fn_2771.md) And the voice of the later ones is,
“By the grace of God I am what I am.” <span
id="fr_2772"></span>[2773](#fn_2772.md) And to all belongs, “That he that
glorieth may glory in the Lord.” And it is the common confession of all,
“If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
not in us.” <span id="fr_2773"></span>[2774](#fn_2773.md)
