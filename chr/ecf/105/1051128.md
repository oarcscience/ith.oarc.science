<span id="xxi.iii.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46.—A Man Who Does Not Persevere
Fails by His Own Fault.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xlviii-p2"></span>But it is said, “It is by his own
fault that any one deserts the faith, when he yields and consents to the
temptation which is the cause of his desertion of the faith.” Who denies
it? But because of this, perseverance in the faith is not to be said not
to be a gift of God. For it is this that a man daily asks for when he
says, “Lead us not into temptation;” <span
id="fr_3673"></span>[3674](#fn_3673) and if he is heard, it is this that
he receives. And thus as he daily asks for perseverance, he assuredly
places the hope of his perseverance not in himself, but in God. I,
however, am loth to exaggerate the case with my words, but I rather
leave it to them to consider, and see what it is of which they have
persuaded themselves—to wit, “that by the preaching of predestination,
more of despair than of exhortation is impressed upon the hearers.” For
this is to say that a man then despairs of his salvation when he has
learned to place his hope not in himself, but in God, although the
prophet cries, “Cursed is he who has his hope in man.” <span
