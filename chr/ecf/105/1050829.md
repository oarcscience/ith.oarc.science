id="xviii.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—Secondly, of Marriage.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxx-p2"></span>“We say,” says he, “that that
marriage which is now celebrated throughout the earth was ordained by
God, and that married people are not guilty, but that fornicators and
adulterers are to be condemned.” This is true and catholic doctrine; but
what you want to gather from this, to wit, that from the intercourse of
male and female those who are born derive no sin to be put away by the
laver of regeneration,—this is false and heretical.
