Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xiv.xlviii-p2"></span>The synod said: “Now since we have
received satisfaction on the points which have come before us touching
the monk Pelagius, who has been present; since, too, he gives his
consent to the pious doctrines, and even anathematizes everything that
is contrary to the Church’s faith, we confess him to belong to the
communion of the Catholic Church.”
