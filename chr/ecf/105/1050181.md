<span id="xi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[III.\]—True Grace is the Gift of
the Holy Ghost, Which Kindles in the Soul the Joy and Love of
Goodness.</span>

<span id="xi.viii-p2"></span>We, however, on our side affirm that the
human will is so divinely aided in the pursuit of righteousness, that
(in addition to man’s being created with a free-will, and in addition to
the teaching by which he is instructed how he ought to live) he receives
the Holy Ghost, by whom there is formed in his mind a delight in, and a
love of, that supreme and unchangeable good which is God, even now while
he is still “walking by faith” and not yet “by sight;”  <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) in order that by this gift to him of
the earnest, as it were, of the free gift, he may conceive an ardent
desire to cleave to his Maker, and may burn to enter upon the
participation in that true light, that it may go well with him from Him
to whom he owes his existence. A man’s free-will, indeed, avails for
nothing except to sin, if he <span id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span
id="xi.viii-Page_85"></span>knows not the way of truth; and even after
his duty and his proper aim shall begin to become known to him, unless
he also take delight in and feel a love for it, he neither does his
duty, nor sets about it, nor lives rightly. Now, in order that such a
course may engage our affections, God’s “love is shed abroad in our
hearts,” not through the free-will which arises from ourselves, but
“through the Holy Ghost, which is given to us.” <span
