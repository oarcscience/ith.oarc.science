<span id="x.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[V.\]—He Shows that Cyprian Had Not
Doubted the Original Sin of Infants.</span>

<span id="x.v.x-p2"></span>Accordingly, it is not without reason that
the blessed Cyprian <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) carefully
shows how from the very first the Church has held this as a well
understood article of faith. When he was asserting the fitness of
infants only just born to receive Christ’s baptism, on a certain
occasion when he was consulted whether this ought to be administered
before the eighth day, he endeavoured, as far as he could, to prove that
they were perfect, <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) lest any one
should suppose, from the number of the days (because it was on the
eighth day that infants were before circumcised), that they so far
lacked perfection. However, after bestowing upon them the full support
of his argument, he still confessed that they were not free from
original sin; because if he had denied this, he would have removed all
reason for the very baptism which he was maintaining their fitness to
receive. You can, if you wish, read for yourself the epistle of the
illustrious martyr *On the Baptism of Little Children*; for it cannot
fail to be within reach at Carthage. But I have deemed it right to
transcribe some few statements of it into this letter of mine, so far as
applies to the question before us; and I pray you to mark them
carefully. “Now with respect,” says he, “to the case of infants, whom
you declared it would be improper to baptize if presented within the
second and third day after their birth, since that due regard ought to
be paid to the law of circumcision of old, so that you thought that the
infant should not be baptized and sanctified before the eighth day after
its birth,—a far different view has been formed of the question in our
council. Not a man there assented to what you thought ought to be done;
but the whole of us rather determined that to no one born of men ought
God’s mercy and grace to be denied. For since the Lord in His gospel
says, ‘The Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save
them,’ <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) so far as in us lies, not
a soul ought, if possible, to be lost.” You observe how in these words
he supposes that it is fraught with ruin and death, not only to the
flesh, but also to the soul, for one to depart this life without that
saving sacrament. Wherefore, if he said nothing else, it was competent
to us to conclude from his words that without sin the soul could not
perish. See, however, what (when he shortly afterwards maintains the
innocence of infants) he at the same time allows concerning them in the
plainest terms: “But if,” says he, “anything could hinder men from the
attainment of grace, then their heavier sins might rather hinder those
who have reached the stages of adults, and advanced life, and old age.
Since, however, remission of sins is given even to the greatest sinners
after they have believed, however much they have previously sinned
against God, and since nobody is forbidden baptism and grace, how much
more ought an infant not to be forbidden who newborn has done no sin,
except that from having been born carnally after Adam he has contracted
from his very birth the contagion of the primeval death! How, too, does
this fact contribute in itself the more easily to their reception of the
forgiveness of sins, that the remission which <span id="page_73">p.
73</span> <span id="x.v.x-Page_73"></span>they have is not of their own
sins, but of those of another!”
