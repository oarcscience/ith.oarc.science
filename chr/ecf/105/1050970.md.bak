<span id="xix.iv.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—Love Commended by Our Lord
Himself.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxxvi-p2"></span>Moreover, the Lord Jesus Himself
teaches us that the whole law and the prophets hang upon the two
precepts of love to God and love to our neighbour. Concerning these two
commandments the following is written in the Gospel according to St.
Mark: “And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
together, and perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him:
Which is the first commandment of all? And Jesus answered him: The first
of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel! the Lord our God is one
Lord; and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
strength. <span id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md) This is the first
commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself. <span id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md) There
is none other commandment greater than these.” <span
id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md) Also, in the Gospel according to
St. John, He says, “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one
another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this
shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love to one
another.” <span id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md)
