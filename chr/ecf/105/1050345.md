<span id="xiii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—(9.) The Ninth Breviate.</span>

<span id="xiii.xiii-p2"></span>IX. “The next question we shall require
to be solved,” says he, “is this: By what means is it brought about that
man is with sin?—by the necessity of nature, or by the freedom of
choice? If it is by the necessity of nature, he is blameless; if by the
freedom of choice, then the question arises, from whom he has received
this freedom of choice. No doubt, from God. Well, but that which God
bestows is certainly good. This cannot be gainsaid. On what principle,
then, is a thing proved to be good, if it is more prone to evil than to
good? For it is more prone to evil than to good if by means of it man
can be with sin and cannot be without sin.” The answer is this: It came
by the freedom of choice that man was with sin; but a penal corruption
closely followed thereon, and out of the liberty produced necessity.
Hence the cry of faith to God, “Lead Thou me out of my
necessities.” <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) With these
necessities upon us, we are either unable to understand what we want, or
else (while having the wish) we are not strong enough to accomplish what
we have come to understand. Now it is just liberty itself that is
promised to believers by the Liberator. “If the Son,” says He, “shall
make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) For, vanquished by the sin into
which it fell by its volition, nature has lost liberty. Hence another
scripture says, “For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in bondage.” <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) Since
therefore “the whole need not the physician, but only they that be
sick;” <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) so likewise it is not
the free that need the Deliverer, but only the enslaved. Hence the cry
of joy to Him for deliverance, “Thou hast saved my soul from the straits
of necessity.” <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) For true
liberty is also real health; and this would never have been lost, if the
will had remained good. But because the will has sinned, the hard
necessity <span id="page_162">p. 162</span> <span
id="xiii.xiii-Page_162"></span>of having sin has pursued the sinner;
until his infirmity be wholly healed, and such freedom be regained, that
there must needs be, on the one hand, a permanent will to live happily,
and, on the other hand, a voluntary and happy necessity of living
virtuously, and never sinning.
