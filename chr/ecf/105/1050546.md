<span id="xv.iv.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35 \[XXX.\]—Why the Circumcision of
Infants Was Enjoined Under Pain of So Great a Punishment.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxv-p2"></span>The Scripture does not inform us whether
before Abraham’s time righteous men or their children were marked by any
bodily or visible sign. <span id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999)
Abraham himself, indeed, received the sign of circumcision, a seal of
the righteousness of faith. <span id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000)
And he received it with this accompanying injunction: All the male
infants of his household were from that very time to be circumcised,
while fresh from their mother’s womb, on the eighth day from their
birth; <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001) so that even they who
were not yet able with the heart to believe unto righteousness, should
nevertheless receive the seal of the righteousness of faith. <span
id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span id="xv.iv.xxxv-Page_249"></span>And
this command was imposed with so fearful a sanction, that God said:
“That soul shall be cut off from his people, whose flesh of his foreskin
is not circumcised on the eighth day.” <span
id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002) If inquiry be made into the justice
of so terrible a penalty, will not the entire argument of these men
about free will, and the laudable soundness and purity of nature,
however cleverly maintained, fall to pieces, struck down and fractured
to atoms? For, pray tell me, what evil has an infant committed of his
own will, that, for the negligence of another in not circumcising him,
he himself must be condemned, and with so severe a condemnation, that
that soul must be cut off from his people? It was not of any temporal
death that this fear was inflicted, since of righteous persons, when
they died, it used rather to be said, “And he was gathered unto his
people;” <span id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003) or, “He was gathered
to his fathers:” <span id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004) for no
attempt to separate a man from his people is long formidable to him,
when his own people is itself the people of God.
