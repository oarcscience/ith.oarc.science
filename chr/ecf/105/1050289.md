<span id="xii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42 \[XXXVI.\]—The Blessed Virgin Mary
May Have Lived Without Sin. None of the Saints Besides Her Without
Sin.</span>

<span id="xii.xlvi-p2"></span>He then enumerates those “who not only
lived without sin, but are described as having led holy lives,—Abel,
Enoch, Melchizedek, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joshua the son of Nun,
Phinehas, Samuel, Nathan, Elijah, Joseph, Elisha, Micaiah, Daniel,
Hananiah, Azariah, Mishael, Mordecai, Simeon, Joseph to whom the Virgin
Mary was espoused, John.” And he adds the names of some women,—“Deborah,
Anna the mother of Samuel, Judith, Esther, the other Anna, daughter of
Phanuel, Elisabeth, and also the mother of our Lord and Saviour, for of
her,” he says, “we must needs allow that her piety had no sin in it.” We
must except the holy Virgin Mary, concerning whom I wish to raise no
question when it touches the subject of sins, out of honour to the Lord;
for from Him we know what abundance of grace for overcoming sin in every
particular was conferred upon her who had the merit to conceive and bear
Him who undoubtedly had no sin. <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234) Well, then, if, with this exception
of the Virgin, we could only assemble together all the forementioned
holy men and women, and ask them whether they lived without sin whilst
they were in this life, what can we suppose would be their answer? Would
it be in the language of our author, or in the words of the Apostle
John? I put it to you, whether, on having such a question submitted to
them, however excellent might have been their sanctity in this body,
they would not have exclaimed with one voice: “If we say we have no sin,
we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?” <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235) But perhaps this their answer would
have been more humble than true! Well, but our author has already
determined, and rightly determined, “not to place the praise of humility
on the side of falsehood.” If, therefore, they spoke the truth in giving
such an answer, they would have sin, and since they humbly acknowledged
it, the truth would be in them; but if they lied in their answer, they
would still have sin, because the truth would not be in them.
