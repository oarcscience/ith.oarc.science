<span id="x.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Baptized Infants, of the
Faithful; Unbaptized, of the Lost.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>Hence also that other statement: “The
Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. He that
believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; while he that believeth not
the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) Now in which of these classes must we
place infants—amongst those who believe on the Son, or amongst those who
believe not the Son? In neither, say some, because, as they are not yet
able to believe, so must they not be deemed unbelievers. This, however,
the rule of the Church does not indicate, for it joins baptized infants
to the number of the faithful. Now if they who are baptized are, by
virtue of the excellence and administration of so great a sacrament,
nevertheless reckoned in the number of the faithful, although by their
own heart and mouth they do not literally perform what appertains to the
action of faith and confession; surely they who have lacked the
sacrament must be classed amongst those who do not believe on the Son,
and therefore, if they shall depart this life without this grace, they
will have to encounter what is written concerning such—they shall not
have life, but the wrath of God abideth on them. Whence could this
result to those who clearly have no sins of their own, if they are not
held to be obnoxious to original sin?
