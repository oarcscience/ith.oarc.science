<span id="x.iii.lxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 61 \[XXXII.\]—The Serpent Lifted Up
in the Wilderness Prefigured Christ Suspended on the Cross; Even Infants
Themselves Poisoned by the Serpent’s Bite.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lxi-p2"></span>And since this great and wonderful
dignity can only be attained by the remission of sins, He goes on to
say, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in Him should not
perish, but have eternal life.” <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427)
We know what at that time happened in the wilderness. Many were dying of
the bite of serpents: the people then confessed their sins, and, through
Moses, besought the Lord to take away from them this poison;
accordingly, Moses, at the Lord’s command, lifted up a brazen serpent in
the wilderness, and admonished the people that every one who had been
serpent-bitten should look upon the uplifted figure. When they did so
they were immediately healed. <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428)
What means the uplifted serpent but the death of Christ, by that mode of
expressing a sign, whereby the thing which is effected is signified by
that which effects it? Now death came by the serpent, which persuaded
man to commit the sin, by which he deserved to die. The Lord, however,
transferred to His own flesh not sin, as the poison of the serpent, but
He did transfer to it death, that the penalty without the fault might
transpire in the likeness of sinful flesh, whence, in the sinful flesh,
both the fault might be removed and the penalty. As, therefore, it then
came to pass that whoever looked at the raised serpent was both healed
of the poison and freed from death, so also now, whosoever is conformed
to the likeness of the death of Christ by faith in Him and His baptism,
is freed both from sin by justification, and from death by resurrection.
For this <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span
id="x.iii.lxi-Page_40"></span>is what He says: “That whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.” <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429) What necessity then could there be for
an infant’s being conformed to the death of Christ by baptism, if he
were not altogether poisoned by the bite of the serpent?
