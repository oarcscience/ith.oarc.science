<span id="xvii.iv.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XVIII.\]—The Sixth Passage of
Scripture Quoted by Victor.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxix-p2"></span>Let us now look at the quotation from
Genesis, where the woman was created out of the side of the man, and was
brought to him, and he said: “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of
my flesh.” Our opponent thinks that “Adam ought to have said, ‘Soul of
my soul, or spirit of my spirit,’ if this, too, had been derived from
him.” But, in fact, they who maintain the opinion of the propagation of
souls feel that they possess a more impregnable defence of their
position in the fact that in the Scripture narrative which informs us
that God took a rib out of the man’s side and formed it into a woman, it
is not added that He breathed into her face the breath of life; for this
reason, as they say, because she had already been ensouled <span
id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) from the man. If, indeed, she had
not, they say, the sacred Scripture would certainly not have kept us in
ignorance of the circumstance. With regard to the fact that Adam says,
“This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh,” <span
id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md) without adding, Spirit or soul,
from my spirit or soul, they may answer, just as it has been already
shown, that the expression, “my flesh and bone,” may be understood as
indicating the whole by a part, only that the portion that was taken out
of man was not dead, but ensouled; <span
id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md) for no good ground for denying that
the Almighty was able to do all this is furnished by the circumstance
that not a human being could be found capable of cutting off a part of a
man’s flesh along with the soul. Adam went on, however, to say, “She
shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.” <span
id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md) Now, why does he not rather say
(and thus confirm the opinion of our opponents), “Since her flesh was
taken out of man”? As the case stands, indeed, they who hold the
opposite view may well contend, from the fact that it is written, not
woman’s flesh, but the woman herself was taken out of man, that she must
be considered in her entire nature endued with soul and spirit. For
although the soul is undistinguished by sex, yet when women are
mentioned it is not necessary to regard them apart from the soul. On no
other principle would they be thus admonished with respect to
self-adornment. “Not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly
array; but which (says the apostle) becometh women professing godliness
with a good conversation.” <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md)
Now, “godliness,” of course, is an inner principle in the soul or
spirit; and yet they are called women, although the ornamentation
concerns that internal portion of their nature which has no sex.
