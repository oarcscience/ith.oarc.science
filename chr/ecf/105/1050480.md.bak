<span id="xv.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25 \[XXIV.\]—God by His Wonderful
Power Works in Our Hearts Good Dispositions of Our Will.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxv-p2"></span>Now I want him to tell us whether that
king of Assyria, <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md) whose holy
wife Esther “abhorred his bed,” <span
id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) whilst sitting upon the throne of
his kingdom, and clothed in all his glorious apparel, adorned all over
with gold and precious stones, and dreadful in his majesty when he
raised his face, which was inflamed with anger, in the midst of his
splendour, and beheld her, with the glare of a wild bull in the
fierceness of his indignation; and the queen was afraid, and her colour
changed as she fainted, and she bowed herself upon the head of the maid
that went before her;  <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md) —I
want him to tell us whether this king had yet “hastened to the Lord, and
had desired to be directed by Him, and had subordinated his own will to
His, and had, by cleaving fast to God, become one spirit with Him,
simply by the force of his own free will.” Had he surrendered himself
wholly to God, and entirely mortified his own will, and placed his heart
in the hand of God? I suppose that anybody who should think this of the
king, in the state he was then in, would be not foolish only, but even
mad. And yet God converted him, and turned his indignation into
gentleness. Who, however, can fail to see how much greater a task it is
to change and turn wrath completely into gentleness, than to bend the
heart to something, when it is not <span id="page_226">p. 226</span>
<span id="xv.iii.xxv-Page_226"></span>preoccupied with either affection,
but is indifferently poised between the two? Let them therefore read and
understand, observe and acknowledge, that it is not by law and teaching
uttering their lessons from without, but by a secret, wonderful, and
ineffable power operating within, that God works in men’s hearts not
only revelations of the truth, but also good dispositions of the will.
