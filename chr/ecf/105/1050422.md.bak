id="xiv.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37—The Same Continued. John, Bishop of
Jerusalem, and His Examination.</span>

<span id="xiv.xli-p2"></span>With great propriety, as the proceedings
show, did John, the holy overseer of the Church of Jerusalem, employ the
authority of this same passage of the apostle, as he himself told our
brethren the bishops who were his assessors at that trial, on their
asking him what proceedings had taken place before him previous to the
trial. <span id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md) He told them that “on
the occasion in question, whilst some were whispering, and remarking on
Pelagius’ statement, that ‘without God’s grace man was able to attain
perfection’ (that is, as he had previously expressed it, ‘man was able
to be without sin’), he censured the statement, and reminded them
besides, that even the Apostle Paul, after so many labours—not indeed in
his own strength, but by the grace of God—said: ‘I laboured more
abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God that was with
me;’ <span id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728.md) and again: ‘It is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy;’ <span id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) and again: ‘Except
the Lord build the house, they labour but in vain who build it.’ <span
id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730.md) And,” he added, “we quoted several
other like passages out of the Holy Scriptures. When, however, they did
not receive the quotations which we made out of the Holy Scriptures, but
continued their murmuring noise, Pelagius said: ‘This is what I also
believe; let him be anathema, who declares that a man is able, without
God’s help, to arrive at the perfection of all virtues.’”
