<span id="xi.lxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 64 \[XXXVI.\]—When the Commandment to
Love is Fulfilled.</span>

<span id="xi.lxvii-p2"></span>But somebody will perhaps think that we
lack nothing for the knowledge of righteousness, since the Lord, when He
summarily and briefly expounded His word on earth, informed us that the
whole law and the prophets depend on two commandments; <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) nor was He silent as to what these
were, but declared them in the plainest words: “Thou shall love,” said
He, “the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy mind;” and “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.” <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) What is more surely
true than that, if these be fulfilled, all righteousness is fulfilled?
But the man who sets his mind on this truth must also carefully attend
to another,—in how many things we all of us offend, <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) while we suppose that what we do is
pleasant, or, at all events, not unpleasing, to God whom we love; and
afterwards, having (through His inspired word, or else by being warned
in some clear and certain way) learned what is not pleasing to Him, we
pray to Him that He would forgive us on our repentance. The life of man
is full of examples of this. But whence comes it that we fall short of
knowing what is pleasing to Him, if it be not that He is to that extent
unknown to us? “For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to
face.” <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) Who, however, can make
so bold, on arriving far enough, to say: “Then shall I know even as also
I am known,” <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) as to think that
they who shall see God will have no greater love towards Him than they
have who now believe in Him? or that the one ought to be compared to the
other, as if they were very near to each other? Now, if love increases
just in proportion as our knowledge of its object becomes more intimate,
of course we ought to believe that there is as much wanting now to the
fulfilment of righteousness as there is defective in our love of it. A
thing may indeed be known or believed, and yet not loved; but it is an
impossibility that a thing can be loved which is neither known nor
believed. But if the saints, in the exercise of their faith, could
arrive at that great love, than which (as the Lord Himself testified) no
greater can possibly be exhibited in the present life,—even to lay down
their lives for the faith, or for their brethren, <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) —then after their pilgrimage here,
in which their walk is by “faith,” when they shall have reached the
“sight” of that final happiness <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) which we hope for, though as yet we
see it not, and wait for in patience, <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) then undoubtedly love itself shall
be not only greater than that which we here experience, but far higher
than all which we ask or think; <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) and yet it cannot be possibly more
than “with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our mind.”
For there remains in us nothing which can be added to the whole; since,
if anything did remain, there would not be the whole. Therefore the
first commandment about righteousness, which bids us love the Lord with
all our heart, and soul, and mind <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) (the next to which is, that we love
our neighbour as ourselves), we shall completely fulfil in that life
when we shall see face to face. <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) But even now this commandment is
enjoined upon us, that we may be reminded what we ought by faith to
require, and what we should in our hope look forward to, and,
“forgetting the things which are behind, reach forth to the things which
are before.” <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) And thus, as it
appears to me, that man has made a far advance, even in the present
life, in the righteousness which is to be perfected hereafter, who has
discovered by this very advance how very far removed he is from the
completion of righteousness.
