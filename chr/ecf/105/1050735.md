<span id="xvii.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[III.\]—He Enumerates the Errors
Which He Desires to Have Amended in the Books of Vincentius Victor. The
First Error.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.iii-p2"></span>If you ask me what the particular
errors are, you may read what I have written to our brethren, that
servant of God Renatus, and the presbyter Peter, to the latter of whom
you yourself thought it necessary to write the very works of which we
are now treating, “in obedience,” as you allege, “to his own wish and
request.” Now, they will, I doubt not, lend you my treatises for your
perusal if you should like it, and even press them upon your attention
without being asked. But be that as it may, I will not miss this present
opportunity of informing you what amendments I desire to have made in
these writings of yours, as well as in your belief. The first is, that
you will have it that “The soul was not so made by God that He made it
out of nothing, but out of His own very self.” <span
id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) Here you do not reflect what the
necessary conclusion is, that the soul must be of the nature of God; and
you know very well, of course, how impious such an opinion is. Now, to
avoid such impiety as this, you ought so to say that God is the Author
of the soul as that it was made by Him, but not of Him. For whatever is
of Him (as, for instance, His only-begotten Son) is of the self-same
nature as Himself. But, that the soul might not be of the same nature as
its Creator, it was made by Him, but not of Him. Or, then, tell me
whence it is, or else confess that it is of nothing. What do you mean by
that expression of yours, “That it is a certain particle of an
exhalation from the nature of God”? Do you mean to say, then, that the
exhalation <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) itself from the
nature of God, to which the particle in question belongs, is not of the
same nature as God is Himself? If this be your meaning, then God made
out of nothing that exhalation of which you will have the soul to be a
particle. Or, if not out of nothing, pray tell me of what God made it?
If He made it out of Himself, <span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="xvii.vi.iii-Page_345"></span>it follows that He is Himself (what
should never be affirmed) the material of which His own work is formed.
But you go on to say: “When however, He made the exhalation or breath
out of Himself, He remained at the same time whole and entire;” just as
if the light of a candle did not also remain entire when another candle
is lighted from it, and yet be of the same nature, and not another.
