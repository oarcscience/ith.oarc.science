<span id="xvi.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[VI.\]—Man’s Disobedience Justly
Requited in the Rebellion of His Own Flesh; The Blush of Shame for the
Disobedient Members of the Body.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.vii-p2"></span>When the first man transgressed the law
of God, he began to have another law in his members which was repugnant
to the law of his mind, and he felt the evil of his own disobedience
when he experienced in the disobedience of his flesh a most righteous
retribution recoiling on himself. Such, then, was “the opening of his
eyes” which the serpent had promised him in his temptation <span
id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md) —the knowledge, in fact, of
something which he had better been ignorant of. Then, indeed, did man
perceive within himself what he had done; then did he distinguish evil
from good,—not by avoiding it, but by enduring it. For it certainly was
not just that obedience should be rendered by his servant, that is, his
body, to him, who had not obeyed his own Lord. Well, then, how
significant is the fact that the eyes, and lips, and tongue, and hands,
and feet, and the bending of back, and neck, and sides, are all placed
within our power—to be applied to such operations as are suitable to
them, when we have a body free from impediments and in a sound state of
health; but when it must come to man’s great function of the procreation
of children the members which were expressly created for this purpose
will not obey the direction of the will, but lust has to be waited for
to set these members in motion, as if it had legal right over them, and
sometimes it refuses to act when the mind wills, while often it acts
against its will! Must not this bring the blush of shame over the
freedom of the human will, that by its contempt of God, its own
Commander, it has lost all proper command for itself over its own
members? Now, wherein could be found a more fitting demonstration of the
just depravation of human nature by reason of its disobedience, than in
the disobedience of those parts whence nature herself derives
subsistence by succession? For it is by an especial propriety that those
parts of the body are designated as *natural*. This, then, was the
reason why the first human pair, on experiencing in the flesh that
motion which was indecent because disobedient, and on feeling the shame
of their nakedness, covered these offending members with
fig-leaves; <span id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082.md) in order that, at
the very least, by the will of the ashamed offenders, a veil might be
thrown over that which was put into motion without the will of those who
wished it: and since shame arose from what indecently pleased, decency
might be attained by concealment.
