<span id="x.iv.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56.—The Case of David, in
Illustration.</span>

<span id="x.iv.lvi-p2"></span>Some such thought has occurred to us about
the patriarch David, in the Book of Kings. After the prophet was sent to
him, and threatened him with the evils which were to arise from the
anger of God on account of the sin which he had committed, he obtained
pardon by the confession of his sin, and the prophet replied that the
shame and crime had been remitted to him; but yet, for all that, the
evils with which God had threatened him followed in due course, so that
he was brought low by his son. Now why is not an objection at once
raised here: “If it was on account of his sin that God threatened him,
why, when the sin was forgiven, did He fulfil His threat?” except
because, if the cavil had been raised, it would have been most correctly
answered, that the remission of the sin was given that the man <span
id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span id="x.iv.lvi-Page_67"></span>might not
be hindered from gaining the life eternal, but the threatened evil was
still carried into effect, in order that the man’s piety might be
exercised and approved in the lowly condition to which he was reduced.
Thus also God has both inflicted on man the death of his body, because
of his sin, and, after his sins are forgiven, has not released him in
order that he may be exercised in righteousness.
