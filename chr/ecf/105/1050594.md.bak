id="xvi.v.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XXVI.\]—How Concupiscence
Remains in the Baptized in Act, When It Has Passed Away as to Its
Guilt.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxix-p2"></span>In the case, then, of those persons who
are born again in Christ, when they receive an entire remission of all
their sins, it is of course necessary that the guilt also of the still
indwelling concupiscence should be remitted, in order that (as I said)
it should not be imputed to them for sin. For even as in the case of
those sins which cannot be themselves permanent, since they pass away as
soon as they are committed, the guilt yet is permanent, and (if not
remitted) will remain for evermore; so, when the concupiscence is
remitted, the guilt of it also is taken away. For not to have sin means
this, not to be deemed guilty of sin. If a man have (for example)
committed adultery, though he do not repeat the sin, he is held to be
guilty of adultery until the indulgence in guilt be itself remitted. He
has the sin, therefore, remaining, although the particular act of his
sin no longer exists, since it has passed away along with the time when
it was committed. For if to desist from sinning were the same thing as
not to have sins, it would be sufficient if Scripture were content to
give us the simple warning, “My son, hast thou sinned? Do so no
more.” <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155.md) This, however, does
not suffice, for it goes on to say, “Ask forgiveness for thy former
sins.” <span id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156.md) Sins remain,
therefore, if they are not forgiven. But how do they remain if they are
passed away? Only thus, they have passed away in their *act*, but they
are permanent in their *guilt*. Contrari<span id="page_276">p.
276</span> <span id="xvi.v.xxix-Page_276"></span>wise, then, may it
happen that a thing may remain in act, but pass away in guilt.
