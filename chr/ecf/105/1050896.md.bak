<span id="xviii.vi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[III.\]—The Catholics Praise
Nature, Marriage, Law, Free Will, and the Saints, in Such Wise as to
Condemn as Well Pelagians as Manicheans.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.iii-p2"></span>Let every one who, with a catholic
mind, shudders at these impious and damnable doctrines, in this
tripartite division, shun the lurking-places and snares of this fivefold
error, and be so careful between one and another as in such wise to
decline from the Manicheans as not to incline to the Pelagians; and
again, so to separate himself from the Pelagians as not to associate
himself with the Manicheans; or, if he should already be taken hold of
in one or the other bondage, that he should not so pluck himself out of
the hands of either as to rush into those of the other. Because they
seem to be contrary to one another; since the Manicheans manifest
themselves by vituperating these five points, and the Pelagians conceal
themselves by praising them. Wherefore he condemns and shuns both,
whoever he may be, who according to the rule of the catholic faith so
glorifies the Creator in men, that are born of the good creature of
flesh and soul (for this the Manichean <span id="page_418">p. 418</span>
<span id="xviii.vi.iii-Page_418"></span>will not have), as that he yet
confesses that on account of the corruption which has passed over into
them by the sin of the first man, even infants need a Saviour (for this
the Pelagian will not have). He who so distinguishes the evil of
shameful concupiscence from the blessing of marriage, as neither, like
the Manicheans, to reproach the source of our birth, nor, like the
Pelagians, to praise the source of our disorder. He who so maintains the
law to have been given holy and just and good through Moses by a holy
and just and good God (which Manicheus, in opposition to the apostle,
denies), as to say that it both shows forth sin and yet does not take it
away, and commands righteousness which yet it does not give (which,
again, in opposition to the apostle, Pelagius denies). He who so asserts
free will as to say that the evil of both angel and man began, not from
I know not what nature always evil, which is no nature, but from the
will itself, which overturns Manichean heresy, and nevertheless that
even thus the captive will cannot breathe into a wholesome liberty save
by God’s grace, which overturns the Pelagian heresy. He who so praises
in God the holy men of God, not only after Christ manifested in the
flesh and subsequently, but even those of the former times, whom the
Manicheans dare to blaspheme, as yet to believe their own confessions
concerning themselves, more than the lies of the Pelagians. For the word
of the saints is, “If we should say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” <span
