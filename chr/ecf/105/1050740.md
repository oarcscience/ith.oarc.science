<span id="xvii.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8 \[VI.\]—Victor’s Second Error.
(See Above in Book I. 26 \[XVI.\].)</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.viii-p2"></span>Do not, I pray you, believe, say, or
teach that “Thus is God ever giving souls through infinite time, just as
He who gives is Himself ever <span id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span
id="xvii.vi.viii-Page_347"></span>existent,” if you wish to be a
catholic. For a time will come when God will not give souls, although He
will not therefore Himself cease to exist. Your phrase, “is ever
giving,” might be understood “to give without cessation,” so long as men
are born and get offspring, even as it is said of certain men that they
are “ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of the
truth.” <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) For this term “ever”
is not in this passage taken to mean “never ceasing to learn,” inasmuch
as they do cease to learn when they have ceased to exist in this body,
or have begun to suffer the fiery pains of hell. You, however, did not
allow your word to be understood in this sense when you said “is ever
giving,” since you thought that it must be applied to infinite time. And
even this was a small matter; for, as if you had been asked to explain
your phrase, “ever giving,” more explicitly, you went on to say, “just
as He is Himself ever existent who gives.” This assertion the sound and
catholic faith utterly condemns. For be it far from us to believe that
God is ever giving souls, just as He is Himself, who gives them, ever
existent. He is Himself ever existent in such a sense as never to cease
to exist; souls, however, He will not be ever giving; but He will beyond
doubt cease to give them when the age of generation ceases, and children
are no longer born to whom they are to be given.
