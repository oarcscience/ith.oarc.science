<span id="xvi.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[XI.\]—Marriage Does Not Cancel a
Mutual Vow of Continence; There Was True Wedlock Between Mary and
Joseph; In What Way Joseph Was the Father of Christ.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xii-p2"></span>But God forbid that the nuptial bond
should be regarded as broken between those who have by mutual consent
agreed to observe a perpetual abstinence from the use of carnal
concupiscence. Nay, it will be only a firmer one, whereby they have
exchanged pledges together, which will have to be kept by an especial
endearment and concord,—not by the voluptuous links of bodies, but by
the voluntary affections of souls. For it was not deceitfully that the
angel said to Joseph: “Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife.” <span
id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094.md) She is called his wife because of
her first troth of betrothal, although he had had no carnal knowledge of
her, nor was destined to have. The designation of wife was neither
destroyed nor made untrue, where there never had been, nor was meant to
be, any carnal connection. That virgin wife was rather a holier and more
wonderful joy to her husband because of her very pregnancy without man,
with disparity as to the child that was born, without disparity in the
faith they cherished. And because of this conjugal fidelity they are
both deservedly called “parents” <span
id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095.md) of Christ (not only she as His
mother, but he as His father, as being her husband), both having been
such in mind and purpose, though not in the flesh. But while the one was
His father in purpose only, and the other His mother in the flesh also,
they were both of them, for all that, only the parents of His humility,
not of His sublimity; of His weakness, not of His divinity. <span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span id="xvi.v.xii-Page_269"></span>For the
Gospel does not lie, in which one reads, “Both His father and His mother
marvelled at those things which were spoken about Him;” <span
id="fr_2096"></span>[2097](#fn_2096.md) and in another passage, “Now His
parents went to Jerusalem every year;” <span
id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097.md) and again a little afterwards, “His
mother said unto Him, Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us? Behold, Thy
father and I have sought Thee sorrowing.” <span
id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098.md) In order, however, that He might
show them that He had a Father besides them, who begat Him without a
mother, He said to them in answer: “How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye
not that I must be about my Father’s business?” <span
id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099.md) Furthermore, lest He should be
thought to have repudiated them as His parents by what He had just said,
the evangelist at once added: “And they understood not the saying which
He spake unto them; and He went down with them, and came to Nazareth,
and was subject unto them.” <span id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100.md)
Subject to whom but His parents? And who was the subject but Jesus
Christ, “who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
equal with God”? <span id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md) And
wherefore subject to them,who were far beneath the form of God, except
that “He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a
servant,” <span id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md) —the form in which
His parents lived? Now, since she bore Him without his engendering, they
could not surely have both been His parents, of that form of a servant,
if they had not been conjugally united, though without carnal
connection. Accordingly the genealogical series (although both parents
of Christ are mentioned together in the succession) <span
id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md) had to be extended, as it is in
fact, <span id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104.md) down rather to Joseph’s
name, that no wrong might be done, in the case of this marriage, to the
male, and indeed the stronger sex, while at the same time there was
nothing detrimental to truth, since Joseph, no less than Mary, was of
the seed of David, <span id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105.md) of whom it
was foretold that Christ should come.
