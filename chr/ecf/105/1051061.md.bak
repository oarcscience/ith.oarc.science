id="xxi.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25 \[XIII.\]—Possibly the Baptized
Infants Would Have Repented If They Had Lived, and the Unbaptized
Not.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxv-p2"></span>But if, perchance, they say that sins
are re-remitted to penitents, and that those who die in infancy are not
baptized because they are foreknown as not such as would repent if they
should live, while God has foreknown that those who are baptized and die
in infancy would have repented if they had lived, let them observe and
see that if it be so it is not in this case original sins which are
punished in infants that die without baptism, but what would have been
the sins of each one had he lived; and also in baptized infants, that it
is not original sins that are washed away, but their own future sins if
they should live, since they could not sin except in more mature age;
but that some were foreseen as such as would repent, and others as such
as would not repent, therefore some were baptized, and others departed
from this life without baptism. If the Pelagians should dare to say
this, by their denial of original sin they would thus be relieved of the
necessity of seeking, on behalf of infants outside of the kingdom of
God, for some place of I know not what happiness of their own;
especially since they are convinced that they cannot have eternal life
because they have not eaten the flesh nor drank the blood of Christ; and
because in them who have no sin at all, baptism, which is given for the
remission of sins, is falsified. For they would go on to say that there
is no original sin, but that those who as infants are released are
either baptized or not baptized according to their future merits if they
should live, and that according to their future merits they either
receive or do not receive the body and blood of Christ, without which
they absolutely cannot have life; and are baptized for the true
remission of sins although they derived no sins from Adam, because the
sins are remitted unto them concerning which God foreknew that they
would repent. Thus with the greatest ease they would plead and would win
their cause, in which they deny that there is any original sin, and
contend that the grace of God is only given according to our merits. But
that the future merits of men, which merits will never come into
existence are beyond all doubt no merits at all, it is certainly most
easy to see: for this reason even the Pelagians were not able to say
this; and much rather these ought not to say it. For it cannot be said
with what pain I find that they who with us on catholic authority
condemn the error of those heretics, have not seen this, which the
Pelagians themselves have seen to be most false and absurd.
