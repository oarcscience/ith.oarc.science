<span id="xvi.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—In the Marriage of Mary and
Joseph There Were All the Blessings of the Wedded State; All that is
Born of Concubinage is Sinful Flesh.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xiii-p2"></span>The entire good, therefore, of the
nuptial institution was effected in the case of these parents of Christ:
there was offspring, there was faithfulness, there was the bond. <span
id="fr_2106"></span>[2107](#fn_2106) As offspring, we recognise the Lord
Jesus Himself; the fidelity, in that there was no adultery; the
bond, <span id="fr_2107"></span>[2108](#fn_2107) because there was no
divorce. \[XII.\] Only there was no nuptial cohabitation; because He who
was to be without sin, and was sent not in sinful flesh, but in *the
likeness* of sinful flesh, <span id="fr_2108"></span>[2109](#fn_2108)
could not possibly have been made in sinful flesh itself without that
shameful lust of the flesh which comes from sin, and without which He
willed to be born, in order that He might teach us, that every one who
is born of sexual intercourse is in fact sinful flesh, since that alone
which was not born of such intercourse was not sinful flesh.
Nevertheless conjugal intercourse is not in itself sin, when it is had
with the intention of producing children; because the mind’s good-will
leads the ensuing bodily pleasure, instead of following its lead; and
the human choice is not distracted by the yoke of sin pressing upon it,
inasmuch as the blow of the sin is rightly brought back to the purposes
of procreation. This blow has a certain prurient activity which plays
the king in the foul indulgences of adultery, and fornication, and
lasciviousness, and uncleanness; whilst in the indispensable duties of
the marriage state, it exhibits the docility of the slave. In the one
case it is condemned as the shameless effrontery of so violent a master;
in the other, it gets modest praise as the honest service of so
submissive an attendant. This lust, then, is not in itself the good of
the nuptial institution; but it is obscenity in sinful men, a necessity
in procreant parents, the fire of lascivious indulgences, the shame of
nuptial pleasures. Wherefore, then, may not persons remain man and wife
when they cease by mutual consent from cohabitation; seeing that Joseph
and Mary continued such, though they never even began to cohabit?
