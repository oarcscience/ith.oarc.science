<span id="xviii.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 \[IV.\]—Pelagians and Manicheans
on the Praise of the Creature.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.iv-p2"></span>These things being so, what advantage
is it to new heretics, enemies of the cross of Christ and opposers of
divine grace, that they seem sound from the error of the Manicheans, if
they are dying by another pestilence of their own? What advantage is it
to them, that in the praise of the creature they say “that the good God
is the maker of those that are born, by whom all things were made, and
that the children of men are His work,” whom the Manicheans say are the
work of the prince of darkness; when between them both, or among them
both, God’s creation, which is in infants, is perishing? For both of
them refuse to have it delivered by Christ’s flesh and blood,—the one,
because they destroy that very flesh and blood, as if He did not take
upon Him these at all in man or of man; and the other, because they
assert that there is no evil in infants from which they should be
delivered by the sacrament of this flesh and blood. Between them lies
the human creature in infants, with a good origination, with a corrupted
propagation, confessing for its goods a most excellent Creator, seeking
for its evils a most merciful Redeemer, having the Manicheans as
disparagers of its benefits, having the Pelagians as deniers of its
evils, and both as persecutors. And although in infancy there is no
power to speak, yet with its silent look and its hidden weakness it
addresses the impious vanity of both, saying to the one, “Believe that I
am created by Him who creates good things;” and saying to the other,
“Suffer me to be healed by Him who created me.” The Manicheans say,
“There is nothing of this infant save the good soul to be delivered; the
rest,” which belongs not to the good God, but to the prince of darkness,
“is to be rejected.” The Pelagians say, “Certainly there is nothing of
this infant to be delivered, because we have shown the whole to be
safe.” Both lie; but now the accuser of the flesh alone is more bearable
than the praiser, who is convicted of cruelty against the whole. But
neither does the Manichean help the human soul by blaspheming God, the
Author of the entire man; nor does the Pelagian permit the divine grace
to come to the help of human infancy by denying original sin. Therefore
it is by the catholic faith that God has mercy, seeing that by
condemning both mischievous doctrines it comes to the help of the infant
for salvation. It says to the Manicheans, “Hear the apostle crying,
‘Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost in
you?’ <span id="fr_2780"></span>[2781](#fn_2780.md) and believe that the
good God is the Creator of bodies, because the temple of the Holy Ghost
cannot be the work of the prince of darkness.” It says to the Pelagians,
“The infant that you look upon ‘was conceived in iniquity, and in sin
its mother nourished it in the womb.’ <span
id="fr_2781"></span>[2782](#fn_2781.md) Why, as if in defending it as free
from all mischief, do you not permit it to be delivered by mercy? No one
is pure from uncleanness, not even the infant whose life is of one day
upon the earth. <span id="fr_2782"></span>[2783](#fn_2782.md) Allow the
wretched creatures to receive remission of sins, through Him who alone
neither as small nor great could have any sin.”
