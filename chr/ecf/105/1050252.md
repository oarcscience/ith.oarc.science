<span id="xii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[V.\]—It Was a Matter of Justice that
All Should Be Condemned.</span>

<span id="xii.ix-p2"></span>The entire mass, therefore, incurs penalty
and if the deserved punishment of condemnation were rendered to all, it
would without doubt be righteously rendered. They, therefore, who are
delivered therefrom by grace are called, not vessels of their own
merits, but “vessels of mercy.” <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141) But of whose mercy, if not His who
sent Christ Jesus into the world to save sinners, whom He foreknew, and
foreordained, and called, and justified, and glorified? <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142) Now, who could be so madly insane
as to fail to give ineffable thanks to the Mercy which liberates whom it
would? The man who correctly appreciated the whole subject could not
possibly blame the justice of God in wholly condemning all men
whatsoever.
