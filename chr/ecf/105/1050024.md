<span id="x.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[VI.\]—How It is that the Body Dead
Because of Sin.</span>

<span id="x.iii.vi-p2"></span>One wonders that anything is required
clearer than the proof we have given. But we must perhaps be content to
hear this clear illustration gainsaid by the contention, that we must
understand “the dead body” here <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md)
in the sense of the passage where it is said, “Mortify your members
which are upon the earth.” <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) But
it is *because of righteousness* and not because of sin that the body is
in this sense mortified; for it is to do the works of righteousness that
we mortify our bodies which are upon the earth. Or if they suppose that
the phrase, “because of sin,” is added, not that we should understand
“because sin has been committed,” but “in order that sin may not be
committed”—as if it were said, “The body indeed is dead, in order to
prevent the commission of sin:” what then does he mean in the next
clause by adding the words, “because of righteousness,” to the
statement, “The spirit is life?” <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)
For it would have been enough simply to have adjoined “the spirit is
life,” to have secured that we should supply here too, “in order to
prevent the commission of sin;” so that we should thus understand the
two propositions to point to one thing—that both “the body is dead,” and
“the spirit is life,” for the one common purpose of “preventing the
commission of sin.” So likewise if he had merely meant to say, “because
of righteousness,” in the sense of “for the purpose of doing
righteousness,” the two clauses might possibly be referred to this one
purpose—to the effect, that both “the body is dead,” and “the spirit is
life,” “for the purpose of doing righteousness.” But as the passage
actually stands, it declares that “the body is dead because of sin,” and
“the spirit is life because of righteousness,” attributing different
merits to different things—the demerit of sin to the death of the body,
and the merit of righteousness to the life of the spirit. Wherefore if,
as no one can doubt, “the spirit is life because of righteousness,” that
is, as the desert, of righteousness; how ought we, or can we, understand
by the statement, “The body is dead because of sin,” anything else than
that the body is dead as the desert of sin, unless indeed we try to
pervert or wrest the plainest sense of Scripture to our own arbitrary
will? But besides this, additional light is afforded by the words which
follow. For it is with limitation to the present time, when he says,
that on the one hand “the body is dead because of sin,” since, whilst
the body is unrenovated by the resurrection, there remains in it the
desert of sin, that is, the necessity of dying; and on the other hand,
that “the spirit is life because of righteousness,” since,
notwithstanding the fact of our being still burdened with “the body of
this death,” <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) we have already by
the renewal which is begun in our inner man, new aspirations <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) after the righteousness of faith. Yet,
lest man in his ignorance should fail to entertain hope of the
resurrection of the body, he says that the very body which he had just
declared to be “dead because of sin” in this world, will in the next
world be made alive “because of righteousness,”—and that not only in
such a way as to become alive from the dead, but immortal from its
mortality.
