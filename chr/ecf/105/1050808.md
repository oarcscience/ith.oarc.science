<span id="xviii.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[V.\]—Another Calumny of
Julian,—That “It is Said that Marriage is Not Appointed by God.”</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.ix-p2"></span>But now let us see what follows. “They
say also,” he says, “that those marriages which are now celebrated were
not appointed by God, and this is to be read in Augustin’s book, <span
id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543) against which I replied in four
books. And the words of this Augustin our enemies have taken up by way
of hostility to the truth.” To these most calumnious words I see that a
brief answer must be made, because he repeats them afterwards when he
wishes to insinuate what such men as they would say, as if against my
words. On that point, with God’s assistance, I must contend with him as
far as the matter shall seem to demand. Now, therefore, I reply that
marriage was ordained by God both then, when it was said, “Therefore
shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his
wife, and they shall be two in one flesh,” <span
id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544) and now, wherefore it is written,
“A woman is joined to a man by the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545) For nothing else is even now done
than that a man cleave to his wife, and they become two in one flesh.
Because concerning that very marriage which is now contracted, the Lord
was consulted by the Jews whether it was lawful for any cause to put
away a wife. And to the testimony of the law on the occasion mentioned,
He added, “What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.” <span id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546) The Apostle Paul
also applied this witness of the law when he admonished husbands that
their wives should be loved by them. <span
id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547) Away, then, with the notion that in
my book that man should read anything opposed to these divine
testimonies! But either by not understanding, or rather by calumniating,
he seeks to twist what he reads into another meaning. But I wrote my
book, against which he mentions that he replied in four books, after the
condemnation of Pelagius and Cœlestius. And this, I have thought, must
be said, because that man avers that my words had been taken up by his
enemies in hostility to the truth, lest any one should think that these
new heretics were condemned as enemies of the grace of Christ on account
of this book of mine. But in that book is found the defence rather than
the censure of marriage.
