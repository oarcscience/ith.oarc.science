<span id="xiv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Examination of This Point. The
Phrase “Old Testament” Used in Two Senses. The Heir of the Old
Testament. In the Old Testament There Were Heirs of the New
Testament.</span>

<span id="xiv.xviii-p2"></span>Was it therefore without reason that our
brethren were moved by his words to include this charge among the others
against him? Certainly not. The fact is, that the phrase *Old Testament*
is constantly employed in two different ways,—in one, following the
authority of the Holy Scriptures; in the other, following the most
common custom of speech. For the Apostle Paul says, in his Epistle to
the Galatians: “Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not
hear the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bond-maid, the other by a free woman. . . .Which things are an allegory:
for these are the *two testaments*; the one which gendereth to bondage,
which is Agar. For this is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and is conjoined with
the Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children; whereas
the Jerusalem which is above is free, and is the mother of us
all.” <span id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642) Now, inasmuch as the
Old Testament belongs to bondage, whence it is written, “Cast out the
bond-woman and her son, for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir
with my son Isaac,” <span id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643) but the
kingdom of heaven to liberty; what has the kingdom of heaven to do with
the Old Testament? Since, however, as I have already remarked, we are
accustomed, in <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> <span
id="xiv.xviii-Page_189"></span>our ordinary use of words, to designate
all those Scriptures of the law and the prophets which were given
previous to the Lord’s incarnation, and are embraced together by
canonical authority, under the name and title of *the Old Testament*,
what man who is ever so moderately informed in ecclesiastical lore can
be ignorant that the kingdom of heaven could be quite as well promised
in those early Scriptures as even the New Testament itself, to which the
kingdom of heaven belongs? At all events, in those ancient Scriptures it
is most distinctly written: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that
I will consummate a new testament with the house of Israel and with the
house of Jacob; not according to the testament that I made with their
fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to lead them out of
the land of Egypt.” <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644) This was
done on Mount Sinai. But then there had not yet risen the prophet Daniel
to say: “The saints shall receive the kingdom of the Most High.” <span
id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645) For by these words he foretold the
merit not of the Old, but of the New Testament. In the same manner did
the same prophets foretell that Christ Himself would come, in whose
blood the New Testament was consecrated. Of this Testament also the
apostles became the ministers, as the most blessed Paul declares: “He
hath made us able ministers of the New Testament; not in its letter, but
in spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.” <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646) In that testament, however, which
is properly called the Old, and was given on Mount Sinai, only earthly
happiness is expressly promised. Accordingly that land, into which the
nation, after being led through the wilderness, was conducted, is called
the land of promise, wherein peace and royal power, and the gaining of
victories over enemies, and an abundance of children and of fruits of
the ground, and gifts of a similar kind are the promises of the Old
Testament. And these, indeed, are figures of the spiritual blessings
which appertain to the New Testament; but yet the man who lives under
God’s law with those earthly blessings for his sanction, is precisely
the heir of the Old Testament, for just such rewards are promised and
given to him, according to the terms of the Old Testament, as are the
objects of his desire according to the condition of the old man. But
whatever blessings are there figuratively set forth as appertaining to
the New Testament require the new man to give them effect. And no doubt
the great apostle understood perfectly well what he was saying, when he
described the two testaments as capable of the allegorical distinction
of the bond-woman and the free,—attributing the children of the flesh to
the Old, and to the New the children of the promise: “They,” says he,
“which are the children of the flesh, are not the children of God; but
the children of the promise are counted for the seed.” <span
id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647) The children of the flesh, then,
belong to the earthly Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children;
whereas the children of the promise belong to the Jerusalem above, the
free, the mother of us all, eternal in the heavens. <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648) Whence we can easily see who they
are that appertain to the earthly, and who to the heavenly kingdom. But
then the happy persons, who even in that early age were by the grace of
God taught to understand the distinction now set forth, were thereby
made the children of promise, and were accounted in the secret purpose
of God as heirs of the New Testament; although they continued with
perfect fitness to administer the Old Testament to the ancient people of
God, because it was divinely appropriated to that people in God’s
distribution of the times and seasons.
