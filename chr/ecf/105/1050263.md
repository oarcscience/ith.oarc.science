<span id="xii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[XV.\]—Pelagius Corrupts a Passage
of the Apostle James by Adding a Note of Interrogation.</span>

<span id="xii.xx-p2"></span>Now that passage, in which the Apostle James
says: “But the tongue can no man tame,” <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160) does not appear to me to be capable
of the interpretation which he would put upon it, when he expounds it,
“as if it were written by way of reproach; as much as to say: Can no man
then, tame the tongue? As if in a reproachful tone, which would say: You
are able to tame wild beasts; cannot you tame the tongue? As if it were
an easier thing to tame the tongue than to subjugate wild beasts.” I do
not think that this is the meaning of the passage. For, if he had meant
such an opinion as this to be entertained of the facility of taming the
tongue, there would have followed in the sequel of the passage a
comparison of that member with the beasts. As it is, however, it simply
goes on to say: “The tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly
poison,” <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161) —such, of course, as
is more noxious than that of beasts and creeping things. For while the
one destroys the flesh, the other kills the soul. For, “The mouth that
belieth slayeth the soul.” <span id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162) It
is not, therefore, as if this is an easier achievement than the taming
of beasts that St. James pronounced the statement before us, or would
have others utter it; but he rather aims at showing what a great evil in
man his tongue is—so great, indeed, that it cannot be tamed by any man,
although even beasts are tameable by human beings. And he said this, not
with a view to our permitting, through our neglect, the continuance of
so great an evil to ourselves, but in order that we might be induced to
request the help of divine grace for the taming of the tongue. For he
does not say: “None can tame the tongue;” but “*No man*;” in order that,
when it is tamed, we may acknowledge it to be effected by the mercy of
God, the help of God, the grace of God. The soul, therefore, should
endeavour to tame the tongue, and while endeavouring should pray for
assistance; the tongue, too, should beg for the taming of the tongue,—He
being the tamer who said to His disciples: “It is not ye that speak, but
the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.” <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163) Thus, we are warned by the precept
to do this,—namely, to make the attempt, and, failing in our own
strength, to pray for the help of God.
