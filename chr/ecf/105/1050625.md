<span id="xvi.vi.xix-p2"></span>But now, I pray you, look a little more
attentively, and observe how he contrives to find a name wherewith to
cover again what he blushes to unfold. “For,” says he, “Adam begot him
by the power of his members, not by diversity of merits.” Now I confess
I do not understand what he meant by the latter clause, *not by
diversity of merits*; but when he said, “by the power of his members,” I
believe he wished to express what he is ashamed to say openly and
clearly. He preferred to use the phrase, “by the power of his members,”
rather than say, “by the lust of the flesh.” Plainly—even if the thought
did not occur to him—he intimated a something which has an evident
application to the subject. For what is more powerful than a man’s
members, when they are not in due submission to a man’s will? Even if
they be restrained by temperance or continence, their use and control
are not in any man’s power. Adam, then, begat his sons by what our
author calls “the power of his members,” over which, before he begat
them, he blushed, after his sin. If, however, he had never sinned, he
would not have begotten them by the *power*, but in the *obedience*, of
his members. For he would himself have had the *power* to rule them as
subjects to his will, if he, too, by the same will had only submitted
himself as a subject to a more powerful One.
