<span id="xvii.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[XII.\]—Victor Promises to the
Unbaptized Paradise After Their Death, and the Kingdom of Heaven After
Their Resurrection, Although He Admits that This Opposes Christ’s
Statement.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.xvi-p2"></span>But your friend, in comparison with what
he has shown himself to be further on, thus far makes mistakes which one
may somewhat tolerate. He apparently felt some disposition to relent;
not, to be sure, at what he ought to have misgivings about, namely, for
having ventured to assert that original sin is relaxed even in the case
of the unbaptized, and that remission is given to them of all their
sins, so that they are admitted into paradise, that is, to a place of
great happiness, and possess a claim to the happy mansions in our
Father’s house; but he seems to have entertained some regret at having
conceded to them abodes of lesser blessedness outside the kingdom of
heaven. Accordingly he goes on to say, “Or if any one is perhaps
reluctant to believe that paradise is bestowed as a temporary and
provisional gift on the soul of the thief or of Dinocrates (for there
remains for them still, in the resurrection, the reward of the kingdom
of heaven), although that principal passage stands in the way, <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) —‘Except a man be born again of
water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of
God.’ <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) —he may yet hold my
assent as ungrudgingly given to this point; only let him magnify <span
id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) both the aim and the effect of the
divine compassion and fore-knowledge.” These words have I copied, as I
read them in his second book. Well, now, could any one have shown on
this erroneous <span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="xvii.v.xvi-Page_339"></span>point greater boldness, recklessness, or
presumption? He actually quotes and calls attention to the Lord’s
weighty sentence, encloses it in a statement of his own, and then says,
“Although the opinion is opposed to the ‘principal passage,’ ‘Except a
man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into
the kingdom of God;’” he dares then to lift his haughty head in censure
against the Prince’s judgment: “He may yet hold my assent as
ungrudgingly given to this point;” and he explains his point to be, that
the souls of unbaptized persons have a claim to paradise as a temporary
gift; and in this class he mentions the dying thief and Dinocrates, as
if he were prescribing, or rather prejudging, their destination;
moreover, in the resurrection, he will have them transferred to a better
provision, even making them receive the reward of the kingdom of heaven.
“Although,” says he, “this is opposed to the sentence of the Prince.”
Now, do you, my brother, I pray you, seriously consider this question:
What sentence of the Prince shall that man deserve to have passed upon
him, who imposes on any person an assent of his own which runs counter
to the authority of the Prince Himself?
