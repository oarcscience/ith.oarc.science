id="xviii.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—Opposition of the Manichean
and Catholic Dogmas.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>What is it, then, which in their
raging blindness of mind they are now spreading about, <span
id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912.md) <span id="page_434">p. 434</span>
<span id="xviii.vi.xxxiii-Page_434"></span>“that almost throughout the
entire West a dogma not less foolish than impious is taken up;” when by
the mercy of God and by His merciful governance of His Church, the
catholic faith has been so watchful that the dogma, “not less foolish
than wicked,” as of the Manicheans, so also of these heretics, should
not be taken up? So holy and learned catholic men, such as are attested
to be so by the report of the whole Church, praise both God’s creation,
and marriage as ordained by Him, and the law given by Him by means of
the holy Moses, and the free will implanted into man’s nature, and the
holy patriarchs and prophets, with due and fitting proclamation; all
which five things the Manicheans condemn, partly by denying, and partly
also by abominating. Whence it appears that these catholic doctors were
far removed from the notions of the Manicheans, and yet they assert
original sin; they assert God’s grace above free will, as antecedent to
all merit, so as truly to afford a gratuitous divine assistance; they
assert that the saints lived righteously in this flesh, in such wise
that the help of prayer was necessary to them, by which their daily sins
might be forgiven; and that a perfected righteousness which could not
have sin would be in another life the reward of those who should live
righteously here.
