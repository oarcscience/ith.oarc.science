id="xiv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Pelagius’ Reply to the Eighth
Item of Accusation.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p2"></span>But to this objection he replied with a
watchful caution such as the catholic judges no doubt approved. “It
has,” says he, “been asserted by me,—but in such a sense that the Church
is by the laver cleansed from every spot and wrinkle, and in this purity
the Lord wishes her to continue.” Whereupon the synod said: “Of this
also we approve.” And who amongst us denies that in baptism the sins of
all men are remitted, and that all believers come up spotless and pure
from the laver of regeneration? Or what catholic Christian is there who
wishes not, as his Lord also wishes, and as it is meant to be, that the
Church should remain always without spot or wrinkle? For in very deed
God is now in His mercy and truth bringing it about, that His holy
Church should be conducted to that perfect state in which she is to
remain without spot or wrinkle for evermore. But between the laver,
where all past stains and deformities are removed, and the kingdom,
where the Church will remain for ever without any spot or wrinkle, there
is this present intermediate time of prayer, during which her cry must
of necessity be: “Forgive us our debts.” Hence arose the objection
against them for saying that “the Church here on earth is without spot
or wrinkle;” from the doubt whether by this opinion they did not boldly
prohibit that prayer whereby the Church in her present baptized state
entreats day and night for herself the forgiveness of her sins. On the
subject of this intervening period between the remission of sins which
takes place in baptism, and the perpetuity of sinlessness which is to be
in the kingdom of heaven, no proceedings ensued with Pelagius, and no
decision was pronounced by the bishops. Only he thought that some brief
indication ought to be given that he had not expressed himself in the
way which the accusation against him seemed to state. As to his saying,
“This has been asserted by me,—but in such a sense,” what else did he
mean to convey than the idea that he had not in fact expressed himself
in the same manner as he was supposed to have done by his accusers?
That, however, which induced the judges to say that they were satisfied
with his answer was baptism as the means of being washed from our sins;
and the kingdom of heaven, in which the holy Church, which is now in
process of cleansing, shall continue in a sinless state for ever: this
is clear from the evidence, so far as I can form an opinion.
