<span id="xvi.vi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14 \[V.\]—Concupiscence Alone, in
Marriage, is Not of God.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xv-p2"></span>You see the terms of his question to us:
what the devil can find in the sexes to call his own, by reason of which
they should be in his power, who are born of parents of whatsoever kind,
unless they be born again in Christ; he asks us, moreover, whether it is
the difference in the sexes which we ascribe to the devil, or their
union, or their very fruitfulness. We answer, then, nothing of these
qualities, inasmuch as the difference of sex belongs to “the vessels” of
the parents; while the union of the two pertains to the procreation of
children; and their fruitfulness to the blessing pronounced on the
marriage institution. But all these things are of God; yet amongst them
he was unwilling to name that “lust of the flesh, which is not of the
Father, but is of the world;” <span id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225.md)
and “of this world” the devil is said to be “the prince.” <span
id="fr_2226"></span>[2227](#fn_2226.md) Now, the devil found no carnal
concupiscence in the Lord, because the Lord did not come as a man to men
by its means. Accordingly, He says Himself: “The prince of this world
cometh, and findeth nothing in me” <span
id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227.md) —nothing, that is, of sin; neither
that which is derived from birth, nor that which is added during life.
Among all the natural goods of procreation which he mentioned, he was, I
repeat, unwilling to name this particular fact of concupiscence, over
which even marriage blushes, which glories in all these before-mentioned
goods. For why is the especial work of parents withdrawn and hidden even
from the eyes of their children, except that it is impossible for them
to be occupied in laudable procreation without shameful lust? Because of
this it was that even they were ashamed who first covered their
nakedness. <span id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228.md) These portions of
their person were not suggestive of shame before, but deserved to be
commended and praised as the work of God. They put on their covering
when they felt their shame, and they felt their shame when, after their
own disobedience to their Maker, they felt their members disobedient to
themselves. Our quoter of extracts likewise felt ashamed of this
concupiscence. For he mentioned the difference of the sexes; he
mentioned also their union, and he mentioned their fertility; but this
last concomitant of lust he blushed to mention. And no wonder if mere
talkers are ashamed of that which we see parents themselves, so
interested in their function, blush to think of.
