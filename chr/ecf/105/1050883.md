<span id="xviii.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[VII.\]—Their Calumny About
the Fulfilment of Precepts in the Life to Come.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xvii-p2"></span>But who can bear their objecting to
us, “that we say that after the resurrection such is to be our progress,
that there men can begin to fulfil the commands of God, which they would
not here;” since we say that there there will be no sin at all, no
struggle with any desire of sin; as if they themselves would dare to
deny this? That wisdom also and the knowledge of God, is then perfected
in us, and that in the Lord there is such rejoicing that it is a full
and a true security, who will deny, unless he is so averse from the
truth that on this very account he cannot attain unto it? But these
things will not be in precepts, but in reward of those precepts which
should here be observed; the neglect of which precepts, indeed, does not
lead thither to the reward. But here the grace of God gives the desire
of keeping His commandments; and if anything in these commandments is
less perfectly observed, He forgives it on account of what we say in
prayer, as well “Thy will be done,” as “Forgive us our debts.” Here,
then, it is prescribed that we sin not; there, the reward is that we
cannot sin. Here, the precept is that we obey not the desires of sin;
there, the reward that we have no desires of sin. Here, the precept is,
“Understand, ye senseless among the people; and ye fools, be at some
time wise;” <span id="fr_2739"></span>[2740](#fn_2739) there, the reward
is full wisdom and perfect knowledge. “For we see now through a glass in
an enigma,” says the apostle, “but then face to face: now I know in
part; but then I shall know even as also I am known.” <span
id="fr_2740"></span>[2741](#fn_2740) Here, the precept is, “Exult unto
the Lord, our helper,” <span id="fr_2741"></span>[2742](#fn_2741) and,
“Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord;” <span
id="fr_2742"></span>[2743](#fn_2742) there, the reward is to rejoice
with a perfect and unspeakable joy. Lastly, in the precept it is
written, “Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness;”
but in the reward, “Because they shall be filled.” <span
id="fr_2743"></span>[2744](#fn_2743) Whence, I ask, shall they be
filled, except with what they hunger and thirst after? Who, then, is so
abhorrent, not only from the divine perception, but also from the human
perception, as to say that in man there can be such righteousness while
he is hungering and thirsting for it, as there will be when he shall be
filled with it? But when we are hungering and thirsting after
righteousness, if the faith of Christ is watchful in us, what is it to
be believed that we are hungering and thirsting for, save Christ? “For
He is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption; that, as it is written, He that
glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2744"></span>[2745](#fn_2744) And because we only believe on Him
not seeing Him, therefore we thirst and hunger after righteousness. For
as long as we are in the body, we wander from the Lord; for we walk by
faith, not by appearance. But when we shall see Him, and attain
certainly to the appearance, we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable; and
then we shall be filled with righteousness, since now we say to Him with
pious longing, “I shall be satisfied when Thy glory shall be
manifested.”  <span id="fr_2745"></span>[2746](#fn_2745)
