<p><a name="xx.viii-p2"></A>&#8220;Then,&#8221; say they, &#8220;let those who are over us only prescribe to us what we ought to do, and pray for us that we may do it; but let them not rebuke and censure us if we should not do it.&#8221; Certainly let all be done, since the teachers of the churches, the apostles, were in the habit of doing all,&#8212;as well prescribing what things should be done, as rebuking if they were not done, and praying that they might be done. The apostle prescribes, saying, &#8220;Let all your things be done with love.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3254"></A><A HREF="#fn_3254"><FONT SIZE="1">3255</FONT></A>
 He rebukes, saying, &#8220;Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye have judgments among yourselves. For why do ye not rather suffer wrong? Why are ye not rather defrauded? Nay, ye do wrong and defraud; and that, your brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not possess the kingdom of God?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3255"></A><A HREF="#fn_3255"><FONT SIZE="1">3256</FONT></A>
 Let us hear him also praying: &#8220;And the Lord,&#8221; says he, &#8220;multiply you, and make you to abound in love one towards another and towards all men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3256"></A><A HREF="#fn_3256"><FONT SIZE="1">3257</FONT></A>
 He prescribes, that love should be maintained; he rebukes, because love is not maintained; he prays, that love may abound. O man! learn by his precept what you ought to have; learn by his rebuke that it is by your own fault that you have it not; learn by his prayer whence you may receive what you desire to have.</p>
