<span id="xv.iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[XV.\]—We Need Divine Aid in the
Use of Our Powers. Illustration from Sight.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xvi-p2"></span>Now what is the use of his examples, if
they do not really accomplish his own promise of making his meaning
clearer to us; <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md) not, indeed,
that we are bound to admit their sense, but that we may discover more
plainly and openly what is his drift and purpose in using them? “That we
are able,” says he, “to see with our eyes is not of us; but it is of us
that we make a good or a bad use of our sight.” Well, there is an answer
for him in the psalm, in which the psalmist says to God, “Turn Thou away
mine eyes, that they behold not iniquity.” <span
id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822.md) Now although this was said of the
eyes of the mind, it still follows from it, that in respect of our
bodily eyes there is either a good use or a bad use that may be made of
them: not in the literal sense merely of a good sight when the eyes are
sound, and a bad sight when they are bleared, but in the <span
id="page_223">p. 223</span> <span id="xv.iii.xvi-Page_223"></span>moral
sense of a right sight when it is directed towards succouring the
helpless, or a bad sight when its object is the indulgence of lust. For
although both the pauper who is succoured, and the woman who is lusted
after, are seen by these external eyes; it is after all from the inner
eyes that either compassion in the one case or lust in the other
proceeds. How then is it that the prayer is offered to God, “Turn Thou
away mine eyes, that they behold not iniquity”? Or why is that asked for
which lies within our own power, if it be true that God does not assist
the will?
