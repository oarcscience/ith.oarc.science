<span id="xviii.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XIV.\]—Many Without
Crime, None Without Sin.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>All these products of
concupiscence, and the old guilt of concupiscence itself, are put away
by the washing of baptism. And whatever that concupiscence now brings
forth, if they are not those products which are called not only sins,
but even crimes, are purified by that method of daily prayer when we
say, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive,” and by the sincerity of
alms-giving. For no one is so foolish as to say that that precept of our
Lord does not refer to baptized people: “Forgive and it shall be
forgiven you, give and it shall be given you.” <span
id="fr_2592"></span>[2593](#fn_2592.md) But none could rightly be ordained
a minister in the Church if the apostle had said, “If any is without
sin,” where he says, “If any is without crime;” <span
id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593.md) or if he had said, “Having no sin,”
where he says, “Having no crime.” <span
id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594.md) Because many baptized believers are
without crime, but I should say that no one in this life is without
sin,—however much the Pelagians are inflated, and burst asunder in
madness against me because I say this: not because there remains
anything of sin which is not remitted in baptism; but because by us who
remain in the weakness of this life such sins do not cease daily to be
committed, as are daily remitted to those who pray in faith and work in
mercy. This is the soundness of the catholic faith, which the Holy
Spirit everywhere sows,—not the vanity and presumption of spirit of
heretical pravity.
