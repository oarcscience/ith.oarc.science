id="x.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—What Has Thus Far Been Dwelt
On; And What is to Be Treated in This Book.</span>

<span id="x.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="x.iv.i-p2.1"></span>We</span> have, my dearest Marcellinus,
discussed at sufficient length, I think, in the former book the baptism
of infants,—how that it is given to them not only for entrance into the
kingdom of God, but also for attaining salvation and eternal life, which
none can have without the kingdom of God, or without that union with the
Saviour Christ, wherein He has redeemed us by His blood. I undertake in
the present book to discuss and explain the question, Whether there
lives in this world, or has yet lived, or ever will live, any one
without any sin whatever, except “the one Mediator between God and man,
the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all;” <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) —with as much care and ability as He
may Himself vouchsafe to me. And should there occasionally arise in this
discussion, either inevitably or casually from the argument, any
question about the baptism or the sin of infants, I must neither be
surprised nor must I shrink from giving the best answer I can, at such
emergencies, to whatever point challenges my attention.
