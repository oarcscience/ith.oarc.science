id="xvii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—The Simile Reformed in Accordance
with Truth.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.vi-p2"></span>Well, now, you ought to have thought of
all this when you were writing, and not to have brought God before our
eyes in that favourite simile of yours, of inflated and inflateable
bags, breathing forth souls out of some other nature which was already
in existence, just as we ourselves make our breath from the air which
surrounds us; or certainly you should not, in a manner which is really
as diverse from your similitude as it is abundant in impiety, have
represented God as either producing some changeable thing without
injury, indeed, to Himself, but yet out of His own substance; or what is
worse, creating it in such wise as to be Himself the material of His own
work. If, however, we are to employ a similitude drawn from our
breathing which shall suitably illustrate this subject, the following
one is more credible: Just as we, whenever we breathe, make a breath,
not out of our own nature, but, because we are not omnipotent, out of
that air that surrounds us, which we inhale and discharge whenever we
breathe and respire; and the said breath is neither living nor sentient,
although we are ourselves living and sentient; so God can—not, indeed,
out of His own nature, but (as being so omnipotent as to be able to
create whatever He wills) even out of that which has no existence at
all, that is to say, out of nothing—make a breath that is living and
sentient, but evidently mutable, though He be Himself immutable.
