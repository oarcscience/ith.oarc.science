id="xvi.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—Introductory
Statement.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.ii-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xvi.vi.ii-p2.1"></span>I Cannot</span> tell you, dearly loved and
honoured son Valerius, how great is the pleasure which my heart receives
when I hear of your warm and earnest interest in the testimony of the
word of God against the heretics; and this, too, amidst your military
duties and the cares which devolve on you in the eminent position you so
justly occupy, and the pressing functions, moreover, of your political
life. After reading the letter of your Eminence, in which you
acknowledge the book which I dedicated to you, I was roused to write
this also; for you request me to attend to the statement, which my
brother and fellow-bishop Alypius is commissioned to make to me, about
the discussion which is being raised by the heretics over sundry
passages of my book. Not only have I received this information from the
narrative of my said brother, but I have also read the extracts which he
produced, and which you had yourself forwarded to Rome, after his
departure from Ravenna. On discovering the boastful language of our
adversaries, as I could easily do in these extracts, I determined, with
the help of the Lord, to reply to their taunts with all the truthfulness
and scriptural authority that I could command.
