<span id="xi.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50 \[XXIX.\]—Righteousness is the Gift
of God.</span>

<span id="xi.liii-p2"></span>Let no man therefore boast of that which he
seems to possess, as if he had not received it; <span
id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971) nor let him think that he has received
it merely because the external letter of the law has been either
exhibited to him to read, or sounded in his ear for him to hear. For “if
righteousness is by the law, then Christ has died in vain.” <span
id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972) Seeing, however, that if He has not
died in vain, He has ascended up on high, and has led captivity captive,
and has given gifts to men, <span id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973) it
follows that whosoever has, has from this source. But whosoever denies
that he has from Him, either has not, or is in great danger of being
deprived of what he has. <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974) “For it
is one God which justifies the circumcision by faith, and the
uncircumcision through faith;” <span id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975)
in which clauses there is no real difference in the sense, as if the
phrase “*by faith*” meant one thing, and “*through faith*” another, but
only a variety of expression. For in one passage, when speaking of the
Gentiles,—that is, of the uncircumcision,—he says, “The Scripture,
foreseeing that God would justify the heathen *by faith*;” <span
id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976) and again, in another, when speaking
of the circumcision, to which he himself belonged, he says, “We who are
Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is
not justified by the works of the law, but *through faith* in Jesus
Christ, even we believed in Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977) Observe, he says that both the
uncircumcision are justified by <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> <span
id="xi.liii-Page_105"></span>faith, and the circumcision through faith,
if, indeed, the circumcision keep the righteousness of faith. For the
Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to
righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith, <span
id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978) —by obtaining it of God, not by
assuming it of themselves. But Israel, which followed after the law of
righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. And why?
Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works <span
id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979) —in other words, working it out as it
were by themselves, not believing that it is God who works within them.
“For it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do of His own
good pleasure.” <span id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980) And hereby “they
stumbled at the stumbling-stone.” <span
id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981) For what he said, “not by faith, but
as it were by works,” <span id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982) he most
clearly explained in the following words: “They, being ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ
is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth.” <span id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983) Then are we still in
doubt what are those works of the law by which a man is not justified,
if he believes them to be his own works, as it were, without the help
and gift of God, which is “by the faith of Jesus Christ?” And do we
suppose that they are circumcision and the other like ordinances,
because some such things in other passages are read concerning these
sacramental rites too? In this place, however, it is certainly not
circumcision which they wanted to establish as their own righteousness,
because God established this by prescribing it Himself. Nor is it
possible for us to understand this statement, of those works concerning
which the Lord says to them, “Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye
may keep your own tradition;” <span id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984)
because, as the apostle says, Israel, which followed after the law of
righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.” <span
id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985) He did not say, Which followed after
their own traditions, framing them and relying on them. This then is the
sole distinction, that the very precept, “Thou shalt not covet,” <span
id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986) and God’s other good and holy
commandments, they attributed to themselves; whereas, that man may keep
them, God must work in him through faith in Jesus Christ, who is “the
end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.” <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987) That is to say, every one who is
incorporated into Him and made a member of His body, is able, by His
giving the increase within, to work righteousness. It is of such a man’s
works that Christ Himself has said, “Without me ye can do
nothing.” <span id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988)
