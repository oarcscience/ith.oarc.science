<span id="x.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[X.\]—He Reconciles Some Passages
of Scripture.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xii-p2"></span>The statement, therefore, “He that is born
of God sinneth not,” <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) is not
contrary to the passage in which it is declared by those who are born of
God, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us.” <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) For however
complete may be a man’s present hope, and however real may be his
renewal by spiritual regeneration in that part of his nature, he still,
for all that, carries about a body which is corrupt, and which presses
down his soul; and so long as this is the case, one must distinguish
even in the same individual the relation and source of each several
action. Now, I suppose it is not easy to find in God’s Scripture so
weighty a testimony of holiness given of any man as that which is
written of His three servants, Noah, Daniel, and Job, whom the Prophet
Ezekiel describes as the only men able to be delivered from God’s
impending wrath. <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) In these three
men he no doubt prefigures three classes of mankind to be delivered: in
Noah, as I suppose, are represented righteous leaders of nations, by
reason of his government of the ark as a type of the Church; in Daniel,
men who are righteous in continence; in Job, those who are righteous in
wedlock;—to say nothing of any other view of the passage, which it is
unnecessary now to consider. It is, at any rate, clear from this
testimony of the prophet, and from other inspired statements, how
eminent were these worthies in righteousness. Yet no man must be led by
their history to say, for instance, that drunkenness is not sin,
although so good a man was overtaken by it; for we read that Noah was
once drunk, <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) but God forbid that
it should be thought that he was an habitual drunkard.
