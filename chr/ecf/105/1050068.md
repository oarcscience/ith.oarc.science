<span id="x.iii.l-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50.—From the Epistle to the
Hebrews.</span>

<span id="x.iii.l-p2"></span>Although the authority of the Epistle to
the Hebrews is doubted by some, <span id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md)
nevertheless, as I find it sometimes thought by persons, who oppose our
opinion touching the baptism of infants, to contain evidence in favour
of their own views, we shall notice the pointed testimony it bears in
our behalf; and I quote it the more confidently, because of the
authority of the Eastern Churches, which expressly place it amongst the
canonical Scriptures. In its very exordium one thus reads: “God, who at
sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers
by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom
He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds;
who, being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His
person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had
by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
high.” <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) And by and by the writer
says: “For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how
shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?” <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) And again in another passage:
“Forasmuch then,” says he, “as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through
death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to bondage.” <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md)
Again, shortly after, he says: “Wherefore in all things it behoved Him
to be made like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and
faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation
for the sins of the people.” <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) And
in another place he writes: “Let us hold fast our profession. For we
have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
sin.” <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) Again he says: “He hath an
unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore He is able also to save them to the
uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make
intercession for them. For such a High Priest became us, who is holy,
harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
heavens; who needeth not daily (as those high priests) to offer up
sacrifice, first for His own sins, and then for the people’s: for this
He did once, when He offered up Himself.” <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) And once more: “For Christ is not
entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of
the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God
for us: nor yet that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest
entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; (for then
must He often have suffered since the foundation of the world;) but now
once, in the end of the world, hath He appeared to put away sin by the
sacrifice of Himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but
after this the judgment; so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
many: and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time,
without sin, unto salvation.” <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md)

<span id="x.iii.l-p3"></span> Amongst the Latins, as Jerome tells us in
more than one passage (see his *Commentaries*, on <span
id="x.iii.l-p3.1"></span>Isa. vi., viii.; on [Zech.
viii.](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#000.md)<span id="x.iii.l-p3.2"></span>;
on [Matt. xxvi.](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#000.md)<span
id="x.iii.l-p3.3"></span>; also, in his *Catal. Script. Eccles*., c.
xvi. \[ad Paulum\], and lxx. \[ad Gaium\], etc.). The Greeks, however,
held that the epistle was the work of St. Paul. In his *Epistle* cxxix.
\[ad Dardanum\] he thus writes: “We must admit that the epistle written
to the Hebrews is regarded as the Apostle Paul’s, not only by the
churches of the East, but by all church writers who have from the
beginning (*retro*) written in Greek.”—<span class="c16"><span
id="x.iii.l-p3.4"></span>Note of the Benedictine Editor</span>. \[See
Augustin’s *City of God*, xvi. 22 and *Christian Doctrine*, ii. (8), 13.
The matter is fairly stated by Augustin, after whose day the Epistle was
not doubted even in the West.—W.\]
