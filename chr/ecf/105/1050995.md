<span id="xx.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[VII.\]—They Who Have Not Received
the Gift of Perseverance, and Have Relapsed into Mortal Sin and Have
Died Therein, Must Righteously Be Condemned.</span>

<span id="xx.xiv-p2"></span>If, then, these things be so, we still
rebuke those, and reasonably rebuke them, who, although they were living
well, have not persevered therein; because they have of their own will
been changed from a good to an evil life, and on that account are worthy
of rebuke; and if rebuke should be of no avail to them, and they should
persevere in their ruined life until death, they are also worthy of
divine condemnation for ever. Neither shall they excuse themselves,
saying,—as now they say, “Wherefore are we rebuked?”—so then, “Wherefore
are we condemned, since indeed, that we might return from good to evil,
we did not receive that perseverance by which we should abide in good?”
They shall by no means deliver themselves by this excuse from righteous
condemnation. For if, according to the word of truth, no one is
delivered from the condemnation which was incurred through Adam except
through the faith of Jesus Christ, and yet from this condemnation they
shall not deliver themselves who shall be able to say that they have not
heard the gospel of Christ, on the ground that “faith cometh by
hearing,” <span id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286.md) how much less shall
they deliver themselves who shall say, “We have not received
perseverance!” For the excuse of those who say, “We have not received
hearing,” seems more equitable than that of those who say, “We have not
received perseverance;” since it may be said, O man, in that which thou
hadst heard and kept, in that thou mightest persevere if thou wouldest;
but in no wise can it be said, That which thou hadst not heard thou
mightest believe if thou wouldest.
