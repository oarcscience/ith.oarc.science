<span id="xi.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46.—How the Passage of the Law Agrees
with that of the Prophet.</span>

<span id="xi.xlix-p2"></span>If therefore the apostle, when he mentioned
that the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the law, and have
the work of the law written in their hearts, <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934.md) intended those to be understood who
believed in Christ,—who do not come to the faith like the Jews, through
a precedent law,—there is no good reason why we should endeavour to
distinguish them from those to whom the Lord by the prophet promises the
new covenant, telling them that He will write His laws in their
hearts, <span id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935.md) inasmuch as they too, by
the grafting which he says had been made of the wild olive, belong to
the self-same olive-tree, <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md) —in
other words, to the same people of God. There is therefore a good
agreement of this passage of the apostle with the words of the prophet
so that belonging to the new testament means having the law of God not
written on tables, but on the heart,—that is, embracing the
righteousness of the law with innermost affection, where faith works by
love. <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) Because it is by faith
that God justifies the Gentiles; and the Scripture foreseeing this,
preached the gospel before to Abraham, saying, “In thy seed shall all
nations be blessed,” <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md) in order
that by this grace of promise the wild olive might be grafted into the
good olive, and believing Gentiles might be made children of Abraham,
“in Abraham’s seed, which is Christ,” <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md) by following the faith of him who,
without receiving the law written on tables, and not yet possessing even
circumcision, “believed God, and it was counted to him for
righteousness.” <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md) Now what the
apostle attributed to Gentiles of this character,—how that “they have
the work of the law written in their hearts;” <span
id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md) must be some such thing as what he
says to the Corinthians: “not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
of the heart.” <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md) For thus do they
become of the house of Israel, when their uncircumcision is accounted
circumcision, by the fact that they do not exhibit the righteousness of
the law by the excis<span id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span
id="xi.xlix-Page_103"></span>ion of the flesh, but keep it by the
charity of the heart. “If,” says he, “the uncircumcision keep the
righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for
circumcision?” <span id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md) And therefore in
the house of the true Israel, in which is no guile, <span
id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md) they are partakers of the new
testament, since God puts His laws into their mind, and writes them in
their hearts with his own finger, the Holy Ghost, by whom is shed abroad
in them the love <span id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md) which is the”
fulfilling of the law.” <span id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md)
