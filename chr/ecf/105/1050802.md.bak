id="xviii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Why He Addresses His Book to
Boniface.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.iii-p2"></span>But these words which I am answering
to their two letters,—the one, to wit, which Julian is said to have sent
to Rome, that by its means, as I believe, he might find or make as many
allies as he could; and the other, which eighteen so-called bishops,
sharers in his error, dared to write to Thessalonica, not to any and
every body, but to the bishop of that place itself, with a view of
tempting him by their craftiness and bringing him over, if it could be
done, to their views;—these words which, as I said, I am writing in
answer to those two letters of theirs in respect of that argument, I
have determined to address especially to your sanctity, not so much for
your learning as for your examination and, if perchance anything should
displease you, for your correction. For my brother intimated to me that
you yourself condescended to give those letters to him, which could not
come into your hands except by the most watchful diligence of my
brethren, your sons. And I thank your most sincere kindness to me that
you have been unwilling that those letters of the enemies of God’s grace
should be hidden from me, seeing that in them you have found my name
calumniously as well as openly expressed. But I hope from my Lord God
that not without the reward which is in heaven do those tear me with
their scurrilous teeth to whom I oppose myself on behalf of the little
ones, that they may not be left for destruction to the deceitful
flatterer Pelagius, but may be presented for deliverance to the truthful
Saviour Christ.
