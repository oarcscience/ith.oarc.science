<span id="x.iv.l-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50 \[XXXI.\]—Why It is that Death Itself
is Not Abolished, Along with Sin, by Baptism.</span>

<span id="x.iv.l-p2"></span>He might, however, have also conferred this
upon believers, that they should not even experience the death of their
body. But if He had done this, there might no doubt have been added a
certain felicity to the flesh, but the fortitude of faith would have
been diminished; for men have such a fear of death, that they would
declare Christians happy, for nothing else than their mere immunity from
dying. And no one would, for the sake of that life which is to be so
happy after death, hasten to the grace of Christ by the power of his
contempt of death itself; but with a view to remove the trouble of
death, would rather resort to a more delicate mode of believing in
Christ. More grace, therefore, than this has He conferred on those who
believe on Him; and a greater gift, undoubtedly, has He vouchsafed to
them! What great matter would it have been for a man, on seeing that
people did not die when they became believers, himself also to believe
that he was not to die? How much greater a thing is it, how much braver,
how much more laudable, so to believe, that although one is sure to die,
he can still hope to live hereafter for evermore! At last, upon some
there will be bestowed this blessing at the last day, that they shall
not feel death itself in sudden change, but shall be caught up along
with the risen in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so shall
they ever live with the Lord. <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md)
And rightly shall it be these who receive this grace, since there will
be no posterity after them to be led to believe, not by the hope of what
they see not, but by the love of what they see. This faith is weak and
nerveless, and must not be called faith at all, inasmuch as faith is
thus defined: “Faith is the firmness of those who hope, <span
id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md) the clear proof of things which they
do not see.” <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) Accordingly, in the
same Epistle to the Hebrews, <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="x.iv.l-Page_65"></span>where this passage occurs, after enumerating
in subsequent sentences certain worthies who pleased God by their faith,
he says: “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
seeing them afar off, and hailing them, and confessing that they were
strangers and pilgrims on the earth.” <span
id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md) And then afterwards he concluded his
eulogy on faith in these words: “And these all, having obtained a good
report through faith, did not indeed receive God’s promises; for they
foresaw better things for us, and that without us they could not
themselves become perfect.” <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628.md) Now
this would be no praise for faith, nor (as I said) would it be faith at
all, were men in believing to follow after rewards which they could
see,—in other words, if on believers were bestowed the reward of
immortality in this present world.
