<span id="xi.iii-p5"></span>————————————

<span id="xi.iii-p6"></span>*Marcellinus, in a letter to Augustin, had
expressed some surprise at having read, in the preceding work, of the
possibility being allowed of a man continuing if he willed it, by God’s
help, without sin in the present life, although not a single human
example anywhere of such perfect righteousness has ever existed.
Augustin takes the opportunity of discussing, in opposition to the
Pelagians, the subject of the aid of God’s grace; and he shows that the
divine help to the working of righteousness by us does not lie in the
fact of God’s having given us a law which is full of good and holy
precepts; but in the fact that our will itself, without which we can do
nothing good, is assisted and elevated by the Spirit of grace being
imparted to us, without the aid of which the teaching of the law is “the
letter that killeth,” because instead of justifying the ungodly, it
rather holds them guilty of transgression. He begins to treat of the
question proposed to him at the commencement of this work, and returns
to it towards its conclusion; he shows that, as all allow, many things
are possible with God’s help, of which there occurs indeed no example;
and then concludes that, although a perfect righteousness is unexampled
among men, it is for all that not impossible.*
