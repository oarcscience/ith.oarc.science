<span id="xxi.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—God Chose the Righteous; Not
Those Whom He Foresaw as Being of Themselves, But Those Whom He
Predestinated for the Purpose of Making So.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxvi-p2"></span>“Therefore,” says the Pelagian, “He
foreknew who would be holy and immaculate by the choice of free will,
and on that account elected them <span id="page_516">p. 516</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.xxxvi-Page_516"></span>before the foundation of the world in
that same foreknowledge of His in which He foreknew that they would be
such. Therefore He elected them,” says he, “before they existed,
predestinating them to be children whom He foreknew to be holy and
immaculate. Certainly He did not make them so; nor did He foresee that
He would make them so, but that they would be so.” Let us, then, look
into the words of the apostle and see whether He chose us before the
foundation of the world because we were going to be holy and immaculate,
or in order that we might be so. “Blessed,” says he, “be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us in all spiritual
blessing in the heavens in Christ; even as He hath chosen us in Himself
before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
unspotted.”  <span id="fr_3529"></span>[3530](#fn_3529.md) Not, then,
because we were to be so, but that we might be so. Assuredly it is
certain,—assuredly it is manifest. Certainly we were to be such for the
reason that He has chosen us, predestinating us to be such by His grace.
Therefore “He blessed us with spiritual blessing in the heavens in
Christ Jesus, even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the
world, that we should be holy and immaculate in His sight, in order that
we might not in so great a benefit of grace glory concerning the good
pleasure of our will. “In which,” says he, “He hath shown us favour in
His beloved Son,”—in which, certainly, His own will, He hath shown us
favour. Thus, it is said, He hath shown us grace by grace, even as it is
said, He has made us righteous by righteousness. “In whom,” he says, “we
have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to
the riches of His grace, which has abounded to us in all wisdom and
prudence; that he might show to us the mystery of His will, according to
His good pleasure.” In this mystery of His will, He placed the riches of
His grace, according to His good pleasure, not according to ours, which
could not possibly be good unless He Himself, according to His own good
pleasure, should aid it to become so. But when he had said, “According
to His good pleasure,” he added, “which He purposed in Him,” that is, in
His beloved Son, “in the dispensation of the fulness of times to restore
all things in Christ, which are in heaven, and which are in earth, in
Him: in whom also we too have obtained a lot, being predestinated
according to His purpose who worketh all things according to the counsel
of His will; that we should be to the praise of His glory.”
