<span id="x.iii.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45.—From the Epistle to the
Galatians.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xlv-p2"></span>Likewise to the Galatians the apostle
writes: “Grace be to you, and peace, from God the Father, and from our
Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver
us from this present evil world.” <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) While in another passage he says to
them: “The law was added because of transgressions, until the seed
should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels
in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator belongs not to one party; but
God is one. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for
if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily
righteousness should have been by the law. But the scripture hath
concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might
be given to them that believe.” <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md)
