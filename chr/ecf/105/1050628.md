<span id="xvi.vi.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[IX.\]—It is the Good God That
Gives Fruitfulness, and the Devil That Corrupts the Fruit.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxii-p2"></span>What, therefore, is this man’s meaning,
in the next passage, wherein he says concerning Noah and his sons, that
“they were blessed, even as Adam and Eve were; for God said unto them,
‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and have dominion over the earth’”? <span
id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) To these words of the Almighty he
added some of his own, saying: “Now that pleasure, which you would have
seem diabolical, was resorted to in the case of the above-mentioned
married pairs; and it continued to exist, both in the goodness of its
institution and in the blessing attached to it. For there can be no
doubt that the following words were addressed to Noah and his sons in
reference to their bodily connection with their wives, which had become
by this time unalterably fixed by use: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and
replenish the earth.’” It is unnecessary for us to employ many words in
repeating our former argument. The point here in question is the
corruption in our nature, whereby its goodness has been depraved, of
which corruption the devil is the author. That goodness of nature, as it
is in itself, the author of which is God, is not the question we have to
consider. Now God has never withdrawn from corrupted and depraved nature
His own mercy and goodness, so as to deprive man of fruitfulness,
vivacity, and health, as well as the very substance of his mind and
body, his senses also and reason, as well as food, and nourishment, and
growth. He, moreover, “maketh His sun to arise on the evil and on the
good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust;” <span
id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) and all that is good in human
nature is from the good God, even in the case of those men who will not
be delivered from evil.
