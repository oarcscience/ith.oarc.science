<span id="x.iii.lx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 60 \[XXXI.\]—Christ, the Head and the
Body; Owing to the Union of the Natures in the Person of Christ, He Both
Remained in Heaven, and Walked About on Earth; How the One Christ Could
Ascend to Heaven; The Head, and the Body, the One Christ.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lx-p2"></span>Now when Nicodemus understood not what was
being told him, he inquired of the Lord how such things could be. Let us
look at what the Lord said to him in answer to his inquiry; for of
course, as He deigns to answer the question, How can these things be? He
will in fact tell us how spiritual regeneration can come to a man who
springs from carnal generation. After noticing briefly the ignorance of
one who assumed a superiority over others as a teacher, and having
blamed the unbelief of all such, for not <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>
<span id="x.iii.lx-Page_39"></span>accepting His witness to the truth,
He went on to inquire and wonder whether, as He had told them about
earthly things and they had not believed they would believe heavenly
things. He nevertheless pursues the subject, and gives an answer such as
others should believe—though these refuse—to the question that he was
asked, How these things can be? “No man,” says He, “hath ascended up to
heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is
in heaven.” <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419) Thus, He says, shall
come the spiritual birth,—men, from being earthly, shall become
heavenly; and this they can only obtain by being made members of me; so
that he may ascend who descended, since no one ascends who did not
descend. All, therefore, who have to be changed and raised must meet
together in a union with Christ, so that the Christ who descended may
ascend, reckoning His body (that is to say, His Church) as nothing else
than Himself, because it is of Christ and the Church that this is most
truly understood: “And they twain shall be one flesh;” <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420) concerning which very subject He
expressly said Himself, “So then they are no more twain, but one
flesh.” <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421) To ascend, therefore,
they would be wholly unable, since “no man hath ascended up to heaven,
but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in
heaven.” <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422) For although it was on
earth that He was made the Son of man, yet He did not deem it unworthy
of that divinity, in which, although remaining in heaven, He came down
to earth, to designate it by the name of the Son of man, as He dignified
His flesh with the name of Son of God: that they might not be regarded
as if they were two Christs,—the one God, the other man, <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423) —but one and the same God and
man,—God, because “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God;” <span id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424) and
man, inasmuch as “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425) By this means—by the difference
between His divinity and His humiliation—He remained in heaven as Son of
God, and as Son of man walked on earth; whilst, by that unity of His
person which made His two natures one Christ, He both walked as Son of
God on earth, and at the same time as the very Son of man remained in
heaven. Faith, therefore, in more credible things arises from the belief
of such things as are more incredible. For if His divine nature, though
a far more distant object, and more sublime in its incomparable
diversity, had ability so to take upon itself the nature of man on our
account as to become one Person, and whilst appearing as Son of man on
earth in the weakness of the flesh, was able to remain all the while in
heaven in the divinity which partook of the flesh, how much easier for
our faith is it to suppose that other men, who are His faithful saints,
become one Christ with the Man Christ, so that, when all ascend by His
grace and fellowship, the one Christ Himself ascends to heaven who came
down from heaven? It is in this sense that the apostle says, “As we have
many members in one body, and all the members of the body, being many,
are one body, so likewise is Christ.” <span
id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426) He did not say, “So also is
Christ’s”—meaning Christ’s body, or Christ’s members—but his words are,
“*So likewise is Christ,*” thus calling the head and body one Christ.
