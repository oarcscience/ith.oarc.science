id="xxi.iii.lxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 68.—Conclusion.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lxx-p2"></span>Let those who read this, if they
understand, give God thanks, and let those who do not understand, pray
that they may have the inward Teacher, from whose presence comes
knowledge and understanding. <span id="fr_3716"></span>[3717](#fn_3716)
But let those who think that I am in error, consider again and again
carefully what is here said, lest perchance they themselves may be
mistaken. And when, by means of those who read my writings, I become not
only wiser, but even more perfect, I acknowledge God’s favour to me; and
this I especially look for at the hands of the teachers of the Church,
if what I write comes into their hands, and they condescend to
acknowledge it.
