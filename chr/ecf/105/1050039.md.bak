<span id="x.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[XVI.\]—Unbaptized Infants
Damned, But Most Lightly; <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) The
Penalty of Adam’s Sin, the Grace of His Body Lost.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxi-p3"></span>It may therefore be correctly affirmed,
that <span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span
id="x.iii.xxi-Page_23"></span>such infants as quit the body without
being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all. That
person, therefore, greatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches
that they will not be involved in condemnation; whereas the apostle
says: “Judgment from one offence to condemnation,” <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) and again a little after: “By the
offence of one upon all persons to condemnation.” <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) When, indeed, Adam sinned by not
obeying God, then his body—although it was a natural and mortal
body—lost the grace whereby it used in every part of it to be obedient
to the soul. Then there arose in men affections common to the brutes
which are productive of shame, and which made man ashamed of his own
nakedness. <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) Then also, by a
certain disease which was conceived in men from a suddenly injected and
pestilential corruption, it was brought about that they lost that
stability of life in which they were created, and, by reason of the
mutations which they experienced in the stages of life, issued at last
in death. However many were the years they lived in their subsequent
life, yet they began to die on the day when they received the law of
death, because they kept verging towards old age. For that possesses not
even a moment’s stability, but glides away without intermission, which
by constant change perceptibly advances to an end which does not produce
perfection, but utter exhaustion. Thus, then, was fulfilled what God had
spoken: “In the day that ye eat thereof, ye shall surely die.” <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) As a consequence, then, of this
disobedience of the flesh and this law of sin and death, whoever is born
of the flesh has need of spiritual regeneration—not only that he may
reach the kingdom of God, but also that he may be freed from the
damnation of sin. Hence men are on the one hand born in the flesh liable
to sin and death from the first Adam, and on the other hand are born
again in baptism associated with the righteousness and eternal life of
the second Adam; even as it is written in the book of Ecclesiasticus:
“Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all
die.” <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) Now whether it be said of
the woman or of Adam, both statements pertain to the first man; since
(as we know) the woman is of the man, and the two are one flesh. Whence
also it is written: “And they twain shall be one flesh; wherefore,” the
Lord says, “they are no more twain, but one flesh.” <span
