<span id="xix.iv.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—God is Able to Convert Opposing
Wills, and to Take Away from the Heart Its Hardness.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxix-p2"></span>Now if faith is simply of free will,
and is not given by God, why do we pray for those who will not believe,
that they may believe? This it would be absolutely useless to do, unless
we believe, with perfect propriety, that Almighty God is able to turn to
belief wills that are perverse and opposed to faith. Man’s free will is
addressed when it is said, “Today, if ye will hear His voice, harden not
your hearts.” <span id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102) But if God were
not able to remove from the human heart even its obstinacy and hardness,
He would not say, through the prophet, “I will take from them their
heart of stone, and will give them a heart of flesh.” <span
id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103) That all this was foretold in
reference to the New Testament is shown clearly enough by the apostle
when he says, “Ye are our epistle, . . . written not with ink, but with
the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly
tables of the heart.” <span id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104) We must
not, of course, suppose that such a phrase as this is used as if those
might live in a fleshly <span id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105) way
who ought to live spiritually; but inasmuch as a stone has no feeling,
with which man’s hard heart is compared, what was there left Him to
compare man’s intelligent heart with but the flesh, which possesses
feeling? For this is what is said by the prophet Ezekiel: “I will give
them another heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will
take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of
flesh; that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and
do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, saith the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106) Now can we possibly,
without extreme absurdity, maintain that there previously existed in any
man the good merit of a good will, to entitle him to the removal of his
stony heart, when all the while this very heart of stone signifies
nothing else than a will of the hardest kind and such as is absolutely
inflexible against God? For <span id="page_456">p. 456</span> <span
id="xix.iv.xxix-Page_456"></span>where a good will precedes, there is,
of course, no longer a heart of stone.
