<span id="xxi.ii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—Old Testament
Testimonies.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xlii-p2"></span>Therefore also it is in vain that
objectors have alleged, that what we have proved by Scripture testimony
from the books of Kings and Chronicles is not pertinent to the subject
of which we are discoursing: <span id="fr_3548"></span>[3549](#fn_3548.md)
such, for instance, as that when God wills that to be done which ought
only to be done by the willing men, their hearts are inclined to will
this,—inclined, that is to say, by His power, who, in a marvellous and
ineffable manner, worketh in us also to will. What else is this than to
say nothing, and yet to contradict? Unless perchance, they have given
some reason to you for the view that they have taken, which reason you
have preferred to say nothing about in your letters. But what that
reason can be I do not know. Whether, possibly, since we have shown that
God has so acted on the hearts of men, and has induced the wills of
those whom He pleased to this point, that Saul or David should be
established as king,—do they not think that these instances are
appropriate to this subject, because to reign in this world temporally
is not the same thing as to reign eternally with God? And so do they
suppose that God inclines the wills of those whom He pleases to the
attainment of earthly kingdoms, but does not incline them to the
attainment of a heavenly kingdom? But I think that it was in reference
to the kingdom of heaven, and not to an earthly kingdom, that it was
said, “Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies;” <span
id="fr_3549"></span>[3550](#fn_3549.md) or, “The steps of a man are ordered
by the Lord, and He will will His way;” <span
id="fr_3550"></span>[3551](#fn_3550.md) or, “The will is prepared by the
Lord;” <span id="fr_3551"></span>[3552](#fn_3551.md) or, “Let our Lord be
with us as with our fathers; let Him not forsake us, nor turn Himself
away from us; let Him incline our hearts unto Him, that we may walk in
all His ways;” <span id="fr_3552"></span>[3553](#fn_3552.md) or, “I will
give them a heart to know me, and ears that hear;” <span
id="fr_3553"></span>[3554](#fn_3553.md) or, “I will give them another
heart, and a new spirit will I give them.” <span
id="fr_3554"></span>[3555](#fn_3554.md) Let them also hear this, “I will
give my Spirit within you, and I will cause you to walk in my
righteousness; and ye shall observe my judgments, and do them.” <span
id="fr_3555"></span>[3556](#fn_3555.md) Let them hear, “Man’s goings are
directed by the Lord, and how can a man understand His ways?” <span
id="fr_3556"></span>[3557](#fn_3556.md) Let them hear, “Every man seemeth
right to himself, but the Lord directeth the hearts.” <span
id="fr_3557"></span>[3558](#fn_3557.md) Let them hear, “As many as were
ordained to eternal life be<span id="page_519">p. 519</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.xlii-Page_519"></span>lieved.” <span
id="fr_3558"></span>[3559](#fn_3558.md) Let them hear these passages, and
whatever others of the kind I have not mentioned in which God is
declared to prepare and to convert men’s wills, even for the kingdom of
heaven and for eternal life. And consider what sort of a thing it is to
believe that God worketh men’s wills for the foundation of earthly
kingdoms, but that men work their own wills for the attainment of the
kingdom of heaven.
