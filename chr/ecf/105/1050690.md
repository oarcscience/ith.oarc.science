<span id="xvii.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—By “Breath” Is Signified
Sometimes the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xviii-p2"></span>How, again, does he know whether the
repetition of the idea in the sentence, “who giveth breath to the people
upon it, and spirit to them that walk over it,” may not be understood of
only one thing under two expressions, and may not mean, not the life or
spirit whereby human nature lives, but the Holy Spirit? For if by the
“breath” the Holy Ghost could not be signified, the Lord would not, when
He “breathed upon” His disciples after His resurrection, have said,
“Receive ye the Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md)
Nor would it have been thus written in the Acts of the Apostles,
“Suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as if a mighty breath were
borne in upon them; and there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as
of fire, and it sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the
Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md) Suppose, now,
that it was this which the prophet foretold in the words, “who giveth
breath unto the people upon it;” and then, as an exposition of what he
had designated “*breath*,” he went on to say, “and spirit to them that
walk over it.” Surely this prediction was most manifestly fulfilled when
they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. If, however, the term
“*people*” is not yet applicable to the one hundred and twenty persons
who were then assembled together in one place, at all events, when the
number of believers amounted to four or five thousand, who when they
were baptized received the Holy Ghost, <span
id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) can any doubt that the recipients
of the Holy Ghost were *then* “the people,” even “the men walking in the
earth”? For that spirit which is given to man as appertaining to his
nature, whether it be given by propagation or be inbreathed as something
new to individuals (and I do not determine which of these two modes
ought to be affirmed, at least until one of the two can be clearly
ascertained beyond a doubt), is not given to men when they “walk over
the earth,” but whilst they are still shut up in their mother’s womb.
“He gave breath, therefore, to the people upon the earth, and spirit to
them that walk over it,” when many became believers together, and were
together filled with the Holy Ghost. And He gives Him to His people,
although not to all at the same time, but to every one in His own time,
until, by departing from this life, and by coming into it, the entire
number of His people <span id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span
id="xvii.iv.xviii-Page_323"></span>be fulfilled. In this passage of Holy
Scripture, therefore, *breath* is not one thing, and *spirit* another
thing; but there is a repetition of one and the same idea. Just as “He
that sitteth in the heavens” is not one, and “the Lord” is not another;
nor, again, is it one thing “to laugh,” and another thing “to hold in
derision;” but there is only a repetition of the same meaning in the
passage where we read, “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the
Lord shall have them in derision.” <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) So, in precisely the same manner,
in the passage, “I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession,” <span
id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) it is certainly not meant that
“inheritance” is one thing, and “possession” another thing; nor that
“the heathen” means one thing, and “the uttermost parts of the earth”
another; there is only a repetition of the self-same thing. He will,
indeed, discover innumerable expressions of this sort in the sacred
writings, if he will only attentively consider what he reads. <span
