id="xii.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51 \[XLIV.\]—State of the Question
Between the Pelagians and the Catholics. Holy Men of Old Saved by the
Self-Same Faith in Christ Which We Exercise.</span>

<span id="xii.lv-p2"></span>But why need we tarry longer on general
statements? Let us go into the core of the question, which we have to
discuss with our opponents solely, or almost entirely, on one particular
point. For inasmuch as he says that “as far as the present question is
concerned, it is not pertinent to inquire whether there have been or now
are any men in this life without sin, but whether they had or have the
ability to be such persons;” so, were I even to allow that there have
been or are any such, I should not by any means therefore affirm that
they had or have the ability, unless justified by the grace of God
through our Lord “Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” <span
id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) For the same faith which healed the
saints of old now heals us,—that is to say, <span id="page_139">p.
139</span> <span id="xii.lv-Page_139"></span>faith “in the one Mediator
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,” <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) —faith in His blood, faith in His
cross, faith in His death and resurrection. As we therefore have the
same spirit of faith, we also believe, and on that account also speak.
