id="xii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 \[IV.\]—Free Grace.</span>

<span id="xii.viii-p2"></span>This grace, however, of Christ, without
which neither infants nor adults can be saved, is not rendered for any
merits, but is given *gratis*, on account of which it is also called
*grace.* “Being justified,” says the apostle, “freely through His
blood.” <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) Whence they, who are
not liberated through grace, either because they are not yet able to
hear, or because they are unwilling to obey; or again because they did
not receive, at the time when they were unable on account of youth to
hear, that bath of regeneration, which they might have received and
through which they might have been saved, are indeed justly condemned;
because they are not without sin, either that which they have derived
from their birth, or that which they have added from their own
misconduct. “For all have sinned”—whether in Adam or in themselves—“and
come short of the glory of God.” <span
