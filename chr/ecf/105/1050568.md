<span id="xvi.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[III.\]—Conjugal Chastity the Gift
of God.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.iii-p2"></span>That chastity in the married state is
God’s gift, is shown by the most blessed Paul, when, speaking on this
very subject, he says: “But I would that all men were even as I myself:
but every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and
another after that.” <span id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065) Observe,
he tells us that this gift is from God; and although he classes it below
that continence in which he would have all men to be like himself, he
still describes it as a gift of God. Whence we understand that, when
these precepts are given to us in order that we should do them, nothing
else is stated than that there ought to be within us our own will also
for receiving and having them. When, therefore, these are shown to be
gifts of God, it is meant that they must be sought from Him if they are
not already possessed; and if they are possessed, thanks must be given
to Him for the possession; moreover, that our own wills have but small
avail for seeking, obtaining, and holding fast these gifts, unless they
be assisted by God’s grace.
