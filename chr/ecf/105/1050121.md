id="x.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—God’s Sovereignity in His
Grace.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>As to the reason why He wills to convert
some, and to punish others for turning away,—although nobody can justly
censure the merciful One in conferring His blessing, nor can any man
justly find fault with the truthful One in awarding His punishment (as
no one could justly blame Him, in the parable of the labourers, for
assigning to some their stipulated hire, and to others unstipulated
largess <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580) .md), yet, after all, the
purpose of His more hidden judgment is in His own power. \[XIX.\] So far
as it has been given us, let us have wisdom, and let us understand that
the good Lord God sometimes withholds even from His saints either the
certain knowledge or the triumphant joy of a good work, just in order
that they may discover that it is not from themselves, but from Him that
they receive the light which illuminates their darkness, and the sweet
grace which causes their land  <span id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581.md)
to yield her fruit.
