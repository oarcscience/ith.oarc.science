<span id="xi.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52 \[XXX.\]—Grace Establishes Free
Will.</span>

<span id="xi.lv-p2"></span>Do we then by grace make void free will? God
forbid! Nay, rather we establish free will. For even as the law by
faith, so free will by grace, is not made void, but established. <span
id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993) For neither is the law fulfilled
except by free will; but by the law is the knowledge of sin, by faith
the acquisition of grace against sin, by grace the healing of the soul
from the disease of sin, by the health of the soul freedom of will, by
free will the love of righteousness, by love of righteousness the
accomplishment of the law. Accordingly, as the law is not made void, but
is established through faith, since faith procures grace whereby the law
is fulfilled; so free will is not made void through grace, but is
established, since grace cures the will whereby righteousness is freely
loved. Now all the stages which I have here connected together in their
successive links, have severally their proper voices in the sacred
Scriptures. The law says: “Thou shall not covet.” <span
id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994) Faith says: “Heal my soul, for I have
sinned against Thee.” <span id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995) Grace
says: “Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come
unto thee.” <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996) Health says: “O Lord
my God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me.” <span
id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997) Free will says: “I will freely
sacrifice unto Thee.” <span id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998) Love of
righteousness says: “Transgressors told me pleasant tales, but not
according to Thy law, O Lord.” <span id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999)
How is it then that miserable men dare to be proud, either of their free
will, before they are freed, or of their own strength, if they have been
freed? They do not observe that in the very mention of free will they
pronounce the name of liberty. But “where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty.” <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000) If,
therefore, they are the slaves of sin, why do they boast of free will?
For by what a man is overcome, to the same is he delivered as a
slave. <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001) But if they have been
freed, why do they vaunt themselves as if it were by their own doing,
and boast, as if they had not received? Or are they free in such sort
that they do not choose to have Him for their Lord who says to them:
“Without me ye can do nothing;” <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002) and “If the Son shall make you
free, ye shall be free indeed?” <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003)
