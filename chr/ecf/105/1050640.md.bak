id="xvi.vi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33 \[XVIII.\]—Though God Makes Us,
We Perish Unless He Re-makes Us in Christ.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxxiv-p2"></span>From this most true and
firmly-established principle of the apostolic and catholic faith the
writer before us departs in company with the Pelagians. He will not have
it that men are born under the dominion of the devil, lest infants be
carried to Christ to be delivered from the power of darkness, and to be
translated into His kingdom. <span id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268.md)
Thus he becomes the accuser of the Church which is spread over the
world; into this Church everywhere infants, when to be baptized, are
first exorcised, for no other reason than that the prince of this world
may be cast out <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269.md) of them. For
by him must they be necessarily possessed, as vessels of wrath, since
they are born of Adam, unless they be born again in Christ, and
transferred through grace as vessels of mercy into His kingdom. In his
attack, however, upon this most firmly-established truth, he would avoid
the appearance of an assault upon the entire Church of Christ.
Accordingly, he limits his appeal to me alone, and in the tone of
reproof and admonition he says: “But God made even you, though it must
be confessed that a serious error has infected you.” Well now, I
thankfully acknowledge that God did make even me; and still I must have
perished with the vessels of wrath, if He had only made me of Adam, and
had not re-made me in Christ. Possessed, however, as this man is with
the heresy of Pelagius, he does not believe this: if, indeed, he
persists in so great an error to the very end, then not he, but
catholics, will be able to see the character and extent of the error
which has not simply infected, but absolutely destroyed <span
id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270.md) him.
