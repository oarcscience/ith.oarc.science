<span id="xix.iv.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46 \[XXIV.\]—Understanding and
Wisdom Must Be Sought from God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xlvi-p2"></span>Peruse attentively this treatise, and
if you understand it, give God the praise; but where you fail to
understand it, pray for understanding, for God will give you
understanding. Remember what the Scriptures say: “If any of you lack
wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not; and it shall be given to him.” <span
id="fr_3230"></span>[3231](#fn_3230.md) Wisdom itself cometh down from
above, as the Apostle James himself tells us. <span
id="fr_3231"></span>[3232](#fn_3231.md) There is, however, another wisdom,
which you must repel from you, and pray against its remaining in you;
this the same apostle expressed his detestation of when he said, “But if
ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, . . . this is not the
wisdom which descendeth from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
For wherever there is envying and strife, there is also confusion, and
every evil work. But the wisdom which is from above is first pure, then
peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good
works, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.” <span
id="fr_3232"></span>[3233](#fn_3232.md) What blessing, then, will that man
not have who has prayed for this wisdom and obtained it of the Lord? And
from this you may understand what grace is; because if this wisdom were
of ourselves, it would not be from above; nor would it be an object to
be asked for of the God who created us. Brethren, pray ye for us also,
that we may live “soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;
looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ,” <span id="fr_3233"></span>[3234](#fn_3233.md) to
whom belong the honour, and the glory, and the kingdom, with the Father
and the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.
