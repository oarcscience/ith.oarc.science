<span id="xvii.vi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Where the Kingdom of God May
Be Understood to Be.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.xvii-p2"></span>Now, they who say this, do no doubt
seem to themselves to say a good deal, because theirs is only a slight
and careless view of Scripture; nor do they understand in what sense we
use the phrase, “kingdom of God,” when we say of it in our prayers, “Thy
kingdom come;” <span id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) for that is
called the kingdom of God, in which His whole family shall reign with
Him in happiness and for ever. Now, in respect of the power which He
possesses over all things, he is of course even now reigning. What,
therefore, do we intend when we pray that His kingdom may come unless
that we may deserve to reign with Him? But even they will be under His
power who shall have to suffer the pains of eternal fire. Well, then, do
we mean to predicate of these unhappy beings that they too will be in
the kingdom of God? Surely it is one thing to be honoured with the gifts
and privileges of the kingdom of God, and another thing to be restrained
and punished by the laws of the same. <span id="page_350">p. 350</span>
<span id="xvii.vi.xvii-Page_350"></span>However, that you may have a
very manifest proof that on the one hand the kingdom of heaven must not
be parcelled out to the baptized, and other portions of the kingdom of
God be given to the unbaptized, as you seem to have determined, I beg of
you to hear the Lord’s own words; He does not say, “Except a man be born
again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom or
heaven;” but His words are, “he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”
His discourse with Nicodemus on the subject before us runs thus:
“Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God.” Observe, He does not here say, *the kingdom of
heaven,* but *the kingdom of God.* And then, on Nicodemus asking Him in
reply, “How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second
time into his mother’s womb and be born?” the Lord, in explanation,
repeats His former statement more plainly and openly: “Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” Observe again, He uses the same
phrase, *the kingdom of God,* not*the kingdom of heaven*. <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) It is worthy of remark, that while
He varies two expressions in explaining them the second time (for after
saying, “Except a man be born *again*,” He interprets that by the fuller
expression, “Except a man be born *of water and the Spirit;*” and in
like manner He explains, “he cannot see,” by the completer phrase, “he
cannot *enter into*”), He yet makes no variation here; He said “the
kingdom of God” the first time, and He afterwards repeated the same
phrase exactly. It is not now necessary to raise and discuss the
question, whether the kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven must be
understood as involving different senses, or whether only one thing is
described under two designations. It is enough to find that no one can
enter into the kingdom of God, except he be washed in the laver of
regeneration. I suppose you perceive by this time how wide of the truth
it is to separate from the kingdom of God any mansions that are placed
in the house of God. And as to the idea which you have entertained that
there will be found dwelling among the various mansions, which the Lord
has told us abound in His Father’s house, some who have not been born
again of water and the Spirit, I advise you, if you will permit me, not
to defer amending it, in order that you may hold the catholic faith.
