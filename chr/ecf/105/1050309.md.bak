id="xii.lxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 62.—Concerning What Grace of God is
Here Under Discussion. The Ungodly Man, When Dying, is Not Delivered
from Concupiscence.</span>

<span id="xii.lxvi-p2"></span>Now, whereas it is most correctly asked in
those words put to him, “Why do you affirm that man without the help of
God’s grace is able to avoid sin?” yet the inquiry did not concern that
grace by which man was created, but only that whereby he is saved
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Faithful men say in their prayer, “Lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) But if they already have capacity,
why do they pray? Or, what is the evil which they pray to be delivered
from, but, above all else, “the body of this death?” And from this
nothing but God’s grace alone delivers them, through our Lord Jesus
Christ. Not of course from the substance of the body, which is good; but
from its carnal offences, from which a man is not liberated except by
the grace of the Saviour,—not even when he quits the body by the death
of the body. If it was this that the apostle meant to declare, why had
he previously said, “I see another law in my members, warring against
the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
which is in my members?” <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md)
Behold what damage the disobedience of the will has inflicted on man’s
nature! Let him be permitted to pray that he may be healed! Why need he
presume so much on the capacity of his nature? It is wounded, hurt,
damaged, destroyed. It is a true confession of its weakness, not a false
defence of its capacity, that it stands in need of. It requires the
grace of God, not that it may be made, but that it may be re-made. And
this is the only grace which by our author is proclaimed to be
unnecessary; because of this he is silent! If, indeed, he had said
nothing at all about God’s grace, and had not proposed to himself that
question for solution, for the purpose of <span id="page_143">p.
143</span> <span id="xii.lxvi-Page_143"></span>removing from himself the
odium of this matter, <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md) it
might have been thought that his view of the subject was consistent with
the truth, only that he had refrained from mentioning it, on the ground
that not on all occasions need we say all we think. He proposed the
question of grace, and answered it in the way that he had in his heart;
the question has been defined,—not in the way we wished, but according
to the doubt we entertained as to what was his meaning.
