<span id="x.v.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[XII.\]—The Precept About Touching
the Menstruous Woman Not to Be Figuratively Understood; The Necessity of
the Sacraments.</span>

<span id="x.v.xxi-p2"></span>Let no one, then, on this subject be either
deceived or a deceiver. The manifest sense of Holy Scripture which we
have considered, removes all obscurities. Even as death is in this our
mortal body derived from the beginning, so from the beginning has sin
been drawn into this sinful flesh of ours, for the cure of which, both
as it is derived by propagation and augmented by wilful transgression,
as well as for the quickening of our flesh itself, our Physician came in
the likeness of sinful flesh, who is not needed by the sound, but only
by the sick,—and who came not to call the righteous, but sinners. <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700) Therefore the saying of the apostle,
when advising believers not to separate themselves from unbelieving
partners: “For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and
the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your
children unclean; but now are they holy,” <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701) must be either so understood as both
we ourselves elsewhere, <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702) and as
Pelagius in his notes on this same Epistle to the Corinthians, <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703) has expounded it, according to the
purport of the passages already mentioned, that sometimes wives gained
husbands to Christ, and sometimes husbands converted wives, whilst the
Christian will of even one of the parents prevailed towards making their
children Christians; or else (as the apostle’s words seem rather to
indicate, and to a certain degree compel us) some particular
sanctification is to be here understood, by which <span id="page_78">p.
78</span> <span id="x.v.xxi-Page_78"></span>an unbelieving husband or
wife was sanctified by the believing partner, and by which the children
of the believing parents were sanctified,—whether it was that the
husband or the wife, during the woman’s menstruation, abstained from
cohabiting, having learned that duty in the law (for Ezekiel classes
this amongst the precepts which were not to be taken in a metaphorical
sense <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704) ), or on account of some
other voluntary sanctification which is not there expressly
prescribed,—a sprinkling of holiness arising out of the close ties of
married life and children. Nevertheless, whatever be the sanctification
meant, this must be steadily held: that there is no other valid means of
making Christians and remitting sins, except by men becoming believers
through the sacrament according to the institution of Christ and the
Church. For neither are unbelieving husbands and wives, notwithstanding
their intimate union with holy and righteous spouses, cleansed of the
sin which separates men from the kingdom of God and drives them into
condemnation, nor are the children who are born of parents, however just
and holy, absolved from the guilt of original sin, unless they have been
baptized into Christ; and in behalf of these our plea should be the more
earnest, the less able they are to urge one themselves.
