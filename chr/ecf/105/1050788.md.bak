id="xvii.vii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—Inconsistency of Giving the
Soul All the Parts of Sex and Yet No Sex.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxxii-p2"></span>For that form of the soul, whether
masculine or feminine, which has the distinction of members
characteristic of man and woman, being no semblance merely of body, but
actual body, is either a male or a female, whether you will or no,
precisely as it appears to be a man or a woman. But if your opinion be
correct, and the soul is a body, even a living body, then it both
possesses swelling and pendent breasts, and lacks a beard, it has a
womb, and all the generative organs of a woman, yet is not a woman after
all. Will not mine, then, be a statement more consistent with truth: the
soul, indeed, has an eye and has a tongue, has a finger, and all other
members which resemble those of the body, and yet the whole is the
semblance <span id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.xxxii-Page_368"></span>of a body, not a body really? My
statement is open to a general test; everybody can prove it in himself,
when he brings home to his mind the image of absent friends; he can
prove it with certainty when he recalls the figures both of himself and
other persons, which have occurred to him in his dreams. On your part,
however, no example can throughout nature be produced of such a
monstrosity as you have imagined, where there is a woman’s real and
living body, but not a woman’s sex.
