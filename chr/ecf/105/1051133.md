<span id="xxi.iii.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51 \[XX.\]—Predestination Must Be
Preached.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.liii-p2"></span>Wherefore, if both the apostles and
the teachers of the Church who succeeded them and imitated them did both
these things,—that is, both truly preached the grace of God which is not
given according to our merits, and inculcated by wholesome precepts a
pious obedience,—what is it which these people of our time think
themselves rightly bound by the invincible force of truth to say, “Even
if what is said of the predestination of God’s benefits be true, yet it
<span id="page_547">p. 547</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.liii-Page_547"></span>must not be preached to the
people”? <span id="fr_3687"></span>[3688](#fn_3687) It must absolutely
be preached, so that he who has ears to hear, may hear. And who has them
if he has not received them from Him who says, “I will give them a heart
to know me, and ears to hear?” <span
id="fr_3688"></span>[3689](#fn_3688) Assuredly, he who has not received
may reject; while, yet, he who receives may take and drink, may drink
and live. For as piety must be preached, that, by him who has ears to
hear, God may be rightly worshipped; modesty must be preached, that, by
him who has ears to hear, no illicit act may be perpetrated by his
fleshly nature; charity must be preached, that, by him who has ears to
hear, God and his neighbours may be loved;—so also must be preached such
a predestination of God’s benefits that he who has ears to hear may
glory, not in himself, but in the Lord.
