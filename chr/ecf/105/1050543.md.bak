<span id="xv.iv.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32 \[XXVII.\]—He Shows by the
Example of Abraham that the Ancient Saints Believed in the Incarnation
of Christ.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>For it must not be supposed that those
saints of old only profited by Christ’s divinity, which was ever
existent, and not also by the revelation of His humanity, which had not
yet come to pass. What the Lord Jesus says, “Abraham desired to see my
day, and he saw it, and was glad,” <span
id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987.md) meaning by the phrase *his day* to
understand *his time*, affords of course a clear testimony that Abraham
was fully imbued with belief in His incarnation. It is in respect of
this that He has a “time;” for His divinity exceeds all time, for it was
by it that all times were created. If, however, any one supposes that
the phrase in question must be understood of that eternal <span
id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span id="xv.iv.xxxii-Page_248"></span>
“day” which is limited by no morrow, and preceded by no yesterday,—in a
word, of the very eternity in which He is co-eternal with the
Father,—how would Abraham really desire this, unless he was aware that
there was to be a future mortality belonging to Him whose eternity he
wished for? Or, perhaps, some one would confine the meaning of the
phrase so far as to say, that nothing else is meant in the Lord’s
saying, “He desired to see my day,” than “He desired to see me,” who am
the never-ending Day, or the unfailing Light, as when we mention the
life of the Son, concerning which it is said in the Gospel: “So hath He
given to the Son to have life in Himself.” <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md) Here the life is nothing less than
Himself. So we understand the Son Himself to be the life, when He said,
“I am the way, the truth, and the life;” <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) of whom also it was said, “He is
the true God, and eternal life.” <span
id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md) Supposing, then, that Abraham
desired to see this equal divinity of the Son’s with the Father, without
any precognition of His coming in the flesh—as certain philosophers
sought Him, who knew nothing of His flesh—can that other act of Abraham,
when he orders his servant to place his hand under his thigh, and to
swear by the God of heaven, <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md)
be rightly understood by any one otherwise than as showing that Abraham
well knew that the flesh in which the God of heaven was to come was the
offspring of that very thigh? <span id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992.md)

<span id="xv.iv.xxxii-p8"></span> The word “thigh,” <span
class="Hebrew"><span id="xv.iv.xxxii-p8.1"></span>ךְרֵיָ</span>, occurs
in the phrase, “to come out from the thigh of any one,” in the sense of
*being begotten by any one*, or *descended from him*, in several
passages: see [Gen. 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#026.md), [Exod.
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#005.md), [Judg.
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#030.md)<span
id="xv.iv.xxxii-p8.2"></span>. In the last of these passages, the A.V.
phrase, “of his body begotten,” is <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="xv.iv.xxxii-p8.3"></span>וׁכרֵיְ יאציֹּ</span>, *the offspring of
his thigh*. Abraham was the first to use this form of adjuration; after
him his grandson Jacob, [Gen.
47.29](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#029.md)<span
id="xv.iv.xxxii-p8.4"></span>. The comment of Augustin in the text,
which he repeats elsewhere (see his *Sermon* 75), occurs also in other
Fathers, *e.g.* Jerome, Theodoret, Ambrose (*De Abrahamo*, i. cap.
ult.), Prosper (*Prædicat*. i. 7), and Gregory the Great, who says: “He
orders him to put his hand under his thigh, since through that member
would descend the flesh of Him who was Abraham’s son according to the
flesh, and his Lord owing to His divinity.”
