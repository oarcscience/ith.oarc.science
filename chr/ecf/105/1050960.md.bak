<span id="xix.iv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—The Pelagians Contend that the
Grace, Which is Neither the Law Nor Nature, Avails Only to the Remission
of Past Sins, But Not to the Avoidance of Future Ones.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxvi-p2"></span>They also maintain that God’s grace,
which is given through the faith of Jesus Christ, and which is neither
the law nor nature, avails only for the remission of sins that have been
committed, and not for the shunning of future ones, or the subjugation
of those which are now assailing us. Now if all this were true, surely
after offering the petition of the Lord’s Prayer, “Forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors,” we could hardly go on and say, “And lead us
not into temptation.” <span id="fr_3092"></span>[3093](#fn_3092.md) The
former petition we present that our sins may be forgiven; the latter,
that they may be avoided or subdued,—a favour which we should by no
means beg of our Father who is in heaven if we were able to accomplish
it by the virtue of our human will. Now I strongly advise and earnestly
require your Love <span id="fr_3093"></span>[3094](#fn_3093.md) to read
attentively the book of the blessed Cyprian which he wrote *On the
Lord’s Prayer*. As far as the Lord shall assist you, understand it, and
commit it to memory. In this work you will see how he so appeals to the
free will of those whom he edifies in his treatise, as to show them,
that whatever they have to fulfil in the law, they must ask for in the
prayer. But this, of course, would be utterly empty if the human will
were sufficient for the performance without the help of God.
