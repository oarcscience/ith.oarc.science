<span id="xvi.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18 \[XVI.\]—Continence Better Than
Marriage; But Marriage Better Than Fornication.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xviii-p2"></span>Forasmuch, then, as marriage cannot be
such as that of the primitive men might have been, if sin had not
preceded; it may yet be like that of the holy fathers of the olden time,
in such wise that the carnal concupiscence which causes shame (which did
not exist in paradise previous to the fall, and after that event was not
allowed to remain there), although necessarily forming a part of the
body of this death, is not subservient to it, but only submits its
function, when forced thereto, for the sole purpose of assisting in the
procreation of children; otherwise, since the present time (as we have
already <span id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121) said.md) is the period
for abstaining from the nuptial embrace, and therefore makes no
necessary demand on the exercise of the said function, seeing that all
nations now contribute so abundantly to the production of an offspring
which shall receive spiritual birth, there is the greater room for the
blessing of an excellent continence. “He that is able to receive it, let
him receive it.” <span id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122.md) He, however,
who cannot receive it, “even if he marry, sinneth not;” <span
id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123.md) and if a woman have not the gift of
continence, let her also marry. <span
id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124.md) “It is good, indeed, for a man not
to touch a woman.” <span id="fr_2125"></span>[2126](#fn_2125.md) But since
“all men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is
given,” <span id="fr_2126"></span>[2127](#fn_2126.md) it remains that “to
avoid fornication, every man ought to have his own wife, and every woman
her own husband.” <span id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127.md) And thus
the weakness of incontinence is hindered from falling into the ruin of
profligacy by the honourable estate of matrimony. Now that which the
apostle says of women, “I will therefore that the younger women
marry,” <span id="fr_2128"></span>[2129](#fn_2128.md) is also applicable to
males: I will that the younger men take wives; that so it may appertain
to both sexes alike “to bear children, to be” fathers and “mothers of
families, to give none occasion to the adversary to speak
reproachfully.” <span id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129.md)
