<span id="xii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—A Distinction Drawn by Pelagius
Between the Possible and Actual.</span>

<span id="xii.xii-p2"></span>For he first of all makes a distinction:
“It is one thing,” says he, “to inquire whether a thing can be, which
has respect to its possibility only; and another thing, whether or not
it is.” This distinction, nobody doubts, is true enough; for it follows
that whatever is, was able to be; but it does not therefore follow that
what is able to be, also is. Our Lord, for instance, raised Lazarus; He
unquestionably was able to do so. But inasmuch as He did not raise up
Judas <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) must we therefore
contend that He was unable to do so? He certainly was able, but He would
not. For if He had been willing, He could have effected this too. For
the Son quickeneth whomsoever He will. <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) Observe, however, what he means by
this distinction, true and manifest enough in itself, and what he
endeavours to make out of it. “We are treating,” says he, “of
possibility only; and to pass from this to something else, except in the
case of some certain fact, we deem to be a very serious and
extraordinary process.” This idea he turns over again and again, in many
ways and at great length, so that no one would suppose that he was
inquiring about any other point than the possibility of not committing
sin. Among the many passages in which he treats of this subject, occurs
the following: “I once more repeat my position: I say that it is
possible for a man to be without sin. What do you say? That it is
impossible for a man to be without sin? But I do not say,” he adds,
“that there is a man without sin; nor do you say, that there is not a
man without sin. Our contention is about what is possible, and not
possible; not about what is, and is not.” He then enumerates certain
passages of Scripture, <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md) which
are usually alleged in opposition to them, and insists that they have
nothing to do with the question, which is really in dispute, as to the
possibility or impossibility of a man’s being without sin. This is what
he says: “No man indeed is clean from pollution; and, There is no man
that sinneth not; and, There is not a just man upon the earth; and,
There is none that doeth good. There are these and similar passages in
Scripture,” says he, “but they testify to the point of not being, not of
not being able; for by testimonies of this sort it is shown what kind of
per<span id="page_124">p. 124</span> <span
id="xii.xii-Page_124"></span>sons certain men were at such and such a
time, not that they were unable to be something else. Whence they are
justly found to be blameworthy. If, however, they had been of such a
character, simply because they were unable to be anything else, they are
free from blame.”
