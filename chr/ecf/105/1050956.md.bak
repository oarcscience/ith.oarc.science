<span id="xix.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22 \[X.\]—Who is the Transgressor
of the Law? The Oldness of Its Letter. The Newness of Its Spirit.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxii-p2"></span>Therefore, brethren, you ought by free
will not do evil but do good; this, indeed, is the lesson taught us in
the law of God, in the Holy Scriptures—both Old and New. Let us,
however, read, and by the Lord’s help understand, what the apostle tells
us: “Because by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified
in His sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” <span
id="fr_3071"></span>[3072](#fn_3071.md) Observe, he says “*the knowledge*,”
not “the destruction,” of sin. But when a man knows sin, and grace does
not help him to avoid what he knows, undoubtedly the law works wrath.
And this the apostle explicitly says in another passage. His words are:
“The law worketh wrath.” <span id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072.md) The
reason of this statement lies in the fact that God’s wrath is greater in
the case of the transgressor who by the law knows sin, and yet commits
it; such a man is thus a transgressor of the law, even as the apostle
says in another sentence, “For where no law is, there is no
transgression.” <span id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073.md) It is in
accordance with this principle that he elsewhere says, “That we may
serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter;” <span
id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074.md) wishing *the law* to be here
understood by “the oldness of the letter,” and what else by “newness of
spirit” than *grace*? Then, that it might not be thought that he had
brought any accusation, or suggested any blame, against the law, he
immediately takes himself to task with this inquiry: “What shall we say,
then? Is the law sin? God forbid.” He then adds the statement: “Nay, I
had not known sin but by the law;” <span
id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075.md) which is of the same import as the
passage above quoted: “By the law <span id="page_453">p. 453</span>
<span id="xix.iv.xxii-Page_453"></span>is the knowledge of sin.” <span
id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076.md) Then: “For I had not known lust,”
he says, “except the law had said, ‘Thou shalt not covet.’ <span
id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077.md) But sin, taking occasion by the
commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the
law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once; but when the
commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which
was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion
by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is
holy; and the commandment holy, just, and good. Was, then, that which is
good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin,
worked death in me by that which is good,—in order that the sinner,
or <span id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078.md) the sin, might by the
commandment become beyond measure.” <span
id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079.md) And to the Galatians he writes:
“Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, except
through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ,
that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works
of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be
justified.” <span id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md)
