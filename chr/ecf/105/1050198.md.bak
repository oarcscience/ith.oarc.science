<span id="xi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—No Man Justified by Works.</span>

<span id="xi.xxv-p2"></span>What the difference between them is, I will
briefly explain. What the law of works enjoins by menace, that the law
of faith secures by faith. The one says, “Thou shalt not covet;” <span
id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md) the other says, “When I perceived that
nobody could be continent, except God gave it to him; and that this was
the very point of wisdom, to know whose gift she was; I approached unto
the Lord, and I besought Him.” <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md)
This indeed is the very wisdom which is called *piety*, in which is
worshipped “the Father of lights, from whom is every best giving and
perfect gift.” <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) This worship,
however, consists in the sacrifice of praise and giving of thanks, so
that the worshipper of God boasts not in himself, but in Him. <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md) Accordingly, by the law of works, God
says to us, Do what I command thee; but by the law of faith we say to
God, Give me what Thou commandest. Now this is the reason why the law
gives its command,—to admonish us what faith ought to do, that is, that
he to whom the command is given, if he is as yet unable to perform it,
may know what to ask for; but if he has at once the ability, and
complies with the command, he ought also to be aware from whose gift the
ability comes. “For we have received not the spirit of this world,” says
again that most constant preacher of grace, “but the Spirit which is of
God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
God.” <span id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) What, however, “is the
spirit of this world,” but the spirit of pride? By it their foolish
heart is darkened, who, although knowing God, glorified Him not as <span
id="page_93">p. 93</span> <span id="xi.xxv-Page_93"></span>God, by
giving Him thanks. <span id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md) Moreover, it
is really by this same spirit that they too are deceived, who, while
ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own
righteousness, have not submitted to God’s righteousness. <span
id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md) It appears to me, therefore, that he
is much more “a child of faith” who has learned from what source to hope
for what he has not yet, than he who attributes to himself whatever he
has; although, no doubt, to both of these must be preferred the man who
both has, and at the same time knows from whom he has it, if
nevertheless he does not believe himself to be what he has not yet
attained to. Let him not fall into the mistake of the Pharisee, who,
while thanking God for what he possessed, yet failed to ask for any
further gift, just as if he stood in want of nothing for the increase or
perfection of his righteousness. <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md)
Now, having duly considered and weighed all these circumstances and
testimonies, we conclude that a man is not justified by the precepts of
a holy life, but by faith in Jesus Christ,—in a word, not by the law of
works, but by the law of faith; not by the letter, but by the spirit;
not by the merits of deeds, but by free grace.
