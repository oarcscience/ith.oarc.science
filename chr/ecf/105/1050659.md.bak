<span id="xvi.vi.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52 \[XXX.\]—Sin Was the Origin of
All Shameful Concupiscence.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.liii-p2"></span>“Do you,” he asks, “repeat your
affirmation, ‘There would be no concupiscence if man had not first
sinned; marriage, however, would have existed, even if no one had
sinned’?” I never said, “There would be no concupiscence,” because there
is a concupiscence of the spirit, which craves wisdom. <span
id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md) My words were, “There would be no
*shameful* concupiscence.” <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md)
Let my words be re-perused, even those which he has cited, that it may
be clearly seen how dishonestly they are handled by him. However, let
him call it by any name he likes. What I said would not have existed
unless man had previously sinned, was that which made them ashamed in
paradise when they covered their loins, and which every one will allow
would not have been felt, had not the sin of disobedience first
occurred. Now he who wishes to understand what they felt, ought to
consider what it was they covered. For of the fig-leaves they made
themselves “aprons,” not clothes; and these aprons or kilts are called
<span class="Greek"><span id="xvi.vi.liii-p4.1"></span>περιζώματα</span>
in Greek. Now all know well enough what it is which these *peri-zomata*
cover, which some Latin writers explain by the word *campestria*. Who is
ignorant of what persons wore this kilt, and what parts of the body such
a dress concealed; even the same which the Roman youths used to cover
when they practised naked in the *campus*, from which circumstance the
name *campester* was given to the apron. <span
