<span id="xxi.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—The Difficulty of the
Distinction Made in the Choice of One and the Rejection of
Another.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xix-p2"></span>“But why,” it is said, “in one and the
same case, not only of infants, but even of twin children, is the
judgment so diverse?” Is it not a similar question, “Why in a different
case is the judgment the same?” Let us recall, then, those labourers in
the vineyard who worked the whole day, and those who toiled one hour.
Certainly the case was different as to the labour expended, and yet
there was the same judgment in paying the wages. Did the murmurers in
this case hear anything from the householder except, Such is my will?
Certainly such was his liberality towards some, that there could be no
injustice towards others. And both these classes, indeed, are among the
good. Nevertheless, so far as it concerns justice and grace, it may be
truly said to the guilty who is condemned, also concerning the guilty
who is delivered, “Take what thine is, and go thy way;” <span
id="fr_3592"></span>[3593](#fn_3592.md) “I will give unto this one that
which is not due;” “Is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thine
eye evil because I am good?” And how if he should say, “Why not to me
also?” He will hear, and with reason, “Who art thou, O man, that
repliest against God?” <span id="fr_3593"></span>[3594](#fn_3593.md) And
although assuredly in the one case you see a most benignant benefactor,
and in your own case a most righteous exactor, in neither case do you
behold an unjust God. For although He would be righteous even if He were
to punish both, he who is delivered has good ground for thankfulness, he
who is condemned has no ground for finding fault.
