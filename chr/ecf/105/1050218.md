<span id="xi.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42 \[XXV.\]—Difference Between the Old
and the New Testaments.</span>

<span id="xi.xlv-p2"></span>I beg of you, however, carefully to observe,
as far as you can, what I am endeavouring to prove with so much effort.
When the prophet promised a new covenant, not according to the covenant
which had been formerly made with the people of Israel when liberated
from Egypt, he said nothing about a change in the sacrifices or any
sacred ordinances, although such change, too, was without doubt to
follow, as we see in fact that it did follow, even as the same prophetic
scripture testifies in many other passages; but he simply called
attention to this difference, that God would impress His laws on the
mind of those who belonged to this covenant, and would write them in
their hearts, <span id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907) whence the apostle
drew his conclusion,—“not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living
God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart;” <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908) and that the eternal recompense of
this righteousness was not the land out of which were driven the
Amorites and Hittites, and other nations who dwelt there, <span
id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909) but God Himself, “to whom it is good
to hold fast,” <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910) in order that
God’s good that they love, may be the God Himself whom they love,
between whom and men nothing but sin produces separation; and this is
remitted only by grace. Accordingly, after saying, “For all shall know
me, from the least to the greatest of them,” He instantly added, “For I
will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
more.” <span id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911) By the law of works,
then, the Lord says, “Thou shalt not covet:” <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912) but by the law of faith He says,
“Without me ye can do nothing;” <span id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913)
for He was treating of good works, even the fruit of the vine-branches.
It is therefore apparent what dif<span id="page_101">p. 101</span> <span
id="xi.xlv-Page_101"></span>ference there is between the old covenant
and the new,—that in the former the law is written on tables, while in
the latter on hearts; so that what in the one alarms from without, in
the other delights from within; and in the former man becomes a
transgressor through the letter that kills, in the other a lover through
the life-giving spirit. We must therefore avoid saying, that the way in
which God assists us to work righteousness, and “works in us both to
will and to do of His good pleasure,” <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914) is by externally addressing to our
faculties precepts of holiness; for He gives His increase
internally, <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915) by shedding love
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us.” <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916)
