<span id="xiii.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—(43.) No Man is Assisted Unless
He Does Himself Also Work. Our Course is a Constant Progress.</span>

<span id="xiii.xlvii-p2"></span>But what is the import of the last
statement which he has made: “If any one say, ‘May it possibly be that a
man sin not even in word?’ then the answer,” says he, “which must be
given is, ‘Quite possible, if God so will; and God does so will,
therefore it is possible.’” See how unwilling he was to say, “If God
give His help, then it would be possible;” and yet the Psalmist thus
addresses God: “Be Thou my helper, forsake me not;” <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md) where of course help is not sought
for procuring bodily advantages and avoiding bodily evils, but for
practising and fulfilling righteousness. Hence it is that we say: “Lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) Now no man is assisted unless he
also himself does something; assisted, however, he is, if he prays, if
he believes, if he is “called according to God’s purpose;” <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) for “whom He did foreknow, He also
did predestinate to be conformed <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="xiii.xlvii-Page_176"></span>to the image of His Son, that He might
be the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did
predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also
justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.” <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md) We run, therefore, whenever we make
advance; and our wholeness runs with us in our advance (just as a sore
is said to run <span id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) when the wound
is in process of a sound and careful treatment), in order that we may be
in every respect perfect, without any infirmity of sin whatever,—a
result which God not only wishes, but even causes and helps us to
accomplish. And this God’s grace does, in co-operation with ourselves,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, as well by commandments, sacraments, and
examples, as by His Holy Spirit also; through whom there is hiddenly
shed abroad in our hearts  <span id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md)
that love, “which maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot
be uttered,” <span id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) until wholeness
and salvation be perfected in us, and God be manifested to us as He will
be seen in His eternal truth.
