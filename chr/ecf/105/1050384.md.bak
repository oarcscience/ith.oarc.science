pelagius.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="xiv.iii-p3"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xiv.iii-p3.1"></span>In</span> the year of Christ 415, Pelagius was
accused of heresy in Palestine, and brought to trial on one or two
occasions. At the first trial, which was held on or about the 30th of
July, at a congress of his presbyters, by John, bishop of Jerusalem, no
regular record was kept of the proceedings, as we are informed by
Augustin in the following work (sec. 39 and 55). The hour and the day of
this assembly we may learn from Orosius, a presbyter of Spain, who was
present at the congress, and has in his *Apology* committed to writing
some of its most memorable acts. We are informed by him that “after a
great deal of earnest proceeding on both sides, the bishop John proposed
the last resolution, that certain brethren should be sent with a letter
to blessed Innocent, Pope of Rome, to the intent that he might decide on
all the points which were to follow.”

<span id="xiv.iii-p4"></span>The second trial took place afterwards at
Diospolis, <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) a city in
Palestine, before fourteen bishops, at which was kept an accurate record
of the proceedings. The bishops are severally mentioned by Augustin in
his work *against Julianus*, Book i. chs. v. and vii. (19, 32), in the
following order: “Eulogius, John, Ammonianus, Porphyry, Eutonius,
another Porphyry, Fidus, Zoninus, Zoboennus, Nymphidius, Chromatius,
Jovinus, Eleutherius, and Clematius.” There can be no doubt that
Eulogius, bishop of Cæsarea, was also primate of the province of
Palestine, because he is constantly mentioned by Augustin as occupying
the first place before the other thirteen bishops, and even before John
himself, bishop of Jerusalem.

<span id="xiv.iii-p6"></span>We find from the epistle of Lucian, <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) *De revelatione corporis Stephani
martyris*, that this synod was held at the approach of Christmas. In
this epistle he tells us of three visions which God had shown him in the
year 415,—the first on December 3d, and the other two on the 10th and
17th of the same month; that he then reported the matter to John, bishop
of Jerusalem, who sent him in quest of the martyr’s sepulchre. He
further informs us that he discovered the sepulchre, and at once
returned to John, “who (says he) was attending a synod at Lydda, which
is Diospolis.” This must have happened about the 21st of the month,
since Lucian goes on to say that John came, in the company of two more
bishops, Eutonius of Sebaste and Eleutherius of Jericho, and that in
their presence the relics of the martyr were removed on the 26th day of
the same month of December.

<span id="xiv.iii-p8"></span>A certain deacon, called Annianus, is
supposed to have pleaded the cause of Pelagius at the synod; some
learned men finding it easier to interpret of this deacon than of
Pelagius what Jerome writes in a letter addressed to Alypius and
Augustin (*Epist. Augustinian*. 202, 2): “For every thing which he
denies having ever uttered in that miserable synod of Diospolis he
professes to hold in this work.” Jerome bestowed the epithet of
“miserable” on this synod of Diospolis, for no other reason (as we
suppose) than because he discovered from its Acts how miserably the
synod had been duped by Pelagius. Pope Innocent, after a sight of these
Acts, expressly owned (see *Epist. Augustinian*. 183, 4) that “he could
not bring himself to refuse either blame or praise of those bishops.”
Augustin, however, in the following treatise (see chs. 4 and 8), does
not hesitate to call them “pious judges,” and (in his first book
*against Julianus*, i. ch. v. 19) “catholic judges,” who, when Pelagius
abjured the errors attributed to him, pronounced him a catholic, and
acquitted him; indeed, he frequently cites these fourteen bishops as
witnesses of the catholic faith in opposition to Julianus.

<span id="xiv.iii-p9"></span>In his letters addressed to Pope Innocent
in the year 416 (see *Epist. Augustinian*. 175, 4, and 177, 2), Augustin
intimated that he knew nothing of the Proceedings of the synod except
from hearsay; and in a letter to John, bishop of Jerusalem (*Epist*.
179, 4), he earnestly requested him to forward them to him. But the
report was in his hands about midsummer in 417, when he wrote his
Epistle to Paulinus (*Epist*. 186, 31); so that the date of the
following treatise is thus traced to the commencement of the year 417,
supposing it to have been published immediately after he had received
the Proceedings.

<span id="xiv.iii-p10"></span>The title given to this work by Augustin,
in his book *On Original Sin* (15), stands *De Gestis Palæstinis* \[On
the Proceedings which took place in Palestine\]; by this title Prosper
likewise refers to the work (in his book *Adv.* <span id="page_180">p.
180</span> <span id="xiv.iii-Page_180"></span>*Collatorem,* 43); but yet
we ought to retain the inscription *De Gestis Pelagii* which is prefixed
both to the ancient editions and to the particular *Retractation* in
which Augustin reviewed this work. The treatise had this title given to
it, no doubt, either because it had been already commonly accepted as a
description of these proceedings of Pelagius and his vindication, which
led to his boast that he had been acquitted; or else from the fact that
an examination had become necessary of those proceedings, which the
accused party had himself published in an abridged and garbled form.
Hence Possidonius named the treatise by the title, *Contra Gesta
Pelagii* \[A Protest, or Vindication, against the Proceedings of
Pelagius\].

<span id="xiv.iii-p11"></span>Out of this book Photius copied a very
accurate account of the Synod of Diospolis and inserted it in his
*Bibliotheca* (cod. 54). One may therefore conclude that this work of
Augustin’s is one of those which Possidonius, in his Life, ch. xi. or
xxi., No. 59, mentions as having been “translated into the Greek
tongue.” The Aurelius to whom the work is dedicated is mentioned by
Photius in the passage just cited, and by Prosper before him (in the 43d
chapter of the above-quoted *Adversus Collatorem*), as “the bishop of
Carthage.” If the title-page of old did not give them this information,
they could both of them discover it from reading this book, especially
ch. 23 \[XI.\].
