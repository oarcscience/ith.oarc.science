<span id="x.iv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Grace is Given to Some Men in
Mercy; Is Withheld from Others in Justice and Truth.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxxi-p2"></span>Forasmuch then as our turning away from
God is our own act, and this is evil will; but our turning to God is not
possible, except He rouses and helps us, and this is good will,—what
have we that we have not received? But if we received, why do we glory
as if we had not received? Therefore, as “he that glorieth must glory in
the Lord,” <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) it comes from His
mercy, not their merit, that God wills to impart this to some, but from
His truth that He wills not to impart it to others. For to sinners
punishment is justly due, because “the Lord God loveth mercy and
truth,” <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) and “mercy and truth are
met together;” <span id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md) and “all the
paths of the Lord are <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> <span
id="x.iv.xxxi-Page_57"></span>mercy and truth.” <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) And who can tell the numberless
instances in which Holy Scripture combines these two attributes?
Sometimes, by a change in the terms, *grace* is put for *merc*y, as in
the passage, “We beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of
the Father, full of grace and truth.” <span
id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) Sometimes also *judgment* occurs
instead of *truth*, as in the passage, “I will sing of mercy and
judgment unto Thee, O Lord.” <span id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md)
