id="xvii.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Augustin Compliments Victor’s
Talents and Diligence.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.xxi-p2"></span>It would take me too long a time to
handle and discuss fully all the points which I wish to be amended in
your books, or rather in your own self, and to give you even a brief
reason for the correction of each particular. And yet you must not
because of them despise yourself, so as to suppose that your ability and
powers of speech are to be thought lightly of. I have discovered in you
no small recollection of the sacred Scriptures; but your erudition is
less than was proportioned to your talent, and the labour you bestowed
on them. My desire, therefore, is that you should not, on the one hand,
grow vain by attributing too much to yourself; nor, on the <span
id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span id="xvii.vi.xxi-Page_352"></span>other
hand, become cold and indifferent by prostration or despair. I only wish
that I could read your writings in company with yourself, and point out
the necessary emendations in conversation rather than by writing. This
is a matter which could be more easily accomplished by oral
communication between ourselves than in letters. If the entire subject
were to be treated in writing, it would require many volumes. Those
chief errors, however, which I have wished to sum up comprehensively in
a definite number, I at once call your attention to, in order that you
may not postpone the correction of them, but banish them entirely from
your preaching and belief; so that the great faculty which you possess
of disputation, may, by God’s grace, be employed by you usefully for
edification, not for injuring and destroying sound and wholesome
doctrine.
