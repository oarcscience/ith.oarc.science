<span id="xviii.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—How the Apostle Said that
He Did the Evil that He Would Not.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xviii-p2"></span>Or by chance do we fear what
follows, “For that which I do I know not, for what I will I do not, but
what I hate that I do,” <span id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572.md) lest
perhaps from these words some one should suspect that the apostle is
consenting to the evil works of the concupiscence of the flesh? But we
must consider what he adds: “But if I do that which I will not, I
consent to the law that it is good.” For he says that he rather consents
to the law than to the concupiscence of the flesh. For this he calls by
the name of sin. Therefore he said that he acted and laboured not with
the desire of consenting and fulfilling, but from the impulse of lusting
itself. Hence, then, he says, “I consent to the law that it is good.” I
consent because I do not will what it does not will. Afterwards he says,
“Now, then, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in
me.” <span id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md) What does he mean by
“now then,” but, now at length, under the grace which has delivered the
delight of my will from the consent of lust? For, “it is not I that do
it,” cannot be better understood than that he does not consent to set
forth his members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. For if he
lusts and consents and acts, how can he be said not to do the thing
himself, even although he may grieve that he does it, and deeply groan
at being overcome?
