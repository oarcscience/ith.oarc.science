<span id="xi.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XXIV\]—The Eternal Reward Which is
Specially Declared in the New Testament, Foretold by the Prophet.</span>

<span id="xi.xlii-p2"></span>Accordingly, in our prophet likewise, whose
testimony we are dealing with, this is added, that in God is the reward,
in Him the end, in Him the perfection of happiness, in Him the sum of
the blessed and eternal life. For after saying, “I will be their God,
and they shall be my people,” he at once adds, “And they shall no more
teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know
the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least even unto the
greatest of them.” <span id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md) Now, the
present is certainly the time of the New Testament, the promise of which
is given by the prophet in the words which we have quoted from his
prophecy. Why then does each man still say even now to his neighbour and
his brother, “Know the Lord?” Or is it not perhaps meant that this is
everywhere said when the gospel is preached, and when this is its very
proclamation? For on what ground does the apostle call himself “a
teacher of the Gentiles,”  <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md) if it
be not that what he himself implies in the following passage becomes
realized: “How shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?
and how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? and how
shall they hear without a preacher?” <span
id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md) Since, then, this preaching is now
everywhere spreading, in what way is it the time of the New Testament of
which the prophet spoke in the words, “And they shall not every man
teach his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord;
for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of
them,” <span id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md) unless it be that he has
included in his prophetic forecast the eternal reward of the said New
Testament, by promising us the most blessed contemplation of God
Himself?
