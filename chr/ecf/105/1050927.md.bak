id="xviii.vi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—The Calling Together of a
Synod Not Always Necessary to the Condemnation of Heresies.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxxiv-p2"></span>What is it, then, that they say,
that “subscription was extorted from simple bishops sitting in their
places without any Synodal congregation”? Was subscription extorted
against such heretics as these from the most blessed and excellent men
in the faith, Cyprian and Ambrose, before such heretics as these were in
existence?—seeing that they overthrow their impious dogmas with such
clearness that we can scarcely find anything more manifest to say
against them. Or, indeed, was there any need of the congregation of a
Synod to condemn this open pest, as if no heresy could at any time be
condemned except by a Synodal congregation?—when, on the contrary, very
few heresies can be found for the sake of condemning which any such
necessity has arisen; and those have been many and incomparably more
which have deserved to be accused and condemned in the place where they
arose, and thence could be known and avoided over the rest of the lands.
But the pride of such as these, which lifts itself up so much against
God as not to be willing to glory in Him but rather in free will, is
understood as grasping also at this glory, that a Synod of the East and
West should be gathered together on their account. In fact, they
endeavour, forsooth, to disturb the catholic world, because, the Lord
being against them, they are unable to pervert it; when rather they
ought to have been trodden out wherever those wolves might have
appeared, by watchfulness and pastoral diligence, after a competent and
sufficient judgment made concerning them; whether with a view of their
being healed and changed, or with a view of their being shunned by the
safety and soundness of others, by the help of the Shepherd of the
sheep, who seeks the lost sheep also among the little ones, who makes
the sheep holy and righteous freely; who both providently instructs
them, although sanctified and justified, yet in their frailty and
infirmity to pray for a daily remission for their daily sins, without
which no one lives in this world, even although he may live well; and
mercifully listens to their prayers.
