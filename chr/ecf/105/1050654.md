<span id="xvi.vi.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47.—The Scriptures Repeatedly
Teach Us that All Sin in One.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xlviii-p2"></span>Still let him ply his question: “By
what means may sin be discovered in an infant?” He may find an answer in
the inspired pages: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned.” “Through
the offence of one many are dead.” “The judgment was from one to
condemnation.” “By one man’s offence death reigned by one.” “By the
offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation.” “By one
man’s disobedience many were made sinners.” <span
id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) Behold, then, “by what means sins
may be discovered in an infant.” Let him now believe in original sin;
let him permit infants to come to Christ, that they may be saved.
\[XXVIII.\] What means this passage of his: “He sins not who is born; he
sins not who begat him; He sins not who created him. Amidst these
intrenchments of innocence, therefore, what are the breaches through
which you pretend that sin entered?” Why does he search for a hidden
chink when he has an open door? “By one man,” says the apostle; “through
the offence of one,” says the apostle; “By one man’s disobedience,” says
the apostle. What does he want more? What does he require plainer? What
does he expect to be more impressively repeated?
