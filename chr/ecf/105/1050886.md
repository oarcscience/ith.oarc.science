<span id="xviii.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Why the Righteousness Which is
of the Law is Valued Slightly by Paul.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xx-p2"></span>Therefore the blessed Paul casts away
those past attainments of his righteousness, as “losses” and “dung,”
that “he may win Christ and be found in Him, not having his own
righteousness, which is of the law.” Wherefore his own, if it <span
id="page_412">p. 412</span> <span id="xviii.v.xx-Page_412"></span>is of
the law? For that law is the law of God. Who has denied this, save
Marcion and Manicheus, and such like pests? Since, then, that is the law
of God, he says it is “his own” righteousness “which is of the law;” and
this righteousness of his own he would not have, but cast it forth as
“dung.” Why so, except because it is this which I have above
demonstrated, <span id="fr_2753"></span>[2754](#fn_2753.md) that those are
under the law who, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and going
about to establish their own, are not subject to the righteousness of
God? <span id="fr_2754"></span>[2755](#fn_2754.md) For they think that, by
the strength of their own will, they will fulfil the commands of the
law; and wrapped up in their pride, they are not converted to assisting
grace. Thus the letter killeth <span
id="fr_2755"></span>[2756](#fn_2755.md) them either openly, as being guilty
to themselves, by not doing what the law commands; or by thinking that
they do it, although they do it not with spiritual love, which is of
God. Thus they remain either plainly wicked or deceitfully
righteous,—manifestly cut off in open unrighteousness, or foolishly
elated in fallacious righteousness. And by this means—marvellous indeed,
but yet true—the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by the
righteousness which is in the law, or by the law, but by that which is
in the Spirit of grace. Because the righteousness of the law is
fulfilled in those, as it is written, who walk not according to the
flesh, but according to the Spirit. But, according to the righteousness
which is in the law, the apostle says that he was blameless in the
flesh, not in the Spirit; and he says that the righteousness which is of
the law was his, not God’s. It must be understood, therefore, that the
righteousness of the law is not fulfilled according to the righteousness
which is in the law or of the law, that is, according to the
righteousness of man, but according to the righteousness which is in the
Spirit of grace, therefore according to the righteousness of God, that
is, which man has from God. Which may be thus more clearly and briefly
stated: That the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled when the law
commands, and man as it were of his own strength obeys; but when the
Spirit aids, and man’s free will, but freed by the grace of God,
performs. Therefore the righteousness of the law is to command what is
pleasing to God, to forbid what is displeasing; but the righteousness in
the law is to obey the letter, and beyond it to seek for no assistance
of God for holy living. For when he had said, “Not having my own
righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of
Christ,” he added, “Which is from God.” That, therefore, is itself the
righteousness of God, being ignorant of which the proud go about to
establish their own; for it is not called the righteousness of God
because by it God is righteous, but because man has it from God.
