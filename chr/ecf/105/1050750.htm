<p><a name="xvii.vi.xviii-p2"></A>Again, if you wish to be a catholic, I pray you, neither believe, nor say, nor teach that &#8220;the sacrifice of Christians ought to be offered in behalf of those who have departed out of the body without having been baptized.&#8221; Because you fail to show that the sacrifice of the Jews, which you have quoted out of the books of the Maccabees,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2451"></A><A HREF="#fn_2451"><FONT SIZE="1">2452</FONT></A>
 was offered in behalf of any who had departed this life without circumcision. In this novel opinion of yours, which you have advanced against the authority and teaching of the whole Church, you have used a very arrogant mode of expression. You say, &#8220;In behalf of these, I most certainly decide that constant oblations and incessant sacrifices must be offered up on the part of the holy priests.&#8221; Here you show, as a layman, no submission to God&#146;s priests for instruction; nor do you associate yourself with them (the least you could do) for inquiry; but you put yourself before them by your proud assumption of judgment. Away, my son, with all this pretension; men walk not so arrogantly in the Way, which the Humble Christ taught that He Himself is.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2452"></A><A HREF="#fn_2452"><FONT SIZE="1">2453</FONT></A>
 No man enters through His narrow gate with so proud a disposition as this.</p>
