<span id="xx.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Perseverance is Given to the
End.</span>

<span id="xx.xviii-p2"></span>Rightly follows the word to the kingdom of
the elect: “If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how has He not also with
Him given us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s
elect? God who justifieth? Who condemneth? Christ who died? yea, rather
who rose again also, who is at the right hand of God, who also
soliciteth on our behalf?” <span id="fr_3298"></span>[3299](#fn_3298)
And of how stedfast a perseverance even to the end they have received
the gift, let them follow on to say: “Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, Because for
thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for
the slaughter. But in all these things we are more than conquerors,
through Him that hath loved us. For I am certain, that neither death,
nor life, nor angel, nor principality, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord.” <span id="fr_3299"></span>[3300](#fn_3299)
