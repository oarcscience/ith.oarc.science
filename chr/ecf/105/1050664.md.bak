id="xvi.vi.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 57 \[XXXIV.\]—The Great Sin of the
First Man.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.lviii-p2"></span>Now observe what follows, as he goes
on to say: “If, before sin, God created a source from which men should
be born, but the devil a source from which parents were disturbed, then
beyond a doubt holiness must be ascribed to those that are born, and
guilt to those that produce. Since, however, this would be a most
manifest condemnation of marriage; remove, I pray you, this view from
the midst of the churches, and really believe that all things were made
by Jesus Christ, and that without Him nothing was made.” <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) He so speaks here, as if he would
make us say, that there is a something in man’s substance which was
created by the devil. The devil persuaded evil as a sin; he did not
create it as a nature. No doubt he persuaded nature for man is nature;
and therefore by his persuasion he corrupted it. He who wounds a limb
does not, of course, create it, but he injures it. <span
id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) Those wounds, indeed, which are
inflicted on the body produce lameness in a limb, or difficulty of
motion; but they do not affect the virtue whereby a man becomes
righteous: that wound, however, which has the name of sin, wounds the
very life, which was being righteously lived. This wound was at that
fatal moment of the fall inflicted by the devil to a vastly wider and
deeper extent than are the sins which are known amongst men. Whence it
came to pass, that our nature having then and there been deteriorated by
that great sin of the first man, not only was made a sinner, but also
generates sinners; and yet the very weakness, under which the virtue of
a holy life has drooped and died, is not really nature, but corruption;
precisely as a bad state of health is not a bodily substance or nature,
but disorder; very often, indeed, if not always, the ailing character of
parents is in a certain way implanted, and reappears in the bodies of
their children.
