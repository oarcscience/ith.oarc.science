<span id="xiii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—(21.) To Whom God’s Commandments
are Grievous; And to Whom, Not. Why Scripture Says that God’s
Commandments are Not Grievous; A Commandment is a Proof of the Freedom
Of Man’s Will; Prayer is a Proof of Grace.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxv-p2"></span>He next quotes passages to show that God’s
commandments are not grievous. But who can be ignorant of the fact that,
since the generic commandment is love (for “the end of the commandment
is love,” <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) and “love is the
fulfilling of the law” <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446) .md),
whatever is accomplished by the operation of love, and not of fear, is
not grievous? They, however, are oppressed by the commandments of God,
who try to fulfil them by fearing. “But perfect love casteth out
fear;” <span id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) and, in respect of the
burden of the commandment, it not only takes off the pressure of its
heavy weight, but it actually lifts it up as if on wings. In order,
however, that this love may be possessed, even as far as it can possibly
be possessed in the body of this death, the determination of will avails
but little, unless it be helped by God’s grace through our Lord Jesus
Christ. For as it must again and again be stated, it is “shed abroad in
our hearts,” not by our own selves, but “by the Holy Ghost which is
given unto us.” <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) And for no
other reason does Holy Scripture insist on the truth that God’s
commandments are not grievous, than this, that the soul which finds them
grievous may understand that it has not yet received those resources
which make the Lord’s commandments to be such as they are commended to
us as being, even gentle and pleasant; and that it may pray with
groaning of the will to obtain the gift of facility. For the man who
says, “Let my heart be blameless;”  <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) and, “Order Thou my steps according
to Thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me;” <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) and, “Thy will be done in earth, as
it is in heaven;” <span id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) and, “Lead
us not into temptation;” <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) and
other prayers of a like purport, which it would be too long to
particularize, does in effect offer up a prayer for ability to keep
God’s commandments. Neither, indeed, on the one hand, would any
injunctions be laid upon us to keep them, if our own will had nothing to
do in the matter; nor, on the other hand, would there be any room for
prayer, if our will were alone sufficient. God’s commandments,
therefore, are commended to us as being not grievous, in order that he
to whom they are grievous may understand that he has not as yet received
the gift which removes their grievousness; and that he may not think
that he is really performing them, when he so keeps them that they are
grievous to him. For it is a cheerful giver whom God loves. <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) Nevertheless, when a man finds
God’s commandments grievous, let him not be broken down by despair; let
him rather oblige himself to seek, to ask, and to knock.
