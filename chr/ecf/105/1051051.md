<span id="xxi.ii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—It is Believers that are Taught
of God.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xv-p2"></span>“Why,” say they, “does He not teach all
men?” If we should say that they whom He does not teach are unwilling to
learn, we shall be met with the answer: And what becomes of what is said
to Him, “O God, Thou wilt turn us again, and quicken us”? <span
id="fr_3474"></span>[3475](#fn_3474) Or if God does not make men willing
who were not willing, on what principle does the Church pray, according
to the Lord’s commandment, for her persecutors? For thus also the
blessed Cyprian <span id="fr_3475"></span>[3476](#fn_3475) would have it
to be understood that we say, “Thy will be done, as in heaven so in
earth,”—that is, as in those who have already believed, and who are, as
it were, *heaven*, so also in those who do not believe, and on this
account are still *the earth.* What, then, do we pray for on behalf of
those who are unwilling to believe, except that God would work in them
to will also? Certainly the apostle says, “Brethren, my heart’s good
will, indeed, and my prayer to God for them, is for their
salvation.” <span id="fr_3476"></span>[3477](#fn_3476) He prays for
those who do not believe,—for what, except <span id="page_506">p.
506</span> <span id="xxi.ii.xv-Page_506"></span>that they may believe?
For in no other way do they obtain salvation. If, then, the faith of the
petitioners precede the grace of God, does the faith of them on whose
behalf prayer is made that they may believe precede the grace of
God?—since this is the very thing that is besought for them, that on
them that believe not—that is, who have not faith—faith itself may be
bestowed? When, therefore, the gospel is preached, some believe, some
believe not; but they who believe at the voice of the preacher from
without, hear of the Father from within, and learn; while they who do
not believe, hear outwardly, but inwardly do not hear nor learn;—that is
to say, to the former it is given to believe; to the latter it is not
given. Because “no man,” says He, “cometh to me, except the Father which
sent me draw him.” <span id="fr_3477"></span>[3478](#fn_3477) And this
is more plainly said afterwards. For after a little time, when He was
speaking of eating his flesh and drinking His blood, and some even of
His disciples said, “This is a hard saying, who can hear it? Jesus,
knowing in Himself that His disciples murmured at this, said unto them,
Doth this offend you?” <span id="fr_3478"></span>[3479](#fn_3478) And a
little after He said, “The words that I have spoken unto you are spirit
and life; but there are some among you which believe not.” <span
id="fr_3479"></span>[3480](#fn_3479) And immediately the evangelist
says, “For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the believers, and who
should betray Him; and He said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man
can come unto me except it were given him of my Father.” Therefore, to
be drawn to Christ by the Father, and to hear and learn of the Father in
order to come to Christ, is nothing else than to receive from the Father
the gift by which to believe in Christ. For it was not the hearers of
the gospel that were distinguished from those who did not hear, but the
believers from those who did not believe, by Him who said, “No man
cometh to me except it were given him of my Father.”
