<span id="xi.lxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 58.—The Free Will of Man is an
Intermediate Power.</span>

<span id="xi.lxi-p2"></span>Let us then, first of all, lay down this
proposition, and see whether it satisfies the question before us: that
free will, naturally assigned by the Creator to our rational soul, is
such a neutral <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) power, as can
either incline towards faith, or turn towards unbelief. Consequently a
man cannot be said to have even that will with which he believes in God,
without having received it; since this rises at the call of God out of
the free will which he received naturally when he was created. God no
doubt wishes all men to be saved <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md) and to come into the knowledge of
the truth; but yet not so as to take away from them free will, for the
good or the evil use of which they may be most righteously judged. This
being the case, unbelievers indeed do contrary to the will of God when
they do not believe His gospel; nevertheless they do not therefore
overcome His will, but rob their own selves of the great, nay, the very
greatest, good, and implicate themselves in penalties of punishment,
destined to experience the power of Him in punishments whose mercy in
His gifts they despised. Thus God’s will is for ever invincible; but it
would be vanquished, unless it devised what to do with such as despised
it, or if these despises could in any way escape from the retribution
which He has appointed for such as they. Suppose a master, for example,
who should say to his servants, I wish you to labour in my vineyard,
and, after your work is done, to feast and take your rest but who, at
the same time, should require any who refused to work to grind in the
mill ever after. Whoever neglected such a command would evidently act
contrary to the master’s will; but he would do more than that,—he would
vanquish that will, if he also escaped the mill. This, however, cannot
possibly happen under the government of God. Whence it is written, “God
hath spoken once,”—that is, irrevocably,—although the passage may refer
also to His one only Word. <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) He
then adds what it is which He had irrevocably uttered, saying: “Twice
have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God. Also unto Thee, O
Lord, doth mercy belong: because Thou wilt render to every man according
to his work.” <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) He therefore
will be guilty unto condemnation under God’s power, who shall think too
contemptuously of His mercy to believe in Him. But whosoever shall put
his trust in Him, and yield himself up to Him, for the forgiveness of
all his sins, for the cure of all his corruption, and for the kindling
and illumination of his soul by His warmth and light, shall have good
works by his grace; and by them <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) he shall be even in his body
redeemed from the corruption of death, crowned, satisfied with
blessings,—not temporal, but eternal,—above what we can ask or
understand.
