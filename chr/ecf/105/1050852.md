<span id="xviii.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Why the Pelagians Falsely Accuse
Catholics of Maintaining Fate Under the Name of Grace.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.x-p2"></span>But, as I was somewhat more attentively
considering for what reason they should think it well to object this to
us, that we assert fate under the name of grace, I first of all looked
into those words of theirs which follow. For thus they have thought that
this was to be objected to us: “Under the name,” say they, “of grace,
they so assert fate as to say that unless God inspired unwilling and
resisting man with the desire of good, and that good imperfect, he would
neither be able to decline from evil nor to lay hold of good.” Then a
little after, where they mention what they maintain, I gave heed to what
was said by them about this matter. “We confess,” say they, that baptism
is necessary for all ages, and that grace, moreover, assists the good
purpose of everybody; but yet that it does not infuse the love of virtue
into a reluctant one, because there is no acceptance of persons with
God.” <span id="fr_2634"></span>[2635](#fn_2634) From these words of
theirs, I perceived that for this reason they either think, or wish it
to be thought, that we assert fate under the name of grace, because we
say that God’s grace is not given in respect of our merits, but
according to His own most merciful will, in that He said, “I will be
gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will
show mercy.” <span id="fr_2635"></span>[2636](#fn_2635) Where, by way of
consequence, it is added, “Therefore it is not of him that willeth, nor
of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.” <span
id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636) Here any one might be equally
foolish in thinking or saying that the apostle is an assertor of fate.
But here these people sufficiently lay themselves open; for when they
malign us by saying that we maintain fate under the name of grace,
because we say that God’s grace is not given on account of our merits,
beyond a doubt they confess that they themselves say that it is given on
account of our merits; thus their blindness could not conceal and
dissimulate that they believe and think thus, although, when this view
was objected to him, Pelagius, in the episcopal judgment of Palestine,
with crafty fear condemned it. For it was objected to him from the words
of his own disciple Cœlestius, indeed, that he himself also was in the
habit of saying that God’s grace is given on account of our merits. And
he in abhorrence, or in pretended abhorrence, of this, did not delay,
with his lips at least, to anathematize it; <span
id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637) but, as his later writings
indicate, and the assertion of those followers of his makes evident, he
kept it in his deceitful heart, until afterwards his boldness might put
forth in letters <span id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638) what the
cunning of a denier had then hidden for fear. And still the Pelagian
bishops do not dread, and at least are not ashamed, to send their
letters to the catholic Eastern bishops, in which they charge us with
being assertors of fate because we do not say that even grace is given
according to our merits; although Pelagius, fearing the Eastern bishops,
did not dare to say this, and so was compelled to condemn it.
