<span id="xv.iii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26 \[XXV.\]—The Pelagian Grace of
“Capacity” Exploded. The Scripture Teaches the Need of God’s Help in
Doing, Speaking, and Thinking, Alike.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>Let Pelagius, therefore, cease at last
to deceive both himself and others by his disputations against the grace
of God. It is not on account of only one of these three <span
id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) —that is to say, of the “capacity”
of a good will and work—that the grace of God towards us ought to be
proclaimed; but also on account of the good “will” and “work”
themselves. This “capacity,” indeed, according to his definition, avails
for both directions; and yet our sins must not also be attributed to God
in consequence, as our good actions, according to his view, are
attributed to Him owing to the same capacity. It is not only, therefore,
on this account that the help of God’s grace is maintained, because it
assists our natural capacity. He must cease to say, “That we are able to
do, say, think any good, is from Him who has given us this ability, and
who also assists this ability; whereas that we really do a good thing,
or speak a good word, or think a good thought, proceeds from our own
selves.” He must, I repeat, cease to say this. For God has not only
given us the ability and aids it, but He further works in us “to will
and to do.”  <span id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) It is not
because we do not will, or do not do, that we will and do nothing good,
but because we are without His help. How can he say, “That we are able
to do good is of God, but that we actually do it is of ourselves,” when
the apostle tells us that he “prays to God” in behalf of those to whom
he was writing, “that they should do no evil, but that they should do
that which is good?” <span id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) His
words are not, “We pray that ye *be able* to do nothing evil;” but,
“that ye do no evil.” Neither does he say, “that *ye be able* to do
good;” but, “that ye do good.” Forasmuch as it is written, “As many as
are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God,” <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) it follows that, in order that they
may do that which is good, they must be led by Him who is good. How can
Pelagius say, “That we are able to make a good use of speech comes from
God; but that we do actually make this good use of speech proceeds from
ourselves,” when the Lord declares, “It is the Spirit of your Father
which speaketh in you”? <span id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) He
does not say, “It is not you who have given to yourselves the power of
speaking well;” but His words are, “It is not ye that speak.” <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) Nor does He say, “It is the Spirit
of your Father which *giveth*, or *hath given, you the power* to speak
well;” but He says, “which speaketh in you.” He does not allude to the
motion <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) of “the capacity,” but
He asserts the effect of the co-operation. How can this arrogant
asserter of free will say, “That we are able to think a good thought
comes from God, but that we actually think a good thought proceeds from
ourselves”? He has his answer from the humble preacher of grace, who
says, “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of
ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.” <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) Observe he does not say, “*to be
able* to think anything;” but, “to think anything.”
