<span id="xvii.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[VII.\]—Victor Entangles Himself
in an Exceedingly Difficult Question. God’s Foreknowledge is No Cause of
Sin.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.vii-p2"></span>In another passage, also, on proposing
for explanation the very same question in which he had entangled
himself, he says, speaking in the person of certain objectors: “Why,
they ask, did God inflict upon the soul so unjust a punishment as to be
willing to relegate it into a body, when, by reason of its association
with the flesh, that begins to be sinful which could not have been
sinful?” Now, amidst the reefy sea of such a question, it was surely his
duty to beware of shipwreck; nor to commit himself to dangers which he
could not hope to escape by passing over them, and where his only chance
of safety lay in putting back again—in a word, by repentance. He tries
to free himself by means of the foreknowledge of God, but to no purpose.
For God’s foreknowledge only marks beforehand those sinners whom He
purposes to heal. For if He liberates from sin those souls which He
Himself involved in sin when <span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="xvii.iv.vii-Page_318"></span>innocent and pure, He then heals a
wound which Himself inflicted on us, not which He found in us. May God,
however, forbid it, and may it be altogether far from us to say, that
when God cleanses the souls of infants by the laver of regeneration, He
then corrects evils which He Himself made for them, when He commingled
them, which had no sin before, with sinful flesh, that they might be
contaminated by its original sin. As regards, however, the souls which
this calumniator alleges to have deserved pollution by the flesh, he is
quite unable to tell us how it is they deserved so vast an evil,
previous to their connection with the flesh.
