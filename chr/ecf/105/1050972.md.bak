<span id="xix.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—We Would Not Love God Unless
He First Loved Us. The Apostles Chose Christ Because They Were Chosen;
They Were Not Chosen Because They Chose Christ.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span>Let no one, then, deceive you, my
brethren, for we should not love God unless He first loved us. John
again gives us the plainest proof of this when he says, “We love Him
because He first loved us.” <span id="fr_3167"></span>[3168](#fn_3167.md)
Grace makes us lovers of the law; but the law itself, without grace,
makes us nothing but breakers of the law. And nothing else than this is
shown us by the words of our Lord when He says to His disciples, Ye have
not chosen me, but I have chosen you.” <span
id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168.md) For if we first loved Him, in order
that by this merit He might love us, then we first chose Him that we
might deserve to be chosen by Him. He, however, who is the Truth says
otherwise, and flatly contradicts this vain conceit of men. “You have
not chosen me,” <span id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span
id="xix.iv.xxxviii-Page_460"></span>He says. If, therefore, you have not
chosen me, undoubtedly you have not loved me (for how could they choose
one whom they did not love?). “But I,” says He, “have chosen you.” And
then could they possibly help choosing Him afterwards, and preferring
Him to all the blessings of this world? But it was because they had been
chosen, that they chose Him; not because they chose Him that they were
chosen. There could be no merit in men’s choice of Christ, if it were
not that God’s grace was prevenient in His choosing them. Whence the
Apostle Paul pronounces in the Thessalonians this benediction: “The Lord
make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward
all men.”  <span id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169.md) This benediction
to love one another He gave us, who had also given us a law that we
should love each other. Then, in another passage addressed to the same
church, seeing that there now existed in some of its members the
disposition which he had wished them to cultivate, he says, “We are
bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that
your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all
toward each other aboundeth.”  <span
id="fr_3170"></span>[3171](#fn_3170.md) This he said lest they should make
a boast of the great good which they were enjoying from God, as if they
had it of their own mere selves. Because, then, your faith has so great
a growth (this is the purport of his words), and the love of every one
of you all toward each other so greatly abounds, we ought to thank God
concerning you, but not to praise you, as if you possessed these gifts
of yourselves.
