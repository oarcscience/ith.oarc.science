Pelagius and His Profession of Faith.</span>

<span id="xiv.xlvii-p2"></span>After all these sentences were read out,
the synod said: “What says the monk Pelagius to all these heads of
opinion which have been read in his presence? For this holy synod
condemns the whole, as does also God’s Holy Catholic Church.” Pelagius
answered: “I say again, that these opinions, even according to their own
testimony, are not mine; nor for them, as I have already said, ought I
to be held responsible. The opinions which I have confessed to be my
own, I maintain are sound; those, however, which I have said are not my
own, I reject according to the judgment of this holy synod, pronouncing
anathema on every man who opposes and gainsays the doctrines of the Holy
Catholic Church. For I believe in the Trinity of the one substance, and
I hold all things in accordance with the teaching of the Holy Catholic
Church. If indeed any man entertains opinions different from her, let
him be anathema.”
