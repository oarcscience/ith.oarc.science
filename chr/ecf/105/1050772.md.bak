id="xvii.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Ignorance is Better Than
Error. Predestination to Eternal Life, and Predestination to Eternal
Death.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xvi-p2"></span>Do not, my son, let senile timidity
displease your youthful confidence. For my own part, indeed, if I proved
unequal, either under the teaching of God or of some spiritual
instructor, to the task of understanding the subject of our present
inquiry on the origin of souls, I am more prepared to vindicate God’s
righteous will, that we should remain in ignorance on this point, as on
many others, than to say in my rashness what either is so obscure that I
can neither bring it home to the intelligence of other people, nor
understand it myself; or certainly even to help the cause of the
heretics who endeavour to persuade us that the souls of infants are
entirely free from guilt, on the ground, forsooth, that such guilt would
only recoil on God as its Author, for having compelled innocent souls
(for the help of which He knew beforehand no laver of regeneration was
prepared) to become sinful, by assigning them to sinful flesh without
any provision for that grace of baptism which should prevent their
incurring eternal damnation. For the fact undoubtedly is, that
numberless souls of infants pass out of the body before they are
baptized. God forbid that I should cast about for any futile effort to
dilute this stern fact, and say what you have yourself said: “That the
soul deserved to be polluted by the flesh, and to become sinful, though
it previously had no sin, by reason of which it could be rightly said to
have incurred this desert.” And again: “That even without baptism
original sins may be remitted.” And once more: “That even the kingdom of
heaven is at last bestowed on those who have not been baptized.” Now, if
I were not afraid to utter these and similar poisonous allegations
against the faith, I should probably not be afraid to propound some
definite theory on this subject. How much better, then, is it, that I
should not separately dispute and affirm about the soul, what I am
ignorant of; but simply hold what I see the apostle has most plainly
taught us: That owing to one man all pass into condemnation who are born
of Adam <span id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md) unless they are born
again in Christ, even as He has appointed them to be regenerated, before
they die in the body, whom He predestinated to everlasting life, as the
most merciful bestower of grace; whilst to those whom He has
predestinated to eternal death, He is also the most righteous awarder of
punishment not only on account of the sins which they add in the
indulgence of their own will, but also because of their original sin,
even if, as in the case of infants, they add nothing thereto. Now this
is my definite view on that question, so that the hidden things of God
may keep their secret, without impairing my own faith.
