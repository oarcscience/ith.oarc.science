<span id="x.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[XV.\]—Sin is from Natural
Descent, as Righteousness is from Regeneration; How “All” Are Sinners
Through Adam, and “All” Are Just Through Christ.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xix-p2"></span>Now if it is imitation only that makes
men sinners through Adam, why does not imitation likewise alone make men
righteous through Christ? “For,” he says, “as by the offence of one upon
all men to condemnation; even so by the justification of one upon all
men unto justification of life.” <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266)
\[On the theory of imitation\], then, the “*one*” and the “*one*,” here,
must not be regarded as Adam and Christ, but Adam and Abel. For although
many sinners have preceded us in the time of this present life, and have
been imitated in their sin by those who have sinned at a later date, yet
they will have it, that only Adam is mentioned as he in whom all have
sinned by imitation, since he was the first of men who sinned. And on
the same principle, Abel ought certainly to have been mentioned, as he
“in which one” all likewise are justified by imitation, inasmuch as he
was himself the first man who lived justly. If, however, it be thought
necessary to take into the account some critical period having relation
to the beginning of the New Testament, and Christ be taken as the leader
of the righteous and the object of their imitation, then Judas, who
betrayed Him, ought to be set down as the leader of the class of
sinners. Moreover, if Christ alone is He in whom all men are justified,
on the ground that it is not simply the imitation of His example which
makes men just, but His grace which regenerates men by the Spirit, then
also Adam is the only one in whom all have sinned, on the ground that it
is not the mere following of his evil example that makes men sinners,
but the penalty which generates through the flesh. Hence the terms “*all
men*” and “*all men*.” For not they who are generated through Adam are
actually the very same as those who are regenerated through Christ; but
yet the language of the apostle is strictly correct, because as none
partakes of carnal generation except through Adam, so no one shares in
the spiritual except through Christ. For if any could be generated in
the flesh, yet not by Adam; and if in like manner any could be generated
in the Spirit, and not by Christ; clearly “*all*” could not be spoken of
either in the one class or in the other. But these “*all*” <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267) the apostle afterwards describes as
“*many*;” <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268) for obviously, under
certain circumstances, the “all” may be but a few. The carnal
generation, however, embraces “*many*,” and the spiritual generation
also includes “*many*;” although the “many” of the spiritual are less
numerous than the “many” of the carnal. But as the one embraces *all*
men whatever, so the other includes *all* righteous men; because as in
the former case none can be a man without the carnal generation, so in
the other class no one can be a righteous man without the spiritual
generation; in both instances, therefore, there are “many:” “For as by
the disobedience of one man *many* were made sinners, so by the
obedience of one shall *many* be made righteous.” <span
