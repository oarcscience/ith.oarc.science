id="x.iii.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56.—No One is Reconciled to God
Except Through Christ.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lvi-p2"></span>Taking into account all the inspired
statements which I have quoted,—whether I regard the value of each
passage one by one, or combine their united testimony in an accumulated
witness or even include similar passages which I have not adduced,—there
can be nothing discovered, but that which the catholic Church holds, in
her dutiful vigilance against all profane novelties: that every man is
separated from God, except those who are reconciled to God through
Christ the Mediator; and that no one can be separated from God, except
by sins, which alone cause separation; that there is, therefore, no
reconciliation except by the remission of sins, through the one grace of
the most merciful Saviour,—through the one sacrifice of the most
veritable Priest; and that none who are born of the woman, that trusted
the serpent and so was corrupted through desire, <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) are delivered from the body of this
death, except by the Son of the virgin who believed the angel and so
conceived without desire. <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md)
