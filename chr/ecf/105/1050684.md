<span id="xvii.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[X.\]—Dinocrates, Brother of
the Martyr St. Perpetua, is Said to Have Been Delivered from the State
of Condemnation by the Prayers of the Saint.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xii-p2"></span>Concerning Dinocrates, however, the
brother <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="xvii.iv.xii-Page_320"></span>of St. Perpetua, there is no record in
the canonical Scripture; nor does the saint herself, or whoever it was
that wrote the account, say that the boy, who had died at the age of
seven years, died without baptism; in his behalf she is believed to have
had, when her martyrdom was imminent, her prayers effectually heard that
he should be removed from the penalties of the lost to rest. Now, boys
at that time of life are able both to lie, and, saying the truth, both
to confess and deny. Therefore, when they are baptized they say the
Creed, and answer in their behalf to such questions as are proposed to
them in examination. Who can tell, then, whether that boy, after
baptism, in a time of persecution was estranged from Christ to idolatry
by an impious father, and on that account incurred mortal condemnation,
from which he was only delivered for Christ’s sake, given to the prayers
of his sister when she was at the point of death?
