id="xv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—Cœlestius, on His Trial at
Carthage, Refuses to Condemn His Error; The Written Statement Which He
Gave to Zosimus.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.ii-p2"></span>Cœlestius, indeed, maintained this
erroneous doctrine with less restraint. To such an extent did he push
his freedom as actually to refuse, when on trial before the bishops at
Carthage, <span id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md) to condemn those
who say, “That Adam’s sin injured only Adam himself, and not the human
race; and that infants at their birth are in the same state that Adam
was in before his transgression.” <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) In the written statement, too,
which he presented to the most blessed Pope Zosimus at Rome, he declared
with especial plainness, “that original sin binds no single infant.”
Concerning the ecclesiastical proceedings at Carthage we copy the
following account of his words.

<span id="xv.iv.ii-p4"></span> Pelagius, at Diospolis, condemned this
position of Cœlestius. Hence the comparative restraint of Pelagius, and
the greater freedom in holding the error which is here attributed to
Cœlestius.
