<span id="xxi.ii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[VII.\]—Why the Apostle Said
that We are Justified by Faith and Not by Works.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xii-p2"></span>But perhaps it may be said: “The apostle
distinguishes faith from works; he says, indeed, that grace is not of
works, but he does not say that it is not of faith.” This, indeed, is
true. But Jesus says that faith itself also is the work of God, and
commands us to work it. For the Jews said to Him, “What shall we do that
we may work the work of God? Jesus answered, and said unto them, This is
the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.”  <span
id="fr_3461"></span>[3462](#fn_3461.md) The apostle, therefore,
distinguishes faith from works, just as Judah is distinguished from
Israel in the two kingdoms of the Hebrews, although Judah is Israel
itself. And he says that a man is justified by faith and not by works,
because faith itself is first given, from which may be obtained other
things which are specially characterized as works, in which a man may
live righteously. For he himself also says, “By grace ye are saved
through faith; and this not of yourselves; but it is the gift of
God,” <span id="fr_3462"></span>[3463](#fn_3462.md) —that is to say, “And
in saying ‘through faith,’ even faith itself is not of yourselves, but
is God’s gift.” “Not of works,” he says, “lest any man should be lifted
up.” For it is often said, “He deserved to believe, because he was a
good man even before he believed.” Which may be said of Cornelius <span
id="fr_3463"></span>[3464](#fn_3463.md) since his alms were accepted and
his prayers heard before he had believed on Christ; and yet without some
faith he neither gave alms nor prayed. For how did he call on him on
whom he had not believed? But if he could have been saved without the
faith of Christ the Apostle Peter would not have been sent as an
architect to build him up; although, “Except the Lord build the house,
they labour in vain who build it.” <span
id="fr_3464"></span>[3465](#fn_3464.md) And we are told, Faith is of
ourselves; other things which pertain to works of righteousness are of
the Lord; as if faith did not belong to the building,—as if, I say, the
foundation did not belong to the building. But if this primarily and
especially belongs to it, he labours in vain who seeks to build up the
faith by preaching, unless the Lord in His mercy builds it up from
within. Whatever, therefore, of good works Cornelius performed, as well
before he believed in Christ as when he believed and after he had
believed, are all to be ascribed to God, lest, perchance any man be
lifted up.
