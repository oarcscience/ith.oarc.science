<span id="xvii.vi-p3"></span>Augustin points out to Vincentius Victor
the corrections which he ought to make in his books concerning the
origin of the soul, if he wishes to be a Catholic. Those opinions also
which had been already refuted in the preceding books addressed to
Renatus and Peter, Augustin briefly censures in this third book, which
is written to Victor himself: moreover, he classifies them under eleven
heads of error.
