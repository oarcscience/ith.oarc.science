<span id="xviii.iii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—Desire in Paradise Was
Either None at All, or It Was Obedient to the Impulse of the
Will.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxxv-p2"></span>But whichever you choose of the two
other alternatives, there is no necessity for striving against you with
any disputation. For even if you should refuse to elect the fourth, in
which there is the highest tranquillity of all the obedient members
without any lust, since already the urgency of your arguments has made
you hostile <span id="page_388">p. 388</span> <span
id="xviii.iii.xxxv-Page_388"></span>to it; that will doubtless please
you which I have put in the third place, that that carnal concupiscence,
whose impulse attains to the final pleasure which much delights you,
should never arise in Paradise except at the bidding of the will when it
would be necessary for procreation. If it is agreeable to you to arrange
this in Paradise, and if, by means of such a concupiscence of the flesh
which should neither anticipate, nor impede, nor exceed the bidding of
the will, it appears to you that children could have been begotten, I
have no objection. For, as far as I am concerned in this matter, it is
enough for me that such a concupiscence of the flesh is not now among
men, as you concede there might have been in that place of happiness.
For what it now is, the sense of all men certainly confesses, although
with modesty; because it both solicits with excessive and importunate
uneasiness the chaste, even when they are unwilling and are checking it
by moderation, and frequently withdraws itself from the willing and
inflicts itself on the unwilling; so that, by its disobedience, it
testifies that it is nothing else than the punishment of that first
disobedience. Whence, reasonably, both then the first men when they
covered their nakedness, and now whoever considers himself to be a man,
every no less modest than immodest person is confounded at it—far be it
from us to say by the work of God, but—by the penalty of the first and
ancient sin. You, however, not for the sake of religious reasoning, but
for excited contention,—not on behalf of human modesty, but for your own
madness, that even the concupiscence of the flesh itself should not be
thought to be currupted, and original sin to be derived from it,—are
endeavouring by your argument to recall it absolutely, such as it now
is, into Paradise; and to contend that that concupiscence could have
been there which would either always be followed by a disgraceful
consent, or would sometimes be restrained by a pitiable refusal. I,
however, do not greatly care what it delights you to think of it. Still,
whatever of men is born by its means, if he is not born again, without
doubt he is damned; and he must be under the dominion of the devil, if
he is not delivered thence by Christ.
