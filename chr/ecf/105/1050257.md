id="xii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[IX.\]—He Could Not Be Justified,
Who Had Not Heard of the Name of Christ; Rendering the Cross of Christ
of None Effect.</span>

<span id="xii.xiv-p2"></span>But they say: “He is not condemned; because
the statement that all sinned in Adam, was not made because of the sin
which is derived from one’s birth, but because of imitation of him.” If,
therefore, Adam is said to be the author of all the sins which followed
his own, because he was the first sinner of the human race, then how is
it that Abel, rather than Christ, is not placed at the head of all the
righteous, because he was the first righteous man? But I am not speaking
of the case of an infant. I take the instance of a young man, or an old
man, who has died in a region where he could not hear of the name of
Christ. Well, could such a man have become righteous by nature and free
will; or could he not? If they contend that he could, then see what it
is to render the cross of Christ of none effect, <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149) to contend that any man without it,
can be justified by the law of nature and the power of his will. We may
here also say, then is Christ dead in vain <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150) forasmuch as all might accomplish
so much as this, even if He had never died; and if they should be
unrighteous, they would be so because they wished to be, not because
they were unable to be righteous. But even though a man could not be
justified at all without the grace of Christ, he would absolve him, if
he dared, in accordance with his words, to the effect that, “if a man
were of such a character, because he could not possibly have been of any
other, he would be free from all blame.”
