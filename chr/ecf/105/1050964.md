<span id="xix.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—The Grace by Which the Stony
Heart is Removed is Not Preceded by Good Deserts, But by Evil
Ones.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxx-p2"></span>In another passage, also, by the same
prophet, God, in the clearest language, shows us that it is not owing to
any good merits on the part of men, but for His own name’s sake, that He
does these things. This is His language: “This I do, O house of
Israel, <span id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) but for mine holy
name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.
And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen,
which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know
that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in
you before their eyes. For I will take you from among the heathen, and
gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
Then will I sprinkle you with clean water, and ye shall be clean: from
all your own filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you. A
new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you;
and the stony heart shall be taken away out of your flesh, and I will
give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and will
cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do
them.” <span id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) Now who is so blind as
not to see, and who so stone-like as not to feel, that this grace is not
given according to the merits of a good will, when the Lord declares and
testifies, “It is I, O house of Israel, who do this, but for my holy
name’s sake”? Now why did He say “It is I that do it, but for my holy
name’s sake,” were it not that they should not think that it was owing
to their own good merits that these things were happening, as the
Pelagians hesitate not unblushingly to say? But there were not only no
good merits of theirs, but the Lord shows that evil ones actually
preceded; for He says, “But for my holy name’s sake, *which ye have
profaned among the heathen*.” Who can fail to observe how dreadful is
the evil of profaning the Lord’s own holy name? And yet, for the sake of
this very name of mine, says He, which ye have profaned, I, even I, will
make you good, but not for your own sakes; and, as He adds, “I will
sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye
have profaned in the midst of them.” He says that He sanctifies His
name, which He had already declared to be holy. Therefore, this is just
what we pray for in the Lord’s Prayer—“Hallowed be Thy name.” <span
id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md) We ask for the hallowing among men
of that which is in itself undoubtedly always holy. Then it follows,
“And the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when
I shall be sanctified in you.” Although, then, He is Himself always
holy, He is, nevertheless, sanctified in those on whom He bestows His
grace, by taking from them that stony heart by which they profaned the
name of the Lord.

\[The word-play is significant in the Latin: “He says that he sanctifies
(*sanctificare*) His name which He had already declared to be Holy
(*sanctum*).” This is, therefore, what we pray for in the Lord’s Prayer
when we say, “Hallowed (*sanctificatur*) be thy name,” etc.—W.\]
