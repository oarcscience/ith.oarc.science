<span id="xxi.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—Of His Own Will a Man Forsakes
God, So that He is Deservedly Forsaken of Him.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xiv-p2"></span>But, on the other hand, “of his own
will a man forsakes God, so as to be deservedly forsaken by God.” Who
would deny this? But it is for that reason we ask not to be led into
temptation, so that this may not happen. And if we are heard, certainly
it does not happen, because God does not allow it to happen. For <span
id="page_530">p. 530</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.xiv-Page_530"></span>nothing comes to pass except what
either He Himself does, or Himself allows to be done. Therefore He is
powerful both to turn wills from evil to good, and to convert those that
are inclined to fall, or to direct them into a way pleasing to Himself.
For to Him it is not said in vain, “O God, Thou shalt turn again and
quicken us;” <span id="fr_3578"></span>[3579](#fn_3578.md) it is not vainly
said, “Give not my foot to be moved;” <span
id="fr_3579"></span>[3580](#fn_3579.md) it is not vainly said, “Give me not
over, O Lord, from my desire to the sinner;” <span
id="fr_3580"></span>[3581](#fn_3580.md) finally, not to mention many
passages, since probably more may occur to you, it is not vainly said,
“Lead us not into temptation.” <span
id="fr_3581"></span>[3582](#fn_3581.md) For whoever is not led into
temptation, certainly is not led into the temptation of his own evil
will; and he who is not led into the temptation of his own evil will, is
absolutely led into no temptation. For “every one is tempted,” as it is
written, “when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed;” <span
id="fr_3582"></span>[3583](#fn_3582.md) “but God tempteth no man,” <span
id="fr_3583"></span>[3584](#fn_3583.md) —that is to say, with a hurtful
temptation. For temptation is moreover beneficial by which we are not
deceived or overwhelmed, but proved, according to that which is said,
“Prove me, O Lord, and try me.” <span
id="fr_3584"></span>[3585](#fn_3584.md) Therefore, with that hurtful
temptation which the apostle signifies when he says, “Lest by some means
the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain,” <span
id="fr_3585"></span>[3586](#fn_3585.md) “God tempteth no man,” as I have
said,—that is, He brings or leads no one into temptation. For to be
tempted and not to be led into temptation is not evil,—nay, it is even
good; for this it is to be proved. When, therefore, we say to God, “Lead
us not into temptation,” what do we say but, “Permit us not to be led”?
Whence some pray in this manner, and it is read in many codices, and the
most blessed Cyprian thus uses it: “Do not suffer us to be led into
temptation.” In the Greek gospel, however, I have never found it
otherwise than, “Lead us not into temptation.” We live, therefore, more
securely if we give up the whole to God, and do not entrust ourselves
partly to Him and partly to ourselves, as that venerable martyr saw. For
when he would expound the same clause of the prayer, he says among other
things, “But when we ask that we may not come into temptation, we are
reminded of our infirmity and weakness while we thus ask, lest any
should insolently vaunt himself,—lest any should proudly and arrogantly
assume anything to himself,—lest any should take to himself the glory
either of confession or suffering as his own; since the Lord Himself,
teaching humility, said, ‘Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
temptation; the Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.’ So
that when a humble and submissive confession comes first and all is
attributed to God, whatever is sought for suppliantly, with the fear of
God, may be granted by His own loving-kindness.” <span
