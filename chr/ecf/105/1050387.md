id="xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[I.\]—The First Item in the
Accusation, and Pelagius’ Answer.</span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p2"></span>First of all, then, I offer to the Lord my
God, who is also my defence and guide, unspeakable thanks, because I was
not misled in my views respecting our holy brethren and fellow-bishops
who sat as judges in that case. His answers, indeed, they not without
reason approved; because they had not to consider how he had in his
writings stated the points which were objected against him, but what he
had to say about them in his reply at the pending examination. A case of
unsoundness in the faith is one thing, one of incautious statement is
another thing. Now sundry objections were urged against Pelagius out of
a written complaint, which our holy brethren and fellow-bishops in Gaul,
Heros and Lazarus, presented, being themselves unable to be present,
owing (as we afterwards learned from credible information) to the severe
indisposition of one of them. The first of these was, that he writes, in
a certain book of his, this: “No man can be <span id="page_184">p.
184</span> <span id="xiv.vi-Page_184"></span>without sin unless he has
acquired a knowledge of the law.” After this had been read out, the
synod inquired: “Did you, Pelagius, express yourself thus?” Then in
answer he said: “I certainly used the words, but not in the sense in
which they understand them. I did not say that a man is unable to sin
who has acquired a knowledge of the law; but that he is by the knowledge
of the law assisted towards not sinning, even as it is written, ‘He hath
given them a law for help’”  <span id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md)
Upon hearing this, the synod declared: “The words which have been spoken
by Pelagius are not different from the Church.” Assuredly they are not
different, as he expressed them in his answer; the statement, however,
which was produced from his book has a different meaning. But this the
bishops, who were Greek-speaking men, and who heard the words through an
interpreter, were not concerned with discussing. All they had to
consider at the moment was, what the man who was under examination said
was his meaning,—not in what words his opinion was alleged to have been
expressed in his book.
