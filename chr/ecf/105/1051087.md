Lord’s Prayer.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.vii-p2"></span>What, when we say, “Thy kingdom come,”
do we ask else, but that that should also come to us which we do not
doubt will come to all saints? And therefore here also, what do they who
are already holy pray for, save that they may persevere in that holiness
which has been given them? For no otherwise will the kingdom of God come
to them; which it is certain will come not to others, but to those who
persevere to the end.
