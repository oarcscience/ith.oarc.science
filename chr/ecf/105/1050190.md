id="xi.xvii-p1.2"></span>14.—In What Respect the Pelagians Acknowledge
God as the Author of Our Justification.</span>

<span id="xi.xvii-p2"></span>“But,” say they, “we do praise God as the
Author of our righteousness, in that He gave the law, by the teaching of
which we have learned how we ought to live.” But they give no heed to
what they read: “By the law there shall no flesh be justified in the
sight of God.” <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753) This may indeed
be possible before men, but not before Him who looks into our very heart
and inmost will, where He sees that, although the man who fears the law
keeps a certain precept, he would nevertheless rather do another thing
if he were permitted. And lest any one should suppose that, in the
passage just quoted from him, the apostle had meant to say that none are
justified by that law, which contains many precepts, under the figure of
the ancient sacraments, and among them that circumcision of the flesh
itself, which infants were commanded to receive on the eighth day after
birth; he immediately adds what law he meant, and says, “For by the law
is the knowledge of sin.” <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754) He
refers then to that law of which he afterwards declares, “I had not
known sin but by the law; for I had not known lust except the law had
said, Thou shalt not covet.” <span id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755) For
what means this but that “by the law comes the knowledge of sin?”
