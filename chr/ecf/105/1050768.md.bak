<span id="xvii.vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[VIII.\]—The Apostle Paul
Could Know the Third Heaven and Paradise, But Not Whether He Was in the
Body or Not.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xii-p2"></span>See therefore how many facts of our
nature, not of the past but of the present time, and not pertaining to
the body only, but also to our inner man, we know nothing about, without
deserving to be compared with the brute beasts. And yet this is the
opprobrious comparison which you have thought me worthy of, because I
have not complete knowledge of the past origin of my soul—although I am
not wholly ignorant of it, inasmuch as I know that it was given me by
God, and yet that it is not out of God. But when can I enumerate all the
particulars relating to the nature of our spirit and our soul of which
we are ignorant? Whereas we ought rather to utter that exclamation
before God, which the Psalmist uttered: “The knowledge of Thee is too
wonderful for me; it is very difficult, I cannot attain to it.” <span
id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464.md) Now why did he add the words *for
me*, except because he conjectured how incomprehensible was the
knowledge of God for himself, inasmuch as he was unable to comprehend
even his own self? The apostle was caught up into the third heaven, and
heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter; and
whether this had happened to him in the body or out of the body, he
declares himself unable to say; <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) but yet he has no fear of
encountering from you comparison with the cattle. His spirit knew that
it was in the third heaven, in paradise; but knew not whether it was in
the body. The third heaven, of course, and paradise were not the Apostle
Paul himself; but his body and soul and spirit were himself. Behold,
then, the curious fact: he knew the great things—lofty and divine—which
were not himself; but that which appertained to his own nature he was
ignorant of. Who in the vast knowledge of such occult things can help
being astonished at his great ignorance of his own existence? Who, in
short, would believe it possible, if one who errs not had not told us,
that “we know not what we should pray for as we ought”? <span
id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) Where, then, ought our bent and
purpose mainly to be—to “reach forth to those things which are before”?
And yet you compare me to cattle, if among the things which are behind I
have forgotten anything concerning my own origin—although you hear the
same apostle say: “Forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the
mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” <span
