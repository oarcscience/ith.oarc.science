<span id="xvii.iv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 \[IV.\]—The Errors Contained in
the Books of Vincentius Victor. He Says that the Soul Comes from God,
But Was Not Made Either Out of Nothing or Out of Any Created
Thing.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.iv-p2"></span>I will now proceed to point out what
things are chiefly to be avoided in his contentious statement. He says
that the soul was made, indeed, by God, but that it is not a portion of
God or of the nature of God,—which is an entirely true statement. When,
however, he refuses to allow that it is made out of nothing, and
mentions no other created thing out of which it was made; and makes God
its author, in such a sense that He must be supposed to have made it,
neither out of any non-existing things, that is, out of nothing, nor out
of anything which exists other than God, but out of His very self: he is
little aware that in the revolution of his thoughts he has come back to
the position which he thinks he has avoided, even that the soul is
nothing else than the nature of God; and consequently that there is an
actual something made out of the nature of God by the self-same God, for
the making of which the material of which He makes it is His own very
self who makes it; and that thus God’s nature is changeable, and by
being changed for the worse the very nature of God Himself incurs
condemnation at the hands of the self-same God! How far all this is from
being fit for your intelligent faith to suppose, how alien it is from
the heart of a catholic, and how much to be avoided, you can readily
see. For the soul is either so made out of the breath, or God’s breath
is so made into it, that it was not created out of Himself, but by
Himself out of nothing. It is not, indeed, like the case of a human
being, when he breathes: he <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="xvii.iv.iv-Page_317"></span>cannot form a breath out of nothing, but
he restores to the air the breath which he inhaled out of it. We may in
some such manner suppose that certain airs surrounded the Divine Being,
and that He inhaled a particle of it by breathing, and exhaled it again
by respiration, when He breathed into man’s face, and so formed for him
a soul. If this were the process, it could not have been out of His very
self, but out of the circumambient airy matter, that what He breathed
forth must have arisen. Far be it, however, from us to say, that the
Almighty could not have made the breath of life out of nothing, by which
man might become a living soul; and to crowd ourselves into such
straits, as that we must either think that something already existed
other than Himself, out of which He formed breath, or else suppose that
He formed out of Himself that which we see was made subject to change.
Now, whatever is out of Himself, must necessarily be of the self-same
nature as Himself, and therefore immutable: but the soul (as all allow)
is mutable. Therefore it is not out of Him, because it is not immutable,
as He is. If, however, it was not made of anything else, it was
undoubtedly made out of nothing—but by Himself.
