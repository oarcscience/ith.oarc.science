<span id="x.v.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—The Opinions of All
Controversialists Whatever are Not, However, Canonical Authority;
Original Sin, How Another’s; We Were All One Man in Adam.</span>

<span id="x.v.xiv-p2"></span>I have not quoted these words as if we
might rely upon the opinions of every disputant as on canonical
authority; but I have done it, that it may be seen how, from the
beginning down to the present age, which has given birth to this novel
opinion, the doctrine of original sin has been guarded with the utmost
constancy as a part of the Church’s faith, so that it is usually adduced
as most certain ground whereon to refute other opinions when false,
instead of being itself exposed to refutation by any one as false.
Moreover, in the sacred books of the canon, the authority of this
doctrine is vigorously asserted in the clearest and fullest way. The
apostle exclaims: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; and so it passed upon all men, in which all have sinned. <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687) Now from these words it cannot
certainly be said, that Adam’s sin has injured even those *who commit no
sin*, for the Scripture says, “*In which all have sinned.*” Nor, indeed,
are those sins of infancy so said to be *another’s*, as if they did not
belong to the infants at all, inasmuch as all then sinned in Adam, when
in his nature, by virtue of that innate power whereby he was able to
produce them, they were all as yet the one Adam; but they are called
*another’s*, <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688) because as yet they
were not living their own lives, but the life of the one man contained
whatsoever was in his future posterity.
