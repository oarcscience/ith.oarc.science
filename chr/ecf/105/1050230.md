<span id="xi.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 54.—Whether Faith Be in a Man’s Own
Power.</span>

<span id="xi.lvii-p2"></span>Attend now to the point which we have laid
down for discussion: whether faith is in our own power? We now speak of
that faith which we employ when we believe anything, not that which we
give when we make a promise; for this too is called *faith*. <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) We use the word in one sense when
we say, “He had no faith in me,” and in another sense when we say, “He
did not keep faith with me.” The one phrase means, “He did not believe
what I said;” the other, “He did not do what he promised.” According to
the faith by which we believe, we are faithful to God; but according to
that whereby a thing is brought to pass which is promised, God Himself
even is faithful to us; for the apostle declares, “God is faithful, who
will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.” <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md) Well, now, the former is the faith
about which we inquire, Whether it be in our power? even the faith by
which we believe God, or believe on God. For of this it is written,
“Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for
righteousness.” <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md) And again,
“To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is
counted for righteousness.” <span id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008.md)
Consider now whether anybody believes, if he be unwilling; or whether he
believes not, if he shall have willed it. Such a position, indeed, is
absurd (for what is believing but consenting to the truth of what is
said? and this consent is certainly voluntary): faith, therefore, is in
our own power. But, as the apostle says: “There is no power but comes
from God,” <span id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009.md) what reason then
is there why it may not be said to us even of this: “What hast thou
which thou hast not received?” <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md) —for it is God who gave us even to
believe. Nowhere, however, in Holy Scripture do we find such an
assertion as, There is no volition but comes from God. And rightly is it
not so written, because it is not true: otherwise God would be the
author even of sins (which Heaven forbid!), if there were no volition
except what comes from Him; inasmuch as an evil volition alone is
already a sin, even if the effect be wanting,—in other words, if it has
not ability. But when the evil volition receives ability to accomplish
its intention, this proceeds from the judgment of God, with whom there
is no unrighteousness. <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011.md) He
indeed punishes after this manner; nor is His chastisement unjust
because it is secret. The ungodly man, however, is not aware that he is
being punished, except when he unwillingly discovers by an open penalty
how much evil he has willingly committed. This is just what the apostle
says of certain men: “God hath given them up to the evil desires of
their own hearts, . . .to do those things that are not
convenient.” <span id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012.md) Accordingly, the
Lord also said to Pilate: “Thou couldest have no power at all against
me, except it were given thee from above.” <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013.md) But still, when the ability is
given, surely no necessity is imposed. Therefore, although David had
received ability to kill Saul, he preferred sparing to striking
him. <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014.md) Whence we understand
that bad men receive ability for the condemnation of their depraved
will, while good men receive ability for trying of their good will.
