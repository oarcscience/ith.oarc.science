<span id="xvi.v.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XXXIV.\]—By the Holiness of
Baptism, Not Sins Only, But All Evils Whatsoever, Have to Be Removed.
The Church is Not Yet Free from All Stain.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxix-p2"></span>And thus not only all the sins, but all
the ills of men of what kind soever, are in course of removal by the
holiness of that Christian laver whereby Christ cleanses His Church,
that He may present it to Himself, not in this world, but in that which
is to come, as not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. Now there
are some who maintain that such is the Church even now, and yet they are
in it. Well then, since they confess that they have some sins
themselves, if they say the truth in this (and, of course, they do, as
they are not free from sins), then the Church has “a spot” in them;
whilst if they tell an untruth in their confession (as speaking from a
double heart), then the Church has in them “a wrinkle.” If, however,
they assert that it is themselves, and not the Church, which has all
this, they then as good as acknowledge that they are not its members,
nor belong to its body, so that they are even condemned by their own
confession.
