<span id="xv.iv.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40 \[XXXV.\]—Marriage Existed Before
Sin Was Committed. How God’s Blessing Operated in Our First
Parents.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xl-p2"></span>There was, however, undoubtedly marriage,
even when sin had no prior existence; and for no other reason was it
that woman, and not a second man, was created as a help for the man.
Moreover, those words of God, “Be fruitful and multiply,” <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md) are not prophetic of sins to be
condemned, but a benediction upon the fertility of marriage. For by
these ineffable words of His, I mean by the divine methods which are
inherent in the truth of His wisdom by which all things were made, God
endowed the primeval pair with their seminal power. Suppose, however,
that nature had not been dishonoured by sin, God forbid that we should
think that marriages in Paradise must have been such, that in them the
procreative members would be excited by the mere ardour of lust, and not
by the command of the will for producing offspring,—as the foot is for
walking, the hand for labour, and the tongue for speech. Nor, as now
happens, would the chastity of virginity be corrupted to the conception
of offspring by the force of a turbid heat, but it would rather be
submissive to the power of the gentlest love; and thus there <span
id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span id="xv.iv.xl-Page_251"></span>would be
no pain, no blood-effusion of the concumbent virgin, as there would also
be no groan of the parturient mother. This, however, men refuse to
believe, because it has not been verified in the actual condition of our
mortal state. Nature, having been vitiated by sin, has never experienced
an instance of that primeval purity. But we speak to faithful men, who
have learnt to believe the inspired Scriptures, even though no examples
are adduced of actual reality. For how could I now possibly *prove* that
a man was made of the dust, without any parents, and a wife formed for
him out of his own side? <span id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) And
yet faith takes on trust what the eye no longer discovers.
