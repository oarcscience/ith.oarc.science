<span id="xviii.v.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—The New Testament is More
Ancient Than the Old; But It Was Subsequently Revealed.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.vii-p2"></span>Here, certainly, if we ask whether this
testament, which, he says, being confirmed by God was not weakened by
the law, which was made four hundred and thirty years after, is to be
understood as the new or the old one, who can hesitate to answer “the
new, but hidden in the prophetic shadows until the time should come
wherein it should be revealed in Christ”? For if we should say the old,
what will that be which genders from Mount Sinai to bondage? For there
was made the law four hundred and thirty years after, by which law he
asserts that this testament of the promise of Abraham could not be
weakened; and he will have this which was made by Abraham to pertain
rather to us, whom he will have to be children of the freewoman, not of
the bondwoman, heirs by the promise, not by the law, when he says, “For
if the inheritance be by the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave
it to Abraham by promise.” <span id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md) So
that, because the law was made four hundred and thirty years after, it
might enter that the offence might abound; <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) since by sin the pride of man
presuming on his own righteousness is convinced of transgression, and
where sin abounded grace much more abounded <span
id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md) by the faith of the now humble man
failing in the law and taking refuge in God’s mercy. Therefore, when he
had said, “For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no longer of
promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise,” <span
id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) as if it might be said to him, “Why
then was the law made afterwards? “he added and said, “What then is the
law?” <span id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md) To which interrogation
he immediately replied, “It was added because of transgression, until
the seed should come to which the promise was made.” <span
id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) This he says again, thus: “For if
they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is
made of none effect: because the law worketh wrath: for where there is
no law, there is no transgression.” <span
id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md) What he says in the former
testimony: “For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of
promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise,” this he says in the
latter: “For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void;
and the promise is made of none effect;” sufficiently showing that to
our faith (which certainly is of the new testament) belongs what God
gave to Abraham by promise. And what he says in the former testimony,
“What then is the law?” and answered, “It was added for the sake of
transgression,” this he instantly added in the latter testimony, “For
the law worketh wrath: for where there is no law, there is no
transgression.”
