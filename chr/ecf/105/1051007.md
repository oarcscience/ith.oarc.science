<span id="xx.xxvi-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Those Who are Called According to
the Purpose Alone are Predestinated.</span>

<span id="xx.xxvi-p2"></span>For this reason the apostle, when he had
said, “We know that to those who love God He work<span id="page_481">p.
481</span> <span id="xx.xxvi-Page_481"></span>eth all things together
for good,”—knowing that some love God, and do not continue in that good
way unto the end,—immediately added, “to them who are the called
according to His purpose.” <span id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md)
For these in their love for God continue even to the end; and they who
for a season wander from the way return, that they may continue unto the
end what they had begun to be in good. Showing, however, what it is to
be called according to His purpose, he presently added what I have
already quoted above, “Because whom He did before foreknow, He also
predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be
the first-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom He did predestinate,
them He also called,” to wit, according to His purpose; “and whom He
called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also
glorified.” <span id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md) All those things
are already done: He foreknew, He predestinated, He called, He
justified; because both all are already foreknown and predestinated, and
many are already called and justified; but that which he placed at the
end, “them He also glorified” (if, indeed, that glory is here to be
understood of which the same apostle says, “When Christ your life shall
appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory” <span
id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323) .md), this is not yet accomplished.
Although, also, those two things—that is, He called, and He
justified—have not been effected in all of whom they are said,—for
still, even until the end of the world, there remain many to be called
and justified,—nevertheless, He used verbs of the past tense, even
concerning things future, as if God had already arranged from eternity
that they should come to pass. For this reason, also, the prophet Isaiah
says concerning Him, “Who has made the things that shall be.” <span
id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324.md) Whosoever, therefore, in God’s most
providential ordering, are foreknown, predestinated, called, justified,
glorified,—I say not, even although not yet born again, but even
although not yet born at all, are already children of God, and
absolutely cannot perish. These truly come to Christ, because they come
in such wise as He Himself says, “All that the Father giveth me shall
come to me, and him that cometh to me I will not cast out;” <span
id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) and a little after He says, “This
is the will of the Father who hath sent me, that of all that He hath
given me I shall lose nothing.” <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md) From Him, therefore, is given also
perseverance in good even to the end; for it is not given save to those
who shall not perish, since they who do not persevere shall perish.
