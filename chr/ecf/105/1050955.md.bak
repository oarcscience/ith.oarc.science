<span id="xix.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[IX.\]—Eternal Life is “Grace
for Grace.”</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxi-p2"></span>Perhaps you ask whether we ever read in
the Sacred Scriptures of “*grace for grace*.” Well you possess the
Gospel according to John, which is perfectly clear in its very great
light. Here John the Baptist says of Christ: “Of His fulness have we all
received, even *grace for grace*.” <span
id="fr_3064"></span>[3065](#fn_3064.md) So that out of His fulness we have
received, according to our humble measure, our particles of ability as
it were for leading good lives—“according as God hath dealt to every man
his measure of faith;” <span id="fr_3065"></span>[3066](#fn_3065.md)
because “every man hath his proper gift of God; one after this manner,
and another after that.” <span id="fr_3066"></span>[3067](#fn_3066.md) And
this is grace. But, over and above this, we shall also receive “grace
for grace,” when we shall have awarded to us eternal life, of which the
apostle said: “The grace of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
Lord,” <span id="fr_3067"></span>[3068](#fn_3067.md) having just said that
“the wages of sin is death.” Deservedly did he call it “wages,” because
everlasting death is awarded as its proper due to diabolical service.
Now, when it was in his power to say, and rightly to say: “But the wages
of righteousness is eternal life,” he yet preferred to say: “The grace
of God is eternal life;” in order that we may hence understand that God
does not, for any merits of our own, but from His own divine compassion,
prolong our existence to everlasting life. Even as the Psalmist says to
his soul, “Who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.” <span
id="fr_3068"></span>[3069](#fn_3068.md) Well, now, is not a crown given as
the reward of good deeds? It is, however, only because He works good
works in good men, of whom it is said, “It is God which worketh in you
both to will and to do of His good pleasure,” <span
id="fr_3069"></span>[3070](#fn_3069.md) that the Psalm has it, as just now
quoted: “He crowneth thee with mercy and compassion,” since it is
through His mercy that we perform the good deeds to which the crown is
awarded. It is not, however, to be for a moment supposed, because he
said, “It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his own
good pleasure,” that free will is taken away. If this, indeed, had been
his meaning, he would not have said just before, “Work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling.” <span
id="fr_3070"></span>[3071](#fn_3070.md) For when the command is given “to
work,” their free will is addressed; and when it is added, “with fear
and trembling,” they are warned against boasting of their good deeds as
if they were their own, by attributing to themselves the performance of
anything good. It is pretty much as if the apostle had this question put
to him: “Why did you use the phrase, ‘with fear and trembling’?” And as
if he answered the inquiry of his examiners by telling them, “For it is
God which worketh in you.” Because if you fear and tremble, you do not
boast of your good works—as if they were your own, since it is God who
works within you.
