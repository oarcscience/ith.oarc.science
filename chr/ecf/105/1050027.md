id="x.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[IX.\]—Sin Passes on to All Men by
Natural Descent, and Not Merely by Imitation.</span>

<span id="x.iii.ix-p2"></span>You tell me in your letter, that they
endeavour to twist into some new sense the passage of the apostle, in
which he says: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin;” <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) yet you have not informed
me what they suppose to be the meaning of these words. But so far as I
have discovered from others, they think that the death which is here
mentioned is not the death of the body, which they will not allow Adam
to have deserved by his sin, but that of the soul, which takes place in
actual sin; and that this actual sin has not been transmitted from the
first man to other persons by natural descent, but by imitation. Hence,
likewise, they refuse to believe that in infants original sin is
remitted through baptism, for they contend that no such original sin
exists at all in people by their birth. But if the apostle had wished to
assert that sin entered into the world, not by natural descent, but by
imitation, he would have mentioned as the first offender, not Adam
indeed, but the devil, of whom it is written, <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) that “he sinneth from the beginning;”
of whom also we read in the Book of Wisdom: “Nevertheless through the
devil’s envy death entered into the world.” <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) Now, forasmuch as this death came upon
men from the devil, not because they were propagated by him, but because
they imitated his example, it is immediately added: “And they that do
hold of his side do imitate him.” <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) Accordingly, the apostle, when
mentioning sin and death together, which had passed by natural descent
from one upon all men, set him down as the introducer thereof from whom
the propagation of the human race took its beginning.
