<span id="xiii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—(32.) The Fourth Passage. In
What Sense God Only is Good. With God to Be Good and to Be Himself are
the Same Thing.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxxvi-p2"></span>“They likewise,” says he, “quote what
the Saviour says: ‘Why callest thou me good? There is none good save
one, that is, God?’” <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) This
statement, however, he makes no attempt whatever to explain; all he does
is to oppose to it sundry other passages which seem to contradict it,
which he adduces to show that man, too, is good. Here are his remarks:
“We must answer this text with another, in which the same Lord says, ‘A
good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good
things.’ <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) And again: ‘He
maketh His sun to rise on the good and on the evil.’ <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) Then in another passage it is
written, ‘For the good things are created from the beginning;’ <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) and yet again, ‘They that are good
shall dwell in the land.’” <span id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md)
Now to all this we must say in answer, that the passages in question
must be understood in the same sense as the former one, “There is none
good, save one, that is, God.” Either because all created things,
although God made them very <span id="page_171">p. 171</span> <span
id="xiii.xxxvi-Page_171"></span>good, are yet, when compared with their
Creator, not good, being in fact incapable of any comparison with Him.
For in a transcendent, and yet very proper sense, He said of Himself,
“<span class="c16"><span id="xiii.xxxvi-p7.2"></span>I Am that I
Am.</span>” <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) The statement
therefore before us, “None is good save one, that is, God,” is used in
some such way as that which is said of John, “He was not that
light;” <span id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) although the Lord
calls him “a lamp,” <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) just as
He says to His disciples: “Ye are the light of the world: . . .neither
do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel.” <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) Still, in comparison with that
light which is “the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world,” <span id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) he was not light.
Or else, because the very sons of God even, when compared with
themselves as they shall hereafter become in their eternal perfection,
are good in such a way that they still remain also evil. Although I
should not have dared to say this of them (for who would be so bold as
to call them evil who have God for their Father?) unless the Lord had
Himself said: “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to
your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give
good things to them that ask Him?” <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) Of course, by applying to them the
words, “your Father,” He proved that they were already sons of God; and
yet at the same time He did not hesitate to say that they were “evil.”
Your author, however, does not explain to us how they are good, whilst
yet “there is none good save one, that is, God.” Accordingly the man who
asked “what good thing he was to do,” <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) was admonished to seek Him <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) by whose grace he might be good; to
whom also *to be good* is nothing else than *to be Himself*, because He
is unchangeably good, and cannot be evil at all.
