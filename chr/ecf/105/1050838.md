<span id="xviii.iii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XXI.\]—Julian’s Fifth
Objection Concerning the Saints of the Old Testament.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxxix-p2"></span>“We say,” says he, “that the saints
of the Old Testament, their righteousness being perfected here, passed
to eternal life,—that is, that by the love of virtue they departed from
all sins; because those whom we read of as having committed any sin, we
nevertheless know to have amended themselves.” Of whatever virtue you
may declare that the ancient righteous men were possessed, nothing saved
them but the belief in the Mediator who shed His blood for the remission
of their sins. For their own word is, “I believed, and therefore I
spoke.” <span id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md) Whence the Apostle
Paul also says, “And we having the same Spirit of faith, according as it
is written, I believed, <span id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span
id="xviii.iii.xxxix-Page_390"></span>and therefore have I spoken; we
also believe, and therefore speak.” <span
id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) What is “the same Spirit,” but that
Spirit whom these righteous men also had who said such things? The
Apostle Peter also says, “Why do ye wish to put a yoke upon the heathen,
which neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? But, by the
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe that we shall be saved, even
as they.” <span id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615.md) You who are enemies
to this grace do not wish this, that the ancients should be believed to
have been saved by the same grace of Jesus Christ; but you distribute
the times according to Pelagius, <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616.md) in whose books this is read, and
you say that before the law men were saved by nature, then by the law,
lastly by Christ, as if to men of the two former times, that is to say,
before the law and under the law, the blood of Christ had not been
necessary; making void what is said: “For there is one God and one
Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” <span
