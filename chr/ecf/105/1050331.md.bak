<span id="xii.lxxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 84 \[LXX.\]—The Degrees of Love
are Also Degrees of Holiness.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxxviii-p2"></span>Inchoate love, therefore, is inchoate
holiness; advanced love is advanced holiness; great love is great
holiness; “perfect love is perfect holiness,”—but this “love is out of a
pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,” <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md) “which in this life is then the
greatest, when life itself is contemned in comparison with it.” <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) I wonder, however, whether it has
not a soil in which to grow after it has quitted this mortal life! But
in what place and at what time soever it shall reach that state of
absolute perfection, which shall admit of no increase, it is certainly
not “shed abroad in our hearts” by any energies either of the nature or
the volition that are within us, but “by the Holy Ghost which is given
unto us,” <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md) “and which both
helps our infirmity and co-operates with our strength. For it is itself
indeed the grace of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom, with
the Father and the Holy Spirit, appertaineth eternity, and all goodness,
for ever and ever. Amen.
