id="xvii.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15 \[XI.\]—His Ninth Error. (See
Above in Book II. 14 \[X.\].)</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.xv-p2"></span>If you wish to be a catholic, I pray
you, neither believe, nor say, nor teach that “there are some mansions
outside the kingdom of God which the Lord said were in His Father’s
house.” For He does not affirm, as you have adduced his testimony,
“There are with my Father (*apud Patrem meum*) many mansions;” although,
if He had even expressed Himself so, the mansions could hardly be
supposed to have any other situation than *in the house* of His Father;
but He plainly says, “In my Father’s house are many mansions.” <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448) Now, who would be so reckless as to
separate some parts of God’s house from the kingdom of God; so that,
whilst the kings of the earth are found reigning, not in their house
only, nor only in their own country, but far and wide, even in regions
across the sea, the King who made the heaven and the earth is not
described as reigning even over all His own house?
