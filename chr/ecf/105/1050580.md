<span id="xvi.v.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—The Teaching of the Apostle on
This Subject.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xv-p2"></span>Accordingly the apostle also, speaking
apparently with this passage in view, declares: “But this I say,
brethren, the time is short: it re<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>
<span id="xvi.v.xv-Page_270"></span>maineth, that both they that have
wives be as though they had them not; and they that weep, as though they
wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they
that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world, as
though they used it not: for the fashion of this world passeth away. But
I would have you without solicitude.” <span
id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110.md) This entire passage (that I may
express my view on this subject in the shape of a brief exposition of
the apostle’s words) I think must be understood as follows: “This I say,
brethren, the time is short.” No longer is God’s people to be propagated
by carnal generation; but, henceforth, it is to be gathered out by
spiritual regeneration. “It remaineth, therefore, that they that have
wives” be not subject to carnal concupiscence; “and they that weep,”
under the sadness of present evil, should rejoice in the hope of future
blessing; “and they that rejoice,” over any temporary advantage, should
fear the eternal judgment; “and they that buy,” should so hold their
possessions as not to cleave to them by overmuch love; “and they that
use this world” should reflect that it is passing away, and does not
remain. “For the fashion of this world passeth away: but,” he says, “I
would have you to be without solicitude,”—in other words: I would have
you lift up your heart, that it may dwell among those things which do
not pass away. He then goes on to say: “He that is unmarried careth for
the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he
that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may
please his wife.” <span id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111.md) And thus to
some extent he explains what he had already said: “Let them that have
wives be as though they had none.” For they who have wives in such a way
as to care for the things of the Lord, how they may please the Lord,
without having any care for the things of the world in order to please
their wives, are, in fact, just as if they had no wives. And this is
effected with greater ease when the wives, too, are of such a
disposition, because they please their husbands not merely because they
are rich, because they are high in rank, noble in race, and amiable in
natural temper, but because they are believers, because they are
religious, because they are chaste, because they are good men.
