Calumny,—That Augustin Asserts that Even Christ Was Not Free from
Sins.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxv-p2"></span>In like manner as to what he added,
that I say, <span id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588.md) “that Christ even
was not free from sins, but that, from the necessity of the flesh, He
spoke falsely, and was stained with other faults,” he should see from
whom he heard these things, or in whose letters he read them; for that,
indeed, he perchance did not understand them, and turned them by the
deceitfulness of malice into calumnious meanings.
