<span id="xx.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10—All Perseverance is God’s
Gift.</span>

<span id="xx.xiii-p2"></span>Is such an one as is unwilling to be
rebuked still able to say, “What have I done,—I who have not received?”
when it appears plainly that he has received, and by his own fault has
lost that which he has received? “I am able,” says he, “I am altogether
able,—when you reprove me for having of my own will relapsed from a good
life into a bad one,—still to say, What have I done,—I who have not
received? For I have received faith, which worketh by love, but I have
not received perseverance therein to the end. Will any one dare to say
that this perseverance is not the gift of God, and that so great a
possession as this is ours in such wise that if any one have it the
apostle could not say to him, ‘For what hast thou which thou hast not
received?’ <span id="fr_3269"></span>[3270](#fn_3269) since he has this
in such a manner as that he has not received it?” To this, indeed, we
are not able to deny, that perseverance in good, progressing even to the
end, is also a great gift of God; and that it exists not save it come
from Him of whom it is written, “Every best gift and every perfect gift
is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.” <span
id="fr_3270"></span>[3271](#fn_3270) But the rebuke of him who has not
persevered must not on that account be neglected, “lest God perchance
give unto him repentance, and he recover from the snares of the
devil;” <span id="fr_3271"></span>[3272](#fn_3271) since to the
usefulness of rebuke the apostle has subjoined this decision, saying, as
I have above mentioned, “Rebuking with moderation those that think
differently, lest at any time God give them repentance.” <span
id="fr_3272"></span>[3273](#fn_3272) For if we should say that such a
perseverance, so laudable and so blessed, is man’s in such wise as that
he has it not from God, we first of all make void that which the Lord
says to Peter: “I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.” <span
id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273) For what did He ask for him, but
perseverance to the end? And assuredly, if a man could have this from
man, it should not have been asked from God. Then when the apostle says,
“Now we pray to God that ye do no evil,” <span
id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274) beyond a doubt he prays to God on
their behalf for perseverance. For certainly he does not “do no evil”
who forsakes good, and, not persevering in good, turns to the evil, from
which he ought to turn aside. <span id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275)
In that place, moreover, where he says, “I thank my God in every
remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making
quest with joy for your fellowship <span
id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276) in the gospel from the first day
until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a
good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,” <span
id="fr_3277"></span>[3278](#fn_3277) —what else does he promise to them
from the mercy of God than perseverance in good to the end? And again
where he says, “Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant of
Christ Jesus, always striving for you in prayer, that you may stand
perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God,” <span
id="fr_3278"></span>[3279](#fn_3278) —what is “that you may stand” but
“that you may persevere”? Whence it was said of the devil, “He stood not
in the truth;” <span id="fr_3279"></span>[3280](#fn_3279) because he was
there, but he did not continue. For assuredly those were already
standing in the faith. And when we pray that he who stands may stand, we
do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere. Jude the
apostle, again, when he says, “Now unto Him that is able to keep you
without offence, and to establish you before the presence of His glory,
immaculate in joy,” <span id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280) does he
not most manifestly show that perseverance in good unto the end is God’s
gift? For what but a good perseverance does He give who preserves
without offence that He may place before the presence of His glory
immaculate in joy? What <span id="page_476">p. 476</span> <span
id="xx.xiii-Page_476"></span>is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts
of the Apostles: “And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and
received the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal
life believed”?  <span id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281) Who could be
ordained to eternal life save by the gift of perseverance? And when we
read, “He that shall persevere unto the end shall be saved;” <span
id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282) with what salvation but eternal?
And when, in the Lord’s Prayer, we say to God the Father, “Hallowed be
Thy name,” <span id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283) what do we ask but
that His name may be hallowed in us? And as this is already accomplished
by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily asked by
believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in
us? For the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner,
inasmuch as, in his exposition of the same prayer, he says: “We say,
‘Hallowed be Thy name,’ not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed
by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed in
us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows? Well, because
He said, ‘Be ye holy, since I also am holy;’ <span
id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284) we ask and entreat that we who have
been hallowed in baptism may persevere in that which we have begun to
be.” <span id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285) Behold the most glorious
martyr is of this opinion, that what in these words Christ’s faithful
people are daily asking is, that they may persevere in that which they
have begun to be. And no one need doubt, but that whosoever prays from
the Lord that he may persevere in good, confesses thereby that such
perseverance is His gift.
