id="x.iv.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 55.—To Recover the Righteousness Which
Had Been Lost by Sin, Man Has to Struggle, with Abundant Labour and
Sorrow.</span>

<span id="x.iv.lv-p2"></span>The flesh which was originally created was
not that sinful flesh in which man refused to maintain his righteousness
amidst the delights of Paradise, wherefore God determined that sinful
flesh should propagate itself after it had sinned, and struggle for the
recovery of holiness, in many toils and troubles. Therefore, after Adam
was driven out of Paradise, he had to dwell over against Eden,—that is,
over against the garden of delights,—to indicate that it is by labours
and sorrows, which are the very contraries of delights, that sinful
flesh had to be educated, after it had failed amidst its first pleasures
to maintain its holiness, previous to its becoming sinful flesh. As
therefore our first parents, by their subsequent return to righteous
living, by which they are supposed to have been released from the worst
penalty of their sentence through the blood of the Lord, were still not
deemed worthy to be recalled to Paradise during their life on earth, so
in like manner our sinful flesh, even if a man lead a righteous life in
it after the remission of his sins, does not deserve to be immediately
exempted from that death which it has derived from its propagation of
sin. <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md)
