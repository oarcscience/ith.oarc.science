<span id="xi.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[XII\]—The Knowledge of God Through
the Creation.</span>

<span id="xi.xxii-p2"></span>And then the apostle very properly turns
from this point to describe with detestation those men who, light-minded
and puffed up by the sin which I have mentioned in the preceding
chapter, have been carried away of their own conceit, as it were,
through empty space where they could find no resting-place, only to fall
shattered to pieces against the vain figments of their idols, as against
stones. For, after he had commended the piety of that faith, whereby,
being justified, we must needs be pleasing to God, he proceeds to call
our attention to what we ought to abominate as the opposite. “For the
wrath of God,” says he, “is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
and unrighteousness of men, who hold down the truth in unrighteousness;
because that which may be known of God is manifest in them: for God hath
showed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him are clearly seen
from the creation of the world, being understood through the things that
are made, even His eternal power and divinity; so that they are without
excuse: because, knowing God, they yet glorified Him not as God, neither
were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools;
and they changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made
like to corruptible man, and to birds, and to four footed beasts, and to
creeping things.” <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) Observe, he
does not say that they were ignorant of the truth, but that they held
down the truth in unrighteousness. For it occurred to him, that he would
inquire whence the knowledge of the truth could be obtained by those to
whom God had not given the law; and he was not silent on the source
whence they could have obtained it: for he declares that it was through
the visible works of creation that they arrived at the knowledge of the
invisible attributes of the Creator. And, in very deed, as they
continued to possess great faculties for searching, so they were able to
find. Wherein then lay their impiety? Because “when they knew God, they
glorified Him not as God, nor gave Him thanks, but became vain in their
imaginations.” Vanity is a disease especially of those who mislead
themselves, and “think themselves to be something, when they are
nothing.” <span id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) Such men, indeed,
darken themselves in that swelling pride, the foot of which the holy
singer prays that it may not come against him, <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) after saying, “In Thy light shall we
see light;” <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md) from which very
light of unchanging truth they turn aside, and “their foolish heart is
darkened.” <span id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md) For theirs was not a
wise heart, even though they knew God; but it was foolish rather,
because they did not glorify Him as God, or give Him thanks; for “He
said unto man, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.” <span
id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) So by this conduct, while “professing
themselves to be wise” (which can only be understood to mean that they
attributed this to themselves), “they became fools.” <span
