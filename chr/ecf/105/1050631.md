<span id="xvi.vi.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24 \[XI.\]—What Covenant of God the
New-Born Babe Breaks. What Was the Value of Circumcision.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxv-p2"></span>But let him inform us how it was that
his <span id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245) soul would be cut off
from his people if he had not been circumcised on the eighth day. How
could he have so sinned, how so offended God, as to be punished for the
neglect of others towards him with so severe a sentence, had there been
no original sin in the case? For thus ran the commandment of God
concerning the circumcision of infants: “The uncircumcised man-child,
whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised on the eighth day, his
soul shall be cut off from his people; because he hath broken my
covenant.” <span id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246) Let him tell us,
if he can, how that child broke God’s covenant,—an innocent babe, so far
as he was personally concerned, of eight days’ age; and yet there is by
no means any falsehood uttered here by God or Holy Scripture. The fact
is, the covenant of God which he then broke was not this which commanded
circumcision, but that which forbade the tree; when “by one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all
men, for in him all have sinned.”  <span
id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247) And in his case the expiation of
this was signified by the circumcision of the eighth day, that is, by
the sacrament of the Mediator who was to be incarnate. For it was
through this same faith in Christ, who was to come in the flesh, and was
to die for us, and on the third day (which coming after the seventh or
Sabbath day, was to be the eighth) to rise again, that even holy men
were saved of old. For “He was delivered for our offences, and raised
again for our justification.” <span id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248)
Ever since circumcision was instituted amongst the people of God, which
was at that time the sign of the righteousness of faith, it availed also
to signify the cleansing even in infants of the original and primitive
sin, just as baptism in like manner from the time of its institution
began to be of avail for the renewal of man. Not that there was no
justification by faith before circumcision; for even when he was still
in uncircumcision, Abraham was himself justified by faith, being the
father of those nations which should also imitate his faith. <span
id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249) In former times, however, the
sacramental mystery of justification by faith lay concealed in every
mode. Still it was the self-same faith in the Mediator which saved the
saints of old, both small and great—not the old covenant, “which
gendereth to bondage;” <span id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250) not
the law, which was not so given as to be able to give life; <span
id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251) but the grace of God through Jesus
Christ our Lord. <span id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252) For as we
believe that Christ has come in the flesh, so they believed that He was
to come; as, again, we believe that He has died, so they believed that
He would die; and as we believe that He has risen from the dead, so they
believed that He would rise again; whilst both we and they believe
alike, that He will hereafter come to judge the quick and the dead. Let
not this man, then, throw any hindrance in the way of its salvation upon
human nature, by setting up a bad defence of its merits; because we are
all born under sin, and are delivered therefrom by the only One who was
born without sin.
