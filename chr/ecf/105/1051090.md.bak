<span id="xxi.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8 \[V.\]—The Fifth Petition. It is an
Error of the Pelagians that the Righteous are Free from Sin.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.x-p2"></span>In the fifth sentence of the prayer we
say, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors,” <span
id="fr_3571"></span>[3572](#fn_3571.md) in which petition alone
perseverance is not found to be asked for. For the sins which we ask to
be forgiven us are past, but perseverance, which saves us for eternity,
is indeed necessary for the time of this life; but not for the time
which is past, but for that which remains even to its end. Yet it is
worth the labour to consider for a little, how even already in this
petition the heretics who were to arise long after were transfixed by
the tongue of Cyprian, as if by the most invincible dart of truth. For
the Pelagians dare to say even this: that the right<span
id="page_529">p. 529</span> <span id="xxi.iii.x-Page_529"></span>eous
man in this life has no sin at all, and that in such men there is even
at the present time a Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such
thing, <span id="fr_3572"></span>[3573](#fn_3572.md) which is the one and
only bride of Christ; as if she were not His bride who throughout the
whole earth says what she has learnt from Him, “Forgive us our debts.”
But observe how the most glorious Cyprian destroys these. For when he
was expounding that very clause of the Lord’s Prayer, he says among
other things: “And how necessarily, how providently, and salutarily are
we admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for
our sins; and while pardon is asked for from God, the soul recalls its
own consciousness. Lest any one should flatter himself that he is
innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is
instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden daily to
entreat for his sins. Thus, moreover, John also in his Epistle
warns <span id="fr_3573"></span>[3574](#fn_3573.md) us, and says, <span
id="fr_3574"></span>[3575](#fn_3574.md) ‘If we say that we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.’” <span
id="fr_3575"></span>[3576](#fn_3575.md) And the rest, which it would be
long to insert in this place.
