<span id="xvii.v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[XIV.\]—Victor Relies on
Ambiguous Scriptures.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.xix-p2"></span>The passages of Scripture, indeed, which
he has adduced in the attempt to prove from them that God did not derive
human souls by propagation from the primitive soul, but as in that first
instance that He formed them by breathing them into each individual, are
so uncertain and ambiguous, that they can with the utmost facility be
taken in a different sense from that which he would assign to them. This
point I have already demonstrated <span
id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) with sufficient clearness, I think
in the book which I addressed to that friend o ours, of whom I have made
mention above. The passages which he has used for his proofs inform us
that God gives, or makes, or fashion men’s souls; but whence He gives
them, or of what He makes or fashions them, they tell us nothing: they
leave untouched the question whether it be by propagation from the first
soul or by insufflation, like the first soul. This writer however,
simply because he reads that God “giveth” souls, <span
id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) “hath made” souls, “formeth” souls,
supposes that these phrases amount to a denial of the propagation of
souls; whereas, by the testimony of the same scripture, God *gives* men
their bodies, or *makes* them, or *fashions* and *forms* them; although
no one doubts that the said bodies are given, made, and formed by Him by
seminal propagation.
