id="xviii.iii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41 \[XXIII.\]—The Seventh
Objection, of the Effect of Baptism.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xli-p2"></span>“We condemn,” says he, “those who
affirm that baptism does not do away all sins, because we know that full
cleansing is conferred by these mysteries.” We also say this; but you do
not say that infants are also by those same mysteries freed from the
bonds of their first birth and of their hateful descent. On which
account it behoves you, like other heretics also, to be separated from
the Church of Christ, which holds this of old time.
