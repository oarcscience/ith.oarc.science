<span id="xv.iv.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47 \[XLI.\]—Sentences from Ambrose
in Favour of Original Sin.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xlvii-p2"></span>And now that we are about to bring this
book to a conclusion, we think it proper to do on this subject of
*Original Sin* what we did before in our treatise *On Grace*, <span
id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) —adduce in evidence against the
injurious talk of these persons that servant of God, the Archbishop
Ambrose, whose faith is proclaimed by Pelagius to be the most perfect
among the writers of the Latin Church; for *grace* is more especially
honoured in doing away with *original sin*. In the work which the
saintly Ambrose wrote, *Concerning the Resurrection,* he says: “I fell
in Adam, in Adam was I expelled from Paradise, in Adam I died; and He
does not recall me unless He has found me in Adam,—so as that, as I am
obnoxious to the guilt of sin in him, and subject to death, I may be
also justified in Christ.” <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md)
Then, again, writing against the Novatians, he says: “We men are all of
us born in sin; our very origin is in sin; as you may read when David
says, ‘Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother
conceive me.’ <span id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) Hence it is
that Paul’s flesh is ‘a body of death;’ <span
id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) even as he says himself, ‘Who shall
deliver me from the body of this death?’ Christ’s flesh, however, has
con<span id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span
id="xv.iv.xlvii-Page_254"></span>demned sin, which He experienced not by
being born, and which by dying He crucified, that in our flesh there
might be justification through grace, where previously there was
impurity through sin.” <span id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) The
same holy man also, in his *Exposition of Isaiah*, speaking of Christ,
says: “Therefore as man He was tried in all things, and in the likeness
of men He endured all things; but as born of the Spirit, He was free
from sin. For every man is a liar, and no one but God alone is without
sin. It is therefore an observed and settled fact, that no man born of a
man and a woman, that is, by means of their bodily union, is seen to be
free from sin. Whosoever, indeed, is free from sin, is free also from a
conception and birth of this kind.” <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) Moreover, when expounding the
Gospel according to Luke, he says: “It was no cohabitation with a
husband which opened the secrets of the Virgin’s womb; rather was it the
Holy Ghost which infused immaculate seed into her unviolated womb. For
the Lord Jesus alone of those who are born of woman is holy, inasmuch as
He experienced not the contact of earthly corruption, by reason of the
novelty of His immaculate birth; nay, He repelled it by His heavenly
majesty.”  <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md)
