<span id="xvii.vii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36 \[XXII.\]—He Passes on to the
Second Question About the Soul, Whether It is Called Spirit.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxxvi-p2"></span>It now remains for me to show how it
is that while the designation *spirit* is rightly predicated of a part
of the soul, not the whole of it,—even as the apostle says, “Your whole
spirit, and soul, and body;” <span id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506.md)
or, according to the much more expressive statement in the Book of Job,
“Thou wilt separate my soul from my spirit,” <span
id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507.md) —yet the whole soul is also called
by this name; although this question seems to be much more a question of
names than of things. For since it is certainly a fact that there is a
something in the soul which is properly called “spirit,” while (this
being left out of question) it is also designated with equal propriety
“soul,” our present contention is not about the things themselves; <span
id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508.md) mainly because I on my side
certainly admit, and you on your part say the same, that that is
properly called spirit by which we reason and understand, and yet that
these things are distinguishingly designated, as the apostle says “your
whole spirit, and soul, and body.” This spirit, however, the same
apostle appears also to describe as *mind*; as when he says, “So then
with the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of
sin.”  <span id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509.md) Now the meaning of
this is precisely what he expresses in another passage thus: “For the
flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh.” <span id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510.md) What he designates
*mind* in the former place, he must be understood to call *spirit* in
the latter passage. Not as you interpret the statement, “The whole mind
is meant, which consists of soul and spirit,”—a view which I know not
where you obtained. By our “mind,” indeed, we usually understand nothing
but our rational and intellectual faculty; and thus, when the apostle
says, “Be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind,” <span
id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511.md) what else does he mean than, Be ye
renewed in your mind? “The spirit of the mind” is, accordingly, nothing
else than the mind, just as “the body of the flesh” is nothing but the
flesh; thus it is written, “In putting off the body of the flesh,” <span
id="fr_2512"></span>[2513](#fn_2512.md) where the apostle calls the flesh
“the body of the flesh.” He designates it, indeed, in another point of
view as the spirit of man, which he quite distinguishes from the mind:
“If,” says he, “I pray with the tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my mind
is unfruitful.” <span id="fr_2513"></span>[2514](#fn_2513.md) We are not
now, however, speaking of that spirit which is distinct from the mind;
and this involves a question relating to itself which is really a
difficult one. For in many ways and in divers senses the Holy Scriptures
make mention of the spirit; but with respect to that we are now speaking
of, by which we exercise reason, intelligence, and wisdom, we are both
agreed that it is called (and indeed rightly called) “spirit,” in such a
sense as not to include the entire soul, but a part of it. If, however,
you contend that the soul is not the spirit, on the ground that the
understanding is distinctly called “spirit,” you may as well deny that
the whole seed of Jacob is called Israel, since, apart from Judah, the
same appellation was distinctly and separately borne by the ten tribes
which were then organized in Samaria. But why need we linger any longer
here on this subject?

soul and spirit constituted a single substantial unity, and this one
spiritual essence was “soul” (*anima*) so far as it was the informing
and vivifying principle of the body, and “spirit” (*spiritus*) so far as
it was the power of rational thought.—W.\]
