<span id="xxi.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—When Perseverance is Granted to a
Person, He Cannot But Persevere.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xi-p2"></span>Now, moreover, when the saints say,
“Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,” <span
id="fr_3576"></span>[3577](#fn_3576) what do they pray for but that they
may persevere in holiness? For, assuredly, when that gift of God is
granted to them,—which is sufficiently plainly shown to be God’s gift,
since it is asked of Him,—that gift of God, then, being granted to them
that they may not be led into temptation, none of the saints fails to
keep his perseverance in holiness even to the end. For there is not any
one who ceases to persevere in the Christian purpose unless he is first
of all led into temptation. If, therefore, it be granted to him
according to his prayer that he may not be led, certainly by the gift of
God he persists in that sanctification which by the gift of God he has
received.
