<span id="xiii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—(31.) The Third Passage. It is
One Thing to Depart, and Another Thing to Have Departed, from All Sin.
“There is None that Doeth Good,”—Of Whom This is to Be
Understood.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxxv-p2"></span>He has likewise propounded another
question, as we shall proceed to show, but has failed to solve it; nay,
he has rather rendered it more difficult, by first stating the testimony
that had been quoted against him: “There is none that doeth good, no,
not one;” <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497) and then resorting
to seemingly contrary passages to show that there are persons who do
good. This he succeeded, no doubt, in doing. It is, however, one thing
for a man not to do good, and another thing not to be without sin,
although he at the same time may do many good things. The passages,
therefore, which he adduces are not really contrary to the statement
that no person is without sin in this life. He does not, for his own
part, explain in what sense it is declared that “there is none that
doeth good, no, not one.” These are his words: “Holy David indeed says,
‘Hope thou in the Lord and be doing good.’” <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498) But this is a precept, and not an
accomplished fact; and such a precept as is never kept by those of whom
it is said, “There is none that doeth good, no, not one.” He adds: “Holy
Tobit also said, ‘Fear not, my son, that we have to endure poverty; we
shall have many blessings if we fear God, and depart from all sin, and
do that which is good.’” <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499) Most
true indeed it is, that man shall have many blessings when he shall have
departed from all sin. Then no evil shall betide him; nor shall he have
need of the prayer, “Deliver us from evil.” <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500) Although even now every man who
progresses, advancing ever with an upright purpose, departs from all
sin, and becomes further removed from it as he approaches nearer to the
fulness and perfection of the righteous state; because even
concupiscence itself, which is sin dwelling in our flesh, never ceases
to diminish in those who are making progress, although it still remains
in their mortal members. It is one thing, therefore, to depart from all
sin,—a process which is even now in operation,—and another thing to have
departed from all sin, which shall happen in the state of future
perfection. But still, even he who has departed already from evil, and
is continuing to do so, must be allowed to be a doer of good. How then
is it said, in the passage which he has quoted and left unsolved, “There
is none that doeth good, no, not one,” unless that the Psalmist there
censures some one nation, amongst whom there was not a man that did
good, wishing to remain “children of men,” and not sons of God, by whose
grace man becomes good, in order to do good? For we must suppose the
Psalmist here to mean that “good” which he describes in the context,
saying, “God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
there were any that did understand, and seek God.” <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501) Such good then as this, seeking
after God, there was not a man found who pursued it, no, not one; but
this was in that class of men which is predestinated to
destruction. <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502) It was upon such
that God looked down in His foreknowledge, and passed sentence.

<span id="xiii.xxxv-p8"></span> On this passage Fulgentius remarks (*Ad
Monimum*, i. 5): “In no other sense do I suppose that passage of St.
Augustin should be taken, in which he affirms that there are certain
persons predestinated to destruction than in regard to their punishment,
not their sin: not to the evil which they unrighteously commit, but to
the punishment which they shall righteously suffer; not to the sin on
account of which they either do not receive, or else lose, the benefit
of the first resurrection, but to the retribution which their own
personal iniquity evilly incurs, and the divine justice righteously
inflicts.”
