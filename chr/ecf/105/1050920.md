<span id="xviii.vi.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27 \[X.\]—Cyprian’s Testimonies
Concerning the Imperfection of Our Own Righteousness.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxvii-p2"></span>Let us, then, see that third point,
which in these men is not less shocking to every member of Christ and to
His whole body,—that they contend that there are in this life, or that
there have been, righteous men having absolutely no sin. <span
id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862.md) In which presumption they most
manifestly contradict the Lord’s Prayer, wherein, with truthful heart
and with daily words, all the members of Christ cry aloud, “Forgive us
our debts.” Let us see, then, what Cyprian, most glorious in the Lord,
thought of this,—what he not only said for the instruction of the
Churches, not, of course, of the Manicheans, but of the catholics, but
also committed to letters and to memory. In the epistle on “Works and
Alms,” he says: “Let us then acknowledge, beloved brethren, the
wholesome gift of the divine mercy, and let us who cannot be without
some wound of conscience heal our wounds by the spiritual remedies for
the cleansing and purging of our sins. Nor let any one so flatter
himself with the notion of a pure and immaculate heart, as, in
dependence on his own innocence, to think that the medicine needs not to
be applied to his wounds; since it is written, ‘Who shall boast that he
hath a clean heart, or who shall boast that he is pure from sins?’ <span
id="fr_2863"></span>[2864](#fn_2863.md) And again, in his epistle, John
lays it down and says, ‘If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us.’ <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864.md) But if no one can be without sin,
and whoever should say that he is without fault is either proud or
foolish, how needful, how kind is the divine mercy, which, knowing that
there are still found some wounds in those that have been healed, has
given even after their healing wholesome remedies for the curing and
healing of their wounds anew!” <span
id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865.md) Again, in the same treatise he
says: “And since there cannot fail daily to be sins committed in the
sight of God, there failed not daily sacrifices wherewith the sins might
be cleansed away.” <span id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866.md) Also, in
the treatise on the Mortality, he says: “Our warfare is with avarice,
with immodesty, with anger, with ambition; our trying and toilsome
wrestling with carnal vices, with the enticements of the world. The mind
of man besieged, and on every hand invested with the onsets of the
devil, scarcely meets the repeated attacks, scarcely resists them. If
avarice is prostrated, lust springs up. If lust is overcome, ambition
takes its place. If ambition is despised, anger exasperates, pride puffs
up, wine-bibbing entices; envy breaks concord; jealousy cuts friendship;
you are constrained to curse, which the divine law forbids; you are
compelled to swear, which is not lawful. So many persecutions the soul
suffers daily, with so many risks is the heart wearied; and yet it
delights to abide here long among the devil’s weapons, although it
should rather be our craving and wish to hasten to Christ by the aid of
a quicker death.” <span id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867.md) Again, in
the same treatise he says: “The blessed Apostle Paul in his epistle lays
it down, saying, ‘To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain;’ <span
id="fr_2868"></span>[2869](#fn_2868.md) counting it the greatest gain no
longer to be held by the snares of this world, no longer to be liable to
the sins and vices of the flesh.” <span
id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869.md) Moreover, on the Lord’s Prayer,
explaining what it is we ask when we say, “Hallowed be thy name,” he
says, among other matters: “For we have need of daily sanctification,
that we, who daily fall away, may wash out our sins by continual
sanctification.” <span id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870.md) Again, in
the same treatise, when he would explain our saying, “Forgive us our
debts,” he says: “And how necessarily, how providently and salutarily,
are we admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat
for our sins; and while pardon is asked for from God, the soul recalls
its own consciousness of guilt. Lest any one should flatter himself as
being innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is
instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden to
entreat daily for his sins. Thus, moreover, John also in his epistle
warns us, and says: ‘If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, He is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins.’” <span
id="fr_2871"></span>[2872](#fn_2871.md) Rightly, also, he proposed in his
letter to Quirinus his own most absolute judgment on this subject, to
which he subjoined the <span id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span
id="xviii.vi.xxvii-Page_430"></span>divine testimonies, “That no one is
without filth and without sin.” <span
id="fr_2872"></span>[2873](#fn_2872.md) There also he set down those
testimonies by which original sin is confirmed, which these men
endeavour to twist into I know not what new and evil meanings, whether
what the holy Job says, “No one is pure from filth, not one even if his
life be of one day upon the earth,” <span
id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873.md) or what is read in the Psalm,
“Behold, I was conceived in iniquity; and in sins hath my mother
nourished me in the womb.” <span id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874.md) To
which testimonies, on account of those also who are already holy in
mature age, since even they are not without filth and sin, he added also
that word of the most blessed John, which he often mentions in many
other places besides, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves;” <span id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875.md) and other
passages of the same sentiment, which are asserted by all catholics, by
way of opposing those “who deceive themselves, and the truth is not in
them.”
