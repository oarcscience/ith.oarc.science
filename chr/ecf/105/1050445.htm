<p><a name="xiv.lxiv-p2"></A>This is the concluding clause of their judgment. The synod said: &#8220;Now forasmuch as we have received satisfaction in these inquiries from the monk Pelagius, who has been present, who yields assent to godly doctrines, and rejects and anathematizes those which are contrary to the Church, we confess him still to belong to the communion of the catholic Church.&#8221; Now, there are two facts concerning the monk Pelagius here contained with entire perspicuity in this brief statement of the holy bishops who judged him: one, that &#8220;he yields assent to godly doctrines;&#8221; the other, that &#8220;he rejects and anathematizes those which are contrary to the Church.&#8221; On account of these two concessions, Pelagius was pronounced to be &#8220;in the communion of the catholic Church.&#8221; Let us, in pursuit of our inquiry, briefly recapitulate the entire facts, in order to discover what were the words he used which made those two points so clear, as far as men were able at the moment to form a judgment as to what were manifest points. For among the allegations which were made against him, he is said to have rejected and anathematized, as &#8220;contrary,&#8221; all the statements which in his answer he denied were his. Let us, then, summarize the whole case as far as we can.</p>
