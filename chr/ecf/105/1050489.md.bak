<span id="xv.iii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—Pelagius Says that Grace is
Given According to Men’s Merits. The Beginning, However, of Merit is
Faith; And This is a Gratuitous Gift, Not a Recompense for Our
Merits.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxxiv-p2"></span>Then, again, whatever it is which he
means by “grace,” he says is given even to Christians according to their
merits, although (as I have already mentioned above <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869) .md), when he was in Palestine, in his
very remarkable vindication of himself, he condemned those who hold this
opinion. Now these are his words: “In the one,” says he, “the good of
their created <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) condition is
naked and defenceless;” meaning in those who are not Christians. Then
adding the rest: “In these, however, who belong to Christ, there is
defence afforded by Christ’s help.” You see it is still uncertain what
the help is, according to the remark we have already made on the same
subject. He goes on, however, to say of those who are not Christians:
“Those deserve judgment and condemnation, because, although they possess
free will whereby they could come to have faith and deserve God’s grace,
they make a bad use of the freedom which has been granted to them. But
these deserve to be rewarded, who by the right use of free will merit
the Lord’s grace, and keep His commandments.” Now it is clear that he
says grace is bestowed according to merit, whatever and of what kind
soever the grace is which he means, but which he does not plainly
declare. For when he speaks of those persons as deserving reward who
make a good use of their free will, and as therefore meriting the Lord’s
grace, he asserts in fact that a debt is paid to them. What, then,
becomes of the apostle’s saying, “Being justified freely by His
grace”? <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) And what of his other
statement too, “By grace are ye saved”? <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) —where, that he might prevent <span
id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span
id="xv.iii.xxxiv-Page_229"></span>men’s supposing that it is by works,
he expressly added, “*by faith.*” <span
id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) And yet further, lest it should be
imagined that faith itself is to be attributed to men independently of
the grace of God, the apostle says: “And that not of yourselves; for it
is the gift of God.” <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) It
follows, therefore, that we receive, without any merit of our own, that
from which everything which, according to them, we obtain because of our
merit, has its beginning—that is, faith itself. If, however, they insist
on denying that this is freely given to us, what is the meaning of the
apostle’s words: “According as God hath dealt to every man the measure
of faith”? <span id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) But if it is
contended that faith is so bestowed as to be a recompense for merit, not
a free gift, what then becomes of another saying of the apostle: “Unto
you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but
also to suffer for His sake”? <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md)
Each is by the apostle’s testimony made a gift,—both that he believes in
Christ, and that each suffers for His sake. These men however, attribute
faith to free will in such a way as to make it appear that grace is
rendered to faith not as a gratuitous gift, but as a debt—thus ceasing
to be grace any longer, because that is not grace which is not
gratuitous.
