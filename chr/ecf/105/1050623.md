<span id="xvi.vi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[VI.\]—It is Not of Us, But Our
Sins, that the Devil is the Author.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xvii-p2"></span>He puts to us, then, another question,
saying, “Whom, then, do you confess to be the author of infants? The
true God?” I answer: <span id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231) “Yes;
the true God.” He then remarks, “But He did not make evil;” and again
asks, “Whether we confess the devil to be the creator of infants?” Then
again he answers, “But *he* did not create human nature.” He then closes
the subject, as it were, with this inference: “Since union is evil, and
the condition of our bodies is degraded, therefore you ascribe our
bodies to an evil creator.” My answer to this is, I do not ascribe to an
evil creator our bodies, but our sins; by reason of which it came to
pass that, whereas in our bodies, that is to say, in what God has made,
all was honourable and well-pleasing, there yet accrued in the
intercourse of male and female what caused shame, so that their union
was not such as might have been in the body of that unimpaired life, but
such as we see with a blush in the body of this death. “But God,” says
he, “has divided in sex what He would unite in operation. So that from
Him comes the union of bodies, from whom first came the creation of
bodies.” We have already furnished an answer to this statement, when we
said that these bodies are of God. But as regards the disobedience of
the members of these bodies, this comes through the lust of the flesh
which “is not of the Father.” <span id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232)
He goes on to say, that “it is impossible for evil fruits to spring from
so many good things, such as bodies, sexes, and their unions; or that
human beings should be made by God for the purpose of their being, by
lawful right, as you maintain, held in possession by the devil.” Now it
has been already affirmed, that they are not thus held because they are
men, which designation belongs to their nature, of which the devil is
not the author; but because they are sinners, which designation is the
result of that fault of nature of which the devil is the author.

<span id="xvi.vi.xvii-p3"></span> This is the Benedictine reading; but
another reading has “he answers,” which seems to suit the context. See
the following: “again *he* answers.”
