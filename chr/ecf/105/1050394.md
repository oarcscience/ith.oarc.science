<span id="xiv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—The Third Item in the Accusation;
And Pelagius’ Answer.</span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p2"></span>Another statement was read which Pelagius
had placed in his book, to this effect: “In the day of judgment no
forbearance will be shown to the ungodly and the sinners, but they will
be consumed in eternal fires.” This induced the brethren to regard the
statement as open to the objection, that it seemed so worded as to imply
that all sinners whatever were to be punished with an eternal
punishment, without excepting even those who hold Christ as their
foundation, although “they build thereupon wood, hay, stubble,” <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626) concerning whom the apostle writes:
“If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he shall
himself be saved, yet <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span
id="xiv.xiii-Page_187"></span>so as by fire.” <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627) When, however, Pelagius responded
that “he had made his assertion in accordance with the Gospel, in which
it is written concerning sinners, ‘These shall go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into life eternal,’” <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628) it was impossible for Christian
judges to be dissatisfied with a sentence which is written in the
Gospel, and was spoken by the Lord; especially as they knew not what
there was in the words taken from Pelagius’ book which could so disturb
the brethren, who were accustomed to hear his discussions and those of
his followers. Since also they were absent <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629) who presented the indictment
against Pelagius to the holy bishop Eulogius, there was no one to urge
him that he ought to distinguish, by some exception, between those
sinners who are to be saved by fire, and those who are to be punished
with everlasting perdition. If, indeed, the judges had come to
understand by these means the reason why the objection had been made to
his statement, had he then refused to allow the distinction, he would
have been justly open to blame.
