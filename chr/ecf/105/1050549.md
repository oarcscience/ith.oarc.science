<span id="xv.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38 \[XXXIII.\]—Original Sin Does
Not Render Marriage Evil.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span>But they argue thus, saying: “Is not,
then, marriage an evil, and the man that is produced by marriage not
God’s work?” As if the good of the married life were that disease of
concupiscence with which they who know not God love their wives—a course
which the apostle forbids; <span id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md)
and not rather that conjugal chastity, by which carnal lust is reduced
to the good purposes of the appointed procreation of children. Or as if,
forsooth, a man could possibly be anything <span id="page_250">p.
250</span> <span id="xv.iv.xxxviii-Page_250"></span>but God’s work, not
only when born in wedlock, but even if he be produced in fornication or
adultery. In the present inquiry, however, when the question is not for
what a Creator is necessary, but for what a Saviour, we have not to
consider what good there is in the procreation of nature, but what evil
there is in sin, whereby our nature has been certainly corrupted. No
doubt the two are generated simultaneously—both nature and nature’s
corruption; one of which is good, the other evil. The one comes to us
from the bounty of the Creator, the other is contracted from the
condemnation of our origin; the one has its cause in the good-will of
the Supreme God, the other in the depraved will of the first man; the
one exhibits God as the maker of the creature, the other exhibits God as
the punisher of disobedience: in short, the very same Christ was the
*maker* of man for the creation of the one, and was *made* <span
