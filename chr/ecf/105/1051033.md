<span id="xx.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49.—Conclusion.</span>

<span id="xx.lii-p2"></span>Hence, as far as concerns us, who are not
able to distinguish those who are predestinated from those who are not,
we ought on this very account to will all men to be saved. Severe rebuke
should be medicinally applied to all by us that they perish not
themselves, or that they may not be the means of destroying others. It
belongs to God, however, to make that rebuke useful to them whom He
Himself has foreknown and predestinated to be conformed to the image of
His Son. For, if at any time we abstain from rebuking, for fear lest by
rebuke a man should perish, why do we not also rebuke, for fear lest a
man should rather perish by our withholding it? For we have no greater
bowels of love than the blessed apostle who says, “Rebuke those that are
unruly; comfort the feeble-minded; support the weak; be patient towards
all men. See that none render to any man evil for evil.” <span
id="fr_3408"></span>[3409](#fn_3408) Where it is to be understood that
evil is then rather rendered for evil when one who ought to be rebuked
is not rebuked, but by a wicked dissimulation is neglected. He says,
moreover, “Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may
fear;” <span id="fr_3409"></span>[3410](#fn_3409) which must be received
concerning those sins which are not concealed, lest he be thought to
have spoken in opposition to the word of the Lord. For He says, “If thy
brother shall sin against thee, rebuke him between thee and him.” <span
id="fr_3410"></span>[3411](#fn_3410) Notwithstanding, He Himself carries
out the severity of rebuke to the extent of saying, “If he will not hear
the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.” <span
id="fr_3411"></span>[3412](#fn_3411) And who has more loved the weak
than He who became weak for us all, and of that very weakness was
crucified for us all? And since these things are so, grace neither
restrains rebuke, nor does rebuke restrain grace; and on this account
righteousness is so to be prescribed that we may ask in faithful prayer,
that, by God’s grace, what is prescribed may be done; and both of these
things are in such wise to be done that righteous rebuke may not be
neglected. But let all these things be done with love, since love both
does not sin, and does cover the multitude of sins.
