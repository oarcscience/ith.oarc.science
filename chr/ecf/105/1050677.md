<span id="xvii.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[V.\]—Another of Victor’s Errors,
that the Soul is Corporeal.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.v-p2"></span>But as regards his contention, “that the
soul is not spirit, but body,” what else can he mean to make out, than
that we are composed, not of soul and body, but of two or even three
bodies? For inasmuch as he says that we consist of spirit, soul and
body, and asserts that all the three are bodies; it follows, that he
supposes us to be made up of three bodies. How absurd this conclusion
is, I think ought rather to be demonstrated to him than to you. But this
is not an intolerable error on the part of a person who has not yet
discovered that there is in existence a something, which, though it be
not corporeal, yet may wear somewhat of the similitude of a body.
