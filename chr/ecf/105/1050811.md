id="xviii.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—The Fourth Calumny,—That the
Saints of the Old Testament are Said to Be Not Free from Sins.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xii-p2"></span>“They say,” says he, “that the saints
in the Old Testament were not without sins,—that is that they were not
free from crimes even by amendment, but they were seized by death in
their guilt.” Nay, I say that either before the law, or in the time of
the Old Testament, they were freed from sins,—not by their own power,
because “cursed is every one that hath put his hope in man,” <span
id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550.md) and without any doubt those are
under this curse whom also the sacred Psalm notifies, “who trust in
their own strength;” <span id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551.md) nor by
the old covenant which gendereth to bondage, <span
id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552.md) although it was divinely given by
the grace of a sure dispensation; nor by that law itself, holy and just
and good as it was, where it is written, “Thou shalt not covet,” <span
id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553.md) since it was not given as being
able to give life, but it was added for the sake of transgression until
the seed should come to whom the promise was made; but I say that they
were freed by the blood of the Redeemer Himself, who is the one Mediator
of God and man, the man Christ Jesus. <span
id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554.md) But those enemies of the grace of
God, which is given to small and great through Jesus Christ our Lord,
say that the men of God of old were of a perfect righteousness, lest
they should be supposed to have needed the incarnation, the passion, and
resurrection of Christ, by belief in whom they were saved.
