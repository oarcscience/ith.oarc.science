<span id="xx.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4—The Children of God are Led by the
Spirit of God.</span>

<span id="xx.vii-p2"></span>Let those, therefore, not deceive themselves
who ask, “Wherefore is it preached and prescribed to us that we should
turn away from evil and do good, if it is not we that do this, but ‘God
who worketh in us to will and to do it’?” <span
id="fr_3249"></span>[3250](#fn_3249.md) But let them rather understand that
if they are the children of God, they are led by the Spirit of God <span
id="fr_3250"></span>[3251](#fn_3250.md) to do that which should be done;
and when they have done it, let them give thanks to Him by whom they
act. For they are acted upon that they may act, not that they may
themselves do nothing; and in addition to this, it is shown them what
they ought to do, so that when they have done it as it ought to be
done—that is, with the love and the delight of righteousness—they may
rejoice in having received “the sweetness which the Lord has given, that
their  <span id="fr_3251"></span>[3252](#fn_3251.md) land should yield her
increase.” <span id="fr_3252"></span>[3253](#fn_3252.md) But when they do
not act, whether by not doing at all or by not doing from love, let them
pray that what as yet they have not, they may receive. For what shall
they have which they shall not receive? or what have they which they
have not received? <span id="fr_3253"></span>[3254](#fn_3253.md)
