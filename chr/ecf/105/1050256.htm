<p><a name="xii.xiii-p2"></A>See what he has said. I, however, affirm that an infant born in a place where it was not possible for him to be admitted to the baptism of Christ, and being overtaken by death, was placed in such circumstances, that is to say, died without the bath of regeneration, because it was not possible for him to be otherwise. He would therefore absolve him, and, in spite of the Lord&#146;s sentence, open to him the kingdom of heaven. The apostle, however, does not absolve him, when he says: &#8220;By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; by which death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1148"></A><A HREF="#fn_1148"><FONT SIZE="1">1149</FONT></A>
 Rightly, therefore, by virtue of that condemnation which runs throughout the mass, is he not admitted into the kingdom of heaven, although he was not only not a Christian, but was unable to become one.</p>
