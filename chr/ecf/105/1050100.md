<span id="x.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[IX.\]—An Objection of the
Pelagians: Why Does Not a Righteous Man Beget a Righteous Man? <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501) </span>

<span id="x.iv.xi-p3"></span>In vain, then, do some of them argue: “If a
sinner begets a sinner, so that the guilt of original sin must be done
away in his infant son by his receiving baptism, in like manner ought a
righteous man to beget a righteous son.” Just as if a man begat children
in the flesh by reason of his righteousness, and not because he is moved
thereto by the concupiscence which is in his members, and the law of sin
is applied by the law of his mind to the purpose of procreation. His
begetting children, therefore, shows that he still retains the old
nature among the children of this world; it does not arise from the fact
of his promotion to newness of life among the children of God. For “the
children of this world beget and are begotten.” <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502) Hence also what is born of them is
like them; for “that which is born of the flesh is flesh.” <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503) Only the children <span
id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span id="x.iv.xi-Page_49"></span>of God,
however, are righteous; but in so far as they are the children of God,
they do not carnally beget, because it is of the Spirit, and not of the
flesh, that they are themselves begotten. But as many of them as become
parents, beget children from the circumstance that they have not yet put
off the entire remains of their old nature in exchange for the perfect
renovation which awaits them. It follows, therefore, that every son who
is born in this old and infirm condition of his father’s nature, must
needs himself partake of the same old and infirm condition. In order,
then, that he may be begotten again, he must also himself be renewed by
the Spirit through the remission of sin; and if this change does not
take place in him, his righteous father will be of no use to him. For it
is by the Spirit that he is righteous, but it is not by the Spirit that
he begat his son. On the other hand, if this change does accrue to him,
he will not be damaged by an unrighteous father: for it is by the grace
of the Spirit that he has passed into the hope of the eternal newness;
whereas it is owing to his carnal mind that his father has wholly
remained in the old nature.
