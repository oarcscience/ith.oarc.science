that Conjugal Intercourse is Condemned.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.x-p2"></span>“They say also,” says he, “that sexual
impulse and the intercourse of married people were devised by the devil,
and that therefore those who are born innocent are guilty, and that it
is the work of the devil, not of God, that they are born of this
diabolical intercourse. And this, without any ambiguity, is Manicheism.”
Nay, as I say that marriage was appointed by God for the sake of the
ordinance of the begetting of children, so I say that the propagation of
children to be begotten could not have taken place without sexual
impulse, and without intercourse of husband and wife, even in Paradise,
if children were begotten there. But whether such impulse and
intercourse would have existed, as is now the case with shameful lust,
if no one had sinned, here is the question concerning which I shall
argue hereafter, if God will.
