<span id="xii.lxxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 78 \[LXV.\]—Jerome.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxxii-p2"></span>We have next a quotation of some words
of the venerable presbyter Jerome, from his exposition of the passage
where it is written: “‘Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see
God.’ <span id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329) These are they whom no
conscious<span id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span
id="xii.lxxxii-Page_149"></span>ness of sin reproves,” he says, and
adds: “The pure man is seen by his purity of heart; the temple of God
cannot be defiled.” <span id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330) This
perfection is, to be sure, wrought in us by endeavour, by labour, by
prayer, by effectual importunity therein that we may be brought to the
perfection in which we may be able to look upon God with a pure heart,
by His grace through our Lord Jesus Christ. As to his quotation, that
the forementioned presbyter said, “God created us with free will; we are
drawn by necessity neither to virtue nor to vice; otherwise, where there
is necessity there is no crown;”  <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331) —who would not allow this? Who
would not cordially accept it? Who would deny that human nature was so
created? The reason, however, why in doing a right action there is no
bondage of necessity, is that liberty comes of love.
