id="xi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Romans Interprets Corinthians.</span>

<span id="xi.xi-p2"></span>Attend, then, carefully, to the apostle while
in his Epistle to the Romans he explains and clearly enough shows that
what he wrote to the Corinthians, “The letter killeth, but the spirit
giveth life,” <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) must be understood
in the sense which we have already indicated,—that the letter of the
law, which teaches us not to commit sin, kills, if the life-giving
spirit be absent, forasmuch as it causes sin to be known rather than
avoided, and therefore to be increased rather than diminished, because
to an evil concupiscense there is now added the transgression of the
law.
