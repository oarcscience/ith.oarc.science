id="x.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Superabundance of Grace.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xiv-p2"></span>“But,” says he, “not as the offence so
also is the free gift. For if, through the offence of one, many be dead,
much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by One Man,
Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.” <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256) Not *many more*, that is, many more
men, for there are not more persons justified than condemned; but it
runs, *much more hath abounded*; inasmuch as, while Adam produced
sinners from his one sin, Christ has by His grace procured free
forgiveness even for the sins which men have of their own accord added
by actual transgression to the original sin in which they were born.
This he states more clearly still in the sequel.
