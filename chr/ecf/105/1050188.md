<span id="xi.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—Paul, Whence So Called; Bravely
Contends for Grace.</span>

<span id="xi.xv-p2"></span>Accordingly Paul, who, although he was
formerly called Saul, <span id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744) chose this
new designation, for no other reason, as it seems to me, than because he
would show himself *little*, <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745)
—the “least of the apostles,” <span id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746)
—contends with much courage and earnestness against the proud and
arrogant, and such as plume themselves on their own works, in order that
he may commend the grace of God. This grace, indeed, appeared more
obvious and manifest in his case, inasmuch as, while he was pursuing
such vehement measures of persecution against the Church of God as made
him worthy of the greatest punishment, he found mercy instead of
condemnation, and instead of punishment obtained grace. Very properly,
therefore, does he lift voice and hand in defence of grace, and care not
for the envy either of those who understood not a subject too profound
and abstruse for them, or of those who perversely misinterpreted his own
sound words; whilst at the same time he unfalteringly preaches that gift
of God, whereby alone salvation accrues to those who are the children of
the promise, children of the divine goodness, children of grace and
mercy, children of the new covenant. In the salutation with which he
begins every epistle, he prays: “Grace be to you, and peace, from God
the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ;” <span
id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747) whilst this forms almost the only
topic discussed for the Romans, and it is plied with so much persistence
and variety of argument, as fairly to fatigue the reader’s attention,
yet with a fatigue so useful and salutary, that it rather exercises than
breaks the faculties of the inner man.
