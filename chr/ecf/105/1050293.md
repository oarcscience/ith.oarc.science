<span id="xii.l-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46 \[XXXIX.\]—Shall We Follow Scripture,
or Add to Its Declarations?</span>

<span id="xii.l-p2"></span>It is, to be sure, a grand sentence with
which he concluded this passage, when he says: “What we read, therefore,
let us believe; and what we do not read, let us deem it wicked to add;
and let it suffice to have said this of all cases.” On the contrary, I
for my part say that we ought not to believe even everything that we
read, on the sanction of the apostle’s advice: “Read all things; hold
fast that which is good.” <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240) Nor
is it wicked to add something which we have not read; for it is in our
power to add something which we have *<span id="xii.l-p3.2"></span>bona
fide*experienced as witnesses, even if it so happens that we have not
read about it. Perhaps he will say in reply: “When I said this, I was
treating of the Holy Scriptures.” Oh how I wish that he were never
willing to add, I will not say anything but what he reads in the
Scriptures, but in opposition to what he reads in them; that he would
only faithfully and obediently hear that which is written there: “By one
man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed
upon all men; in which all have sinned;” <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241) and that he would not weaken the
grace of the great Physician,—all by his unwillingness to confess that
human nature is corrupted! Oh how I wish that he would, as a Christian,
read the sentence, “There is none other name under heaven given among
men whereby we must be saved;” <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242) and that he would not so uphold the
possibility of human nature, as to believe that man can be saved by free
will without that Name!
