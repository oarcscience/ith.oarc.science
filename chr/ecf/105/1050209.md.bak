<span id="xi.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—The Prophecy of Jeremiah
Concerning the New Testament.</span>

<span id="xi.xxxvi-p2"></span>Observe this also in that testimony which
was given by the prophet on this subject in the clearest way: “Behold,
the days come, saith the Lord, that I will consummate a new covenant
with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to
the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took
them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. Because they
continued not in my covenant, I also have rejected them, saith the Lord.
But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of
Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their
inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and
they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his
neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they
shall all know me, from the least unto the greatest of them, saith the
Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin
no more.”  <span id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md) What say we to this?
One nowhere, or hardly anywhere, except in this passage of the prophet,
finds in the Old Testament Scriptures any mention so made of the New
Testament as to indicate it by its very name. It is no doubt often
referred to and foretold as about to be given, but not so plainly as to
have its very name mentioned. Consider then carefully, what difference
God has testified as existing between the two testaments—the old
covenant and the new.
