<span id="xx.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—The Catholic Faith Concerning Law,
Grace, and Free Will.</span>

<span id="xx.v-p2"></span>Now the Lord Himself not only shows us what
evil we should shun, and what good we should do, which is all that the
letter of the law is able to effect; but He moreover helps us that we
may shun evil and do good, <span id="fr_3238"></span>[3239](#fn_3238.md)
which none can do without the Spirit of grace; and if this be wanting,
the law comes in merely to make us guilty and to slay us. It is on this
account that the apostle says, “The letter killeth, but the Spirit
giveth life.” <span id="fr_3239"></span>[3240](#fn_3239.md) He, then, who
lawfully uses the law learns therein evil and good, and, not trusting in
his own strength, flees to grace, by the help of which he may shun evil
and do good. But who is there who flees to grace except when “the steps
of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He shall determine his way”? <span
id="fr_3240"></span>[3241](#fn_3240.md) And thus also to desire the help of
grace is the beginning of grace; of which, says he, “And I said, Now I
have begun; this is the change of the right hand of the Most
High.” <span id="fr_3241"></span>[3242](#fn_3241.md) It is to be confessed,
therefore, that we have free choice to do both evil and good; but in
doing evil every one is free from righteousness and a servant of sin,
while in doing good no one can be free, unless he have been made free by
Him who said, “If the Son shall make you free, then you shall be free
indeed.” <span id="fr_3242"></span>[3243](#fn_3242.md) Neither is it thus,
that when any one has been made free from the dominion of sin, he no
longer needs the help of his Deliverer; but rather thus, that hearing
from Him, “Without me ye can do nothing,” <span
id="fr_3243"></span>[3244](#fn_3243.md) he himself also says to Him, “Be
thou my helper! Forsake me not.” <span
id="fr_3244"></span>[3245](#fn_3244.md) I rejoice that I have found in our
brother Florus also this faith, which without doubt is the true and
prophetical and apostolical and catholic faith; whence those are the
rather to be corrected—whom indeed I now think to have been corrected by
the favour of God—who did not understand him.
