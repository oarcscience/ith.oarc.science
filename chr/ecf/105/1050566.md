<span id="xvi.v.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Concerning the Argument of This
Treatise.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xvi.v.i-p2.1"></span>Our</span> new heretics, my dearest son
Valerius, who maintain that infants born in the flesh have no need of
that medicine of Christ whereby sins are healed, are constantly
affirming, in their excessive hatred of us, that we condemn marriage and
that divine procedure by which God creates human beings by means of men
and women, inasmuch as we assert that they who are born of such a union
contract that original sin of which the apostle says, “By one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all
men, for in him all sinned;” <span id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059)
and because we do not deny, that of whatever kind of parents they are
born, they are still under the devil’s dominion, unless they be born
again in Christ, and by His grace be removed from the power of darkness
and translated into His kingdom, <span
id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060) who willed not to be born from the
same union of the two sexes. Because, then, we affirm this doctrine,
which is contained in the oldest and unvarying rule of the catholic
faith, these propounders of the novel and perverse dogma, who assert
that there is no sin in infants to be washed away in the laver of
regen<span id="page_264">p. 264</span> <span
id="xvi.v.i-Page_264"></span>eration, <span
id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061) in their unbelief or ignorance
calumniate us, as if we condemned marriage, and as if we asserted to be
the devil’s work what is God’s own work—the human being which is born of
marriage. Nor do they reflect that the good of marriage is no more
impeachable on account of the original evil which is derived therefrom,
than the evil of adultery and fornication is excusable on account of the
natural good which is born of them. For as sin is the work of the devil,
from whencesoever contracted by infants; so man is the work of God, from
whencesoever born. Our purpose, therefore, in this book, so far as the
Lord vouchsafes us in His help, is to distinguish between the evil of
carnal concupiscence from which man who is born therefrom contracts
original sin, and the good of marriage. For there would have been none
of this shame-producing concupiscence, which is impudently praised by
impudent men, if man had not previously sinned; while as to marriage, it
would still have existed even if no man had sinned, since the
procreation of children in the body that belonged to that life would
have been effected without that malady which in “the body of this
death” <span id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062) cannot be separated
from the process of procreation.
