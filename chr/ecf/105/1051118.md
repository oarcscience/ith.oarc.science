id="xxi.iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—The Preaching of the Gospel
and the Preaching of Predestination the Two Parts of One Message.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxxviii-p2"></span>Therefore, by the preaching of
predestination, the preaching of a persevering and progressive faith is
not to be hindered; and thus they may hear what is necessary to whom it
is given that they should obey. For how shall they hear without a
preacher? Neither, again, is the preaching of a progressive faith which
continues even to the end to hinder the preaching of predestination, so
that he who is living faithfully and <span id="page_540">p. 540</span>
<span id="xxi.iii.xxxviii-Page_540"></span>obediently may not be lifted
up by that very obedience, as if by a benefit of his own, not received;
but that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord. For “we must boast in
nothing, since nothing is our own.” And this, Cyprian most faithfully
saw and most fearlessly explained, and thus he pronounced predestination
to be most assured. <span id="fr_3648"></span>[3649](#fn_3648) For if we
must boast in nothing, seeing that nothing is our own, certainly we must
not boast of the most persevering obedience. Nor is it so to be called
our own, as if it were not given to us from above. And, therefore, it is
God’s gift, which, by the confession of all Christians, God foreknew
that He would give to His people, who were called by that calling
whereof it was said, “The gifts and calling of God are without
repentance.” <span id="fr_3649"></span>[3650](#fn_3649) This, then, is
the predestination which we faithfully and humbly preach. Nor yet did
the same teacher and doer, who both believed on Christ and most
perseveringly lived in holy obedience, even to suffering for Christ,
cease on that account to preach the gospel, to exhort to faith and to
pious manners, and to that very perseverance to the end, because he
said, “We must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own;” and here he
declared without ambiguity the true grace of God, that is, that which is
not given in respect of our merits; and since God foreknew that He would
give it, predestination was announced beyond a doubt by these words of
Cyprian; and if this did not prevent Cyprian from preaching obedience,
it certainly ought not to prevent us.
