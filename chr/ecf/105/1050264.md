id="xii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[XVI.\]—Explanation of This Text
Continued.</span>

<span id="xii.xxi-p2"></span>Accordingly, after emphatically describing
the evil of the tongue—saying, among other things: “My brethren, these
things ought not so to be” <span id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164)
—he at once, after finishing some remarks which arose out of his
subject, goes on to add this advice, showing by what help those things
would not happen, which (as he said) ought not: “Who is a wise man and
endowed with knowledge among you? Let him show out of a good
conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter
envying and strife in your hearts, glory not and lie not against the
truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
devilish. For where there is envying and strife, there is confusion and
every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good
fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.” <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165) This is the wisdom which tames the
tongue; it descends from above, and springs from no human heart. Will
any one, then, dare to divorce it from the grace of God, and with most
arrogant vanity place it in the power of man? Why should I pray to God
that it be accorded me, if it may be had of man? Ought we not to object
to this prayer lest injury be done to free will which is self-sufficient
in the possibility of nature for discharging all the duties of
righteousness? We ought, then, to object also to the Apostle James
himself, who admonishes us in these words: “If any of you lack wisdom,
let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
not, and it shall be given him; but let him ask in faith, nothing
doubting.” <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166) This is the faith
to which the commandments drive us, in order that the law may prescribe
our duty and faith accomplish it. <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167) For through the tongue, which no
man can tame, but only the wisdom which comes down from above, “in many
things we all of us offend.” <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168)
For this truth also the same apostle pronounced in no other sense than
that in which he afterwards declares: “The tongue no man can
tame.” <span id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169)
