<span id="xii.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—Whether Holy Men Have Died Without
Sin.</span>

<span id="xii.xlv-p2"></span>But there is clearly much acuteness in the
question put by our author, “How must we suppose that those holy men
quitted this life,—with sin, or without sin?” For if we answer, “With
sin,” condemnation will be supposed to have been their destiny, which it
is shocking to imagine; but if it be said that they departed this life
“without sin,” then it would be a proof that man had been without sin in
his present life, at all events, when death was approaching. But, with
all his acuteness, he overlooks the circumstance that even righteous
persons not without good reason offer up this prayer: “Forgive us our
debts, as we forgive our debtors;” <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md) and that the Lord Christ, after
explaining the prayer in His teaching, most truly added: “For if ye
forgive men their trespasses, your Father will also forgive you your
trespasses.” <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md) Here, indeed, we
have the daily incense, so to speak, of the Spirit, which is offered to
God on the altar of the heart, which we are bidden “to lift
up,”—implying that, even if we cannot live here without sin, we may yet
die without sin, when in merciful forgiveness the sin is blotted out
which is committed in ignorance or infirmity.
