<span id="xvii.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—The Thirst of the Rich Man in
Hell Does Not Prove the Soul to Be Corporeal.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.viii-p2"></span>Now with regard to the point, which
with perfect propriety and great soundness of view he believes, that
souls after quitting the body are judged, before they come to that final
judgment to which they must submit when their bodies are restored to
them, and are either tormented or glorified in the very same flesh
wherein they once lived here on earth; is it, let me ask you, the case
that you were really ignorant of this? Who ever had his mind so
obstinately set against the gospel as not to hear these truths, and
after hearing to believe them, in the parable of the poor man who was
carried away after death to Abraham’s bosom, and of the rich man who is
set forth as suffering torment in hell? <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) But has this man taught you how it
was that the soul apart from the body could crave from the beggar’s
finger a drop of water; <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) when
he himself confessed, that the soul did not require bodily aliment
except for the purpose of protecting the perishing body which encloses
it from dissolution? These are his words: “Is it,” asks he, “because the
soul craves meat and drink, that we suppose material food passes into
it?” Then shortly afterwards he says: “From this circumstance it is
understood and proved, that the sustenance of meat and drink is not
wanted for the soul, but for the body: for which clothing also, in
addition to food, is provided in like manner; so that the supplying of
food seems to be necessary to that nature, which is also fitted for
wearing clothes.” This opinion of his he expounds clearly enough; but he
adds some illustrative similes, and says: “Now what do we suppose the
occupier of a house does on an inspection of his dwelling? If he observe
the tenement has a shaky roof, or a nodding wall, or a weak foundation,
does he not fetch girders and build up buttresses, in order that he may
succeed in propping up by his care and diligence the fabric which
threatened to fall, so that in the dangerous plight of the residence the
peril which evidently overhung the occupier might be warded off? From
this simile,” says he, “see how the soul craves for its flesh, from
which it undoubtedly conceives the craving itself.” Such are the very
lucid and adequate words in which this young person has explained his
ideas: he asserts that it is not the soul, but the body, which requires
food; out of a careful regard, no doubt, of the former for the latter,
as one that occupies a dwelling-house, and by a prudent repair prevents
the downfall with which the fleshly tenement was threatened. Well, now,
let him go on to explain to you what probable ruin this particular soul
of the rich man was so eager to prevent by propping up, seeing that it
no longer possessed a mortal body, and yet suffered thirst, and begged
for the drop of water from the poor man’s finger. Here is a good knotty
question for this astute instructor of elderly men to exercise himself
on; let him inquire, and find a solution if he can: for what purpose did
that soul in hell beg the aliment of ever so small a drop of water, when
it had no ruinous tenement to support?
