<span id="xii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33 \[XXIX.\]—Not Every Sin is Pride.
How Pride is the Commencement of Every Sin.</span>

<span id="xii.xxxvii-p2"></span>“But how,” asks he, “shall we separate
pride itself from sin?” Now, why does he raise such a question, when it
is manifest that even pride itself is a sin? “To sin,” says he, “is
quite as much to be proud, as to be proud is to sin; for only ask what
every sin is, and see whether you can find any sin without the
designation of pride.” Then he thus pursues this opinion, and endeavours
to prove it thus: “Every sin,” says he, “if I mistake not, is a contempt
of God, and every contempt of God is pride. For what is so proud as to
despise God? All sin, then, is also pride, even as Scripture says, Pride
is the beginning of all sin.” <span id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209)
Let him seek diligently, and he will find in the law that the sin of
pride is quite distinguished from all other sins. For many sins are
committed through pride; but yet not all things which are wrongly done
are done proudly,—at any rate, not by the ignorant, not by the infirm,
and not, generally speaking, by the weeping and sorrowful. And indeed
pride, although it be in itself a great sin, is of such sort in itself
alone apart from others, that, as I have already remarked, it for the
most part follows after and steals with more rapid foot, not so much
upon sins as upon things which are actually well done. However, that
which he has understood in another sense, is after all most truly said:
“Pride is the commencement of all sin;” because it was this which
overthrew the devil, from whom arose the origin of sin; and afterwards,
when his malice and envy pursued man, who was yet standing in his
uprightness, it subverted him in the same way in which he himself fell.
For the serpent, in fact, only sought for the door of pride whereby to
enter when he said, “Ye shall be as gods.” <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210) Truly then is it said, “Pride is
the commencement of all sin;” <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211)
and, “The beginning of pride is when a man departeth from God.” <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212)
