<span id="xix.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Faith Without Good Works is
Not Sufficient for Salvation.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xviii-p2"></span>Unintelligent persons, however, with
regard to the apostle’s statement: “We conclude that a man is justified
by faith without the works of the law,” <span
id="fr_3050"></span>[3051](#fn_3050) have thought him to mean that faith
suffices to a man, even if he lead a bad life, and has no good works.
Impossible is it that such a character should be deemed “a vessel of
election” by the apostle, who, after declaring that “in Christ Jesus
neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision,” <span
id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051) adds at once, “but faith which
worketh by love.” It is such faith which severs God’s faithful from
unclean demons,—for even these “believe and tremble,” <span
id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052) as the Apostle James says; but they
do not do well. Therefore they possess not the faith by which the just
man lives,—the faith which works by love in such wise, that God
recompenses it according to its works with eternal life. But inasmuch as
we have even our good works from God, from whom likewise comes our faith
and our love, therefore the selfsame great teacher of the Gentiles has
designated “eternal life” itself as His gracious “gift.” <span
