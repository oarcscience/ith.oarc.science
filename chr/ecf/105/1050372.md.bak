<span id="xiii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xl-p1.1"></span>(36.) The Difference Between the Upright in
Heart and the Clean in Heart.</span>

<span id="xiii.xl-p2"></span>I suppose, too, that there is a difference
between one who is upright in heart and one who is clean in heart. A man
is upright in heart when he “reaches forward to those things which are
before, forgetting those things which are behind” <span
id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) so as to arrive in a right course,
that is, with right faith and purpose, at the perfection where he may
dwell clean and pure in heart. Thus, in the psalm, the conditions ought
to be severally bestowed on each separate character, where it is said,
“Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His
holy place? He that is innocent in his hands, and clean in his
heart.” <span id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) He shall ascend,
innocent in his hands, and stand, clean in his heart,—the one state in
present operation, the other in its consummation. And of them should
rather be understood that which is written: “Riches are good unto him
that hath no sin on his conscience.” <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) Then indeed shall accrue the good,
or true riches, when all poverty shall have passed away; in other words,
when all infirmity shall have been removed. A man may now indeed “leave
off from sin,” when in his onward course he departs from it, and is
renewed day by day; and he may “order his hands,” and direct them to
works of mercy, and “cleanse his heart from all wickedness,” <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) —he may be so merciful that what
remains may be forgiven him by free pardon. This indeed is the sound and
suitable meaning, without any vain and empty boasting, of that which St.
John said: “If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward
God. And whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him.” <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) The warning which he clearly has
addressed to us in this passage, is to beware lest our heart should
reproach us in our very prayers and petitions; that is to say, lest,
when we happen to resort to this prayer, and say, “Forgive us, even as
we ourselves forgive, we should have to feel compunction for not doing
what we say, or should even lose boldness to utter what we fail to do,
and thereby forfeit the confidence of faithful and earnest prayer.
