<span id="xiv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—The Same Continued. Pelagius
Acknowledges the Doctrine of Grace in Deceptive Terms.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p2"></span>There can be no doubt that what Pelagius
has acknowledged as his own is as yet very obscure. I suppose, however,
that it will become apparent in the subsequent details of these
proceedings. Now he says: “We have affirmed that a man is able to be
without sin, and to keep the commandments of God if he wishes, inasmuch
as God has given him this ability. But we have not said that any man can
be found, who from infancy to old age has never committed sin; but that
if any person were converted from his sins, he could by his own exertion
and God’s grace <span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span
id="xiv.xxiv-Page_192"></span>be without sin; and yet not even thus
would he be incapable of change afterwards.” Now it is quite uncertain
what he means in these words by the grace of God; and the judges,
catholic as they were, could not possibly understand by the phrase
anything else than the grace which is so very strongly recommended to us
in the apostle’s teaching. Now this is the grace whereby we hope that we
can be delivered from the body of this death through our Lord Jesus
Christ, <span id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) \[VII.\] and for the
obtaining of which we pray that we may not be led into temptation. <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md) This grace is not nature, but that
which renders assistance to frail and corrupted nature. This grace is
not the knowledge of the law, but is that of which the apostle says: “I
will not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the
law, then Christ is dead in vain.” <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md) Therefore it is not “the letter
that killeth, but the life-giving spirit.” <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657.md) For the knowledge of the law,
without the grace of the Spirit, produces all kinds of concupiscence in
man; for, as the apostle says, “I had not known sin but by the law: I
had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But
sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of
concupiscence.” <span id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) By saying
this, however, he blames not the law; he rather praises it, for he says
afterwards: “The law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
and good.” <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md) And he goes on to
ask: “Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But
sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is
good.” <span id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md) And, again, he praises
the law by saying: “We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal,
sold under sin. For that which I do I know not: for what I would, that
do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would
not, I consent unto the law that it is good.” <span
id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) Observe, then, he knows the law,
praises it, and consents to it; for what it commands, that he also
wishes; and what it forbids, and condemns, that he also hates: but for
all that, what he hates, that he actually does. There is in his mind,
therefore, a knowledge of the holy law of God, but still his evil
concupiscence is not cured. He has a good will within him, but still
what he does is evil. Hence it comes to pass that, amidst the mutual
struggles of the two laws within him,—“the law in his members warring
against the law of his mind, and making him captive to the law of
sin,” <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md) —he confesses his
misery; and exclaims in such words as these: “O wretched man that I am!
who shall deliver me from this body of death? The grace of God, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md)
