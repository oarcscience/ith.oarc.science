<span id="xv.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22 \[XXI.\]—Love is a Good
Will.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxii-p2"></span>That love, however, which is a virtue,
comes to us from God, not from ourselves, according to the testimony of
Scripture, which says: “Love is of God; and every one that loveth is
born of God, and knoweth God: for God is love.” <span
id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831.md) It is on the principle of this love
that one can best understand the passage, “Whosoever is born of God doth
not commit sin;” <span id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832.md) as well as
the sentence, “And he cannot sin.” <span
id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md) Because the love according to which
we are born of God “doth not behave itself unseemly,” and “thinketh no
evil.” <span id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) Therefore, whenever a
man sins, it is not according to love: but it is according to cupidity
that he commits sin; and following such a disposition, he is not born of
God. Because, as it has been already stated, “the capacity” of which we
speak is capable of either root. When, therefore, the Scripture says,
“Love is of God,” or still more pointedly, “God is love;” when the
Apostle John so very emphatically exclaims, “Behold what manner of love
the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and be, the
sons of God!” <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) with what face
can this writer, on hearing that “God is love,” persist in maintaining
his opinion, that we bare of God one only of those three, <span
id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) namely, “the capacity;” whereas it
is of ourselves that we have “the good will” and “the good action?” As
if, indeed, this good will were a different thing from that love which
the Scripture so loudly proclaims to have come to us from God, and to
have been given to us by the Father, that we might become His children.
