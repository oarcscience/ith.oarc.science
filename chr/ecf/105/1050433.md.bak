id="xiv.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48 \[XXIV.\]—A Letter Written by
Timasius and Jacobus to Augustin on Receiving His Treatise “On Nature
and Grace.”</span>

<span id="xiv.lii-p2"></span>“To his lordship, the truly blessed and
deservedly venerable father, Bishop Augustin, Timasius and Jacobus send
greeting in the Lord. We have been so greatly refreshed and strengthened
by the grace of God, which your word has ministered to us, my lord, our
truly blessed and justly venerated father, that we may with the utmost
sincerity and propriety say, ‘He sent His word and healed them.’ <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744.md) We have found, indeed, that your
holiness has so thoroughly sifted the contents of his little book as to
astonish us with the answers with which even the slightest points of his
error have been confronted, whether it be on matters which every
Christian ought to rebut, loathe, and avoid, or on those in which he is
not with sufficient certainty found to have erred,—although even in
these he has, with incredible subtlety, suggested his belief that God’s
grace should be kept out of sight. <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745.md) There is, however, one
consideration which affects us under so great a benefit,—that this most
illustrious gift of the grace of God has, however slowly, so fully shone
out upon us. If, indeed, it has happened that some are removed from the
influence of this clearest light of truth, whose blindness required its
illumination, yet even to them, we doubt not, the same grace will find
its steady way, however late, by the merciful favour of that God ‘who
will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the
truth.’ <span id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md) As for ourselves,
indeed, thanks to that loving spirit which is in you, we have, in
consequence of your instruction, some time since thrown off our
subjection to his errors; but we still have even now cause for continued
gratitude in the fact that, as we have been informed, the false opinions
which we formerly believed are now becoming apparent to others—a way of
escape opening out to them in the extremely precious discourse of your
holiness.” Then, in another hand: “May the mercy of our God keep your
blessedness in safety, and mindful of us, for His eternal glory.” <span
