<span id="xviii.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15 \[IX.\]—He Sins in Will Who is
Only Deterred from Sinning by Fear.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xv-p2"></span>Nor let us be disturbed by what he
wrote to the Philippians: “Touching the righteousness which is in the
law, one who is without blame.” For he could be within in evil
affections a transgressor of the law, and yet fulfil the open works of
the law, either by the fear of men or of God Himself; but by terror of
punishment, not by love and delight in righteousness. For it is one
thing to do good with the will of doing good, and another thing to be so
inclined by the will to do evil, that one would actually do it if it
could be allowed without punishment. For thus assuredly he is sinning
within in his will itself, who abstains from sin not by will but by
fear. And knowing himself to have been such in these his internal
affections, before the grace of God which is through Jesus Christ our
Lord, the apostle elsewhere confesses this very plainly. For writing to
the Ephesians, he says: “And you, though ye were dead in your trespasses
and sins, wherein sometime ye walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of that spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience, in whom also we all at
one time had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh, doing the will
of our flesh and our affections, and were by nature the children of
wrath, even as others also: but God, who is rich in mercy, for His great
love wherewith He loved us even when we were dead in sins, quickened us
together with Christ, by whose grace we are saved.” Again to Titus he
says: “For we ourselves also were sometime foolish and unbelieving,
erring, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy,
hateful, and holding one another in hatred.” Such was Saul when he says
that he was, touching the righteousness which is in the law, without
reproach. For that he had not pressed on in the law, and changed his
character so as to be without reproach after this hateful life, he
plainly shows in what follows, when he says that he was not changed from
these evils except by the grace of the Saviour. For adding also this
very thing, here as well as to the Ephesians, he says: “But when the
kindness and love of God our Saviour shone forth, not by works of
righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved
us, by the washing of regeneration, and of the renewal of the Holy
Spirit, whom He shed on us most abundantly, through Jesus Christ our
Saviour, that being justified by His grace we should be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.”
