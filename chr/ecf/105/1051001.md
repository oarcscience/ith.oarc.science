<span id="xx.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[VIII.\]—Why Perseverance Should Be
Given to One and Not Another is Inscrutable.</span>

<span id="xx.xx-p2"></span>Here, if I am asked why God should not have
given them perseverance to whom He gave that love by which they might
live Christianly, I answer that I do not know. For I do not speak
arrogantly, but with acknowledgment of my small measure, when I hear the
apostle saying, “O man, who art thou that repliest against God?” <span
id="fr_3301"></span>[3302](#fn_3301.md) and, “O the depth of the riches of
the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and
His ways untraceable!” <span id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302.md) So
far, therefore, as He condescends to manifest His judgments to us, let
us give thanks; but so far as He thinks fit to conceal them, let us not
murmur against His counsel, but believe that this also is the most
wholesome for us. But whoever you are that are hostile to His grace, and
thus ask, what do you yourself say? it is well that you do not deny
yourself to be a Christian and boast of being a catholic. If, therefore,
you confess that to persevere to the end in good is God’s gift, I think
that equally with me you are ignorant why one man should receive this
gift and another should not receive it; and in this case we are both
unable to penetrate the unsearchable judgments of God. Or if you say
that it pertains to man’s free will—which you defend, not in accordance
with God’s grace, but in opposition to it—that any one should persevere
in good, or should not persevere, and it is not by the gift of God if he
persevere, but by the performance of human will, why will you strive
against the words of Him who says, “I have prayed for thee, Peter, that
thy faith fail not”? <span id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303.md) Will you
dare to say that even when Christ prayed that Peter’s faith might not
fail, it would still have failed if Peter had willed it to fail; that
is, if he had been unwilling that it should continue even to the end? As
if Peter could in any measure will otherwise than Christ had asked for
him that he might will. For who does not know that Peter’s faith would
then have perished if that will by which he was faithful should fail,
and that it would have continued if that same will should abide? But
because “the will is prepared by the Lord,” <span
id="fr_3304"></span>[3305](#fn_3304.md) therefore Christ’s petition on his
behalf could not be a vain petition. When, then, He prayed that his
faith should not fail, what was it that he asked for, but that in his
faith he should have a most free, strong, invincible, persevering will!
Behold to what an extent the freedom of the will is defended in
accordance with the grace of God, not in opposition to it; because the
human will does not attain grace by freedom, but rather attains freedom
by grace, and a delightful constancy, and an insuperable fortitude that
it may persevere.
