<span id="xix.ii-p6"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xix.ii-p6.1"></span>There</span> are some persons who suppose that
the freedom of the will is denied whenever God’s grace is maintained,
and who on their side defend their liberty of will so peremptorily as to
deny the grace of God. This grace, as they assert, is bestowed according
to our own merits. It is in consequence of their opinions that I wrote
the book entitled *On Grace and Free Will.* This work I addressed to the
monks of Adrumetum,  <span id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913.md) in whose
monastry first arose the controversy on that subject, and that in such a
manner that some of them were obliged to consult me thereon. The work
begins with these words: “With reference to those persons who so preach
the liberty of the human will.”

<span id="xix.ii-p7"></span> Adrumetum, a maritime city of Africa, was
the metropolis of the Province of Byzacium, as Procopius informs us, *De
Aedificiis Justiniani* <span class="c16"><span
id="xix.ii-p7.1"></span>VI</span>. It was in a monastery here that the
monks resided for whose instruction Augustin composed the two following
treatises,—the former entitled *De Gratiâ et Libero Arbitrio*, and the
latter *De Correptione et Gratiâ,* in the year of Christ 426 or 427. In
our opinion, no later date can be well assigned to these writings,
inasmuch as they are mentioned in *The Retractations*, which was
published about the year 427; nor can they be placed earlier in date,
because they are in that work mentioned the very last.
