<span id="xviii.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—The Old Testament is Properly
One Thing—The Old Instrument Another.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xii-p2"></span>Therefore, by a custom of speech
already prevailing, in one way the law and all the prophets who
prophesied until John are called the “Old Testament;” although this is
more definitely called the “Old Instrument” rather than the “Old
Testament;” but this name is used in another way by the apostolical
authority, whether expressly or impliedly. For the apostle is express
when he says, “Until this day, as long as Moses is read, remaineth the
same veil in the reading of the old testament; because it is not
revealed, because it is made of no effect in Christ.” <span
id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721.md) For thus certainly the old
testament referred to the ministry of Moses. Moreover, he says, “That we
should serve in the newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the
letter,” <span id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722.md) signifying that same
testament under the name of the letter. In another place also, “Who also
hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but
of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit maketh
alive.” <span id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723.md) And here, by the
mention of the new, he certainly meant the former to be understood as
the old. But much more evidently, although he did not say either old or
new, he distinguished the two testaments and the two sons of Abraham,
the one of the bondwoman, the other of the free, as I have above
mentioned. For what can be more express than his saying, “Tell me, ye
that desire to be under the law, have ye not heard the law? For it is
written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by
a freewoman. But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh;
but he of the freewoman was by promise. Which things are in allegory;
for these are the two testaments; the one in the Mount Sinai, gendering
to bondage, which is Agar. For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which is
associated with Jerusalem which now is, for it is in bondage with her
children. But Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our
mother?” <span id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724.md) What is more clear,
what more certain, what more remote from all obscurity and ambiguity to
the children of the promise? And a little after, “Now we, brethren, as
Isaac was, are the children of promise.” <span
id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725.md) Also a little after, “But we,
brethren, are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free,” <span
id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726.md) with the liberty with which Christ
has made us free. Let us, therefore, choose whether to call the
righteous men of old the children of the bondwoman or of the free. Be it
far from us to say, of the bondwoman; therefore if of the free, they
pertain to the new testament in the Holy Spirit, whom, as making alive,
the apostle opposes to the killing letter. For on what ground do they
not belong to the grace of the new testament, from whose words and looks
we convict and rebut such most frantic and ungrateful enemies of the
same grace as these?
