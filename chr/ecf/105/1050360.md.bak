<span id="xiii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>(24.) To Be Without Sin, and to Be Without
Blame—How Differing.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxviii-p2"></span>The same thing is affirmed in another
passage, which he has quoted immediately afterwards, as spoken by the
same Job: “Behold, I am very near my judgment, and I know that I shall
be found righteous.” <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) Now this
is the judgment of which it is said in another scripture: “And He shall
bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the
noonday.” But he does not say, I am already there; but, “I am very
near.” If, indeed, the judgment of his which he meant was not that which
he would himself exercise, but that whereby he was to be judged at the
last day, then in such judgment all will be found righteous who with
sincerity pray: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) For it is through this forgiveness
that they will be found righteous; on this account that whatever sins
they have here incurred, they have blotted out by their deeds of
charity. Whence the Lord says: “Give alms; and, behold, all things are
clean unto you.” <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) For in the
end, it shall be said to the righteous, when about to enter into the
promised kingdom: “I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat,” <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) and so forth. However, it is one
thing to be without sin, which in this life can only be predicated of
the Only-begotten, and another thing to be without accusation, which
might be said of many just persons even in the present life; for there
is a certain measure of a good life, according to which even in this
human intercourse there could no just accusation be possibly laid
against him. For <span id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span
id="xiii.xxviii-Page_168"></span>who can justly accuse the man who
wishes evil to no one, and who faithfully does good to all he can, and
never cherishes a wish to avenge himself on any man who does him wrong,
so that he can truly say, “As we forgive our debtors?” And yet by the
very fact that he truly says, “Forgive, as we also forgive,” he plainly
admits that he is not without sin.
