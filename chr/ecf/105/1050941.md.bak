<span id="xix.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Grace is Necessary Along with
Free Will to Lead a Good Life.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.vii-p2"></span>Therefore, my dearly beloved, as we have
now proved by our former testimonies from Holy Scripture that there is
in man a free determination of will for living rightly and acting
rightly; so now let us see what are the divine testimonies concerning
the grace of God, without which we are not able to do any good thing.
And first of all, I will say something about the very profession which
you make in your brotherhood. Now your society, in which you are leading
lives of continence, could not hold together unless you de<span

conjugal pleasure. Well, the Lord was one day conversing on this very
topic, when His disciples remarked to Him, “If such be the case of a man
with his wife, it is not good to marry.” He then answered them, “All men
cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.” <span
id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) And was it not to Timothy’s free
will that the apostle appealed, when he exhorted him in these words:
“Keep thyself continent”? <span id="fr_2997"></span>[2998](#fn_2997.md) He
also explained the power of the will in this matter when He said,
“Having no necessity, but possessing power over his own will, to keep
his virgin.” <span id="fr_2998"></span>[2999](#fn_2998.md) And yet “all men
do not receive this saying, except those to whom the power is given.”
Now they to whom this is not given either are unwilling or do not fulfil
what they will; whereas they to whom it is given so will as to
accomplish what they will. In order, therefore, that this saying, which
is not received by all men, may yet be received by some, there are both
the gift of God and free will.
