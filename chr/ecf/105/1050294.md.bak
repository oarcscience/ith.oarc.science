<span id="xii.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47 \[XL.\]—For What Pelagius Thought
that Christ is Necessary to Us.</span>

<span id="xii.li-p2"></span>Perhaps, however, he thinks the name of
Christ to be necessary on this account, that by His gospel we may learn
how we ought to live; but not that we may be also assisted by His grace,
in order withal to lead good lives. Well, even this consideration should
lead him at least to confess that there is a miserable darkness in the
human mind, which knows how it ought to tame a lion, but knows not how
to live. To know this, too, is it enough for us to have free will and
natural law? This is that wisdom of word, whereby “the cross of Christ
is rendered of none effect.” <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md)
He, however, who said, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,” <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) since that cross cannot be made of
none effect, in very deed overthrows that wisdom by the foolishness of
preaching whereby believers are healed. For if natural capacity, by help
of free will, is in itself sufficient both for discovering how one ought
to live, and also for leading a holy life, then “Christ died in
vain,” <span id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245.md) and therefore also
“the offence of the cross is ceased.” <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) Why also may I not myself
exclaim?—nay, I will exclaim, and chide them with a Christian’s
sorrow,—“Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
justified by nature; ye are fallen from grace;” <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md) for, “being ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and wishing to establish your own righteousness, you have
not submitted yourselves to the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248.md) For even as “Christ is the end of
the law,” so likewise is He the Saviour of man’s corrupted nature, “for
righteousness to every one that believeth.” <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md)
