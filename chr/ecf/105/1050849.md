<span id="xviii.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—He Suggests a Dilemma to
Cœlestius.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.vii-p2"></span>What was that which the same pope
replied to the bishops of Numidia concerning this very cause, because he
had received letters from both Councils, as well from the Council of
Carthage as from the Council of Mileve—does he not speak most plainly
concerning infants? For these are his words: <span
id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631.md) “For what your Fraternity <span
id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632.md) asserts that they preach, that
infants can be endowed with the rewards of eternal life even without the
grace of baptism, is excessively silly; for unless they shall eat the
flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, they shall not have life
in themselves. <span id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633.md) And they who
maintain this as being theirs without regeneration, appear to me to wish
to destroy baptism itself, since they proclaim that these have that
which we believe is not to be conferred on them without baptism.” What
does the ungrateful man say to this, when the Apostolic See had already
spared him on his profession, as if he were corrected by its most
benignant lenity? What does he say to this? Will infants after the end
of their life, even if while they live they are not baptized in Christ,
be in eternal life, or will they not? If he should say, “They will,” how
then did he answer that he had condemned what had been uttered under his
name “according to the judgment of Innocent, of blessed memory”? Lo,
Pope Innocent, of blessed memory, says that infants have not life
without Christ’s baptism, and without partaking of Christ’s body and
blood. If he should say, “They will not,” how then, if they do not
receive eternal life, are they certainly by consequence condemned in
eternal death if they derive no original sin?
