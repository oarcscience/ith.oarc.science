<span id="x.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[X.\]—Distinction Between Actual
and Original Sin. <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) </span>

<span id="x.iii.xi-p3"></span>Again, in the clause which follows, “In
which all have sinned,” how cautiously, rightly, and unambiguously is
the statement expressed! For if you understand that sin to be meant
which by one man entered into the world, “In which \[sin\] all have
sinned,” it is surely clear enough, that the sins which are peculiar to
every man, which they themselves commit and which belong simply to them,
mean one thing; and that the one sin, in and by which all have sinned,
means another thing; since all were that one man. If, however, it be not
the sin, but that one man that is understood, “In which \[one man\] all
have sinned,” what again can be plainer than even this clear statement?
We read, indeed, of those being justified in Christ who believe in Him,
by reason of the secret communion and inspiration of that spiritual
grace which makes every one who cleaves to the Lord “one spirit” with
Him, <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) although His saints also
imitate His example; can I find, however, any similar statement made of
those who have imitated His saints? Can any man be said to be justified
in Paul or in Peter, or in any one whatever of those excellent men whose
authority stands high among the people of God? We are no doubt said to
be blessed in Abraham, according to the passage in which it was said to
him, “In thee shall all nations be blessed” <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) —for Christ’s sake, who is his seed
according to the flesh; which is still more clearly expressed in the
parallel passage: “In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.” I do not
believe that any one can find it anywhere stated in the Holy Scriptures,
that a man has ever sinned or still sins “in the devil,” although all
wicked and impious men “imitate” him. The apostle, however, has declared
concerning the first man, that “in him all have sinned;” <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) and yet there is still a contest about
the propagation of sin, and men oppose to it I know not what nebulous
theory of “imitation.” <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md)

<span id="x.iii.xi-p7"></span> This was the Pelagian term, expressive of
their dogma that original sin stands in the following \[or “imitation”\]
of Adam, instead of being the fault and corruption of the nature of
every man who is naturally engendered of Adam’s offspring; which
doctrine is expressed by Augustin’s word, *propagatio*, “propagation.”
