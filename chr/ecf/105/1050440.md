<span id="xiv.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 55.—Pelagius’ Letter Discussed.</span>

<span id="xiv.lix-p2"></span>What, then, is the meaning of those
vaunting words of theirs in this epistle, wherein they boast of having
induced the fourteen bishops who sat in that trial to believe not merely
that a man has ability but that he has “facility” to abstain from
sinning, according to the position laid down in the “Chapters” of this
same Pelagius,—when, in the draft of the proceedings, notwithstanding
the frequent repetition of the general charge and full consideration
bestowed on it, this is nowhere found? How, indeed, can this word fail
to contradict the very defence and answer which Pelagius made; since the
Bishop John asserted that Pelagius put in this answer in his presence,
that “he wished it to be understood that the man who was willing to
labour and agonize for his salvation was able to avoid sin,” while
Pelagius himself, at this time engaged in a formal inquiry and
conducting his defence, <span id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md) said,
that “it was by his own labour and the grace of God that a man is able
to be without sin?” Now, is a thing easy when labour is required to
effect it? For I suppose that every man would agree with us in the
opinion, that wherever there is labour there <span id="page_207">p.
207</span> <span id="xiv.lix-Page_207"></span>cannot be facility. And
yet a carnal epistle of windiness and inflation flies forth, and,
outrunning in speed the tardy record of the proceedings, gets first into
men’s hands; so as to assert that fourteen bishops in the East have
determined, not only “that a man is able to be without sin, and to keep
God’s commandments,” but “*easily* to keep.” Nor is God’s assistance
once named: it is merely said, “If he wishes;” so that, of course, as
nothing is affirmed of the divine grace, for which the earnest fight was
made, it remains that the only thing one reads of in this epistle is the
unhappy and self-deceiving—because represented as victorious—human
pride. As if the Bishop John, indeed, had not expressly declared that he
censured this statement, and that, by the help of three inspired texts
of Scripture, <span id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755.md) he had, as if
by thunderbolts, struck to the ground the gigantic mountains of such
presumption which they had piled up against the still over-towering
heights of heavenly grace; or as if again those other bishops who were
John’s assessors could have borne with Pelagius, either in mind or even
in ear, when he pronounced these words: “We said that a man is able to
be without sin and to keep the commandments of God, if he wishes,”
unless he had gone on at once to say: “For the ability to do this God
has given to him” (for they were unaware that he was speaking of nature,
and not of that grace which they had learnt from the teaching of the
apostle); and had afterwards added this qualification: “We never said,
however, that any man could be found, who at no time whatever from his
infancy to his old age had committed sin, but that if any person were
converted from his sins, he could by his own exertion and the grace of
God be without sin.” Now, by the very fact that in their sentence they
used these words, “he has answered correctly, ‘that a man can, when he
has the assistance and grace of God, be without sin;’” what else did
they fear than that, if he denied this, he would be doing a manifest
wrong not to man’s ability, but to God’s grace? It has indeed not been
defined when a man may become without sin; it has only been judicially
settled, that this result can only be reached by the assisting grace of
God; it has not, I say, been defined whether a man, whilst he is in this
flesh which lusts against the Spirit, ever has been, or now is, or ever
can be, by his present use of reason and free will, either in the full
society of man or in monastic solitude, in such a state as to be beyond
the necessity of offering up the prayer, not in behalf of others, but
for himself personally: “Forgive us our debts;” <span
id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756.md) or whether this gift shall be
consummated at the time when “we shall be like Him, when we shall see
Him as He is,” <span id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757.md) —when it shall
be said, not by those that are fighting: “I see another law in my
members, warring against the law of my mind,” <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758.md) but by those that are triumphing:
“O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?” <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759.md) Now, this is perhaps hardly a
question which ought to be discussed between catholics and heretics, but
only among catholics with a view to a peaceful settlement. <span
