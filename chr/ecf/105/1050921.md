<span id="xviii.vi.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Cyprian’s Orthodoxy
Undoubted.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>Let the Pelagians say, if they
dare, that this man of God was perverted by the error of the Manicheans,
in so praising the saints as yet to confess that no one in this life had
attained to such a perfection of righteousness as to have no sin at all,
confirming his judgment by the clear truth and divine authority of the
canonical testimonies. For does he deny that in baptism all sins are
forgiven, because he confesses that there remain frailty and infirmity,
whence he says that we sin after baptism and even to the end of this
life, having unceasing conflict with the vices of the flesh? Or did he
not remember what the apostle said about the Church without spot, that
he prescribed that no one ought so to flatter himself in respect of a
pure and spotless heart as to trust in his own innocence, and think that
no medicine needed to be applied to his wounds? I think that these new
heretics may concede to this catholic man that he knew “that the Holy
Spirit even in the old times aided good dispositions;” nay, even, what
they themselves will not allow, that they could not have possessed good
dispositions except through the Holy Spirit. I think that Cyprian knew
that all the prophets and apostles or saints of any kind soever who
pleased the Lord at any time were righteous—“not in comparison with the
wicked,” as they falsely assert that we say, “but by the rule of
virtue,” as they boast that they say; although Cyprian says,
nevertheless, no one can be without sin, and whoever should assert that
he is blameless is either proud or a fool. Nor is it with reference to
anything else that he understands the Scripture, “Who shall boast that
he has a pure heart? or who shall boast that he is pure from
sins?” <span id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876.md) I think that Cyprian
would not have needed to be taught by such as these, what he very well
knew, “that, in the time to come, there would be a reward of good works
and a punishment of evil works, but that no one could then perform the
commands which here he might have despised;” and yet he does not
understand and assert the Apostle Paul, who was assuredly not a
contemner of the divine commands, to have said, “To me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain,”  <span id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877.md)
on any other account, except that he reckoned it the greatest gain after
this life no longer to be held in worldly entanglements, no longer to be
obnoxious to the sins and vices of the flesh. Therefore the most blessed
Cyprian felt, and in the truth of the divine Scriptures saw, that even
the life of the apostles themselves, however good, holy, and righteous,
suffered some involvements of worldly entanglements, was obnoxious to
some sins and vices of the flesh; and that they desired death that they
might be free from those evils, and that they might attain to that
perfect righteousness which would not suffer such things, and which
would no more have to be achieved in the way of command merely, but to
be received in the way of reward. For not even when that shall have come
for which we pray when we say, “Thy kingdom come,” will there be in that
kingdom of God no righteousness; since the apostle says, “The kingdom of
God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the
Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878.md) Certainly these
three things are commanded among other divine precepts. Here
righteousness is prescribed to us when it is said, “Do
righteousness;” <span id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879.md) peace is
prescribed when it is said, “Have peace among yourselves;” <span
id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880.md) joy is prescribed when it is said,
“Rejoice in the Lord always.” <span id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881.md)
Let, then, the Pelagians deny that these things shall be in the kingdom
of God, where we shall live without end; or let them be so mad, if it
appears good, as to contend that righteousness, peace, and joy, will be
such there as they are here to the righteous. But if they both shall be,
and yet shall not be the same, assuredly here, in respect of the
commandment of them, the doing is to be cared for,—there the perfection
is to be hoped for in the way of reward; when, not being withheld by any
earthly entanglements, and being liable to no sins and vices of the
flesh (on account of which the apostle, as Cyprian received this
testimony, said that to die would be to him gain), we may perfectly love
God, the contemplation of whom will be face to face; we may also
perfectly love our neighbour, since, when the thoughts of the heart are
made manifest, no suspicion of any evil can disturb any one concerning
any one.
