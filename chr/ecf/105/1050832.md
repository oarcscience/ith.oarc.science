<span id="xviii.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—The Shame of
Nakedness.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span>This kind of shame—this necessity
of blushing—is certainly born with every man, and in some measure is
commanded by the very laws of nature; so that, in this matter, even
virtuous married people are ashamed. Nor can any one go to such an
extreme of evil and disgrace, as, because he knows God to be the author
of nature and the ordainer of marriage, to have intercourse even with
his wife in any one’s sight, or not to blush at those impulses and seek
secrecy, where he can shun the sight not only of strangers, but even of
all his own relatives. Therefore let human nature be permitted to
acknowledge the evil that happens to it by its own fault, lest it should
be compelled either not to blush at its own impulses, which is most
shameless, or else to blush at the work of its Creator, which is most
ungrateful. Of this evil, nevertheless, virtuous marriage makes good use
for the sake of the benefit of the begetting of children. But to consent
to lust for the sake of carnal pleasure alone is sin, although it may be
conceded to married people with permission.
