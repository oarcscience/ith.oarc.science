<span id="xix.iv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31 \[XV.\]—Free Will Has Its
Function in the Heart’s Conversion; But Grace Too Has Its.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxxi-p2"></span>Lest, however, it should be thought
that men themselves in this matter do nothing by free will, it is said
in the Psalm, “Harden not your hearts;” <span
id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) and in Ezekiel himself, “Cast away
from you all your transgressions, which ye have impiously committed
against me; and make you a new heart and a new spirit; and keep all my
commandments. For why will ye die, O house of Israel, saith the Lord?
for I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord
God: and turn ye, and live.” <span id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md)
We should remember that it is He who says, “Turn ye and live,” to whom
it is said in prayer, “Turn us again, O God.” <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) We should remember that He says,
“Cast away from you all your transgressions,” when it is even He who
justifies the ungodly. We should remember that He says, “Make you a new
heart and a new spirit,” who also promises, “I will give you a new
heart, and a new spirit will I put within you.” <span
id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md) How is it, then, that He who says,
“Make you,” also says, “I will give you”? Why does He command, if He is
to give? Why does He give if man is to make, except it be that He gives
what He commands when He helps him to obey whom He commands? There is,
however, always within us a free will,—but it is not always good; for it
is either free from righteousness when it serves sin,—and then it is
evil,—or else it is free from sin when it serves righteousness,—and then
it is good. But the grace of God is always good; and by it it comes to
pass that a man is of a good will, though he was before of an evil one.
By it also it comes to pass that the very good will, which has now begun
to be, is enlarged, and made so great that it is able to fulfil the
divine commandments which it shall wish, when it shall once firmly and
perfectly wish. This is the purport of what the Scripture says: “If thou
wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments;” <span
id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md) so that the man who wills but is
not able knows that he does not yet fully will, and prays that he may
<span id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span
id="xix.iv.xxxi-Page_457"></span>have so great a will that it may
suffice for keeping the commandments. And thus, indeed, he receives
assistance to perform what he is commanded. Then is the will of use when
we have ability; just as ability is also then of use when we have the
will. For what does it profit us if we will what we are unable to do, or
else do not will what we are able to do?
