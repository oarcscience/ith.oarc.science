<span id="iv-p1"></span><span class="c25"><span
id="iv-p1.1"></span>Preface to the American Edition.</span>

<span id="iv-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="iv-p3"></span>“<span class="c16"><span
id="iv-p3.1"></span>This</span> volume contains all the Anti-Pelagian
writings of Augustin, collected by the Benedictine editors in their
tenth volume, with the exception only of the two long works *Against
Julian*, and *The Unfinished Work*, which have been necessarily excluded
on account of their bulk. The translation here printed is that of the
English version of Augustin’s works, published by Messrs. T. and T.
Clark at Edinburgh. This translation has been carefully compared with
the Latin throughout, and corrected on every page into more accurate
conformity to its sense. But this has not so altered its character that
it ceases to be the Edinburgh translation,—bettered somewhat, but still
essentially the same. The excellent translation of the three treatises,
*On the Spirit and the Letter, On Nature and Grace*, and *On the
Proceedings of Pelagius*, published in the early summer of this year by
two Oxford scholars, Messrs. Woods and Johnston (London: David Nutt),
was unfortunately too late in reaching America to be of any service to
the editor.

<span id="iv-p4"></span>“What may be called the explanatory matter of
the Edinburgh translation, has been treated here even more freely than
the text. The headings to the chapters have been added to until nearly
every chapter is now provided with a caption. The brackets which
distinguished the notes added by the translator from those which he
translated from the Benedictine editor, have been generally removed, and
the notes themselves often verbally changed, or otherwise altered. A few
notes have been added,—chiefly with the design of rendering the
allusions in the text intelligible to the uninstructed reader; and the
more lengthy of these have been enclosed in brackets, and signed with a
W. The result of all this is, that it is unsafe to hold the Edinburgh
translators too closely responsible for the unbracketed matter; but that
the American editor has not claimed as his own more than is really his.

<span id="iv-p5"></span>“In preparing an *Introductory Essay* for the
volume, two objects have been kept in view: to place the necessary
Prolegomena to the following treatises in the hands of the reader, and
to furnish the English reader with some illustrations of the
Anti-Pelagian treatises from the other writings of Augustin. In the
former interest, a brief sketch of the history of the Pelagian
controversy and of the Pelagian and Augustinian systems has been given,
and the occasions, objects, and contents of the several treatises have
been briefly stated. In the latter, Augustin’s letters and sermons have
been as copiously extracted as the limits of space allowed. In the
nature of the case, the sources have been independently examined for
these materials; but those who have written of Pelagianism and of
Augustin’s part in the controversy with it, have not been neglected.
Above others, probably special obligations ought to be acknowledged to
the Benedictine preface to their tenth volume, and to Canon Bright’s
Introduction to his edition of *Select Anti-Pelagian Treatises*. The
purpose of this essay will be subserved if it enables the <span
id="page_x">p. x</span> <span id="iv-Page_x"></span>reader to attack the
treatises themselves with increased interest and readiness to assimilate
and estimate their contents.

<span id="iv-p6"></span>“References to the treatises in the essay, and
cross-references in the treatises themselves, have been inserted
wherever they seemed absolutely necessary; but they have been often
omitted where otherwise they would have been inserted because it has
been thought that the *Index of Subjects* will suffice for all the needs
of comparison of passages that are likely to arise. In the *Index of
Texts*, an asterisk marks some of those places where a text is fully
explained; and students of the history of Biblical Interpretation may
find this feature helpful to them. It will not be strange, if, on
turning up a few passages, they will find their notion of the power,
exactness, and devout truth of Augustin as an interpreter of Scripture
very much raised above what the current histories of interpretation have
taught them.”

<span id="iv-p7"></span>The above has been prepared by Dr. Warfield. I
need only add that the present volume contains the most important of the
doctrinal and polemical works of Augustin, which exerted a powerful
influence upon the Reformers of the sixteenth century and upon the
Jansenists in the seventeenth. They constitute what is popularly called
the Augustinian system, though they only represent one side of it.
Enough has been said on their merits in the Prolegomena to the first
volume, and in the valuable Introductory Essay of Dr. <span
class="c16"><span id="iv-p7.1"></span>Warfield</span>, who has been
called to fill the chair of systematic theology once adorned by the
learning and piety of the immortal <span class="c16"><span
id="iv-p7.2"></span>Hodges</span>, father and son.

<span id="iv-p8"></span>The remaining three volumes will contain the
exegetical writings of the great Bishop of Hippo.
