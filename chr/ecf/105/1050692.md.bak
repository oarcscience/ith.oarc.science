id="xvii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Other Ways of Taking the
Passage.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xx-p2"></span>There are also some persons who
understand the prophet’s words, “He gave breath to the people upon it,”
that is to say, upon the earth, as if the word “breath,” *flatus*, were
simply equivalent to “soul,” *anima*; while they construe the next
clause, “and spirit to them that walk over it,” as referring to the Holy
Ghost; and they suppose that the same order is observed by the prophet
that is mentioned by the apostle: “That was not first which is
spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is
spiritual.” <span id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) Now from this
view of the prophet’s words an elegant interpretation may, no doubt,
<span id="page_324">p. 324</span> <span
id="xvii.iv.xx-Page_324"></span>be formed consistent with the apostle’s
sense. The phrase, “to them that walk over it,” is in the Latin,
“*calcantibus eam*;” and as the literal meaning of these words is
“treading upon it,” we may understand the idea of contempt of it to be
implied. For they who receive the Holy Ghost despise earthly things in
their love of heavenly things. None of these opinions, however, is
contrary to the faith, whether one regards the two terms, *breath* and
*spirit*, to pertain to human nature, or both of them to the Holy Ghost,
or one of them, *breath*, to the soul, and the other, *spirit*, to the
Holy Ghost. If, however, the soul and spirit of the human being be the
meaning here, since undoubtedly it ought to be, as the gift of God to
him, then we must further inquire, in what way does God bestow this
gift? Is it by propagation, as He gives us our bodily limbs by this
process? Or is it bestowed on each person severally by God’s
inbreathing, not by propagation, but as always a fresh creation? These
questions are not ambiguous, as this man would make them; but we wish
that they be defended by the most certain warrant of the divine
Scriptures.
