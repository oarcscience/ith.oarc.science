id="xx.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[IV.\]—Objections to the Use of
Rebuke.</span>

<span id="xx.ix-p2"></span>“How,” says he, <span
id="fr_3257"></span>[3258](#fn_3257.md) “is it my fault that I have not
what I have not received from Him, when unless it is given by Him, there
is no other at all whence such and so great a gift can be had?” Suffer
me a little, my brethren, not as against you whose heart is right with
God, but as against those who mind earthly things, or as against those
human modes of thinking themselves, to contend for the truth, of the
heavenly and divine grace. For they who say this are such as in their
wicked works are unwilling to be rebuked by those who proclaim this
grace. “Prescribe to me what I shall do, and if I should do it, give
thanks to God for me who has given me to do it; but if I do it not, I
must not be rebuked, but He must be besought to give what He has not
given; that is, that very believing love of God and of my neighbour by
which His precepts are <span id="fr_3258"></span>[3259](#fn_3258.md)
observed. Pray, then, for me that I may receive this, and may by its
means do freely and with good will that which He commands. But I should
be justly rebuked if by my own fault I had it not; that is, if I myself
could give it to myself, or could receive it, and did not do so, or if
He should give it and I should be unwilling to receive it. But since
even the will itself is prepared <span
id="fr_3259"></span>[3260](#fn_3259.md) by the Lord, why dust thou rebuke
me because thou seeest me unwilling to do His precepts, and dust not
rather ask Him Himself to work in me the will also?”
