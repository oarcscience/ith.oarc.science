<span id="xvi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c7"><span
id="xvi.iv-p1.1"></span>A Letter <span
id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) Addressed to the Count
Valerius,</span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="xvi.iv-p3.1"></span>on augustin’s forwarding to him what he calls
his first book “on marriage and concupiscence.”</span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p4"></span>————————————

<span id="xvi.iv-p5"></span>To the illustrious and deservedly eminent
Lord and his most dearly beloved son in the love of Christ, Valerius,
Augustin sends greeting in the Lord.

<span id="xvi.iv-p6"></span>1. <span class="c16"><span
id="xvi.iv-p6.1"></span>While</span> I was chafing at the long
disappointment of receiving no acknowledgments from your Highness of the
many letters which I had written to you, I all at once received three
letters from your Grace,—one by the hand of my fellow bishop
Vindemialis, which was not meant for me only, and two, soon afterwards,
through my brother presbyter Firmus. This holy man, who is bound to me,
as you may have ascertained from his own lips, by the ties of a most
intimate love, had much conversation with me about your excellence, and
gave me undoubted proofs of his complete knowledge of your character “in
the bowels of Christ;” <span id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md) by
these means he had sight, not only of the letters of which the
fore-mentioned bishop and he himself had been the bearers, but also of
those which we expressed our disappointment at not having received. Now
his information respecting you was all the more pleasant to us, inasmuch
as he gave me to understand, what it was out of your power to do, that
you would not, even at my earnest request for an answer, become the
extoller of your own praises, contrary to the permission of Holy
Scripture. <span id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) But I ought myself
to hesitate to write to you in this strain, lest I should incur the
suspicion of flattering you, my illustrious and deservedly eminent lord
and dearly beloved son in the love of Christ.

<span id="xvi.iv-p9"></span>2. Now, as to your praises in Christ, or
rather Christ’s praises in you, see what delight and joy it was to me to
hear of them from him, who could neither deceive me because of his
fidelity to me, nor be ignorant of them by reason of his friendship with
you. But other testimony, which though inferior in amount and certainty
has still reached my ear from divers quarters, assures me how sound and
catholic is your faith; how devout your hope of the future; how great
your love to God and the brethren; how humble your mind amid the highest
honours, as you do not trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God,
and art rich in good works; <span id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md)
how your house is a rest and comfort of the saints, and a terror to
evil-doers; how great is your care that no man lay snares for Christ’s
members (either among His old enemies or those of more recent days),
although he use Christ’s name as a cloak for his wiles; and at the same
time, though you give no quarter to the error of these enemies, how
provident you are to secure their salvation. This and the like, we
frequently hear, as I have already said, even from others; but at the
present moment we have, by means of the above-mentioned brother,
received a fuller and more trustworthy knowledge.

<span id="xvi.iv-p11"></span>3. Touching, however, the subject of
conjugal purity, that we might be able to bestow our commendation and
love upon you for it, could we possibly listen to the information of any
one but some bosom friend of your own, who had no mere superficial
acquaintance with you, but knew your innermost life? Concerning,
therefore, this excellent gift of God to you, I am delighted to converse
with you with more frankness and at greater length. I am quite sure that
I shall not prove burdensome to you, even if I send you a prolix
treatise, the perusal of which will only ensure a longer converse
between us. For this have I discovered, that amidst your manifold and
weighty cares you pursue your reading with ease and pleasure; and that
you take great delight in any little performances of ours, even if they
are addressed to other persons, whenever they have chanced to fall into
your hands. Whatever, therefore, is addressed to *yourself*, in which I
can speak to you as it were personally, you will deign both to notice
with greater attention, and to receive with a higher pleasure. From the
perusal, then, of this letter, turn to the book which I send with it. It
will in its very commencement, in a more convenient manner, intimate to
your Reverence the reason, both why it has been written, and why it has
been submitted specially to your consideration.
