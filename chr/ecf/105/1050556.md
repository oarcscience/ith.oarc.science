<span id="xv.iv.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45.—Man’s Deliverance Suited to the
Character of His Captivity.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xlv-p2"></span>The guilt, therefore, of that corruption
of which we are speaking will remain in the carnal offspring of the
regenerate, until in them also it be washed away in the laver of
regeneration. A regenerate man does not regenerate, but generates, sons
according to the flesh; and thus he transmits to his posterity, not the
condition of the regenerated, but only of the generated. Therefore, be a
man guilty of unbelief, or a perfect believer, he does not in either
case beget faithful children, but sinners; in the same way that the
seeds, not only of a wild olive, but also of a cultivated one, produce
not cultivated olives, but wild ones. So, likewise, his first birth
holds a man in that bondage from which nothing but his second birth
delivers him. The devil holds him, Christ liberates him: Eve’s deceiver
holds him, Mary’s Son frees him: he holds him, who approached the man
through the woman; He frees him, who was born of a woman that never
approached a man: he holds him, who injected into the woman the cause of
lust; He liberates him, who without any lust was conceived in the woman.
The former was able to hold all men in his grasp through one; nor does
any deliver them out of his power but One, whom he was unable to grasp.
The very sacraments indeed of the Church, which she <span
id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) administers with due ceremony,
according to the authority of very ancient tradition (so that these men,
notwithstanding their opinion that the sacraments are imitatively rather
than really used in the case of infants, still do not venture <span
id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span id="xv.iv.xlv-Page_253"></span>to
reject them with open disapproval),—the very sacraments, I say, of the
holy Church show plainly enough that infants, even when fresh from the
womb, are delivered from the bondage of the devil through the grace of
Christ. For, to say nothing of the fact that they are baptized for the
remission of sins by no fallacious, but by a true and faithful mystery,
there is previously wrought on them the exorcism and the exsufflation of
the hostile power, which they profess to renounce by the mouth of those
who bring them to baptism. Now, by all these consecrated and evident
signs of hidden realities, they are shown to pass from their worst
oppressor to their most excellent Redeemer, who, by taking on Himself
our infirmity in our behalf, has bound the strong man, that He may spoil
his goods; <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) seeing that the
weakness of God is stronger, not only than men, but also than angels.
While, therefore, God delivers small as well as great, He shows in both
instances that the apostle spoke under the direction of the Truth. For
it is not merely adults, but little babes too whom He rescues from the
power of darkness, in order to transfer them to the kingdom of God’s
dear Son. <span id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md)

“the Pelagians” to be the subject of the proposition.
