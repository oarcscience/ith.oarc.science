<span id="xxi.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[III.\]—Augustin Confesses that
He Had Formerly Been in Error Concerning the Grace of God.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.vii-p2"></span>It was not thus that that pious and
humble teacher thought—I speak of the most blessed Cyprian—when he said
“that we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.” <span
id="fr_3431"></span>[3432](#fn_3431.md) And in order to show this, he
appealed to the apostle as a witness, where he said, “For what hast thou
that thou hast not received? And if thou hast received it, why boastest
thou as if thou hadst not received it?” <span
id="fr_3432"></span>[3433](#fn_3432.md) And it was chiefly by this
testimony that I myself also was convinced when I was in a similar
error, thinking that faith whereby we believe on God is not God’s gift,
but that it is in us from ourselves, and that by it we obtain the gifts
of God, whereby we may live temperately and righteously and piously in
this world. For I did not think that faith was preceded by God’s grace,
so that by its means would be given to us what we might profitably ask,
except that we could not believe if the proclamation of the truth did
not precede; but that we should consent when the gospel was preached to
us I thought was our own doing, and came to us from ourselves. And this
my error is sufficiently indicated in some small works of mine written
before my episcopate. Among these is that which you have mentioned in
your letters <span id="fr_3433"></span>[3434](#fn_3433.md) wherein is an
exposition of certain propositions from the Epistle to the Romans.
Eventually, when I was retracting all my small works, and was committing
that retractation to writing, of which task I had already completed two
books before I had taken up your more lengthy letters,—when in the first
volume I had reached the retractation of this book, I then spoke
thus:—“Also discussing, I say, ‘what God could have chosen in him who
was as yet unborn, whom He said that the elder should serve; and what in
the same elder, equally as yet unborn, He could have rejected;
concerning whom, on this account, the prophetic testimony is recorded,
although declared long subsequently, “Jacob have I loved, and Esau have
I hated,”’ <span id="fr_3434"></span>[3435](#fn_3434.md) I carried out my
reasoning to the point of saying: ‘God did not therefore choose the
works of any one in foreknowledge of what He Himself would <span
id="page_501">p. 501</span> <span id="xxi.ii.vii-Page_501"></span>give
them, but he chose the faith, in the foreknowledge that He would choose
that very person whom He foreknew would believe on Him,—to whom He would
give the Holy Spirit, so that by doing good works he might obtain
eternal life also.’ I had not yet very carefully sought, nor had I as
yet found, what is the nature of the election of grace, of which the
apostle says, ‘A remnant are saved according to the election of
grace.’ <span id="fr_3435"></span>[3436](#fn_3435.md) Which assuredly is
not grace if any merits precede it; lest what is now given, not
according to grace, but according to debt, be rather paid to merits than
freely given. And what I next subjoined: ‘For the same apostle says,
“The same God which worketh all in all;” <span
id="fr_3436"></span>[3437](#fn_3436.md) but it was never said, God
believeth all in all;’ and then added, ‘Therefore what we believe is our
own, but what good thing we do is of Him who giveth the Holy Spirit to
them that believe:’ I certainly could not have said, had I already known
that faith itself also is found among those gifts of God which are given
by the same Spirit. Both, therefore, are ours on account of the choice
of the will, and yet both are given by the spirit of faith and love. For
faith is not alone but as it is written, ‘Love with faith, from God the
Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.’ <span
id="fr_3437"></span>[3438](#fn_3437.md) And what I said a little after,
‘For it is ours to believe and to will, but it is His to give to those
who believe and will, the power of doing good works through the Holy
Spirit, by whom love is shed abroad in our hearts,’—is true indeed; but
by the same rule both are also God’s, because God prepares the will; and
both are ours too, because they are only brought about with our good
wills. And thus what I subsequently said also: ‘Because we are not able
to will unless we are called; and when, after our calling, we would
will, our willing is not sufficiently nor our running, unless God gives
strength to us that run, and leads us whither He calls us;’ and
thereupon added: ‘It is plain, therefore, that it is not of him that
willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy, that we
do good works’—this is absolutely most true. But I discovered little
concerning the calling itself, which is according to God’s purpose; for
not such is the calling of all that are called, but only of the elect.
Therefore what I said a little afterwards: ‘For as in those whom God
elects it is not works but faith that begins the merit so as to do good
works by the gift of God, so in those whom He condemns, unbelief and
impiety begin the merit of punishment, so that even by way of punishment
itself they do evil works’—I spoke most truly. But that even the merit
itself of faith was God’s gift, I neither thought of inquiring into, nor
did I say. And in another place I say: ‘For whom He has mercy upon, He
makes to do good works, and whom He hardeneth He leaves to do evil
works; but that mercy is bestowed upon the preceding merit of faith, and
that hardening is applied to preceding iniquity.’ And this indeed is
true; but it should further have been asked, whether even the merit of
faith does not come from God’s mercy,—that is, whether that mercy is
manifested in man only because he is a believer, or whether it is also
manifested that he may be a believer? For we read in the apostle’s
words: ‘I obtained mercy to be a believer.’ <span
id="fr_3438"></span>[3439](#fn_3438.md) He does not say, ‘Because I was a
believer.’ Therefore although it is given to the believer, yet it has
been given also that he may be a believer. Therefore also, in another
place in the same book I most truly said: ‘Because, if it is of God’s
mercy, and not of works, that we are even called that we may believe and
it is granted to us who believe to do good works, that mercy must not be
grudged to the heathen;’—although I there discoursed less carefully
about that calling which is given according to God’s purpose.” <span
