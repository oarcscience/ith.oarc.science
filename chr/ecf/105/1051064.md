<span id="xxi.ii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Cyprian’s Treatise “On the
Mortality.”</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxviii-p2"></span>But if any wish to be instructed in
the opinions of those who have handled the subject, it behoves them to
prefer to all commentators the book of Wisdom, where it is read, “He was
taken away, that wickedness should not alter his understanding;” because
illustrious commentators, even in the times nearest to the apostles,
preferred it to themselves, seeing that when they made use of it for a
testimony they believed that they were making use of nothing but a
divine testimony; and certainly it appears that the most blessed
Cyprian, in order to commend the advantage of an earlier death,
contended that those who end this life, wherein sin is possible, are
taken away from the risks of sins. In the same treatise, among other
things, he says, “Why, when you are about to be with Christ, and are
secure of the divine promise, do you not embrace being called to Christ,
and rejoice that you are free from the devil?” <span
id="fr_3506"></span>[3507](#fn_3506.md) And in another place he says, “Boys
escape the peril of their unstable age.” <span
id="fr_3507"></span>[3508](#fn_3507.md) And again, in another place, he
says, “Why do we not hasten and run, that we may see our country, that
we may hail our relatives? A great number of those who are dear to us
are expecting us there,—a dense and abundant crowd of parents, brethren,
sons, are longing for us; already secure of their own safety, but still
anxious about our salvation.” <span id="fr_3508"></span>[3509](#fn_3508.md)
By these and such like sentiments, that teacher sufficiently and plainly
testifies, in the clearest <span id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.xxviii-Page_512"></span>light of the catholic faith, that
perils of sin and trials are to be feared even until the putting off of
this body, but that afterwards no one shall suffer any such things. And
even if he did not testify thus, when could any manner of Christian be
in doubt on this matter? How, then, should it not have been of advantage
to a man who has lapsed, and who finishes his life wretchedly in that
same state of lapse, and passes into the punishment due to such as
he,—how, I say, should it not have been of the greatest and highest
advantage to such an one to be snatched by death from this sphere of
temptations before his fall?
