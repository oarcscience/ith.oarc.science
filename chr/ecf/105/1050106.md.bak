<span id="x.iv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[XII.\]—No One Righteous in All
Things. <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) </span>

<span id="x.iv.xvii-p3"></span>That illustrious testimony of God,
therefore, in which Job is commended, is not contrary to the passage in
which it is said, “In Thy sight shall no man living be justified;” <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) for it does not lead us to suppose
that in him there was nothing at all which might either by himself truly
or by the Lord God rightly be blamed, although at the same time he might
with no untruth be said to be a righteous man, and a sincere worshipper
of God, and one who keeps himself from every evil work. For these are
God’s words concerning him: “Hast thou diligently considered my servant
Job? For there is none like him on the earth, blameless, righteous, a
true worshipper of God, who keeps himself from every evil work.” <span
id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) First, he is here praised for his
excellence in comparison with all men on earth. He therefore excelled
all who were at that time able to be righteous upon earth; and yet,
because of this superiority over others in righteousness, he was not
therefore altogether without sin. He is next said to be “*blameless*”—no
one could fairly bring an accusation against him in respect of his life;
“*righteous*”—he had advanced so greatly in moral probity, that no man
could be mentioned on a par with him; “*a true worshipper of
God*”—because he was a sincere and humble confessor of his own sins;
“*who keeps himself from every evil work*”—it would have been wonderful
if this had extended to every evil word and thought. How great a man
indeed Job was, we are not told; but we know that he was a just man; we
know, too, that in the endurance of terrible afflictions and trials he
was great; and we know that it was not on account of his sins, but for
the purpose of demonstrating his righteousness, that he had to bear so
much suffering. But the language in which the Lord commends Job might
also be applied to him who “delights in the law of God after the inner
man, whilst he sees another law in his members warring against the law
of his mind;” <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) especially as he
says, “The good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not,
that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it,
but sin that dwelleth in me.” <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md)
Observe how he too after the inward man is separate from every evil
work, because such work he does not himself effect, but the evil which
dwells in his flesh; and yet, since he does not have even that ability
to delight in the law of God except from the grace of God, he, as still
in want of deliverance, exclaims, “O wretched man that I am! who shall
deliver me from the body of this death? God’s grace, through Jesus
Christ our Lord!” <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md)
