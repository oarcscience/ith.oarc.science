<span id="xx.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—No One is Certain and Secure of
His Own Predestination and Salvation.</span>

<span id="xx.xliii-p2"></span>But, moreover, that such things as these
are so spoken to saints who will persevere, as if it were reckoned
uncertain whether they will persevere, is a reason that they ought not
otherwise to hear these things, since it is well for them “not to be
high-minded, but to fear.” <span id="fr_3377"></span>[3378](#fn_3377.md)
For who of the multitude of believers can presume, so long as he is
living in this mortal state, that he is in the number of the
predestinated? Because it is necessary that in this condition that
should be kept hidden; since here we have to beware so much of pride,
that even so great an apostle was buffetted by a messenger of Satan,
lest he should be lifted up. <span id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378.md)
Hence it was said to the apostles, “If ye abide in me;” <span
id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379.md) and this He said who knew for a
certainty that they would abide; and through the prophet, “If ye shall
be willing, and will hear me,” <span
id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380.md) although He knew in whom He would
work to will also. And many similar things are said. For on account of
the usefulness of this secrecy, lest, perchance, any one should be
lifted up, but that all, even although they are running well, should
fear, in that it is not known who may attain,—on account of the
usefulness of this secrecy, it must be believed that some of the
children of perdition, who have not received the gift of perseverance to
the end, begin to live in the faith which worketh by love, and live for
some time faithfully and righteously, and afterwards fall away, and are
not taken away from this life before this happens to them. If this had
happened to none of these, men would have that very wholesome fear, by
which the sin of presumption is kept down, only so long as until they
should attain to the grace of Christ by which to live piously, and
afterwards would for time to come be secure that they would never fall
away from Him. And such presumption in this condition of trials is not
fitting, where there is so great weakness, that security may engender
pride. Finally, this also shall be the case; but it shall be at that
time, in men also as it already is in the angels, when there cannot be
any pride. Therefore the number of the saints, by God’s grace
predestinated to God’s kingdom, with the gift of perseverance to the end
bestowed on them, shall be guided thither in its completeness, and there
shall be at length without end preserved in its fullest completeness,
most blessed, the mercy of their Saviour still cleaving to them, whether
in their conversion, in their conflict, or in their crown!
