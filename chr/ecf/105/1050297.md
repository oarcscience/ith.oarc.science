<span id="xii.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50 \[XLIII.\]—God Commands No
Impossibilities.</span>

<span id="xii.liv-p2"></span>What he says, however, is true enough,
“that God is as good as just, and made man such that he was quite able
to live without the evil of sin, if only he had been willing.” For who
does not know that man was made whole and faultless, and endowed with a
free will and a free ability to lead a holy life? Our present inquiry,
however, is about the man whom “the thieves” <span
id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) left half dead on the road, and
who, being disabled and pierced through with heavy wounds, is not so
able to mount up to the heights of righteousness as he was able to
descend therefrom; who, moreover, if he is now in “the inn,” <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md) is in process of cure. God
therefore does not command impossibilities; but in His command He
counsels you both to do what you can for yourself, and to ask His aid in
what you cannot do. Now, we should see whence comes the possibility, and
whence the impossibility. This man says: “That proceeds not from a man’s
will which he can do by nature.” I say: A man is not righteous by his
will if he can be by nature. He will, however, be able to accomplish by
remedial aid what he is rendered incapable of doing by his flaw.
