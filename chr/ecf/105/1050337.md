<span id="xiii.v-p2"></span>I. “First of all,” says he, “he must be
asked who denies man’s ability to live without sin, what every sort of
sin is,—is it such as can be avoided? or is it unavoidable? If it is
unavoidable, then it is not sin; if it can be avoided, then a man can
live without the sin which can be avoided. No reason or justice permits
us to designate as sin what cannot in any way be avoided.” Our answer to
this is, that sin can be avoided, if our corrupted nature be healed by
God’s grace, through our Lord Jesus Christ. For, in so far as it is not
sound, in so far does it either through blindness fail to see, or
through weakness fail to accomplish, that which it ought to do; “for the
flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh,” <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366) so that a man does
not do the things which he would.
