<span id="xiii.iv-p4"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xiii.iv-p4.1"></span>Your</span> love, which in both of you is so
great and so holy that it is a delight to obey its commands, has laid me
under an obligation to reply to some definitions which are said to be
the work of Cœlestius; for so runs the title of the paper which you have
given me, “The definitions, so it is said, of Cœlestius.” As for this
title, I take it that it is not his, but theirs who have brought this
work from Sicily, where Cœlestius is said not to be,—although many
there <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363) make boastful
pretension of holding views like his, and, to use the apostle’s word,
“being themselves deceived, lead others also astray.” <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364) That these views are, however, his,
or those of some associates <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365)
of his, we, too, can well believe. For the above-mentioned brief
definitions, or rather propositions, are by no means at variance with
his opinion, such as I have seen it expressed in another work, of which
he is the undoubted author. There was therefore good reason, I <span
id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span id="xiii.iv-Page_160"></span>think,
for the report which those brethren, who brought these tidings to us,
heard in Sicily, that Cœlestius taught or wrote such opinions. I should
like, if it were possible, so to meet the obligation imposed on me by
your brotherly kindness, that I, too, in my own answer should be equally
brief. But unless I set forth also the propositions which I answer, who
will be able to form a judgment of the value of my answer? Still I will
try to the best of my ability, assisted, too, by God’s mercy, by your
own prayers, so to conduct the discussion as to keep it from running to
an unnecessary length.

<span id="xiii.iv-p5"></span> In his epistle (157) to Hilary, written a
little while before this work, he mentions Cœlestius and the
condemnation of his errors in a Council held at Carthage; he expresses
also some apprehension of Cœlestius attempting to spread his opinions in
Sicily: “Whether he be himself there,” says Augustin, “or only others
who are partners in his errors, there are too many of them; and, unless
they be checked, they lead astray others to join their sect; and so
great is their increase, that I cannot tell whither they will force
their way,” etc.

read *sectatorum* ejus,—not unsuitably (although not justified by <span

Cœlestius “had,” to use Jerome’s words, “by this time turned out a
master with a following,—the leader of a perfect army.”—*Jerome’s
Epistle to Ctesiphon*, written in the year 413 or 414.
