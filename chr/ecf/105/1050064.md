<span id="x.iii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46.—From the Epistle to the
Ephesians.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xlvi-p2"></span>To the Ephesians he addresses words of
the same import: “And you when ye were dead in trespasses and sins;
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit of him that
now worketh in the children of disobedience; among whom also we all had
our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the
desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of
wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love
wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us
together with Christ; by whose grace ye are saved.” <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361) Again, a little afterwards, he says:
“By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is
the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath
before ordained that we should walk in them.” <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362) And again, after a short interval: “At
that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of
Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and
without God in the world: but now, in Christ Jesus, ye who were
sometimes far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For He is our
peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of
partition between us; having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the
law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in Himself of
twain one new man, so making peace; and that He might reconcile both
unto God in one body by the cross, having in Himself slain the enmity;
and He came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them
that were nigh. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto
the Father.” <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363) Then in another
passage he thus writes: “As the truth is in Jesus: that ye put off,
concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt
according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your
mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness.” <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364) And again: “Grieve not the Holy Spirit
of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.” <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365)
