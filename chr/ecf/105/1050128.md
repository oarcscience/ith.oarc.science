id="x.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XXV.\]—An Objection of
Pelagians.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxxix-p2"></span>The answer, which we have already
given, <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601) to those who say, “If a
sinner has begotten a sinner, a righteous man ought also to have
begotten a righteous man,” we now advance in reply to such as argue that
one who is born of a baptized man ought himself to be regarded as
already baptized. “For why,” they ask, “could he not have been baptized
in the loins of his father, when, according to the Epistle to the
Hebrews, Levi, <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602) was able to pay
tithes in the loins of Abraham?” They who propose this argument ought to
observe that Levi did not on this account subsequently not pay tithes,
because he had paid tithes already in the loins of Abraham, but because
he was ordained to the office of the priesthood in order to receive
tithes, not to pay them; otherwise neither would his brethren, who all
contributed their tithes to him, have been tithed—because they too,
whilst in the loins of Abraham, had already paid tithes to Melchisedec.
