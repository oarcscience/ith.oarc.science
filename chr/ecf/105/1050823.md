<span id="xviii.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—He Concludes that the
Apostle Spoke in His Own Person, and that of Those Who are Under
Grace.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>On the careful consideration of
these things, and things of the same kind in the context of that
apostolical Scripture, the apostle is rightly understood to have
signified not, indeed, himself alone in his own person, but others also
established under grace, and with him not yet established in that
perfect peace in which death shall be swallowed up in victory. <span
id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585) And concerning this he afterwards
says, “But if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the
spirit is life because of righteousness. If, then, the Spirit of Him
that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, He that raised up
Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit
that dwelleth in you.” <span id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586)
Therefore, after our mortal bodies have been quickened, not only will
there be no consent to sinning, but even the lust of the flesh itself,
to which there is no consent, will not remain. And not to have this
resistance to the spirit in the mortal flesh, was possible only to that
man who came not by the flesh to men. And that the apostles, because
they were men, and carried about in the mortality of this life a body
which is corrupted and weighs down the soul,  <span
id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587) were, therefore, “always polluted
with excessive lust,” as that man injuriously affirms, be it far from me
to say. But I do say that although they were free from consent to
depraved lusts, they nevertheless groaned concerning the concupiscence
of the flesh, which they bridled by restraint with such humility and
piety, that they desired rather not to have it than to subdue it.
