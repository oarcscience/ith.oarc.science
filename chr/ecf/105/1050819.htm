<p><a name="xviii.iii.xx-p2"></A>And he declares both more plainly in what follows: &#8220;For I delight in the law of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2578"></A><A HREF="#fn_2578"><FONT SIZE="1">2579</FONT></A>
 But in that he said, &#8220;bringing me into captivity,&#8221; he can feel emotion without consenting to it. Whence, because of those three things, two, to wit, of which we have already argued, in that he says, &#8220;But I am carnal,&#8221; and &#8220;Sold under sin,&#8221; and this third, &#8220;Bringing me into captivity in the law of sin, which is in my members,&#8221; the apostle seems to be describing a man who is still living under the law, and is not yet under grace. But as I have expounded the former two sayings in respect of the still corruptible flesh, so also this latter may be understood as if he had said, &#8220;bringing me into captivity,&#8221; in the flesh, not in the mind; in emotion, not in consent; and therefore &#8220;bringing me into captivity,&#8221; because even in the flesh there is not an alien nature, but our own. As, therefore, he himself expounded what he had said, &#8220;For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing,&#8221; so also now out of the exposition of that we ought to learn the meaning of this passage, as if he had said, &#8220;Bringing <i>me</i> into captivity,&#8221; that is, &#8220;my flesh,&#8221; &#8220;to the law of sin, which is in my members.&#8221;</p>
