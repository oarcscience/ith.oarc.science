<span id="xvi.v.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[IX.\]—Why It Was Sometimes
Permitted that a Man Should Have Several Wives, Yet No Woman Was Ever
Allowed to Have More Than One Husband. Nature Prefers Singleness in Her
Dominations.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.x-p2"></span>Now, if to the God of our fathers, who is
likewise our God, such a plurality of wives had not been displeasing for
the purpose that lust might have a fuller range of indulgence; then, on
such a supposition, the holy women also ought each to have rendered
service to several husbands. But if any woman had so acted, what feeling
but that of a disgraceful concupiscence could impel her to have more
husbands, seeing that by such licence she could not have more children?
That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one
husband with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown
plainly enough by the very first union of a married pair, which was made
by the Divine Being Himself, with the intention of marriages taking
their beginning therefrom, and of its affording to them a more
honourable precedent. In the advance, however, of the human race, it
came to pass that to certain good men were united a plurality of good
wives,—many to each; and from this it would seem that moderation sought
rather unity on one side for dignity, while nature permitted plurality
on the other side for fecundity. For on natural principles it is more
feasible for one to have dominion over many, than for many to have
dominion over one. Nor can it be doubted, that it is more consonant with
the order of nature that men should bear rule over women, than women
over men. It is with this principle in view that the apostle says, “The
head of the woman is the man;” <span
id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085) and, “Wives, submit yourselves unto
your own husbands.” <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086) So also
<span id="page_268">p. 268</span> <span id="xvi.v.x-Page_268"></span>the
Apostle Peter writes: “Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him
lord.” <span id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087) Now, although the fact
of the matter is, that while nature loves singleness in her dominations,
but we may see plurality existing more readily in the subordinate
portion of our race; yet for all that, it was at no time lawful for one
man to have a plurality of wives, except for the purpose of a greater
number of children springing from him. Wherefore, if one woman cohabits
with several men, inasmuch as no increase of offspring accrues to her
therefrom, but only a more frequent gratification of lust, she cannot
possibly be a wife, but only a harlot.
