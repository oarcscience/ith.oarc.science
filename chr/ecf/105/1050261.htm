<p><a name="xii.xviii-p2"></A>But the truth is, the question which is proposed to him&#8212;&#8220;Are you even yourself without sin?&#8221;&#8212;does not really belong to the subject in dispute. What, however, he says,&#8212;that &#8220;it is rather to be imputed to his own negligence that he is not without sin,&#8221; is no doubt well spoken; but then he should deem it to be his duty even to pray to God that this faulty negligence get not the dominion over him,&#8212;the prayer that a certain man once put up, when he said: &#8220;Order my steps according to Thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">1155</FONT></A>
&#8212;lest, whilst relying on his own diligence as on strength of his own, he should fail to attain to the true righteousness either by this way, or by that other method in which, no doubt, perfect righteousness is to be desired and hoped for.</p>
