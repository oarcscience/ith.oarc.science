<span id="xi.ii-p6"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xi.ii-p6.1"></span>The</span> person <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) to whom I had addressed the three
books entitled *De Peccatorum Meritis et Remissione*, in which I
carefully discussed also the baptism of infants, informed me, when
acknowledging my communication, that he was much distrurbed because I
declared it to be possible that a man might be without sin, if he wanted
not the will, by the help of God, although no man either had lived, was
living, or would live in this life so perfect in righteousness. He asked
how I could say that it was possible of which no example could be
adduced. Owing to this inquiry on the part of this person, I wrote the
treatise entitled *De Spiritu et Littera*, in which I considered at
large the apostle’s statement, “The letter killeth, but the spirit
giveth life.” <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) In this work, so
far as God enabled me, I earnestly disputed with those who oppose that
grace of God which justifies the servances of the Jews, who abstain from
sundry meats and drinks in accordance with their ancient law, I
mentioned the “ceremonies of certain meats” \[*quarumdam escarum
cerimoniæ*\] <span id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) —a phrase which,
though not used in Holy Scriptures, seemed to me very convenient,
because I remembered that *cerimoniæ* is tantamount to *carimoniæ*, as
if from *carere*, to be without, and expresses the abstinence of the
worshippers from certain things. If however, there is any other
derivation of the word, which is inconsistent with the true religion, I
meant no refernce whatever to it; I confined my use to the sense above
indicated. This work of mine begins thus: “After reading the short
treatise which I lately drew up for you, my beloved son Marcellinus,”
etc.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_708"></span>[80:709](1050175.htm#fr_708.md) <span
id="xi.ii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p7"></span> The Tribune Marcellinus with whose name are
connected many other treatises of Augustin. In this work the author
informs us that the occasion of its composition was furnished by this
person, who mooted an inquiry touching a statement in the preceding
books *Concerning the Merits and the Remission of Sins*. Those books, as
we have already indicated, were published <span class="c16"><span
id="xi.ii-p7.1"></span>A.D.</span>, 412. Now in the *Retractations*
there is placed after these very books the present work *Concerning the
Spirit and the Letter*,—not indeed, immediately next, but in the fourth
place after,—so that it was written, no doubt, about the end of the same
year, <span class="c16"><span id="xi.ii-p7.2"></span> A.D.</span> 412,
some time previous to the death of Marcellinus, who was killed in the
month or September of the following year, 413. This present work is also
mentioned in the book *On Faith and Works*, c. 14; and in that *On
Christian Doctrine*, iii. 33. Compare the notes on p. 15 and p. 130.
