<span id="xix.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—The Question Answered.
Justification is Grace Simply and Entirely, Eternal Life is Reward and
Grace.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xx-p2"></span>This question, then, seems to me to be by
no means capable of solution, unless we understand that even those good
works of ours, which are recompensed with eternal life, belong to the
grace of God, because of what is said by the Lord Jesus: “Without me ye
can do nothing.” <span id="fr_3058"></span>[3059](#fn_3058.md) And the
apostle himself, after saying, “By grace are ye saved through faith; and
that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any
man should boast;” <span id="fr_3059"></span>[3060](#fn_3059.md) saw, of
course, the possibility that men would think from this statement that
good works are not necessary to those who believe, but that faith alone
suffices for them; and again, the possibility of men’s boasting of their
good works, as if they were of themselves capable of performing them. To
meet, therefore, these opinions on both sides, he immediately added,
“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.” <span
id="fr_3060"></span>[3061](#fn_3060.md) What is the purport of his saying,
“Not of works, lest any man should boast,” while commending the grace of
God? And then why does he afterwards, when giving a reason for using
such words, say, “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
unto good works”? Why, therefore, does it run, “Not of works, lest any
man should boast”? Now, hear and understand. “Not of works” is spoken of
the works which you suppose have their origin in yourself alone; but you
have to think of works for which God has moulded (that is, has formed
and created) you. For of these he says, “We are His workmanship, created
in Christ Jesus unto good works.” Now he does not here speak of that
creation which made us human beings, but of that in reference to which
one said who was already in full manhood, “Create in me a clean heart, O
God;” <span id="fr_3061"></span>[3062](#fn_3061.md) concerning which also
the apostle says, “Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new
creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
And all things are of God.” <span id="fr_3062"></span>[3063](#fn_3062.md)
We are framed, therefore, that is, formed and created, “in the good
works which” we have not ourselves prepared, but “God hath before
ordained that we should walk in them.” <span id="page_452">p. 452</span>
<span id="xix.iv.xx-Page_452"></span>It follows, then, dearly beloved,
beyond all doubt, that as your good life is nothing else than God’s
grace, so also the eternal life which is the recompense of a good life
is the grace of God; moreover it is given gratuitously, even as that is
given gratuitously to which it is given. But that to which it is given
is solely and simply grace; this therefore is also that which is given
to it, because it is its reward;—grace is for grace, as if remuneration
for righteousness; in order that it may be true, because it is true,
that God “shall reward every man according to his works.” <span
