id="xv.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[IX.\]—The Judgment of Innocent
Respecting the Proceedings in Palestine.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.x-p2"></span>Five bishops, then, of whom I was one,
wrote him a letter, <span id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938.md) wherein
we mentioned the proceedings in Palestine, of which the report had
already reached us. We informed him that in the East, where this man
lived, there had taken place certain ecclesiastical proceedings, in
which he was thought to have been acquitted on all the charges. To this
communication from us Innocent replied in a letter which contains the
following among other words: “There are,” says he, “sundry positions, as
stated in these very Proceedings, which, when they were objected against
him, he partly suppressed by avoiding them, and partly confused in
absolute obscurity, by wresting the sense of many words; whilst there
are other allegations which he cleared off,—not, indeed, in the honest
way which he might seem at the time to use, but rather by methods of
sophistry, meeting some of the objections with a flat denial, and
tampering with others by a fallacious interpretation. Would, however,
that he would even now adopt what is the far more desirable course of
turning from his own error back to the true ways of catholic faith; that
he would also, duly considering God’s daily grace, and acknowledging the
help thereof, be willing and desirous to appear, amidst the approbation
of all men, to be truly corrected by the method of open conviction,—not,
indeed, by judicial process, but by a hearty conversion to the catholic
faith. We are therefore unable either to approve of or to blame their
proceedings at that trial; for we cannot tell whether the proceedings
were true, or even, if true, whether they do not really show that the
man escaped by subterfuge, rather than that he cleared himself by entire
truth.” <span id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939.md) You see clearly from
these words, how that the most blessed Pope Innocent without doubt
speaks of this man as of one who was by no means unknown to him. You see
what opinion he entertained about his acquittal. You see, moreover, what
his successor the holy Pope Zosimus was bound to recollect,—as in truth
he did,—so as to confirm without hesitation the judgment of his
predecessor in this case.
