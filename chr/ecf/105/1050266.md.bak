<span id="xii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Sins of Ignorance; To Whom Wisdom
is Given by God on Their Requesting It.</span>

<span id="xii.xxiii-p2"></span>He further treats of sins of ignorance,
and says that “a man ought to be very careful to avoid ignorance; and
that ignorance is blameworthy for this reason, because it is through his
own neglect that a man is ignorant of that which he certainly must have
known if he had only applied diligence;” whereas he prefers disputing
all things rather than to pray, and say: “Give me understanding, that I
may learn Thy commandments.” <span id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md)
It is, indeed, one thing to have taken no pains to know what sins of
negligence were apparently expiated even through divers sacrifices of
the law; it is another thing to wish to understand, to be unable, and
then to act contrary to the law, through not understanding what it would
have done. We are accordingly enjoined to ask of God wisdom, “who giveth
to all men liberally;” <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) that
is, of course, to all men who ask in such a manner, and to such an
extent, as so great a matter requires in earnestness of petition.
