<span id="xvii.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—His Fourth Quotation.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>We have read all about the mother of
the Maccabean youths, who was really more fruitful in virtues when her
children suffered than of children when they were born; how she exhorted
them to constancy, speaking in this wise: “I cannot tell, my sons, how
ye came into my womb. For it was not I who gave you spirit and soul, nor
was it I that formed the members of every one of you; but it was God,
who also made the world, and all things that are therein; who, moreover,
formed the generation of men; and searches the action <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) of all; and who will Himself of His
great mercy restore to you your spirit and soul.” <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) All this we know; but how it
supports this man’s assertion we do not see. For what Christian would
deny that God gives to men soul and spirit? But similarly, I suppose
that he cannot deny that God gives to men their tongue, and ear, and
hand, and foot, and all their bodily sensations, and the form and nature
of all their limbs. For how is he going to deny all these to be the
gifts of God, unless he forgets that he is a Christian? As, however, it
is evident that these were made by Him, and bestowed on man by
propagation; so also the question must arise, by what means man’s spirit
and soul are formed by Him; by what efficiency given to man—from the
parents, or from nothing, or (as this man asserts, in a sense which we
must by all means guard against) from some existing nature of the divine
breath, not created out of nothing, but out of His own self?
