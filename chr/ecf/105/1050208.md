<span id="xi.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32 \[XIX.\]—The Christian Faith
Touching the Assistance of Grace.</span>

<span id="xi.xxxv-p2"></span>Let no Christian then stray from this
faith, which alone is the Christian one; nor let any one, when he has
been made to feel ashamed to <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span
id="xi.xxxv-Page_97"></span>say that we become righteous through our own
selves, without the grace of God working this in us,—because he sees,
when such an allegation is made, how unable pious believers are to
endure it,—resort to any subterfuge on this point, by affirming that the
reason why we cannot become righteous without the operation of God’s
grace is this, that He gave the law, He instituted its teaching, He
commanded its precepts of good. For there is no doubt that, without His
assisting grace, the law is “the letter which killeth;” but when the
life-giving spirit is present, the law causes that to be loved as
written within, which it once caused to be feared as written without.
