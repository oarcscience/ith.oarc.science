<span id="xiii.iii-p6"></span>*A paper containing sundry
definitions,* <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361) *said to have
been drawn up by Cœlestius, was put into the hands of Augustin. In this
document, Cœlestius, or some person who shared in his errors, had
recklessly asserted that a man had it in his power to live here without
sin. Augustin first refutes the several propositions in brief answers,
showing that the perfect and plenary state of righteousness, in which a
man exists absolutely without sin, is unattainable without grace by the
mere resources of our corrupt nature, and never occurs in this present
state of existence. He next proceeds to consider the authorities which
the paper contained as gathered out of the Scriptures; some of them
teaching man to be “unspotted” and “perfect;” others mentioning the
commandments of God as “not grievous;” while others again are quoted as
opposed to the authoritative passages which the Catholics were
accustomed to advance against the Pelagians.*

Augustin also calls *ratiocinationes*, are short argumentative
statements, which may be designated *breviates*.
