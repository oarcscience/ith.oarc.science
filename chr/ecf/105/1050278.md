<span id="xii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—The Order and Process of Healing
Our Heavenly Physician Does Not Adopt from the Sick Patient, But Derives
from Himself. What Cause the Righteous Have for Fearing.</span>

<span id="xii.xxxv-p2"></span>“But God,” they say, “is able to heal all
things.” Of course His purpose in acting is to heal all things; but He
acts on His own judgment, and does not take His procedure in healing
from the sick man. For undoubtedly it was His wish to endow His apostle
with very great power and strength, and yet He said to him: “My strength
is made perfect in weakness;” <span id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md)
nor did He remove from him, though he so often entreated Him to do so,
that mysterious “thorn in the flesh,” which He told him had been given
to him “lest he should be unduly exalted through the abundance of the
revelation.” <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md) For all other
sins only prevail in evil deeds; pride only has to be guarded against in
things that are rightly done. Whence it happens that those persons are
admonished not to attribute to their own power the gifts of God, nor to
plume themselves thereon, lest by so doing they should perish with a
<span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span
id="xii.xxxv-Page_132"></span>heavier perdition than if they had done no
good at all, to whom it is said: “Work out your own salvation with fear
and trembling, for it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to
do of His good pleasure.” <span id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md)
Why, then, must it be with fear and trembling, and not rather with
security, since God is working; except it be because there so quickly
steals over our human soul, by reason of our will (without which we can
do nothing well), the inclination to esteem simply as our own
accomplishment whatever good we do; and so each one of us says in his
prosperity: “I shall never be moved?” <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md) Therefore, He who in His good
pleasure had added strength to our beauty, turns away His face, and the
man who had made his boast becomes troubled, because it is by actual
sorrows that the swelling pride must be remedied.
