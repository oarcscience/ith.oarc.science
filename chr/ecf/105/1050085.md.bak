<span id="x.iii.lxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 67 \[XXXVI.\]—On the Ignorance of
Infants, and Whence It Arises.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lxvii-p2"></span>Yes, let us consider that darkness of
their rational intellect, by reason of which they are even completely
ignorant of God, whose sacraments they actually struggle against, while
being baptized. Now my inquiry is, When and whence came they to be
immersed in this darkness? Is it then the fact that they incurred it all
*here*, and in this their own proper life forgat God through too much
negligence, after a life of wisdom and religion in their mother’s womb?
Let those say so who dare; let them listen to it who wish to; let them
believe it who can. I, however, am sure that none whose minds are not
blinded by an obstinate adherence to a foregone conclusion can possibly
entertain such an opinion. Is there then no evil in ignorance,—nothing
which needs to be purged away? What means that prayer “Remember not the
sins of my youth and of my ignorance?” <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) For although those sins are more to be
condemned which are knowingly committed, yet if there were no sins of
ignorance, we should not have read in Scripture what I have quoted,
“Remember not the sins of my youth and of my ignorance.” Seeing now that
the soul of an infant fresh from its mother’s womb is still the soul of
a human being,—nay, the soul of a rational creature,—not only untaught,
but even incapable of instruction, I ask why, or when, or whence, it was
plunged into that thick darkness of ignorance in which it lies? If it is
man’s nature thus to begin, and that nature is not already corrupt, then
why was not Adam created thus? Why was he capable of receiving a
commandment? and able to give names to his wife, and to all the animal
creation? For of her he said, “She shall be called Woman;” <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) and in respect of the rest we read:
“Whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name
thereof.” <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) Whereas this one,
although he is ignorant where he is, what he is, by whom created, of
what parents born, is already guilty of offence, incapable as yet of
receiving a commandment, and so completely involved and overwhelmed in a
thick cloud of ignorance, that he cannot be aroused out of his sleep, so
as to recognize even these facts; but a time must be patiently awaited,
until he can shake off this strange intoxication, as it were, (not
indeed in a single night, as even the heaviest drunkenness usually can
be, but) little by little, through many months, and even years; and
until this be accomplished, we have to bear in little children so many
things which we punish in older persons, that we cannot enumerate them.
Now, as touching this enormous evil of ignorance and weakness, if in
this present life infants have contracted it as soon as they were born,
where, when, how, have they by the perpetration of some great iniquity
become suddenly implicated in such darkness?
