<span id="xvi.vi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Man, by Birth, is Placed Under
the Dominion of the Devil Through Sin; We Were All One in Adam When He
Sinned.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xvi-p2"></span>He then proceeds to ask: “Why, then, are
they in the devil’s power whom God created?” And he finds an answer to
his own question apparently from a phrase of mine. “Because of sin,”
says he, “not because of nature.” Then framing his answer in reference
to mine, he says: “But as there cannot be offspring without the sexes,
so there cannot be sin without the will.” Yes, indeed, such is the
truth. For even as “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; so also has death passed through to all men, for in him all have
sinned.” <span id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229.md) By the evil will of
that one man all sinned in him, since all were that one man, from whom,
therefore, they individually derived original sin. “For you allege,”
says he, “that the reason why they are in the devil’s power is because
they are born of the union of the two sexes.” I plainly aver that it is
by reason of transgression that they are in the devil’s power, and that
their participation, moreover, of this transgression is due to the
circumstance that they are born of the said union of the sexes, which
cannot even accomplish its own honourable function without the incident
of shameful lust. This has also, in fact, been said by Ambrose, of most
blessed memory, bishop of the church in Milan, when he gives as the
reason why Christ’s birth in the flesh was free from all sinful fault,
that His conception was not the result of a union of the two sexes;
whereas there is not one among human beings conceived in such union who
is without sin. These are his precise words: “On that account, and being
man, He was tried by every sort of temptation, and in the likeness of
man He bore them all; inasmuch, however, as He was born of the Spirit,
He abstained from all sin. For every man is a liar, and none is without
sin, but God only. It has accordingly,” adds he, “been constantly
observed, that clearly no one who is born of a man and a woman, that is
to say, through the union of their bodies, is free from sin; for whoever
is free from sin is free also from conception of this kind.” <span
id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230.md) Well now, will you dare, ye
disciples of Pelagius and Cœlestius, to call this man a Manichean? as
the heretic Jovinian did, when the holy bishop maintained the permanent
virginity of the blessed Mary even after child-bearing, in opposition to
this man’s impiety. If, however, you do not dare to call him a
Manichean, why do you call us Manicheans when we defend the catholic
faith in the self-same cause and with the self same opinions? But if you
will taunt that most faithful man with having entertained Manichean
error in this matter, there is no help for it, you must enjoy your
taunts as best you may, and so fill up Jovinian’s measure more fully; as
for ourselves, we can patiently endure along with <span id="page_289">p.
289</span> <span id="xvi.vi.xvi-Page_289"></span>such a man of God your
taunts and jibes. And yet your heresiarch Pelagius commends Ambrose’s
faith and extreme purity in the knowledge of the Scriptures so greatly,
as to declare that not even an enemy could venture to find fault with
him. Observe, then, to what length you have gone, and refrain from
following any further in the audacious steps of Jovinian. And yet that
man, although by his excessive commendation of marriage he put it on a
par with holy virginity, never denied the necessity of Christ to save
those who are born of marriage even fresh from their mother’s womb, and
to redeem them from the power of the devil. This, however, you deny; and
because we oppose you in defence of those who cannot yet speak for
themselves, and in defence of the very foundations of the catholic
faith, you taunt us, with being Manicheans. But let us now see what
comes next.
