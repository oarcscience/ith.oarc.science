id="xvii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—Renatus Had Done Him a
Kindness by Sending Him the Books Which Had Been Addressed to
Him.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xvii.iv.i-p2.1"></span>Your</span> sincerity towards us, dearest
brother Renatus, and your brotherly kindness, and the affection of
mutual love between us, we already had clear proof of; but now you have
afforded us a still clearer proof, by sending me two books, written by a
person whom I knew, indeed, nothing of,—though he was not on that
account to be despised,—called Vincentius Victor (for in such form did I
find his name placed at the head of his work): this you did in the
summer of last year; but owing to my absence from home, it was the end
of autumn before they found their way to me. How, indeed, would you be
likely with your very great affection for me to fail either in means or
inclination to bring under my notice any writings of the kind, by
whomsoever composed, if they fell into your hands, even if they were
addressed to some one else? How much less likely, when my own name was
mentioned and read—and that in a context of gainsaying some words of
mine, which I had published in certain little treatises? Now you have
done all this in the way you were sure to act as my very sincere and
beloved friend.
