id="xiv.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49 \[XXV.\]—Pelagius’ Behaviour
Contrasted with that of the Writers of the Letter.</span>

<span id="xiv.liii-p2"></span>If now that man, <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748) too, were to confess that he had
once been implicated in this error as a person possessed, but that he
now anathematized all that hold these opinions, whoever should withhold
his congratulation from him, now that he was in possession of the way of
truth, would surely surrender all the bowels of love. As the case,
however, now stands, he has not only not acknowledged his liberation
from his pestilential error; but, as if that were a small thing, he has
gone on to anathematize men who have reached that freedom, who love him
so well that they would fain desire his own emancipation. Amongst these
are those very men who have expressed their good-will towards him in the
letter, which they forwarded to me. For he it was whom they had chiefly
in view when they said how much they were affected at the fact of my
having at last written that work. “If, indeed, it has happened,” they
say, “that some are removed from the influence of this clearest light of
truth, whose blindness required its illumination, yet even to them,”
they go on to remark, “we doubt not, the self-same grace will find its
way, by the merciful favour of God.” Any name, or names, even they, too,
thought it desirable as yet to suppress, in order that, if friendship
still lived on, the error of the friends might the more surely die.
