id="xiv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—Augustin Indulgently Shows that the
Judges Acted Incautiously in Their Official Conduct of the Case of
Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xiv.xlv-p2"></span>Why, then (some one will say), did the
judges approve of this? I confess that I hardly even now understand why
they did. It is, however, not to be wondered at, if some brief word or
phrase too easily escaped their attention and ear; or if, because they
thought it capable of being somehow interpreted in a correct sense, from
seeming to have from the accused himself such clear confessions of truth
on the subject, they decided it to be hardly worth while to excite a
discussion about a word. The same feeling might have occurred to
ourselves also, if we had sat with them at the trial. For if, instead of
the term *worthy*, the word *predestinated* had been used, or some such
word, my mind would certainly not have entertained any doubt, much less
have been disquieted by it; and yet if it were asserted, that he who is
justified by the election of grace is called *worthy*, through no
antecedent merits of good indeed, but by destination, just as he is
called “elect,” it would be really difficult to determine whether he
might be so designated at all, or at least without some offence to an
intelligent view of the subject.

<span id="xiv.xlv-p3"></span>As for myself, indeed, I might readily pass
on from the discussion on this word, were it not that the treatise which
called forth my reply, and in which he says that there is no God’s grace
at all except our own nature gratuitously created <span
id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739) with free will, made me suspicious
and anxious about the actual meaning of Pelagius—whether he had procured
the introduction of the term into the argument without any accurate
intention as to its sense, or else as a carefully drawn dogmatic
expression. The last remaining statements had such an effect on the
judges, that they deemed them worthy of condemnation, without waiting
for Pelagius’ answer.
