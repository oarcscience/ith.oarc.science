<span id="v.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>II. The External History of the Pelagian
Controversy.</span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p2"></span>Pelagius seems to have been already
somewhat softened by increasing age when he came to Rome about the
opening of the fifth century. He was also constitutionally averse to
controversy; and although in his zeal for Christian morals, and in his
conviction that no man would attempt to do what he was not persuaded he
had natural power to perform, he diligently propagated his doctrines
privately, he was careful to rouse no opposition, and was content to
make what progress he could quietly and without open discussion. His
methods of work sufficiently appear in the pages of his “Commentary on
the Epistles of Saint Paul,” which was written and published during
these years, and which exhibits learning and a sober and correct but
somewhat shallow exegetical skill. In this work, he manages to give
expression to all the main elements of his system, but always introduces
them indirectly, not as the true exegesis, but by way of objections to
the ordinary teaching, which were in need of discussion. The most
important fruit of his residence in Rome <span id="page_xviii">p.
xviii</span> <span id="v.ii.ii-Page_xviii"></span>was the conversion to
his views of the Advocate Cœlestius, who brought the courage of youth
and the argumentative training of a lawyer to the propagation of the new
teaching. It was through him that it first broke out into public
controversy, and received its first ecclesiastical examination and
rejection. Fleeing from Alaric’s second raid on Rome, the two friends
landed together in Africa (<span class="c16"><span
id="v.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>A.D.</span> 411), whence Pelagius soon
afterwards departed for Palestine, leaving the bolder and more
contentious <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) Cœlestius behind at
Carthage. Here Cœlestius sought ordination as a presbyter. But the
Milanese deacon Paulinus stood forward in accusation of him as a
heretic, and the matter was brought before a synod under the presidency
of Bishop Aurelius. <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md)

<span id="v.ii.ii-p5"></span>Paulinus’ charge consisted of seven
items, <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) which asserted that
Cœlestius taught the following heresies: that Adam was made mortal, and
would have died, whether he sinned or did not sin; that the sin of Adam
injured himself alone, not the human race; that new-born children are in
that state in which Adam was before his sin; that the whole human race
does not, on the one hand, die on account of the death or the fall of
Adam, nor, on the other, rise again on account of the resurrection of
Christ; that infants, even though not baptized, have eternal life; that
the law leads to the kingdom of heaven in the same way as the gospel;
and that, even before the Lord’s coming, there had been men without sin.
Only two fragments of the proceedings of the synod in investigating this
charge have come down to us; <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) but it
is easy to see that Cœlestius was contumacious, and refused to reject
any of the propositions charged against him, except the one which had
reference to the salvation of infants that die unbaptized,—the sole one
that admitted of sound defence. As touching the transmission of sin, he
would only say that it was an open question in the Church, and that he
had heard both opinions from Church dignitaries; so that the subject
needed investigation, and should not be made the ground for a charge of
heresy. The natural result was, that, on refusing to condemn the
propositions charged against him, he was himself condemned and
excommunicated by the synod. Soon afterwards he sailed to Ephesus, where
he obtained the ordination which he sought.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p8"></span>Meanwhile Pelagius was living quietly in
Palestine, whither in the summer of 415 a young Spanish presbyter,
Paulus Orosius by name, came with letters from Augustin to Jerome, and
was invited, near the end of July in that year, to a diocesan synod,
presided over by John of Jerusalem. There he was asked about Pelagius
and Cœlestius, and proceeded to give an account of the condemnation of
the latter at the synod of Carthage, and of Augustin’s literary
refutation of the former. Pelagius was sent for, and the proceedings
became an examination into his teachings. The chief matter brought up
was his assertion of the possibility of men living sinlessly in this
world; but the favour of the bishop towards him, the intemperance of
Orosius, and the difficulty of communication between the parties arising
from difference of language, combined so to clog proceedings that
nothing was done; and the whole matter, as Western in its origin, was
referred to the Bishop of Rome for examination and decision. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md)

<span id="v.ii.ii-p10"></span>Soon afterwards two Gallic bishops,—Heros
of Arles, and Lazarus of Aix,—who were then in Palestine, lodged a
formal accusation against Pelagius with the metropolitan, Eulogius of
Cæsarea; and he convened a synod of fourteen bishops which met at Lydda
(Diospolis), in December of the same year (415), for the trial of the
case. Perhaps no greater ecclesiastical farce was ever enacted than this
synod exhibited. <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) When the time
arrived, the accusers were prevented from being present by illness, and
Pelagius was confronted only by the written accusation. This was both
unskilfully drawn, and was written in Latin which the synod did not
understand. It was, therefore, not even consecutively read, and was only
head by head rendered into Greek by an interpreter. Pelagius began by
reading aloud several letters to himself from various men of reputation
<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span> <span id="v.ii.ii-Page_xix"></span>in
the Episcopate,—among them a friendly note from Augustin. Thoroughly
acquainted with both Latin and Greek, he was enabled skillfully to
thread every difficulty, and pass safely through the ordeal. Jerome
called this a “miserable synod,” and not unjustly: at the same time it
is sufficient to vindicate the honesty and earnestness of the bishops’
intentions, that even in such circumstances, and despite the more
undeveloped opinions of the East on the questions involved, Pelagius
escaped condemnation only by a course of most ingenious
disingenuousness, and only at the cost both of disowning Cœlestius and
his teachings, of which he had been the real father, and of leading the
synod to believe that he was anathematizing the very doctrines which he
was himself proclaiming. There is really no possibility of doubting, as
any one will see who reads the proceedings of the synod, that Pelagius
obtained his acquittal here either by a “lying condemnation or a tricky
interpretation”  <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) of his own
teachings; and Augustin is perfectly justified in asserting that the
“heresy was not acquitted, but the man who denied the heresy,” <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) and who would himself have been
anathematized had he not anathematized the heresy.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p14"></span>However obtained, the acquittal of
Pelagius was yet an accomplished fact. Neither he nor his friends
delayed to make the most widely extended use of their good fortune.
Pelagius himself was jubilant. Accounts of the synodal proceedings were
sent to the West, not altogether free from uncandid alterations; and
Pelagius soon put forth a work *In Defence of Free-Will*, in which he
triumphed in his acquittal and “explained his explanations” at the
synod. Nor were the champions of the opposite opinion idle. As soon as
the news arrived in North Africa, and before the authentic records of
the synod had reached that region, the condemnation of Pelagius and
Cœlestius was re-affirmed in two provincial synods,—one, consisting of
sixty-eight bishops, met at Carthage about midsummer of 416; and the
other, consisting of about sixty bishops, met soon afterwards at Mileve
(Mila). Thus Palestine and North Africa were arrayed against one
another, and it became of great importance to obtain the support of the
Patriarchal See of Rome. Both sides made the attempt, but fortune
favored the Africans. Each of the North-African synods sent a synodal
letter to Innocent I., then Bishop of Rome, engaging his assent to their
action: to these, five bishops, Aurelius of Carthage and Augustin among
them, added a third “familiar” letter of their own, in which they urged
upon Innocent to examine into Pelagius’ teaching, and provided him with
the material on which he might base a decision. The letters reached
Innocent in time for him to take advice of his clergy, and send
favorable replies on Jan. 27, 417. In these he expressed his agreement
with the African decisions, asserted the necessity of inward grace,
rejected the Pelagian theory of infant baptism, and declared Pelagius
and Cœlestius excommunicated until they should return to orthodoxy. In
about six weeks more he was dead: but Zosimus, his successor, was
scarcely installed in his place before Cœlestius appeared at Rome in
person to plead his cause; while shortly afterwards letters arrived from
Pelagius addressed to Innocent, and by an artful statement of his belief
and a recommendation from Praylus, lately become bishop of Jerusalem in
John’s stead, attempting to enlist Rome in his favour. Zosimus, who
appears to have been a Greek and therefore inclined to make little of
the merits of this Western controversy, went over to Cœlestius at once,
upon his profession of willingness to anathematize all doctrines which
the pontifical see had condemned or should condemn; and wrote a sharp
and arrogant letter to Africa, proclaiming Cœlestius “catholic,” and
requiring the Africans to appear within two months at Rome to prosecute
their charges, or else to abandon them. On the arrival of Pelagius’
papers, this letter was followed by another (September, 417), in which
Zosimus, with the approbation of the clergy, declared both Pelagius and
Cœlestius to be orthodox, and severely rebuked the Africans for their
hasty judgment. It is difficult to understand Zosimus’ action in this
matter: neither of the confessions presented by the accused teachers
ought to have deceived him, and if he was seizing the occasion to
magnify the Roman see, his mistake was dreadful. Late in 417, or early
in 418, the African bishops assembled at Carthage, in number more than
two <span id="page_xx">p. xx</span> <span
id="v.ii.ii-Page_xx"></span>hundred, and replied to Zosimus that they
had decided that the sentence pronounced against Pelagius and Cœlestius
should remain in force until they should unequivocally acknowledge that
“we are aided by the grace of God, through Christ, not only to know, but
to do what is right, in each single act, so that without grace we are
unable to have, think, speak, or do anything pertaining to piety.” This
firmness made Zosimus waver. He answered swellingly but timidly,
declaring that he had maturely examined the matter, but it had not been
his intention finally to acquit Cœlestius; and now he had left all
things in the condition in which they were before, but he claimed the
right of final judgment to himself. Matters were hastening to a
conclusion, however, that would leave him no opportunity to escape from
the mortification of an entire change of front. This letter was written
on the 21st of March, 418; it was received in Africa on the 29th of
April; and on the very next day an imperial decree was issued from
Ravenna ordering Pelagius and Cœlestius to be banished from Rome, with
all who held their opinions; while on the next day, May 1, a plenary
council of about two hundred bishops met at Carthage, and in nine canons
condemned all the essential features of Pelagianism. Whether this
simultaneous action was the result of skillful arrangement, can only be
conjectured: its effect was in any case necessarily crushing. There
could be no appeal from the civil decision, and it played directly into
the hands of the African definition of the faith. The synod’s nine
canons part naturally into three triads. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) The first of these deals with the
relation of mankind to original sin, and anathematizes in turn those who
assert that physical death is a necessity of nature, and not a result of
Adam’s sin; those who assert that new-born children derive nothing of
original sin from Adam to be expiated by the laver of regeneration; and
those who assert a distinction between the kingdom of heaven and eternal
life, for entrance into the former of which alone baptism is necessary.
The second triad deals with the nature of grace, and anathematizes those
who assert that grace brings only remission of past sins, not aid in
avoiding future ones; those who assert that grace aids us not to sin,
only by teaching us what is sinful, not by enabling us to will and do
what we know to be right; and those who assert that grace only enables
us to do more easily what we should without it still be able to do. The
third triad deals with the universal sinfulness of the race, and
anathematizes those who assert that the apostles’ ([1 John i.
8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008)<span id="v.ii.ii-p15.1"></span>.md)
confession of sin is due only to their humility; those who say that
“Forgive us our trespasses” in the Lord’s Prayer, is pronounced by the
saints, not for themselves, but for the sinners in their company; and
those who say that the saints use these words of themselves only out of
humility and not truly. Here we see a careful traversing of the whole
ground of the controversy, with a conscious reference to the three chief
contentions of the Pelagian teachers. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md)

<span id="v.ii.ii-p17"></span>The appeal to the civil power, by
whomsoever made, was, of course, indefensible, although it accorded with
the opinions of the day, and was entirely approved by Augustin. But it
was the ruin of the Pelagian cause. Zosimus found himself forced either
to go into banishment with his wards, or to desert their cause. He
appears never to have had any personal convictions on the dogmatic
points involved in the controversy, and so, all the more readily,
yielded to the necessity of the moment. He cited Cœlestius to appear
before a council for a new examination; but that heresiarch consulted
prudence, and withdrew from the city. Zosimus, possibly in the effort to
appear a leader in the cause he had opposed, not only condemned and
excommunicated the men whom less than six months before he had
pronounced “orthodox” after a ‘mature consideration of the matters
involved,’ but, in obedience to the imperial decree, issued a stringent
paper which condemned Pelagius and the Pelagians, and affirmed the
African doctrines as to corruption of nature, true grace, and the
necessity of baptism. To this he required subscription from all bishops
as a test of orthodoxy. Eighteen Italian bishops refused their
signature, with Julian of Eclanum, henceforth to be the champion of the
Pelagian party, at their head, and were therefore deposed, although
several of them afterwards recanted, and were restored. In Julian, the
<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span> <span
id="v.ii.ii-Page_xxi"></span>heresy obtained an advocate, who, if aught
could have been done for its re-instatement, would surely have proved
successful. He was the boldest, the strongest, at once the most acute
and the most weighty, of all the disputants of his party. But the
ecclesiastical standing of this heresy was already determined. The
policy of Zosimus’ test act was imposed by imperial authority on North
Africa in 419. The exiled bishops were driven from Constantinople by
Atticus in 424; and they are said to have been condemned at a Cilician
synod in 423, and at an Antiochian one in 424. Thus the East itself was
preparing for the final act in the drama. The exiled bishops were with
Nestorius at Constantinople in 429; and that patriarch unsuccessfully
interceded for them with Cœlestine, then Bishop of Rome. The conjunction
was ominous. And at the ecumenical synod at Ephesus in 431, we again
find the “Cœlestians” side by side with Nestorius, sharers in his
condemnation.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p18"></span>But Pelagianism did not so die as not to
leave a legacy behind it. “Remainders of Pelagianism” <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) soon showed themselves in Southern Gaul,
where a body of monastic leaders attempted to find a middle ground on
which they could stand, by allowing the Augustinian doctrine of
assisting grace, but retaining the Pelagian conception of our
self-determination to good. We first hear of them in 428, through
letters from two laymen, Prosper and Hilary, to Augustin, as men who
accepted original sin and the necessity of grace, but asserted that men
began their turning to God, and God helped their beginning. They
taught <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) that all men are sinners,
and that they derive their sin from Adam; that they can by no means save
themselves, but need God’s assisting grace; and that this grace is
gratuitous in the sense that men cannot really deserve it, and yet that
it is not irresistible, nor given always without the occasion of its
gift having been determined by men’s attitude towards God; so that,
though not given on account of the merits of men, it is given according
to those merits, actual or foreseen. The leader of this new movement was
John Cassian, a pupil of Chrysostom (to whom he attributed all that was
good in his life and will), and the fountain-head of Gallic monasticism;
and its chief champion at a somewhat later day was Faustus of Rhegium
(Riez).

<span id="v.ii.ii-p21"></span>The Augustinian opposition was at first
led by the vigorous controversialist, Prosper of Aquitaine, and, in the
next century, by the wise, moderate, and good Cæsarius of Arles, who
brought the contest to a conclusion in the victory of a softened
Augustinianism. Already in 431 a letter was obtained from Pope
Cœlestine, designed to close the controversy in favor of Augustinianism,
and in 496 Pope Gelasius condemned the writings of Faustus in the first
index of forbidden books; while, near the end of the first quarter of
the sixth century, Pope Hormisdas was appealed to for a renewed
condemnation. The end was now in sight. The famous second Synod of
Orange met under the presidency of Cæsarius at that ancient town on the
3d of July, 529, and drew up a series of moderate articles which
received the ratification of Boniface II. in the following year. In
these articles there is affirmed an anxiously guarded Augustinianism, a
somewhat weakened Augustinianism, but yet a distinctive Augustinianism;
and, so far as a formal condemnation could reach, semi-Pelagianism was
suppressed by them in the whole Western Church. But councils and popes
can only decree; and Cassian and Vincent and Faustus, despite Cæsarius
and Boniface and Gregory, retained an influence among their countrymen
which never died away.
