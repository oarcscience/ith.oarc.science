<span id="xi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\] —The Occasion of Writing This
Work; A Thing May Be Capable of Being Done, and Yet May Never Be
Done.</span>

<span id="xi.iv-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xi.iv-p2.1"></span>After</span> reading the short treatises which I
lately drew up for you, my beloved son Marcellinus, about the baptism of
infants, and the perfection of man’s righteousness,—how that no one in
this life seems either to have attained or to be likely to attain to it,
except only the Mediator, who bore humanity in the likeness of sinful
flesh, without any sin whatever,—you wrote me in answer that you were
embarrassed by the point which I advanced in the second book, <span
id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) that it was possible for a man to be
without sin, if he wanted not the will, and was assisted by the aid of
God; and yet that except One in whom “all shall be made alive,” <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md) no one has ever lived or will live by
whom this perfection has been attained whilst living here. It appeared
to you absurd to say that anything was possible of which no example ever
occurred,—although I suppose you would not hesitate to admit that no
camel ever passed through a needle’s eye, <span
id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) and yet He said that even this was
possible with God; you may read, too, that twelve thousand legions <span
id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) of angels could possibly have fought
for Christ and rescued Him from suffering, but in fact did not; you may
read that it was possible for the nations to be exterminated at once out
of the land which was given to the <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="xi.iv-Page_84"></span>children of Israel, <span
id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) and yet that God willed it to be
gradually effected. <span id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) And one may
meet with a thousand other incidents, the past or the future possibility
of which we might readily admit, and yet be unable to produce any proofs
of their having ever really happened. Accordingly, it would not be right
for us to deny the possibility of a man’s living without sin, on the
ground that amongst men none can be found except Him who is in His
nature not man only, but also God, in whom we could prove such
perfection of character to have existed.
