<span id="xvii.vii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XXIII.\]—Wide and Narrow
Sense of the Word “Spirit.”</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxxvii-p2"></span>But now, with a view to our easier
elucidation, I beg you to observe that what is the soul is also
designated spirit in the scripture which narrates an incident in our
Lord’s death, thus, “He bowed His head and gave up the spirit.” <span
id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514.md) Now, when you hear or read these
words, you wish to understand them as if the whole were signified <span
id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.xxxvii-Page_370"></span>by a part, and not because that
which is the soul may also be called spirit. But I shall, for the
purpose of being able the more readily to prove what I say, actually
summon yourself with all promptitude and convenience as my witness. For
you have defined spirit in such terms that cattle appear not to have a
spirit, but a soul. Irrational animals are so called, because they have
not the power of intelligence and reason. Accordingly, when you
admonished man himself to know his own nature, you spoke as follows:
“Now, inasmuch as the good God has made nothing without a purpose, He
has produced man himself as a rational animal, capable of intelligence,
endowed with reason, and enlivened by sensibility, so as to be able to
distribute in a wise arrangement all things that are void of reason.” In
these words of yours you have plainly asserted what is certainly most
true, that man is endowed with reason and capable of intelligence,
which, of course, animals void of reason are not. And you have, in
accordance with this view, quoted a passage of Scripture, and, adopting
its language, have compared men of no understanding to the cattle,
which, of course, have not intellect. <span
id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515.md) A statement the like to which
occurs in another passage of Scripture: “Be ye not as the horse or as
the mule, which have no understanding.” <span
id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516.md) This being the case, I want you
also to observe in what terms you have defined and described the spirit
when trying to distinguish it from the soul: “This soul,” you say,
“which has its origin from the breath of God, could not have possibly
been without an inner sense and intellect of its own; and this is the
spirit.” A little afterwards you add: “And although the soul animates
the body, yet inasmuch as it possesses sense, and wisdom, and vigour,
there must needs be a spirit.” And then somewhat further on you say:
“The soul is one thing, and the spirit—which is the soul’s wisdom and
sense—is another.” In these words you plainly enough indicate what you
take the spirit of man to mean; that it is even our rational faculty,
whereby the soul exercises sense and intelligence,—not, indeed, the
sensation which is felt by the bodily senses, but the operation of that
innermost sense from which arises the term sentiment. Owing to this it
is, no doubt, that we are placed above brute animals, since these are
unendowed with reason. These animals therefore have not *spirit*,—that
is to say, intellect and a sense of reason and wisdom,—but only *soul*.
For it is of these that it was spoken, “Let the waters bring forth the
creeping creatures that have a living soul;” <span
id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517.md) and again, “Let the earth bring
forth the living soul.” <span id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518.md) In
order, indeed, that you may have the fullest and clearest assurance that
what is the *soul* is in the usage of the Holy Scriptures also called
*spirit*, the soul of a brute animal has the designation of spirit. And
of course cattle have not that spirit which you, my beloved brother,
have defined as being distinct from the soul. It is therefore quite
evident that the soul of a brute animal could be rightly called “spirit”
in a general sense of the term; as we read in the Book of Ecclesiastes,
“Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of men, whether it goeth upward; and
the *spirit of the beast*, whether it goeth downward into the
earth?” <span id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519.md) In like manner,
touching the devastation of the deluge, the Scripture testifies, “All
flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and
of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and
every man: and all things which have the spirit of life.” <span
id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520.md) Here, if we remove all the windings
of doubtful disputation, we understand the term *spirit* to be
synonymous with *soul* in its general sense. Of so wide a signification
is this term, that even God is called “a spirit;” <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521.md) and a stormy blast of the air,
although it has material substance, is called by the psalmist the
“spirit” of a tempest. <span id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522.md) For
all these reasons, therefore, you will no longer deny that what is the
soul is called also spirit; I have, I think, adduced enough from the
pages of Holy Scripture to secure your assent in passages where the soul
of the very brute beast, which has no understanding, is designated
spirit. If, then, you take and wisely consider what has been advanced in
our discussion about the incorporeity of the soul, there is no further
reason why you should take offence at my having said that I was sure the
soul was not body, but spirit,—both because it is proved to be not
corporeal, and because in its general sense it is denominated spirit.
