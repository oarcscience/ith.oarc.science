<span id="xxi.iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—It is God’s Grace Both that Man
Comes to Him, and that Man Does Not Depart from Him.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xvi-p2"></span>This grace He placed “in Him in whom we
have obtained a lot, being predestinated according to the purpose of Him
who worketh all things.” <span id="fr_3587"></span>[3588](#fn_3587.md) And
thus as He worketh that we come to Him, so He worketh that we do not
depart. Wherefore it was said to Him by the mouth of the prophet, “Let
Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, and upon the Son of man whom
Thou madest strong for Thyself, and we will not depart from Thee.” <span
id="fr_3588"></span>[3589](#fn_3588.md) This certainly is not the first
Adam, in whom we departed from Him, but the second Adam, upon whom His
hand is placed, so that we do not depart from Him. For Christ altogether
with His members is—for the Church’s sake, which is His body—the fulness
of Him. When, therefore, God’s hand is upon Him, that we depart not from
God, assuredly God’s work reaches to us (for this is God’s hand); by
which work of God we are caused to be abiding in Christ with God—not, as
in Adam, departing from God. For “in Christ we have obtained a lot,
being predestinated according to His purpose who worketh all things.”
This, therefore, is God’s hand, not ours, that we depart not from God.
That, I say, is His hand who said, “I will put my fear in their hearts,
that they depart not from me.” <span
