<span id="xvii.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—The Meaning of “Breath” In
Scripture.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xix-p2"></span>The term, however, that is used in the
Greek version, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvii.iv.xix-p2.1"></span>πνοή</span>, is variously rendered in
Latin: sometimes by *flatus*, breath; sometimes by *spiritus*, spirit;
sometimes by *inspiratio*, inspiration. This term occurs in the Greek
editions of the passage which we are now reviewing, “Who giveth breath
to the people upon it,” the word for *breath* being <span
class="Greek"><span id="xvii.iv.xix-p2.2"></span>πνοή</span>.  <span
id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) The same word is used in the
narrative where man was endued with life: “And God breathed upon his
face the breath of life.” <span id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md)
Again, in the psalm the same term occurs: “Let every thing that hath
spirit praise the Lord.” <span id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) It
is the same word also in the Book of Job: “The inspiration of the
Almighty is that which teaches.” <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) The translator refused the word
*flatus*, breath, for *adspiratio*, inspiration, although he had before
him the very term <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvii.iv.xix-p6.2"></span>πνοή</span>, which occurs in the text of
the prophet which we are considering. We can hardly doubt, I think, that
in this passage of Job the Holy Ghost is signified. The question
discussed was concerning wisdom, whence it comes to men: “It cometh not
from number of years; but the Spirit is in mortals, and the inspiration
of the Almighty is that which teaches.” <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) By this repetition of terms it may
be quite understood that he did not speak of man’s own spirit in the
clause, “The Spirit is in mortals.” He wanted to show whence men have
wisdom,—that it is not from their own selves; so by using a duplicate
expression he explains his idea; “The inspiration of the Almighty is
that which teaches.” Similarly, in another passage of the same book, he
says, “The understanding of my lips shall meditate purity. The divine
Spirit is that which formed me, and the breath of the Almighty is that
which teacheth me.” <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) Here,
likewise, what he calls *adspiratio*, or “inspiration,” is in Greek
<span class="Greek"><span id="xvii.iv.xix-p8.3"></span>πνοή</span>, the
same word which is translated *flatus*, “breath,” in the passage quoted
from the prophet. Therefore, although it is rash to deny that the
passage, “Who giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them
that walk over it,” has reference to the soul or spirit of man,—although
the Holy Ghost may with greater credibility be understood as referred to
in the passage: yet I ask on what ground anybody can boldly determine
that the prophet meant in these words to intimate that the soul or
spirit whereby our nature possesses vitality \[is not given to us by God
through the process of propagation?\] <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) Of course if the prophet had very
plainly said, “Who giveth soul to the people upon earth,” it still would
remain to be asked whether God Himself gives it from an origin in the
preceding generation, just as He gives the body out of such prior
material, and that not only to men or cattle, but also to the seed of
corn, or to any other body whatever, just as it pleases Him; or whether
He bestows it by inbreathing as a new gift to each individual, as the
first man received it from Him?
