<span id="xv.iii.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48 \[XLIV\].—Ambrose is Not in
Agreement with Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xlviii-p2"></span>I wish, indeed, that he would listen
to the venerable bishop when, in the second book of his *Exposition of
the Gospel according to Luke,* <span
id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895) he expressly teaches us that the
Lord co-operates also with our wills. “You see, therefore,” says he,
“because the power of the Lord co-operates everywhere with human
efforts, that no man is able to build without the Lord, no man to watch
without the Lord, no man to undertake anything without the Lord. Whence
the apostle thus enjoins: ‘Whether ye eat, or whether ye drink, do all
to the glory of God.’” <span id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896) You
observe how the holy Ambrose takes away from men even their familiar
expressions,—such as, “We undertake, but God accomplishes,”—when he says
here that “no man is able to undertake anything without the Lord.” To
the same effect he says, in the sixth book of the same work, <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897) treating of the two debtors of a
certain creditor: “According to men’s opinions, he perhaps is the
greater offender who owed most. The case, however, is altered by the
Lord’s mercy, so that he loves the most who owes the most, if he yet
obtains grace.” See how the catholic doctor most plainly declares that
the very love which prompts every <span id="page_233">p. 233</span>
<span id="xv.iii.xlviii-Page_233"></span>man to an ampler love
appertains to the kindly gift of grace.
