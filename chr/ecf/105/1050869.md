<span id="xviii.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Scriptural Confirmation of the
Catholic Doctrine.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.iii-p2"></span>This is what we say; this is that about
which they object to us that we say “that the law was so given as to be
a cause of greater sin.” They do not hear the apostle saying, “For the
law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no
transgression;” <span id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683) and, “The law
was added for the sake of transgression until the seed should come to
whom the promise was made;” <span id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684)
and, “If there had been a law given which could have given life,
righteousness should altogether have been by the law; but the Scripture
hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ
might be given to them that believe.” <span
id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685) Hence it is that the Old Testament,
from the Mount Sinai, where the law was given, gendereth to bondage,
which is Agar. “Now we,” says he, “are not children of the bondmaid but
of the freewoman.” <span id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686) Therefore
they are not children of the freewoman who have accepted the law of the
letter, whereby they can be shown to be not only sinners, but moreover
transgressors; but they who have received the Spirit of grace, whereby
the law itself, holy and just and good, may be fulfilled. This is what
we say: let them attend and not contend; let them seek enlightenment and
not bring false accusations.
