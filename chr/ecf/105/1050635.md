<span id="xvi.vi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XIV.\]—Augustin’s Answer to
This Argument. Its Dealing with Scripture.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxix-p2"></span>Now to this lengthy statement of his we
have to say in answer, that, in the passages which he has quoted from
the sacred writings, there is nothing said about that shameful lust,
which we say did not exist in the body of our first parents in their
blessedness, when they were naked and were not ashamed. <span
id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257) The first passage from the apostle
was spoken of the seeds of corn, which first die in order to be
quickened. For some reason or other, he was unwilling to complete the
verse for his quotation. All he adduces from it is: “Thou fool, that
which thou sowest is not quickened;” but the apostle adds, “except it
die.” <span id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258) This writer, however,
so far as I can judge, wished this passage, which treats only of corn
seeds, to be understood of human seed, by such as read it without either
understanding the Holy Scriptures or recollecting them. Indeed, he not
merely curtailed this particular sentence, by omitting the clause,
“except it die,” but he omitted the following words, in which the
apostle explained of what seeds he was speaking; for the apostle adds:
“And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body which shall be,
but the bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other
grain.” <span id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259) This he omitted, and
closed up his context with what the apostle then writes: “But God giveth
it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed its own body;” just
as if the apostle spoke of man in cohabitation when he said, “Thou fool,
that which thou sowest is not quickened,” with a view to our
understanding of human seed, that it is quickened by God, not by man in
cohabitation begetting children. For he had previously said: “Sexual
pleasure does not complete the entire process of man’s making, but
rather presents to God, out of the treasures of nature, material with
which He vouchsafes to make the human being.” <span
id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260) He then added the quotation, as if
the apostle affirmed as follows: Thou fool, that which thou sowest is
not quickened,—quickened, that is, by thyself; but God forms the human
being out of thy seed. As if the apostle had not said the intermediate
words, which this writer chose to pass over; and as if the apostle’s aim
was to speak of human seed thus: “Thou fool, that which thou sowest is
not quickened; but God giveth to the seed a body such as pleaseth Him,
and to every seed its own body.” Indeed, after the apostle’s words, he
introduces remarks of his own to this effect: “If, therefore, God has
assigned to human seed, as to everything else, its own proper body,
which no wise or pious man will deny;” quite as if the apostle in the
passage in question spoke of human seed.
