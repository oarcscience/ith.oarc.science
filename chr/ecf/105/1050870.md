<span id="xviii.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 \[III.\]—Misrepresentation
Concerning the Effect of Baptism.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.iv-p2"></span>“They assert,” say they, “that baptism,
moreover, does not make men new—that is, does not give complete
remission of sins; but they contend that they are partly made children
of God and partly remain children of the world, that is, of the devil.”
They deceive; they lay traps; they shuffle; we do not say this. For we
say that all men who are children of the devil are also children of the
world; but not that all children of the world are also children of the
devil. Far be it from us to say that the holy fathers Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, and others of this kind, were children of the devil when they
were begetting in marriage, and those believers who until now and still
hereafter continue to beget. And yet we cannot contradict the Lord when
He says, “The children of this world marry and give in marriage.” <span
id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687) Some, therefore, are children of
this world, and yet are not children of the devil. For although the
devil is the author and source of all sins, yet it is not every sin that
makes children of the devil; for the children of God also sin, since if
they say they have no sins they deceive themselves, and the truth is not
in them. <span id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688) But they sin in
virtue of that condition by which they are still children of this world;
but by that grace wherewith they are the children of God they certainly
sin not, because every one that is born of God sinneth not. <span
id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689) But unbelief makes children of the
devil; and unbelief is specially called sin, as if it were the only one,
if it is not expressed what is the nature of the sin. As when the
“apostle” is spoken of, if it be not expressed what apostle, none is
understood but Paul; because he is better known by his many epistles,
and he laboured more than they all. For which reason, in what the Lord
said of the Holy Spirit, “He shall convict the world of sin,” <span
id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690) He meant unbelief to be understood;
for He said this when He was explaining, “Of sin because they believed
not on me,” <span id="fr_2691"></span>[2692](#fn_2691) and when He says,
“If I had not come and spoken to them, they should not have sin.” <span
id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692) For He meant not that before they
had no sin, but He wished to indicate that very want of faith by which
they did not believe Him even when He was present to them and speaking
to them; since they belonged to him of whom the apostle says, “According
to the prince of the power of the air, who now worketh in the children
of unbelief.” <span id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693) Therefore they
in whom there is not faith are the children of the devil, because they
have not in the inner man any reason why there should be forgiven them
whatever is committed either by human infirmity, or by ignorance, or by
any evil will whatever. But those are the children of God who certainly,
if they should “say that they have no sin, deceive themselves, and the
truth is not in them, but immediately” (as it continues) “when they
confess their sins” (which the children of the devil do not do, or do
not do according to the faith which is peculiar to the children of God),
“He is faithful and just to forgive them their sins, and to cleanse them
from all unrighteousness.” <span id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694)
And in order that what we say may be more fully understood, let Jesus
Himself be heard, who certainly was speaking to the children of God when
He said: “And if ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your
children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good
things to them that ask Him.” <span id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695)
For if these were not the children of God, He would not say to them,
“Your Father which is in heaven.” And yet He says that they are evil,
and that they know how to give good gifts to their children. Are they,
then, evil in that they are the children of God? Away with the thought!
But they are thence evil be<span id="page_404">p. 404</span> <span
id="xviii.v.iv-Page_404"></span>cause they are still the children of
this world, although now made children of God by the pledge of the Holy
Spirit.
