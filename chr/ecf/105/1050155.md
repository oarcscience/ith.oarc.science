<span id="x.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Why Pelagius Does Not Speak in His
Own Person.</span>

<span id="x.v.vi-p2"></span>Pray, don’t you see how Pelagius has
inserted the whole of this paragraph in his writings, not in his own
person, but in that of others, knowing so well the novelty of this
unheard-of doctrine, which is now beginning to raise its voice against
the ancient ingrafted opinion of the Church, that he was ashamed or
afraid to acknowledge it himself? And perhaps he does not himself think
that a man is born without sin for whom he confesses that baptism to be
necessary by which comes the remission of sins; or that the man is
condemned without sin who must be reckoned, when unbaptized, in the
class of non-believers, since the gospel of course cannot deceive us,
when it most clearly asserts, “He that believeth not shall be
damned;” <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) or, lastly, that the
image of God, when without sin, is not admitted into the kingdom of God,
forasmuch as “except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God,” <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md)
—and so must either be precipitated into eternal death without sin, or,
what is still more absurd, must have eternal life outside the kingdom of
God; for the Lord, when foretelling what He should say to His people at
last,—“Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the beginning of the world,” <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) —also clearly indicated what the
kingdom was of which He was speaking, by concluding thus: “So these
shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life
eternal.” <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) These opinions, then,
and others which spring from the central error, I believe so worthy a
man, and so good a Christian, does not at all accept, as being too
perverse and repugnant to Christian truth. But it is quite possible that
he may, by the very arguments of those who deny the transmission of sin,
be still so far distressed as to be anxious to hear or know what can be
said in reply to them; and on this account he was both unwilling to keep
silent the tenets propounded by them who deny the transmission of sin,
in order that he might get the question in due time discussed, and, at
the same time, declined to report the opinions in his own person, lest
he should be supposed to entertain them himself.
