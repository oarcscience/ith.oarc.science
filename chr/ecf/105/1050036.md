<span id="x.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Only Christ Justifies.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xviii-p2"></span>“Therefore as by the offence of one
upon all men to condemnation, even so by the justification of One upon
all men unto justification of life.” <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) This “offence of one,” if we are bent
on “imitation,” can only be the devil’s offence. Since, however, it is
manifestly spoken in reference to Adam and not the devil, it follows
that we have no other alternative than to understand the principle of
natural propagation, and not that of imitation, to be here implied.
\[XIV.\] Now when he says in reference to Christ, “By the
*justification* of one,” he has more expressly stated our doctrine than
if he were to say, “By the *righteousness* of one;” inasmuch as he
mentions that justification whereby Christ justifies the ungodly, and
which he did not propose as an object of imitation, for He alone is
capable of effecting this. Now it was quite competent for the apostle to
say, and to say rightly: “Be ye imitators of me, as I also am of
Christ;” <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) but he could never say:
Be ye justified by me, as I also am by Christ;—since there may be, and
indeed actually are and have been, many who were righteous and worthy of
imitation; but no one is righteous and a justifier but Christ alone.
Whence it is said: “To the man that believeth on him that justifieth the
ungodly, his faith is counted <span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span
id="x.iii.xviii-Page_22"></span>for righteousness.” <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) Now if any man had it in his power
confidently to declare, “I justify you,” it would necessarily follow
that he could also say, “Believe in me.” But it has never been in the
power of any of the saints of God to say this except the Saint of
saints, <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) who said: “Ye believe in
God, believe also in me;” <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) so
that, inasmuch as it is He that justifies the ungodly, to the man who
believes in him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is imputed for
righteousness.
