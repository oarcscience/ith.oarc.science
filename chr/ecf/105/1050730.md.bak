id="xvii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22 \[XVI.\]—Peter’s Responsibility
in the Case of Victor.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.xxii-p2"></span>Far be it from you, my brother, that
such views should be pleasant to you, or that you should either feel
pleasure in having acquired them, or presume ever to teach them.
Otherwise, even he would be a far better man than yourself. Because at
the commencement of his first book he has prefixed the following modest
<span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="xvii.v.xxii-Page_342"></span>and humble preface: “Though I desire to
comply with your request, I am only affording a clear proof of my
presumption.” And a little further on he says, <span
id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433.md) “Inasmuch as I am, indeed, by no
means confident of being able to prove what I may have advanced; and
moreover I should always be anxious not to insist on any opinion of my
own, if it is found to be an improbable one; and it would be my hearty
desire, in case my own judgment is condemned, earnestly to follow better
and truer views. For as it shows evidence of the best intention, and a
laudable purpose, to permit yourself to be easily led to truer views of
a subject; so it betokens an obstinate and depraved mind to refuse to
turn quickly aside into the pathway of reason.” Now, as he said all this
sincerely, and still feels as he spoke, he no doubt entertains a very
hopeful feeling about a right issue. In similar strain he concludes his
second book: “You must not think,” says he, “that there is any chance of
its ever recoiling invidiously against you, that I constitute you the
judge of my words. And lest by chance the sharp eye of some inquisitive
reader may have opportunity of turning up and encountering any possible
vestiges of elemental error which may be left behind on my illegal
sheets, I beg you to tear up page after page with unsparing hand, if
need be; and after expending on me your critical censure, punish me
further, by smearing out the very ink which has given form to my
worthless words; so that, having your full opportunity, you may prevent
all ridicule, on the score either of the favourable opinion you so
strongly entertain of me, or of the inaccuracies which lurk in my
writings.”
