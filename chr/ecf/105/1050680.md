<span id="xvii.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8 \[VIII.\]—Victor’s Erroneous
Opinion, that the Soul Deserved to Become Sinful.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.viii-p2"></span>Vainly supposing, then, that he was
able to solve this question from the foreknowledge of God, he keeps
floundering on, and says: “If the soul deserved to be sinful which could
not have been sinful, yet neither did it remain in sin, because, as
prefigured in Christ, it was not bound to be in sin, even as it was
unable to be.” Now what can he mean when he says, “which could not have
been sinful,” or “was unable to be in sin,” except, as I suppose, this,
if it did not come into the flesh? For, of course, it could not have
been sinful through original sin, or have been at all involved in
original sin, except through the flesh, if it is not derived from the
parent. We see it, then, liberated from sin through grace, but we do not
see how it deserved to be involved in sin. What, then, is the meaning of
these words of his, “If the soul deserved to be sinful, yet neither did
it remain in sin”? For if I were to ask him, why it did not remain in
sin, he would very properly answer, Because the grace of Christ
delivered it therefrom. Since, then, he tells us how it came to pass
that an infant’s soul was liberated from its sinfulness, let him further
tell us how it happened that it deserved to be sinful.
