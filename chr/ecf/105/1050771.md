<span id="xvii.vii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15 \[XI.\]—We Must Not Be Wise
Above What is Written.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xv-p2"></span>But then, again, you are mistaken in
this matter; for the passages of Scripture which you chose to produce
for the solution of this question of yours, do not prove the point. For
it is another thing which they prove, without which we cannot really
lead a pious life, namely, that we have in God the giver, creator, and
fashioner of our souls. But how He does this for them, whether by
inbreathing them as new, or by deriving them from the parents, they do
not tell us—except in the instance of that one soul which He gave to the
first man. Read attentively what I have written to that servant of God,
our brother Renatus; <span id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md) for
inasmuch as I have pointed it all out to him there, it is not necessary
for me to repeat my proofs here. But you would like me to follow your
example in definiteness of theory, and so thrust myself into such
difficulties as you have surrounded yourself with. Involved in these,
you have spoken many stout words against the catholic faith; if,
however, you would faithfully and humbly bethink yourself and consider,
you would assuredly see how greatly it would have profited you, if you
had only known how to be natural and consistent in your ignorance; and
how this advantage is still open to you, if you were even now able to
maintain such propriety. Now, since understanding so pleases you in
man’s nature (for, truly enough, if our nature were without it, we
should not be different from brute beasts, so far as our souls are
concerned), understand, I beg of you, what it is that you do not
understand, lest you should understand nothing: and do not despise any
man who, in order that he may truly understand, understands that he does
not understand that which he does not understand. <span
id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474.md) With regard, however, to the
passage in the inspired psalm, “Man, being in honour, understandeth not;
he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like unto them;” <span
id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md) read and understand these words,
that you may rather with a humble spirit guard against the opprobrium
yourself, than arrogantly throw it out against another person. The
passage applies to those who regard only that as a life worth living
which they live in the flesh—having no hope after death—just like
“cattle;” it has no reference to those who never deny their <span
id="page_361">p. 361</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.xv-Page_361"></span>knowledge of what they actually know,
and always acknowledge their ignorance of what they really do not know;
who, in point of fact, are aware of their weakness, rather than
confident of their strength.

<span id="xvii.vii.xv-p4"></span> This repetition of one word for
rhetorical effect is characteristic of our author (as, before him, it
was of the Apostle Paul): “*Intellige* quid non *intelligas*, ne totum
non *intelligas*…qui ut veraciter *intelligat*, quod non *intelligit*
hoc se non *intelligere intelligit*.”
