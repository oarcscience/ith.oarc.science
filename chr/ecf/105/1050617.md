id="xvi.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[IV.\]—In What Manner the
Adversary’s Cavils Must Be Refuted.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xi-p2"></span>Let us now look at the rest of what he
has joined together in his selections. But what should be my course of
proceeding? Ought I to set forth every passage of his for the purpose of
answering it, or, omitting everything which the catholic faith contains,
as not in dispute between us, only handle and confute those statements
in which he strays away from the beaten path of truth, and endeavours to
graft on catholic stems the poisonous shoots of his Pelagian heresy?
This is, no doubt, the easier course. But I suppose I must not lose
sight of a possible contingency, that any one, after reading my book,
without perusing all that has been alleged by him, may think that I was
unwilling to bring forward the passages on which his allegations depend,
and by which are shown to be truly deduced the statements which I am
controverting as false. I <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.xi-Page_287"></span>should be glad, therefore, if the reader
will without exception kindly observe and consider the two classes of
contributions which occur in this little work of ours—that is to say,
all that he has alleged, and the answers which on my side I give him.
