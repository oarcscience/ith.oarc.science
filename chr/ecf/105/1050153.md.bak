<span id="x.v.iv-p2"></span>To the other points which Pelagius makes
them urge who argue against original sin, I have already, I think,
sufficiently and clearly replied in the two former books of my lengthy
treatise. Now if my reply should seem to any persons to be brief or
obscure, I beg their pardon, and request the favour of their coming to
terms with those who perhaps censure my treatise, not for being too
brief, but rather as being too long; whilst any who still do not
understand the points which I cannot help thinking I have explained as
clearly as the nature of the subject allowed me, shall certainly hear no
blame or reproach from me for indifference, or want of understanding
me. <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) I would rather that they
should pray God to give them intelligence.
