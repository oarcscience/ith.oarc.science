<span id="xxi.ii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—The Book of Wisdom Obtains in
the Church the Authority of Canonical Scripture.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>And since these things are so, the
judgment of the book of Wisdom ought not to be repudiated, since for so
long a course of years that book has deserved to be read in the Church
of Christ from the station of the readers of the Church of Christ, and
to be heard by all Christians, from bishops downwards, even to the
lowest lay believers, penitents, and catechumens, with the veneration
paid to divine authority. For assuredly, if, from those who have been
before me in commenting on the divine Scriptures, I should bring forward
a defence of this judgment, which we are now called upon to defend more
carefully and copiously than usual against the new error of the
Pelagians,—that is, that God’s grace is not given according to our
merits, and that it is given freely to whom it is given, because it is
neither of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy; but that by righteous judgment it is not given to whom it
is not given, because there is no unrighteousness with God;—if,
therefore, I should put forth a defence of this opinion from catholic
commentators on the divine oracles who have preceded us, assuredly these
brethren for whose sake I am now discoursing would acquiesce, for this
you have intimated in your letters. What need is there, then, for us to
look into the writings of those who, before this heresy sprang up, had
no necessity to be conversant in a question so difficult of solution as
this, which beyond a doubt they would have done if they had been
compelled to answer such things? Whence it arose that they touched upon
what they thought of God’s grace briefly in some passages of their
writings, and cursorily; but on those matters which they argued against
the enemies of the Church, and in exhortations to every virtue by which
to serve the living and true God for the purpose of attaining eternal
life and true happiness, they dwelt at length. But the grace of God,
what it could do, shows itself artlessly by its frequent mention in
prayers; for what God commands to be done would not be asked for from
God, unless it could be given by Him that it should be done.
