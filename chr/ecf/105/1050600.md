<span id="xvi.v.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35 \[XXXI.\]—The Flesh, Carnal
Affection.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxv-p2"></span>But we have in the apostle’s own
language, a little before, a sufficiently clear proof that he might have
meant his flesh when he said, “Bringing *me* into captivity.” For after
declaring, “I know that *in me* dwelleth no good thing,” he at once
added an explanatory sentence to this effect, “That is,*in my
flesh*.” <span id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175) It is then the
flesh, in which there dwells nothing good, that is brought into
captivity to the law of sin. Now he designates that as the flesh wherein
lies a certain morbid carnal affection, not the mere conformation of our
bodily fabric whose members are not to be used as weapons for sin—that
is, for that very concupiscence which holds this flesh of ours captive.
So far, indeed, as concerns this actual bodily substance and nature of
ours, it is already God’s temple in all faithful men, whether living in
marriage or in continence. If, however, absolutely nothing of our flesh
were in captivity, not even to the devil, because there has accrued to
it the remission of sin, that sin be not imputed to it (and this is
properly designated the law of sin); yet if under this law of sin, that
is, under its own concupiscence, our flesh were not to some degree held
captive, how could that be true which the apostle states, when he speaks
of our “waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our
body”? <span id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176) In so far, then, as
there is now this waiting for the redemption of our body, there is also
in some degree still existing something in us which is a captive to the
law of sin. Accordingly he exclaims, “O wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177) What
are we to understand by such language, but that our body, which is
undergoing corruption, weighs heavily on our soul? When, therefore, this
very body of ours shall be restored to us in an incorrupt state, there
shall be a full liberation from the body of this death; but there will
be no such deliverance for them who shall rise again to condemnation. To
the body of this death then is <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="xvi.v.xxxv-Page_278"></span>understood to be owing the circumstance
that there is in our members another law which wars against the law of
the mind, so long as the flesh lusts against the spirit—without,
however, subjugating the mind, inasmuch as on its side, too, the spirit
has a concupiscence contrary to the flesh. <span
id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178) Thus, although the actual law of
sin partly holds the flesh in captivity (whence comes its resistance to
the law of the mind), still it has not an absolute empire in our body,
notwithstanding its mortal state, since it refuses obedience to its
desires. <span id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179) For in the case of
hostile armies between whom there is an earnest conflict, even the side
which is inferior in the fight usually holds a something which it has
captured; and although in some such way there is somewhat in our flesh
which is kept under the law of sin, yet it has before it the hope of
redemption: and then there will remain not a particle of this corrupt
concupiscence; but our flesh, healed of that diseased plague, and wholly
clad in immortality, shall live for evermore in eternal blessedness.
