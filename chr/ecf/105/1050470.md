<span id="xv.iii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15 \[XIV.\]—He Who Has Been Taught by
Grace Actually Comes to Christ.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xv-p2"></span>Now as touching this kind of teaching,
the Lord also says: “Every man that hath heard, and hath learned of the
Father, cometh unto me.” <span id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) Of
the man, therefore, who has not come, it cannot be correctly said: “Has
heard and has learned that it is his duty to come to Him, but he is not
willing to do what he has learned.” It is indeed absolutely improper to
apply such a statement to that method of teaching, whereby God teaches
by grace. For if, as the Truth says, “Every man that hath learned
cometh,” it follows, of course, that whoever does not come has not
learned. But who can fail to see that a man’s coming or not coming is by
the determination of his will? This determination, however, may stand
alone, if the man does not come; but if he does come, it cannot be
without assistance; and such assistance, that he not only knows what it
is he ought to do, but also actually does what he thus knows. And thus,
when God teaches, it is not by the letter of the law, but by the grace
of the Spirit. Moreover, He so teaches, that whatever a man learns, he
not only sees with his perception, but also desires with his choice, and
accomplishes in action. By this mode, therefore, of divine instruction,
volition itself, and performance itself, are assisted, and not merely
the natural “capacity” of willing and performing. For if nothing but
this “capacity” of ours were assisted by this grace, the Lord would
rather have said, “Every man that hath heard and hath learned of the
Father *may possibly* come unto me.” This, however, is not what He said;
but His words are these: “Every man that hath heard and hath learned of
the Father *cometh* unto me.” Now *the possibility of coming* Pelagius
places in nature, or even—as we found him attempting to say some time
ago <span id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819.md) —in grace (whatever that
may mean according to him),—when he says, “whereby this very capacity is
assisted;” whereas *the actual coming* lies in the will and act. It does
not, however, follow that he who *may* come actually comes, unless he
has also willed and acted for the coming. But every one who has learned
of the Father not only has the possibility of coming, but *comes;* and
in this result are already included the *motion* of the capacity, the
*affection* of the will, and the *effect* of the action. <span
