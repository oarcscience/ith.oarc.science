id="xvii.vii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—Concluding
Admonition.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxxix-p2"></span>If, as may possibly be the case, you
desire to know whether there are many other points which appear to me to
require emendation in your books, it cannot be troublesome for you to
come to me,—not, indeed, as a scholar to his master, but as a person in
his prime to one full of years, and as a strong man to a weak one. And
although you ought not to have published your books, still there is a
greater and a truer glory in a man’s being censured, when he confesses
with his own lips the justice of his correction, than in being lauded
out of the mouth of any defender of error. Now, while I should be
unwilling to believe that all those who listened to your reading of the
afore-mentioned books, and lavished their praises on you, had either
previously held for themselves the opinions which sound doctrine
disapproves of, or were induced by you to entertain them, I still cannot
help thinking that they had the keenness of their mind blunted by the
impetuous and constant flow of your elocution, and so were unable to
bestow adequate attention on the contents of your discourse; or else,
that when they were in any case capable of understanding what you said,
it was less for any very clear statement of the truth that they praised
you than for the affluence of your language, and the facility and
resources of your mental powers. For praise, and fame, and kindly regard
are very commonly bestowed on a young man’s eloquence in anticipation of
the future, though as yet it lacks the mellowed perfection and fidelity
of a fully-informed instructor. In order, then, that you may attain to
true wisdom yourself, and that what you say may be able not only to
delight, but even edify other people, it behoves you, after removing
from your mind the dangerous applause of others, to keep conscientious
watch over your own words.
