<span id="x.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—The Ambiguity of “Adam is the Figure
of Him to Come.”</span>

<span id="x.v.ix-p2"></span>To me, however, no doubt presents itself
about the whole of this passage, in which the apostle speaks of the
condemnation of many through the sin of one, and the justification of
many through the righteousness of One, except as to the words, “Adam is
the figure of Him that was to come.” <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) For this phrase in reality not only
suits the sense which understands that Adam’s posterity were to be born
of the same form as himself along with sin, but the words are also
capable of being drawn out into several distinct meanings. For we have
ourselves perhaps actually contended for various senses from the words
in question at different times, <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md)
and very likely we shall propound yet another view, which, however, will
not be incompatible with the sense here mentioned; and even Pelagius has
not always expounded the passage in one way. All the rest, however, of
the passage in which these doubtful words occur, if its statements are
carefully examined and treated, as I have tried my best to do in the
first book of this treatise, will not (in spite of the obscurity of
style necessarily engendered by the subject itself) fail to show the
incompatibility of any other meaning than that which has secured the
adhesion of the universal Church from the earliest times—that believing
infants have obtained through the baptism of Christ the remission of
original sin.
