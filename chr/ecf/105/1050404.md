<span id="xiv.xxiii-p2"></span>Now it so happened that, while we were
reading this defence of Pelagius in the small paper which we received at
first, <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653) there were present
certain holy brethren, who said that they had in their possession some
hortatory or consolatory works which Pelagius had addressed to a widow
lady whose name did not appear, and they advised us to examine whether
the words which he had abjured for his own occurred anywhere in these
books. They were not themselves aware whether they did or not. The said
books were accordingly read through, and the words in question were
actually discovered in them. Moreover, they who had produced the copy of
the book, affirmed that for now almost four years they had had these
books as Pelagius’, nor had they once heard a doubt expressed about his
authorship. Considering, then, from the integrity of these servants of
God, which was very well known to us, how impossible it was for them to
use deceit in the matter, the conclusion seemed inevitable, that
Pelagius must be supposed by us to have rather been the deceiver at his
trial before the bishops; unless we should think it possible that
something may have been published, even for so many years, in his name,
although not actually composed by him; for our informants did not tell
us that they had received the books from Pelagius himself, nor had they
ever heard him admit his own authorship. Now, in my own case, certain of
our brethren have told me that sundry writings have found their way into
Spain under my name. Such persons, indeed, as had read my genuine
writings could not recognise those others as mine; although by other
persons my authorship of them was quite believed.
