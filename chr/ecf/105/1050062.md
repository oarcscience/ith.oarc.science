<span id="x.iii.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—From the Epistles to the
Corinthians.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xliv-p2"></span>Likewise to the Corinthians he says:
“For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how
that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.” <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) Again, in his Second Epistle to these
Corinthians: “For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus
judge, that if One died for all, then all died: and for all did Christ
die, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but
unto Him which died for them, and rose again. Wherefore, henceforth know
we no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the
flesh, yet from henceforth know we Him so no more. Therefore if any man
be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold,
all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath
reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given unto us the
ministry of reconciliation. To what effect? That God was in Christ,
reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
them, and putting on us the ministry of reconciliation. Now then are we
ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you
in Christ’s stead, to be reconciled to God. For He hath made Him to be
sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might become the righteousness of
God in Him. <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) We then, as workers
together with Him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God
in vain. (For He saith, I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in
the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the
acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)” <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) Now, if infants are not embraced
within this reconciliation and salvation, who wants them for the baptism
of Christ? But if they are embraced, then are they reckoned as among the
dead for whom He died; nor can they be possibly reconciled and saved by
Him, unless He remit and impute not unto them their sins.
