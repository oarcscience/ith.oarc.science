<span id="xxi.ii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—To Believe is to Think with
Assent.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.v-p2"></span>And, therefore, commending that grace
which is not given according to any merits, but is the cause of all good
merits, he says, “Not that we are sufficient to think anything as of
ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.” <span
id="fr_3427"></span>[3428](#fn_3427) Let them give attention to this,
and well weigh these words, who think that the beginning of faith is of
ourselves, and the supplement of faith is of God. For who cannot see
that thinking is prior to believing? For no one believes anything unless
he has first thought that it is to be believed. For however suddenly,
however rapidly, some thoughts fly before the will to believe, and this
presently follows in such wise as to attend them, as it were, in closest
conjunction, it is yet necessary that everything which is believed
should be believed after thought has preceded; although even belief
itself is nothing else than to think with assent. For it is not every
one who thinks that believes, since many think in order that they may
not believe; but everybody who believes, thinks,—both thinks in
believing and believes in thinking. Therefore in what pertains to
religion and piety (of which the apostle was speaking), if we are not
capable of thinking anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is
<span id="page_500">p. 500</span> <span id="xxi.ii.v-Page_500"></span>of
God, we are certainly not capable of believing anything as of ourselves,
since we cannot do this without thinking; but our sufficiency, by which
we begin to believe, is of God. Wherefore, as no one is sufficient for
himself, for the beginning or the completion of any good work
whatever,—and this those brethren of yours, as what you have written
intimates, already agree to be true, whence, as well in the beginning as
in the carrying out of every good work, our sufficiency is of God,—so no
one is sufficient for himself, either to begin or to perfect faith; but
our sufficiency is of God. Because if faith is not a matter of thought,
it is of no account; and we are not sufficient to think anything as of
ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.
