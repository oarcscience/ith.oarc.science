id="xxi.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Infants are Not Judged
According to that Which They are Foreknown as Likely to Do If They
Should Live.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span>For you see, beloved, how absurd it
is, and how foreign from soundness of faith and sincerity of truth, for
us to say that infants, when they die, should be judged according to
those things which they are foreknown to be going to do if they should
live. For to this opinion, from which certainly every human feeling, on
however little reason it may be founded, and especially every Christian
feeling, revolts, they are compelled to advance who have chosen in such
wise to be withdrawn from the error of the Pelagians as still to think
that they must believe, and, moreover, must profess in argument, that
the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, by which alone after
the fall of the first man, in whom we all fell, help is afforded to us,
is given according to our merits. And this belief Pelagius himself,
before the Eastern bishops as judges, condemned in fear of his own
condemnation. And if this be not said of the good or bad works of those
who have died, which they would have done if they had lived,—and thus of
no works, and works that would never exist, even in the foreknowledge of
God,—if this, therefore, be not said, and you see under how great a
mistake it is said, what will remain but that we confess, when the
darkness of contention is removed, that the grace of God is not given
according to our merits, which position the catholic Church defends
against the Pelagian heresy; and that we see this in more evident truth
especially in infants? For God is not compelled by fate to come to the
help of these infants, and not to come to the help of those,—since the
case is alike to both. Or shall we think that human affairs in the case
of infants are not managed by Divine Providence, but by fortuitous
chances, when rational souls are either to be condemned or delivered,
although, indeed, not a sparrow falls to the ground without the will of
our Father which is in heaven? <span
id="fr_3623"></span>[3624](#fn_3623.md) Or must we so attribute it to the
negligence of parents that infants die without baptism, as that heavenly
judgments have nothing to do with it; as if they themselves who in this
way die badly had of their own will chosen the negligent parents for
themselves of whom they were born? What shall I say when an infant
expires some time before he can possibly be advantaged by the ministry
of baptism? For often when the parents are eager and the ministers
prepared for giving baptism to the infants, it still is not given,
because God does not choose; since He has not kept it in this life for a
little while in order that baptism might be given it. What, moreover,
when sometimes aid could be afforded by baptism to the children of
unbelievers, that they should not go into perdition, and could not be
afforded to the children of believers? In which case it is certainly
shown that there is no acceptance of persons with God; otherwise He
would rather deliver the children of His worshippers than the children
of His enemies.
