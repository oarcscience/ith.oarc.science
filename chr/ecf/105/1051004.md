<span id="xx.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20 \[IX.\]—Some are Children of God
According to Grace Temporally Received, Some According to God’s Eternal
Foreknowledge.</span>

<span id="xx.xxiii-p2"></span>Nor let it disturb us that to some of His
children God does not give this perseverance. Be this far from being so,
however, if these were of those who are predestinated and called
according to His purpose,—who are truly the children of the promise. For
the former, while they live piously, are called children of God; but
because they will live wickedly, and die in that impiety, the
foreknowledge of God does not call them God’s children. For they are
children of God whom as yet we have not, and God has already, of whom
the Evangelist John says, “that Jesus should die for that nation, and
not for that nation only, but that also He should gather together in one
the children of God which were scattered abroad;” <span
id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312.md) and this certainly they were to
become by believing, through the preaching of the gospel. And yet before
this had happened they had already been enrolled as sons of God with
unchangeable stedfastness in the memorial of their Father. And, again,
there are some who are called by us children of God on account of grace
received even in temporal things, yet are not so called by God; of whom
the same John says, “They went out from us, but they were not of us,
because if they had been of us they would, no doubt, have continued with
us.” <span id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313.md) He does not say, “They
went out from us, but because they did not abide with us they are no
longer now of us;” but he says, “They went out from us, but they were
not of us,”—that is to say, even when they appeared among us, they were
not of us. And as if it were said to him, <span id="page_480">p.
480</span> <span id="xx.xxiii-Page_480"></span>Whence do you prove this?
he says, “Because if they had been of us, they would assuredly have
continued with us.” <span id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314.md) It is the
word of God’s children; John is the speaker, who was ordained to a chief
place among the children of God. When, therefore, God’s children say of
those who had not perseverance, “They went out from us, but they were
not of us,” and add, “Because if they had been of us, they would
assuredly have continued with us,” what else do they say than that they
were not children, even when they were in the profession and name of
children? Not because they simulated righteousness, but because they did
not continue in it. For he does not say, “For if they had been of us,
they would assuredly have maintained a real and not a feigned
righteousness with us;” but he says, “If they had been of us, they would
assuredly have continued with us.” Beyond a doubt, he wished them to
continue in goodness. Therefore they were in goodness; but because they
did not abide in it,—that is, they did not persevere unto the end,—he
says, They were not of us, even when they were with us,—that is, they
were not of the number of children, even when they were in the faith of
children; because they who are truly children are foreknown and
predestinated as conformed to the image of His Son, and are called
according to His purpose, so as to be elected. For the son of promise
does not perish, but the son of perdition. <span
