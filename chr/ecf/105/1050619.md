<span id="xvi.vi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—Eve’s Name Means Life, and is a
Great Sacrament of the Church.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xiii-p2"></span>Now, observe the rest of the passage in
which he thinks he finds, to our prejudice, what is consonant with the
above-quoted title. “God,” says he, “who had framed Adam out of the dust
of the ground, formed Eve out of his rib, <span
id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md) and said, She shall be called Life,
because she is the mother of all who live.” Well now, it is not so
written. But what matters that to us? For it constantly happens that our
memory fails in verbal accuracy, while the sense is still maintained.
Nor was it God, but her husband, who gave Eve her name, which should
signify *Life*; for thus it is written: “And Adam called his wife’s name
Life, because she is the mother of all living.” <span
id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218.md) But very likely he might have
understood the Scripture as testifying that God gave Eve this name
through Adam, as His prophet. For in that she was called Life, and the
mother of all living, there lies a great sacrament of the Church, of
which it would detain us long to speak, and which is unnecessary to our
present undertaking. The very same thing which the apostle says, “This
is a great sacrament: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church,” was
also spoken by Adam when he said, “For this cause shall a man leave his
father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they twain
shall be one flesh.” <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219.md) The Lord
Jesus, however, in the Gospel mentions God as having said this of Eve;
and the reason, no doubt, is, that God declared through the man what the
man, in fact, uttered as a prophecy. Now, observe what follows in the
paper of extracts: “By that primitive name,” says he, “He showed for
what labour the woman had been provided; and He said accordingly, ‘Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.’” <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220.md) Now, who amongst ourselves denies
that the woman was provided for the work of child-bearing by the Lord
God, the beneficent Creator of all good? See further what he goes on to
say: “God, therefore, who created them male and female, <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221.md) furnished them with members
suitable for procreation, and ordained that bodies should be produced
from bodies; and yet is security for their capacity for effecting the
work, executing all that exists with that power which He used in
creation.” <span id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222.md) Well, even this we
acknowledge to be catholic doctrine, as we also do with regard to the
passage which he immediately subjoins: “If, then, offspring comes only
through sex, and sex only through the body, and the body through God,
who can hesitate to allow that fecundity is rightly attributed to God?”

<span id="xvi.vi.xiii-p8"></span> For once a difficulty occurs (for
which, however, St. Augustin is not responsible) in the construction of
the original. The obscure passage is here translated in accordance with
a suggestion in some of the editions. It stands in the original thus:
“Quorum tamen efficientiæ potentiâ operationis intervenit omne quod est
eâ administrans virtute quâ condidit.” Some editors suggest “*potentia*”
(nominative) “*Dei operationis intervenit*;” but there is no <span
class="c16"><span id="xvi.vi.xiii-p8.1"></span> ms.</span> authority for
the *Dei*.
