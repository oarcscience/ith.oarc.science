<span id="xviii.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Man Does No Good Thing Which
God Does Not Cause Him to Do.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xxi-p2"></span>Wherefore God does many good things in
man which man does not do; but man does none which God does not cause
man to do. Accordingly, there would be no desire of good in man from the
Lord if it were not a good; but if it is a good, we have it not save
from Him who is supremely and incommunicably good. For what is the
desire for good but love, of which John the apostle speaks without any
ambiguity, and <span id="page_401">p. 401</span> <span
id="xviii.iv.xxi-Page_401"></span>says, “Love is of God”?  <span
id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664.md) Nor is its beginning of ourselves,
and its perfection of God; but if love is of God, we have the whole of
it from God. May God by all means turn away this folly of making
ourselves first in His gifts, Himself last,—because “His mercy shall
prevent me.” <span id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665.md) And it is He to
whom is faithfully and truthfully sung, “For Thou hast prevented him
with the blessings of sweetness.” <span
id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666.md) And what is here more fitly
understood than that very desire of good of which we are speaking? For
good begins then to be longed for when it has begun to grow sweet. But
when good is done by the fear of penalty, not by the love of
righteousness, good is not yet well done. Nor is that done in the heart
which seems to be done in the act when a man would rather not do it if
he could evade it with impunity. Therefore the “blessing of sweetness”
is God’s grace, by which is caused in us that what He prescribes to us
delights us, and we desire it,—that is, we love it; in which if God does
not precede us, not only is it not perfected, but it is not even begun,
from us. For, if without Him we are able to do nothing actually, we are
able neither to begin nor to perfect,—because to begin, it is said “His
mercy shall prevent me;” <span id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667.md) to
finish, it is said, “His mercy shall follow me.” <span
id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668.md)
