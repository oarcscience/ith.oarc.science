<span id="xi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Theirs is Comparatively a Harmless
Error, Who Say that a Man Lives Here Without Sin.</span>

<span id="xi.vi-p2"></span>They therefore are not a very dangerous set
of persons and they ought to be urged to show, if they are able, that
they are themselves such, who hold that man lives or has lived here
without any sin whatever. There are indeed passages of Scripture, in
which I apprehend it is definitely stated that no man who lives on
earth, although enjoying freedom of will, can be found without sin; as,
for instance, the place where it is written, “Enter not into judgment
with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be
justified.” <span id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) If, however, anybody
shall have succeeded in showing that this text and the other similar
ones ought to be taken in a different sense from their obvious one, and
shall have proved that some man or men have spent a sinless life on
earth,—whoever does not, not merely refrain from much opposing him, but
also does not rejoice with him to the full, is afflicted by
extraordinary goads of envy. Moreover, if there neither is, has been,
nor will be any man endowed with such perfection of purity (which I am
more inclined to believe), and yet it is firmly set forth and thought
there is or has been, or is to be,—so far as I can judge, no great error
is made, and certainly not a dangerous one, when a man is thus carried
away by a certain benevolent feeling; provided that he who thinks so
much of another, does not think himself to be such a being, unless he
has ascertained that he really and clearly is such.
