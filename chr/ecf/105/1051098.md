id="xxi.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[VIII.\]—Why is Not Grace
Given According to Merit?</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xviii-p2"></span>But “why,” says one, “is not the
grace of God given according to men’s merits?” I answer, Because God is
merciful. “Why, then,” it is asked, “is it not given to all?” And here I
reply, Because God is a Judge. <span
id="fr_3591"></span>[3592](#fn_3591.md) And thus grace is given by Him
freely; and by His righteous judgment it is shown in some what grace
confers on those to whom it is given. Let us not then be ungrateful,
that according to the good pleasure of His will a merciful God delivers
so many to the praise of the glory of His grace from such deserved
perdition; as, if He should deliver no one therefrom, He would not be
unrighteous. Let him, therefore, who is delivered love His grace. Let
him who is not delivered acknowledge his due. If, in remitting a debt,
goodness is perceived, in requiring it, justice—unrighteousness is never
found to be with God.
