id="xxi.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Why God Willed that He Should
Be Asked for that Which He Might Give Without Prayer.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xvii-p2"></span>Wherefore, also He willed that He
should be asked that we may not be led into temptation, because if we
are not led, we by no means depart from Him. And this might have been
given to us even without our praying for it, but by our prayer He willed
us to be admonished from whom we receive these benefits. For from whom
do we receive but from Him from whom it is right for us to ask? Truly in
this matter let not the Church look for laborious disputations, but
consider its own daily prayers. It prays that the unbelieving may
believe; therefore God converts to the faith. It prays that believers
may persevere; therefore God gives perseverance to the end. God foreknew
that He would do this. This is the very predestination of the saints,
“whom He has chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world, that
they should be holy and unspotted before Him in love; predestinating
them unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according
to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His
grace, in which He hath shown them favour in His beloved Son, in whom
they have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins
according to the riches of His grace, which has abounded towards them in
all wisdom and prudence; that He might show them the mystery of His will
according to His good pleasure which He hath purposed in Him, in the
dispensation of the fulness of times to restore all things in Christ
which are in heaven and which are in earth; in Him, in whom also we have
obtained a lot, being predestinated according to His purpose who worketh
all things.” <span id="fr_3590"></span>[3591](#fn_3590.md) Against a
trumpet of truth so clear as this, what man of sober and watchful faith
can receive any human arguments?
