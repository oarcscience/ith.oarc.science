id="xv.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Christ’s Incarnation Was of
Avail to the Fathers, Even Though It Had Not Yet Happened.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxi-p2"></span>By disputation of this sort, they
attempt to exclude the ancient saints from the grace of the Mediator, as
if the man Christ Jesus were not the Mediator between God and *those
men*; on the ground that, not having yet taken flesh of the Virgin’s
womb, He was not yet man at the time when those righteous men lived. If
this, however, were true, in vain would the apostle say: “By man came
death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all
die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” <span
id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985) For inasmuch as those ancient
saints, according to the vain conceits of these men, found their nature
self-sufficient, and required not the man Christ to be their Mediator to
reconcile them to God, so neither shall they be made alive in Him, to
whose body they are shown not to belong as members, according to the
statement that it was on man’s account that He became man. If, however,
as the Truth says through His apostles, even as all die in Adam, even so
shall all be made alive in Christ; forasmuch as the resurrection of the
dead comes through the one man, even as death comes through the other
man; what Christian man can be bold enough to doubt that even those
righteous men who pleased God in the more remote periods of the human
race are destined to attain to the resurrection of eternal life, and not
eternal death, because they shall be made alive in Christ? that they are
made alive in Christ, because they belong to the body of Christ? that
they belong to the body of Christ, because Christ is the head even to
them? <span id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986) and that Christ is the
head even to them, because there is but one Mediator between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus? But this He could not have been to them,
unless through His grace they had believed in His resurrection. And how
could they have done this, if they had been ignorant that He was to come
in the flesh, and if they had not by this faith lived justly and
piously? Now, if the incarnation of Christ could be of no concern to
them, on the ground that it had not yet come about, it must follow that
Christ’s judgment can be of no concern to us, because it has not yet
taken place. But if we shall stand at the right hand of Christ through
our faith in His judgment, which has not yet transpired, but is to come
to pass, it follows that those ancient saints are members of Christ
through their faith in His resurrection, which had not in their day
happened, but which was one day to come to pass.
