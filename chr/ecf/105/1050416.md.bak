<span id="xiv.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Remarks on the Tenth Item.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p2"></span>I shall make my next remark with greater
satisfaction. In a former section I expressed a fear <span
id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688.md) that, when Pelagius said that “a
man was able by the help of God’s grace to live without sin,” he perhaps
meant by the term “grace” the capability possessed by nature as created
by God with a free will, as it is understood in that book which I
received as his and to which I replied; <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689.md) and that by these means he was
deceiving the <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="xiv.xxxv-Page_197"></span>judges, who were ignorant of the
circumstances. Now, however, since he anathematizes those persons who
hold that “God’s grace and assistance is not given for single actions,
but is imparted in the freedom of the will, or in the law and in
doctrine,” it is quite evident that he really means the grace which is
preached in the Church of Christ, and is conferred by the ministration
of the Holy Ghost for the purpose of helping us in our single actions,
whence it is that we pray for needful and suitable grace that we enter
not into any temptation. Nor, again, have I any longer a fear that, when
he said, “No man can be without sin unless he has acquired a knowledge
of the law,” and added this explanation of his words, that “he posited
in the knowledge of the law, help towards the avoidance of sin,” <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690.md) he at all meant the said knowledge
to be considered as tantamount to the grace of God; for, observe, he
anathematizes such as hold this opinion. See, too, how he refuses to
hold our natural free will, or the law and doctrine, as equivalent to
that grace of God which helps us through our single actions. What else
then is left to him but to understand that grace which the apostle tells
us is given by “the supply of the Spirit?” <span
id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691.md) and concerning which the Lord said:
“Take no thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you
in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but
the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.” <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md) Nor, again, need I be under any
apprehension that, when he asserted, “All men are ruled by their own
will,” and afterwards explained that he had made that statement “in the
interest of the freedom of our will, of which God is the helper whenever
it makes choice of good,” <span id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md)
that he perhaps here also held God’s helping grace as synonymous with
our natural free will and the teaching of the law. For inasmuch as he
rightly anathematized the persons who hold that God’s grace or
assistance is not given for single actions, but lies in the gift of free
will, or in the law and doctrine, it follows, of course, that God’s
grace or assistance is given us for single actions,—free will, or the
law and the doctrine, being left out of consideration; and thus through
all the single actions of our life, when we act rightly, we are ruled
and directed by God; nor is our prayer a useless one, wherein we say:
“Order my steps according to Thy word, and let not any iniquity have
dominion over me.” <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694.md)
