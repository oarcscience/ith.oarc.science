<span id="xiii.xiv-p2"></span>X. “Since God made man good,” he says,
“and, besides making him good, further commanded him to do good, how
impious it is for us to hold that man is evil, when he was neither made
so, nor so commanded; and to deny him the ability of being good,
although he was both made so, and commanded to act so!” Our answer here
is: Since then it was not man himself, but God, who made man good; so
also is it God, and not man himself, who remakes him to be good, while
liberating him from the evil which he himself did upon his wishing,
believing, and invoking such a deliverance. But all this is effected by
the renewal day by day of the inward man, <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) by the grace of God through our
Lord Jesus Christ, with a view to the outward man’s resurrection at the
last day to an eternity not of punishment, but of life.
