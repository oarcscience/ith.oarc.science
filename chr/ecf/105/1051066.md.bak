<span id="xxi.ii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30 \[XV.\]—The Most Illustrious
Instance of Predestination is Christ Jesus.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxx-p2"></span>Moreover, the most illustrious Light of
predestination and grace is the Saviour Himself,—the Mediator Himself
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. And, pray, by what preceding
merits of its own, whether of works or of faith, did the human nature
which is in Him procure for itself that it should be this? Let this have
an answer, I beg. That man, whence did He deserve this—to be assumed by
the Word co-eternal with the Father into unity of person, and be the
only-begotten Son of God? Was it because any kind of goodness in Him
preceded? What did He do before? What did He believe? What did He ask,
that He should attain to this unspeakable excellence? Was it not by the
act and the assumption of the Word that that man, from the time He began
to be, began to be the only Son of God? Did not that woman, full of
grace, conceive the only Son of God? Was He not born the only Son of
God, of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary,—not of the lust of the
flesh, but by God’s peculiar gift? Was it to be feared that as age
matured this man, He would sin of free will? Or was the will in Him not
free on that account? and was it not so much the more free in proportion
to the greater impossibility of His becoming the servant of sin?
Certainly, in Him human nature—that is to say, our nature—specially
received all those specially admirable gifts, and any others that may
most truly be said to be peculiar to Him, by virtue of no preceding
merits of its own. Let a man here answer to God if he dare, and say, Why
was it not I also? And if he should hear, “O man, who art thou that
repliest against God?” <span id="fr_3509"></span>[3510](#fn_3509.md) let
him not at this point restrain himself, but increase his impudence and
say, “How is it that I hear, Who art thou, O man? since I am what I
hear,—that is, a man, and He of whom I speak is but the same? Why should
not I also be what He is? For it is by grace that He is such and so
great; why is grace different when nature is common? Assuredly, there is
no respect of persons with God.” I say, not what Christian man, but what
madman will say this?
