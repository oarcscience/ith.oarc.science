id="xvi.v.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27 \[XXIV.\]—Through Lust Original
Sin is Transmitted; Venial Sins in Married Persons; Concupiscence of the
Flesh, the Daughter and Mother of Sin.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxvii-p2"></span>Wherefore the devil holds infants
guilty who are born, not of the good by which marriage is good, but of
the evil of concupiscence, which, indeed, marriage uses aright, but at
which even marriage has occasion to feel shame. Marriage is itself
“honourable in all” <span id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md) the goods
which properly appertain to it; but even when it has <span
id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span id="xvi.v.xxvii-Page_275"></span>its
“bed undefiled” (not only by fornication and adultery, which are
damnable disgraces, but also by any of those excesses of cohabitation
such as do not arise from any prevailing desire of children, but from an
overbearing lust of pleasure, which are venial sins in man and wife),
yet, whenever it comes to the actual process of generation, the very
embrace which is lawful and honourable cannot be effected without the
ardour of lust, so as to be able to accomplish that which appertains to
the use of reason and not of lust. Now, this ardour, whether following
or preceding the will, does somehow, by a power of its own, move the
members which cannot be moved simply by the will, and in this manner it
shows itself not to be the servant of a will which commands it, but
rather to be the punishment of a will which disobeys it. It shows,
moreover, that it must be excited, not by a free choice, but by a
certain seductive stimulus, and that on this very account it produces
shame. This is the carnal concupiscence, which, while it is no longer
accounted sin in the regenerate, yet in no case happens to nature except
from sin. It is the daughter of sin, as it were; and whenever it yields
assent to the commission of shameful deeds, it becomes also the mother
of many sins. Now from this concupiscence whatever comes into being by
natural birth is bound by original sin, unless, indeed, it be born again
in Him whom the Virgin conceived without this concupiscence. Wherefore,
when He vouchsafed to be born in the flesh, He alone was born without
sin.
