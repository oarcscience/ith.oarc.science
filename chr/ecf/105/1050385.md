<span id="xiv.iv-p7"></span>*The several heads of error which were
alleged against Pelagius at the Synod in Palestine, with his answers to
each charge, are minutely discussed. Augustin shows that, although
Pelagius was acquitted by the synod, there still clave to him the
suspicion of heresy; and that the acquittal of the accused by the synod
was so contrived, that the heresy itself with which he was charged was
unhesitatingly condemned.*
