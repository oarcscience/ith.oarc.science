id="xv.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XXI.\]—What He Means by Our
Birth to an “Uncertain” Life.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>Certain brethren, however, afterwards
failed not to remind us that Pelagius possibly expressed himself in this
way, because on this question he is represented as having his answer
ready for all inquirers, to this effect: “As for infants who die
unbaptized, I know indeed whither they go not; yet whither they go, I
know not;” that is, I know they do not go into the kingdom of heaven.
But as to whither they go, he was (and for the matter of that, *still
is*  <span id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947) .md) in the habit of saying
that he knew not, because he dared not say that those went to eternal
death, who he was persuaded had never committed sin in this life, and
whom he would not admit to have inherited original sin. Consequently
those very words of his which were forwarded to Rome to secure his
absolute acquittal, are so steeped in ambiguity that they afford a
shelter for their doctrine, out of which may sally forth an heretical
sense to entrap the unwary straggler; for when no one <span
id="page_244">p. 244</span> <span id="xv.iv.xxiii-Page_244"></span>is at
hand who can give the answer, any solitary man may find himself weak.

<span id="xv.iv.xxiii-p3"></span> *Dicebat, aut dicit*. These two latter
words are not superfluous, as some have thought; they intimate that
Pelagius still clave to his error.
