<span id="x.iii.lxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 68 \[XXXVII.\]—If Adam Was Not
Created of Such a Character as that in Which We are Born, How is It that
Christ, Although Free from Sin, Was Born an Infant and in
Weakness?</span>

<span id="x.iii.lxviii-p2"></span>Some one will ask, If this nature is
not pure, but corrupt from its origin, since Adam was not created thus,
how is it that Christ, who is far more excellent, and was certainly born
without any sin of a virgin, nevertheless appeared in this weakness, and
came into the world in infancy? To this question our answer is as
follows: Adam was not created in such a state, because, as no sin from a
parent preceded him, he was not created in sinful flesh. We, however,
are in such a condition, because by reason of his preceding sin we are
born in sinful flesh. While Christ was born in such a state, because, in
order that He might for sin condemn sin, He assumed the likeness of
sinful flesh. <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) The question which
we are now discussing is not about Adam in respect of the size of his
body, why he was not made an infant but in the perfect greatness of his
members. It may indeed be said that the beasts were thus created
likewise,—nor was it owing to their sin that their young were born
small. Why all this came to pass we are not now asking. But the question
before us has regard to the vigor of man’s mind and his use of reason,
by virtue of which Adam was capable of instruction, and could apprehend
God’s precept and the law of His commandment, and could easily keep it
if he would; whereas man is now born in such a state as to be utterly
incapable of doing so, owing to his dreadful ignorance and weakness, not
indeed of body, but of mind,—although we must all admit that in every
infant there exists a rational soul of the self-same substance (and no
other) as that which belonged to the first man. Still this great
infirmity of the flesh, clearly, in my opinion, points to a something,
whatever it may be, that is penal. It raises the doubt whether, if the
first human beings had not sinned, <span id="page_43">p. 43</span> <span
id="x.iii.lxviii-Page_43"></span>they would have had children who could
use neither tongue, nor hands, nor feet. That they should be born
children was perhaps necessary, on account of the limited capacity of
the womb. But, at the same time, it does not follow, because a rib is a
small part of a man’s body, that God made an infant wife for the man,
and then built her up into a woman. In like manner, God’s almighty power
was competent to make her children also, as soon as born, grown up at
once.
