<span id="xvii.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30—The Danger of Arguing from
Silence.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxx-p2"></span>Now, while the disputants are thus
contending with one another in alternate argument, I so judge between
them that they must not rely on uncertain evidence; nor make bold
assertions on points of which they are ignorant. For if the Scripture
had said, “God breathed into the woman’s face the breath of life, and
she became a living soul,” it would not have followed even then that the
human soul is not derived by propagation from parents, except the same
statement were likewise made concerning their son. For it might have
been that whilst an unensouled <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) member taken from the body might
require to be ensouled, <span id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) yet
that the soul of the son might be derived from the father, transfused by
propagation through the mother. There is, however, an absolute silence
on the point; it is entirely concealed from our view. Nothing is denied,
but at the same time nothing is affirmed. And thus, if in any place the
Scripture is possibly not quite silent, the point requires to be
supported by clearer proofs. Whence it follows, that neither they who
maintain the propagation of souls receive any assistance from the
circumstance that God did not breathe into the woman’s face; nor ought
they, who deny this doctrine on the ground that Adam did not say, “This
is soul of my soul,” to persuade themselves to believe what they know
nothing of. For just as it has been possible for the Scripture to be
silent on the point of the woman’s having received her soul, like the
man, by the inbreathing of God, without the question before us being
solved, but, on the contrary, remaining open; so has it been possible
for the same question to remain open and unsolved, notwithstanding the
silence of Scripture, as to whether or not Adam said, This is soul of my
soul. And hence, if the soul of the first woman comes from the man, a
part signifies the whole in his exclamation, “This is now bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh;” inasmuch as not her flesh alone, but the
entire woman, was taken out of man. If, however, it is not from the man,
but came by God’s inbreathing it into her, as at first into the man,
then the whole signifies a part in the passage, “She was taken out of
the man;” since on the supposition it was not her whole self, but her
flesh that was taken.
