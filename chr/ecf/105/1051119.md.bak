<span id="xxi.iii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—Ears to Hear are a
Willingness to Obey.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxxix-p2"></span>Although, therefore, we say that
obedience is the gift of God, we still exhort men to it. But to those
who obediently hear the exhortation of truth is given the gift of God
itself—that is, to hear obediently; while to those who do not thus hear
it is not given. For it was not some one only, but Christ who said, “No
man cometh unto me, except it were given him of my Father;” <span
id="fr_3650"></span>[3651](#fn_3650.md) and, “To you it is given to know
the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
given.” <span id="fr_3651"></span>[3652](#fn_3651.md) And concerning
continence He says, “Not all receive this saying, but they to whom it is
given.” <span id="fr_3652"></span>[3653](#fn_3652.md) And when the apostle
would exhort married people to conjugal chastity, he says, “I would that
all men were even as I myself; but every man hath his proper gift of
God, one after this manner, another after that;” <span
id="fr_3653"></span>[3654](#fn_3653.md) where he plainly shows not only
that continence is a gift of God, but even the chastity of those who are
married. And although these things are true, we still exhort to them as
much as is given to any one of us to be able to exhort, because this
also is His gift in whose hand are both ourselves and our discourses.
Whence also says the apostle, “According to this grace of God which is
given unto me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation.”  <span
id="fr_3654"></span>[3655](#fn_3654.md) And in another place he says, “Even
as the Lord hath given to every man: I have planted, Apollos has
watered, but God has given the increase. Therefore neither is he that
planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the
increase.” <span id="fr_3655"></span>[3656](#fn_3655.md) And thus as only
he preaches and exhorts rightly who has received this gift, so assuredly
he who obediently hears him who rightly exhorts and preaches is he who
has received this gift. Hence is what the Lord said, when, speaking to
those who had their fleshly ears open, He nevertheless told them, “He
that hath ears to hear let him hear;” <span
id="fr_3656"></span>[3657](#fn_3656.md) which beyond a doubt he knew that
not all had. And from whom they have, whosoever they be that have them,
the Lord Himself shows when He says, “I will give them a heart to know
me, and ears to hear.” <span id="fr_3657"></span>[3658](#fn_3657.md)
Therefore, having ears is itself the gift of obeying, so that they who
had that came to Him, to whom “no one comes unless it were given to him
of His Father.” Therefore we exhort and preach, but they who have ears
to hear obediently hear us, while in them who have them not, it comes to
pass what is written, that hearing they do not hear,—hearing, to wit,
with the bodily sense, they do not hear with the assent of the heart.
But why these should have ears to hear, and those have them not,—that
is, why to these it should be given by the Father to come to the Son,
while to those it should not be given,—who has known the mind of the
Lord, or who has been His counsellor? Or who art thou, O man, that
repliest against God? Must that which is manifest be denied, because
that which is hidden cannot be comprehended? Shall we, I say, declare
that what we see to be so is not so, because we cannot find out why it
is so?
