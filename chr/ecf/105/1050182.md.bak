<span id="xi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[IV.\]—The Teaching of Law Without the
Life-Giving Spirit is “The Letter that Killeth.”</span>

<span id="xi.ix-p2"></span>For that teaching which brings to us the
command to live in chastity and righteousness is “the letter that
killeth,” unless accompanied with “the spirit that giveth life.” For
that is not the sole meaning of the passage, “The letter killeth, but
the spirit giveth life,” <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) which
merely prescribes that we should not take in the literal sense any
figurative phrase which in the proper meaning of its words would produce
only nonsense, but should consider what else it signifies, nourishing
the inner man by our spiritual intelligence, since “being
carnally-minded is death, whilst to be spiritually-minded is life and
peace.” <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md) If, for instance, a man
were to take in a literal and carnal sense much that is written in the
Song of Solomon, he would minister not to the fruit of a luminous
charity, but to the feeling of a libidinous desire. Therefore, the
apostle is not to be confined to the limited application just mentioned,
when he says, “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life;” <span
id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) but this is also (and indeed
especially) equivalent to what he says elsewhere in the plainest words:
“I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not
covet;” <span id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) and again, immediately
after: “Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it
slew me.” <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) Now from this you may
see what is meant by “the letter that killeth.” There is, of course,
nothing said figuratively which is not to be accepted in its plain
sense, when it is said, “Thou shall not covet;” but this is a very plain
and salutary precept, and any man who shall fulfil it will have no sin
at all. The apostle, indeed, purposely selected this general precept, in
which he embraced everything, as if this were the voice of the law,
prohibiting us from all sin, when he says, “Thou shalt not covet;” for
there is no sin committed except by evil concupiscence; so that the law
which prohibits this is a good and praiseworthy law. But, when the Holy
Ghost withholds His help, which inspires us with a good desire instead
of this evil desire (in other words, diffuses love in our hearts), that
law, however good in itself, only augments the evil desire by forbidding
it. Just as the rush of water which flows incessantly in a particular
direction, becomes more violent when it meets with any impediment, and
when it has overcome the stoppage, falls in a greater bulk, and with
increased impetuosity hurries forward in its downward course. In some
strange way the very object which we covet becomes all the more pleasant
when it is forbidden. And this is the sin which by the commandment
deceives and by it slays, whenever transgression is actually added,
which occurs not where there is no law. <span
