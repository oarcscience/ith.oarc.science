<span id="xxi.ii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Christ Predestinated to Be the
Son of God.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxi-p2"></span>Therefore in Him who is our Head let
there appear to be the very fountain of grace, whence, according to the
measure of every man, He diffuses Himself through all His members. It is
by that grace that every man from the beginning of his faith becomes a
Christian, by which grace that one man from His beginning became <span
id="page_513">p. 513</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.xxxi-Page_513"></span>Christ. Of the same Spirit also the
former is born again of which the latter was born. By the same Spirit is
effected in us the remission of sins, by which Spirit it was effected
that He should have no sin. God certainly foreknew that He would do
these things. This, therefore, is that same predestination of the saints
which most especially shone forth in the Saint of saints; and who is
there of those who rightly understand the declarations of the truth that
can deny this predestination? For we have learned that the Lord of glory
Himself was predestinated in so far as the man was made the Son of God.
The teacher of the Gentiles exclaims, in the beginning of his epistles,
“Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated
unto the gospel of God (which He had promised afore by His prophets in
the Holy Scriptures) concerning His Son, which was made of the seed of
David according to the flesh, who was predestinated the Son of God in
power, according to the Spirit of sanctification by the resurrection of
the dead.” <span id="fr_3510"></span>[3511](#fn_3510.md) Therefore Jesus
was predestinated, so that He who was to be the Son of David according
to the flesh should yet be in power the Son of God, according to the
Spirit of sanctification, because He was born of the Holy Spirit and of
the Virgin Mary. This is that ineffably accomplished sole taking up of
man by God the Word, so that He might truly and properly be called at
the same time the Son of God and the Son of man,—Son of man on account
of the man taken up, and the Son of God on account of the God
only-begotten who took Him up, so that a Trinity and not a Quaternity
might be believed in. Such a transporting of human nature was
predestinated, so great, so lofty, and so sublime that there was no
exalting it more highly,—just as on our behalf that divinity had no
possibility of more humbly putting itself off, than by the assumption of
man’s nature with the weakness of the flesh, even to the death of the
cross. As, therefore, that one man was predestinated to be our Head, so
we being many are predestinated to be His members. Here let human merits
which have perished through Adam keep silence, and let that grace of God
reign which reigns through Jesus Christ our Lord, the only Son of God,
the one Lord. Let whoever can find in our Head the merits which preceded
that peculiar generation, seek in us His members for those merits which
preceded our manifold regeneration. For that generation was not
recompensed to Christ, but given; that He should be born, namely, of the
Spirit and the Virgin, separate from all entanglement of sin. Thus also
our being born again of water and the Spirit is not recompensed to us
for any merit, but freely given; and if faith has brought us to the
laver of regeneration, we ought not therefore to suppose that we have
first given anything, so that the regeneration of salvation should be
recompensed to us again; because He made us to believe in Christ, who
made for us a Christ on whom we believe. He makes in men the beginning
and the completion of the faith in Jesus who made the man Jesus the
beginner and finisher of faith; <span
id="fr_3511"></span>[3512](#fn_3511.md) for thus, as you know, He is called
in the epistle which is addressed to the Hebrews.
