<span id="xix.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Other Passages of Scripture Which
the Pelagians Abuse.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xi-p2"></span>Then, again, there is the Scripture
contained in the second book of the Chronicles: “The Lord is with you
when ye are with Him: and if ye shall seek Him ye shall find Him; but if
ye forsake Him, He also will forsake you.” <span
id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016) This passage, no doubt, clearly
manifests the choice of the will. But they who maintain that God’s grace
is given according to our merits, receive these testimonies of Scripture
in such a manner as to believe that our merit lies in the circumstance
of our “being with God,” while His grace is given according to this
merit, so that He too may be with us. In like manner, that our merit
lies in the fact of “our seeking God,” and then His grace is given
according to this merit, in order that we may find Him.” Again, there is
a passage in the first book of the same Chronicles which declares the
choice of the will: “And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy
father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind, for
the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of
the thoughts; if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee; but if thou
forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever.” <span
id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017) But these people find some room for
human merit in the clause, “If thou seek Him,” and then the grace is
thought to be given according to this merit in what is said in the
ensuing words, “He will be found of thee.” And so they labour with all
their might to show that God’s grace is given according to our
merits,—in other words, that grace is not grace. For, as the apostle
most expressly says, to them who receive reward according to merit “the
recompense is not reckoned of grace but of debt.” <span
