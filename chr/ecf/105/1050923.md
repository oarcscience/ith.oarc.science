<span id="xviii.vi.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—The Testimonies of Ambrose
Concerning God’s Grace.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxx-p2"></span>The Pelagians say that merit begins
from man by free will, to which God repays the subsequent aid of grace.
Let the venerable Ambrose here also refute them, when he says, in his
exposition of the prophet Isaiah, “that human care without divine help
is powerless for healing, and needs a divine helper.” Also, in the
treatise which is inscribed, “On the Avoidance of the World,” <span
id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891) he says: “Our discourse is frequent
on the avoidance of this world; and I wish that our disposition were as
cautious and careful as our discourse is easy. But what is worse, the
enticement of earthly lusts frequently creeps in, and the flowing forth
of vanities takes hold of the mind, so that the very thing that you
desire to avoid you think upon, and turn over in your mind; and this it
is difficult for a man to beware of, but to get rid of it is impossible.
Finally, that that is rather a matter to be wished than to be
accomplished the prophet testifies when he says, ‘Incline my heart unto
thy testimonies, and not to avarice.’ <span
id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892) For our heart and our thoughts are
not in our power, seeing that they are suddenly forced forth and confuse
the mind and the soul and draw them in other directions from those which
you have proposed for them;—they recall to things of time, they suggest
worldly things, they obtrude voluptuous thoughts, they inweave seducing
thoughts, and, in the very season in which we are proposing to lift up
our mind, vain thoughts are intruded upon us, and we are cast down for
the most part to things of earth; and who is so happy as always to rise
upwards in his heart? And how can this be done without the divine help?
Absolutely in no manner. Finally, of old Scripture says the same thing,
‘Blessed is the man whose help is of Thee, O Lord; in his heart is going
up.’” <span id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893) What can be said more
openly and more sufficiently? But lest the Pelagians perchance should
answer that, in that very point in which divine help is <span
id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span
id="xviii.vi.xxx-Page_432"></span>asked for, man’s merit precedes,
saying that that very thing is merit, that by his prayer he is desiring
that divine grace should come to his assistance, let them give heed to
what the same holy man says in his exposition of Isaiah. He says: “And
to pray God is a spiritual grace; for no man says that Jesus is the
Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894) Whence also, expounding the Gospel
according to Luke, <span id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895) he says:
“You see certainly that everywhere the power of the Lord cooperates with
human desires, so that no man can build without the Lord, no man can
undertake anything without the Lord.” Because such a man as Ambrose says
this, and commends God’s grace, as it is fitting for a son of promise to
do, with grateful piety, does he therefore destroy free will? Or does he
mean grace to be understood as the Pelagians in their different
discourses will have to appear nothing but law—so that, for instance,
God may be believed to help us not to do what we may know, but to know
what we may do? If they think that such a man of God as this is of this
mind, let them hear what he has said about the law itself. In the book
“On the Avoidance of the World,” he says: “The law could stop the mouth
of all men; it could not convert their mind.” <span
id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896) In another place also, in the same
treatise, he says: “The law condemns the deed; it does not take away its
wickedness.” <span id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897) Let them see
that this faithful and catholic man agrees with the apostle who says,
“Now we know that what things soever the law says, it says to those who
are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world
may become guilty before God. Because by the law no flesh shall be
justified in His sight.” <span id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898) For
from that apostolic opinion Ambrose took and wrote these things.
