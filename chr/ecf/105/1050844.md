<span id="xviii.iv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—The Heresies of the
Manicheans and Pelagians are Mutually Opposed, and are Alike Reprobated
by the Catholic Church.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.ii-p2"></span>The Manicheans say that the good God is
not the Creator of all natures; the Pelagians that God is not the
Purifier, the Saviour, the Deliverer of all ages among men. The catholic
Church condemns both; as well maintaining God’s creation against the
Manicheans, that no nature may be denied to be framed by Him, as
maintaining against the Pelagians that in all ages human nature must be
sought after as ruined. The Manicheans rebuke the concupiscence of the
flesh, not as if it were an accidental vice, but as if it were a nature
bad from eternity; the Pelagians approve it as if it were no vice, but
even a natural good. The catholic faith condemns both, saying to the
Manicheans, “It is not nature, but it is vice;” saying to the Pelagians,
“It is not of the Father, but it is of the world;” in order that both
may allow it as an evil sickness to be cured—the former by ceasing to
believe it, as it were, incurable, the latter by ceasing to proclaim it
as laudable. The Manicheans deny that to a good man the beginning of
evil came from free will; the Pelagians say that even a bad man has free
will sufficiently to perform the good commandment. The catholic Church
condemns both, saying to the former, “God made man upright,” <span
id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) and saying to the latter, “If the
Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” <span
id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) The Manicheans say that the soul,
as a particle of God, has sin by the commixture of an evil nature; the
Pelagians say that the soul is upright, not indeed a particle, but a
creature of God, and has not even in this corruptible life any sin. The
catholic Church condemns both, saying to the Manicheans, “Either make
the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree evil and its fruit
evil,” <span id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624.md) which would not be
said to man who cannot make his own nature, unless because sin is not
nature, but vice; and saying to the Pelagians, “If we say that we have
no sin we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” <span
id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625.md) In these diseases, opposed as they
are to one another, the Manicheans and the Pelagians are at issue, with
dissimilar will but with similar vanity, separated by different
opinions, but close together by a perverse mind.
