<span id="x.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38 \[XXIV.\]—What Benefit Has Been
Conferred on Us by the Incarnation of the Word; Christ’s Birth in the
Flesh, Wherein It is Like and Wherein Unlike Our Own Birth.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span>He goes on to add, “And the Word was
made <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span
id="x.iv.xxxviii-Page_60"></span>flesh, and dwelt among us;” <span
id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597) as much as to say, A great thing
indeed has been done among them, even that they are born again to God of
God, who had before been born of the flesh to the world, although
created by God Himself; but a far more wonderful thing has been done
that, although it accrued to them by nature to be born of the flesh, but
by the divine goodness to be born of God,—in order that so great a
benefit might be imparted to them, He who was in His own nature born of
God, vouchsafed in mercy to be also born of the flesh;—no less being
meant by the passage, “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”
Hereby, he says in effect, it has been wrought that we who were born of
the flesh as flesh, by being afterwards born of the Spirit, may be
spirit and dwell in God; because also God, who was born of God, by being
afterwards born of the flesh, became flesh, and dwelt among us. For the
Word, which became flesh, was in the beginning, and was God with
God. <span id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598) But at the same time His
participation in our inferior condition, in order to our participation
in His higher state, held a kind of medium <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599) in His birth of the flesh; so that we
indeed were born in sinful flesh, but He was born in the likeness of
sinful flesh,—we not only of flesh and blood, but also of the will of
man, and of the flesh, but He was born only of flesh and blood, not of
the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God: we,
therefore, to die on account of sin, He, to die on our account without
sin. So also, just as His inferior circumstances, into which He
descended to us, were not in every particular exactly the same with our
inferior circumstances, in which He found us here; so our superior
state, into which we ascend to Him, will not be quite the same with His
superior state, in which we are there to find Him. For we by His grace
are to be made the sons of God, whereas He was evermore by nature the
Son of God; we, when we are converted, shall cleave to God, though not
as His equals; He never turned from God, and remains ever equal to God;
we are partakers of eternal life, He is eternal life. He, therefore,
alone having become man, but still continuing to be God, never had any
sin, nor did he assume a flesh of sin, though born of a maternal <span
id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600) flesh of sin. For what He then took of
flesh, He either cleansed in order to take it, or cleansed by taking it.
His virgin mother, therefore, whose conception was not according to the
law of sinful flesh (in other words, not by the excitement of carnal
concupiscence), but who merited by her faith that the holy seed should
be framed within her, He formed in order to choose her, and chose in
order to be formed from her. How much more needful, then, is it for
sinful flesh to be baptized in order to escape the judgment, when the
flesh which was untainted by sin was baptized to set an example for
imitation?
