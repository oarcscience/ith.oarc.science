id="xx.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Therefore Rebuke is to Be
Used.</span>

<span id="xx.xxviii-p2"></span>Let no one therefore say that a man must
not be rebuked when he deviates from the right way, but that his return
and perseverance must only be asked for from the Lord for him. Let no
considerate and believing man say this. For if such an one is called
according to the purpose, beyond all doubt God is co-working for good to
him even in the fact of his being rebuked. But since he who rebukes is
ignorant whether he is so called, let him do with love what he knows
ought to be done; for he knows that such an one ought to be rebuked. God
will show either mercy or judgment; mercy, indeed, if he who is rebuked
is “made to differ” by the bestowal of grace from the mass of perdition,
and is not found among the vessels of wrath which are completed for
destruction, but among the vessels of mercy which God has prepared for
glory; <span id="fr_3338"></span>[3339](#fn_3338.md) but judgment, if among
the former he is condemned, and is not predestinated among the latter.
