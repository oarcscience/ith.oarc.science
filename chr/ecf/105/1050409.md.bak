<span id="xiv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Pelagius’ Answer to the Charges
Brought Together Under the Seventh Item.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p2"></span>The following, as the proceedings
testify, was Pelagius’ own answer to these charges against him:
“Concerning a man’s being able indeed to be without sin, we have
spoken,” says he, “already; concerning the fact, however, that before
the Lord’s coming there were persons without sin, we say now that,
previous to Christ’s advent, some men lived holy and righteous lives,
according to the teaching of the sacred Scriptures. The rest were not
said by me, as even their testimony goes to show, and for them, I <span
id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span id="xiv.xxviii-Page_194"></span>do not
feel that I am responsible. But for the satisfaction of the holy synod,
I anathematize those who either now hold, or have ever held, these
opinions.” After hearing this answer of his, the synod said: “With
regard to these charges aforesaid, Pelagius has in our presence given us
sufficient and proper satisfaction, by anathematizing the opinions which
were not his.” We see, therefore, and maintain that the most pernicious
evils of this heresy have been condemned, not only by Pelagius, but also
by the holy bishops who presided over that inquiry:—that “Adam was made
mortal;” (and, that the meaning of this statement might be more clearly
understood, it was added, “and he would have died whether he had sinned
or not sinned;”) that his sin injured only himself and not the human
race; that the law, no less than the gospel, leads us to the kingdom of
heaven; that new born infants are in the same condition that Adam was
before the fall; that the entire human race does not, on the one hand,
die through Adam’s death and transgression, nor, on the other hand, does
the whole human race rise again through the resurrection of Christ; that
infants, even if they die unbaptized, have eternal life; that rich men
even if baptized, unless they renounce and give up all, have, whatever
good they may seem to have done, nothing of it reckoned to them, neither
can they possess the kingdom of God;”—all these opinions, at any rate,
were clearly condemned in that ecclesiastical court,—Pelagius
pronouncing the anathema, and the bishops the interlocutory sentence.
