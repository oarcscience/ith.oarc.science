<span id="xvi.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[XV.\]—What is Sinless in the
Use of Matrimony? What is Attended With Venial Sin, and What with
Mortal?</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xvii-p2"></span>It is, however, one thing for married
persons to have intercourse only for the wish to beget children, which
is not sinful: it is another thing for them to desire carnal pleasure in
cohabitation, but with the spouse only, which involves venial sin. For
although propagation of offspring is not the motive of the intercourse,
there <span id="page_271">p. 271</span> <span
id="xvi.v.xvii-Page_271"></span>is still no attempt to prevent such
propagation, either by wrong desire or evil appliance. They who resort
to these, although called by the name of spouses, are really not such;
they retain no vestige of true matrimony, but pretend the honourable
designation as a cloak for criminal conduct. Having also proceeded so
far, they are betrayed into exposing their children, which are born
against their will. They hate to nourish and retain those whom they were
afraid they would beget. This infliction of cruelty on their offspring
so reluctantly begotten, unmasks the sin which they had practised in
darkness, and drags it clearly into the light of day. The open cruelty
reproves the concealed sin. Sometimes, indeed, this lustful cruelty, or,
if you please, cruel lust, resorts to such extravagant methods as to use
poisonous drugs to secure barrenness; or else, if unsuccessful in this,
to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth,
preferring that its offspring should rather perish than receive
vitality; or if it was advancing to life within the womb, should be
slain before it was born. Well, if both parties alike are so flagitious,
they are not husband and wife; and if such were their character from the
beginning, they have not come together by wedlock but by debauchery. But
if the two are not alike in such sin, I boldly declare either that the
woman is, so to say, the husband’s harlot; or the man the wife’s
adulterer.
