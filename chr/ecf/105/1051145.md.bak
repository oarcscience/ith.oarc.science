<span id="xxi.iii.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 63 \[XXIII.\]—The Testimony of the
Whole Church in Her Prayers.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lxv-p2"></span>And I wish that those who are slow and
weak of heart, who cannot, or cannot as yet, understand the Scriptures
or the explanations of them, would so hear or not hear our arguments in
this question as to consider more carefully their prayers, which the
Church has always used and will use, even from its beginnings until this
age shall be completed. For of this matter, which I am now compelled not
only to mention, but even to protect and defend against these new
heretics, the Church has never been silent in its prayers, although in
its discourses it has not thought that it need be put forth, as there
was no adversary compelling it. For when was not prayer made in the
Church for unbelievers and its opponents that they should believe? When
has any believer had a friend, a neighbour, a wife, who did not believe,
and has not asked on their behalf from the Lord for a mind obedient to
the Christian faith? And who has there ever been who has not prayed for
himself that he might abide in the Lord? And who has dared, not only
with his <span id="page_551">p. 551</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.lxv-Page_551"></span>voice, but even in thought, to blame
the priest who invokes the Lord on behalf of believers, if at any time
he has said, “Give to them, O Lord, perseverance in Thee to the end!”
and has not rather responded, over such a benediction of his, as well
with confessing lips as believing heart, “Amen”? Since in the Lord’s
Prayer itself the believers do not pray for anything else, especially
when they say that petition, “Lead us not into temptation,” save that
they may persevere in holy obedience. As, therefore, the Church has both
been born and grows and has grown in these prayers, so it has been born
and grows and has grown in this faith, by which faith it is believed
that God’s grace is not given according to the merits of the receivers.
For, certainly, the Church would not pray that faith should be given to
unbelievers, unless it believed that God converts to Himself both the
averse and adverse wills of men. Nor would the Church pray that it might
persevere in the faith of Christ, not deceived nor overcome by the
temptations of the world, unless it believed that the Lord has our heart
in His power, in such wise as that the good which we do not hold save by
our own will, we nevertheless do not hold except He worketh in us to
will also. For if the Church indeed asks these things from Him, but
thinks that the same things are given to itself by itself, it makes use
of prayers which are not true, but perfunctory,—which be far from us!
For who truly groans, desiring to receive what he prays for from the
Lord, if he thinks that he receives it from himself, and not from the
Lord?
