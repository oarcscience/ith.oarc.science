<span id="xviii.vi.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—The Pelagians Understand that
the Law Itself is God’s Grace.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xi-p2"></span>But those enemies of grace never
endeavour to lay more secret snares for more vehement opposition to that
same grace than when they praise the law, which, without doubt, is
worthy to be praised. <span id="fr_2800"></span>[2801](#fn_2800)
Because, by their different modes of speaking, and by variety of words
in all their arguments, they wish the law to be understood as
“grace”—that, to wit, we may have from the Lord God the help of
knowledge, whereby we may know those things which have to be done,—not
the inspiration of love, that, when known, we may do them with a holy
love, which is properly grace. For the knowledge of the law without love
puffeth up, does not edify, according to the same apostle, who most
openly says, “Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.” <span
id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801) Which saying is like to that in
which it is said, “The letter killeth, the spirit maketh alive.” <span
id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802) For “Knowledge puffeth up,”
corresponds to “The letter killeth:” and, “Love edifieth,” to “The
spirit maketh alive;” because “the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given unto us.” <span
id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803) Therefore the knowledge of the law
makes a proud transgressor; but, by the gift of charity, he delights to
be a doer of the law. We do not then make void the law through faith,
but we establish the law, <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804)
which by terrifying leads to faith. Thus certainly the law worketh
wrath, that the mercy of God may bestow grace on the sinner, frightened
and turned to the fulfilment of the righteousness of the law through
Jesus Christ our Lord, who is that wisdom of God of which it is written,
“She carries law and mercy on her tongue,” <span
id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805) —law whereby she frightens, mercy
by which she may help,—law by His servant, mercy by Himself,—the law, as
it were, in the staff which Elisha <span
id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806) sent to raise up the son of the
widow, and it failed to raise him up, “For if a law had been given which
could have given life, righteousness would altogether have been by the
law,” <span id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807) but mercy, as it were,
in Elisha himself, who, wearing the figure of Christ, by giving life to
the dead was joined in the signification of the great sacrament, as it
were, of the New Testament.
