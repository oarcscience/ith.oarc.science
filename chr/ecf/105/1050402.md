Answers.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxi-p2"></span>Well, now, had the judges either the power
or the right to condemn these unrecognised and vague words, when no
person on the other side was present to assert that Pelagius had written
the very culpable sentences which were alleged to have been addressed by
him to the widow? In such a matter, it surely could not be enough to
produce a manuscript, and to read out of it words as his, if there were
not also witnesses forthcoming in case he denied, on the words being
read out, that they ever dropped from his pen. But even here the judges
did all that lay in their power to do, when they asked Pelagius whether
he would anathematize the persons who held such sentiments as he
declared he had never himself propounded either in speech or in writing.
And when he answered that he did anathematize them as fools, what right
had the judges to push the inquiry any further on the matter, in the
absence of Pelagius’ opponents?
