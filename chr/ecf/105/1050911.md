id="xviii.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—The Opinion of the Saints
Themselves About Themselves.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xviii-p2"></span>It is to be confessed that “the Holy
Spirit, even in the old times,” not only “aided good dispositions,”
which even they allow, but that it even made them good, which they will
not have. “That all, also, of the prophets and apostles or saints, both
evangelical and ancient, to whom God gives His witness, were righteous,
not in comparison with the wicked, but by the rule of virtue,” is not
doubtful. And this is opposed to the Manicheans, who blaspheme the
patriarchs and prophets; but what is opposed to the Pelagians is, that
all of these, when interrogated concerning themselves while they lived
in the body, with one most accordant voice would answer, “If we should
say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.” <span id="fr_2838"></span>[2839](#fn_2838.md) “But in the future
time,” it is not to be denied “that there will be a reward as well of
good works as of evil, and that no one will be commanded to do the
commandments there which here he has contemned,” but that a sufficiency
of perfect righteousness where sin cannot be, a righteousness which is
here hungered and thirsted after by the saints, is here hoped for in
precept, is there received as a reward, on the entreaty of alms and
<span id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span
id="xviii.vi.xviii-Page_425"></span>prayers; so that what here may have
been wanting in fulfilment of the commandments may become unpunished for
the forgiveness of sin. <span id="fr_2839"></span>[2840](#fn_2839.md)
