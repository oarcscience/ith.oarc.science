<span id="xiv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[III.\]—The Second Item in the
Accusation; And Pelagius’ Answer.</span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p2"></span>The synod of bishops then proceeded to say:
“Let another section be read.” Accordingly there was read the passage in
the same book wherein Pelagius had laid down the position that “all men
are ruled by their own will.” On this being read, Pelagius said in
answer: “This I stated in the interest of free will. God is its helper
whenever it chooses good; man, however, when sinning is himself in
fault, as under the direction of a free will.” Upon hearing this, the
bishops exclaimed: “Nor again is this opposed to the doctrine of the
Church.” For who indeed could condemn or deny the freedom of the will,
when God’s help is associated with it? His opinion, therefore, as thus
explained in his answer, was, with good reason, deemed satisfactory by
the bishops. And yet, after all, the statement made in his book, “All
men are ruled by their own will,” ought without doubt to have deeply
disturbed the brethren, who had discovered what these men are accustomed
to dispute against the grace of God. For it is said, “All men are ruled
by their own will,” as if God rules no man, and the Scripture says in
vain, “Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; rule them, and lift
them up for ever.” <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) They would
not, of course, stay, if they are ruled only by their own will without
God, even as sheep which have no shepherd: which, God forbid for us.
For, unquestionably to be led is something more compulsory than to be
ruled. He who is ruled at the same time does something himself,—indeed,
when ruled by God, it is with the express view that he should also act
rightly; whereas the man who is led can hardly be understood to do any
thing himself at all. And yet the Saviour’s helpful grace is so much
better than our own wills and desires, that the apostle does not
hesitate to say: “As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
sons of God.” <span id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) And our free
will can do nothing better for us than to submit itself to be led by Him
who can do nothing amiss; and after doing this, not to doubt that it was
helped to do it by Him of whom it is said in the psalm, “He is my God,
His mercy shall go before me.” <span
