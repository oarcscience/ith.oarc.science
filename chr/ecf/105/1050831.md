<span id="xviii.iii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32 \[XVI.\]—The Aprons Which
Adam and Eve Wore.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxxii-p2"></span>For they did not use for themselves
tunics to cover their whole bodies after their sin, but aprons, <span
id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595.md) which some of the less careful of
our translators have translated as “coverings.” And this indeed is true;
but “covering” is a general name, by which may be understood every kind
of clothing and veil. And ambiguity ought to be avoided, so that, as the
Greek called them <span class="Greek"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxxii-p3.2"></span>περιζώματα</span>, by which only the
shameful parts of the body are covered, so also the Latin should either
use the Greek word itself, because now <span id="page_387">p. 387</span>
<span id="xviii.iii.xxxii-Page_387"></span>custom has come to use it
instead of the Latin, or, as some do, use the word aprons, <span
id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) or, as others have better named
them, wrestling aprons. <span id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md)
Because this name is taken from that ancient Roman custom whereby the
youth covered their shameful parts when they were exercised naked in the
field; whence even at this day they are called *campestrati*, <span
id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md) since they cover those members with
the girdle. Although, if those members by which sin was committed were
to be covered after the sin, men ought not indeed to have been clothed
in tunics, but to have covered their hand and mouth, because they sinned
by taking and eating. What, then, is the meaning, when the prohibited
food was taken, and the transgression of the precept had been committed,
of the look turned towards those members? What unknown novelty is felt
there, and compels itself to be noticed? And this is signified by the
opening of the eyes. For their eyes were not closed, either when Adam
gave names to the cattle and birds, or when Eve saw the trees to be
beautiful and good; but they were made open—that is, attentive—to
consider; as it is written of Agar, the handmaid of Sarah, that she
opened her eyes and saw a well, <span
id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md) although she certainly had not had
them closed before. As, therefore, they were so suddenly ashamed of
their nakedness, which they were daily in the habit of looking upon and
were not confused, that they could now no longer bear those members
naked, but immediately took care to cover them; did not they—he in the
open, she in the hidden impulse—perceive those members to be disobedient
to the choice of their will, which certainly they ought to have ruled
like the rest by their voluntary command? And this they deservedly
suffered, because they themselves also were not obedient to their Lord.
Therefore they blushed that they in such wise had not manifested service
to their Creator, that they should deserve to lose dominion over those
members by which children were to be procreated.
