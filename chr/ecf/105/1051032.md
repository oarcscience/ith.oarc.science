id="xx.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—The Purpose of Rebuke.</span>

<span id="xx.li-p2"></span>Although, therefore, even while the faith of
some is subverted, the foundation of God standeth sure, since the Lord
knoweth them that are His, still, we ought not on that account to be
indolent and negligent in rebuking those who should be rebuked. For not
for nothing was it said, “Evil communications corrupt good
manners;” <span id="fr_3405"></span>[3406](#fn_3405.md) and, “The weak
brother shall perish in thy knowledge, on account of whom Christ
died.” <span id="fr_3406"></span>[3407](#fn_3406.md) Let us not, in
opposition to these precepts, and to a wholesome fear, pretend to argue,
saying, “Well, let evil communications corrupt good manners, and let the
weak brother perish. What is that to us? The foundation of God standeth
sure, and no one perishes but the son of perdition.” \[XVI.\] Be it far
from us to babble in this wise, and think that we ought to be secure in
this negligence. For it is true that no one perishes except the son of
perdition, but God says by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel: <span
id="fr_3407"></span>[3408](#fn_3407.md) “He shall surely die in his sin,
but his blood will I require at the hand of the watchman.”
