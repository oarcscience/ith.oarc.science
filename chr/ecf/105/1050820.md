<span id="xviii.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—No Condemnation in Christ
Jesus.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxi-p2"></span>Then he adds the reason why he said
all these things: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from
the body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our
Lord!” And thence he concludes: “Therefore I myself with the mind serve
the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.” <span
id="fr_2579"></span>[2580](#fn_2579.md) To wit, with the flesh, the law of
sin, by lusting; but with the mind, the law of God, by not consenting to
that lust. “For there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ
Jesus.” <span id="fr_2580"></span>[2581](#fn_2580.md) For he is not
condemned who does not consent to the evil of the lust of the flesh.
“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made thee free
from the law of sin and death,” so that, to wit, the lust of the flesh
may not appropriate to itself thy consent. And what follows more and
more demonstrates the same meaning. But moderation must be used.
