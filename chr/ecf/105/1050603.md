<span id="xvi.v.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38 \[XXXIII.\]—To Baptism Must Be
Referred All Remission of Sins, and the Complete Healing of the
Resurrection. Daily Cleansing.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxviii-p2"></span>Blessed, therefore, is the olive tree
“whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;” blessed is
it “to which the Lord hath not imputed sin.” <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md) But this, which has received the
remission, the covering, and the acquittal, even up to the complete
change into an eternal immortality, still retains a secret force which
furnishes seed for a wild and bitter olive tree, unless the same tillage
of God prunes it also, by remission, covering, and acquittal. There
will, however, be left no corruption at all in even carnal seed, when
the same regeneration, which <span id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span
id="xvi.v.xxxviii-Page_279"></span>is now effected through the sacred
laver, purges and heals all man’s evil to the very end. By its means the
very same flesh, through which the carnal mind was formed, shall become
spiritual,—no longer having that carnal lust which resists the law of
the mind, no longer emitting carnal seed. For in this sense must be
understood that which the apostle whom we have so often quoted says
elsewhere: “Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it; that He
might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of water by the word; that
He might present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or
wrinkle, or any such thing.” <span id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md)
It must, I say, be understood as implying, that by this laver of
regeneration and word of sanctification all the evils of regenerate men
of whatever kind are cleansed and healed,—not the sins only which are
all now remitted in baptism, but those also which after baptism are
committed by human ignorance and frailty; not, indeed, that baptism is
to be repeated as often as sin is repeated, but that by its one only
ministration it comes to pass that pardon is secured to the faithful of
all their sins both before and after their regeneration. For of what use
would repentance be, either before baptism, if baptism did not follow;
or after it, if it did not precede? Nay, in the Lord’s Prayer itself,
which is our daily cleansing, of what avail or advantage would it be for
that petition to be uttered, “Forgive us our debts,” <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md) unless it be by such as have been
baptized? And in like manner, how great soever be the liberality and
kindness of a man’s alms, what, I ask, would they profit him towards the
remission of his sins if he had not been baptized? In short, on whom but
on the baptized shall be bestowed the very felicities of the kingdom of
heaven; where the Church shall have no spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing; where there shall be nothing blameworthy, nothing unreal; where
there shall be not only no guilt for sin, but no concupiscence to excite
it?
