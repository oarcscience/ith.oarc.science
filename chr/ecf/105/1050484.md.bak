id="xv.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XXVIII.\]—When He Speaks of
God’s Help, He Means It Only to Help Us Do What Without It We Still
Could Do.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxix-p2"></span>Again, in the first book of his
*Defence of the Freedom of the Will*, he says: “But while we have within
us a free will so strong and so stedfast against sinning, which our
Maker has implanted in human nature generally, still, by His unspeakable
goodness, we are further defended by His own daily help.” What need is
there of such help, if free will is so strong and so stedfast against
sinning? But here, as before, he would have it understood that the
purpose of the alleged assistance is, that that may be more easily
accomplished by grace which he nevertheless supposes may be effected,
less easily, no doubt, but yet actually, without grace.
