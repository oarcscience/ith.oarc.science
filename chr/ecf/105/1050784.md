<span id="xvii.vii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Is the Soul Deformed by the
Body’s Imperfections?</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxviii-p2"></span>Now, again, what means it that you
say, “The soul acquires form from the body, and grows and extends with
the increase of the body,” without keeping in view what a monstrosity
the soul of either a young man or an old man would become if his arm had
been amputated when he was an infant? “The hand of the soul,” you say,
“contracts itself, so that it is not amputated with the hand of the
body, and by condensation it shrinks into other parts of the body.” At
this rate the aforesaid arm of the soul will be kept, wherever it holds
its ground, as short as it was at first when it received the form of the
body, because it has lost the form by the growth of which it might
itself have increased at an equal degree of expansion. Thus the soul of
the young man or the old man who lost his hand in his infancy advances
with two hands, indeed (because the one which shrank back escaped the
amputation of the bodily limb), but one of these was the hand of an
adult, young or old, according to the hypothesis, while the other was
only an infant’s hand, just as it was when the amputation happened. Such
souls, believe me, are not made in the mould and form of the body, but
they are fictitiously framed under the deformed stamp of error. It seems
to me impossible for you to be rescued from this error, unless with
God’s help you fully and calmly examine the visions of those who dream,
and from these convince yourself that some forms are not real bodies,
but only the semblances of bodies. Now, although even those objects
which we suppose to be like bodies are of the same class, <span
id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495.md) yet so far as the dead are
concerned, we can form an after guess about them from persons who are
asleep. For it is not in vain that Holy Scripture describes as “asleep”
those who are dead <span id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) were it
only because in a certain sense “sleep is akin to death.” <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md)

really “dead,” afterwards mentioned), such as are seen by living persons
in visions.
