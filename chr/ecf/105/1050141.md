<span id="x.iv.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52 \[XXXII.\]—Why Christ, After His
Resurrection, Withdrew His Presence from the World.</span>

<span id="x.iv.lii-p2"></span>Although, therefore, the Lord wrought many
visible miracles in order that faith might sprout at first and be fed by
infant nourishment, and grow to its full strength by and by out of this
softness (for as faith becomes stronger the less does it seek such
help); He nevertheless wished us to wait quietly, without visible
inducements, for the promised hope, in order that “the just might live
by faith;” <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md) and so great was this
wish of His, that though He rose from the dead the third day, He did not
desire to remain among men, but, after leaving a proof of his
resurrection by showing Himself in the flesh to those whom He deigned to
have for His witnesses of this event, He ascended into heaven,
withdrawing Himself thus from their sight, and conferring no such thing
on the flesh of any one of them as He had displayed in His own flesh, in
order that they too “might live by faith,” and in the present world
might wait in patience and without visible inducements for the reward of
that righteousness in which men live by faith,—a reward which should
hereafter be visibly and openly bestowed. To this signification I
believe that passage must be referred which He speaks concerning the
Holy Ghost: “He will not come, unless I depart.” <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md) For this was in fact saying Ye shall
not be able to live righteously by faith, which ye shall have as a gift
of mine,—that is, from the Holy Ghost,—unless I withdraw from your eyes
that which ye now gaze upon, in order that your heart may advance in
spiritual growth by fixing its faith on invisible things. This
righteousness of faith He constantly commends to them. Speaking of the
Holy Ghost, He says, “He shall reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they have not believed
on me: of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye shall see me
no more.” <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md) What is that
righteousness, whereby men were not to see Him, except that “the just is
to live by faith,” and that we, not looking at the things which are
seen, but at those which are not seen, are to wait in the Spirit for the
hope of the righteousness that is by faith?
