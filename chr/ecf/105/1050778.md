id="xvii.vii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Names Do Not Imply
Corporeity.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxii-p2"></span>You also say, that “names cease to be
given, when form is not distinguished; and that, where there is no
designation of persons, there is no giving of names.” Your aim is to
prove that Abraham’s soul was corporeal, inasmuch as he could be
addressed as “Father Abraham.” Now, we have already said, that there is
form even where there is no body. If, however, you think that where
there are not bodies there is no assigning of names, I must beg of you
to count the names which occur in this passage of Scripture, “But the
fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance,” <span
id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487) and tell me whether you do not
recognise the very things of which these are the names; or whether you
recognise them so as to descry some outlines of bodies. Come, tell me,
to mention only love, for instance, what are its members, its figure,
its colour? For if you are not yourself empty-headed, these
appurtenances cannot possibly be regarded by you as an empty thing. Then
you go on to say: “The look and form must, of course, be corporeal of
him whose help is implored.” Well, let men hear what you say; and let no
one implore God’s help, because no one can possibly see anything
corporeal in Him.
