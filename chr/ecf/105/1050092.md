id="x.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[III.\]—In What Way God Commands
Nothing Impossible. Works of Mercy, Means of Wiping Out Sins.</span>

<span id="x.iv.iii-p2"></span>Now these people imagine that they are
acute (as if none among us knew it) when they say, that “if we have not
the will, we commit no sin; nor would God command man to do what was
impossible for human volition.” But they do not see, that in order to
overcome certain things, which are the objects either of an evil desire
or an ill-conceived fear, men need the <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>
<span id="x.iv.iii-Page_45"></span>strenuous efforts, and sometimes even
all the energies, of the will; and that we should only imperfectly
employ these in every instance, He foresaw who willed so true an
utterance to be spoken by the prophet: “In Thy sight shall no man living
be justified.” <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446) The Lord,
therefore, foreseeing that such would be our character, was pleased to
provide and endow with efficacious virtue certain healthful remedies
against the guilt and bonds even of sins committed after baptism,—for
instance, the works of mercy,—as when he says: “Forgive, and ye shall be
forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you.” <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447) For who could quit this life with any
hope of obtaining eternal salvation, with that sentence impending:
“Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is
guilty of all,” <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448) if there did not
soon after follow: “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged
by the law of liberty: for he shall have judgment without mercy that
hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment?” <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449)
