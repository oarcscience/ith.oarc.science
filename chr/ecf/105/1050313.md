<span id="xii.lxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 66.—The Works, Not the Substance, of
the “Flesh” Opposed to the “Spirit.”</span>

<span id="xii.lxx-p2"></span>Now if we secure even this concession from
them, that unbaptized persons may implore the assistance of the
Saviour’s grace, this is indeed no slight point against that fallacious
assertion of the self-sufficiency of nature and of the power of free
will. For he is not sufficient to himself who says, “O wretched man that
I am! who shall liberate me?” Nor can he be said to have full liberty
who still asks for liberation. \[LVI.\] But let us, moreover, see to
this point also, whether they who are baptized do the good which they
would, without any resistance from the lust of the flesh. That, however,
which we have to say on this subject, our author himself mentions, when
concluding this topic he says: “As we remarked, the passage in which
occur the words, ‘The flesh lusteth against the Spirit,’ <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290.md) must needs have reference not to
the substance, but to the works of the flesh.” We too allege that this
is spoken not of the substance of the flesh, but of its works, which
proceed from carnal concupiscence,—in a word, from sin, concerning which
we have this precept: “Not to let it reign in our mortal body, that we
should obey it in the lusts thereof.” <span
