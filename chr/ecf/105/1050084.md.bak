<span id="x.iii.lxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 66.—Infants’ Faults Spring from
Their Sheer Ignorance.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lxvi-p2"></span>I should, however, wish any one who was
wise on the point to tell me what sin he has seen or thought of in a
new-born infant, for redemption from which he allows baptism to be
already necessary; what kind of evil it has in its own proper life
committed by its own mind or body. If it should happen to cry and to be
wearisome to its elders, I wonder whether my informant would ascribe
this to iniquity, and not rather to unhappiness. What, too, would he say
to the fact that it is hushed from its very weeping by no appeal to its
own reason, and by no prohibition of any one else? This, however, comes
from the ignorance in which it is so deeply steeped, by reason of which,
too, when it grows stronger, as it very soon does, it strikes its mother
in its little passion, and often her very breasts which it sucks when it
is hungry. Well, now, these small freaks are not only borne in very
young children, but are actually loved,—and this with what affection
except that of the flesh, <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) by
which we are delighted by a laugh or a joke, seasoned with fun and
nonsense by clever persons, although, if it were understood literally,
as it is spoken, they would not be laughed with as facetious, but at as
simpletons? We see, also, how those simpletons whom the common people
call *Moriones* <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) are used for the
amusement of the sane; and that they fetch higher prices than the sane
when appraised for the slave market. So great, then, is the influence of
mere natural feeling, even over those who are by no means simpletons, in
producing amusement at another’s misfortune. Now, although a man may be
amused by another man’s silliness, he would still dislike to be a
simpleton himself; and if the father, who gladly enough looks out for,
and even provokes, such things from his own prattling boy, were to
foreknow that he would, when grown up, turn out a fool, he would without
doubt think him more to be grieved for than if he were dead. While,
however, hope remains of growth, and the light of intellect is expected
to increase with the increase of years, then the insults of young
children even to their parents seem not merely not wrong, but even
agreeable and pleasant. No prudent man, doubtless, could possibly
approve of not only not forbidding in children such conduct in word or
deed as this, as soon as they are able to be forbidden, but even of
exciting them to it, for the vain amusement of their elders. For as soon
as children are of an age to know their father and mother, they dare not
use wrong words to either, unless permitted or bidden by either, or
both. <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span
id="x.iii.lxvi-Page_42"></span>But such things can only belong to such
young children as are just striving to lisp out words, and whose minds
are just able to give some sort of motion to their tongue. Let us,
however, consider the depth of the ignorance rather of the new-born
babes, out of which, as they advance in age, they come to this merely
temporary stuttering folly,—on their road, as it were, to knowledge and
speech.
