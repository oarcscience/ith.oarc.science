<span id="xii.lxxviii-p2"></span>St. Ambrose, however, really opposes
those who say that man cannot exist without sin in the present life.
For, in order to support his statement, he avails himself of the
instance of Zacharias and Elisabeth, because they are mentioned as
“having walked in all the commandments and ordinances” of the law
“blameless.” <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) Well, but does
he for all that deny that it was by God’s grace that they did this
through our Lord Jesus Christ? It was undoubtedly by such faith in Him
that holy men lived of old, even before His death. It is He who sends
the Holy Ghost that is given to us, through whom that love is shed
abroad in our hearts whereby alone whosoever are righteous are
righteous. This same Holy Ghost the bishop expressly mentioned when he
reminds us that He is to be obtained by prayer (so that the will is not
sufficient unless it be aided by Him); thus in his hymn he says:

<span id="xii.lxxviii-p4"></span>“Votisque præstat sedulis,

<span id="xii.lxxviii-p5"></span>Sanctum mereri Spiritum,” <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) —

<span id="xii.lxxviii-p7"></span>“To those who sedulously seek He gives
to gain the Holy Spirit.”
