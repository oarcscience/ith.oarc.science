<span id="x.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—The Analogy of Grace.</span>

<span id="x.iii.x-p2"></span>No doubt all they imitate Adam who by
disobedience transgress the commandment of God; but he is one thing as
an example to those who sin because they choose; and another thing as
the progenitor of all who are born with sin. All His saints, also,
imitate Christ in the pursuit of righteousness; whence the same apostle,
whom we have already quoted, says: “Be ye imitators of me, as I am also
of Christ.” <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238) But besides this
imitation, His grace works within us our illumination and justification,
by that operation concerning which the same preacher of His \[name\]
says: “Neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but
God that giveth the <span id="page_19">p. 19</span> <span
id="x.iii.x-Page_19"></span>increase.” <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239) For by this grace He engrafts into His
body even baptized infants, who certainly have not yet become able to
imitate any one. As therefore He, in whom all are made alive, besides
offering Himself as an example of righteousness to those who imitate
Him, gives also to those who believe on Him the hidden grace of His
Spirit, which He secretly infuses even into infants; so likewise he, in
whom all die, besides being an example for imitation to those who
wilfully transgress the commandment of the Lord, depraved also in his
own person all who come of his stock by the hidden corruption of his own
carnal concupiscence. It is entirely on this account, and for no other
reason, that the apostle says: “By one man sin entered into the world,
and death by sin, and so passed upon all men; in which all have
sinned.” <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240) Now if *I* were to say
this, they would raise an objection, and loudly insist that I was
incorrect both in expression and sense; for they would perceive no sense
in these words when spoken by an ordinary man, except that sense which
they refuse to see in the apostle. Since, however, these are the words
of him to whose authority and doctrine they submit, they charge us with
slowness of understanding, while they endeavour to wrest to some
unintelligible sense words which were written in a clear and obvious
purport. “By one man,” says he, “sin entered into the world, and death
by sin.” This indicates propagation, not imitation; for if imitation
were meant, he would have said, “By the devil.” But as no one doubts, he
refers to that first man who is called Adam: “And so,” says he, “it
passed upon all men.”
