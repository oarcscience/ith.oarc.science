<span id="xiv.lxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 65.—Recapitulation of What Pelagius
Condemned.</span>

<span id="xiv.lxix-p2"></span>Let us now, by a like recapitulation,
bestow a little more attention on those subjects which the bishops said
he rejected and condemned as “contrary;” for herein especially lies the
whole of that heresy. We will entirely pass over the strange terms of
adulation which he is reported to have put into writing in praise of a
certain widow; these he denied having ever inserted in any of his
writings, or ever given utterance to, and he anathematized all who held
the opinions in question not indeed as heretics, but as fools. <span
id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) The following are the wild thickets
of this heresy, which we are sorry to see shooting out buds, nay growing
into trees, day by day:—“That <span id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md)
Adam was made mortal, and would have died whether he had sinned or not;
that Adam’s sin injured only himself, and not the human race; that the
law no less than the gospel leads to the kingdom; that new-born infants
are in the same condition that Adam was before the transgression; that
the whole human race does not, on the one hand, die in consequence of
Adam’s death and transgression, nor, on the other hand, does the whole
human race rise again through the resurrection of Christ; that infants,
even if they die unbaptized, have eternal life; that rich men, even if
baptized, unless they renounce and surrender everything, have, whatever
good they may seem to have done, nothing of it reckoned to them, neither
can they possess the kingdom of God; that <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) God’s grace and assistance are not
given for single actions, but reside in free will, and in the law and
teaching; that the grace of God is bestowed according to our merits, so
that grace really lies in the will of man, as he makes himself worthy or
unworthy of it; that men cannot be called children of God, unless they
have become entirely free from sin; that forgetfulness and ignorance do
not come under sin, as they do not happen through the will, but of
necessity; that there is no free will, if it needs the help of God,
inasmuch as every one has his proper will either to do something, or to
abstain from doing it; that our victory comes not from God’s help, but
from free will; that from what Peter says, that ‘we are partakers of the
divine nature,’ <span id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) it must
follow that the soul has the power of being without sin, just in the way
that God Himself has.” For this have I read in the eleventh chapter of
the book, which bears no title of its author, but is commonly reported
to be the work of Cœlestius,—expressed in these words: “Now how can
anybody,” asks the author, “become a *partaker* of the thing from the
condition and power of which he is distinctly declared to be a
stranger?” Accordingly, the brethren who prepared these objections
understood him to have said that man’s soul and God are of the same
nature, and to have asserted that the soul is part of God; for thus they
understood that he meant that the soul partakes of the <span
id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span id="xiv.lxix-Page_212"></span>same
condition and power as God. Moreover in the last of the objections laid
to his charge there occurs this position: “That pardon is not given to
penitents according to the grace and mercy of God, but according to
their own merits and effort, since through repentance they have been
worthy of mercy.” Now all these dogmas, and the arguments which were
advanced in support of them, were repudiated and anathematized by
Pelagius, and his conduct herein was approved of by the judges, who
accordingly pronounced that he had, by his rejection and anathema,
condemned the opinions in question as contrary to the faith. Let us
therefore rejoice—whatever may be the circumstances of the case, whether
Cœlestius laid down these theses or not, or whether Pelagius believed
them or not—that the injurious principles of this new heresy were
condemned before that ecclesiastical tribunal; and let us thank God for
such a result, and proclaim His praises.
