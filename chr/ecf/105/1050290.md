<span id="xii.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43 \[XXXVII.\]—Why Scripture Has Not
Mentioned the Sins of All.</span>

<span id="xii.xlvii-p2"></span>“But perhaps,” says he, “they will ask
me: Could not the Scripture have mentioned sins of all of these?” And
surely they would say the truth, whoever should put such a question to
him; and I do not discover that he has anywhere given a sound reply to
them, although I perceive that he was unwilling to be silent. <span
id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span id="xii.xlvii-Page_136"></span>What he
has said, I beg of you to observe: “This,” says he, “might be rightly
asked of those whom Scripture mentions neither as good nor as bad; but
of those whose holiness it commemorates, it would also without doubt
have commemorated the sins likewise, if it had perceived that they had
sinned in anything.” Let him say, then, that their great faith did not
attain to righteousness in the case of those who comprised “the
multitudes that went before and that followed” the colt on which the
Lord rode, when “they shouted and said, Hosanna to the Son of David:
Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,” <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) even amidst the malignant men who
with murmurs asked why they were doing all this! Let him then boldly
tell us, if he can, that there was not a man in all that vast crowd who
had any sin at all. Now, if it is most absurd to make such a statement
as this, why has not the Scripture mentioned any sins in the persons to
whom reference has been made, especially when it has carefully recorded
the eminent goodness of their faith?
