id="xvii.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—God Rules Everywhere: and Yet
the “Kingdom of Heaven” May Not Be Everywhere.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.xvi-p2"></span>You may, however, not improbably
contend that all things, it is true, belong to the kingdom of God,
because He reigns in heaven, reigns on earth, in the depths beneath, in
paradise, in hell (for where does He not reign, since His power is
everywhere supreme?); but that the kingdom of heaven is one thing, into
which none are permitted to enter, according to the Lord’s own true and
settled sentence, unless they are washed in the laver of regeneration,
while quite another thing is the kingdom over the earth, or over any
other parts of creation, in which there may be some mansions of God’s
house; but these, although appertaining to the kingdom of God, belong
not to that kingdom of heaven where God’s kingdom exists with an
especial excellence and blessedness; and that it hence happens that,
while no parts and mansions of God’s house can be rudely separated from
the kingdom of God, yet not all the mansions are prepared in the kingdom
of heaven; and still, even in the abodes which are not situated in the
kingdom of heaven, those may live happily, to whom, if they are even
unbaptized, God has willed to assign such habitations. They are no doubt
in the kingdom of God, although (as not having been baptized) they
cannot possibly be in the kingdom of heaven.
