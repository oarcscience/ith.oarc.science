<span id="xvii.vii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—The Points Which Victor
Thought Blameworthy in Augustin.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.ii-p2"></span>And they are these: The first, that I
did not venture to make a definite statement touching the origin of
those souls which have been given, or are being given, to human beings,
since the first man—because I confess my ignorance of the subject; the
second, because I said I was sure the soul was spirit, not body. Under
this <span id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.ii-Page_354"></span>second point, however, you have
included two grounds of censure: one, because I refused to believe the
soul to be corporeal; the other, because I affirmed it to be spirit. For
to you the soul appears both to be body and not to be spirit. I must
therefore request your attention to my own defence against your censure,
and ask you to embrace the opportunity which my self-defence affords you
of learning what points there are in yourself also which require your
amendment. Recall, then, the words of your book in which you first
mentioned my name. “I know,” you say, “many men of very great reputation
who when consulted have kept silence, or admitted nothing clearly, but
have withdrawn from their discussions everything definite when they
commence their exposition. Of such character are the contents of sundry
writings which I have read at your house by a very learned man and
renowned bishop, called Augustin. The truth is, I suppose, they have
with an overweening modesty and diffidence investigated the mysteries of
this subject, and have consumed within themselves the judgment of their
own treatises, and have professed themselves incapable of determining
anything on this point. But, I assure you, it appears to me excessively
absurd and unreasonable that a man should be a stranger to himself; or
that a person who is supposed to have acquired the knowledge of all
things, should regard himself as unknown to his very self. For what
difference is there between a man and a brute beast, if he knows not how
to discuss and determine his own quality and nature? so that there may
justly be applied to him the statement of Scripture: ‘Man, although he
was in honour, understood not; he is like the cattle, and is compared
with them.’ <span id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) For when the good
and gracious God created everything with reason and wisdom, and produced
man as a rational animal, capable of understanding, endowed with reason,
and lively with sensation,—because by His prudent arrangement He assigns
their place to all creatures which do not participate in the faculty of
reason,—what more incongruous idea could be suggested, than that God had
withheld from him the simple knowledge of himself? The wisdom of this
world, indeed, is ever aiming with much effort to attain to the
knowledge of truth; its researches, no doubt, fall short of the aim,
from its inability to know through what agency it is permitted that
truth should be ascertained; but yet there are some things on the nature
of the soul, near (I might even say, akin) to the truth which it has
attempted to discern. Under these circumstances, how unbecoming and even
shameful a thing it is, that any man of religious principle should
either have no intelligent views on this very subject, or prohibit
himself from acquiring any!”
