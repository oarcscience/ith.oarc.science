<span id="xix.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Paul First Received Grace that
He Might Win the Crown.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xiv-p2"></span>Let us return now to the Apostle Paul,
who, as we have found, obtained God’s grace, who recompenses good for
evil, without any good merits of his own, but rather with many evil
merits. Let us see what he says when his final sufferings were
approaching, writing to Timothy: “I am now ready to be offered, and the
time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight; I have
finished my course; I have kept the faith.” <span
id="fr_3032"></span>[3033](#fn_3032.md) He enumerates these as, of course,
now his good merits; so that, as after his evil merits he obtained
grace, so now, after his good merits, he might receive the crown.
Observe, therefore, what follows: “There is henceforth laid up for me,”
he says, “a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
shall give me at that day.” <span id="fr_3033"></span>[3034](#fn_3033.md)
Now, to whom should the righteous Judge award the crown, except to him
on whom the merciful Father had bestowed grace? And how could the crown
be one “of righteousness,” unless the grace had preceded which
“justifieth the ungodly”? How, moreover, could these things now be
awarded as of debt, unless the other had been before given as a free
gift?
