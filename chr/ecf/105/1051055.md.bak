<span id="xxi.ii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[X\]—In What Respects
Predestination and Grace Differ.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xix-p2"></span>Moreover, that which I said, “That the
salvation of this religion has never been lacking to him who was worthy
of it, and that he to whom it was lacking was not worthy,”—if it be
discussed and it be asked whence any man can be worthy, there are not
wanting those who say—by human will. But we say, by divine grace or
predestination. Further, between grace and predestination there is only
this difference, that predestination is the preparation for grace, while
grace is the donation itself. When, therefore the apostle says, “Not of
works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in
Christ Jesus in good works,” <span id="fr_3483"></span>[3484](#fn_3483.md)
it is grace; but what follows—“which God hath prepared that we should
walk in them”—is predestination, which cannot exist without
foreknowledge, although foreknowledge may exist without predestination;
because God foreknew by predestination those things which He was about
to do, whence it was said, “He made those things that shall be.” <span
id="fr_3484"></span>[3485](#fn_3484.md) Moreover, He is able to foreknow
even those things which He does not Himself do,—as all sins whatever.
Because, although there are some which are in such wise sins as that
they are also the penalties of sins, whence it is said, “God gave them
over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
convenient,” <span id="fr_3485"></span>[3486](#fn_3485.md) it is not in
such a case the sin that is God’s, but the judgment. Therefore God’s
predestination of good is, as I have said, the preparation of grace;
which grace is the effect of that predestination. Therefore when God
promised to Abraham in his seed the faith of the nations, <span
id="page_508">p. 508</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.xix-Page_508"></span>saying, “I have established thee a
father of many nations,” <span id="fr_3486"></span>[3487](#fn_3486.md)
whence the apostle says, “Therefore it is of faith, that the promise,
according to grace, might be established to all the seed,” <span
id="fr_3487"></span>[3488](#fn_3487.md) He promised not from the power of
our will but from His own predestination. For He promised what He
Himself would do, not what men would do. Because, although men do those
good things which pertain to God’s worship, He Himself makes them to do
what He has commanded; it is not they that cause Him to do what He has
promised. Otherwise the fulfilment of God’s promises would not be in the
power of God, but in that of men; and thus what was promised by God to
Abraham would be given to Abraham by men themselves. Abraham, however,
did not believe thus, but “he believed, giving glory to God, that what
He promised He is able also to do.” <span
id="fr_3488"></span>[3489](#fn_3488.md) He does not say, “to foretell”—he
does not say, “to foreknow;” for He can foretell and foreknow the doings
of strangers also; but he says, “He is able also to do;” and thus he is
speaking not of the doings of others, but of His own.
