Life by One.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xvi-p2"></span>And from this we gather that we have
derived from Adam, in whom we all have sinned, not all our actual sins,
but only original sin; whereas from Christ, in whom we are all
justified, we obtain the remission not merely of that original sin, but
of the rest of our sins also, which we have added. Hence it runs: “Not
as by the one that sinned, so also is the free gift.” For the judgment,
certainly, from one sin, if it is not remitted—and that the original
sin—is capable of drawing us into condemnation; whilst grace conducts us
to justification from the remission of many sins,—that is to say, not
simply from the original sin, but from all others also whatsoever.
