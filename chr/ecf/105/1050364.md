<span id="xiii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>(28.) When Our Heart May Be Said Not to
Reproach Us; When Good is to Be Perfected.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxxii-p2"></span>Furthermore, concerning these words of
Job, “My heart shall not reproach me in all my life,” <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475) we remark, that it is in this
present life of ours, in which we live by faith, that our heart does not
reproach us, if the same faith whereby we believe unto righteousness
does not neglect to rebuke our sin. On this principle the apostle says:
“The good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I
do.” <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476) Now it is a good thing
to avoid concupiscence, and this good the just man would, who lives by
faith; <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477) and still he does what
he hates, because he has concupiscence, although “he goes not after his
lusts;” <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478) if he has done this,
he has himself at that time really done it, so as to yield to, and
acquiesce in, and obey the desire of sin. His heart then reproaches him,
because it reproaches himself, and not his sin which dwelleth in him.
But whensoever he suffers not sin to reign in his mortal body to obey it
in the lusts thereof, <span id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479) and
yields not his members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480) sin no doubt is present in his
members, but it does not reign, because its desires are not obeyed.
Therefore, while he does that which he would not,—in other words, while
he wishes not to lust, but still lusts,—he consents to the law that it
is good: <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481) for what the law
would, that he also wishes; because it is his desire not to indulge
concupiscence, and the law expressly says, “Thou shalt not covet.” <span
id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482) Now in that he wishes what the law
also would have done, he no doubt consents to the law: but still he
lusts, because he is not without sin; it is, however, no longer himself
that does the thing, but the sin which dwells within him. Hence it is
that “his heart does not reproach him in all his life;” that is, in his
faith, because the just man lives by faith, so that his faith is his
very life. He knows, to be sure, that in himself dwells nothing
good,—even in his flesh, which is the dwelling-place of sin. By not
consenting, however, to it, he lives by faith, wherewith he also calls
upon God to help him in his contest against sin. Moreover, there is
present to him to will that no sin at all should be in him, but then how
to perfect this good is <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> <span
id="xiii.xxxii-Page_169"></span>not present. It is not the mere “doing”
of a good thing that is not present to him, but the “perfecting” of it.
For in this, that he yields no consent, he does good; he does good
again, in this, that he hates his own lust; he does good also, in this,
that he does not cease to give alms; and in this, that he forgives the
man who sins against him, he does good; and in this, that he asks
forgiveness for his own trespasses,—sincerely avowing in his petition
that he also forgives those who trespass against himself, and praying
that he may not be led into temptation, but be delivered from evil,—he
does good. But how to perfect the good is not present to him; it will
be, however, in that final state, when the concupiscence which dwells in
his members shall exist no more. His heart, therefore, does not reproach
him, when it reproaches the sin which dwells in his members; nor can it
reproach unbelief in him. Thus “in all his life,”—that is, in his
faith,—he is neither reproached by his own heart, nor convinced of not
being without sin. And Job himself acknowledges this concerning himself,
when he says, “Not one of my sins hath escaped Thee; Thou hast sealed up
my transgressions in a bag, and marked if I have done iniquity
unawares.” <span id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483) With regard, then,
to the passages which he has adduced from the book of holy Job, we have
shown to the best of our ability in what sense they ought to be taken.
He, however, has failed to explain the meaning of the words which he has
himself quoted from the same Job: “Who then is pure from uncleanness?
Not one; even if he be an infant of only one day upon the earth.” <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484)
