<span id="xxi.ii-p7"></span>————————————

<span id="xxi.ii-p8"></span>*Wherein the truth of predestination and
grace is defended against the semi-Pelagians,—those people to wit, who
by no means withdraw altogether from the Pelagian heresy, in that they
contend that the beginning of salvation and of faith is of ourselves; so
that in virtue, as it were, of this precedent merit, the other good
gifts of God are attained. Augustin shows that not only the increase,
but the very beginning also of faith is in God’s gift. On this matter he
does not disavow that he once thought differently, and that in some
small works, written before his episcopate, he was in error, as in that
exposition, which they object to him, of propositions from the epistle
to the Romans. But he points out that he was subsequently convinced
chiefly by this testimony, “but what hast thou that thou hast not
received?” which he proves is to be taken as a testimony concerning
faith itself also. He says that faith is to be counted among other
works, which the apostle denies to anticipate God’s grace when He says,
“not of works.” He declares that the hardness of the heart is taken away
by grace, and that all come to Christ who are taught to come by the
Father; but that those whom He teaches, He teaches in mercy, while those
whom He teaches not, in judgment He teaches not. That the passage from
his hundred and second epistle, Question 2, “concerning the time of the
Christian religion” which is alleged by the semi-Pelagians, may rightly
be explained without detriment to the doctrine of grace and
predestination. He teaches what is the difference between grace and
predestination. Further, he says that God in his predestination foreknew
what he had purposed to do. He marvels greatly that the adversaries of
predestination, who are said to be unwilling to be dependent on the
uncertainty of God’s will, prefer rather to trust themselves to their
own weakness than to* <span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="xxi.ii-Page_498"></span>*the strength of God’s promise. He clearly
points out that they abuse this authority, “If thou believest, thou
shalt be saved.” That the truth of grace and perseverance shines forth
in the case of infants that are saved, who are distinguished by no
merits of their own from others who perish. For that there is no
difference between them arising from the foreknowledge of merits which
they would have had if they had lived longer. That testimony is
wrongfully rejected by the adversaries as being uncanonical, which he
adduced for the purpose of this discussion, “he was taken away lest
wickedness,” etc. That the most illustrious instance of predestination
and grace is the Saviour Himself, in whom a man obtained the privilege
of being the Saviour and the Only-begotten Son of God, through being
assumed into oneness of person by the Word co-eternal with the Father,
on account of no precedent merits, either of works or of faith. That the
predestinated are called by some certain calling peculiar to the elect,
and that they have been elected before the foundation of the world; not
because they were foreknown as men who would believe and would be holy,
but in order that by means of that very election of grace they might be
such, etc.*
