<span id="xviii.vi.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—The Praise of the
Creature.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.ii-p2"></span>They accomplish the praise of the
creature, inasmuch as it pertains to the human race of <span
id="page_417">p. 417</span> <span id="xviii.vi.ii-Page_417"></span>which
the question now is, in these statements: “That God is the Maker of all
those that are born, and that the sons of men are God’s work; and that
all sin descends not from nature, but from the will.” With this praise
of the creature they connect, “that they say that baptism is necessary
for every age, so that,” namely, “the creature itself may be adopted
among the children of God; not because it derives anything from its
parents which must be purified in the laver of regeneration.” To this
praise they add also, “that they say that Christ the Lord was sprinkled
with no stain of sin as far as pertains to His infancy;” because they
assert that His flesh was most pure from all contagion of sin, not by
His own excellence and singular grace, but by His fellowship with the
nature which is shared by all infants. It also belongs to this that they
introduce the question “of the origin of the soul,” thus endeavouring to
make all the souls of infants equal to the soul of Christ, maintaining
that they likewise are sprinkled with no stain of sin. On this account,
also, they say, “that nothing of evil passed from Adam upon the rest of
humanity except death, which,” they say, “is not always an evil, since
to the martyrs, for instance, it is for the sake of rewards; and it is
not the dissolution of the bodies, which in every kind of men shall be
raised up, that can make death to be called either good or evil, but the
diversity of merits which arises from human liberty.” These things they
write in this letter concerning the praise of the creature.

<span id="xviii.vi.ii-p3"></span>They praise marriage truly according to
the Scriptures, “because the Lord saith in the gospel, He who made men
from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Increase and
multiply, and replenish the earth.” Although this is not written in that
passage of the gospel, yet it is written in the law. They add, moreover,
“What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.” <span id="fr_2774"></span>[2775](#fn_2774) And these we
acknowledge to be gospel words.

<span id="xviii.vi.ii-p5"></span>In the praise of the law they say,
“that the old law was, according to the apostle, holy and just and good;
that on those who keep its commandments, and live righteously by faith,
such as the prophets and patriarchs, and all the saints, life eternal
could be conferred.”

<span id="xviii.vi.ii-p6"></span>In the praise of free will they say,
“that free will has not perished, since the Lord says by the prophets,
‘If ye be willing and will hear me, ye shall eat the good things of the
land: if ye are unwilling, and will not hear, the sword shall devour
you.’ <span id="fr_2775"></span>[2776](#fn_2775) And thus, also, it is
that grace assists the good purpose of any person, but yet does not
infuse a desire of virtue into the reluctant heart, because there is no
acceptance of persons with God.”

<span id="xviii.vi.ii-p8"></span>In the praise of the saints they
conceal themselves, saying “that baptism perfectly renews men, inasmuch
as the apostle is a witness who testifies that, by the washing of water,
the Church is made out of the heathen holy and spotless; <span
id="fr_2776"></span>[2777](#fn_2776) that the Holy Spirit also assisted
pious souls in ancient times, even as the prophet says to God, ‘Thy good
Spirit shall lead me into the right way;’ <span
id="fr_2777"></span>[2778](#fn_2777) that all the prophets, moreover,
and apostles or saints, as well of the New as of the Old Testament, to
whom God gives witness, were righteous, not in comparison with the
wicked, but by the rule of virtue; and that in future time there is a
reward as well of good works as of evil. But that no one can then
perform the commandment which here he may have contemned, because the
apostle said, ‘We must be manifested before the judgment-seat of Christ,
that every one may receive the things belonging to the body, according
to what he has done, whether good or evil.’” <span
id="fr_2778"></span>[2779](#fn_2778)

<span id="xviii.vi.ii-p12"></span>In all these points, whatever they say
of the praise of the creature and of marriage, they endeavour to bring
us back to this,—that there is no original sin; whatever of the praise
of law and of free will, to this, that grace does not assist without
merit, and that thus grace is no more grace; whatever of the praise of
the saints, to this, that mortal life in the saints appears not to have
sin, and that it is not necessary for them to pray God for the remitting
of their debts.
