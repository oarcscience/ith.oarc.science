id="xii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XXXIII.\]—Being Wholly Without Sin
Does Not Put Man on an Equality with God.</span>

<span id="xii.xli-p2"></span>But God forbid that we should meet him with
such an assertion as he says certain persons advance against him: “That
man is placed on an equality with God, if he is described as being
without sin;” as if indeed an angel, because he is without sin, is put
in such an equality. For my own part, I am of this opinion that the
creature will never become equal with God, even when so perfect a
holiness shall be accomplished in us, that it shall be quite incapable
of receiving any addition. No; all who maintain that our progress is to
be so complete that we shall be changed into the substance of God, and
that we shall thus become what He is, should look well to it how they
build up their opinion; for myself I must confess that I am not
persuaded of this.
