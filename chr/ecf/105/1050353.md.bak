<span id="xiii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—(17.) It is One Thing to Depart
from the Body, Another Thing to Be Liberated from the Body of This
Death.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxi-p2"></span>He next proposes to establish his point by
the testimony of Holy Scripture. Let us carefully observe what kind of
defence he makes. “There are passages,” says he, “which prove that man
is commanded to be without sin.” Now our answer to this is: Whether such
commands are given is not at all the point in question, for the fact is
clear enough; but whether the thing which is evidently commanded be
itself at all possible of accomplishment in the body of this death,
wherein “the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
the flesh, so that we cannot do the things that we would.” <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) Now from this body of death not
every one is liberated who ends the present life, but only he who in
this life has received grace, and given proof of not receiving it in
vain by spending his days in good works. For it is plainly one thing to
depart from the body, which all men are obliged to do in the last day of
their present life, and another to be delivered from the body of this
death,—which God’s grace alone, through our Lord Jesus Christ, imparts
to His faithful saints. It is after this life, indeed, that the reward
of perfection is bestowed, but only upon those by whom in their present
life has been acquired the merit of such a recompense. For no one, after
going hence, shall arrive at fulness of righteousness, unless, whilst
here, he shall have run his course by hungering and thirsting after it.
“Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for
they shall be filled.” <span id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md)
