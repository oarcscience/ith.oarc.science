id="x.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Wherein the Pharisee Sinned When He
Thanked God; To God’s Grace Must Be Added the Exertion of Our Own
Will.</span>

<span id="x.iv.vi-p2"></span>Let us then drive away from our ears and
minds those who say that we ought to accept the determination of our own
free will and not pray God to help us not to sin. By such darkness as
this even the Pharisee was not blinded; for although he erred in
thinking that he needed no addition to his righteousness, and supposed
himself to be saturated with abundance of it, he nevertheless gave
thanks to God that he was not “like other men, unjust, extortioners,
adulterers, or even as the publican; for he fasted twice in the week, he
gave tithes of all that he possessed.” <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) He wished, indeed, for no addition to
his own righteousness; but yet, by giving thanks to God, he confessed
that all he had he had received from Him. Notwithstanding, he was not
approved, both because he asked for no further food of righteousness, as
if he were already filled, and because he arrogantly preferred himself
to the publican, who was hungering and thirsting after righteousness.
What, then, is to be said of those who, whilst acknowledging that they
have no righteousness, or no fulness thereof, yet imagine that it is to
be had from themselves alone, not to be besought from their Creator, in
whom is its store and its fountain? And yet this is not a question about
prayers alone, as if the energy of our will also should not be
strenuously added. God is said to be “*our Helper*;” <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) but nobody can be *helped* who does
not make some effort of his own accord. For God does not work our
salvation in us as if he were working in insensate stones, or in
creatures in whom nature has placed neither reason nor will. Why,
however, He helps one man, but not another; or why one man so much, and
another so much; or why one man in one way, and another in another,—He
reserves to Himself according to the method of His own most secret
justice, and to the excellency of His power.
