<p><a name="xvi.vi.iii-p2"></A>The paper which I now answer starts with this title: &#8220;<i>Headings out of a book written by Augustin, in reply to which I have culled a few passages out of books</i>.&#8221; I perceive from this that the person who forwarded these written papers to your Excellency wanted to make his extracts out of the books he does not name, with a view, so far as I can judge, to getting a quicker answer, in order that he might not delay your urgency. Now, after considering what books they were which he meant, I suppose that it must have been those which Julianus mentioned in the Epistle he sent to Rome,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2193"></A><A HREF="#fn_2193"><FONT SIZE="1">2194</FONT></A>
 a copy of which found its way to me at the same time. For he there says: &#8220;They go so far as to allege that marriage, now in dispute, was not instituted by God,&#8212;a declaration which may be read in a work of Augustin&#146;s, to which I have lately replied in a treatise of four books.&#8221; These are the books, as I believe, from which the extracts were taken. It would, then, have been perhaps the better course if I had set myself deliberately to disprove and refute that entire work of his,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2194"></A><A HREF="#fn_2194"><FONT SIZE="1">2195</FONT></A>
 which he spread out into four volumes. But I was most unwilling to delay my answer, even as you yourself lost no time in forwarding to me the written statements which I was requested to reply to.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xvi.vi.iii-p4"></A> This Augustin afterwards did by the publication of six book against Julianus, on receiving his entire work. Augustin tells us (<i>Unfinished Work</i>, i. 19) that he had long endeavoured to procure a copy of Julianus&#146; books for the purpose of refuting them, and only succeeded in getting them after some difficulty and delay.</p>
