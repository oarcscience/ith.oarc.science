Calumnies of the Pelagians.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.ix-p2"></span>And now we must look to those things
which they objected to us in their letters, and briefly mentioned. And
to these this is my answer. We do not say that by the sin of Adam free
will perished out of the nature of men; but that it avails for sinning
in men subjected to the devil; while it is not of avail for good and
pious living, unless the will itself of man should be made free by God’s
grace, and assisted to every good movement of action, of speech, of
thought. We say that no one but the Lord God is the maker of those who
are born, and that marriage was ordained not by the devil, but by God
Himself; yet that all are born under sin on account of the fault of
propagation, and that, therefore, all are under the devil until they are
born again in Christ. Nor are we maintaining fate under the name of
grace, because we say that the grace of God is preceded by no merits of
man. If, however, it is agreeable to any to call the will of the
Almighty God by the name of fate, while we indeed shun profane novelties
of words, we have no use for contending about words.
