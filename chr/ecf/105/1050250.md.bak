<span id="xii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[III.\]—Nature Was Created Sound and
Whole; It Was Afterwards Corrupted by Sin.</span>

<span id="xii.vii-p2"></span>Man’s nature, indeed, was created at first
faultless and without any sin; but that nature of man in which every one
is born from Adam, now wants the Physician, because it is not sound. All
good qualities, no doubt, which it still possesses in its make, life,
senses, intellect, it has of the Most High God, its Creator and Maker.
But the flaw, which darkens and weakens all those natural goods, so that
it has need of illumination and healing, it has not contracted from its
blameless Creator—but from that original sin, which it committed by free
will. Accordingly, criminal nature has its part in most righteous
punishment. For, if we are now newly created in Christ, <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) we were, for all that, children of
wrath, even as others, <span id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md) “but
God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us,
even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ,
by whose grace we were saved.” <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md)
