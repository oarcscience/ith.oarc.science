id="xvi.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[VIII.\]—The Pelagians
Misunderstand “Seed” In Scripture.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xx-p2"></span>He goes on to say: “After a while the
divine Scripture says again, ‘Adam knew Eve his wife; and she bare a
son, and he called his name Seth: saying, The Lord hath raised me up
another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.’” He then adds: “The
Divinity is said to have raised up the seed itself; as a proof that the
sexual union was His appointment.” This person did not understand what
the Scripture records; for he supposed that the reason why it is said,
The Lord hath raised me up another seed instead of Abel, was none other
than that God might be supposed to have excited in him a desire for
sexual intercourse, by means whereof seed might be raised for being
poured into the woman’s womb. He was perfectly unaware that what the
Scripture has said is not “Has raised me up seed” in the sense he uses,
but only as meaning “Has given me a son.” Indeed, Adam did not use the
words in question after his sexual intercourse, when he emitted his
seed, but after his wife’s confinement, in which he received his son by
the gift of God. For what gratification is there (except perhaps for
lascivious persons, and those who, as the apostle says with prohibition,
“possess their vessel in the lust of concupiscence” <span
id="fr_2236"></span>[2237](#fn_2236) ) in the mere shedding of seed as
the ultimate pleasure of sexual union, unless it is followed by the true
and proper fruit of marriage—conception and birth?
