<span id="xviii.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—The Apostle Meets the Question
by Leaving It Unsolved.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xv-p2"></span>Since in the case of those two twins we
have without a doubt one and the same case, the difficulty of the
question why the one died in one way, and the other in another, is
solved by the apostle as it were by not solving it; for, when he had
proposed something of the same kind about two twins, seeing that it was
said (not of works, since they had not as yet done anything either of
good or of evil, but of Him that calleth), “The older shall serve the
younger,”  <span id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643) and, “Jacob have I
loved, and Esau have I hated;” <span
id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644) and he had prolonged the horror of
this deep thing even to the point of saying, “Therefore hath He mercy on
whom He will, and whom He will He hardeneth:” <span
id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645) he perceived at once what the
trouble was, and opposed to himself the words of a gainsayer which he
was to check by apostolical authority. For he says, “You say, then, unto
me, “Why doth He yet find fault? For who has resisted His will?” And to
him who says this he answered, “O man, who art thou that repliest
against God? Doth the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast
thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power of the clay of the same
lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?” <span
id="fr_2646"></span>[2647](#fn_2646) Then, following on, he opened up
this great and hidden secret as far as he judged it fit that it should
be disclosed to men, saying, “But if God, willing to show His wrath and
to demonstrate His power, endured in much patience the vessels of wrath
fitted for destruction, even that He might make known the riches of His
glory on the vessels of mercy which He has prepared for glory.” <span
id="fr_2647"></span>[2648](#fn_2647) This is not only the assistance,
but, moreover, the proof of God’s grace—the assistance, namely, in the
vessels of mercy, but the proof in the vessels of wrath; for in these He
shows His anger and makes known His power, because His goodness is so
mighty that He even uses the evil well; and in those He makes known the
riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, because what the justice of
a punisher requires from the vessels of wrath, the grace of the
Deliverer remits to the vessels of mercy. Nor would the kindness which
is bestowed on some freely appear, unless to other equally guilty and
from the same mass God showed what was really due to both, and condemned
them with a righteous judgment. “For who maketh thee to differ?” <span
id="fr_2648"></span>[2649](#fn_2648) says the same apostle to a man as
it were boasting concerning himself and his own benefits. “For who
maketh thee to differ” from the vessels of wrath; of course, from the
mass of perdition which has sent all by one into damnation? “Who maketh
thee to differ?” And as if he had answered, “My faith maketh me to
differ,—my purpose, my merit,”—he says, “For what hast thou which thou
hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou boast as
if thou receivedst it not?”—that is, as if that by which thou art made
to differ were of thine own. Therefore He maketh thee to differ who
bestows that whence thou art made to differ, by removing the penalty
that is due, by conferring the grace which is not due. He maketh to
differ, who, when the darkness was upon the face of the abyss, said,
“Let there be light; and there was light, and divided”—that is, made to
differ—“between the light and the darkness.” <span
id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649) For when there was only darkness,
He did not find what He should make to differ; but by making the light,
He made to differ; so that it may be said to the justified wicked, “For
ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_2650"></span>[2651](#fn_2650) And thus he who glories must glory
not in himself, but in the Lord. He makes to differ who—of those who are
not yet born, and who have not yet done any good or evil, that His
purpose, according to the election, might stand not of works, but of
Himself that calleth—said, The older shall serve the younger, and
commending that very purpose afterwards by the mouth of the prophet,
said, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” <span
id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651) Because he said “the election,” and
in this God does not find made by another what He may choose, but
Himself makes what He may find; just as it is written of the remnant of
Israel: “There is made a remnant by the election of grace; but if by
grace, then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no more
grace.” <span id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652) On which account you
are certainly foolish who, when the Truth declares, “Not of works, but
of Him that calleth, it was said,” say that Jacob was loved on account
of future works which God foreknew that he would do, and thus contradict
the apostle when he says, “Not of works;” as if he could not have said,
“Not of present, but of future works.” But he says, “Not of works,” that
He might commend grace; “but if of grace, now is it no more of works,
otherwise grace is no more grace.” For grace, not due, but free,
precedes, that by it good works may be done; but if good works should
precede, grace should be repaid, as it were, to works, and thus grace
should be no more grace.
