<span id="xix.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Faith is the Gift of
God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>I have already discussed <span
id="fr_3094"></span>[3095](#fn_3094.md) the point concerning faith, that
is, concerning the will of him who believes, even so far as to show that
it appertains to grace,—so that the apostle did not tell us, “I have
obtained mercy because I was faithful;” but he said, “I have obtained
mercy in order to be faithful.” <span
id="fr_3095"></span>[3096](#fn_3095.md) And there are many other passages
of similar import,—among them that in which he bids us “think soberly,
according as God hath dealt out to every man the proportion of
faith;” <span id="fr_3096"></span>[3097](#fn_3096.md) and that which I have
already quoted: “By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves; it is the gift of God;” <span
id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097.md) and again another in the same
Epistle to the Ephesians: “Peace be to the brethren, and love with
faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ;” <span
id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098.md) and to the same effect that passage
in which he says, “For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not
only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.” <span
id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099.md) Both alike are therefore due to the
grace of God,—the faith of those who believe, and the patience of those
who suffer, because the apostle spoke of both as *given*. Then, again,
there is the passage, especially noticeable, in which he says, “We,
having the same spirit of faith,” <span
id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100.md) for his phrase is not “*the
knowledge of faith*,” but “*the spirit of faith;*” and he expressed
himself thus in order that we might understand how that faith is given
to us, even when it is not sought, so that other blessings may be
granted to it at its request. For “how,” says he, “shall they call upon
Him in whom they have not believed?” <span
id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101.md) The spirit of grace, therefore,
causes us to have faith, in order that through faith we may, on praying
for it, obtain the ability to do what we are commanded. On this account
the apostle himself constantly puts faith before the law; since we are
not able to do what the law commands unless we obtain the strength to do
it by the prayer of faith.
