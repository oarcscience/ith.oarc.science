<p><a name="xx.ix-p2"></A>&#8220;How,&#8221; says he,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3257"></A><A HREF="#fn_3257"><FONT SIZE="1">3258</FONT></A>
 &#8220;is it my fault that I have not what I have not received from Him, when unless it is given by Him, there is no other at all whence such and so great a gift can be had?&#8221; Suffer me a little, my brethren, not as against you whose heart is right with God, but as against those who mind earthly things, or as against those human modes of thinking themselves, to contend for the truth, of the heavenly and divine grace. For they who say this are such as in their wicked works are unwilling to be rebuked by those who proclaim this grace. &#8220;Prescribe to me what I shall do, and if I should do it, give thanks to God for me who has given me to do it; but if I do it not, I must not be rebuked, but He must be besought to give what He has not given; that is, that very believing love of God and of my neighbour by which His precepts are&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3258"></A><A HREF="#fn_3258"><FONT SIZE="1">3259</FONT></A>
 observed. Pray, then, for me that I may receive this, and may by its means do freely and with good will that which He commands. But I should be justly rebuked if by my own fault I had it not; that is, if I myself could give it to myself, or could receive it, and did not do so, or if He should give it and I should be unwilling to receive it. But since even the will itself is prepared&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3259"></A><A HREF="#fn_3259"><FONT SIZE="1">3260</FONT></A>
 by the Lord, why dust thou rebuke me because thou seeest me unwilling to do His precepts, and dust not rather ask Him Himself to work in me the will also?&#8221;</p>
