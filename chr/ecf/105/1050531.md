Falsehood in Ambiguous Subterfuges.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xx-p2"></span>And then observe how he makes his answer,
how he provides in the obscure mazes of his double sense retreats for
his false doctrine, quenching the truth in his dark mist of error; so
that even we, on our first perusal of his words, almost rejoiced at
their propriety and correctness. But the fuller discussions in his
books, in which he is generally forced, in spite of all his efforts at
concealment, to explain his meaning, have made even his better
statements suspicious to us, lest on a closer inspection of them we
should detect them to be ambiguous. For, after saying that “he had never
heard even an impious heretic say this” (namely, what he set forth as
the objection) “about infants,” he goes on to ask: “Who indeed is so
unacquainted with Gospel lessons, as not only to attempt to make such an
affirmation, but even to be able to lightly say it or even let it enter
his thought? And then who is so impious as to wish to exclude infants
from the kingdom of heaven, by forbidding them to be baptized and to be
born again in Christ?”
