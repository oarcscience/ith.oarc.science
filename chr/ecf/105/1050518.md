Him.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.vii-p2"></span>The bishop, however, who presides over
this See, upon seeing him hurrying headlong in so great presumption like
a madman, chose in his great compassion, with a view to the man’s
repentance, if it might be, rather to bind him tightly by eliciting from
him answers to questions proposed by himself, than by the stroke of a
severe condemnation to drive him over the precipice, down which he
seemed to be even now ready to fall. I say advisedly, “down which he
seemed to be ready to fall,” rather than “over which he had actually
fallen,” because he had already in this same book of his forecast the
subject with an intended reference to questions of this sort in the
following words: “If it should so happen that any error of ignorance has
stolen over us human beings, let it be corrected by your decisive
sentence.”
