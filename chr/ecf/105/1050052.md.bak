<span id="x.iii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34 \[XXIV.\]—Baptism is Called
Salvation, and the Eucharist, Life, by the Christians of
Carthage.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxxiv-p2"></span>The Christians of Carthage have an
excellent name for the sacraments, when they say that baptism is nothing
else than “salvation,” and the sacrament of the body of Christ nothing
else than “life.” Whence, however, was this derived, but from that
primitive, as I suppose, and apostolic tradition, by which the Churches
of Christ maintain it to be an inherent principle, that without baptism
and partaking of the supper of the Lord it is impossible for any man to
attain either to the kingdom of God or to salvation and everlasting
life? So much also does Scripture testify, according to the words which
we already quoted. For wherein does their opinion, who designate baptism
by the term *salvation*, differ from what is written: “He *saved us* by
the washing of regeneration?” <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) or
from Peter’s statement: “The like figure whereunto even baptism doth
also *now save us?*” <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) And what
else do they say who call the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper *life*,
than that which is written: “I am the *living* bread which came down
from heaven;” <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) and “The bread
that I shall give is my flesh, for *the life* of the world;” <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) and “Except ye eat the flesh of the
Son of man, and drink His blood, ye shall have no life in you?” <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) If, therefore, as so many and such
divine witnesses agree, neither salvation nor eternal life can be hoped
for by any man without baptism and the Lord’s body and blood, it is vain
to promise these blessings to infants without them. Moreover, if it be
only sins that separate man from salvation and eternal life, there is
nothing else in infants which these sacraments can be the means of
removing, but the guilt of sin,—respecting which guilty nature it is
written, that “no one is clean, not even if his life be only that of a
day.” <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) Whence also that
exclamation of the Psalmist: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in
sin did my mother conceive me!” <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md)
This is either said in the person of our common humanity, or if of
himself only David speaks, it does not imply that he was born of
fornication, but in lawful wedlock. We therefore ought not to doubt that
even for infants yet to be baptized was that precious blood shed, which
previous to its actual effusion was so given, and applied in the
sacrament, that it was said, “This is my blood, which shall be shed for
many for the remission of sins.” <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md)
Now they who will not allow that they are under sin, deny that there is
any liberation. For what is there that men are liberated from, if they
are held to be bound by no bondage of sin?
