<span id="x.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—The Beginning of Renewal;
Resurrection Called Regeneration; They are the Sons of God Who Lead
Lives Suitable to Newness of Life.</span>

<span id="x.iv.ix-p2"></span>And hence in the passage, “Whosoever is
born of God doth not sin, and he cannot sin, for His seed remaineth in
him,” <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) and in every other passage
of like import, they much deceive themselves by an inadequate
consideration of the Scriptures. For they fail to observe that men
severally become sons of God when they begin to live in newness of
spirit, and to be renewed as to the inner man after the image of Him
that created them. <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) For it is not
from the moment of a man’s baptism that all his old infirmity is
destroyed, but renovation begins with the remission of all his sins, and
so far as he who is now wise is spiritually wise. All things else,
however, are accomplished in hope, looking forward to their being also
realized in fact, <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) even to the
renewal of the body itself in that better state of immortality and
incorruption with which we shall be clothed at the resurrection of the
dead. For this too the Lord calls a regeneration,—though, of course, not
such as occurs through baptism, but still a regeneration wherein that
which is now begun in the spirit shall be brought to perfection also in
the body. “In the regeneration,” says He, “when the Son of man shall sit
in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) For however entire and full be the
remission of sins in baptism, nevertheless, if there was wrought by it
at once, an entire and full change of the man into his everlasting
newness,—I do not mean change in his body, which is now most clearly
tending evermore to the old corruption and to death, after which it is
to be renewed into <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span
id="x.iv.ix-Page_48"></span>a total and true newness,—but, the body
being excepted, if in the soul itself, which is the inner man, a perfect
renewal was wrought in baptism, the apostle would not say: “Even though
our outward man perishes, yet the inward man is renewed day by
day.” <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) Now, undoubtedly, he who
is still renewed day by day is not as yet wholly renewed; and in so far
as he is not yet wholly renewed, he is still in his old state. Since,
then, men, even after they are baptized, are still in some degree in
their old condition, they are on that account also still children of the
world; but inasmuch as they are also admitted into a new state, that is
to say, by the full and perfect remission of their sins, and in so far
as they are spiritually-minded, and behave correspondingly, they are the
children of God. Internally we put off the old man and put on the new;
for we then and there lay aside lying, and speak truth, and do those
other things wherein the apostle makes to consist the putting off of the
old man and the putting on of the new, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness. <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md)
Now it is men who are already baptized and faithful whom he exhorts to
do this,—an exhortation which would be unsuitable to them, if the
absolute and perfect change had been already made in their baptism. And
yet made it was, since we were then actually *saved*; for “He saved us
by the laver of regeneration.” <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md)
In another passage, however, he tells us how this took place. “Not they
only,” says he, “but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the
Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the
adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope:
but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet
hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
wait for it.” <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md)
