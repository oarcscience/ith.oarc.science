<span id="xviii.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—What is Meant Under the Name
of Fate.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xii-p2"></span>Because they who affirm fate contend
that not only actions and events, but, moreover, our very wills
themselves depend on the position of the stars at the time in which one
is conceived or born; which positions they call “constellations.” But
the grace of God stands above not only all stars and all heavens, but,
moreover, all angels. In a word, the assertors of fate attribute both
men’s good and evil doings and fortunes to fate; but God in the ill
fortunes of men follows up their merits with due retribution, while good
fortunes He bestows by undeserved grace with a merciful will; doing both
the one and the other not according to a temporal conjunction of stars,
but according to the eternal and high counsel of His severity and
goodness. We see, then, that neither belongs to fate. Here, if you
answer that this very benevolence of God, by which He follows not
merits, but bestows undeserved benefits with gratuitous bounty, should
rather be called “fate,” when the apostle calls this “grace,” saying,
“By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, but it
is the gift of God; not of works, lest perchance any one should be
lifted up,” <span id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639) —do you not
consider, do you not perceive that it is not by us that fate is asserted
under the name of grace, but it is rather by you that divine grace is
called by the name of fate?
