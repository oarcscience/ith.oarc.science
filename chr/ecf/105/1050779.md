<span id="xvii.vii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XVI.\]—Figurative Speech
Must Not Be Taken Literally.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxiii-p2"></span>“In short,” you say, “members are in
this parable ascribed to the soul, as if it were really a body.” You
will have it, that “by the eye the whole head is understood,” because it
is said, that “he lifted up his eyes.” Again you say, that “by tongues
are meant jaws, and by finger the hand,” because it is said, “Send
Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my
tongue.” <span id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) And yet to save
yourself from the inconsistency of ascribing corporeal qualities to God,
you say that “by these terms must be understood incorporeal functions
and powers;” because with the greatest propriety you insist on it, that
God is not corporeal. What is the reason, therefore, that the names of
these limbs do not argue corporeity in God, although they do in the case
of the soul? Is it that these terms must be understood literally when
spoken of the creature, and only metaphorically and figuratively when
predicated of the Creator? Then you will have to give us wings of
literal bodily substance, since it is not the Creator, but only a human
creature, who said, “If I should take my wings like a dove.” <span
id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) Moreover, if the rich man of the
parable had a bodily tongue, on the ground of his exclaiming, “Let him
cool my tongue,” it would look very much as if our tongue, even while we
are in the flesh, itself possessed material hands, because it is
written, “Death and life are in the *hands* of the tongue.” <span
id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) I suppose it is even to yourself
self-evident, that sin is neither a creature nor a bodily substance;
why, then, has it a face? For do you not hear the psalmist say, “There
is no peace in my bones, in the *face* of my sins”? <span
