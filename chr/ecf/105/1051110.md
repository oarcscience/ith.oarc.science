id="xxi.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XII.\]—God’s Goodness and
Righteousness Shown in All.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxx-p2"></span>It is therefore settled that God’s
grace is not given according to the deserts of the recipients, but
according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise and glory of
His own grace; so that he who glorieth may by no means glory in himself,
but in the Lord, who gives to those men to whom He will, because He is
merciful, what if, however, He does not give, He is righteous: and He
does not give to whom He will not, that He may make known the riches of
His glory to the vessels of mercy. <span
id="fr_3617"></span>[3618](#fn_3617) For by giving to some what they do
not deserve, He has certainly willed that His grace should be
gratuitous, and thus genuine grace; by not giving to all, He has shown
what all deserve. Good in His goodness to some, righteous in the
punishment of others; both good in respect of all, because it is good
when that which is due is rendered, and righteous in respect of all,
since that which is not due is given without wrong to any one.
