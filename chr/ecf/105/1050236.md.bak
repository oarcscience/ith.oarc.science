<span id="xi.lxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 60 \[XXXIV.\]—The Will to Believe is
from God.</span>

<span id="xi.lxiii-p2"></span>Let this discussion suffice, if it
satisfactorily meets the question we had to solve. It may be, however,
objected in reply, that we must take heed lest some one should suppose
that the sin would have to be imputed to God which is committed by free
will, if in the passage where it is asked, “What hast thou which thou
didst not receive?” <span id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) the very
will by which we believe is reckoned as a gift of God, because it arises
out of the free will which we received at our creation. Let the
objector, however, attentively observe that this will is to be ascribed
to the divine gift, not merely because it arises from our free will,
which was created naturally with us; but also because God acts upon us
by the incentives of our perceptions, to will and to believe, either
externally by evangelical exhortations, where even the commands of the
law also do something, if they so far admonish a man of his infirmity
that he betakes himself to the grace that justifies by believing; or
internally, where no man has in his own control what shall enter into
his thoughts, although it appertains to his own will to consent or to
dissent. Since God, therefore, in such ways acts upon the reasonable
soul in order that it may believe in Him (and certainly there is no
ability whatever in free will to believe, unless there be persuasion or
summons towards some one in whom to believe), it surely follows that it
is God who both works in man the willing to believe, and in all things
prevents us with His mercy. To yield our consent, indeed, to God’s
summons, or to withhold it, is (as I have said) the function of our own
will. And this not only does not invalidate what is said, “For what hast
thou that thou didst not receive?” <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) but it really confirms it. For the
soul cannot receive and possess these gifts, which are here referred to,
except by yielding its consent. And thus whatever it possesses, and
whatever it receives, is from God; and yet the act of receiving and
having belongs, of course, to the receiver and possessor. Now, should
any man be for constraining us to examine into this profound mystery,
why this person is so per<span id="page_111">p. 111</span> <span
id="xi.lxiii-Page_111"></span>suaded as to yield, and that person is
not, there are only two things occurring to me, which I should like to
advance as my answer: “O the depth of the riches!” <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) and “Is there unrighteousness with
God?” <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) If the man is
displeased with such an answer, he must seek more learned disputants;
but let him beware lest he find presumptuous ones.
