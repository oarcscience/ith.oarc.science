<span id="xviii.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Of the Praise of the Law.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.x-p2"></span>Once more, in the praise of the law,
what advantage is it to them that, in opposition to the Manicheans, they
say the truth when they wish to bring men from that view to this which
they hold falsely against the catholics? For they say, “We confess that
even the old law, according to the apostle, is holy and just and good,
and that this could confer eternal life on those that kept its
commandments, and lived righteously by faith, like the prophets and
patriarchs, and all the saints.” By which words, very craftily
expressed, they praise the law in opposition to grace; for certainly
that law, although just and holy and good, could not confer eternal life
on all those men of God, but the <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="xviii.vi.x-Page_421"></span>faith which is in Christ. For this faith
worketh by love, not according to the letter which killeth, but
according to the Spirit which maketh alive, to which grace of God the
law, as it were a schoolmaster, leads by deterring from transgression,
that so that might be conferred upon man which it could not itself
confer. For to those words of theirs in which they say “that the law was
able to confer eternal life on the prophets and patriarchs, and all
saints who kept its commandments,” the apostle replies, “If
righteousness be by the law, then has Christ died in vain.” <span
id="fr_2792"></span>[2793](#fn_2792) “If the inheritance be by the law,
then is it no more of promise.” <span
id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793) “If they which are of the law be
heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none
effect.” <span id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794) “But that no man is
justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident: for, The just by
faith liveth.” <span id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795) “But the law
is not of faith: but The man that doeth them shall live in them.” <span
id="fr_2796"></span>[2797](#fn_2796) Which testimony, quoted by the
apostle from the law, is understood in respect of temporal life, in
respect of the fear of losing which, men were in the habit of doing the
works of the law, not of faith; because the transgressors of the law
were commanded by the same law to be put to death by the people. Or, if
it must be understood more highly, that “He who doeth these things shall
live in them” was written in reference to eternal life; the power of the
law is so expressed that the weakness of man in himself, itself failing
to do what the law commands, might seek help from the grace of God
rather of faith, seeing that by His mercy even faith itself is bestowed.
Because faith is thus possessed, according as God has given to every one
the measure of faith. <span id="fr_2797"></span>[2798](#fn_2797) For if
men have it not of themselves, but men receive the Spirit of power and
of love and of continence, whence that very same teacher of the Gentiles
says, “For we have not received the spirit of fear, but of power, and of
love, and of continence,” <span id="fr_2798"></span>[2799](#fn_2798)
—assuredly also the Spirit of faith is received, of which he says,
“Having also the same Spirit of faith.” <span
id="fr_2799"></span>[2800](#fn_2799) Truly, then, says the law, “He who
doeth these things shall live in them.” But in order to do these things,
and live in them, there is necessary not law which ordains this, but
faith which obtains this. Which faith, however, that it may deserve to
receive these things, is itself given freely.
