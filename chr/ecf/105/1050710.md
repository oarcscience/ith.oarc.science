id="xvii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—He Asks What the Great
Knowledge is that Victor Imparts.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.ii-p2"></span>Therefore, brother greatly beloved, I
desire to know what you learned of him, in order that, if I have already
possessed the knowledge, I may participate in your joy; but if I happen
to be ignorant, I may be instructed by you. Did you not then understand
that there are two somethings, soul and spirit, according as it is said
in Scripture, “Thou wilt separate my soul from my spirit”? <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396) And that both of them pertain to
man’s nature, so that the whole man consists of spirit, and soul, and
body? Sometimes, however, these two are combined together under the
designation of *soul*; for instance, in the passage, “And man became a
living soul.” <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397) Now, in this
place the *spirit* is implied. Similarly in sundry passages the two are
described under the name of spirit, as when it is written, “And He bowed
His head and gave up the spirit;” <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398) in which passage it is the soul
that must also be understood. And that the two are of one and the same
substance? I suppose that you already knew all this. But if you did not,
then you may as well know that you have not acquired any great
knowledge, the ignorance of which would be attended with much danger.
<span id="page_332">p. 332</span> <span
id="xvii.v.ii-Page_332"></span>And if there must be any more subtle
discussion on such points it would be better to carry on the controversy
with himself, whose wordy qualities we have already discovered. The
questions we might consider are: whether, when mention is made of the
soul, the spirit is also implied in the term in such a way that the two
comprise the soul, the spirit being, as it were, some part of
it,—whether, in fact (as this person seemed to think), under the
designation *soul*, the whole is so designated from only a part; or
else, whether the two together make up the spirit, that which is
properly called soul being a part thereof; whether again, in fact, the
whole is not called from only a part, when the term *spirit* is used in
such a wide sense as to comprehend the soul also, as this man supposes.
These, however, are but subtle distinctions, and ignorance about them
certainly is not attended with any great danger.
