id="xvi.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—The Pelagian Argument to Show
that the Devil Has No Rights in the Fruits of Marriage.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xiv-p2"></span>After these true and catholic
statements, which are, moreover, really contained in the Holy
Scriptures, although they are not adduced by him in a catholic spirit,
with the earnestness of a catholic mind, he loses no time in introducing
to us the heresy of Pelagius and Cœlestius, for which purpose he wrote,
indeed, his previous remarks. Mark carefully the following words: “You
now who say, ‘We do not deny that they, are still, of whatever parents
born, under the devil’s power, unless they be born again in Christ,’
show us what the devil can recognise as his own in the sexes, by reason
of which he can (to use your phrase) rightly claim as his property the
fruit which they produce. Is it the *difference* of the sexes? But this
is inherent in the bodies which God made. Is it their union? But this
union is justified in the privilege of the primeval blessing no less
than institution. For it is the voice of God that says, ‘A man shall
leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they
two shall be one flesh.’ <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223.md) It
is again the voice of God which says, ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and
replenish the earth.’ <span id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224.md) Or is
it, perchance, their *fertility?* But this is the very reason why
matrimony was instituted.”
