<span id="xiii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>(33.) The Fifth Passage. <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) </span>

<span id="xiii.xxxvii-p3"></span>“This,” says he, “is another text of
theirs: ‘Who will boast that he has a pure heart?’” <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) And then he answered this with
several passages, wishing to show that there can be in man a pure heart.
But he omits to inform us how the passage which he reported as quoted
against himself must be taken, so as to prevent Holy Scripture seeming
to be opposed to itself in this text, and in the passages by which he
makes his answer. We for our part indeed tell him, in answer, that the
clause, “Who will boast that he has a pure heart?” is a suitable sequel
to the preceding sentence, “whenever a righteous king sits upon the
throne.” <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) For how great soever
ever a man’s righteousness may be, he ought to reflect and think, lest
there should be found something blameworthy, which has escaped indeed
his own notice, when that righteous King shall sit upon His throne,
whose cognizance no sins can possibly escape, not even those of which it
is said, “Who understandeth his transgressions?” <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) “When, therefore, the righteous
King shall sit upon His throne, . . . who will boast that he has a pure
heart? or who will boldly say that he is pure from sin?” <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) Except perhaps those who wish to
boast of their own righteousness, and not glory in the mercy of the
Judge Himself.
