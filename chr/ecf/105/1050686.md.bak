id="xvii.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Victor’s Dilemma: He Must
Either Say All Infants are Saved, or Else God Slays the Innocent.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xiv-p2"></span>Let him, then, find an answer, if he
can, when the question is asked of him, why it was that the soul,
without any sin whatever, either original or personal, deserved so to be
condemned to undergo the original sin of another as to be unable to be
delivered from it; let him see which he will choose of two alternatives:
Either to say that even the souls of dying infants who depart hence
without the washing of regeneration, and for whom no sacrifice of the
Lord’s body is offered, are absolved from the bond of original
sin—although the apostle teaches that “from one all go into
condemnation,” <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) —all, that is,
of course, to whom grace does not find its way to help, in order that by
One all might escape into redemption. Or else to say that souls which
have no sin, either their own or original, and are in every respect
innocent, simple, and pure, are punished with eternal damnation by the
righteous God when He inserts them Himself into sinful flesh without any
deliverance therefrom.
