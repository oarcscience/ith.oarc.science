<span id="xxi.ii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Why the Father Does Not Teach
All that They May Come to Christ.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xiv-p2"></span>Why, then, does He not teach all that
they may come to Christ, except because all whom He teaches, He teaches
in mercy, while those whom He teaches not, in judgment He teaches not?
Since, “On whom He will He has mercy, and whom He will He
hardeneth.” <span id="fr_3469"></span>[3470](#fn_3469.md) But He has mercy
when He gives good things. He hardens when He recompenses what is
deserved. Or if, as some would prefer to distinguish them, those words
also are his to whom the apostle says, “Thou sayest then unto me,” so
that he may be regarded as having said, “Therefore hath He mercy on whom
He will, and whom He will He hardeneth,” as well as those which
follow,—to wit, “What is it that is still complained of? for who resists
His will?” does the apostle answer, “O man, what thou hast said is
false?” No; but he says, “O man, who art thou that repliest against God?
Doth the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me
thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump?” <span
id="fr_3470"></span>[3471](#fn_3470.md) and what follows, which you very
well know. And yet in a certain sense the Father teaches all men to come
to His Son. For it was not in vain that it was written in the prophets,
“And they shall all be teachable of God.” <span
id="fr_3471"></span>[3472](#fn_3471.md) And when He too had premised this
testimony, He added, “Every man, therefore, who has heard of the Father,
and has learned, cometh to me.” As, therefore, we speak justly when we
say concerning any teacher of literature who is alone in a city, He
teaches literature here to everybody,—not that all men learn, but that
there is none who learns literature there who does not learn from
him,—so we justly say, God teaches all men to come to Christ, not
because all come, but because none comes in any other way. And why He
does not teach all men the apostle explained, as far as he judged that
it was to be explained, because, “willing to show His wrath, and to
exhibit His power, He endured with much patience the vessels of wrath
which were perfected for destruction; and that He might make known the
riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He has prepared for
glory.” <span id="fr_3472"></span>[3473](#fn_3472.md) Hence it is that the
“word of the cross is foolishness to them that perish; but unto them
that are saved it is the power of God.” <span
id="fr_3473"></span>[3474](#fn_3473.md) God teaches all such to come to
Christ, for He wills all such to be saved, and to come to the knowledge
of the truth. And if He had willed to teach even those to whom the word
of the cross is foolishness to come to Christ, beyond all doubt these
also would have come. For He neither deceives nor is deceived when He
says, “Everyone that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh
to me.” Away, then, with the thought that any one cometh not, who has
heard of the Father and has learned.
