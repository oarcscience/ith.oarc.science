<span id="xix.iv.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41 \[XX.\]—The Wills of Men are So
Much in the Power of God, that He Can Turn Them Whithersoever It Pleases
Him.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xli-p2"></span>I think I have now discussed the point
fully enough in opposition to those who vehemently oppose the grace of
God, by which, however, the human will is not taken away, but changed
from bad to good, and assisted when it is good. I think, too, that I
have so discussed the subject, that it is not so much I myself as the
inspired Scripture which has spoken to you, in the clearest testimonies
of truth; and if this divine record be looked into carefully, it shows
us that not only men’s good wills, which God Himself converts from bad
ones, and, when converted by Him, directs to good actions and to eternal
life, but also those which follow the world are so entirely at the
disposal of God, that He turns them whithersoever He wills, and
whensoever He wills,—to bestow kindness on some, and to heap punishment
on others, as He Himself judges right by a counsel most secret to
Himself, indeed, but beyond all doubt most righteous. For we find that
some sins are even the punishment of other sins, as are those “vessels
of wrath” which the apostle describes as “fitted to destruction;” <span
id="fr_3189"></span>[3190](#fn_3189.md) as is also that hardening of
Pharaoh, the purpose of which is said to be to set forth in him the
power of God; <span id="fr_3190"></span>[3191](#fn_3190.md) as, again, is
the flight of the Israelites from the face of the enemy before the city
of Ai, for fear arose in their heart so that they fled, and this was
done that their sin might be punished in the way it was right that it
should be; by reason of which the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun,
“The children of Israel shall not be able to stand before the face of
their enemies.” <span id="fr_3191"></span>[3192](#fn_3191.md) What is the
meaning of, “They shall not be able to stand”? Now, why did they not
stand by free will, but, with a will perplexed by fear, took to flight,
were it not that God has the lordship even over men’s wills, and when He
is angry turns to fear whomsoever He pleases? Was it not of their own
will that the enemies of the children of Israel fought against the
people of God, as led by Joshua, the son of Nun? And yet the Scripture
says, “It was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come
against Israel in battle, that they might be exterminated.” <span
id="fr_3192"></span>[3193](#fn_3192.md) And was it not likewise of his own
will that the wicked son of Gera cursed King David? And yet what says
David, full of true, and deep, and pious wisdom? What did he say to him
who wanted to smite the reviler? “What,” said he, “have I to do with
you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Let him alone and let him curse, because the
Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who, then, shall say, Wherefore
hast thou done so?” <span id="fr_3193"></span>[3194](#fn_3193.md) And then
the inspired Scripture, as if it would confirm the king’s profound
utterance by repeating it once more, tells us: “And David said to
Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth from
my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more may this Benjamite do it! Let
him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden him. It may be
that the Lord will look on my humiliation, and will requite me good for
his cursing this day.”  <span id="fr_3194"></span>[3195](#fn_3194.md) Now
what prudent reader will fail to understand in what way the Lord bade
this profane man to curse David? It was not by a command that He bade
him, in which case his obedience would be praiseworthy; but He inclined
the man’s will, which had become debased by his own perverseness, to
commit this sin, by His own just and secret judgment. Therefore it is
said, “The Lord said unto him.” Now if this person had obeyed a command
of God, he would have deserved to be praised rather than punished, as we
know he was afterwards punished for this sin. Nor is the reason an
obscure one why the Lord told him after this manner to curse David. “It
may be,” said the humbled king, “that the Lord will look on my
humiliation, and will requite me good for his cursing this day.” See,
then, what proof we have here that God uses the hearts of even wicked
men for the praise and assistance of the good. Thus did He make use of
Judas when betraying Christ; thus did He make use of the Jews when they
crucified Christ. And how vast the blessings which from these instances
He has bestowed upon the nations that should believe in Him! He also
uses our worst enemy, the devil himself, but in the best way, to
exercise and try the faith and piety of good men,—not <span
id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span id="xix.iv.xli-Page_462"></span>for
Himself indeed, who knows all things before they come to pass, but for
our sakes, for whom it was necessary that such a discipline should be
gone through with us. Did not Absalom choose by his own will the counsel
which was detrimental to him? And yet the reason of his doing so was
that the Lord had heard his father’s prayer that it might be so.
Wherefore the Scripture says that “the Lord appointed to defeat the good
counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring all evils
upon Absalom.” <span id="fr_3195"></span>[3196](#fn_3195.md) It called
Ahithophel’s counsel “*good*,” because it was for the moment of
advantage to his purpose. It was in favour of the son against his
father, against whom he had rebelled; and it might have crushed him, had
not the Lord defeated the counsel which Ahithophel had given, by acting
on the heart of Absalom so that he rejected this counsel, and chose
another which was not expedient for him.
