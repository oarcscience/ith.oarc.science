<span id="xxi.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Continuation of the
Preceding.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.iv-p2"></span>But why do we not in opposition to this,
rather hear the words, “Who hath first given to Him and it shall be
recompensed to him again? since of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are
all things.” <span id="fr_3422"></span>[3423](#fn_3422) And from whom,
then, is that very beginning of our faith if not from Him? For this is
not excepted when other things are spoken of as of Him; but “of Him, and
through Him, and in Him, are *all* things.” But who can say that he who
has already begun to believe deserves nothing from Him in whom he has
believed? Whence it results that, to him who already deserves, other
things are said to be added by a divine retribution, and thus that God’s
grace is given according to our merits. And this assertion when put
before him, Pelagius himself condemned, that he might not be condemned.
Whoever, then, wishes on every side to avoid this condemnable opinion,
let him understand that what the apostle says is said with entire
truthfulness, “Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to
believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.” <span
id="fr_3423"></span>[3424](#fn_3423) He shows that both are the gifts of
God, because he said that both were given. And he does not say, “to
believe on Him more fully and perfectly,” but, “to believe on Him.”
Neither does he say that he himself had obtained mercy to be more
faithful, but “to be faithful,” <span
id="fr_3424"></span>[3425](#fn_3424) because he knew that he had not
first given the beginning of his faith to God, and had its increase
given back to him again by Him; but that he had been made faithful by
God, who also had made him an apostle. For the beginnings of his faith
are recorded, and they are very well known by being read in the church
on an occasion calculated to distinguish them: <span
id="fr_3425"></span>[3426](#fn_3425) how, being turned away from the
faith which he was destroying, and being vehemently opposed to it, he
was suddenly by a more powerful grace converted to it, by the conversion
of Him, to whom as One who would do this very thing it was said by the
prophet, “Thou wilt turn and quicken us;” <span
id="fr_3426"></span>[3427](#fn_3426) so that not only from one who
refused to believe he was made a willing believer, but, moreover, from
being a persecutor, he suffered persecution in defence of that faith
which he persecuted. Because it was given him by Christ “not only to
believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.”
