<span id="xvii.iv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[XIV.\]—He Shows that the
Passages of Scripture Adduced by Victor Do Not Prove that Souls are Made
by God in Such a Way as Not to Be Derived by Propagation: First
Passage.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xvii-p2"></span>Here, perhaps, he may say that his
opinion is backed by divine authority, since he supposes that he proves
by passages of the Holy Scriptures that souls are not made by God by way
of propagation, but that they are by distinct acts of creation breathed
afresh into each individual. Let him prove this if he can, and I will
allow that I have learnt from him what I was trying to find out with
great earnestness. But he must go in quest of other defences, which,
perhaps, he will not find, for he has not proved his point by the
passages which he has thus far advanced. For all he has applied to the
subject are to some extent undoubtedly suitable, but they afford only
doubtful demonstration to the point which he raises respecting the
soul’s origin. For it is certain that God has given to man breath and
spirit, as the prophet testifies: “Thus saith the Lord, who made the
heaven, and founded the earth, and all that is therein; who giveth
breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk over
it.” <span id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352) This passage he wishes
to be taken in his own sense, which he is defending; so that the words,
“who giveth breath to the people,” may be understood as implying that He
creates souls for people not by propagation, but by insufflation of new
souls in every case. Let him, then, boldly maintain at this rate that He
does not give us flesh, on the ground that our flesh derives its
original from our parents. In the instance, too, which the apostle
adduces, “God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him,” <span
id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353) let him deny, if he dares, that
corn springs from corn, and grass from grass, from the seed, each after
its kind. And if he dares not deny this, how does he know in what sense
it is said, “He giveth breath to the people”?—whether by derivation from
parents, or by fresh breathing into each individual?
