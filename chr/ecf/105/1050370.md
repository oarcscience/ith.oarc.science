<span id="xiii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—(34.) The Opposing
Passages.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxxviii-p2"></span>And yet the passages are true which he
goes on to adduce by way of answer, saying: “The Saviour in the gospel
declares, ‘Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.’ <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) David also says, ‘Who shall ascend
into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that
is innocent in his hands, and pure in his heart;’ <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) and again in another passage, ‘Do
good, O Lord, unto those that be good and upright in heart.’ <span
id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) So also in Solomon: ‘Riches are
good unto him that hath no sin on his conscience;’ <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) and again in the same book, ‘Leave
off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from
wickedness.’ <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md) So in the
Epistle of John, ‘If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
toward God; and whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him.’” <span
id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md) For all this is accomplished by the
will, by the exercise of faith, hope, and love; by keeping under the
body; by doing alms; by forgiving injuries; by earnest prayer; by
supplicating for strength to advance in our course; by sincerely saying,
“Forgive us, as we also forgive others,” and “Lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil.” <span
id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md) By this process, it is certainly
brought about that our heart is cleansed, and all our sin taken away;
and what the righteous King, when sitting on His throne, shall find
concealed in the heart and uncleansed as yet, shall be remitted by His
mercy, so that the whole shall be rendered sound and cleansed for seeing
God. For “he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no
mercy: yet mercy triumpheth against judgment.” <span
id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528.md) If it were not so, what hope could
any of us have? “When, indeed, the righteous King shall sit upon His
throne, who shall boast that he hath a pure heart, or who shall boldly
say that he is pure from sin?” Then, however, through His mercy shall
the righteous, being by that time fully and perfectly cleansed, <span

id="xiii.xxxviii-Page_172"></span>shine forth like the glorious sun in
the kingdom of their Father. <span id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md)
