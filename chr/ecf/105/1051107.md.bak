<span id="xxi.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25 \[XI.\]—God’s Ways, Both in
Mercy and Judgment, Past Finding Out.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxvii-p2"></span>Accordingly, as says the apostle, “It
is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy,” <span id="fr_3608"></span>[3609](#fn_3608.md) who both
comes to the help of such infants as He will, although they neither will
nor run, since He chose them in Christ before the foundation of the
world as those to whom He intended to give His grace freely,—that is,
with no merits of theirs, either of faith or of works, preceding; and
does not come to the help of those who are more mature, although He
foresaw that they would believe His miracles if they should be done
among them, because He wills not to come to their help, since in His
predestination He, secretly indeed, but yet righteously, has otherwise
determined concerning them. For “there is no unrighteousness with
God;” <span id="fr_3609"></span>[3610](#fn_3609.md) but “His judgments are
unsearchable, and His ways are past finding out; all the ways of the
Lord are mercy and truth.” <span id="fr_3610"></span>[3611](#fn_3610.md)
<span id="page_535">p. 535</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.xxvii-Page_535"></span>Therefore the mercy is past finding
out by which He has mercy on whom He will, no merits of his own
preceding; and the truth is unsearchable by which He hardeneth whom He
will, even although his merits may have preceded, but merits for the
most part common to him with the man on whom He has mercy. As of two
twins, of which one is taken and the other left, the end is unequal,
while the deserts are common, yet in these the one is in such wise
delivered by God’s great goodness, that the other is condemned by no
injustice of God’s. For is there unrighteousness with God? Away with the
thought! but His ways are past finding out. Therefore let us believe in
His mercy in the case of those who are delivered, and in His truth in
the case of those who are punished, without any hesitation; and let us
not endeavour to look into that which is inscrutable, nor to trace that
which cannot be found out. Because out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings He perfects His praise, <span
id="fr_3611"></span>[3612](#fn_3611.md) so that what we see in those whose
deliverance is preceded by no good deservings of theirs, and in those
whose condemnation is only preceded by original sin, common alike to
both,—this we by no means shrink from as occurring in the case of
grown-up people, that is, because we do not think either that grace is
given to any one according to his own merits, or that any one is
punished except for his own merits, whether they are alike who are
delivered and who are punished, or have unequal degrees of evil; so that
he who thinketh he standeth may take heed lest he fall, and he who
glorieth may glory not in himself, but in the Lord.
