<span id="xix.iv.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—The Occasion and Argument of
This Work.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xix.iv.i-p2.1"></span>With</span> reference to those persons who so
preach and defend man’s free will, as boldly to deny, and endeavour to
do away with, the grace of God which calls us to Him, and delivers us
from our evil deserts, and by which we obtain the good deserts which
lead to everlasting life: we have already said a good deal in
discussion, and committed it to writing, so far as the Lord has
vouchsafed to enable us. But since there are some persons who so defend
God’s grace as to deny man’s free will, or who <span id="page_444">p.
444</span> <span id="xix.iv.i-Page_444"></span>suppose that free will is
denied when grace is defended, I have determined to write somewhat on
this point to your Love, <span id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949) my
brother Valentinus, and the rest of you, who are serving God together
under the impulse of a mutual love. For it has been told me concerning
you, brethren, by some members of your brotherhood who have visited us,
and are the bearers of this communication of ours to you, that there are
dissensions among you on this subject. This, then, being the case,
dearly beloved, that you be not disturbed by the obscurity of this
question, I counsel you first to thank God for such things as you
understand; but as for all which is beyond the reach of your mind, pray
for understanding from the Lord, observing, at the same time peace and
love among yourselves; and until He Himself lead you to perceive what at
present is beyond your comprehension, walk firmly on the ground of which
you are sure. This is the advice of the Apostle Paul, who, after saying
that he was not yet perfect, <span id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950)
a little later adds, “Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus
minded,” <span id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951) —meaning perfect to
a certain extent, but not having attained to a perfection sufficient for
us; and then immediately adds, “And if, in any thing, ye be otherwise
minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless, whereunto we
have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.” <span
id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952) For by walking in what we have
attained, we shall be able to advance to what we have not yet
attained,—God revealing it to us if in anything we are otherwise
minded,—provided we do not give up what He has already revealed.
