id="xviii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Not Death Alone, But Sin Also
Has Passed into Us by Means of Adam.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.vi-p2"></span>In that particular, indeed, wherein
they say “that death passed to us by Adam, not sins,” they have not the
Manicheans as their adversaries: since they, too, deny that original sin
from the first man, at first of pure and upright body and spirit, and
afterwards depraved by free will, subsequently passed and passes as sin
into all with death; but they say that the flesh was evil from the
beginning, and was created by an evil spirit and along with an evil
spirit; but that a good soul—a portion, to wit, of God—for the deserts
of its defilement by food and drink, in which it was before bound up,
came into man, and thus by means of copulation was bound in the chain of
the flesh. And thus the Manicheans agree with the Pelagians that it was
not the guilt of the first man that passed into the human race—neither
by the flesh, which they say was never good; nor by the soul, which they
assert comes into the flesh of man with the merits of its own
defilements with which it was polluted before the flesh. But how do the
Pelagians say “that only death passed upon us by Adam’s means”? For if
we die because he died, but he died because be sinned, they say that the
punishment passed without the guilt, and that innocent infants are
punished with an unjust penalty by deriving death without the deserts of
death. This, the catholic faith has known of the one and only mediator
between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who condescended to undergo
death—that is, the penalty of sin—without sin, for us. As He alone
became the Son of man, in order that we might become through Him sons of
God, so He alone, on our behalf, undertook punishment without ill
deservings, that we through Him might obtain grace without good
deservings. Because as to us nothing good was due so to Him nothing bad
was due. Therefore, commending His love to them to whom He was about to
give undeserved life, He was willing to suffer for them an undeserved
death. This special prerogative of the Mediator the Pelagians endeavour
to make void, so that this should no longer be special in the Lord, if
Adam in such wise suffered a death due to him on account of his guilt,
as that infants, drawing from him no guilt, should suffer undeserved
death. For although very much good is conferred on the good by means of
death, whence some have fitly argued even “of the benefit of death;” yet
from this what can be declared except the mercy of God, since the
punishment of sin is converted into beneficent uses?
