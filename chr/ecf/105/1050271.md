<span id="xii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24 \[XXII.\]—Sin and the Penalty of
Sin the Same.</span>

<span id="xii.xxviii-p2"></span>“The very matter,” says he, “of sin is
its punishment, if the sinner is so much weakened that he commits more
sins.” He does not consider how justly the light of truth forsakes the
man who transgresses the law. When thus deserted he of course becomes
blinded, and necessarily offends more; and by so falling is embarrassed
and being embarrassed fails to rise, so as to hear the voice of the law,
which admonishes him to beg for the Saviour’s grace. Is no punishment
due to them of whom the apostle says: “Because that, when they knew God,
they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in
their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened?” <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183) This darkening was, of course,
already their punishment and penalty; and yet by this very penalty—that
is, by their blindness of heart, which supervenes on the withdrawal of
the light of wisdom—they fell into more grievous sins still. “For giving
themselves out as wise, they became fools.” This is a grievous penalty,
if one only understands it; and from such a penalty only see to what
lengths they ran: “And they changed,” he says, “the glory of the
uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.” <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184) All this they did owing to that
penalty of their sin, whereby “their foolish heart was darkened.” And
yet, owing to these deeds of theirs, which, although coming in the way
of punishment, were none the less sins (he goes on to say): “Wherefore
God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own
hearts.” <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185) See how severely God
condemned them, giving them over to uncleanness in the very desires of
their heart. Observe also the sins they commit owing to such
condemnation: “To dishonour,” says he, “their own bodies among
themselves.” <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186) Here is the
punishment of iniquity, which is itself iniquity; a fact which sets
forth in a clearer light the words which follow: “Who changed the truth
of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the
Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.” “For this cause,” says he, “God
gave them up unto vile affections.” <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187) See how often God inflicts
punishment; and out of the self-same punishment sins, more numerous and
more severe, arise. “For even their women did change the natural use
into that which is against nature; and likewise the men also, leaving
the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another;
men with men working that which is unseemly.” <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188) Then, to show that these things
were so sins themselves, that they were also the penalties of sins, he
further says: “And receiving in themselves that recompense of their
error which was meet.” <span id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189)
Observe how often it happens that the very punishment which God inflicts
begets other sins as its natural offspring. Attend still further: “And
even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,” says he,
“God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are
not convenient; being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate,
deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, odious to God, despiteful,
proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection,
implacable, unmerciful.” <span id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190)
Here, now, let our opponent say: “Sin ought not so to have been
punished, that the sinner, through his punishment, should commit even
more sins.”
