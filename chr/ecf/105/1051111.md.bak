id="xxi.iii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—God’s True Grace Could Be
Defended Even If There Were No Original Sin, as Pelagius
Maintains.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxxi-p2"></span>But God’s grace, that is, true grace
without merits, is maintained, even if infants, when baptized, according
to the view of the Pelagians, are not plucked out of the power of
darkness, because they are held guilty of no sin, as the Pelagians
think, but are only transferred into the Lord’s kingdom: for even thus,
without any good merits, the kingdom is given to those to whom it is
given; and without any evil merits it is not given to them to whom it is
not given. And this we are in the habit of saying in opposition to the
same Pelagians, when they object to us that we attribute God’s grace to
fate, when we say that it is given not in respect to our merits. For
they themselves rather attribute God’s grace to fate in the case of
infants, if they say that when there is no merit it is fate. <span
id="fr_3618"></span>[3619](#fn_3618.md) Certainly, even according to the
Pelagians themselves, no merits can be found in infants to cause that
some of them should be admitted into the kingdom, and others should be
alienated from the kingdom. But now, just as in order to show that God’s
grace is not given according to our merits, I preferred to maintain this
truth in accordance with both opinions,—both in accordance with our own,
to wit, who say that infants are bound by original sin, and according to
that of the Pelagians, who deny that there is original sin, and yet I
cannot on that account doubt that infants have what He can pardon them
who saves His people from their sins: so in the third book on Free Will,
according to both views, I have withstood the Manicheans, whether
ignorance and difficulty be punishments or elements of nature without
which no man is born; and yet I hold one of these views. There,
moreover, it is sufficiently evidently declared by me, that that is not
the nature of man as he was ordained, but his punishment as condemned.
