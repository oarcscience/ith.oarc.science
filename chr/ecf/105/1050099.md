<span id="x.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[VIII.\]—Perfection, When to Be
Realized.</span>

<span id="x.iv.x-p2"></span>Our full adoption, then, as children, is to
happen at the redemption of our body. It is therefore the first-fruits
of the Spirit which we now possess, whence we are already really become
the children of God; for the rest, indeed, as it is by hope that we are
saved and renewed, so are we the children of God. But inasmuch as we are
not yet actually saved, we are also not yet fully renewed, nor yet also
fully sons of God, but children of the world. We are therefore advancing
in renewal and holiness of life,—and it is by this that we are children
of God, and by this also we cannot commit sin;—until at last the whole
of that by which we are kept as yet children of this world is changed
into this;—for it is owing to this that we are as yet able to sin. Hence
it comes to pass that “whosoever is born of God doth not commit
sin;” <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496) and as well, “if we were
to say that we have no sin, we should deceive ourselves, and the truth
would not be in us.” <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497) There shall
be then an end put to that within us which keeps us children of the
flesh and of the world; whilst that other shall be perfected which makes
us the children of God, and renews us by His Spirit. Accordingly the
same John says, “Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not
yet appear what we shall be.” <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498)
Now what means this variety in the expressions, “*we are*,” and “*we
shall be*,” but this —*we are* in hope, *we shall be* in reality? For he
goes on to say, “We know that when He shall appear, we shall be like
Him, for we shall see Him as He is.” <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) We have therefore even now begun to be
like Him, having the first-fruits of the Spirit; but yet we are still
unlike Him, by reason of the remainders of the old nature. In as far,
then, as we are like Him, in so far are we, by the regenerating Spirit,
sons of God; but in as far as we are unlike Him, in so far are we the
children of the flesh and of the world. On the one side, we cannot
commit sin; but, on the other, if we say that we have no sin, we only
deceive ourselves,—until we pass entirely into the adoption, and the
sinner be no more, and you look for his place and find it not. <span
