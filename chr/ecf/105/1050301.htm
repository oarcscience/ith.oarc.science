<p><a name="xii.lviii-p2"></A>Now how does all this apply to our subject? Let us see what he makes out of it. &#8220;Whatever,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is fettered by natural necessity is deprived of determination of will and deliberation.&#8221; Well, now, here lies a question; for it is the height of absurdity for us to say that it does not belong to our will that we wish to be happy, on the ground that it is absolutely impossible for us to be unwilling to be happy, by reason of some indescribable but amiable coercion of our nature; nor dare we maintain that God has not the will but the necessity of righteousness, because He cannot will to sin.</p>
