id="xxi.ii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—We Were Elected and
Predestinated, Not Because We Were Going to Be Holy, But in Order that
We Might Be So.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxvii-p2"></span>It would be too tedious to argue
about the several points. But you see without doubt, you see with what
evidence of apostolic declaration this grace is defended, in opposition
to which human merits are set up, as if man should first give something
for it to be recompensed to him again. Therefore God chose us in Christ
before the foundation of the world, predestinating us to the adoption of
children, not because we were going to be of ourselves holy and
immaculate, but He chose and predestinated us that we might be so.
Moreover, He did this according to the good pleasure of His will, so
that nobody might glory concerning his own will, but about God’s will
towards himself. He did this according to the riches of His grace,
according to His good-will, which He purposed in His beloved Son; in
whom we have obtained a share, being predestinated according to the
purpose, not ours, but His, who worketh all things to such an extent as
that He worketh in us to will also. Moreover, He worketh according to
the counsel of His will, that we may be to the praise of His
glory. <span id="fr_3530"></span>[3531](#fn_3530.md) For this reason it is
that we cry that no one should glory in man, and, thus, not in himself;
but whoever glorieth let him glory in the Lord, that he may be for the
praise of His glory. Because He Himself worketh according to His purpose
that we may be to the praise of His glory, and, of course, holy and
immaculate, for which purpose He called us, predestinating us before the
foundation of the world. Out of this, His purpose, is that special
calling of the elect for whom He co-worketh with all things for good,
because they are called according to His purpose, and “the gifts and
calling of God are without repentance.” <span
