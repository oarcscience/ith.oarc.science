<span id="xviii.v-p2"></span>Augustin goes on to refute other matters
which are calumniously objected by the Pelagians in the same letter sent
to Thessalonica; and expounds, in opposition to their heresy, what those
who are truly Catholic say concerning the utility of the law; what they
teach of the effect and virtue of baptism; what of the discrepancy
between the two Testaments, the Old and the New; what concerning the
righteousness and perfection of the prophets and apostles; what of the
appellation of sin in Christ, when He is said in the likeness of sinful
flesh concerning sin to have condemned sin, or to have become sin; and
finally, what they profess concerning the fulfilment of the commandments
in the future life.
