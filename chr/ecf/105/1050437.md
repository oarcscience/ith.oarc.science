id="xiv.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52 \[XXVII. And XXVIII.\]—The Text of
the Letter.</span>

<span id="xiv.lvi-p2"></span>“To my most beloved lord, and most
longed-for brother Pelagius, Augustin sends greeting in the Lord. I
thank you very much for the pleasure you have kindly afforded me by your
letter, and for informing me of your good health. May the Lord requite
you with blessings, and may you ever enjoy them, and live with Him for
evermore in all eternity, my most beloved lord, and most longed-for
brother. For my own part, indeed, although I do not admit your high
encomiums of me, which the letter of your Benignity <span
id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751.md) conveys, I yet cannot be insensible
of the benevolent view you entertain towards my poor deserts; at the
same time requesting you to pray for me, that the Lord would make me
such a man as you suppose me to be already.” Then, in another hand, it
follows: “Be mindful of us; may you be safe, and find favour with the
Lord, my most beloved lord, and most longed-for brother.”

<span id="xiv.lvi-p3"></span> *Tuæ Benignitatis Epistola* is more than
“your kind letter.” “*Benignitas*” is a complimentary abstract title
addressed to the correspondent.
