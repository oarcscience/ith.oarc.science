<span id="xvi.vi.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50.—The Rise and Origin of Evil. The
Exorcism and Exsufflation of Infants, a Primitive Christian Rite.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.li-p2"></span>As to the passage, which he seemed to
himself to indite in a pious vein, as it were, “If nature is of God,
there cannot be original sin in it,” would not another person seem even
to him to give a still more pious turn to it, thus: “If nature is of
God, there cannot arise any sin in it?” And yet this is not true. The
Manicheans, indeed, meant to assert this, and they endeavoured to steep
in all sorts of evil the very nature of God itself, and not His
creature, made out of nothing. For evil arose in nothing else than what
was good—not, however, the supreme and unchangeable good which is God’s
nature, but that which was made out of nothing by the wisdom of God.
This, then, is the reason why man is claimed for a divine work; for he
would not be man unless he were made by the operation of God. But evil
would not exist in infants, if evil had not been committed by the
wilfulness of the first man, and original sin derived from a nature thus
corrupted. It is not true, then, as he puts it, “He is completely a
Manichean who maintains original sin;” but rather, he is completely a
Pelagian who does not believe in original sin. For it is not simply from
the time when the pestilent opinions of Manichæus began to grow that in
the Church of God infants about to be baptized were for the first time
exorcised with exsufflation,—which ceremonial was intended to show that
they were not removed into the kingdom of Christ without first being
delivered from the power of darkness; <span
id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301) nor is it in the books of Manichæus
that we read how “the Son of man come to seek and to save that which was
lost,” <span id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302) or how “by one man sin
entered into the world,” <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303) with
those other similar passages which we have quoted above; or how God
“visits the sins of the fathers upon the children;” <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304) or how it is written in the Psalm,
“I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;” <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305) or again, how “man was made like
unto vanity: his days pass away like a shadow;” <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306) or again, “behold, Thou hast made
my days old, and my existence as nothing before Thee; nay, every man
living is altogether vanity;” <span id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307)
or how the apostle says, “every creature was made subject to
vanity;” <span id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308) or how it is written
in the book of Ecclesiastes, “vanity of vanities; all is vanity: what
profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
sun?” <span id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309) and in the book of
Ecclesiasticus, “a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam from the day that
they go out of their mother’s womb to the day that they return to the
mother of all things;” <span id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310) or how
again the apostle writes, “in Adam all die;” <span
id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311) or how holy Job says, when speaking
about his own sins, “for man that is born of a woman is short-lived and
full of wrath: as <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.li-Page_304"></span>the flower of grass, so does he fall; and
he departs like a shadow, nor shall he stay. Hast Thou not taken account
even of him, and caused him to enter into judgment in Thy sight? For who
shall be pure from uncleanness? Not even one, even if his life should be
but of one day upon the earth.” <span
id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312) Now when he speaks of *uncleanness*
here, the mere perusal of the passage is enough to show that he meant
*sin* to be understood. It is plain from the words, of what he is
speaking. The same phrase and sense occur in the prophet Zechariah, in
the place where “the filthy garments” are removed from off the high
priest, and it is said to him, “I have taken away thy sins.” <span
id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313) Well now, I rather think that all
these passages, and others of like import, which point to the fact that
man is born in sin and under the curse, are not to be read among the
dark recesses of the Manicheans, but in the sunshine of catholic truth.
