<span id="xxi.ii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8 \[IV.\]—What Augustin Wrote to
Simplicianus, the Successor of Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.viii-p2"></span>You see plainly what was at that time
my opinion concerning faith and works, although I was labouring in
commending God’s grace; and in this opinion I see that those brethren of
ours now are, because they have not been as careful to make progress
with me in my writings as they were in reading them. For if they had
been so careful, they would have found that question solved in
accordance with the truth of the divine Scriptures in the first book of
the two which I wrote in the very beginning of my episcopate to
Simplicianus, of blessed memory, Bishop of the Church of Milan, and
successor to St. Ambrose. Unless, perchance, they may not have known
these books; in which case, take care that they do know them. Of this
first of those two books, I first spoke in the second book of the
*Retractations*; and what I said is as follows: “Of the books, I say, on
which, as a bishop, I have laboured, the first two are addressed to
Simplicianus, president of the Church of Milan, who succeeded the most
blessed Ambrose, concerning divers questions, two of which I gathered
into the first book from the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans.
The former of them is about what is written: ‘What shall we say, then?
Is the law sin? By no means;’ <span id="fr_3440"></span>[3441](#fn_3440)
as far as the passage where he says, ‘Who shall deliver me from the body
of this death? The <span id="page_502">p. 502</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.viii-Page_502"></span>grace of God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.’ <span id="fr_3441"></span>[3442](#fn_3441) And therein I have
expounded those words of the apostle: ‘The law is spiritual; but I am
carnal,’ <span id="fr_3442"></span>[3443](#fn_3442) and others in which
the flesh is declared to be in conflict against the Spirit in such a way
as if a man were there described as still under law, and not yet
established under grace. For, long afterwards, I perceived that those
words might even be (and probably were) the utterance of a spiritual
man. The latter question in this book is gathered from that passage
where the apostle says, ‘And not only this, but when Rebecca also had
conceived by one act of intercourse, even by our father Isaac,’ <span
id="fr_3443"></span>[3444](#fn_3443) as far as that place where he says,
‘Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we should be as Sodoma,
and should have been like unto Gomorrah.’ <span
id="fr_3444"></span>[3445](#fn_3444) In the solution of this question I
laboured indeed on behalf of the free choice of the human will, but
God’s grace overcame, and I could only reach that point where the
apostle is perceived to have said with the most evident truth, ‘For who
maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou hast not received?
Now, if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou receivedst
it not?’ <span id="fr_3445"></span>[3446](#fn_3445) And this the martyr
Cyprian was also desirous of setting forth when he compressed the whole
of it in that title: ‘That we must boast in nothing, since nothing is
our own.’” <span id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446) This is why I
previously said that it was chiefly by this apostolic testimony that I
myself had been convinced, when I thought otherwise concerning this
matter; and this God revealed to me as I sought to solve this question
when I was writing, as I said, to the Bishop Simplicianus. This
testimony, therefore, of the apostle, when for the sake of repressing
man’s conceit he said, “For what hast thou which thou hast not
received?” <span id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447) does not allow any
believer to say, I have faith which I received not. All the arrogance of
this answer is absolutely repressed by these apostolic words. Moreover,
it cannot even be said, “Although I have not a perfected faith, yet I
have its beginning, whereby I first of all believed in Christ.” Because
here also is answered: “But what hast thou that thou hast not received?
Now, if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou receivedst
it not?”
