<span id="xii.lxxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 83 \[LXIX.\]—God Enjoins No
Impossibility, Because All Things are Possible and Easy to Love.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxxvii-p2"></span>But “the precepts of the law are very
good,” if we use them lawfully. <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) Indeed, by the very fact (of which
we have the firmest conviction) <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> <span
id="xii.lxxxvii-Page_151"></span>“that the just and good God could not
possibly have enjoined impossibilities,” we are admonished both what to
do in easy paths and what to ask for when they are difficult. Now all
things are easy for love to effect, to which (and which alone) “Christ’s
burden is light,” <span id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) —or rather,
it is itself alone the burden which is light. Accordingly it is said,
“And His commandments are not grievous;” <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md) so that whoever finds them grievous
must regard the inspired statement about their “not being grievous” as
having been capable of only this meaning, that there may be a state of
heart to which they are not burdensome, and he must pray for that
disposition which he at present wants, so as to be able to fulfil all
that is commanded him. And this is the purport of what is said to Israel
in Deuteronomy, if understood in a godly, sacred, and spiritual sense,
since the apostle, after quoting the passage, “The word is nigh thee,
even in thy mouth and in thy heart” <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) (*and*, as the verse also has it,
*in thine hands*, <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) for in
man’s heart are his spiritual hands), adds in explanation, “This is the
word of faith which we preach.” <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) No man, therefore, who “returns to
the Lord his God,” as he is there commanded, “with all his heart and
with all his soul,” <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) will find
God’s commandment “grievous.” How, indeed, can it be grievous, when it
is the precept of love? Either, therefore, a man has not love, and then
it is grievous; or he has love, and then it is not grievous. But he
possesses love if he does what is there enjoined on Israel, by returning
to the Lord his God with all his heart and with all his soul. “A new
commandment,” says He, “do I give unto you, that ye love one
another;” <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md) and “He that loveth
his neighbour hath fulfilled the law;” <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353.md) and again, “Love is the fulfilling
of the law.” <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354.md) In accordance
with these sayings is that passage, “Had they trodden good paths, they
would have found, indeed, the ways of righteousness easy.” <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355.md) How then is it written, “Because of
the words of Thy lips, I have kept the paths of difficulty,” <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md) except it be that both statements
are true: These paths are paths of difficulty to fear; but to love they
are easy?
