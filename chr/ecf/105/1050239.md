id="xi.lxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 63.—An Objection.</span>

<span id="xi.lxvi-p2"></span>But inasmuch as it may be said that the
instances which I have been quoting are divine works, whereas to live
righteously is a work that belongs to ourselves, I undertook to show
that even this too is a divine work. This I have done in the present
book, with perhaps a fuller statement than is necessary, although I seem
to myself to have said too little against the opponents of the grace of
God. And I am never so much delighted in my treatment of a subject as
when Scripture comes most copiously to my aid; and when the question to
be discussed requires that “he that glorieth should glory in the
Lord;” <span id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) and that we should in
all things lift up our hearts and give thanks to the Lord our God, from
whom, “as the Father of lights, every good and every perfect gift cometh
down.” <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) Now if a gift is not
God’s gift, because it is wrought by us, or because we act by His gift,
then it is not a work of God that “a mountain should be removed into the
sea,” inasmuch as, according to the Lord’s statement, it is by the faith
of men that this is possible. Moreover, He attributes the deed to their
actual operation: “If ye have faith <span id="page_112">p. 112</span>
<span id="xi.lxvi-Page_112"></span>in yourselves as a grain of
mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, “Be thou removed, and be
thou cast into the sea; and it shall be done, and nothing shall be
impossible *to you*.” <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) Observe
how He said “to you,” not “to Me” or “to the Father;” and yet it is
certain that no man does such a thing without God’s gift and operation.
See how an instance of perfect righteousness is unexampled among men,
and yet is not impossible. For it might be achieved if there were only
applied so much of will as suffices for so great a thing. There would,
however, be so much will, if there were hidden from us none of those
conditions which pertain to righteousness; and at the same time these so
delighted our mind, that whatever hindrance of pleasure or pain might
else occur, this delight in holiness would prevail over every rival
affection. And that this is not realized, is not owing to any intrinsic
impossibility, but to God’s judicial act. For who can be ignorant, that
what he should know is not in man’s power; nor does it follow that what
he has discovered to be a desirable object is actually desired, unless
he also feel a delight in that object, commensurate with its claims on
his affection? For this belongs to health of soul.
