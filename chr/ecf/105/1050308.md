<span id="xii.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 61 \[LIII.\]—Paul Asserts that the
Flesh is Contrary Even in the Baptized.</span>

<span id="xii.lxv-p2"></span>Now let us see whether we anywhere read
about the flesh being contrary in the baptized also. And here, I ask, to
whom did the apostle say, “The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other;
so that ye do not the things that ye would?” <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273) He wrote this, I apprehend, to the
Galatians, to whom he also says, “He therefore that ministereth to you
the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of
the law or by the hearing of faith?” <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274) It appears, therefore, that it is
to Christians that he speaks, to whom, too, God had given His Spirit:
therefore, too, to the baptized. Observe, therefore, that even in
baptized persons the flesh is found to be contrary; so that they have
not that capacity which, our author says, is inseparably implanted in
nature. Where then is the ground for his assertion, “How can it be that
in the case of a baptized person the flesh is contrary to him?” in
whatever sense he understands the flesh? Because in very deed it is not
its nature that is good, but it is the carnal defects of the flesh which
are expressly named in the passage before us. <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275) Yet observe, even in the baptized,
how contrary is the flesh. And in what way contrary? So that, “They do
not the things which they would.” Take notice that the will is present
in a man; but where is that “capacity of nature?” Let us confess that
grace is necessary to us; let us cry out, “O wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from the body of this death?” And let our answer be,
“The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!” <span
