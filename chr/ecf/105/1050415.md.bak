id="xiv.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30 \[XIV.\]—The Tenth Item in the
Accusation. The More Prominent Points of Cœlestius’ Work
Continued.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p2"></span>After this we find objected against
Pelagius some other points of Cœlestius’ teaching,—prominent ones, and
undoubtedly worthy of condemnation; such, indeed, as would certainly
have involved Pelagius in condemnation, if he had not anathematized them
in the synod. Under his third head Cœlestius was alleged to have
written: “That God’s grace and assistance is not given for single
actions, but is imparted in the freedom of the will, or in the law and
in doctrine.” And again: “That God’s grace is given in proportion to our
deserts; because, were He to give it to sinful persons, He would seem to
be unrighteous.” And from these words he inferred that “therefore grace
itself has been placed in my will, according as I have been either
worthy or unworthy of it. For if we do all things by grace, then
whenever we are overcome by sin, it is not *we* who are overcome, but
God’s grace, which wanted by all means to help us, but was not able.”
And once more he says: “If, when we conquer sin, it is by the grace of
God; then it is He who is in fault whenever we are conquered by sin,
because He was either altogether unable or unwilling to keep us safe.”
To these charges Pelagius replied: “Whether these are really the
opinions of Cœlestius or not, is the concern of those who say that they
are. For my own part, indeed, I never entertained such views; on the
contrary, I anathematize every one who does entertain them.” Then the
synod said: “This holy synod accepts you for your condemnation of these
impious words.” Now certainly there can be no mistake, in regard to
these opinions, either as to the clear way in which Pelagius pronounced
on them his anathema, or as to the absolute terms in which the bishops
condemned them. Whether Pelagius or Cœlestius, or both of them, or
neither of them, or other persons with them or in their name, have ever
held or still hold these sentiments,—may be doubtful or obscure; but
nevertheless by this judgment of the bishops it has been declared
plainly enough that they have been condemned, and that Pelagius would
have been condemned along with them, unless he had himself condemned
them too. Now, after this trial, it is certain that whenever we enter on
a controversy touching opinions of this kind, we only discuss an already
condemned heresy.
