<span id="xix.iv-p5"></span>————————————

<span id="xix.iv-p6"></span>In this treatise Augustin teaches us to
beware of maintaining grace by denying free will, or free will by
denying grace; for that it is evident from the testimony of Scripture
that there is in man a free choice of will; and there are also in the
same Scriptures inspired proofs given of that very grace of God without
which we can do nothing good. Afterwards, in opposition to the
Pelagians, he proves that grace is not bestowed according to our merits.
He explains how eternal life, which is rendered to good works, is really
of grace. He then goes on to show that the grace which is given to us
through our Lord Jesus Christ is neither the knowledge of the law, nor
nature, nor simply remission of sins; but that it is grace that makes us
fulfil the law, and causes nature to be liberated from the dominion of
sin. He demolishes that vain subterfuge of the Pelagians, to the effect
that “grace, although it is not bestowed according to the merits of good
works, is yet given according to the merits of the antecedent good-will
of the man who believes and prays.” He incidentally touches the
question, why God commands what He means Himself to give, and whether He
imposes on us any commands which we are unable to perform. He clearly
shows that the love which is indispensable for fulfilling the
commandments is only within us from God Himself. He points out that God
works in men’s hearts to incline their wills whithersoever He willeth,
either to good works according to His mercy, or to evil ones in return
for their deserving; His judgment, indeed, being sometimes manifest,
sometimes hidden, but always righteous. Lastly, he teaches us that a
clear example of the gratuitousness of grace, not given in return for
our deserts, is supplied to us in the case of those infants which are
saved, while others perish though their case is identical with that of
the rest.
