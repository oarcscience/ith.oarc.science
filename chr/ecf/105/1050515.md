Infants, Without Affirming Original Sin.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv-p2"></span>You, of course, see that Cœlestius here
conceded baptism for infants only in such a manner as to be unwilling to
confess that the sin of the first man, which is washed away in the laver
of regeneration, passes over to them, although at the same time he did
not venture to deny this; and on account of this doubt he refused to
condemn those who maintain “That Adam’s sin injured only himself, and
not the human race;” and “that infants at their birth are in the same
condition wherein Adam was before the transgression.”
