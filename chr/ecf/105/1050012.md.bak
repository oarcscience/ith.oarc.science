id="vii-p1.1"></span>Dedication of Volume II. Of the Edinburgh
Edition.</span>

<span id="vii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="vii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span id="vii-p3.1"></span>TO
The Rev. C. T. Wilkinson, M.A.,</span>

<span id="vii-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii-p4.1"></span>Vicar OF ST. Andrews With Pennycross,
Plymouth.</span>

<span id="vii-p5"></span><span class="c16"><span id="vii-p5.1"></span>My
Dear Vicar</span>,—I have great pleasure in associating your name with
my own in this volume. We are officially connected in the sacred
ministry of the Church, and I think I may, not unsuitably, extend our
relations in this little effort to strengthen the defences of the great
doctrine of <span class="c16"><span id="vii-p5.2"></span>Grace</span>
committed to our care and advocacy. Never was this portion of revealed
truth more formidably assailed than at the present day. Rationalism, as
its primary dogma, asserts the perfectibility of our nature, out of its
own resources; and with a versatility and power of argument and
illustration, which gathers help from every quarter in literature and
philosophy, it opposes “the truth as it is in Jesus.” This truth, which
implies, as its cardinal points, the ruin of man’s nature in the sin of
the first Adam, and its recovery in the obedience of the second Adam, is
vindicated with admirable method and convincing force in the
Anti-Pelagian treatises of the great Doctor of the Western Church. Some
of these treatises appear for the first time in our language in this
volume; and you will, I am sure, admire the acuteness with which Saint
Augustin tracks out and refutes the sophistries of the rationalists of
his own day, as well as the profound knowledge and earnest charity with
which he enforces and recommends the Catholic verity.

<span id="vii-p6"></span>In identifying you thus far with myself in this
undertaking, I not only gratify my own feelings of sincere friendship,
but with a confidence which I believe I do not over-estimate, I assume,
what I highly prize, your agreement with me in accepting and furthering
the principles set forth in this volume.

<span id="vii-p7"></span>With sincere sympathy for you in your important
work at Plymouth, and best wishes for the divine blessing upon it,
believe me, yours very faithfully,

<span id="vii-p8"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii-p8.1"></span>Peter Holmes.</span>

<span id="vii-p9"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="vii-p9.1"></span>Mannamead, Plymouth, June 24, 1874</span>.
