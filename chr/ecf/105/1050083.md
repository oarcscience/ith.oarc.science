id="x.iii.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 65 \[XXXV.\]—In Infants There is No
Sin of Their Own Commission.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lxv-p2"></span>Will this also be questioned, and must we
spend time in discussing it, in order to prove and show how that by
their own will—without which there can be no sin in their own
life—infants could never commit an offence, whom all, for this very
reason, are in the habit of calling *innocent?* Does not their great
weakness of mind and body, their great ignorance of things, their utter
inability to obey a precept, the absence in them of all perception and
impression of law, either natural or written, the complete want of
reason to impel them in either direction,—proclaim and demonstrate the
point before us by a silent testimony far more expressive than any
argument of ours? The very palpableness of the fact must surely go a
great way to persuade us of its truth; for there is no place where I do
not find traces of what I say, so ubiquitous is the fact of which we are
speaking,—clearer, indeed, to perceive than any thing we can say to
prove it.
