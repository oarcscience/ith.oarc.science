<span id="x.iii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—From the First Epistle of
Peter.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xli-p2"></span>See with what earnestness the apostles
declare this doctrine, when they received it. Peter, in his first
Epistle, says: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
according to His abundant mercy, who hath regenerated us unto the hope
of eternal life, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, to an inheritance
immortal, and undefiled, flourishing, reserved in heaven for you, who
are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be
revealed in the last time.” <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340) And
a little afterwards he adds: “May ye be found unto the praise and honour
of Jesus Christ: of whom ye were ignorant; but in whom ye believe,
though now ye see Him not; and in whom also ye shall rejoice, when ye
shall see Him, with joy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end
of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.” <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341) Again, in another place he says: “But
ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath
called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.” <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342) Once more he says: “Christ hath once
suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us
to God:” <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343) and, after mentioning
the fact of eight persons having been saved in Noah’s ark, he adds: “And
by the like figure baptism saveth you.” <span
id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344) Now infants are strangers to this
salvation and light, and will remain in perdition and darkness, unless
they are joined to the people of God by adoption, holding to Christ who
suffered the just for the unjust, to bring them unto God.
