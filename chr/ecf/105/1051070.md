<span id="xxi.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34 \[XVII.\]—The Special Calling
of the Elect is Not Because They Have Believed, But in Order that They
May Believe.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxiv-p2"></span>Let us, then, understand the calling
whereby <span id="page_515">p. 515</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.xxxiv-Page_515"></span>they become elected,—not those who are
elected because they have believed, but who are elected that they may
believe. For the Lord Himself also sufficiently explains this calling
when He says, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.” <span
id="fr_3524"></span>[3525](#fn_3524) For if they had been elected
because they had believed, they themselves would certainly have first
chosen Him by believing in Him, so that they should deserve to be
elected. But He takes away this supposition altogether when He says, “Ye
have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.” And yet they themselves,
beyond a doubt, chose Him when they believed on Him. Whence it is not
for any other reason that He says, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you,” than because they did not choose Him that He should choose
them, but He chose them that they might choose Him; because His mercy
preceded them according to grace, not according to debt. Therefore He
chose them out of the world while He was wearing flesh, but as those who
were already chosen in Himself before the foundation of the world. This
is the changeless truth concerning predestination and grace. For what is
it that the apostle says, “As He hath chosen us in Himself before the
foundation of the world”?  <span id="fr_3525"></span>[3526](#fn_3525)
And assuredly, if this were said because God foreknew that they would
believe, not because He Himself would make them believers, the Son is
speaking against such a foreknowledge as that when He says, “Ye have not
chosen me, but I have chosen you;” when God should rather have foreknown
this very thing, that they themselves would have chosen Him, so that
they might deserve to be chosen by Him. Therefore they were elected
before the foundation of the world with that predestination in which God
foreknew what He Himself would do; but they were elected out of the
world with that calling whereby God fulfilled that which He
predestinated. For whom He predestinated, them He also called, with that
calling, to wit, which is according to the purpose. Not others,
therefore, but those whom He predestinated, them He also called; nor
others, but those whom He so called, them He also justified; nor others,
but those whom He predestinated, called, and justified, them He also
glorified; assuredly to that end which has no end. Therefore God elected
believers; but He chose them that they might be so, not because they
were already so. The Apostle James says: “Has not God chosen the poor in
this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath
promised to them that love Him?” <span
id="fr_3526"></span>[3527](#fn_3526) By choosing them, therefore; He
makes them rich in faith, as He makes them heirs of the kingdom; because
He is rightly said to choose that in them, in order to make which in
them He chose them. I ask, who can hear the Lord saying, “Ye have not
chosen me, but I have chosen you,” and can dare to say that men believe
in order to be elected, when they are rather elected to believe; lest
against the judgment of truth they be found to have first chosen Christ
to whom Christ says, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you”? <span id="fr_3527"></span>[3528](#fn_3527)
