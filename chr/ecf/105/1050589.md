id="xvi.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Lust and Shame Come from Sin;
The Law of Sin; The Shamelessness of the Cynics.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxiv-p2"></span>But if, in like manner, the question be
asked of the concupiscence of the flesh, how it is that acts now bring
shame which once were free from shame, will not her answer be, that she
only began to have existence in men’s members after sin? \[XXII.\] And,
therefore, that the apostle designated her influence as “the law of
sin,” <span id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145.md) inasmuch as she
subjugated man to herself when he was unwilling to remain subject to
<span id="page_274">p. 274</span> <span
id="xvi.v.xxiv-Page_274"></span>his God; and that it was she who made
the first married pair ashamed at that moment when they covered their
loins; even as all are still ashamed, and seek out secret retreats for
cohabitation, and dare not have even the children, whom they have
themselves thus begotten, to be witnesses of what they do. It was
against this modesty of natural shame that the Cynic philosophers, in
the error of their astonishing shamelessness, struggled so hard: they
thought that the intercourse indeed of husband and wife, since it was
lawful and honourable, should therefore be done in public. Such
barefaced obscenity deserved to receive the name of dogs; and so they
went by the title of “*Cynics*.” <span
