id="xv.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[XII.\]—Grace Causes Us to
Do.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xiii-p2"></span>To him, therefore, who is reluctant to
endure the troublesome process, whereby this vaunting disposition is
restrained, before he attains to the ultimate and highest perfection of
charity, it is most properly said, “My grace is sufficient for thee; for
my strength is made perfect in weakness,” <span
id="fr_1810"></span>[1811](#fn_1810.md) —in weakness, that is, not of the
flesh only, as this man supposes, but both of the flesh and of the mind;
because the mind, too, was, in comparison of that last stage of complete
perfection, weak, and to it also was assigned, in order to check its
elation, that messenger of Satan, the thorn in the flesh; although it
was very strong, in contrast with the carnal or animal faculties, which
as yet understand not the things of the Spirit of God. <span
id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md) Inasmuch, then, as strength is made
perfect in weakness, whoever does not own himself to be weak, is not in
the way to be perfected. This grace, however, by which strength is
perfected in weakness, conducts all who are predestinated and called
according to the divine purpose <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md) to the state of the highest
perfection and glory. By such grace it is effected, not only that we
discover what ought to be done, but also that we do what we have
discovered,—not only that we believe what ought to be loved, but also
that we love what we have believed.
