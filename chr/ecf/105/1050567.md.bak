<span id="xvi.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2. \[II.\]—Why This Treatise Was
Addressed to Valerius.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.ii-p2"></span>Now there are three very special reasons,
which I will briefly indicate, why I wished to write to you particularly
on this subject. One is, because by the gift of Christ you are a strict
observer of conjugal chastity. Another is, because by your great care
and diligence you have effectually withstood those profane novelties
which we are resisting in our present discussion. The third is, because
of my learning that something which they had committed to writing had
found its way into your hands; and although in your robust faith you
could despise such an attempt, it is still a good thing for us also to
know how to bring aid to our faith by defending it. For the Apostle
Peter instructs us to be “ready always to give an answer to every one
that asketh us a reason of the faith and hope that is in us;” <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md) and the Apostle Paul says, “Let
your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know
how ye ought to answer every man.” <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md) These are the motives which chiefly
impel me to hold such converse with you in this volume, as the Lord
shall enable me. I have never liked, indeed, to intrude the perusal of
any of my humble labours on any eminent person, who is like yourself
conspicuous to all from the elevation of his office, without his own
request,—especially when he is not blessed with the enjoyment of a
dignified retirement, but is still occupied in the public duties of a
soldier’s profession; this has always seemed to me to savour more
impertinence than of respectful esteem. If, then, I have incurred
censure of this kind, while acting on the reasons which I have now
mentioned, I crave the favour of your forgiveness, and kindly regard to
the following arguments.
