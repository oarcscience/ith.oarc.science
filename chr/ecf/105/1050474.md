id="xv.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[XVIII.\]—The Two Roots of
Action, Love and Cupidity; And Each Brings Forth Its Own Fruit.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xix-p2"></span>Concerning this “capacity,” Pelagius
thus writes in the first book of his *Defence of Free Will*: “Now,” says
he, “we have implanted in us by God a capacity for either part. <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825.md) It resembles, as I may say, a
fruitful and fecund root which yields and produces diversely according
to the will of man, and which is capable, at the planter’s own choice,
of either shedding a beautiful bloom of virtues, or of bristling with
the thorny thickets of vices.” Scarcely heeding what he says, he here
makes one and the same root productive both of good and evil fruits, in
opposition to gospel truth and apostolic teaching. For the Lord declares
that “a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit;” <span id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826.md)
and when the Apostle Paul says that covetousness is “the root of all
evils,” <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827.md) he intimates to us,
of course, that love may be regarded as the root of all good things. On
the supposition, therefore, that two trees, one good and the other
corrupt, represent two human beings, a good one and a bad, what else is
the good man except one with a good will, that is, a tree with a good
root? And what is the bad man except one with a bad will, that is, a
tree with a bad root? The fruits which spring from such roots and trees
are deeds, are words, are thoughts, which proceed, when good, from a
good will, and when evil, from an evil one.
