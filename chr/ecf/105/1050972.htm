<p class="c46"><a name="xix.iv.xxxviii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xix.iv.xxxviii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 38.&#8212;We Would Not Love God Unless He First Loved Us. The Apostles Chose Christ Because They Were Chosen; They Were Not Chosen Because They Chose Christ.</span></p>  
<p><a name="xix.iv.xxxviii-p2"></A>Let no one, then, deceive you, my brethren, for we should not love God unless He first loved us. John again gives us the plainest proof of this when he says, &#8220;We love Him because He first loved us.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3167"></A><A HREF="#fn_3167"><FONT SIZE="1">3168</FONT></A>
 Grace makes us lovers of the law; but the law itself, without grace, makes us nothing but breakers of the law. And nothing else than this is shown us by the words of our Lord when He says to His disciples, Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3168"></A><A HREF="#fn_3168"><FONT SIZE="1">3169</FONT></A>
 For if we first loved Him, in order that by this merit He might love us, then we first chose Him that we might deserve to be chosen by Him. He, however, who is the Truth says otherwise, and flatly contradicts this vain conceit of men. &#8220;You have not chosen me,&#8221; <A NAME="page_460"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 460</FONT></A> <a name="xix.iv.xxxviii-Page_460"></A>He says. If, therefore, you have not chosen me, undoubtedly you have not loved me (for how could they choose one whom they did not love?). &#8220;But I,&#8221; says He, &#8220;have chosen you.&#8221; And then could they possibly help choosing Him afterwards, and preferring Him to all the blessings of this world? But it was because they had been chosen, that they chose Him; not because they chose Him that they were chosen. There could be no merit in men&#146;s choice of Christ, if it were not that God&#146;s grace was prevenient in His choosing them. Whence the Apostle Paul pronounces in the Thessalonians this benediction: &#8220;The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3169"></A><A HREF="#fn_3169"><FONT SIZE="1">3170</FONT></A>
 This benediction to love one another He gave us, who had also given us a law that we should love each other. Then, in another passage addressed to the same church, seeing that there now existed in some of its members the disposition which he had wished them to cultivate, he says, &#8220;We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3170"></A><A HREF="#fn_3170"><FONT SIZE="1">3171</FONT></A>
 This he said lest they should make a boast of the great good which they were enjoying from God, as if they had it of their own mere selves. Because, then, your faith has so great a growth (this is the purport of his words), and the love of every one of you all toward each other so greatly abounds, we ought to thank God concerning you, but not to praise you, as if you possessed these gifts of yourselves.</p>
