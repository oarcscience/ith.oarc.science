id="xiv.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56 \[XXXI.\]—Is Pelagius Sincere?</span>

<span id="xiv.lx-p2"></span>How, then, can it be believed that Pelagius
(if indeed this epistle is his) could have been sincere, when he
acknowledged the grace of God, which is not nature with its free will,
nor the knowledge of the law, nor simply the forgiveness of sins, but a
something which is necessary to each of our actions; or could have
sincerely anathematized everybody who entertained the contrary
opinion:—seeing that in his epistle he set forth even the *ease*
wherewith a man can avoid sinning (concerning which no question had
arisen at this trial) just as if the judges had come to an agreement to
receive even this word, and said nothing about the grace of God, by the
confession and subsequent addition of which he escaped the penalty of
condemnation by the Church?
