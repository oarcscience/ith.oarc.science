id="x.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Origin of Errors; A Simile Sought
from the Foreskin of the Circumcised, and from the Chaff of
Wheat.</span>

<span id="x.v.xvi-p2"></span>“But surely,” say they, “if baptism
cleanses the primeval sin, they who are born of two bap<span

parents ought to be free from this sin; for these could not have
transmitted to their children that thing which they did not themselves
possess.” Now observe whence error usually thrives: it is when persons
are able to start subjects which they are not able to understand. For
before what audience, and in what words, can I explain how it is that
sinful mortal beginnings bring no obstacle to those who have inaugurated
other, immortal, beginnings, and at the same time prove an obstacle to
those whom those very persons, against whom it was not an obstacle, have
begotten out of the self-same sinful beginnings? How can a man
understand these things, whose labouring mind is impeded both by its own
prejudiced opinions and by the chain of its own stolid obstinacy? If
indeed I had undertaken my cause in opposition to those who either
altogether forbid the baptism of infants, or else contend that it is
superfluous to baptize them alleging that as they are born of believing
parents, they must needs enjoy the merit of their parents; then it would
have been my duty to have roused myself perhaps to greater labour and
effort for the purpose of refuting their opinion. In that case, if I
encountered a difficulty before obtuse and contentious men in refuting
error and inculcating truth, owing to the obscurity which besets the
nature of the subject, I should probably resort to such illustrations as
were palpable and at hand; and I should in my turn ask them some
questions,—how, for instance, if they were puzzled to know in what way
sin, after being cleansed by baptism, still remained in those who were
begotten of baptized parents, they would explain how it is that the
foreskin, after being removed by circumcision, should still remain in
the sons of the circumcised? or again, how it happens that the chaff
which is winnowed off so carefully by human labour still keeps its place
in the grain which springs from the winnowed wheat?
