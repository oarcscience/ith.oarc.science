<span id="xiv.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XIII.\]—The Ninth Item of the
Accusation; And Pelagius’ Reply.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxiii-p2"></span>The next objections were urged out of
the book of Cœlestius, following the contents of each several chapter,
but rather according to the sense than the words. These indeed he
expatiates on rather fully; they, however, who presented the indictment
against Pelagius said that they had been unable at the moment to adduce
all the words. In the first chapter, then, of Cœlestius’ book they
alleged that the following was written: “That we do more than is
commanded us in the law and the gospel.” To this <span id="page_196">p.
196</span> <span id="xiv.xxxiii-Page_196"></span>Pelagius replied: “This
they have set down as my statement. What we said, however, was in
keeping with the apostle’s assertion concerning virginity, of which Paul
writes: ‘I have no commandment of the Lord.’” <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) Upon this the synod said: “This
also the Church receives.” I have read for myself the meaning which
Cœlestius gives to this in his book,—for he does not deny that the book
is his. Now he made this statement obviously with the view of persuading
us that we possess through the nature of free will so great an ability
for avoiding sin, that we are able to do more than is commanded us; for
a perpetual virginity is maintained by very many persons, and this is
not commanded; whereas, in order to avoid sin, it is sufficient to
fulfil what is commanded. When the judges, however, accepted Pelagius’
answer, they did not take it to convey the idea that those persons keep
all the commandments of the law and the gospel who over and above
maintain the state of virginity, which is not commanded,—but only this,
that virginity, which is not commanded, is something more than conjugal
chastity, which is commanded; so that to observe the one is of course
more than to keep the other; whereas, at the same time, neither can be
maintained without the grace of God, inasmuch as the apostle, in
speaking of this very subject, says: “But I would that all men were even
as I myself. Every man, however, hath his proper gift of God, one after
this manner, and another after that.” <span
id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md) And even the Lord Himself, upon the
disciples remarking, “If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is
not expedient to marry” (or, as it may be better expressed in Latin, “it
is not expedient to take a wife”), <span
id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md) said to them: “All men cannot
receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.” <span
id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md) This, therefore, is the doctrine
which the bishops of the synod declared to be received by the Church,
that the state of virginity, persevered in to the last, which is not
commanded, is more than the chastity of married life, which is
commanded. In what view Pelagius or Cœlestius regarded this subject, the
judges were not aware.

<span id="xiv.xxxiii-p5"></span> This “better expression,” “non expedit
*ducere*,” Augustin substitutes for the reading “non expedit *nubere*,”
as applied to a woman’s taking a husband. The original, <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.xxxiii-p5.1"></span>γαμῆσαι</span> \[not
<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.xxxiii-p5.2"></span>γαμεῖσθαι</span>\], justifies Augustin’s
preference.
