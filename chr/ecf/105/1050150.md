<span id="x.v.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—Pelagius Esteemed a Holy Man;
His Expositions on Saint Paul.</span>

<span id="x.v.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="x.v.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> questions which you proposed that I
should write to you about, in opposition to those persons who say that
Adam would have died even if he had not sinned, and that nothing of his
sin has passed to his posterity by natural transmission; and especially
on the subject of the baptism of infants, which the universal Church,
with most pious and maternal care, maintains in constant celebration;
and whether in this life there are, or have been, or ever will be,
children of men without any sin at all—I have already discussed in two
lengthy books. And I venture to think that if in them I have not met all
the points which perplex all men’s minds on such matters (an achievement
which, I apprehend,—nay, which I have no doubt,—lies beyond the power
either of myself, or of any other person), I have at all events prepared
something in the shape of a firm ground on which those who defend the
faith delivered to us by our fathers, against the novel opinions of its
opponents, may at any time take their stand, not unarmed for the
contest. However, within the last few days I have read some writings by
Pelagius,—a holy man, as I am told, who has made no small progress in
the Christian life,—containing some very brief expository notes on the
epistles of the Apostle Paul; <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md)
and therein I found, on coming to the passage where the apostle says,
“By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so it
passed upon all men,” <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) an
argument which is used by those who say that infants are not burdened
with original sin. Now I confess that I have not refuted this argument
in my lengthy treatise, because it did not indeed once occur to me that
anybody was capable of thinking such sentiments. Being, however,
unwilling to add to that work, which I had concluded, I have thought it
right to insert in this epistle both the argument itself in the very
words in which I read it, and the answer which it seems to me proper to
give to it.
