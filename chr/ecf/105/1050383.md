<span id="xiv.ii-p6"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xiv.ii-p6.1"></span>“About</span> the same time, in the East (that
is to say, in Palestinian Syria), Pelagius was summoned by certain
catholic brethren <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605) before a
tribunal of bishops, and was heard on his trial by fourteen prelates, in
the abscnce of his accusers, who were unable to be present on the day of
the synod. On his condemning the very dogmas which were read from the
indictment against him, as assailing the grace of Christ, they
pronounced him to be a catholic. But when the Acts of this synod found
their way into our hands, I wrote a treatise on them, to prevent the
idea gaining ground that, because he had been in a manner acquitted, his
opinions also were approved by the bishops; or that the accused could by
any chance have escaped condemnation at their hands, unless he had
condemned the opinions charged against him. This treatise of mine begins
with these words: ‘After there came into my hands.’”
