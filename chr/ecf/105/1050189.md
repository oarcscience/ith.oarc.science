<span id="xi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[VIII.\]—Keeping the Law; The Jews’
Glorying; The Fear of Punishment; The Circumcision of the Heart.</span>

<span id="xi.xvi-p2"></span>Then comes what I mentioned above; then he
shows what the Jew is, and says that he is called a Jew, but by no means
fulfils what he promises to do. “But if,” says he, “thou callest thyself
a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, and knowest
His will, and triest the things that are different, being instructed out
of the law; and art confident that thou art thyself a guide of the
blind, a light of them that are in darkness, an instructor of the
foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the
truth in the law. Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not
<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span
id="xi.xvi-Page_88"></span>thyself? thou that preachest a man should not
steal, dost thou steal? thou that sayest a man should not commit
adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost
thou commit sacrilege? thou that makest thy boast of the law, through
breaking the law dishonorest thou God? For the name of God is blasphemed
among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. Circumcision verily
profiteth, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law,
thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. Therefore, if the
uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his
uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? And shall not uncircumcision
which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter
and circumcision dost transgress the law? For he is not a Jew who is one
outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:
but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the
heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men,
but of God.” <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748) Here he plainly
showed in what sense he said, “Thou makest thy boast of God.” For
undoubtedly if one who was truly a Jew made his boast of God in the way
which grace demands (which is bestowed not for merit of works, but
gratuitously), then his praise would be of God, and not of men. But
they, in fact, were making their boast of God, as if they alone had
deserved to receive His law, as the Psalmist said: “He did not the like
to any nation, nor His judgments has He displayed to them.” <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749) And yet, they thought they were
fulfilling the law of God by their righteousness, when they were rather
breakers of it all the while! Accordingly, it “wrought wrath” <span
id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750) upon them, and sin abounded, committed
as it was by them who knew the law. For whoever did even what the law
commanded, without the assistance of the Spirit of grace, acted through
fear of punishment, not from love of righteousness, and hence in the
sight of God that was not in the will, which in the sight of men
appeared in the work; and such doers of the law were held rather guilty
of that which God knew they would have preferred to commit, if only it
had been possible with impunity. He calls, however, “the circumcision of
the heart” the will that is pure from all unlawful desire; which comes
not from the *letter*, inculcating and threatening, but from the
*Spirit*, assisting and healing. Such doers of the law have their praise
therefore, not of men but of God, who by His grace provides the grounds
on which they receive praise, of whom it is said, “My soul shall make
her boast of the Lord;” <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751) and to
whom it is said, “My praise shall be of Thee:” <span
id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752) but those are not such who would have
God praised because they are men; but themselves, because they are
righteous.
