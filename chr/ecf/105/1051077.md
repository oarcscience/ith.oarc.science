<span id="xxi.ii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—Further Apostolic
Testimonies.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xli-p2"></span>And again, the same apostle says to the
same people, in his second Epistle: “When I had come to Troas for the
gospel of Christ, and a door had been opened unto me in the Lord, I had
no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus, my brother: but, making
my farewell to them, I went away into Macedonia.” <span
id="fr_3543"></span>[3544](#fn_3543) To whom did he bid farewell but to
those who had believed,—to wit, in whose hearts the door was opened for
his preaching of the gospel? But attend to what he adds, saying, “Now
thanks be unto God, who always causes us to triumph in Christ, and
maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us in every place:
because we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them who are saved,
and in them who perish: to some, indeed, we are the savour of death unto
death, but to some the savour of life unto life.” <span
id="fr_3544"></span>[3545](#fn_3544) See concerning what this most
zealous soldier and invincible defender of grace gives thanks. See
concerning what he gives thanks,—that the apostles are a sweet savour of
Christ unto God, both in those who are saved by His grace, and in those
who perish by His judgment. But in order that those who little
understand these things may be less enraged, he himself gives a warning
when he adds the words: “And who is sufficient for these things?” <span
id="fr_3545"></span>[3546](#fn_3545) But let us return to the opening of
the door by which the apostle signified the beginning of faith in his
hearers. For what is the meaning of, “Withal praying also for us that
God would open unto us a door of the word,” <span
id="fr_3546"></span>[3547](#fn_3546) unless it is a most manifest
demonstration that even the very beginning of faith is the gift of God?
For it would not be sought for from Him in prayer, unless it were
believed to be given by Him. This gift of heavenly grace had descended
to that seller of purple <span id="fr_3547"></span>[3548](#fn_3547) for
whom, as Scripture says in the Acts of the Apostles, “The Lord opened
her heart, and she gave heed unto the things which were said by Paul;”
for she was so called that she might believe. Because God does what He
will in the hearts of men, either by assistance or by judgment; so that,
even through their means, may be fulfilled what His hand and counsel
have predestinated to be done.
