<span id="xxi.iii.lxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 62.—Prayer to Be Inculcated,
Nevertheless.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lxiv-p2"></span>But I do not think that manner which I
have said should be adopted in the preaching of predestination ought to
be sufficient for him who speaks to the congregation, except he adds
this, or something of this kind, saying, “You, therefore, ought also to
hope for that perseverance in obedience from the Father of Lights, from
whom cometh down every excellent gift and every perfect gift, <span
id="fr_3701"></span>[3702](#fn_3701.md) and to ask for it in your daily
prayers; and in doing this ought to trust that you are not aliens from
the predestination of His people, because it is He Himself who bestows
even the power of doing this. And far be it from you to despair of
yourselves, because you are bidden to have your hope in Him, not in
yourselves. For cursed is every one who has hope in man; <span
id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702.md) and it is good rather to trust in
the Lord than to trust in man, because blessed are all they that put
their trust in Him. <span id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703.md) Holding
this hope, serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice unto Him with
trembling. <span id="fr_3704"></span>[3705](#fn_3704.md) Because no one can
be certain of the life eternal which God who does not lie has promised
to the children of promise before the times of eternity,—no one, unless
that life of his, which is a state of trial upon the earth, is
completed. <span id="fr_3705"></span>[3706](#fn_3705.md) But He will make
us to persevere in Himself unto the end of that life, since we daily say
to Him, ‘Lead us not into temptation.’” <span
id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md) When these things and things of
this kind are said, whether to few Christians or to the multitude of the
Church, why do we fear to preach the predestination of the saints and
the true grace of God,—that is, the grace which is not given according
to our merits,—as the Holy Scripture declares it? Or, indeed, must it be
feared that a man should then despair of himself when his hope is shown
to be placed in God, and should not rather despair of himself if he
should, in his excess of pride and unhappiness, place it in himself?
