<span id="xii.lx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56 \[XLVIII.\]—The Assistance of Grace
in a Perfect Nature.</span>

<span id="xii.lx-p2"></span>Not only, then, are these similes employed
by our author false, but so is the matter which he wishes them to
illustrate. He goes on to say: “In like manner, touching the possibility
of our not sinning, we must understand that it is of us not to sin, but
yet that the ability to avoid sin is not of us.” If he were speaking of
man’s whole and perfect nature, which we do not now possess (“for we are
saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope. But if we hope for
that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it” <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260) .md), his language even in that case
would not be correct to the effect that to avoid sinning would be of us
alone, although to sin would be of us, for even then there must be the
help of God, which must shed itself on those who are willing to receive
it, just as the light is given to strong and healthy eyes to assist them
in their function of sight. Inasmuch, however, as it is about this
present life of ours that he raises the question, wherein our
corruptible body weighs down the soul, and our earthly tabernacle
depresses our sense with all its many thoughts, I am astonished that he
can with any heart suppose that, even without the help of our Saviour’s
healing balm, it is in our own power to avoid sin, and the ability not
to sin is of nature, which gives only stronger evidence of its own
corruption by the very fact of its failing to see its taint.
