Reason of Pelagius’ Hesitation So to Say.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xviii-p2"></span>For, when wishing to point out why
this lies within our own competency, he says: “Because we are able to
turn all these actions into evil.” This, then, was the reason why he was
afraid to admit that such an action proceeds “*both from ourselves and
from God*,” lest it should be objected to him in reply: “If the fact of
our doing, speaking, thinking anything good, is owing both to ourselves
and to God, because He has endowed us with this ability, then it follows
that our doing, thinking, speaking evil things, is due to ourselves and
to God, because He has here also endowed us with ability of
indifferency; the conclusion from this being—and God forbid that we
should admit any such—that just as God is associated with ourselves in
the praise of good actions, so must He share with us the blame of evil
actions.” For that “capacity” with which He has endowed us makes us
capable alike of good actions and of evil ones.
