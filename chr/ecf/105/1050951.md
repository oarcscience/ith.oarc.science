<span id="xix.iv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—The Faith that He Kept Was the
Free Gift of God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xvii-p2"></span>His last clause runs thus: “I have kept
the faith.” But he who says this is the same who declares in another
passage, “I have obtained mercy that I might be faithful.” <span
id="fr_3045"></span>[3046](#fn_3045) He does not say, “I obtained mercy
because I was faithful,” but “in order that I might be faithful,” thus
showing that even faith itself cannot be had without God’s mercy, and
that it is the gift of God. This he very expressly teaches us when he
says, “For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of
yourselves; it is the gift of God.” <span
id="fr_3046"></span>[3047](#fn_3046) They might possibly say, “We
received grace because we believed;” as if they would attribute the
faith to themselves, and the grace to God. Therefore, the apostle having
said, “Ye are saved through faith,” added,” And that not of yourselves,
but it is the gift of God.” <span id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span
id="xix.iv.xvii-Page_451"></span>And again, lest they should say they
deserved so great a gift by their works, he immediately added, “Not of
works, lest any man should boast.” <span
id="fr_3047"></span>[3048](#fn_3047) Not that he denied good works, or
emptied them of their value, when he says that God renders to every man
according to his works; <span id="fr_3048"></span>[3049](#fn_3048) but
because works proceed from faith, and not faith from works. Therefore it
is from Him that we have works of righteousness, from whom comes also
faith itself, concerning which it is written, “The just shall live by
faith.” <span id="fr_3049"></span>[3050](#fn_3049)
