<span id="xxi.ii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Presumption and Arrogance to Be
Avoided.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.vi-p2"></span>Care must be taken, brethren, beloved of
God, that a man do not lift himself up in opposition to God, when he
says that he does what God has promised. Was not the faith of the
nations promised to Abraham, “and he, giving glory to God, most fully
believed that what He promised He is able also to perform”? <span
id="fr_3428"></span>[3429](#fn_3428.md) He therefore makes the faith of the
nations, who is able to do what He has promised. Further, if God works
our faith, acting in a wonderful manner in our hearts so that we
believe, is there any reason to fear that He cannot do the whole; and
does man on that account arrogate to himself its first elements, that he
may merit to receive its last from God? Consider if in such a way any
other result be gained than that the grace of God is given in some way
or other, according to our merit, and so grace is no more grace. For on
this principle it is rendered as debt, it is not given gratuitously; for
it is due to the believer that his faith itself should be increased by
the Lord, and that the increased faith should be the wages of the faith
begun; nor is it observed when this is said, that this wage is assigned
to believers, not of grace, but of debt. And I do not at all see why the
whole should not be attributed to man,—as he who could originate for
himself what he had not previously, can himself increase what he had
originated,—except that it is impossible to withstand the most manifest
divine testimony by which faith, whence piety takes its beginning, is
shown also to be the gift of God: such as is that testimony that “God
hath dealt to every man the measure of faith;” <span
id="fr_3429"></span>[3430](#fn_3429.md) and that one, “Peace be to the
brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ,” <span id="fr_3430"></span>[3431](#fn_3430.md) and other similar
passages. Man, therefore, unwilling to resist such clear testimonies as
these, and yet desiring himself to have the merit of believing,
compounds as it were with God to claim a portion of faith for himself,
and to leave a portion for Him; and, what is still more arrogant, he
takes the first portion for himself and gives the subsequent to Him; and
so in that which he says belongs to both, he makes himself the first,
and God the second!
