<span id="xvi.v.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[X.\]—The Sacrament of Marriage;
Marriage Indissoluble; The World’s Law About Divorce Different from the
Gospel’s.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xi-p2"></span>It is certainly not fecundity only, the
fruit of which consists of offspring, nor chastity only, whose bond is
fidelity, but also a certain sacramental bond <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088.md) in marriage which is recommended to
believers in wedlock. Accordingly it is enjoined by the apostle:
“Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church.” <span
id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089.md) Of this bond the substance <span
id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090.md) undoubtedly is this, that the man
and the woman who are joined together in matrimony should remain
inseparable as long as they live; and that it should be unlawful for one
consort to be parted from the other, except for the cause of
fornication. <span id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091.md) For this is
preserved in the case of Christ and the Church; so that, as a living one
with a living one, there is no divorce, no separation for ever. And so
complete is the observance of this bond in the city of our God, in His
holy mountain <span id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092.md) —that is to
say, in the Church of Christ—by all married believers, who are
undoubtedly members of Christ, that, although women marry, and men take
wives, for the purpose of procreating children, it is never permitted
one to put away even an unfruitful wife for the sake of having another
to bear children. And whosoever does this is held to be guilty of
adultery by the law of the gospel; though not by this world’s rule,
which allows a divorce between the parties, without even the allegation
of guilt, and the contraction of other nuptial engagements,—a concession
which, the Lord tells us, even the holy Moses extended to the people of
Israel, because of the hardness of their hearts. <span
id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093.md) The same condemnation applies to
the woman, if she is married to another man. So enduring, indeed, are
the rights of marriage between those who have contracted them, as long
as they both live, that even they are looked on as man and wife still,
who have separated from one another, rather than they between whom a new
connection has been formed. For by this new connection they would not be
guilty of adultery, if the previous matrimonial relation did not still
continue. If the husband die, with whom a true marriage was made, a true
marriage is now possible by a connection which would before have been
adultery. Thus between the conjugal pair, as long as they live, the
nuptial bond has a permanent obligation, and can be cancelled neither by
separation nor by union with another. But this permanence avails, in
such cases, only for injury from the sin, not for a bond of the
covenant. In like manner the soul of an apostate, which renounces as it
were its marriage union with Christ, does not, even though it has cast
its faith away, lose the sacrament of its faith, which it received in
the laver of regeneration. It would undoubtedly be given back to him if
he were to return, although he lost it on his departure from Christ. He
retains, however, the sacrament after his apostasy, to the aggravation
of his punishment, not for meriting the reward.
