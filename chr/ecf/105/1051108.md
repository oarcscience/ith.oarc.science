<span id="xxi.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—The Manicheans Do Not
Receive All the Books of the Old Testament, and of the New Only Those
that They Choose.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>But wherefore is “the case of
infants not allowed,” as you write, “to be alleged as an example for
their elders,” by men who do not hesitate to affirm against the
Pelagians that there is original sin, which entered by one man into the
world, and that from one all have gone into condemnation? <span
id="fr_3612"></span>[3613](#fn_3612) This, the Manicheans, too, do not
receive, who not only reject all the Scriptures of the Old Testament as
of authority, but even receive those which belong to the New Testament
in such a manner as that each man, by his own prerogative as it were, or
rather by his own sacrilege, takes what he likes, and rejects what he
does not like,—in opposition to whom I treated in my writings on Free
Will, whence they think that they have a ground of objection against me.
I have been unwilling to deal plainly with the very laborious questions
that occurred, lest my work should become too long, in a case which, as
opposed to such perverse men, I could not have the assistance of the
authority of the sacred Scriptures. And I was able,—as I actually did,
whether anything of the divine testimonies might be true or not, seeing
that I did not definitely introduce them into the
argument,—nevertheless, by certain reasoning, to conclude that God in
all things is to be praised, without any necessity of believing, as they
would have us, that there are two co-eternal, confounded substances of
good and evil.
