<span id="xiv.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—The Same Continued. On the
Works of Unbelievers; Faith is the Initial Principle from Which Good
Works Have Their Beginning; Faith is the Gift of God’s Grace.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxviii-p2"></span>He will perhaps say to this: “It was
not because of his works, but in consequence of his faith, that I said
the apostle was worthy of having all those great graces bestowed upon
him. His faith deserved this distinction, but not his works, which were
not previously good.” Well, then, are we to suppose that faith does not
work? Surely faith does work in a very real way, for it “worketh by
love.” <span id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) Preach up, however, as
much as you like, the works of unbelieving men, we still know how true
and invincible is the statement of this same apostle: “Whatsoever is not
of faith is sin.” <span id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md) The very
reason, indeed, why he so often declares that righteousness is imputed
to us, not out of our works, but our faith, whereas faith rather works
through love, is that no man should think that he arrives at faith
itself through the merit of his works; for it is faith which is the
beginning whence good works first proceed; since (as has already been
stated) whatsoever comes not <span id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span
id="xiv.xxxviii-Page_199"></span>from faith is sin. Accordingly, it is
said to the Church, in the Song of Songs: “Thou shalt come and pass by
from the beginning of faith.” <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md)
Although, therefore, faith procures the grace of producing good works,
we certainly do not deserve by any faith that we should have faith
itself; but, in its bestowal upon us, in order that we may follow the
Lord by its help, “His mercy has prevented us.” <span
id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) Was it we ourselves that gave it to
us? Did we ourselves make ourselves faithful? I must by all means say
here, emphatically: “It is He that hath made us, and not we
ourselves.” <span id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) And indeed
nothing else than this is pressed upon us in the apostle’s teaching,
when he says: “For I declare, through the grace that is given unto me,
to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than
he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
every man the measure of faith.” <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md) Whence, too, arises the well-known
challenge: “What hast thou that thou didst not receive?” <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711.md) inasmuch as we have received even
that which is the spring from which everything we have of good in our
actions takes its beginning.
