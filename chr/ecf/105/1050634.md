<span id="xvi.vi.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—The Pelagians Argue that God
Sometimes Closes the Womb in Anger, and Opens It When Appeased.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>Carefully consider the rest of his
remarks: “This likewise,” says he, “is confirmed by the apostle’s
authority. For when the blessed Paul spoke of the resurrection of the
dead, he said, “Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not
quickened.” <span id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253) And afterwards,
‘But God giveth it a body as it pleaseth Him, and to every seed its own
body.’ If, therefore, God,” says he, “has assigned to human seed, as to
every thing else, its own proper body, which no wise or pious man will
deny, how will you prove that any person is born guilty? Do, I beg of
you, reflect with what a noose this assertion of natural sin is choked.
But come,” he says, “deal more gently with yourself, I pray you. Believe
me, God made even you: it must, however, be confessed, that a serious
error has infected you. For what profaner opinion can be broached than
that either God did not make man, or else that He made him for the
devil; or, at any rate, that the devil framed God’s image, that is,
man,—which clearly is a statement not more absurd than impious? Is
then,” says he, “God so poor in resources, so lacking in all sense of
propriety, as not to have had aught which He could confer on holy men as
their reward, except what the devil, after making them his dupes, might
infuse into them for their vitiation? <span
id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254) Would you like to know, however,
that even in the case of those who are no saints, God can be proved to
have bestowed this power of procreation of children? When Abraham,
struck with fear among a foreign nation, said that Sarah, his wife, was
his sister, it is said that Abimelech, the king of the country, abducted
her for a night’s enjoyment of her. But God, who had the holy woman’s
honour in His keeping, appeared to Abimelech in his sleep, and
restrained the royal audacity; threatening him with death if he went to
the length of violating the wife. Then Abimelech said: ‘Wilt thou, O
Lord, slay an innocent and righteous nation? Did they not tell me that
they were brother and sister? Therefore Abime<span id="page_294">p.
294</span> <span id="xvi.vi.xxviii-Page_294"></span>lech arose early in
the morning, and took a thousand pieces of silver, and sheep, and oxen,
and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and sent
away his wife untouched. But Abraham prayed unto God for Abimelech; and
God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants.’” <span
id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255) Now why he narrated all this at so
great a length, you may find in these few words which he added: “God,”
he says, “at the prayer of Abraham, restored their potency of
generation, which had been taken away from the wombs of even the meanest
servants; because God had closed up every womb in the house of
Abimelech. <span id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256) Consider now,”
says he, “whether that ought to be called a natural evil which sometimes
God when angry takes away, and when appeased restores. He,” says he,
“makes the children both of the pious and of the ungodly, inasmuch as
the circumstance of their being parents appertains to that nature which
rejoices in God as its Author, whilst the fact of their impiety belongs
to the depravity of their desires, and this comes to every person
whatever as the consequence of free will.”
