<span id="xvi.vi.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XXIV.\]—Man Born of Whatever
Parentage is Sinful and Capable of Redemption.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xl-p2"></span>He then says: “You conclude that a human
being, if born of fornication, is not guilty; and if born in wedlock, is
not innocent. Your assertion, therefore, amounts to this, that natural
good may possibly subsist from adulterous connections, while original
sin is actually derived from marriage.” Well now, he here attempts, but
in vain before an intelligent reader, to give a wrong turn to words
which are correct enough. Far be it from us to say, that a human being,
if born in fornication, is not guilty. But we do <span id="page_299">p.
299</span> <span id="xvi.vi.xl-Page_299"></span>affirm, that a human
being, whether he be born in wedlock or in fornication, is in some
respect good, because of the Author of nature, God; we add, however,
that he derives some evil by reason of original sin. Our statement,
therefore, “that natural good can subsist even from adulterous
parentage, but that original sin is derived even from marriage,” does
not amount to what he endeavours to make of it, that one born in
adultery is not guilty, nor innocent when born in wedlock; but that one
who is generated in either condition is guilty, because of original sin;
and that the offspring of either state may be freed by regeneration,
because of the good of nature.
