id="x.iv.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 58 \[XXXVI.\]—“Likeness of Sinful
Flesh” Implies the Reality.</span>

<span id="x.iv.lviii-p2"></span>It is no small concession to the
authority and truthfulness of the inspired pages which those persons
have made, who, although unwilling to admit openly in their writings
that remission of sins is necessary for infants, have yet confessed that
they need redemption. Nothing that they have said differs indeed from
another word, even that which is derived from Christian instruction.
Whilst by those who faithfully read, faithfully hear, and faithfully
hold fast the Holy Scriptures, it cannot be doubted that from that
flesh, which first became sinful flesh by the choice of sin, and which
has been subsequently transmitted to all through successive generations,
there has been propagated a sinful flesh, with the single exception of
that “likeness of sinful flesh,” <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md)
—which *likeness*, however, there could not have been, had there not
been also the *reality* of sinful flesh.
