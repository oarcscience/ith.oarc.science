<span id="xxi.iii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24 \[X.\]—It May Be Objected that
The People of Tyre and Sidon Might, If They Had Heard, Have Believed,
and Have Subsequently Lapsed from Their Faith.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>A certain catholic disputant of no
mean reputation so expounded this passage of the gospel as to say, that
the Lord foreknew that the Tyrians and Sidonians would have afterwards
departed from the faith, although they had believed the miracles done
among them; and that in mercy He did not work those miracles there,
because they would have been liable to severer punishment if they had
forsaken the faith which they had once held, than if they had at no time
held it. In which opinion of a learned and exceedingly acute man, why am
I now concerned to say what is still reasonably to be asked, when even
this opinion serves me for the purpose at which I aim? For if the Lord
in His mercy did not do mighty works among them, since by these works
they might possibly become believers, so that they might not be more
severely punished when they should subsequently become unbelievers, as
He foreknew that they would,—it is sufficiently and plainly shown that
no dead person is judged for those sins which He foreknew that he would
have done, if in some manner he were not helped not to do them; just as
Christ is said to have come to the aid of the Tyrians and Sidonians, if
that opinion be true, who He would rather should not come to the faith
at all, than that by a much greater wickedness they should depart from
the faith, as, if they had come to it, He foresaw they would have done.
Although if it be said, “Why was it not provided that they should rather
believe, and this gift should be bestowed on them, that before they
forsook the faith they should depart from this life”? I am ignorant what
reply can be made. For he who says that to those who would forsake their
faith it would have been granted, as a kindness, that they should not
begin to have what, by a more serious impiety, they would subsequently
forsake, sufficiently indicates that a man is not judged by that which
it is foreknown he would have done ill, if by any act of kindness he may
be prevented from doing it. Therefore it is an advantage also to him who
is taken away, lest wickedness should alter his understanding. But why
this advantage should not have been given to the Tyrians and Sidonians,
that they might believe and be taken away, lest wickedness should alter
their understanding, he perhaps might answer who was pleased in such a
way to solve the above question; but, as far as concerns what I am
discussing, I see it to be enough that, even according to that very
opinion, men are shown not to be judged in respect of those things which
they have not done, even although they may have been foreseen as certain
to have done them. However, as I have said, let us think shame even to
refute this opinion, whereby sins are supposed to be punished in people
who die or have died because they have been foreknown as certain to do
them if they had lived; lest we also may seem to have thought it to be
of some importance, although we would rather repress it by argument than
pass it over in silence.
