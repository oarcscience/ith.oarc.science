<span id="x.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Jesus is the Saviour Even of
Infants.</span>

<span id="x.v.viii-p2"></span>And therefore, if there is an ambiguity in
the apostle’s words when he says, “By one man sin entered into the
world, and death by sin; and so it passed upon all men;” <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) and if it is possible for them to be
drawn aside, and applied to some other sense,—is there anything
ambiguous in this statement: “Except a man be born again of water and of
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God?” <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) Is this, again, ambiguous: “Thou shalt
call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their
sins?” <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) Is there any doubt of
what this means: “The whole need not a physician, but they that are
sick?” <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) —that is, Jesus is not
needed by those who have no sin, but by those who are to be saved from
sin. Is there anything, again, ambiguous in this: “Except men eat the
flesh of the Son of man,” that is, become partakers of His body, “they
shall not have life?” <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) By these
and similar statements, which I now pass over, —absolutely clear in the
light of God, and absolutely certain by His authority,—does not truth
proclaim without ambiguity, that unbaptized infants not only cannot
enter into the kingdom of God, but cannot have everlasting life, except
in the body of Christ, in order that they may be incorporated into which
they are washed <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="x.v.viii-Page_72"></span>in the sacrament of baptism? Does not
truth, without any dubiety, testify that for no other reason are they
carried by pious hands to Jesus (that is, to Christ, the Saviour and
Physician), than that they may be healed of the plague of their sin by
the medicine of His sacraments? Why then do we delay so to understand
the apostle’s very words, of which we perhaps used to have some doubt,
that they may agree with these statements of which we can have no manner
of doubt?
