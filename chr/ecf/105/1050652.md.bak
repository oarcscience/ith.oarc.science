<span id="xvi.vi.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45.—Answer to This Argument: The
Apostle Says We All Sinned in One.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xlvi-p2"></span>Now, there is an answer for him to all
these questions given by the apostle, who censures neither the infant’s
will, which is not yet matured in him for sinning, nor marriage, which,
as such, has not only its institution, but its blessing also, from God;
nor parents, so far as they are parents, who are united together
properly and lawfully for the procreation of children; but he says, “By
one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death
passed upon all men for in him all have sinned.” <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) Now, if these persons would only
receive this statement with catholic hearts and ears, they would not
have rebellious feelings against the grace and faith of Christ, nor
would they vainly endeavour to convert to their own particular and
heretical sense these very clear and manifest words of the apostle, when
they assert that the purport of the passage is to this effect: that Adam
was the first to sin, and that any one who wished afterwards to commit
sin found an example for sinning in him; so that sin, you must know, did
not pass from this one upon all men by birth, but by the imitation of
this one. Whereas it is certain that if the apostle meant this imitation
to be here understood, he would have said that sin had entered into the
world and passed upon all men, not by one man, but rather by the devil.
For of the devil it is written: “They that are on his side do imitate
him.” <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) He used the phrase “by
one man,” from whom the generation of men, of course, had its beginning,
in order to show us that original sin had passed upon all men by
generation.
