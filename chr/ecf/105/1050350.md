<span id="xiii.xviii-p2"></span>XIV. “Again the question must be asked,”
he says, “If man’s nature is good, as nobody but Marcion or Manichæus
will venture to deny, in what way is it good if it is impossible for it
to be free from evil? For that all sin is evil who can gainsay?” We
answer, that man’s nature is both good, and is also able to be free from
evil. Therefore do we earnestly pray, “Deliver us from evil.” <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md) This deliverance, indeed, is not
fully wrought, so long as the soul is oppressed by the body, which is
hastening to corruption. <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) This
process, however, is being effected by grace through faith, so that it
may be said by and by, “O death, where is thy struggle? Where is thy
sting, O death? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is
the law;” <span id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) because the law by
prohibiting sin only increases the desire for it, unless the Holy Ghost
spreads abroad that love, which shall then be full and perfect, when we
shall see face to face.
