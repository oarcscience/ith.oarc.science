<span id="xiv.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 61.—History of the Pelagian Heresy. The
Pelagian Heresy Was Raised by Sundry Persons Who Affected the Monastic
State.</span>

<span id="xiv.lxv-p2"></span>Since it was necessary that the Apostle
Paul’s prediction should be accomplished,—“There must be also heresies
among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among
you,” <span id="fr_1761"></span>[1762](#fn_1761.md) —after the older
heresies, there has been just now introduced, not by bishops or
presbyters or any rank of the clergy, but by certain would-be monks, a
heresy which disputes, under colour of defending free will, against the
grace of God which we have through our Lord Jesus Christ; and endeavours
to overthrow the foundation of the Christian faith of which it is
written, “By one man, death, and by one man the resurrection of the
dead; for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive;” <span id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762.md) and denies God’s help
in our actions, by affirming that, “in order to avoid sin and to fulfil
righteousness, human nature can be sufficient, seeing that it has been
created with free will; and that God’s grace lies in the fact that we
have been so created as to be able to do this by the will, and in the
further fact that God has given to us the assistance of His law and
commandments, and also in that He forgives their past sins when men turn
to Him;” that “in these things alone is God’s grace to be regarded as
consisting, not in the help He gives to us for <span id="page_210">p.
210</span> <span id="xiv.lxv-Page_210"></span>each of our
actions,”—“seeing that a man can be without sin, and keep God’s
commandments easily if he wishes.”
