id="x.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XVIII.\]—A Good Will Comes
from God.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>Men, however, are laboring to find in
our own will some good thing of our own,—not given to us by God; but how
it is to be found I cannot imagine. The apostle says, when speaking of
men’s good works, “What hast thou that thou didst not receive? now, if
thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not
received it?” <span id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569) But, besides this,
even reason itself, which may be estimated in such things by such as we
are, sharply restrains every one of us in our investigations so as that
we may not so defend grace as to seem to take away free will, or, on the
other hand, so assert free will as to be judged ungrateful to the grace
of God, in our arrogant impiety. <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570)
