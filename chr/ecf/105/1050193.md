<span id="xi.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—The Exclusion of Boasting.</span>

<span id="xi.xx-p2"></span>Accordingly he says, “Where is boasting then?
It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay; but by the law of
faith.” <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) He may either mean, the
laudable boasting, which is in the Lord; and that it is *excluded*, not
in the sense that it is driven off so as to pass away, but that it is
clearly manifested so as to stand out prominently. Whence certain
artificers in silver are called “*exclusores*.” <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) In this sense it occurs also in that
passage in the Psalms: “That they may be *excluded*, who have been
proved with silver,” <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) —that is,
that they may stand out in prominence, who have been tried by the word
of God. For in another passage it is said: “The words of the Lord are
pure words, as silver which is tried in the fire.” <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) Or if this be not his meaning, he must
have wished to mention that vicious boasting which comes of pride—that
is, of those who appear to themselves to lead righteous lives, and boast
of their excellence as if they had not received it,—and further to
inform us, that by the law of faith, not by the law of works, this
boasting was *excluded*, in the other sense of shut out and driven away;
because by the law of faith every one learns that whatever good life he
leads he has from the grace of God, and that from no other source
whatever can he obtain the means of becoming perfect in the love of
righteousness.
