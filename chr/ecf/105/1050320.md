<span id="xii.lxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 73.—He Meets Pelagius with Another
Passage from Hilary.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxvii-p2"></span>Now even Job himself is not silent
respecting his own sins; and your friend, <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314) of course, is justly of opinion
that humility must not by any means “be put on the side of falsehood.”
Whatever confession, therefore, Job makes, inasmuch as he is a true
worshipper of God, he undoubtedly makes it in truth. <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315) Hilary, likewise, while expounding
that passage of the psalm in which it is written, “Thou hast despised
all those who turn aside from Thy commandments,” <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316) says: “If God were to despise
sinners, He would despise indeed all men, because no man is without sin;
but it is those who turn away from Him, whom they call *apostates*, that
He despises.” You observe his statement: it is not to the effect that no
man *was* without sin, as if he spoke of the past; but no man *is*
without sin; and on this point, as I have already remarked, I have no
contention with him. But if one refuses to submit to the Apostle
John,—who does not himself declare, “If we were to say we *have had* no
sin,” but “If we say we *have* no sin,” <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317) —how is he likely to show deference
to Bishop Hilary? It is in defence of the grace of Christ that I lift up
my voice, without which grace no man is justified,—just as if natural
free will were sufficient. Nay, He Himself lifts up His own voice in
defence of the same. Let us submit to Him when He says: “Without me ye
can do nothing.” <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318)
