<span id="xiv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[VIII.\]—The Same Continued.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxv-p2"></span>It is not nature, therefore, which, sold as
it is under sin and wounded by the offence, longs for a Redeemer and
Saviour; nor is it the knowledge of the law—through which comes the
discovery, not the expulsion, of sin—which delivers us from the body of
this death; but it is the Lord’s good grace through our Lord Jesus
Christ. <span id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664)

<span id="xiv.xxv-p4"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxv-p4.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[IX.\]—The Same Continued.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxv-p5"></span>This grace is not dying nature, nor the
slaying letter, but the vivifying spirit; for already did he possess
nature with freedom of will, because he said: “To will is present with
me.” <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665) Nature, however, in a
healthy condition and without a flaw, he did not possess, for he said:
“I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth nothing good.” <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666) Already had he the knowledge of
God’s holy law, for he said: “I had not known sin but through the
law;” <span id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667) yet for all that, he
did not possess strength and power to practise and fulfil righteousness,
for he complained: “What I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that
do I.” <span id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668) And again, “How to
accomplish that which is good I find not.” <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669) Therefore it is not from the
liberty of the human will, nor from the precepts of the law, that there
comes deliverance from the body of this death; for both of these he had
already,—the one in his nature, the other in his learning; but all he
wanted was the help of the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
