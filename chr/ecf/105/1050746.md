<span id="xvii.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—His Eighth Error. (See Above in
Book II. 13 \[IX.\].)</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.xiv-p2"></span>Refuse, if you wish to be a catholic,
to believe, or to say, or to teach that “it is of infants, who are
forestalled by death before they are born again in Christ, that the
Scripture says, ‘Speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should
<span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="xvii.vi.xiv-Page_349"></span>alter his understanding, or deceit
beguile his soul. Therefore God hastened to take him away from among the
wicked; for his soul pleased the Lord; and being made perfect in a short
time he fulfilled long seasons.’” <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) For this passage has nothing to do
with those to whom you apply it, but rather belongs to those who, after
they have been baptized and have progressed in pious living, are not
permitted to tarry long on earth,—having been made perfect, not with
years, but with the grace of heavenly wisdom. This error however, of
yours, by which you think that this scripture was spoken of infants who
die unbaptized, does an intolerable wrong to the holy laver itself, if
an infant, who could have been “hurried away” after baptism, has been
“hurried away” before this, for this reason:—“lest wickedness should
alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.” As if this
“wickedness,” and this “deceit which beguiles the soul,” and changes it
for the worse, if it be not before taken away, is to be believed to be
in baptism itself! In a word, since his soul had pleased God, He
hastened to remove him out of the midst of iniquity; and he tarried not
for ever so little while, in order to fulfil in him what He had
predestinated; but preferred to act in opposition to His predestined
purpose, and actually hastened lest what had pleased Him so well in the
unbaptized child should be exterminated by his baptism! As if the dying
infant would perish in that, whither we ought to run with him in our
arms in order to save him from perdition. Who, therefore, in respect of
these words of the Book of Wisdom, could believe, or say, or write, or
quote them as having been written concerning infants who die without
baptism, if he only reflected upon them with proper consideration?
