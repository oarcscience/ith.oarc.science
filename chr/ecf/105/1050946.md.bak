<span id="xix.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—He Proves Out of St. Paul that
Grace is Not Given According to Men’s Merits.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xii-p2"></span>Now there was, no doubt, a decided merit
in the Apostle Paul, but it was an *evil* one, while he persecuted the
Church, and he says of it: “I am not meet to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the Church of God.” <span
id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019.md) And it was while he had this evil
merit that a good one was rendered to him instead of the evil; and,
therefore, he went on at once to say, “But by the grace of God I am what
I am.” <span id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020.md) Then, in order to
exhibit also his free will, he added in the next clause, “And His grace
within me was not in vain, but I have laboured more abundantly than they
all.” This free will of man he appeals to in the case of others also, as
when he says to them, “We beseech you that ye receive not the grace of
God in vain.” <span id="fr_3021"></span>[3022](#fn_3021.md) Now, how could
he so enjoin them, if they received God’s grace in such a manner as to
lose their own will? Nevertheless, lest the will itself should be deemed
capable of doing any good thing without the grace of God, after saying,
“His grace within me was not in vain, but I have laboured more
abundantly than they all,” he immediately added the qualifying clause,
“Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.” <span
id="fr_3022"></span>[3023](#fn_3022.md) In other words, Not I alone, but
the grace of God with me. <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span
id="xix.iv.xii-Page_449"></span>And thus, neither was it the grace of
God alone, nor was it he himself alone, but it was the grace of God with
him. For his call, however, from heaven and his conversion by that great
and most effectual call, God’s grace was alone, because his merits,
though great, were yet evil. Then, to quote one passage more, he says to
Timothy: “But be thou a co-labourer with the gospel, according to the
power of God, who saveth us and calleth us with His holy calling,—not
according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which
was given us in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_3023"></span>[3024](#fn_3023.md) Then, elsewhere, he enumerates his
merits, and gives us this description of their evil character: “For we
ourselves also were formerly foolish, unbelieving, deceived, serving
divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and
hating one another.” <span id="fr_3024"></span>[3025](#fn_3024.md) Nothing,
to be sure, but punishment was due to such a course of evil desert! God,
however, who returns good for evil by His grace, which is not given
according to our merits, enabled the apostle to conclude his statement
and say: “But when the kindness and love of our Saviour God shone upon
us,—not of works of righteousness which we have done, but according to
His mercy He saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renewal of the
Holy Ghost, whom He shed upon us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
Saviour; that, being justified by His grace, we should be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.” <span
