<span id="x.iv.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—Christ the Saviour Even of
Infants; Christ, When an Infant, Was Free from Ignorance and Mental
Weakness.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xlviii-p2"></span>He is therefore the Saviour at once of
infants and of adults, of whom the angel said, “There is born unto you
this day a Saviour;” <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618) and
concerning whom it was declared to the Virgin Mary, <span
id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619) “Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for
He shall save His people from their sins,” where it is plainly shown
that He was called Jesus because of the salvation which He bestows upon
us,—Jesus being tantamount to the Latin *Salvator*, “Saviour.” Who then
can be so bold as to maintain that the Lord Christ is *Jesus* only for
adults and not for infants also? who came in the likeness of sinful
flesh, to destroy the body of sin, with infants’ limbs fitted and
suitable for no use in the extreme weakness of such body, and His
rational soul oppressed with miserable ignorance! Now that such entire
ignorance existed, I cannot suppose in the infant in whom the Word was
made flesh, that He might dwell among us; nor can I imagine that such
weakness of the mental faculty ever existed in the <span id="page_64">p.
64</span> <span id="x.iv.xlviii-Page_64"></span>infant Christ which we
see in infants generally. For it is owing to such infirmity and
ignorance that infants are disturbed with irrational affections, and are
restrained by no rational command or government, but by pains and
penalties, or the terror of such; so that you can quite see that they
are children of that disobedience, which excites itself in the members
of our body in opposition to the law of the mind,—and refuses to be
still, even when the reason wishes; nay, often is either repressed only
by some actual infliction of bodily pain, as for instance by flogging;
or is checked only by fear, or by some such mental emotion, but not by
any admonishing of the will. Inasmuch, however, as in Him there was the
likeness of sinful flesh, He willed to pass through the changes of the
various stages of life, beginning even with infancy, so that it would
seem as if even His flesh might have arrived at death by the gradual
approach of old age, if He had not been killed while young.
Nevertheless, the death is inflicted in sinful flesh as the due of
disobedience, but in the likeness of sinful flesh it was undergone in
voluntary obedience. For when He was on His way to it, and was soon to
suffer it, He said, “Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and hath
nothing in me. But that all may know that I am doing my Father’s will,
arise, let us go hence.” <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620) Having
said these words, He went straightway, and encountered His undeserved
death, having become obedient even unto death.
