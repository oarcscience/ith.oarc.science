id="xii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—Pelagius Argues that Abel Was
Sinless.</span>

<span id="xii.xlviii-p2"></span>This, however, even *he* probably
observed, and therefore he went on to say: “But, granted that it has
sometimes abstained, in a numerous crowd, from narrating the sins of
all; still, in the very beginning of the world, when there were only
four persons in existence, what reason (asks he) have we to give why it
chose not to mention the sins of all? Was it in consideration of the
vast multitude, which had not yet come into existence? or because,
having mentioned only the sins of those who had transgressed, it was
unable to record any of him who had not yet committed sin?” And then he
proceeds to add some words, in which he unfolds this idea with a fuller
and more explicit illustration. “It is certain,” says he, “that in the
earliest age Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel their sons, are mentioned
as being the only four persons then in being. Eve sinned,—the Scripture
distinctly says so much; Adam also transgressed, as the same Scripture
does not fail to inform us; whilst it affords us an equally clear
testimony that Cain also sinned: and of all these it not only mentions
the sins, but also indicates the character of their sins. Now if Abel
had likewise sinned, Scripture would without doubt have said so. But it
has not said so, therefore he committed no sin; nay, it even shows him
to have been righteous. What we read, therefore, let us believe; and
what we do not read, let us deem it wicked to add.”
