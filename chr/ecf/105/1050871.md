<span id="xviii.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Baptism Puts Away All Sins, But It
Does Not at Once Heal All Infirmities.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.v-p2"></span>Baptism, therefore, washes away indeed
all sins—absolutely all sins, whether of deeds or words or thoughts,
whether original or added, whether such as are committed in ignorance or
allowed in knowledge; but it does not take away the weakness which the
regenerate man resists when he fights the good fight, but to which he
consents when as man he is overtaken in any fault; on account of the
former, rejoicing with thanksgiving, but on account of the latter,
groaning in the utterance of prayers. On account of the former, saying,
“What shall I render to the Lord for all that He has given me?” <span
id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696.md) On account of the latter, saying,
“Forgive us our debts.” <span id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697.md) On
account of the former, saying, “I will love Thee, O Lord, my
strength.” <span id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698.md) On account of the
latter, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord; for I am weak.” <span
id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699.md) On account of the former, saying,
“Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord; for He shall pluck my feet out of
the net.” <span id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700.md) On account of the
latter, saying, “Mine eye is troubled with wrath.” <span
id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701.md) And there are innumerable passages
with which the divine writings are filled, which alternately, either in
exultation over God’s benefits or in lamentation over our own evils, are
uttered by children of God by faith as long as they are still children
of this world in respect of the weakness of this life; whom,
nevertheless, God distinguishes from the children of the devil, not only
by the laver of regeneration, but moreover by the righteousness of that
faith which worketh by love, because the just lives by faith. But this
weakness with which we contend, with alternating failure and progress,
even to the death of the body, and which is of great importance as to
what it can overcome in us, shall be consumed by another regeneration,
of which the Lord says, “In the regeneration when the Son of man shall
sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve
thrones,” <span id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702.md) etc. Certainly in
this passage He without doubt calls the last resurrection the
regeneration, which Paul the Apostle also calls both the adoption and
the redemption, where he says, “But even we ourselves, which have the
first-fruits of the Spirit, ourselves also groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, the redemption, of our body.” <span
id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703.md) Have we not been regenerated,
adopted, and redeemed by the holy washing? And yet there remains a
regeneration, an adoption, a redemption, which we ought now patiently to
be waiting for as to come in the end, that we may then be in no degree
any longer children of this world. Whosoever, then, takes away from
baptism that which we only receive by its means, corrupts the faith; but
whosoever attributes to it now that which we shall receive by its means
indeed, but yet hereafter, cuts off hope. For if any one should ask of
me whether we have been saved by baptism, I shall not be able to deny
it, since the apostle says, “He saved us by the washing of regeneration
and renewing of the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704.md) But if he should ask whether by the
same washing He has already absolutely in every way saved us, I shall
answer: It is not so. Because the same apostle also says, “For we are
saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth,
why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, we with
patience wait for it.” <span id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705.md)
Therefore the salvation of man is effected in baptism, because whatever
sin he has derived from his parents is remitted, or whatever, moreover,
he himself has sinned on his own account before baptism; but his
salvation will hereafter be such that he cannot sin at all.
