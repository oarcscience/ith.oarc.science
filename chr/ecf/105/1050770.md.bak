<span id="xvii.vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14 \[X.\]—It is More Excellent to
Know That the Flesh Will Rise Again and Live for Evermore, Than to Learn
Whatever Scientific Men Have Been Able to Teach Us Concerning Its
Nature.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xiv-p2"></span>But although the questions which arise
touching the origin of souls are “higher,” no doubt, than that which
treats of the source whence the breath comes which we inhale and exhale,
you yet believe that those things are “higher” which you have learnt out
of the Holy Scriptures, from which we derive what we learn by faith; and
such as are not traceable by any human minds. Of course it is far more
excellent to know that the flesh will rise again and will live for
evermore, than any thing that scientific men have been able to discover
in it by careful examination, which the soul perceives by no outward
sense, although its presence quickens all the things of which it is
ignorant. It is also far better to know that the soul, which has been
born again and renewed in Christ, will be blessed for ever, than to
discover all that we are ignorant of touching its memory, understanding,
and will. Now these subjects, which I have designated as more excellent
and as better, we could by no means find out, unless we believed them on
the testimony of the inspired Scriptures. These Scriptures you perhaps
think you so thoroughly believe, that you do not hesitate to draw out of
them a definite theory about the origin of souls. Well, then, first of
all, if it be as you suppose, you ought never to have attributed to
human nature itself what man knows by discussion and inquiry about his
own nature and quality, but to God’s gift. Now you asked: “Wherein does
a man differ from the cattle, if he is ignorant of this?” But why need
we read any thing, in order to know this, if we ought already to know it
by the very fact that we are different from cattle? For just as you do
not read anything to me for the purpose of teaching me that I am alive
(my own nature making it impossible that I should be ignorant of this
fact), so if it is an attribute of nature to know this other matter, why
do you produce passages of Scripture for me to believe concerning this
subject? Is it then only those persons who read them that differ from
the cattle? Are we not so created as to be different from brute animals,
even before we can acquire the art of reading? Pray, tell me how it is
that you put in so high a claim for our nature, that by the very
circumstance of its differing from cattle it already knows how to
discuss and inquire into the origin of souls; while at the same time you
make it so inexpert in this knowledge, as to be unable by human
endowment to know this without it believe the divine testimonies.
