<span id="xvi.vi.l-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49 \[XXIX.\]—In Infants Nature is of
God, and the Corruption of Nature of the Devil.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.l-p2"></span>“In a single man rightly is the intention
blamed and the origin praised; because there must be two things to admit
of contraries: in an infant, however, there is but one thing, nature
only; because will has no existence in his case. Now this one thing,”
says he, “is ascribable either to God or to the devil. If nature,” he
goes on to observe, “is of God, there cannot be original evil in it. If
of the devil, there will be nothing on the ground of which man may be
vindicated for the work of God. So that he is completely a Manichean who
maintains original sin.” Let him hear rather what is true in opposition
to all this. In a single man the will is to be blamed, and his nature to
be praised; because there should be two things for the application of
contraries. Still, even in an infant, it is not the case that there is
but one thing only, that is, the nature in which man was created by the
good God; for he has also that corruption, which has passed upon all men
by one, as the apostle wisely says, and not as the folly of Pelagius, or
Cœlestius, or any of their disciples would represent the matter. Of
these two things, then, which we have said exist in an infant, one is
ascribed to God, the other to the devil. From the fact, however, that
(owing to one of the two, even the corruption) both are subjected to the
power of the devil, there really ensues no incongruity; because this
happens not from the power of the devil himself, but of God. In fact,
corruption is subjected to corruption, nature to nature, because the two
are even in the devil; so that whenever those who are beloved and elect
are “delivered from the power of darkness” <span
id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md) to which they are justly exposed,
it is clear enough how great a gift is bestowed on the justified and
good by the good God, who brings good even out of evil.
