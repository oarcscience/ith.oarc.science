<span id="xviii.iii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—What It is to Accomplish What
is Good.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xix-p2"></span>And now does not what follows most
plainly show whence he spoke? “For I know that in me, that is, in my
flesh, dwelleth no good thing”? <span
id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md) For if he had not explained what he
said by the addition of “that is, in my flesh,” it might, perchance, be
otherwise understood, <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span
id="xviii.iii.xix-Page_384"></span>when he said, “in me.” And therefore
he repeats and urges the same thing in another form: “For to will is
present with me, but to perform that which is good is not.” <span
id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575.md) For this is to perform that which
is good, that a man should not even lust. For the good is incomplete
when one lusts, even although a man does not consent to the evil of
lust. “For the good that I would,” says he, “I do not; but the evil that
I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I
that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.” <span
id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576.md) This he repeated impressively, and
as it were to stir up the most slothful from slumber: “I find then that
the law,” said he, “is for me wishing to do good, since evil is present
with me.” <span id="fr_2577"></span>[2578](#fn_2577.md) The law, then, is
for one who would do good, but evil is present from lust, though he does
not consent to this who says, “It is no longer I that do it.”
