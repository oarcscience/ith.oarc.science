<span id="xii.lxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 71 \[LXI.\]—Augustin Replies Against
the Quotations Which Pelagius Had Advanced Out of the Catholic Writers.
Lactantius.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxv-p2"></span>Accordingly, with respect also to the
passages which he has adduced,—not indeed from the canonical Scriptures,
but out of certain treatises of catholic writers,—I wish to meet the
assertions of such as say that the said quotations make for him. The
fact is, these passages are so entirely neutral, that they oppose
neither our own opinion nor his. Amongst them he wanted to class
something out of my own books, thus accounting me to be a person who
seemed worthy of being ranked with them. For this I must not be
ungrateful, and I should be sorry—so I say with unaffected
friendliness—for him to be in error, since he has conferred this honour
upon me. As for his first quotation, indeed, why need I examine it
largely, since I do not see here the author’s name, either because he
has not given it, or because from some casual mistake the copy which
you <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) forwarded to me did not
contain it? Especially as in writings of such authors I feel myself free
to use my own judgment (owing unhesitating assent to nothing but the
canonical Scriptures), whilst in fact there is not a passage which he
has quoted from the works of this anonymous author <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) that disturbs me. “It behooved,”
says he, “for the Master and Teacher of virtue to become most like to
man, that by conquering sin He might show that man is able to conquer
sin.” Now, however this passage may be expressed, its author must see to
it as to what explanation it is capable of bearing. We, indeed, on our
part, could not possibly doubt that in Christ there was no sin to
conquer,—born as He was in *the likeness* of sinful flesh, not in sinful
flesh itself. Another passage is adduced from the same author to this
effect: “And again, that by subduing the desires of the flesh He might
teach us that it is not of necessity that one sins, but of set purpose
and will.” <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) For my own part, I
understand these desires of the flesh (if it is not of its unlawful
lusts that the writer here speaks) to be such as hunger, thirst,
refreshment after fatigue, and the like. For it is through these,
however faultless they be in themselves, that some men fall into sin,—a
result which was far from our blessed Saviour, even though, as we see
from the evidence of the gospel, these affections were natural to Him
owing to His likeness to sinful flesh.
