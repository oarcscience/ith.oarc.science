<p><a name="x.iv.i-p2"></A><span class="c16"><a name="x.iv.i-p2.1"></A>We</span> have, my dearest Marcellinus, discussed at sufficient length, I think, in the former book the baptism of infants,&#8212;how that it is given to them not only for entrance into the kingdom of God, but also for attaining salvation and eternal life, which none can have without the kingdom of God, or without that union with the Saviour Christ, wherein He has redeemed us by His blood. I undertake in the present book to discuss and explain the question, Whether there lives in this world, or has yet lived, or ever will live, any one without any sin whatever, except &#8220;the one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">445</FONT></A>
&#8212;with as much care and ability as He may Himself vouchsafe to me. And should there occasionally arise in this discussion, either inevitably or casually from the argument, any question about the baptism or the sin of infants, I must neither be surprised nor must I shrink from giving the best answer I can, at such emergencies, to whatever point challenges my attention.</p>
