<span id="xv.iii.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44 \[XL.\]—Pelagius Once More
Guards Himself Against the Necessity of Grace.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xliv-p2"></span>Then, again, in the work addressed to
the holy virgin, <span id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891.md) of which we
have spoken already, there is this passage: “Let us submit ourselves to
God, and by doing His will let us merit the divine grace; and let us the
more easily, by the help of the Holy Ghost, resist the evil spirit.”
Now, in these words of his, it is plain enough that he regards us as
assisted by the grace of the Holy Ghost, not because we are unable to
resist the tempter without Him by the sheer capacity of our nature, but
in order that we may resist *more easily.* With respect, however, to the
quantity and quality, whatever these might be, of this assistance, we
may well believe that he made them consist of the additional knowledge
which the Spirit reveals to us through teaching, and which we either
cannot, or scarcely can, possess by nature. Such are the particulars
which I have been able to discover in the book which he addressed to the
virgin of Christ, and wherein he seems to confess grace. Of what purport
and kind these are, you of course perceive.
