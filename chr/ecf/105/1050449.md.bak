id="xiv.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 64.—How the Bishops Cleared Pelagius
of Those Charges.</span>

<span id="xiv.lxviii-p2"></span>These four dogmas, thus connected with
the name of Cœlestius, were therefore not approved by the bishops in
their judgment, in the sense in which Cœlestius was said to have set
them forth but in the sense which Pelagius gave to them in his reply.
For they saw clearly enough, that it is one thing to be without sin, and
another thing to live holily and righteously, as Scripture testifies
that some lived even before the coming of Christ. And that although the
Church here on earth is not without spot or wrinkle, she is yet both
cleansed from every spot and wrinkle by the laver of regeneration, and
in this state the Lord would have her continue. And continue she
certainly will, for without doubt she shall reign without spot or
wrinkle in an everlasting felicity. And that the perpetual virginity,
which is not commanded, is unquestionably more than the purity of wedded
life, which is commanded—although virginity is persevered in by many
persons, who, notwithstanding, are not without sin. And that all those
graces which he enumerates in a certain passage were possessed by the
Apostle Paul; and yet, for all that, either they could quite understand,
in regard to his having been worthy to receive them, that the merit was
not according to his works, but rather, in some way, according to
predestination (for the apostle says himself: “I am not meet to be
called an apostle;”) <span id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md) or else
their attention was not arrested by the sense which Pelagius gave to the
word, as he himself viewed it. Such are the points on which the bishops
pronounced the agreement of Pelagius with the doctrines of godly truth.
