<span id="x.iv.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35 \[XXI.\]—Adam and Eve; Obedience
Most Strongly Enjoined by God on Man.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxxv-p2"></span>When the first human beings—the one man
Adam, and his wife Eve who came out of him—willed not to obey the
commandment which they had received from God, a just and deserved
punishment overtook them. The Lord had threatened that, on the day they
ate the forbidden fruit, they should surely die. <span
id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) Now, inasmuch as they had received the
permission of using for food every tree that grew in Paradise, among
which God had planted the tree of life, but had been forbidden to
partake of one only tree, which He called the tree of knowledge of good
and evil, to signify by this name the consequence of their discovering
whether what good they would experience if they kept the prohibition, or
what evil if they transgressed it: they are no doubt rightly considered
to have abstained from the forbidden food previous to the malignant
persuasion of the devil, and to have used all which had been allowed
them, and therefore, among all the others, and before all the others,
the tree of life. For what could be more absurd than to suppose that
they partook of the fruit of other trees, but not of that which had been
equally with others granted to them, and which, by its especial virtue,
prevented even their animal bodies from undergoing change through the
decay of age, and from aging into death, applying this benefit from its
own body to the man’s body, and in a mystery demonstrating what is
conferred by wisdom (which it symbolized) on the rational soul, even
that, quickened by its fruit, it should not be changed into the decay
and death of iniquity? For of her it is rightly said, “She is a tree of
life to them that lay hold of her.” <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588.md) Just as the one tree was for the
bodily Paradise, the other is for the spiritual; the one affording a
vigour to the senses of the outward man, the other to those of the inner
man, such as will abide without any change for the worse through time.
They therefore served God, since that dutiful obedience was committed to
them, by which alone God can be worshipped. And it was not possible more
suitably to intimate the inherent importance of obedience, or its sole
sufficiency securely to keep the rational creature under the Creator,
than by forbidding a tree which was not in itself evil. For God forbid
that the Creator of good things, who made all things, “and behold they
were very good,” <span id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) should plant
anything evil amidst the fertility of even that material Paradise.
Still, however, in order that he might show man, to whom submission to
such a Master would be very useful, how much good belonged simply to
obedience (and this was all that He had demanded of His servant, and
this would be of advantage not so much for the lordship of the Master as
for the profit of the servant), they were forbidden the use of a tree,
which, if it had not been for the prohibition, they might have used
without suffering any evil result whatever; and from this circumstance
it may be clearly understood, that whatever evil they brought on
themselves because they made use of it in spite of the prohibition, the
tree did not produce from any noxious or pernicious quality <span
id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span id="x.iv.xxxv-Page_59"></span>in its
fruit, but entirely on account of their violated obedience.
