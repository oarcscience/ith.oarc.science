<span id="x.iii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—Infants Not Enlightened as Soon
as They are Born.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxxvi-p2"></span>Some, however, understand that as soon
as children are born they are enlightened; and they derive this opinion
from the passage: “That was the true Light, which lighteth every one
that cometh into the world.” <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321)
Well, if this be the case, it is quite astonishing how it can be that
those who are thus enlightened by the only-begotten Son, who was in the
beginning the Word with God, and \[Himself\] God, are not admitted into
the kingdom of God, nor are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.
For that such an inheritance is not bestowed upon them except through
baptism, even they who hold the opinion in question do acknowledge.
Then, again, if they are (though already illuminated) thus unfit for
entrance into the kingdom of God, they at all events ought gladly to
receive the baptism, by which they are fitted for it; but, strange to
say, we see how reluctant infants are to submit to baptism, resisting
even with strong crying. And this ignorance of theirs we think lightly
of at their time of life, so that we fully administer the sacraments,
which we know to be serviceable to them, even although they struggle
against them. And why, too, does the apostle say, “Be not children in
understanding,” <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322) if their minds
have been already enlightened with that true Light, which is the Word of
God?
