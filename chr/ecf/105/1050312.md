<span id="xii.lxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 65 \[LV.\]—“This Body of Death,” So
Called from Its Defect, Not from Its Substance.</span>

<span id="xii.lxix-p2"></span>Now, I ask, when did our nature lose that
liberty, which he craves to be given to him when he says: “Who shall
liberate me?” <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md) For even he
finds no fault with the substance of the flesh when he expresses his
desire to be liberated from the body of this death, since the nature of
the body, as well as of the soul, must be attributed to the good God as
the author thereof. But what he speaks of undoubtedly concerns the
offences of the body. Now from the body the death of the body separates
us; whereas the offences contracted from the body remain, and their just
punishment awaits them, as the rich man found in hell. <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) From these it was that he was
unable to liberate himself, who said: “Who shall liberate me from the
body of this death?” <span id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md) But
whensoever it was that he lost this liberty, at least there remains that
“inseparable capacity” of nature,—he has the ability from natural
resources,—he has the volition from free will. Why does he seek the
sacrament of baptism? Is it because of past sins, in order that they may
be forgiven, since they cannot be undone? Well, suppose you acquit and
release a man on these terms, he must still utter the old cry; for he
not only wants to be mercifully let off from punishment for past
offences, but to be strengthened and fortified against sinning for the
time to come. For he “delights in the law of God, after the inward man;
but then he sees another law in his members, warring against the law of
his mind.” <span id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) Observe, he sees
that there *is*, not recollects that there *was*. It is a present
pressure, not a past memory. And he sees the other law not only
“warring,” but even “bringing him into captivity to the law of sin,
which *is*”(not which *was*) “in his members.” <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) Hence comes that cry of his: “O
wretched man that I am! who shall liberate me from the body of this
death?” <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) Let him pray, let him
entreat for the help of the mighty Physician. Why gainsay that prayer?
Why cry down that entreaty? Why shall the unhappy suitor be hindered
from begging for the mercy of Christ,—and that too by Christians? For,
it was even they who were accompanying Christ that tried to prevent the
blind man, by clamouring him down, from begging for light; but even
amidst the din and throng of the gainsayers He hears the
suppliant; <span id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) whence the
response: “The grace of God, through Jesus Christ out Lord.” <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289.md)
