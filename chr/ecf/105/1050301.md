<span id="xii.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 54 \[XLVI.\]—There is No
Incompatibility Between Necessity and Free Will.</span>

<span id="xii.lviii-p2"></span>Now how does all this apply to our
subject? Let us see what he makes out of it. “Whatever,” says he, “is
fettered by natural necessity is deprived of determination of will and
deliberation.” Well, now, here lies a question; for it is the height of
absurdity for us to say that it does not belong to our will that we wish
to be happy, on the ground that it is absolutely impossible for us to be
unwilling to be happy, by reason of some indescribable but amiable
coercion of our nature; nor dare we maintain that God has not the will
but the necessity of righteousness, because He cannot will to sin.
