<span id="xviii.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[IX.\]—He Interprets the
Scriptures Which the Pelagians Make Ill Use of.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xix-p2"></span>But assuredly, as to what is written,
“The preparation of the heart is man’s part, and the answer of the
tongue is from the Lord,” <span id="fr_2657"></span>[2658](#fn_2657.md)
they are misled by an imperfect understanding, so as to think that to
prepare the heart—that is, to begin good—pertains to man without the aid
of God’s grace. Be it far from the children of promise thus to
understand it! As if, when they heard the Lord saying, “Without me ye
can do nothing,” <span id="fr_2658"></span>[2659](#fn_2658.md) they would
convict Him by saying, “Behold without Thee we can prepare the heart;”
or when they heard from Paul the apostle, “Not that we are sufficient to
think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God,” <span
id="fr_2659"></span>[2660](#fn_2659.md) as if they would also convict him,
saying, “Behold, we are sufficient of ourselves to prepare our heart,
and thus also to think some good thing; for who can without good thought
prepare his heart for good?” Be it far from any thus to understand the
passage, except the proud maintainers of free will and forsakers of the
catholic faith! Therefore, since it is written, “It is man’s part to
prepare the heart, and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord,” it is
that man prepares his heart, not, however, without the aid of God, who
so touches the heart that man prepares the heart. But in the answer of
the tongue—that is, in that which the divine tongue answers to the
prepared heart—man has no part; but the whole is from the Lord God.
