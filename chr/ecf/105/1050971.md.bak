<span id="xix.iv.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XVIII.\]—The Love Which
Fulfils the Commandments is Not of Ourselves, But of God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxxvii-p2"></span>All these commandments, however,
respecting love or charity <span id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md)
(which are so great, and such that whatever action a man may think he
does well is by no means well done if done without love) would be given
to men in vain if they had not free choice of will. But forasmuch as
these precepts are given in the law, both old and new (although in the
new came the grace which was promised in the old, but the law without
grace is the letter which killeth, but in grace the Spirit which giveth
life), from what source is there in men the love of God and of one’s
neighbour but from God Himself? For indeed, if it be not of God but of
men, the Pelagians have gained the victory; but if it come from God,
then we have vanquished the Pelagians. Let, then, the Apostle John sit
in judgment between us; and let him say to us, “Beloved, let us love one
another.” <span id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) Now, when they
begin to extol themselves on these words of John, and to ask why this
precept is addressed to us at all if we have not of our own selves to
love one another, the same apostle proceeds at once, to their confusion,
to add, “For love is of God.” <span id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md)
It is not of ourselves, therefore, but it is of God. Wherefore, then, is
it said, “Let us love one another, for love is of God,” unless it be as
a precept to our free will, admonishing it to seek the gift of God? Now,
this would be indeed a thoroughly fruitless admonition if the will did
not previously receive some donation of love, which might seek to be
enlarged so as to fulfil whatever command was laid upon it. When it is
said, “Let us love one another,” it is law; when it is said, “For love
is of God,” it is grace. For God’s “wisdom carries law and mercy upon
her tongue.” <span id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md) Accordingly, it
is written in the Psalm, “For He who gave the law will give
blessings.” <span id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md)
