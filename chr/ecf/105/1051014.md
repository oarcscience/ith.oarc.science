<span id="xx.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—The Incarnation of the
Word.</span>

<span id="xx.xxxiii-p2"></span>Hence, although these do not now require
a grace more joyous for the present, they nevertheless need a more
powerful grace; and what grace is more powerful than the only-begotten
Son of God, equal to the Father and co-eternal, made man for them, and,
without any sin of His own, either original or actual, crucified by men
who were sinners? And although He rose again on the third day, never to
die any more, He yet bore death for men and gave life to the dead, so
<span id="page_484">p. 484</span> <span
id="xx.xxxiii-Page_484"></span>that redeemed by His blood, having
received so great and such a pledge, they could say, “If God be for us,
who is against us? He who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up
for us all, how has He not with Him also given to us all things?” <span
id="fr_3348"></span>[3349](#fn_3348) God therefore took upon Him our
nature—that is, the rational soul and flesh of the man Christ—by an
undertaking singularly marvellous, or marvellously singular; so that
with no preceding merits of His own righteousness He might in such wise
be the Son of God from the beginning, in which He had begun to be man,
that He, and the Word which is without beginning, might be one person.
For there is no one blinded by such ignorance of this matter and the
Faith as to dare to say that, although born of the Holy Spirit and the
Virgin Mary the Son of man, yet of His own free will by righteous living
and by doing good works, without sin, He deserved to be the Son of God;
in opposition to the gospel, which says, “The Word was made
flesh.” <span id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349) For where was this
made flesh except in the Virginal womb, whence was the beginning of the
man Christ? And, moreover, when the Virgin asked how that should come to
pass which was told her by the angel, the angel answered, “The Holy
Ghost shall come over on to thee and the power of the Highest shall
overshadow thee, therefore that holy thing that shall be born of thee
shall be called the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_3350"></span>[3351](#fn_3350) “Therefore,” he said; not because
of works of which certainly of a yet unborn infant there are none; but
“therefore,” because “the Holy Ghost shall come over on to thee, and the
power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, that holy thing which shall
be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.” That nativity,
absolutely gratuitous, conjoined, in the unity of the person, man to
God, flesh to the Word! Good works followed that nativity; good works
did not merit it. For it was in no wise to be feared that the human
nature taken up by God the Word in that ineffable manner into a unity of
person, would sin by free choice of will, since that taking up itself
was such that the nature of man so taken up by God would admit into
itself no movement of an evil will. Through this Mediator God makes
known that He makes those whom He redeemed by His blood from evil,
everlastingly good; and Him He in such wise assumed that He never would
be evil, and, not being made out of evil, would always be good. <span
