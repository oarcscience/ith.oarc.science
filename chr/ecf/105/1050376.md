<span id="xiii.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX—(40.) The Ninth Passage.</span>

<span id="xiii.xliv-p2"></span>“This passage, too,” says he, “is quoted
by them: ‘It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of
God that showeth mercy.’” <span id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) And
he observes that the answer to be given to them is derived from the same
apostle’s words in another passage: “Let him do what he will.” <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) And he adds another passage from
the Epistle to Philemon, where, speaking of Onesimus, \[St. Paul says\]:
“‘Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have
ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel. But without thy mind
would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of
necessity, but willingly.’ <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md)
Likewise, in Deuteronomy: ‘Life and death hath He set before thee, and
good and evil: . . .choose thou life, that thou mayest live.’ <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) So in the book of Solomon: ‘God
from the beginning made man, and left him in the hand of His counsel;
and He added for him commandments and precepts: if thou wilt—to perform
acceptable faithfulness for the time to come, they shall save thee. He
hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thine hand unto
whether thou wilt. Before man are good and evil, and life and death;
poverty and honour are from the Lord God.’ <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) So again in Isaiah we read: ‘If ye
be willing, and hearken unto me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but
if ye be not willing, and hearken not to me, the sword shall devour you:
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this.’” <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) Now with all their efforts of
disguise they here betray their purpose; for they plainly attempt to
controvert the grace and mercy of God, which we desire to obtain
whenever we offer the prayer, “Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heaven;” <span id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md) or again this, “Lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) For indeed why do we present such
petitions in earnest supplication, if the result is of him that willeth,
and him that runneth, but not of God that showeth mercy? Not that the
result is without our will, but that our will does not accomplish the
result, unless it receive the divine assistance. Now the wholesomeness
of faith is this, that it makes us “seek, that we may find; ask, that we
may receive; and knock, that it may be opened to us.” <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) Whereas the man who gainsays it,
does really shut the door of God’s mercy against himself. I am unwilling
to say more touching so important a matter, because I do better in
committing it to the groans of the faithful, than to words of my own.
