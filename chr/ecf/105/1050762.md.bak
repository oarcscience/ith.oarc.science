<span id="xvii.vii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[V.\]—Questions About the Nature
of the Body are Sufficiently Mysterious, and Yet Not Higher Than Those
of the Soul.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.vi-p2"></span>What do you say to the statement, that
amongst the works of God there are some which it is more difficult to
know than even God Himself,—so far, indeed, as He can be an object of
knowledge to us at all? For we have learnt that God is a Trinity; but to
this very day we do not know how many kinds of animals, not even of land
animals which were able to enter Noah’s ark, <span
id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) He has created—unless by some happy
chance you have ascertained this fact. Again, in the Book of Wisdom it
is written, “For if they were able to prevail so much, that they could
know and estimate the world; how is it that they did not more easily
find out the Lord thereof?” <span id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md)
Is it because the subject before us is *within* us that it is therefore
not too high for us? For it must be granted that the nature of our soul
is a more internal thing than our body. As if the soul has been no
better able to explore the body itself externally by the eyes of that
body than internally by its own means. For what is there in the inward
parts of the body where the soul does not exist? But yet, even with
regard to these several inner and vital portions of our frame, the soul
has examined and searched them out by the bodily eyes; and all that it
has succeeded in learning of them it has acquired by means of the eyes
of the body; and, without doubt, all the material substance was there,
even when the soul knew not of it. Since also our inward parts are
incapable of living without the soul, it follows that the soul has been
more able to give them life than to know them. Well, then, is the soul’s
body a higher object for its knowledge than the soul’s own self? And
therefore if it wishes to inquire and consider when human seed is
converted into blood, when into solid flesh; when the bones begin to
harden, and when to fill with marrow; how many kinds of veins and nerves
there are; by what channels and circuits the former serve for irrigation
and the latter for ligature to the entire body; whether the skin is to
be reckoned among the nerves, and the teeth among the bones,—for they
show some difference, inasmuch as they have no marrow; and in what
respect the nails differ from both, being similar to them in hardness,
while they possess a quality in common with the hair, in being capable
of growing and being cut; what, again, is the use of those veins wherein
air, instead of blood, circulates, which they call *the arteries* <span
id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) —if, I repeat, the soul desired to
come to know these and similar points respecting the nature of its body,
ought it then to be said to a man, “Seek not out the things that are too
high for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength?”
But, if the inquiry be made into the soul’s own origin, of which subject
it knows nothing, the matter then, forsooth, is not too high or beyond
one’s strength to be capable of apprehension? And you deem it an absurd
thing, and incompatible with reason, for the soul not to know whether it
is inbreathed by God, or whether it is derived from the parents,
although it does not remember this event as soon as it is past, and
reckons it among the things which it has forgotten beyond recall,—like
infancy, and all other stages of life which followed close upon birth,
though doubtless, when they happened, they were not unaccompanied with
sensation. But yet you do not deem it absurd or unreasonable that it
should be ignorant of the body which is subject to it, and should know
nothing whatever about incidents pertaining to it which are not in the
category of things that are past, but of present facts, <span
id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span id="xvii.vii.vi-Page_357"></span>—as
to whether it sets the veins in motion in order to produce life in the
body, but the nerves in order to operate by the limbs of the body; and
if so, why it does not move the nerves except at its especial will,
whereas it affects the pulsations of the veins without intermission,
even without willing; from what part of the body that which they call
the <span class="Greek"><span id="xvii.vii.vi-p5.1"></span>ἡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xvii.vii.vi-p5.2"></span>γεμονικόν</span> (the
authoritative part of the soul, the reason) exercises its universal
rule, whether from the heart or from the brain, or by a distribution,
the motions from the heart and the sensations from the brain,—or from
the brain, both the sensations and voluntary motions, but from the
heart, the involuntary pulsations of the veins; and once more, if it
does both of these from the brain, how is it that it has the sensations,
even without willing, while it does not move the limbs except it wills?
Inasmuch, then, as only the soul itself does all this in the body, how
is it that it knows not what it does? or whence its power to do it? And
it is no disgrace to it to be so ignorant. Then do you suppose it to be
a discredit if it knows not whence or how it was itself made, since it
certainly did not make itself? Well, then, none know how or whence the
soul effects all its action in the body; do you not therefore think that
it, too, appertains to those things which are said to be “too high for
us, and above our strength”?

<span id="xvii.vii.vi-p5"></span> These vessels which carry the blood
from the heart were formerly supposed, from being found empty after
death, to contain only air; and hence, indeed, their name,—for “the
artery” was originally the windpipe. Comp. Cicero (*De Nat. Deor*. ii.
55, 138): “Sanguis per *venas* in omne corpus diffunditur, et spiritus
per *arterias*”: i.e. Blood is diffused throughout the body by the
*veins*, and air by the *arteries*.
