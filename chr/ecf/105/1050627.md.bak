<span id="xvi.vi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Original Sin is Derived from the
Faulty Condition of Human Seed.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxi-p2"></span>This, however, I would not say, as
implying at all that we must look for some other creator than the
supreme and true God, of either human seed or of man himself who comes
from the seed; but as meaning, that the seed would have issued from the
human being by the quiet and normal obedience of his members to his
will’s command, if sin had not preceded. The question now before us does
not concern the nature of human seed, but its corruption. Now the
*nature* has God for its author; it is from its corruption that original
sin is derived. If, indeed, the seed had itself no corruption, what
means that passage in the Book of Wisdom, “Not being ignorant that they
were a naughty generation, and that their malice was inbred, and that
their cogitation would never be changed; for their seed was accursed
from the beginning”? <span id="fr_2237"></span>[2238](#fn_2237.md) Now
whatever may be the particular application of these words, they are
spoken of mankind. How, then, is the malice of every man inbred, and his
seed cursed from the beginning, unless it be in respect of the fact,
that “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for in him all have sinned”? <span
id="fr_2238"></span>[2239](#fn_2238.md) But where is the man whose “evil
cogitation can never be changed,” unless because it cannot be effected
by himself, but only by divine grace; without the assistance of which,
what are human beings, but that which the Apostle Peter says of them,
when he describes them as “natural brute beasts made to be taken and
destroyed”? <span id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239.md) Accordingly, the
Apostle Paul, in a certain passage, having both conditions in view,—even
the wrath of God with which we are born, and the grace whereby we are
delivered,—says: “Among whom also we all had our conversation in times
past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us,
even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ;
by whose grace we are saved.” <span id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md)
What, then, is <span id="page_291">p. 291</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.xxi-Page_291"></span>man’s “natural malice,” and “the seed
cursed from the beginning;” and what are “the natural brute beasts made
to be taken and destroyed,” and what the “by nature children of wrath”?
Was this the condition of the nature which was formed in Adam? God
forbid! Inasmuch as his pure nature, however, was corrupted in him, it
has run on in this condition by natural descent through all, and still
is running; so that there is no deliverance for it from this ruin,
except by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
