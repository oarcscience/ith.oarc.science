<span id="xxi.iii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34 \[XIV.\]—The Doctrine of
Predestination Not Opposed to the Advantage of Preaching.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxxvi-p2"></span>But they say that the “definition of
predestination is opposed to the advantage of preaching,” <span
id="fr_3636"></span>[3637](#fn_3636) —as if, indeed, it were opposed to
the preaching of the apostle! Did not that teacher of the heathen so
often, in faith and truth, both commend predestination, and not cease to
preach the word of God? Because he said, “It is God that worketh in you
both to will and to <span id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.xxxvi-Page_539"></span>do for His good pleasure,” <span
id="fr_3637"></span>[3638](#fn_3637) did he not also exhort that we
should both will and do what is pleasing to God? or because he said, “He
who hath begun a good work in you shall carry it on even unto the day of
Christ Jesus,” <span id="fr_3638"></span>[3639](#fn_3638) did he on that
account cease to persuade men to begin and to persevere unto the end?
Doubtless, our Lord Himself commanded men to believe, and said, “Believe
in God, believe also in me:” <span id="fr_3639"></span>[3640](#fn_3639)
and yet His opinion is not therefore false, nor is His definition idle
when He says, “No man cometh unto me”—that is, no man believeth in
me—“except it has been given him of my Father.” <span
id="fr_3640"></span>[3641](#fn_3640) Nor, again, because this definition
is true, is the former precept vain. Why, therefore, do we think the
definition of predestination useless to preaching, to precept, to
exhortation, to rebuke,—all which things the divine Scripture repeats
frequently,—seeing that the same Scripture commends this doctrine?
