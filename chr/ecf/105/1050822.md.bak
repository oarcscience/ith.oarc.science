<span id="xviii.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XI.\]—What It is to Be
Delivered from the Body of This Death.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>For when he says also, “Who shall
deliver me from the body of this death?” <span
id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582.md) who can deny that when the apostle
said this he was still in the body of this death? And certainly the
wicked are not delivered from this, to whom the same bodies are returned
for eternal torment. Therefore, to be delivered from the body of this
death is to be healed of all the weakness of fleshly lust, and to
receive the body, not for penalty, but for glory. With this passage also
those words are sufficiently in harmony: “Ourselves also, which have the
first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, the redemption, of our body.” For surely we
groan with that groaning wherein we say, “O wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from the body of this death?” That also where he says,
“For what I do, I know not;” what else is it than: “I will not, I do not
approve, I do not consent, I do not do”? Otherwise it is con<span

id="xviii.iii.xxiii-Page_385"></span>trary to what he said above, “By
the law is the knowledge of sin,” and, “I had not known sin but by the
law,” and, “Sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me by that
which is good.” For how did he know sin, of which he was ignorant, by
the law? How does sin which is not known appear? Therefore it is said,
“I know not,” for “I do not,” because I myself commit it with no consent
of mine; in the same way in which the Lord will say to the wicked, “I
know you not,” <span id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583.md) although,
beyond a doubt, nothing can be hid from Him; and as it is said, “Him who
had not known sin,” <span id="fr_2584"></span>[2585](#fn_2584.md) which
means who had not done sin, for He had not known what He condemned.
