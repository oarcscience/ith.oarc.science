id="xviii.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Nothing is Commanded to Man
Which is Not Given by God.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>Since these things are so, I see
that nothing is commanded to man by the Lord in the Holy Scriptures, for
the sake of trying his free will, which is not found either to begin by
His goodness, or to be asked in order to demonstrate the aid of grace;
nor does man at all begin to be changed by the beginning of faith from
evil to good, unless the unbought and gratuitous mercy of God effects
this in him. Of which one recalling his thought, as we read in the
Psalms, says, “Shall God forget to be gracious? or will He restrain His
mercies in His anger? And I said, Now have I begun; this change is of
the right hand of the Most High.” <span
id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674) When, therefore, he had said, “Now
have I begun,” he does not say, “This change is of my will,” but “of the
right hand of the Most High.” So, therefore, let God’s grace be thought
of, that from the beginning of his good changing, even to the end of his
completion, he who glorieth may glory in the Lord; because, as no one
can perfect good without the Lord, so no one can begin it without the
Lord. But let this be the end of this book, that the attention of the
reader may be refreshed and strengthened for what follows.
