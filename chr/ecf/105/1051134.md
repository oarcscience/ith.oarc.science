id="xxi.iii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52.—Previous Writings
Anticipatively Refuted the Pelagian Heresy.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.liv-p2"></span>But in respect of their saying “that it
was not necessary that the hearts of so many people of little
intelligence should be disquieted by the uncertainty of this kind of
disputation, since the catholic faith has been defended for so many
years, with no less advantage, without this definition of
predestination, as well against others as especially against the
Pelagians, in so many books that have gone before, as well of catholics
and others as our own;”  <span id="fr_3689"></span>[3690](#fn_3689.md) —I
much wonder that they should say this, and not observe—to say nothing of
other writings in this place—that those very treatises of mine were both
composed and published before the Pelagians had begun to appear; and
that they do not see in how many passages of those treatises I was
unawares cutting down a future Pelagian heresy, by preaching the grace
by which God delivers us from evil errors and from our habits, without
any preceding merits of ours,—doing this according to His gratuitous
mercy. And this I began more fully to apprehend in that disputation
which I wrote to Simplicianus, the bishop of the Church of Milan, of
blessed memory, in the beginning of my episcopate, when, moreover, I
both perceived and asserted that the beginning of faith is God’s gift.
