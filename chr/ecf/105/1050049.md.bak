<span id="x.iii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31 \[XXII.\]—He Refutes Those Who
Suppose that Souls, on Account of Sins Committed in Another State, are
Thrust into Bodies Suited to Their Merits, in Which They are More or
Less Tormented.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxxi-p2"></span>Perhaps, however, the now exploded and
rejected opinion must be resumed, that souls which once sinned in their
heavenly abode, descend by stages and degrees to bodies suited to their
deserts, and, as a penalty for their previous life, are more or less
tormented by corporeal chastisements. To this opinion Holy Scripture
indeed presents a most manifest contradiction; for when recommending
divine grace, it says: “For the children being not yet born, neither
having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to
election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was
said, The elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) And yet they who entertain such an
opinion are actually unable to escape the perplexities of this question,
but, embarrassed and straitened by them, are compelled to exclaim like
others, “O the depth!” For whence does it come to pass that a person
shall from his earliest boyhood show greater moderation, mental
excellence, and temperance, and shall to a great extent conquer <span
id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span id="x.iii.xxxi-Page_27"></span>lust,
shall hate avarice, detest luxury, and rise to a greater eminence and
aptitude in the other virtues, and yet live in such a place as to be
unable to hear the grace of Christ preached?—for “how shall they call on
Him in whom they have not believed? or how shall they believe in Him of
whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a
preacher?” <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) While another man,
although of a slow mind, addicted to lust, and covered with disgrace and
crime, shall be so directed as to hear, and believe, and be baptized,
and be taken away,—or, if permitted to remain longer here, lead the rest
of his life in a manner that shall bring him praise? Now where did these
two persons acquire such diverse deserts,—I do not say, that the one
should believe and the other not believe, for that is a matter for a
man’s own will; but that the one should hear in order to believe, and
that the other should not hear, for this is not within man’s power?
Where, I say, did they acquire diverse deserts? If they had indeed
passed any part of their life in heaven, so as to be thrust down, or to
sink down, to this world, and to tenant such bodily receptacles as are
congruous to their own former life, then of course that man ought to be
supposed to have led the better life previous to his present mortal
body, who did not much deserve to be burdened with it, so as both to
have a good disposition, and to be importuned by milder desires which he
could easily overcome; and yet he did not deserve to have that grace
preached to him whereby alone he could be delivered from the ruin of the
second death. Whereas the other, who was hampered with a grosser body,
as a penalty—so they suppose—for worse deserts, and was accordingly
possessed of obtuser affections, whilst he was in the violent ardour of
his lust succumbing to the snares of the flesh, and by his wicked life
aggravating his former sins, which had brought him to such a pass, by a
still more abandoned course of earthly pleasures,—either heard upon the
cross, “To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise,” <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) or else joined himself to some
apostle, by whose preaching he became a changed man, and was saved by
the washing of regeneration,—so that where sin once abounded, grace did
much more abound. I am at a loss to know what answer they can give to
this who wish to maintain God’s righteousness by human conjectures, and,
knowing nothing of the depths of grace, have woven webs of improbable
fable.
