id="xviii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[VI.\]—The Purpose of the
Pelagians in Praising the Innocence of Conjugal Intercourse.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xi-p2"></span>Yet what it is they wish, what they
purpose, to what result they are striving to bring the matter, the words
that are added by that writer declare, when he asserts that I say, “that
therefore they who are born innocent are guilty, and that it is the work
of the devil, not of God, that they are born of this diabolical
intercourse.” Since, therefore, I neither say that this intercourse of
husband and wife is diabolical, especially in the case of believers,
which is effected for the sake of generating children who are afterwards
to be regenerated; nor that any men are made by the devil, but, in so
far as they are men, by God; and nevertheless that even of believing
husband and wife are born guilty persons (as if a wild olive were
produced from an olive), <span id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md) on
account of original sin, and on this account they are under the devil
unless they are born again in Christ, because the devil is the author of
the fault, not of the nature: what, on the other hand, are they
labouring to bring about who say that infants inherit no original sin,
and therefore are not under the devil, except that that grace of God in
infants may be made of no effect, by which He has plucked us out, as the
apostle says, from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the
kingdom of the Son of His love? <span
id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549.md) \[VII.\] When, indeed, they deny
that infants are in the power of darkness even before the help of the
Lord the deliverer, they are in such wise praising in them the Creator’s
work as to destroy the mercy of the Redeemer. And because I confess this
both in grown-up people and in infants, he says that this is without any
ambiguity Manicheism, although it is the most ancient catholic dogma by
which the new heretical dogma of these men is overturned.
