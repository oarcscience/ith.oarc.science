<span id="xiv.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—The Same Continued. The Monk
Pelagius. Grace is Conferred on the Unworthy.</span>

<span id="xiv.xl-p2"></span>His due reward, therefore, is recompensed to
the apostle as worthy of it; but still it was grace which bestowed on
him the apostleship itself, which was not his due, and of which he was
not worthy. Shall I be sorry for having said this? God forbid! For under
his own testimony shall I find a ready protection from such reproach;
nor will any man charge me with audacity, unless he be himself audacious
enough to charge the apostle with mendacity. He frankly says, nay he
protests, that he commends the gifts of God within himself, so that he
glories not in himself at all, but in the Lord; <span
id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719) he not only declares that he
possessed no good deserts in himself why he should be made an apostle,
but he even mentions his own demerits, in order to manifest and preach
the grace of God. “I am not meet,” says he, “to be called an
apostle;” <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720) and what else does
this mean than “I am not *worthy*”—as indeed several Latin copies read
the phrase. Now this, to be sure, is the very gist of our question; for
undoubtedly in this grace of apostleship all those graces are contained.
For it was neither convenient nor right that an apostle should not
possess the gift of *prophecy*, nor be a *teacher*, nor be illustrious
for *miracles* and *the gifts of healings*, nor furnish needful *helps*,
nor provide *governments* over the churches, nor excel in *diversities
of tongues.* All these functions the one name of apostleship embraces.
Let us, therefore, consult the man himself, nay listen wholly to him.
Let us say to him: “Holy Apostle Paul, the monk Pelagius declares that
thou wast worthy to receive all the graces of thine apostleship. What
dost thou say thyself?” He answers: “I am not worthy to be called an
apostle.” Shall I then, under pretence of honouring Paul, in a matter
concerning Paul, dare to believe Pelagius in preference to Paul? I will
<span id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span id="xiv.xl-Page_200"></span>not
do so; for if I did, I should only prove to be more onerous to myself
than honouring to him. <span id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721) Let us
hear also why he is not worthy to be called an apostle: “Because,” says
he, “I persecuted the Church of God.” <span
id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722) Now, were we to follow up the idea
here expressed, who would not judge that he rather deserved from Christ
condemnation, instead of an apostolic call? Who could so love the
preacher as not to loathe the persecutor? Well, therefore, and truly
does he say of himself: “I am not worthy to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the Church of God.” As thou wroughtest then such
evil, how camest thou to earn such good? Let all men hear his answer:
“But by the grace of God, I am what I am.” Is there, then, no other way
in which grace is commended, than because it is conferred on an unworthy
recipient? “And His grace,” he adds, “which was bestowed on me was not
in vain.” <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723) He says this as a
lesson to others also, to show the freedom of the will, when he says:
“We then, as workers together with Him, beseech you also that ye receive
not the grace of God in vain.” <span
id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724) Whence however does he derive his
proof, that “His grace bestowed on himself was not in vain,” except from
the fact which he goes on to mention: “But I laboured more abundantly
than they all?” <span id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725) So it seems
he did not labour in order to receive grace, but he received grace in
order that he might labour. And thus, when unworthy, he gratuitously
received grace, whereby he might become worthy to receive the due
reward. Not that he ventured to claim even his labour for himself; for,
after saying: “I laboured more abundantly than they all,” he at once
subjoined: “Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.” <span
id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726) O mighty teacher, confessor, and
preacher of grace! What meaneth this: “I laboured more, yet not I?”
Where the will exalted itself ever so little, there piety was instantly
on the watch, and humility trembled, because weakness recognised itself.
