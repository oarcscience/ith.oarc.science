<span id="x.v.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[VII.\]—The Error of Jovinianus
Did Not Extend So Far.</span>

<span id="x.v.xiii-p2"></span>A few years ago there lived at Rome one
Jovinian, <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) who is said to have
persuaded nuns of even advanced age to marry,—not, indeed, by seduction,
as if he wanted to make any of them his wife, but by contending that
virgins who dedicated themselves to the ascetic life had no more merit
before God than believing wives. It never entered his mind, however,
along with this conceit, to venture to affirm that children of men are
born without original sin. If, indeed, he had added such an opinion, the
women might have more readily consented to marry, to give birth to such
pure offspring. When this man’s writings (for he dared to write) were by
the brethren forwarded to Jerome to refute, he not only discovered no
such error in them, but, while looking out his conceits for refutation,
he found among other passages this very clear testimony to the doctrine
of man’s original sin, from which Jerome indeed felt satisfied of the
man’s belief of that doctrine. <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md)
These are his words when treating of it: “He who says that he abides in
Christ, ought himself also to walk even as He walked. <span
id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) We give our opponent the option to
choose which alternative he likes. Does he abide in Christ, or does he
not? If he does, then, let him walk like Christ. If, however, it is a
rash thing to undertake to resemble the excellences of Christ, he abides
not in Christ, because he walks not as Christ did. He did no sin,
neither was any guile found in His mouth; <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) who, when He was reviled, reviled not
again; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He opened not His
mouth; <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) to whom the prince of
this world came, and found nothing in Him; <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) whom, though He had done no sin, God
made sin for us. <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) We, however,
according to the Epistle of James, all commit many sins; <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) and none of us is pure from
uncleanness, even if his life should be but of one day. <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) For who shall boast that he has a
clean heart? Or who shall be confident that he is pure from sins? We are
held guilty according to the likeness of Adam’s transgression.
Accordingly David also says: ‘Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in
sin did my mother conceive me.’” <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md)

<span id="x.v.xiii-p3"></span> \[This “Christian Epicurus,” as he is
called by the intemperate zeal of the asceticism of his day, was
condemned as a heretic by councils at Rome and Milan in 390. According
to Jerome, who wrote a book against him, he not only opposed asceticism,
but also contended for the essential equality of all sins and of the
punishments and rewards of the next world, and for the sinlessness of
those baptized by the Spirit.—W.\]
