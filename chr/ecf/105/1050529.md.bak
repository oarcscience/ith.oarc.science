id="xv.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18 \[XVII.\]—The Condemnation of
Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xviii-p2"></span>This being the case, you of course feel
that episcopal councils, and the Apostolic See, and the whole Roman
Church, and the Roman Empire itself, <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942.md) which by God’s gracious favour has
become Christian, has been most righteously moved against the authors of
this wicked error, until they repent and escape from the snares of the
devil. For who can tell whether God may not give them repentance to
discover, and acknowledge, and even proclaim His truth, <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943.md) and to condemn their own damnable
error? But whatever may be the bent of their own will, we cannot doubt
that the merciful kindness of the Lord has sought the good of many
persons who followed them, for no other reason than because they saw
them associated in communion with the catholic Church.

<span id="xv.iv.xviii-p3"></span> Possidius, in his *Life of Augustin*,
ch. 18, says: “Even the most pious Emperor Honorius, upon hearing that
the weighty sentence of the catholic Church of God had been pronounced
against them, in pursuance of the same, determined that they should be
regarded as heretics, under condemnation by his own laws.” These
enactments are printed by the Benedictine editors in the second part of
their Appendix.
