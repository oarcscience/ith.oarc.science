<span id="x.iv.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36 \[XXII.\]—Man’s State Before the
Fall.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxxvi-p2"></span>Before they had thus violated their
obedience they were pleasing to God, and God was pleasing to them; and
though they carried about an animal body, they yet felt in it no
disobedience moving against themselves. This was the righteous
appointment, that inasmuch as their soul had received from the Lord the
body for its servant, as it itself obeyed the Lord, even so its body
should obey Him, and should exhibit a service suitable to the life given
it without resistance. Hence “they were both naked, and were not
ashamed.” <span id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) It is with a natural
instinct of shame that the rational soul is now indeed affected, because
in that flesh, over whose service it received the right of power, it can
no longer, owing to some indescribable infirmity, prevent the motion of
the members thereof, notwithstanding its own unwillingness, nor excite
them to motion even when it wishes. Now these members are on this
account, in every man of chastity, rightly called “*pudenda*,” <span
id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md) because they excite themselves, just
as they like, in opposition to the mind which is their master, as if
they were their own masters; and the sole authority which the bridle of
virtue possesses over them is to check them from approaching impure and
unlawful pollutions. Such disobedience of the flesh as this, which lies
in the very excitement, even when it is not allowed to take effect, did
not exist in the first man and woman whilst they were naked and not
ashamed. For not yet had the rational soul, which rules the flesh,
developed such a disobedience to its Lord, as by a reciprocity of
punishment to bring on itself the rebellion of its own servant the
flesh, along with that feeling of confusion and trouble to itself which
it certainly failed to inflict upon God by its own disobedience to Him;
for God is put to no shame or trouble when we do not obey Him, nor are
we able in any wise to lessen His very great power over us; but we are
shamed in that the flesh is not submissive to our government,—a result
which is brought about by the infirmity which we have earned by sinning,
and is called “the sin which dwelleth in our members.” <span
id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) But this sin is of such a character
that it is the punishment of sin. As soon, indeed, as that transgression
was effected, and the disobedient soul turned away from the law of its
Lord, then its servant, the body, began to cherish a law of disobedience
against it; and then the man and the woman grew ashamed of their
nakedness, when they perceived the rebellious motion of the flesh, which
they had not felt before, and which perception is called “the opening of
their eyes;”  <span id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) for, of course,
they did not walk about among the trees with closed eyes. The same thing
is said of Hagar: “Her eyes were opened, and she saw a well.” <span
id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md) Then the man and the woman covered
their parts of shame, which God had made for them as members, but they
had made parts of shame.
