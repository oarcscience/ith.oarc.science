<span id="xvi.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—The Devil the Author, Not of
Nature, But Only of Sin.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xii-p2"></span>Now, the man who forwarded to your Love
the paper in question has introduced the contents thereof with this
title: “In opposition to those persons who condemn matrimony, and
ascribe its fruits to the devil.” This, then, is not in opposition to
us, who neither condemn matrimony, which we even commend in its order
with a just commendation, nor ascribe its fruits to the devil. For the
fruits of matrimony are men which are orderly engendered from it, and
not the sins which accompany their birth. Human beings are not under the
devil’s dominion because they are human beings, in which respect they
are the fruits of matrimony; but because they are sinful, in which
resides the transmission of their sins. For the devil is the author of
sin, not of nature.
