<span id="xx.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—To a Sound Will is Committed the
Power of Persevering or of Not Persevering.</span>

<span id="xx.xl-p2"></span>As, therefore, the first man did not receive
this gift of God,—that is, perseverance in good, but it was left in his
choice to persevere or not to persevere, his will had such
strength,—inasmuch as it had been created without any sin, and there was
nothing in the way of concupiscence of himself that withstood it,—that
the choice of persevering could worthily be entrusted to such goodness
and to such facility in living well. But God at the same time foreknew
what he would do in unrighteousness; foreknew, however, but did not
compel him to this; but at the same time He knew what He Himself would
do in righteousness concerning him. But now, since that great freedom
has been lost by the desert of sin, our weakness has remained to be
aided by still greater gifts. For it pleased God, in order most
effectually to quench the pride of human presumption, “that no flesh
should glory in His presence”—that is, “no man.” <span
id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368.md) But whence should flesh not glory
in His presence, save concerning its merits? Which, indeed, it might
have had, but lost; and lost by that very means whereby it might have
had them, that is, by its free will; on account of which there remains
nothing to those who are to be delivered, save the grace of the
Deliverer. Thus, therefore, no flesh glories in His presence. For the
unrighteous do not glory, since they have no ground of glory; nor the
righteous, because they have a ground from Him, and have no glory of
theirs, but Himself, to whom they say, “My glory, and the lifter up of
my head.” <span id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369.md) And thus it is that
what is written pertains to every man, “that no flesh should glory in
His presence.” To the righteous, however, pertains that Scripture: “He
that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) For this the apostle most
manifestly showed, when, after saying “that no flesh should glory in His
presence,” lest the saints should suppose that they had been left
without any glory, he presently added, “But of Him are ye in Christ
Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is written, He
that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md) Hence it is that in this abode of
miseries, where trial is the life of man upon the earth, “strength is
made perfect in weakness.” <span id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md)
What strength, save “that he that glorieth should glory in the Lord”?
