<span id="xix.iv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Conjugal Chastity is Itself the
Gift of God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.viii-p2"></span>It is concerning conjugal chastity
itself that the apostle treats, when he says, “Let him do what he will,
he sinneth not if he marry;” <span id="fr_2999"></span>[3000](#fn_2999)
and yet this too is God’s gift, for the Scripture says, “It is by the
Lord that the woman is joined to her husband.” Accordingly the teacher
of the Gentiles, in one of his discourses, commends both conjugal
chastity, whereby adulteries are prevented, and the still more perfect
continence which foregoes all cohabitation, and shows how both one and
the other are severally the gift of God. Writing to the Corinthians, he
admonished married persons not to defraud each other; and then, after
his admonition to these, he added: “But I could wish that all men were
even as I am myself,” <span id="fr_3000"></span>[3001](#fn_3000)
—meaning, of course, that he abstained from all cohabitation; and then
proceeded to say: “But every man hath his own gift of God, one after
this manner, and another after that.” <span
id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001) Now, do the many precepts which are
written in the law of God, forbidding all fornication and adultery,
indicate anything else than free will? Surely such precepts would not be
given unless a man had a will of his own, wherewith to obey the divine
commandments. And yet it is God’s gift which is indispensable for the
observance of the precepts of chastity. Accordingly, it is said in the
Book of Wisdom: “When I knew that no one could be continent, except God
gives it, then this became a point of wisdom to know whose gift it
was.” <span id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002) “Every man,” however,
“is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed” <span
id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003) not to observe and keep these holy
precepts of chastity. If he should say in respect of these commandments,
“I wish to keep them, but am mastered by my concupiscence,” then the
Scripture responds to his free will, as I have already said: “Be not
overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” <span
id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004) In order, however, that this
victory may be gained, grace renders its help; and were not this help
given, then the law would be nothing but the strength of sin. For
concupiscence is increased and receives greater energies from the
prohibition of the law, unless the spirit of grace helps. This explains
the statement of the great Teacher of the Gentiles, when he says, “The
sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.” <span
id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005) See, then, I pray you, whence
originates this confession of weakness, when a man says, “I desire to
keep what the law commands, but am overcome by the strength of my
concupiscence.” And when his will is addressed, and it is said, “Be not
overcome of evil,” of what avail is anything but the succour of God’s
grace to the accomplishment of the precept? This the apostle himself
afterwards stated; for after saying “The strength of sin is the law,” he
immediately subjoined, “But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory,
through our Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006) It follows, then, that the victory
in which sin is vanquished is nothing else than the gift of God, who in
this contest helps free will.
