<span id="xxi.iii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—Augustin Claims the Right to
Grow in Knowledge.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxxii-p2"></span>Therefore it is in vain that it is
prescribed to me from that old book of mine, that I may not argue the
case as I ought to argue it in respect of infants; and that thence I may
not persuade my opponents by the light of a manifest truth, that God’s
grace is not given according to men’s merits. For if, when I began my
books con<span id="page_537">p. 537</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.xxxii-Page_537"></span>cerning Free Will as a layman, and
finished them as a presbyter, I still doubted of the condemnation of
infants not born again, and of the deliverance of infants that were born
again, no one, as I think, would be so unfair and envious as to hinder
my progress, and judge that I must continue in that uncertainty. But it
can more correctly be understood that it ought to be believed that I did
not doubt in that matter, for the reason that they against whom my
purpose was directed seemed to me in such wise to be rebutted, as that
whether there was a punishment of original sin in infants, according to
the truth, or whether there was not, as some mistaken people think, yet
in no degree should such a confusion of the two natures be believed in,
to wit, of good and evil, as the error of the Manicheans introduces. Be
it therefore far from us so to forsake the case of infants as to say to
ourselves that it is uncertain whether, being regenerated in Christ, if
they die in infancy they pass into eternal salvation; but that, not
being regenerated, they pass into the second death. Because that which
is written, “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,
and so death passed upon all men,” <span
id="fr_3619"></span>[3620](#fn_3619.md) cannot be rightly understood in any
other manner; nor from that eternal death which is most righteously
repaid to sin does any deliver any one, small or great, save He who, for
the sake of remitting our sins, both original and personal, died without
any sin of His own, either original or personal. But why some rather
than others? Again and again we say, and do not shrink from it, “O man,
who art thou that repliest against God?” <span
id="fr_3620"></span>[3621](#fn_3620.md) “His judgments are unsearchable,
and His ways past finding out.” <span
id="fr_3621"></span>[3622](#fn_3621.md) And let us add this, “Seek not out
the things that are too high for thee, and search not the things that
are above thy strength.” <span id="fr_3622"></span>[3623](#fn_3622.md)
