id="xvi.vi.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40 \[XXV.\]—Augustin Declines the
Dilemma Offered Him.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xli-p2"></span>“One of these propositions,” says he,
“is true, the other false.” My reply is as brief as the allegation: Both
are really true, neither is false. “It is true,” he goes on to say,
“that the sin of adultery cannot be excused by reason of the man who is
born of it; inasmuch as the sin which adulterers commit, pertains to
corruption of the will; but the offspring which they produce tends to
the praise of fecundity. If one were to sow wheat which had been stolen,
the crop which springs up is none the worse. Of course,” says he, “I
blame the thief, but I praise the corn. So I pronounce him innocent who
is born of the generous fruitfulness of the seed; even as the apostle
puts it: ‘God giveth it a body, as it pleases Him; and to every seed its
own body;’ <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280) but, at the same
time, I condemn the flagitious man who has committed his adulterous sin
in his perverse use of the divine appointment.”
