Admits the Need of Divine Help for Will and Action.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span>I also have read those books or
writings of his which he mentions in the letter which he sent to Pope
Innocent, of blessed memory, with the exception of a brief epistle which
he says he sent to the holy Bishop Constantius; but I have nowhere been
able to find in them that he acknowledges such a grace as helps not only
that “natural capacity of willing and acting” (which according to him we
possess, even when we neither will a good thing nor do it), but also the
will and the action itself, by the ministration of the Holy Ghost.
