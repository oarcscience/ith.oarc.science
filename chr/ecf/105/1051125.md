<span id="xxi.iii.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—Further Development of the
Foregoing Argument.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xlv-p2"></span>And in order that I may more openly
unfold this for the sake of those who are somewhat slow of apprehension,
let those who are endowed with an intelligence that flies in advance
bear with my delay. The Apostle James says, “If any of you lack wisdom,
let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not,
and it shall be given him.” <span id="fr_3663"></span>[3664](#fn_3663)
It is written also in the Proverbs of Solomon, “Because theLord giveth
wisdom.” <span id="fr_3664"></span>[3665](#fn_3664) And of continency it
is read in the book of Wisdom, whose authority has been used by great
and learned men who have commented upon the divine utterances long
before us; there, therefore, it is read, “When I knew that no one can be
continent unless God gives it, and that this was of wisdom, to know
whose gift this was.” <span id="fr_3665"></span>[3666](#fn_3665)
Therefore these are God’s gifts,—that is, to say nothing of others,
wisdom and continency. Let those also acquiesce: for they are not
Pelagians, to contend against such a manifest truth as this with hard
and heretical perversity. “But,” say they, “that these things are given
to us of God is obtained by faith, which has its beginning from us;” and
both to begin to have this faith, and to abide in it even to the end,
they contend is our own doing, as if we received it not from the Lord.
This, beyond a doubt, is in contradiction to the apostle when he says,
“For what hast thou that thou hast not received?” <span
id="fr_3666"></span>[3667](#fn_3666) It is in contradiction also to the
saying of the martyr Cyprian, “That we must boast in nothing, since
nothing is our own.” <span id="fr_3667"></span>[3668](#fn_3667) When we
have said this, and many other things which it is wearisome to repeat,
and have shown that both the commencement of faith and perseverance to
the end are gifts of God; and that it is impossible that God should not
foreknow any of His future gifts, as well what should be given as to
whom they should be given; and that thus those whom He delivers and
crowns are predestinated by Him; they think it well to reply, “that the
assertion of predestination is opposed to the advantage of preaching,
for the reason that when this is heard no one can be stirred up by the
incentives of rebuke.” When they say this, “they are unwilling that it
should be declared to men, that coming to the faith and abiding in the
faith are God’s gifts, lest despair rather than encouragement should
appear to be suggested, inasmuch as they who hear think that it is
uncertain to human ignorance on whom God bestows, or on whom He does not
bestow, these gifts.” Why, then, do they themselves also preach with us
that wisdom and continency are God’s gifts? But if, when these things
are declared to be God’s gifts, there is no hindrance of the exhortation
with which we exhort men to be wise and continent; what is after all the
reason for their thinking that the exhortation is hindered wherewith we
exhort men to come to the faith, and to abide in it to the end, if these
also are said to be God’s gifts, as is proved by the Scriptures, which
are His witnesses?
