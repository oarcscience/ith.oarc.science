<span id="xv.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[V.\]—Cœlestius’ Book Which Was
Produced in the Proceedings at Rome.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.v-p2"></span>But in the book which he published at Rome,
and produced in the proceedings before the church there, he so speaks on
this question as to show that he really believes what he had professed
to be in doubt about. For these are his words: <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md) “That infants, however, ought to be
baptized for the remission of sins, according to the rule of the Church
universal, and according to the meaning of the Gospel, we confess. For
the Lord has determined that the kingdom of heaven should only be
conferred on baptized persons; <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) and since the resources of nature
do not possess it, it must necessarily be conferred by the gift of
grace.” Now if he had not said anything elsewhere on this subject, who
would not have supposed that he acknowledged the remission of original
sin even in infants at their baptism, by saying that they ought to be
baptized for the remission of sins? Hence the point of what you have
stated in your letter, that Pelagius’ answer to you was on this wise,
“That infants are baptized with the same words of sacramental formula as
adults,” and that you were rejoiced to hear the very thing which you
were desirous of hearing, <span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="xv.iv.v-Page_238"></span>and yet that you preferred holding a
consultation with us concerning his words.
