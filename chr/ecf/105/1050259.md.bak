id="xii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[XI.\]—In Our Discussions About
Grace, We Do Not Speak of that Which Relates to the Constitution of Our
Nature, But to Its Restoration.</span>

<span id="xii.xvi-p2"></span>I confess to your love, that when I read
those words I was filled with a sudden joy, because he did not deny the
grace of God by which alone a man can be justified; for it is this which
I mainly detest and dread in discussions of this kind. But when I went
on to read the rest, I began to have my suspicions, first of all, from
the similes he employs. For he says: “If I were to say, man is able to
dispute; a bird is able to fly; a hare is able to run; without
mentioning at the same time the instruments by which these acts can be
accomplished—that is, the tongue, the wings, and the legs; should I then
have denied the conditions of the various offices, when I acknowledged
the very offices themselves?” It is at once apparent that he has here
instanced such things as are by nature efficient; for the members of the
bodily structure which are here mentioned are created with natures of
such a kind—the tongue, the wings, the legs. He has not here posited any
such thing as we wish to have understood by *grace*, without which no
man is justified; for this is a topic which is concerned about the cure,
not the constitution, of natural functions. Entertaining, then, some
apprehensions, I proceeded to read all the rest, and I soon found that
my suspicions had not been unfounded.
