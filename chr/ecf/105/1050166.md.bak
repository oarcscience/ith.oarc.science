<span id="x.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[IX.\]—Christians Do Not Always
Beget Christian, Nor the Pure, Pure Children.</span>

<span id="x.v.xvii-p2"></span>With these and such like palpable
arguments, should I endeavour, as I best could, to convince those
persons who believed that sacraments of cleansing were superfluously
applied to the children of the cleansed, how right is the judgment of
baptizing the infants of baptized parents, and how it may happen that to
a man who has within him the twofold seed—of death in the flesh, and of
immortality in the spirit—that may prove no obstacle, regenerated as he
is by the Spirit, which is an obstacle to his son, who is generated by
the flesh; and that that may be cleansed in the one by remission, which
in the other still requires cleansing by like remission, just as in the
case supposed of circumcision, and as in the case of the winnowing and
thrashing. But now, when we are contending with those who allow that the
children of the baptized ought to be baptized, we may much more
conveniently conduct our discussion, and can say: You who assert that
the children of such persons as have been cleansed from the pollution of
sin ought to have been born without sin, why do you not perceive that by
the same rule you might just as well say that the children of Christian
parents ought to have been born Christians? Why, therefore, do you
rather maintain that they ought to become Christians? Was there not in
their parents, to whom it is said, “Know ye not that your bodies are the
members of Christ?” <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) a Christian
body? Perhaps you suppose that a Christian body may be born of Christian
parents, without having received a Christian soul? Well, this would
render the case much more wonderful still. For you would think of the
soul one of two things as you pleased,—because, of course, you hold with
the apostle, that before birth it had done nothing good or evil: <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) —either that it was derived by
transmission, and just as the body of Christians is Christian, so should
also their soul be Christian; or else that it was created by Christ,
either in the Christian body, or for the sake of the Christian body, and
it ought therefore to have been created or given in a Christian
condition. Unless perchance you shall pretend that, although Christian
parents had it in their power to beget a Christian body, yet Christ
Himself was not able to produce a Christian soul. Believe then the
truth, and see that, as it has been possible (as you yourselves admit)
for one who is not a Christian to be born of Christian parents, for one
who is not a member of Christ to be born of members of Christ, and (that
we may answer all, who, however falsely, are yet in some sense possessed
with a sense of religion) for a man who is not consecrated to be born of
parents who are consecrated; so also it is quite possible for one who is
not cleansed to be born of parents who are cleansed. Now what account
will you give us, of why from Christian parents is born one who is not a
Christian, unless it be that not generation, but regeneration makes
Christians? Resolve therefore your own question with a like reason, that
cleansing from sin comes to no one by being born, but to all by being
born again. And thus any child who is born of parents who are cleansed,
because born again, must himself be born again, in order that he too may
be cleansed. For it has been quite possible for parents to transmit to
their children that which they did not possess themselves,—thus
resembling not only the wheat which yielded the chaff, and the
circumcised the foreskin, but also the <span id="page_76">p. 76</span>
<span id="x.v.xvii-Page_76"></span>instance which you yourselves adduce,
even that of believers who convey unbelief to their posterity; which,
however, does not accrue to the faithful as regenerated by the Spirit,
but it is owing to the fault of the mortal seed by which they have been
born of the flesh. For in respect of the infants whom you judge it
necessary to make believers by the sacrament of the faithful you do not
deny that they were born in unbelief although of believing parents.
