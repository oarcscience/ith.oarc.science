<span id="xii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18 \[XVII.\]—Who May Be Said to Be in
the Flesh.</span>

<span id="xii.xxii-p2"></span>There is a passage which nobody could
place against these texts with the similar purpose of showing the
impossibility of not sinning: “The wisdom of the flesh is enmity against
God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed <span
id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span id="xii.xxii-Page_127"></span>can be;
so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God;” <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170) for he here mentions the wisdom of
the flesh, not the wisdom which cometh from above: moreover, it is
manifest, that in this passage, by the phrase, “being in the flesh,” are
signified, not those who have not yet quitted the body, but those who
live according to the flesh. The question, however, we are discussing
does not lie in this point. But what I want to hear from him, if I can,
is about those who live according to the Spirit, and who on this account
are not, in a certain sense, in the flesh, even while they still live
here,—whether they, by God’s grace, live according to the Spirit, or are
sufficient for themselves, natural capability having been bestowed on
them when they were created, and their own proper will besides. Whereas
the fulfilling of the law is nothing else than love; <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171) and God’s love is shed abroad in
our hearts, not by our own selves, but by the Holy Ghost which is given
to us. <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172)
