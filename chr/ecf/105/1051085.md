<span id="xxi.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—God is Besought for It, Because It
is His Gift.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.v-p2"></span>But why is that perseverance asked for
from God if it is not given by God? Is that, too, a mocking petition,
when that is asked from Him which it is known that He does not give,
but, though He gives it not, is in man’s power; just as that giving of
thanks is a mockery, if thanks are given to God for that which He did
not give nor do? But what I have said there, <span
id="fr_3564"></span>[3565](#fn_3564.md) I say also here again: “Be not
deceived,” says the apostle, “God is not mocked.” <span
id="fr_3565"></span>[3566](#fn_3565.md) O man, God is a witness not only of
your words, but also of your thoughts. If you ask anything in truth and
faith of one who is so rich, believe that you receive from Him from whom
you ask, what you ask. Abstain from honouring Him with your lips and
extolling yourself over Him in your heart, by believing that you have
from yourself what you are pretending to beseech from Him. Is not this
perseverance, perchance, asked for from Him? He who says this is not to
be rebuked by any arguments, but must be overwhelmed <span
id="fr_3566"></span>[3567](#fn_3566.md) with the prayers of the saints. Is
there any of these who does not ask for himself from God that he may
persevere in Him, when in that very prayer which is called the
Lord’s—because the Lord taught it—when it is prayed by the saints,
scarcely anything else is understood to be prayed for but perseverance?
