<span id="xii.lxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 57 \[XLIX.\]—It Does Not Detract from
God’s Almighty Power, that He is Incapable of Either Sinning, or Dying,
or Destroying Himself.</span>

<span id="xii.lxi-p2"></span>“Inasmuch,” says he, “as not to sin is
ours, we are able to sin and to avoid sin.” What, then, if another
should say: “Inasmuch as not to wish for unhappiness is ours, we are
able both to wish for it and not to wish for it?” And yet we are
positively unable to wish for it. For who could possibly wish to be
unhappy, even though he wishes for something else from which unhappiness
will ensue to him against his will? Then again, inasmuch as, in an
infinitely greater degree, it is God’s not to sin, shall we therefore
venture to say that He is able both to sin and to avoid sin? God forbid
that we should ever say that He is able to sin! For He cannot, as
foolish persons suppose, therefore fail to be almighty, because He is
unable to die, or because He cannot deny Himself. What, therefore, does
he mean? by what method of speech does he try to persuade us on a point
which he is himself loth to consider? For he advances a step further,
and says: “Inasmuch as, however, it is not of us to be able to avoid
sin; even if we were to wish not to be able to avoid sin, it is not in
our power to be unable to avoid sin.” It is an involved sentence, and
therefore a very obscure one. It might, however, be more plainly
expressed in some such way as this: “Inasmuch as to be able to avoid sin
is not of us, then, whether we wish it or do not wish it, we are able to
avoid sin!” He does not say, “Whether we wish it or do not wish it, we
do not sin,”—for we undoubtedly do sin, if we wish;—but yet he asserts
that, whether we will or not, we have the capacity of not sinning,—a
capacity which <span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span
id="xii.lxi-Page_141"></span>he declares to be inherent in our nature.
Of a man, indeed, who has his legs strong and sound, it may be said
admissibly enough, “whether he will or not he has the capacity of
walking;” but if his legs be broken, however much he may wish, he has
not the capacity. The nature of which our author speaks is corrupted.
“Why is dust and ashes proud?”  <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261) It is corrupted. It implores the
Physician’s help. “Save me, O Lord,” <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262) is its cry; “Heal my soul,” <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263) it exclaims. Why does he check such
cries so as to hinder future health, by insisting, as it were, on its
present capacity?
