<span id="xvii.vi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18 \[XII.\]—His Tenth Error. (See
Above in Book I. 13 \[XI.\] and Book II. 15 \[XI.\]).</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.xviii-p2"></span>Again, if you wish to be a catholic,
I pray you, neither believe, nor say, nor teach that “the sacrifice of
Christians ought to be offered in behalf of those who have departed out
of the body without having been baptized.” Because you fail to show that
the sacrifice of the Jews, which you have quoted out of the books of the
Maccabees, <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md) was offered in
behalf of any who had departed this life without circumcision. In this
novel opinion of yours, which you have advanced against the authority
and teaching of the whole Church, you have used a very arrogant mode of
expression. You say, “In behalf of these, I most certainly decide that
constant oblations and incessant sacrifices must be offered up on the
part of the holy priests.” Here you show, as a layman, no submission to
God’s priests for instruction; nor do you associate yourself with them
(the least you could do) for inquiry; but you put yourself before them
by your proud assumption of judgment. Away, my son, with all this
pretension; men walk not so arrogantly in the Way, which the Humble
Christ taught that He Himself is. <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) No man enters through His narrow
gate with so proud a disposition as this.
