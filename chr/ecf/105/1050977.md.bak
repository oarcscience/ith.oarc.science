<span id="xix.iv.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—God Operates on Men’s Hearts
to Incline Their Wills Whithersoever He Pleases.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xliii-p2"></span>From these statements of the inspired
word, and from similar passages which it would take too long to quote in
full, it is, I think, sufficiently clear that God works in the hearts of
men to incline their wills whithersoever He wills, whether to good deeds
according to His mercy, or to evil after their own deserts; His own
judgment being sometimes manifest, sometimes secret, but always
righteous. This ought to be the fixed and immoveable conviction of your
heart, that there is no unrighteousness with God. Therefore, whenever
you read in the Scriptures of Truth, that men are led aside, or that
their hearts are blunted and hardened by God, never doubt that some ill
deserts of their own have first occurred, so that they justly suffer
these things. Thus you will not run counter to that proverb of Solomon:
“The foolishness of a man perverteth his ways, yet he blameth God in his
heart.” <span id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211.md) Grace, however, is
not bestowed according to men’s deserts; otherwise grace would be no
longer grace. <span id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212.md) For grace is so
designated because it is given gratuitously. <span
id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213.md) Now if God is able, either through
the agency of angels (whether good ones or evil), or in any other way
whatever, to operate in the hearts even of the wicked, in return for
their deserts,—whose wickedness was not made by Him, but was either
derived originally from Adam, or increased by their own will,—what is
there to wonder at if, through the Holy Spirit, He works good in the
hearts of the elect, who has wrought it that their hearts become good
instead of evil?
