<span id="xviii.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—That the Apostle is Speaking
in His Own Person and that of Others Who Are Under Grace, Not Still
Under Law.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xiv-p2"></span>And from this point he now
begins—and, it was on account of this that I undertook the consideration
of these things—to introduce his own person, and to speak as if about
himself; where the Pelagians will not have it that the apostle himself
is to be understood, but say that he has transfigured another person
into himself,—that is, a man placed still under the law, not yet freed
by grace. And here, indeed, they ought at least to concede that “in the
law no one is justified,” as the same apostle says elsewhere; but that
the law avails for the knowledge of sin, and for the transgression of
the law itself, so that sin, being known and increased, grace may be
sought for through faith. But they do not fear that those things should
be understood concerning the apostle which he might also say concerning
his past, but they fear those things which follow. For here he says: “I
had not known lust if the law had not said, Thou shall not covet. But
the occasion being taken, sin wrought in me by the commandment all
manner of lust. For without the law sin was dead. But I was alive
without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I
died, and the commandment which was for life was found for me to be
death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by
it slew me. Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy,
just, and good. Was, then, that which is good made death unto me? By no
means. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death to me by that
which is good, that the sinner or the sin might become by the
commandment excessive.” All these things, as I have said, the apostle
can seem to have commemorated from his past life: so that from what he
says, “For I was alive without the law once,” he may have wished his
first age from infancy to be understood, before the years of reason; but
in that he added, “But when the commandment came, sin revived, but I
died,” he would fain show himself able to receive the commandment, but
not to do it, and therefore a transgressor of the law.
