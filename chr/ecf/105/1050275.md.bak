id="xii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XXV.\]—The Disposition of Nearly
All Who Go Astray. With Some Heretics Our Business Ought Not to Be
Disputation, But Prayer.</span>

<span id="xii.xxxii-p2"></span>Man’s proud mind has no relish at all for
this; God, however, is great, in persuading even it how to find it all
out. We are, indeed, more inclined to seek how best to reply to such
arguments as oppose our error, than to experience how salutary would be
our condition if we were free from error. We ought, therefore, to
encounter all such, not by discussions, but rather by prayers both for
them and for ourselves. For we never say to them, what this opponent has
opposed to himself, that “sin was necessary in order that there might be
a cause for God’s mercy.” Would there had never been misery to render
that mercy necessary! But the iniquity of sin,—which is so much the
greater in proportion to the ease wherewith man might have avoided sin,
whilst no infirmity did as yet beset him,—has been followed closely up
by a most righteous punishment; even that \[offending man\] should
receive in himself a reward in kind of his sin, losing that obedience of
his body which had been in some degree put under his own control, which
he had despised when it <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="xii.xxxii-Page_131"></span>was the right of his Lord. And, inasmuch
as we are now born with the self-same law of sin, which in our members
resists the law of our mind, we ought never to murmur against God, nor
to dispute in opposition to the clearest fact, but to seek and pray for
His mercy instead of our punishment.
