id="xxi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—To What Extent the
Massilians <span id="fr_3415"></span>[3416](#fn_3415.md) Withdraw from the
Pelagians.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.ii-p3"></span>For on consideration of your letters, I
seem to see that those brethren on whose behalf you exhibit a pious care
that they may not hold the poetical opinion in which it is affirmed,
“Every one is a hope for himself,” <span
id="fr_3416"></span>[3417](#fn_3416.md) and so fall under that condemnation
which is, not poetically, but prophetically, declared, “Cursed is every
man that hath hope in man,” <span id="fr_3417"></span>[3418](#fn_3417.md)
must be treated in that way wherein the apostle dealt with those to whom
he said, “And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal
even this unto you.” <span id="fr_3418"></span>[3419](#fn_3418.md) For as
yet they are in darkness on the question concerning the predestination
of the saints, but they have that whence, “if in anything they are
otherwise minded, God will reveal even this unto them,” if they are
walking in that to which they have attained. For which reason the
apostle, when he had said, “If ye are in anything otherwise minded, God
shall reveal even this unto you,” says, “Nevertheless whereunto we have
attained, let us walk in the same.”  <span
id="fr_3419"></span>[3420](#fn_3419.md) And those brethren of ours, on
whose behalf your pious love is solicitous, have attained with Christ’s
Church to the belief that the human race is born obnoxious to the sin of
the first man, and that none can be delivered from that evil save by the
righteousness of the Second Man. Moreover, they have attained to the
confession that men’s wills are anticipated by God’s grace; and to the
agreement that no one can suffice to himself either for beginning or for
completing any good work. These things, therefore, unto which they have
attained, being held fast, abundantly distinguish them from the error of
the Pelagians. Further, if they walk in them, and beseech Him who giveth
understanding, if in anything concerning predestination they are
otherwise minded, He will reveal even this unto them. Yet let us also
spend upon them the influence of our love, and the ministry of our <span
id="page_499">p. 499</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.ii-Page_499"></span>discourse, according to His gift, whom we
have asked that in these letters we might say what should be
suitable <span id="fr_3420"></span>[3421](#fn_3420.md) and profitable to
them. For whence do we know whether by this our service, wherein we are
serving them in the free love of Christ, our God may not perchance will
to effect that purpose?

opposing had its chief centre in Marseilles, and hence is called
“Massilians.” Prosper in his letter called them *reliquiæ Pelagianorum*,
i.e., “the remnants of the Pelagians.” They are now most commonly called
“Semi-Pelagians.”—W.\]
