<span id="xiii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—(37.) The Sixth Passage.</span>

<span id="xiii.xli-p2"></span>He has also adduced this passage of
Scripture, which is very commonly quoted against his party: “For there
is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.” <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) And he makes a pretence of
answering it by other passages,—how, “the Lord says concerning holy Job,
‘Hast thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him upon
earth, a man who is blameless, true, a worshipper of God, and abstaining
from every evil thing.’” <span id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) On
this passage we have already made some remarks. <span
id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) But he has not even attempted to
show us how, on the one <span id="page_173">p. 173</span> <span
id="xiii.xli-Page_173"></span>hand, Job was absolutely sinless upon
earth,—if the words are to bear such a sense; and, on the other hand,
how that can be true which he has admitted to be in the Scripture,
“There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth
not.” <span id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md)
