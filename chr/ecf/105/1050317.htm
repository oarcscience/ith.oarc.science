<p class="c46"><a name="xii.lxxiv-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xii.lxxiv-p1.1"></A>Chapter 70 [LX.]&#8212;Whether Any Man is Without Sin in This Life.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xii.lxxiv-p2"></A>Now, whether there ever has been, or is, or ever can be, a man living so righteous a life in this world as to have no sin at all, may be an open question among true and pious Christians;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1301"></A><A HREF="#fn_1301"><FONT SIZE="1">1302</FONT></A>
 but whoever doubts the possibility of this sinless state <i>after this present life</i>; is foolish. For my own part, indeed, I am unwilling to dispute the point even as respects this life. For <A NAME="page_146"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 146</FONT></A> <a name="xii.lxxiv-Page_146"></A>although that passage seems to me to be incapable of bearing any doubtful sense, wherein it is written, &#8220;In thy sight shall no man living be justified&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1302"></A><A HREF="#fn_1302"><FONT SIZE="1">1303</FONT></A>
 (and so of similar passages), yet I could wish it were possible to show either that such quotations were capable of bearing a better signification, or that a perfect and plenary righteousness, to which it were impossible for any accession to be made, had been realized at some former time in some one whilst passing through this life in the flesh, or was now being realized, or would be hereafter. They, however, are in a great majority, who, while not doubting that to the last day of their life it will be needful to them to resort to the prayer which they can so truthfully utter, &#8220;Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1303"></A><A HREF="#fn_1303"><FONT SIZE="1">1304</FONT></A>
 still trust that in Christ and His promises they possess a true, certain, and unfailing hope. There is, however, no method whereby any persons arrive at absolute perfection, or whereby any man makes the slightest progress to true and godly righteousness, but the assisting grace of our crucified Saviour Christ, and the gift of His Spirit; and whosoever shall deny this cannot rightly, I almost think, be reckoned in the number of any kind of Christians at all.</p>
