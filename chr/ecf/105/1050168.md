id="x.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[XI.\]—Sin and Death in Adam,
Righteousness and Life in Christ.</span>

<span id="x.v.xix-p2"></span>What the apostle says: “By one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin; and so it passed upon all men,
in which all have sinned;” <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691) we
must, however, for the present so accept as not to seem rashly and
foolishly to oppose the many great passages of Holy Scripture, which
teach us that no man can obtain eternal life without that union with
Christ which is effected in Him and with Him, when we are imbued with
His sacraments and incorporated with the members of His body. Now this
statement which the apostle addresses to the Romans, “By one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin; and so it passed upon all men,
in which all have sinned,” tallies in sense with his words to the
Corinthians: “Since by man came death, by Man came also the resurrection
of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive.” <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692) For nobody doubts that
the subject here referred to is the death of the body, because the
apostle was with much earnestness dwelling on the resurrection of the
body; and he seems to be silent here about sin for this reason, namely,
because the question was not about righteousness. Both points are
mentioned in the Epistle to the Romans, and both points are, at very
great length, insisted on by the apostle,—sin in Adam, righteousness in
Christ; and death in Adam, life in Christ. However, as I have observed
already, I have thoroughly examined and opened, in the first book of
this treatise, all these words of the apostle’s argument, as far as I
was able, and as much as seemed necessary.
