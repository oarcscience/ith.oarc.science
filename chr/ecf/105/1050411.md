<span id="xiv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—The Accusations in the Seventh
Item, Which Pelagius Confessed.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxx-p2"></span>Let us now see what were the two points out
of all that were alleged which Pelagius was unwilling to anathematize,
and admitted to be his own opinions, but to remove their offensive
aspect explained in what sense he held them. “That a man,” says he, “is
able to be without sin has been asserted already.” Asserted no doubt,
and we remember the assertion quite well; but still it was mitigated,
and approved by the judges, in that God’s grace was added, concerning
which nothing was said in the original draft of his doctrine. Touching
the second, however, of these points, we ought to pay careful attention
to what he said in answer to the charge against him. “Concerning the
fact, indeed,” says he, “that before the Lord’s coming there were
persons without sin, we now again assert that previous to Christ’s
advent some men lived holy and righteous lives, according to the
teaching of the sacred Scriptures.” He did not dare to say: “We now
again assert that previous to Christ’s advent there were persons without
sin,” although this had been laid to his charge after the very words of
Cœlestius. For he perceived how dangerous such a statement was, and into
what trouble it would bring him. So he reduced the sentence to these
harmless dimensions: “We again assert that before the coming of Christ
there were persons who led holy and righteous lives.” Of course there
were: who would deny it? But to say this is a very different thing from
saying that they lived “without sin.” Because, indeed, those ancient
worthies lived holy and righteous lives, they could for that very reason
better confess: “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in <span id="page_195">p. 195</span> <span
id="xiv.xxx-Page_195"></span>us.” <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680) In the present day, also, many men
live holy and righteous lives; but yet it is no untruth they utter when
in their prayer they say: “Forgive us our debts, even as we forgive our
debtors.” <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681) This avowal was
accordingly acceptable to the judges, in the sense in which Pelagius
solemnly declared his belief; but certainly not in the sense which
Cœlestius, according to the original charge against him, was said to
hold. We must now treat in detail of the topics which still remain, to
the best of our ability.
