<span id="xviii.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[IV.\]—What Was Done in the Case
of Cœlestius and Zosimus.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.vi-p2"></span>But what need is there for us to delay
longer in speaking of this matter, when there are extant here and there
proceedings and writings drawn up, where all those things just as they
were <span id="page_394">p. 394</span> <span
id="xviii.iv.vi-Page_394"></span>transacted may be either learnt or
recalled? For who does not see in what degree Cœlestius was bound by the
interrogations of your holy predecessor and by the answers of Cœlestius,
whereby he professed that he consented to the letters of Pope Innocent,
and fastened by a most wholesome chain, so as not to dare any further to
maintain that the original sin of infants is not put away in baptism?
Because these are the words of the venerable Bishop Innocent concerning
this matter to the Carthaginian Council: “For once,” he said, “he bore
free will; but, using his advantage inconsiderately, and falling into
the depths of apostasy, he was overwhelmed, and found no way whereby he
could rise from thence; and, deceived for ever by his liberty, he would
have lain under the oppression of this ruin, if the advent of Christ had
not subsequently for his grace delivered him, and, by the purification
of a new regeneration, purged all past sin by the washing of His
baptism.” <span id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629.md) What could be more
clear or more manifest than that judgment of the Apostolical See? To
this Cœlestius professed that he assented, when it was said to him by
your holy predecessor, “Do you condemn all those things that are bandied
about under your name?” and he himself replied, “I condemn them in
accordance with the judgment of your predecessor Innocent, of blessed
memory.” But among other things which had been uttered under his name,
the deacon Paulinus had objected to Cœlestius that he said “that the sin
of Adam was prejudicial to himself alone, and not to the human race, and
that infants newly born were in the same condition in which Adam was
before his sin.” <span id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630.md) Accordingly,
if he would condemn the views objected to by Paulinus with a truthful
heart and tongue, according to the judgment of the blessed Pope
Innocent, what could remain to him afterwards whence he could contend
that there was no sin in infants resulting from the past transgression
of the first man, which would be purged in holy baptism by the
purification of the new regeneration? But he showed that he had answered
deceitfully by the final event, when he withdrew himself from the
examination, lest he should be compelled, according to the African
rescripts, absolutely to mention and anathematize the very words
themselves concerning this question which he wrote in his tractate.
