<span id="xiii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>(35.) The Church Will Be Without Spot and
Wrinkle After the Resurrection.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxxix-p2"></span>Then shall the Church realize, fully and
perfectly, the condition of “not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing,” <span id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) because then also
will it in a real sense be glorious. For inasmuch as he added the
epithet “glorious,” when he said, “That He might present the Church to
Himself, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,” he signified
sufficiently when the Church will be without spot, or wrinkle, or
anything of this kind,—then of course when it shall be glorious. Because
it is not so much when the Church is involved in so many evils, or
amidst such offences, and in so great a mixture of very evil men, and
amidst the heavy reproaches of the ungodly, that we ought to say that it
is glorious, because kings serve it,—a fact which only produces a more
perilous and a sorer temptation;—but then shall it rather be glorious,
when that event shall come to pass of which the apostle also speaks in
the words, “When Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall ye
also appear with Him in glory.” <span
id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md) For since the Lord Himself, in that
form of a servant by which He united Himself as Mediator to the Church,
was not glorified except by the glory of His resurrection (whence it is
said, “The Spirit was not yet given, because Christ was not yet
glorified” <span id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532) .md), how shall His
Church be described as *glorious*, before its resurrection? He cleanses
it, therefore, now “by the laver of the water in the word,” <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) washing away its past sins, and
driving off from it the dominion of wicked angels; but then by bringing
all its healthy powers to perfection, He makes it meet for that glorious
state, where it shall shine without a spot or wrinkle. For “whom He did
predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also
justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.” <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) It was under this mystery, as I
suppose, that that was spoken, “Behold, I cast out devils, and I do
cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be consummated,”
or perfected. <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) For He said
this in the person of His body, which is His Church, putting *days* for
distinct and appointed periods, which He also signified in “the third
day” in His resurrection.
