<span id="xviii.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Free Choice Did Not Perish With
Adam ’s Sin. What Freedom Did Perish.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.v-p2"></span>But in defending free will they hasten
to confide rather in it for doing righteousness than in God’s aid, and
to glory every one in himself, and not in the Lord. <span
id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527.md) But who of us will say that by the
sin of the first man free will perished from the human race? Through sin
freedom indeed perished, but it was that freedom which was in Paradise,
to have a full righteousness with immortality; and it is on this account
that human nature needs divine grace, since the Lord says, “If the Son
shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed” <span
id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528.md) —free of course to live well and
righteously. For free will in the sinner up to this extent did not
perish,—that by it all sin, especially they who sin with delight and
with love of sin; what they are pleased to do gives them pleasure.
Whence also the apostle says, “When ye were the servants of sin, ye were
free from righteousness.” <span id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529.md)
Behold, they are shown to have been by no means able to serve sin except
by another freedom. They are not, then, free from righteousness except
by the choice of the will, but they do not become free from sin save by
the grace of the Saviour. For which reason the admirable Teacher also
distinguished these very words: “For when ye were the servants,” says
he, “of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye, then,
in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things
is death. But now being freed from sin and become servants to God, ye
have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.” <span
id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530.md) He called them “free” from
righteousness, not “freed;” but from sin not “free,” lest they should
attribute this to themselves, but most watchfully he preferred to say
“freed,” referring this to that declaration of the Lord, “If the Son
shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed.” <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531.md) Since, then, the sons of men do not
live well unless they are made the sons of God, why is it that this
writer wishes to give the power of good living to free will, when this
power is not given save by God’s grace through Jesus Christ our Lord, as
the gospel says: “And as many as re<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>
<span id="xviii.iii.v-Page_379"></span>ceived Him, to them gave He power
to become the sons of God”? <span id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532.md)
