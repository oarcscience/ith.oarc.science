<span id="xv.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14 \[XII.\]—The Righteousness Which
is of God, and the Righteousness Which is of the Law.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xiv-p2"></span>If this grace is to be called
“teaching,” let it at any rate be so called in such wise that God may be
believed to infuse it, along with an ineffable sweetness, more deeply
and more internally, not only by *their* agency who plant and water from
without, but likewise by His own too who ministers in secret His own
increase,—in such a way, that He not only exhibits truth, but likewise
imparts love. For it is thus that God teaches those who have been called
according to His purpose, giving them simultaneously both to know what
they ought to do, and to do what they know. Accordingly, the apostle
thus speaks to the Thessalonians: “As touching love of the brethren, ye
need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to
love one another.” <span id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) And then,
by way of proving that they had been taught of God, he subjoined: “And
indeed ye do it towards all the brethren which are in all
Macedonia.” <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) As if the surest
sign that you have been taught of God, is that you put into practice
what you have been taught. Of that character are all who are called
accord<span id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span
id="xv.iii.xiv-Page_222"></span>ing to God’s purpose, as it is written
in the prophets: “They shall be all taught of God.” <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) The man, however, who has learned
what ought to be done, but does it not, has not as yet been “taught of
God” according to grace, but only according to the law,—not according to
the spirit, but only according to the letter. Although there are many
who appear to do what the law commands, through fear of punishment, not
through love of righteousness; and such righteousness as this the
apostle calls “his own which is after the law,”—a thing as it were
commanded, not given. When, indeed, it has been given, it is not called
our own righteousness, but God’s; because it becomes our own only so
that we have it from God. These are the apostle’s words: “That I may be
found in Him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but
that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of
God by faith.” <span id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) So great,
then, is the difference between the law and grace, that although the law
is undoubtedly of God, yet the righteousness which is “of the law” is
not “of God,” but the righteousness which is consummated by grace is “of
God.” The one is designated “the righteousness of the law,” because it
is done through fear of the curse of the law; while the other is called
“the righteousness of God,” because it is bestowed through the
beneficence of His grace, so that it is not a terrible but a pleasant
commandment, according to the prayer in the psalm: “Good art Thou, O
Lord, therefore in Thy goodness teach me Thy righteousness;” <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817.md) that is, that I may not be
compelled like a slave to live under the law with fear of punishment;
but rather in the freedom of love may be delighted to live with law as
my companion. When the freeman keeps a commandment, he does it readily.
And whosoever learns his duty in this spirit, does everything that he
has learned ought to be done.
