<span id="xvi.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22 \[XX.\]—Even Infants, When
Unbaptized, are in the Power of the Devil; Exorcism in the Case of
Infants, and Renunciation of the Devil.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxii-p2"></span>Now the Christian faith unfalteringly
declares, what our new heretics have begun to deny, both that they who
are cleansed in the laver of regeneration are redeemed from the power of
the devil, and that those who have not yet been redeemed by such
regeneration are still captive in the power of the devil, even if they
be infant children of the redeemed, unless they be themselves redeemed
by the self-same grace of Christ. For we cannot doubt that that blessing
of God applies to every stage of human life, which the apostle describes
when he says concerning Him: “Who hath delivered us from the power of
darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear
Son.” <span id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) From this power of
darkness, therefore, of which the devil is the prince,—in other words,
from the power of the devil and his angels,—infants are delivered when
they are baptized; and whosoever denies this, is convicted by the truth
of the Church’s very sacraments, which no heretical novelty in the
Church of Christ is permitted to destroy or change, so long as the
Divine Head rules and helps the entire body which He owns—small as well
as great. It is true, then, and in no way false, that the devil’s power
is exorcised in infants, and that they renounce him by the hearts and
mouths of those who bring them to baptism, being unable to do so by
their own; in order that they may be delivered from the power of
darkness, and be translated into the kingdom of their Lord. What is
that, therefore, within them which keeps them in the power of the devil
until they are delivered from it by Christ’s sacrament of baptism? What
is it, I ask, but sin? Nothing else, indeed, has the devil found which
enables him to put under his own control that nature of man which the
good Creator made good. But infants have committed no sin of their own
since they have been alive. Only original sin, therefore, remains,
whereby they are made captive under the devil’s power, until they are
redeemed therefrom by the laver of regeneration and the blood of Christ,
and pass into their Redeemer’s kingdom,—the power of their enthraller
being frustrated, and power being given them to become “sons of God”
instead of children of this world. <span
