<span id="xviii.v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Perfection of Righteousness
and Full Security Was Not Even in Paul in This Life.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xviii-p2"></span>But how impudent I do not say, but
how insane, is the pride which, not yet being equal to the angels of
God, thinks itself already able to have a righteousness equal to the
angels of God; and does not consider so great and holy a man, who
assuredly hungered and thirsted after that very perfection of
righteousness, when he was unwilling to be lifted up by the greatness of
his revelations; and yet that he might not be lifted up, he was not left
to his own choice and will, <span id="page_411">p. 411</span> <span
id="xviii.v.xviii-Page_411"></span>but received “the thorn in the flesh,
a messenger of Satan, to buffet him; on which account he besought the
Lord thrice that it might depart from him, and the Lord said unto him,
My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in
weakness.” <span id="fr_2746"></span>[2747](#fn_2746.md) What strength,
save that to which it belongs not to be lifted up? And who doubts that
this belongs to righteousness? The angels of God, then, are endowed with
this perfection of righteousness, since they always behold the face of
the Father, and thus of the entire Trinity, because they see through the
Son, in the Holy Spirit. But nothing is more sublime than that
revelation, nor yet does any of the angels in that contemplation of
rejoicing ones find a messenger of Satan needful that he may be buffeted
by him, lest so great a magnitude of revelation should lift him up. The
apostle Paul certainly had not yet that perfection of virtue, nor yet
was he equal to the angels of God; but there was in him the weakness of
lifting himself up, which also had to be checked by the angel of Satan,
lest he should be lifted up by the magnitude of his revelations.
Although, then, the first lifting up cast down Satan, <span
id="fr_2747"></span>[2748](#fn_2747.md) yet that greatest Physician, who
well knew how to make use of even evil things, applied from the angel of
Satan, against the mischief of elation, a wholesome, although a painful,
medicament, just as an antidote used to be made even of serpents against
the poisons of serpents. What, then, is the meaning of “My grace is
sufficient for thee,” except that you may not by giving way succumb to
the buffet of the messenger of Satan? And what is “Strength is made
perfect in weakness,” except that in that place of weakness hitherto,
there may be the perfection of virtue, so that in the very presence of
infirmity, lifting-up may be repressed? Which infirmity assuredly shall
be healed by future immortality. For how is that soundness to be called
perfect where medicine is still needful, even from the buffet of an
angel of Satan?
