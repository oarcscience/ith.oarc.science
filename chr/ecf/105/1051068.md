<span id="xxi.ii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32 \[XVI.\]—The Twofold
Calling.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxii-p2"></span>God indeed calls many predestinated
children of His, to make them members of His only predestinated Son,—not
with that calling with which they were called who would not come to the
marriage, since with that calling were called also the Jews, to whom
Christ crucified is an offence, and the Gentiles, to whom Christ
crucified is foolishness; but with that calling He calls the
predestinated which the apostle distinguished when he said that he
preached Christ, the wisdom of God and the power of God, to them that
were called, Jews as well as Greeks. For thus he says “But unto them
which are called,” <span id="fr_3512"></span>[3513](#fn_3512) in order
to show that there were some who were not called; knowing that there is
a certain sure calling of those who are called according to God’s
purpose, whom He has foreknown and predestinated before to be conformed
to the image of His Son. And it was this calling he meant when he said,
“Not of works, but of Him that calleth; it was said unto her, That the
elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_3513"></span>[3514](#fn_3513) Did he say, “Not of works, but of
him that believeth”? Rather, he actually took this away from man, that
he might give the whole to God. Therefore he said, “But of Him that
calleth,”—not with any sort of calling whatever, but with that calling
wherewith a man is made a believer.
