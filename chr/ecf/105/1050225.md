<span id="xi.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49.—The Grace Promised by the Prophet
for the New Covenant.</span>

<span id="xi.lii-p2"></span>What then could the apostle have meant to
imply by,—after checking the boasting of the Jews, by telling them that
“not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the
law shall be justified,” <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962)
—immediately afterwards speaking of them “which, having not the law, do
by nature the things contained in the law,” <span
id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963) if in this description not they are to
be understood who belong to the Mediator’s grace, but rather they who,
while not worshipping the true God with true godliness, do yet exhibit
some good works in the general course of their ungodly lives? Or did the
apostle perhaps deem it probable, because he had previously said that
“with God there is no respect of persons,” <span
id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964) and had afterwards said that “God is
not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles,” <span
id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965) —that even such scanty little works of
the law, as are suggested by nature, were not discovered in such as
received not the law, except as the result of the remains of the image
of God; which He does not disdain when they believe in Him, with whom
there is no respect of persons? But whichever of these views is
accepted, it is evident that the grace of God was promised to the new
testament even by the prophet, and that this grace was definitively
announced to take this shape,—God’s laws were to be written in men’s
hearts; and they were to arrive at such a knowledge of God, that they
were not each one to teach his neighbour and brother, saying, Know the
Lord; for all were to know Him, from the least to the greatest of
them. <span id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966) This is the gift of the
Holy Ghost, by which love is shed abroad in our hearts, <span
id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967) —not, indeed, any kind of love, but
the love of God, “out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an
unfeigned faith,” <span id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968) by means of
which the just man, while living in this pilgrim state, is led on, after
the stages of “the glass,” and “the enigma,” and “what is in part,” to
the actual vision, that, face to face, he may know even as he is
known. <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969) For one thing has he
required of the Lord, and that he still seeks after, that he may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of his life, in order to behold
the pleasantness of the Lord. <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970)
