<span id="xiii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>(22.) Passages to Show that God’s
Commandments are Not Grievous.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxvi-p2"></span>He afterwards adduces those passages
which represent God as recommending His own commandments as not
grievous: let us now attend to their testimony. “Because,” says he,
“God’s commandments are not only not impossible, but they are not even
grievous. In Deuteronomy: <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span
id="xiii.xxvi-Page_167"></span>‘The Lord thy God will again turn and
rejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced over thy fathers, if ye shall
hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep His commandments, and
His ordinances, and His judgments, written in the book of this law; if
thou turn to the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
soul. For this command, which I give thee this day, is not grievous,
neither is it far from thee: it is not in heaven, that thou shouldest
say, Who will ascend into heaven, and obtain it for us, that we may hear
and do it? neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
will cross over the sea, and obtain it for us, that we may hear and do
it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart, and in
thine hands to do it.’ <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454) In the
Gospel likewise the Lord says: ‘Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn
of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto
your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.’ <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455) So also in the Epistle of Saint
John it is written: ‘This is the love of God, that we keep His
commandments: and His commandments are not grievous.’” <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456) On hearing these testimonies out of
the law, and the gospel, and the epistles, let us be built up unto that
grace which those persons do not understand, who, “being ignorant of
God’s righteousness, and wishing to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457) For, if they understand not the
passage of Deuteronomy in the sense that the Apostle Paul quoted
it,—that “with the heart men believe unto righteousness, and with their
mouth make confession unto salvation;” <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458) since “they that be whole need not
a physician, but they that are sick,” <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459) —they certainly ought (by that very
passage of the Apostle John which he quoted last to this effect: “This
is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments
are not grievous” <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460) ) to be
admonished that God’s commandment is not grievous to the love of God,
which is shed abroad in our hearts only by the Holy Ghost, not by the
determination of man’s will by attributing to which more than they
ought, they are ignorant of God’s righteousness. This love, however,
shall then be made perfect, when all fear of punishment shall be cut
off.
