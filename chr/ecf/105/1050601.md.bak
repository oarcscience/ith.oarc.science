<span id="xvi.v.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—Even Now While We Still Have
Concupiscence We May Be Safe in Christ.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxvi-p2"></span>But the apostle pursues the subject,
and says, “So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with
the flesh the law of sin;” <span id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md)
which must be thus understood: “With my mind I serve the law of God,” by
refusing my consent to the law of sin; “with my flesh, however,” I serve
“the law of sin,” by having the desires of sin, from which I am not yet
entirely freed, although I yield them no assent. Then let us observe
carefully what he has said after all the above: “There is therefore now
no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md) Even *now*, says he, when the law
in my members keeps up its warfare against the law of my mind, and
retains in captivity somewhat in the body of this death, there is no
condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. And listen why: “For the
law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus,” says he, “hath made me free
from the law of sin and death.” <span
id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182.md) How made me free, except by
abolishing its sentence of guilt by the remission of all my sins; so
that, though it still remains, only daily lessening more and more, it is
nevertheless not imputed to me as sin?
