<span id="xvi.vi.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36 \[XXI.\]—God Made Nature Good:
the Saviour Restores It When Corrupted.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxxvii-p2"></span>Now we do not reprehend bread and
wine because some men are luxurious and drunkards, any more than we
disapprove of gold because of the greedy and avaricious. Wherefore on
the same principle we do not censure the honourable connection between
husband and wife, because of the shame-causing lust of bodies. For the
former would have been quite possible before any antecedent commission
of sin, and by it the united pair would not have been made to blush;
whereas the latter arose after the perpetration of sin, and they were
obliged to hide it, from very shame. <span
id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) Accordingly, in all united pairs
ever since, however well and lawfully they have used this evil, there
has been a permanent necessity of avoiding the sight of man in any work
of this kind, and thus acknowledging what caused inevitable shame,
though a good thing would certainly cause no man to be ashamed. In this
way we have two distinct facts insensibly introduced to our notice: the
good of that laudable union of the sexes for the purpose of generating
children; and the evil of that shameful lust, in consequence of which
the offspring must be regenerated in order to escape condemnation. The
man, therefore, who, though with the lust which causes shame, joins in
lawful cohabitation, turns an evil to good account; whereas he who joins
in an unlawful cohabitation uses an evil badly; for that is more
correctly called evil than good, at which both bad and good alike blush.
We do better to believe him who has said, “I know that in me, that is,
in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing,” <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) rather than him who calls that
<span id="page_298">p. 298</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.xxxvii-Page_298"></span>good, by which he is so conformed
that he admits it to be evil; but if he feels no shame, he adds the
worse evil of impudence. Rightly then did we declare that “the good of
marriage is no more impeachable because of the original sin which is
derived therefrom, than the evil of adultery and fornication can be
excused, because of the natural good which is born of them:” since the
human nature which is born, whether of wedlock or of adultery, is the
work of God. Now if this nature were an evil, it ought not to have been
born; if it had not evil, it would not have to be regenerated: and (that
I may combine the two cases in one and the same predicate) if human
nature were an evil thing, it would not have to be saved; if it had not
in it any evil, it would not have to be saved. He, therefore, who
contends that nature is not good, says that the Maker of the creature is
not good; whilst he who will have it, that nature has no evil in it,
deprives it in its corrupted condition of a merciful Saviour. From this,
then, it follows, that in the birth of human beings neither fornication
is to be excused on account of the good which is formed out of it by the
good Creator, nor is marriage to be impeached by reason of the evil
which has to be healed in it by the merciful Saviour.
