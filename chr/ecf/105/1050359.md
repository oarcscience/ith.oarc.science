<span id="xiii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—(23.) Passages of Scripture
Which, When Objected Against Him by the Catholics, Cœlestius Endeavours
to Elude by Other Passages: the First Passage.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxvii-p2"></span>After this he adduced the passages which
are usually quoted against them. He does not attempt to explain these
passages, but, by quoting what seem to be contrary ones, he has
entangled the questions more tightly. “For,” says he, “there are
passages of Scripture which are in opposition to those who ignorantly
suppose that they are able to destroy the liberty of the will, or the
possibility of not sinning, by the authority of Scripture. For,” he
adds, “they are in the habit of quoting against us what holy Job said:
‘Who is pure from uncleanness? Not one; even if he be an infant of only
one day upon the earth.’” <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md)
Then he proceeds to give a sort of answer to this passage by help of
other quotations; as when Job himself said: “For although I am a
righteous and blameless man, I have become a subject for mockery,” <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) —not understanding that a man may
be called righteous, who has gone so far towards perfection in
righteousness as to be very near it; and this we do not deny to have
been in the power of many even in this life, when they walk in it by
faith.
