Needful for Ease of Performance is Really Necessary for the
Performance.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxx-p2"></span>In like manner, in another passage of
the same book, he says: “In order that men may more easily accomplish by
grace that which they are commanded to do by free will.” Now, expunge
the phrase “*more easily,*” and you leave not only a full, but also a
sound sense, if it be regarded as meaning simply this: “That men may
accomplish through grace what they are commanded to do by free will.”
The addition of the words “more easily,” however, tacitly suggests the
possibility of accomplishing good works even without the grace of God.
But such a meaning is disallowed by Him who says, “Without me ye can do
nothing.” <span id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863)
