<span id="xii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25 \[XXIII.\]—God Forsakes Only Those
Who Deserve to Be Forsaken. We are Sufficient of Ourselves to Commit
Sin; But Not to Return to the Way of Righteousness. Death is the
Punishment, Not the Cause of Sin.</span>

<span id="xii.xxix-p2"></span>Perhaps he may answer that God does not
compel men to do these things, but only forsakes those who deserve to be
forsaken. If he does say this, he says what is most true. For, as I have
already remarked, those who are forsaken by the light of righteousness,
and are therefore groping in darkness, produce nothing else than those
works of darkness which I have enumerated, until such time as it is said
to them, and they obey the command: “Awake thou that sleepest, and arise
from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.” <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md) The truth designates them as dead;
whence the passage: “Let the dead bury their dead.” The truth, then,
designates as *dead* those whom this man declares to have been unable to
be damaged or corrupted by sin, on the ground, forsooth, that he has
discovered sin to be no substance! Nobody tells him that “man was so
formed as to be able to pass from righteousness to sin, and yet not able
to return from sin to righteousness.” But that free will, whereby man
corrupted his own self, was sufficient for his passing into sin; but to
return to righteousness, he has need of a Physician, since he is out of
health; he has need of a Vivifier, because he is dead. Now about such
grace as this he says not a word, as if he were able to cure himself by
his own will, since this alone was able to ruin him. We do not tell him
that the death of the body is of efficacy for sinning, because it is
only its <span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span
id="xii.xxix-Page_130"></span>punishment; for no one sins by undergoing
the death of his body; but the death of the soul is conducive to sin,
forsaken as it is by its life, that is, its God; and it must needs
produce dead works, until it revives by the grace of Christ. God forbid
that we should assert that hunger and thirst and other bodily sufferings
necessarily produce sin. When exercised by such vexations, the life of
the righteous only shines out with greater lustre, and procures a
greater glory by overcoming them through patience; but then it is
assisted by the grace, it is assisted by the Spirit, it is assisted by
the mercy of God; not exalting itself in an arrogant will, but earning
fortitude by a humble confession. For it had learnt to say unto God:
“Thou art my hope; Thou art my trust.” <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md) Now, how it happens that concerning
this grace, and help and mercy, without which we cannot live, this man
has nothing to say, I am at a loss to know; but he goes further, and in
the most open manner gainsays the grace of Christ whereby we are
justified, by insisting on the sufficiency of nature to work
righteousness, provided only the will be present. The reason, however,
why, after sin has been released to the guilty one by grace, for the
exercise of faith, there should still remain the death of the body,
although it proceeds from sin, I have already explained, according to my
ability, in those books which I wrote to Marcellinus of blessed
memory. <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md)

<span id="xii.xxix-p5"></span> The tribune Marcellinus had been put to
death in the September of 413, “having, though innocent, fallen a victim
to the cruel hatred of the tyrant Heraclius,” as Jerome writes in his
book iii. against the Pelagians. Honorius mentions him as a “man of
conspicuous renown,” in a law enacted August 30, in the year 414,
contained in the *Cod Theod*. xvi. 5 (de hæreticis), line 55. Compare
the notes above, pp. 15 and 80.
