<span id="xxi.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—Faith is the Beginning of
a Christian Man. Martyrdom for Christ’s Sake is His Best Ending.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.iv-p2"></span>This matter being settled, let us see
whether this perseverance, of which it was said, “He that persevereth
unto the end, the same shall be saved,” <span
id="fr_3560"></span>[3561](#fn_3560.md) is a gift of God. And if it be not,
how is that saying of the apostle true: “Unto you it is given in the
behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His
sake”? <span id="fr_3561"></span>[3562](#fn_3561.md) Of these things,
certainly, one has respect to the beginning, the other to the end. Yet
each is the gift of God, because both are said to be given; as, also, I
have already said above. For what is more truly the beginning for a
Christian than to believe in Christ? What end is better than to suffer
for Christ? But so far as pertains to believing in Christ, whatever kind
of contradiction has been discovered, that not the beginning but the
increase of faith should be called God’s gift,—to this opinion, by God’s
gift, I have answered enough, and more than enough. But what reason can
be given why perseverance to the end should not be given in Christ to
him to whom it is given to suffer for Christ, or, to speak more
distinctly, to whom it is given to die for Christ? For the Apostle
Peter, showing that this is the gift of God, says, “It is better, if the
will of God be so, to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.” <span
id="fr_3562"></span>[3563](#fn_3562.md) When he says, “If the will of God
be so,” he shows that this is divinely given, and yet not to all saints,
to suffer for Christ’s sake. For certainly those whom the will of God
does not will to attain to the experience and the glory of suffering, do
not fail to attain to the kingdom of God if they persevere in Christ to
the end. But who can say that this perseverance is not given to those
who die in Christ from any weakness of body, or by any kind of accident,
although a far more difficult perseverance is given to those by whom
even <span id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.iv-Page_527"></span>death itself is undergone for Christ’s
sake? Because perseverance is much more difficult when the persecutor is
engaged in preventing a man’s perseverance; and therefore he is
sustained in his perseverance unto death. Hence it is more difficult to
have the former perseverance,—easier to have the latter; but to Him to
whom nothing is difficult it is easy to give both. For God has promised
this, saying, “I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not
depart from me.” <span id="fr_3563"></span>[3564](#fn_3563.md) And what
else is this than, “Such and so great shall be my fear that I will put
into their hearts that they will perseveringly cleave to me”?
