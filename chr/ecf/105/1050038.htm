<p class="c46"><a name="x.iii.xx-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="x.iii.xx-p1.1"></A>Chapter 20.&#8212;Original Sin Alone is Contracted by Natural Birth.</span></p>  
<p><a name="x.iii.xx-p2"></A>&#8220;Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">271</FONT></A>
 This addition to original sin men now made of their own wilfulness, not through Adam; but even this is done away and remedied by Christ, because &#8220;where sin abounded, grace did much more abound; that as sin hath reigned unto death&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">272</FONT></A>
&#8212;even that sin which men have not derived from Adam, but have added of their own will&#8212;&#8220;even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">273</FONT></A>
 There is, however, other righteousness apart from Christ, as there are other sins apart from Adam. Therefore, after saying, &#8220;As sin hath reigned unto death,&#8221; he did not add in the same clause &#8220;<i>by one</i>,&#8221; or &#8220;<i>by Adam</i>,&#8221; because he had already spoken of that sin which was abounding when the law entered, and which, of course, was not original sin, but the sin of man&#146;s own wilful commission. But after he has said: &#8220;Even so might grace also reign through righteousness unto eternal life,&#8221; he at once adds, &#8220;through Jesus Christ our Lord;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">274</FONT></A>
 because, whilst by the generation of the flesh only that sin is contracted which is original; yet by the regeneration of the Spirit there is effected the remission not of original sin only, but also of the sins of man&#146;s own voluntary and actual commission.</p>
