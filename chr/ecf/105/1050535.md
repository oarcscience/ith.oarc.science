<span id="xv.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Pelagius’ Long Residence at
Rome.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>The truth indeed is, that in the book of
his faith which he sent to Rome with this very letter <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948) to the before-mentioned Pope
Innocent, to whom also he had written the letter, he only the more
evidently exposed himself by his efforts at concealment. He says: <span
id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949) “We hold one baptism, which we say
ought to be administered in the same sacramental words in the case of
infants as in the case of adults.” He did not, however, say, “in the
same sacrament” (although if he had so said, there would still have been
ambiguity), but “in the same sacramental words,”—as if remission of sins
in infants were declared by the sound of the words, and not wrought by
the effect of the acts. For the time, indeed, he seemed to say what was
agreeable with the catholic faith; but he had it not in his power
permanently to deceive that see. Subsequent to the rescript of the
African Council, into which province this pestilent doctrine had
stealthily made its way—without, however, spreading widely or sinking
deeply—other opinions also of this man were by the industry of some
faithful brethren discovered and brought to light at Rome, where he had
dwelt for a very long while, and had already engaged in sundry
discourses and controversies. In order to procure the condemnation of
these opinions, Pope Zosimus, as you may read, annexed them to his
letter, which he wrote for publication throughout the catholic world.
Among these statements, Pelagius, pretending to expound the Apostle
Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, argues in these words: “If Adam’s sin
injured those who have not sinned, then also Christ’s righteousness
profits those who do not believe.” He says other things, too, of the
same purport; but they have all been refuted and answered by me with the
Lord’s help in the books which I wrote, *On the Baptism of
Infants*. <span id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950) But he had not the
courage to make those objectionable statements in his own person in the
fore-mentioned so-called exposition. This particular one, however,
having been enunciated in a place where he was so well known, his words
and their meaning could not be disguised. In those books, from the first
of which I have already before quoted, <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951) he treats this point without any
suppression of his views. With all the energy of which he is capable, he
most plainly asserts that human nature in infants cannot in any wise be
supposed to be corrupted by propagation; and by claiming salvation for
them as their due, he does despite to the Saviour.
