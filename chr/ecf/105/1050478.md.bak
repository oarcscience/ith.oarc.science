<span id="xv.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XXII.\]—Pelagius’ Double
Dealing Concerning the Ground of the Conferrence of Grace.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>Perhaps, however, our own antecedent
merits caused this gift to be bestowed upon us; as this writer has
already suggested in reference to God’s grace, in that work which he
addressed to a holy virgin, <span id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md)
whom he mentions in the letter sent by him to Rome. For, after adducing
the testimony of the Apostle James, in which he says, “Submit yourselves
unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you,” <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md) he goes on to say: “He shows us how
we ought to resist the devil, if we submit ourselves indeed to God and
by doing His will merit His divine grace, and by the help of the Holy
Ghost more easily withstand the evil spirit.” Judge, then, how sincere
was his condemnation in the Palestine Synod of those persons who say
that God’s grace is conferred on us according to our merits! Have we any
doubt as to his still holding this opinion, and most openly proclaiming
it? Well, how could that confession of his before the bishops have been
true and real? Had he already written the book in which he most
explicitly alleges that grace is bestowed on us according to our
deserts—the very position which he without any reservation condemned at
that Synod in the East? Let him frankly acknowledge that he once held
the opinion, but that he holds it no longer; so should we most frankly
rejoice in his improvement. As it is, however, when, besides other
objections, this one was laid to his charge which we are now discussing,
he said in reply: “Whether these are the opinions of Cœlestius or not,
is the concern of those who affirm that <span id="page_225">p.
225</span> <span id="xv.iii.xxiii-Page_225"></span>they are. For my own
part, indeed, I never entertained such views; on the contrary, I
anathematize every one who does entertain them.” <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) But how could he “never have
entertained such views,” when he had already composed this work? Or how
does he still “anathematize everybody who entertains these views,” if he
afterwards composed this work?
