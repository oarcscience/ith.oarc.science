id="xvii.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32 \[XIX.\]—The
Self-Contradiction of Victor as to the Origin of the Soul.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>Under these circumstances, I find
that this treatise of mine must now be closed. It contains, in fact, all
that seemed to me chiefly necessary to the subject under discussion.
They who peruse its contents will know how to be on their guard against
agreeing with the person whose two books you sent me, so as not to
believe with him, that souls are produced by the breath of God in such
wise as not to be made out of nothing. The man, indeed, who supposes
this, however much he may in words deny the conclusion, does in reality
affirm that souls have the substance of God, and are His offspring, not
by endowment, but by nature. For from whomsoever a man derives the
origin of his nature, from him, in all sober earnestness, it must needs
be admitted, that he also derives the kind of his nature. But this
author is, after all, self-contradictory: at one time he says that
“souls are the offspring of God,—not, indeed, by nature, but by
endowment;” and at another time he says, that “they are not made out of
nothing, but derive their origin from God.” Thus he does not hesitate to
refer them to the nature of God, a position which he had previously
denied.
