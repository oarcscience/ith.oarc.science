<span id="xii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36 \[XXXII.\]—Pride Even in Such Things
as are Done Aright Must Be Avoided. Free Will is Not Taken Away When
Grace is Preached.</span>

<span id="xii.xl-p2"></span>So will He bestow on us whatever pleases
Him, that if there be anything displeasing to Him in us, it will also be
displeasing to us. “He will,” as the Scripture has said, “turn aside our
paths from His own way,” <span id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) and
will make that which is His own to be our way; because it is by Himself
that the favour is bestowed on such as believe in Him and hope in Him
that we will do it. For there is a way of righteousness of which they
are ignorant “who have a zeal for God, but not according to
knowledge,” <span id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md) and who, wishing
to frame a righteousness of their own, “have not submitted themselves to
the righteousness of God.” <span id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md)
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth;” <span id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) and He has said,
“I am the way.” <span id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md) Yet God’s
voice has alarmed those who have already begun to walk in this way, lest
they should be lifted up, as if it were by their own energies that they
were walking therein. For the same persons to whom the apostle, on
account of this danger, says, “Work out your own salvation with fear and
trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of
His good pleasure,” <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) are
likewise for the self-same reason admonished in the psalm: “Serve the
Lord with fear, and rejoice in Him with trembling. Accept correction,
lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the righteous
way, when His wrath shall be suddenly kindled upon you.” <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) He does not say, “Lest at any time
the Lord be angry and refuse to show you the righteous way,” or, “refuse
to lead you into the way of righteousness;” but even after you are
walking therein, he was able so to terrify as to say, “Lest ye perish
from the righteous way.” Now, whence could this arise if not from pride,
which (as I have so often said, and must repeat again and again) has to
be guarded against even in things which are rightly done, that is, in
the very way of righteousness, lest a man, by regarding as his own that
which is really God’s, lose what is God’s and be reduced merely to what
is his own? Let us then carry out <span id="page_134">p. 134</span>
<span id="xii.xl-Page_134"></span>the concluding injunction of this same
psalm, “Blessed are all they that trust in Him,” <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) so that He may Himself indeed
effect and Himself show His own way in us, to whom it is said, “Show us
Thy mercy, O Lord;” <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) and
Himself bestow on us the pathway of safety that we may walk therein, to
whom the prayer is offered, “And grant us Thy salvation;” <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) and Himself lead us in the
self-same way, to whom again it is said, “Guide me, O Lord, in Thy way,
and in Thy truth will I walk;” <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) Himself, too, conduct us to those
promises whither His way leads, to whom it is said, “Even there shall
Thy hand lead me and Thy right hand shall hold me;” <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) Himself pasture therein those who
sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom it is said, “He shall
make them sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.” <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) Now we do not, when we make mention
of these things, take away freedom of will, but we preach the grace of
God. For to whom are those gracious gifts of use, but to the man who
uses, but humbly uses, his own will, and makes no boast of the power and
energy thereof, as if it alone were sufficient for perfecting him in
righteousness?
