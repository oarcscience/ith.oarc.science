<span id="xvi.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—The Same Continued.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.iv-p2"></span>The words which he has quoted and
endeavoured to refute out of my book, which I sent to you, and with
which you are very well acquainted, are the following: “They are
constantly affirming, in their excessive hatred of us, that we condemn
marriage and that divine procedure by which God creates human beings by
means of men and women, inasmuch as we maintain that they who are born
of such a union contract original sin, and do not deny that, of whatever
parents they are born, they are still under the devil’s dominion unless
they be born again in <span id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.iv-Page_284"></span>Christ.” <span
id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195.md) Now, in quoting these words of
mine, he took care to omit the testimony of the apostle, which I adduced
by the weighty significance of which he felt himself too hard pressed.
For, after saying that men at their birth contract original sin, I at
once introduced the apostle’s words: “By one man sin entered into the
world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him
all men sinned.” <span id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196.md) Well, as I
have already mentioned, he omitted this passage of the apostle, and then
closed up the other remarks of mine which have been now quoted. For he
knew too well how acceptable to the hearts and consciences of all
faithful catholics are these words of the apostle, which I had adopted,
but which he omitted,—words which are so direct and so clear, that these
new-fangled heretics use every effort in their dark and tortuous glosses
to obscure and deprave their force.
