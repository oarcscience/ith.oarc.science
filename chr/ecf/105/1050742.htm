<p class="c46"><a name="xvii.vi.x-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvii.vi.x-p1.1"></A>Chapter 10.&#8212;His Fourth Error. (See Above in Book I. 6 [VI.] and Book II. 11 [VII.].)</span></p>  
<p><a name="xvii.vi.x-p2"></A>Neither believe, nor say, nor teach that &#8220;the soul, by means of the flesh, repairs its ancient condition, and is born again by the very means through which it had deserved to be polluted,&#8221; if you wish to be a catholic. I might, indeed, dwell upon the strange discrepancy with your own self which you have exhibited in the next sentence, wherein you said that the soul through the flesh deservedly recovers its primitive condition, which it had seemed to have gradually lost through the flesh, in order that it may begin to be regenerated by the very flesh through which it had deserved to be polluted.&#8221; Here you&#8212;the very man who had just before said that the soul repairs its condition through the flesh, by reason of which it had lost its desert (where nothing but <i>good desert</i> can be meant, which you will have to be recovered in the flesh, by baptism, of course)&#8212;said in another turn of your thought, that through the flesh the soul had deserved to be polluted (in which statement it is no longer the good desert, but <i>an evil one,</i> which must be meant). What flagrant inconsistency! but I will pass it over, and content myself with observing, that it is absolutely uncatholic to believe that the soul, previous to its incarnate state, deserved either good or evil.</p>
