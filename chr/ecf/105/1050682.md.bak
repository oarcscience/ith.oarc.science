<span id="xvii.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[IX.\]—Another Error of Victor’s,
that Infants Dying Unbaptized May Attain to the Kingdom of Heaven.
Another, that the Sacrifice of the Body of Christ Must Be Offered for
Infants Who Die Before They are Baptized.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.x-p2"></span>But when he wished to answer with
respect, however, to those infants who are prevented by death from being
first baptized in Christ, he was so bold as to promise them not only
paradise, but also the kingdom of heaven,—finding no way else of
avoiding the necessity of saying that God condemns to eternal death
innocent souls which, without any previous desert of sin, He introduces
into sinful flesh. He saw, however, to some extent what evil he was
giving utterance to, in implying that without any grace of Christ the
souls of infants are redeemed to everlasting life and the kingdom of
heaven, and that in their case original sin may be cancelled without
Christ’s baptism, in which is effected the forgiveness of sins:
observing all this, and into what a depth he had plunged in his sea of
shipwreck, he says, “I am of opinion that for them, indeed, constant
oblations and sacrifices must be continually offered up by holy
priests.” You may here behold another danger, out of which he will never
escape except by regret and a recall of his words. For who can offer up
the body of Christ for any except for those who are members of Christ?
Moreover, from the time when He said, “Except a man be born of water and
of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven;” <span
id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) and again, “He that loseth his life
for my sake shall find it;” <span id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md)
no one becomes a member of Christ except it be either by baptism in
Christ, or death for Christ. <span id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md)
