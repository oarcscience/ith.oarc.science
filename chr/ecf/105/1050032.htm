<p><a name="x.iii.xiv-p2"></A>&#8220;But,&#8221; says he, &#8220;not as the offence so also is the free gift. For if, through the offence of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by One Man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">257</FONT></A>
 Not <i>many more</i>, that is, many more men, for there are not more persons justified than condemned; but it runs, <i>much more hath abounded</i>; inasmuch as, while Adam produced sinners from his one sin, Christ has by His grace procured free forgiveness even for the sins which men have of their own accord added by actual transgression to the original sin in which they were born. This he states more clearly still in the sequel.</p>
