id="xx.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Some Instances of God’s Amazing
Judgments.</span>

<span id="xx.xxi-p2"></span>It is, indeed, to be wondered at, and
greatly to be wondered at, that to some of His own children—whom He has
regenerated in Christ—to whom He has given faith, hope, and love, God
does not give perseverance also, when to children of another He forgives
such wickedness, and, by the bestowal of His grace, makes them His own
children. Who would not wonder at this? Who would not be exceedingly
astonished at this? But, moreover, it is not less marvellous, and still
true, and so manifest that not even the enemies of God’s grace can find
any means of denying it, that some children of His friends, that is, of
regenerated and good believers, departing this life as infants without
baptism,—although He certainly might provide the grace <span
id="page_479">p. 479</span> <span id="xx.xxi-Page_479"></span>of this
laver if He willed, since in His power are all things,—He alienates from
His kingdom into which He introduces their parents; and some children of
His enemies He causes to come into the hands of Christians, and by means
of this laver introduces into the kingdom, from which their parents are
aliens; although, as well to the former infants there is no evil
deserving, as to the latter there is no good, of their own proper will.
Certainly, in this case the judgments of God, because they are righteous
and deep, may neither be blamed nor penetrated. Among these also is that
concerning perseverance, of which we are now discoursing. Of both,
therefore, we may exclaim, “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and
knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments!” <span
