<span id="xv.iv.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—Pelagius Rightly Condemned and
Really Opposed by Ambrose.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xlviii-p2"></span>These words, however, of the man of
God are contradicted by Pelagius, notwithstanding all his commendation
of his author, when he himself declares that “we are procreated, as
without virtue, so without vice.” <span
id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) What remains, then, but that
Pelagius should condemn and renounce this error of his; or else be sorry
that he has quoted Ambrose in the way he has? Inasmuch, however, as the
blessed Ambrose, catholic bishop as he is, has expressed himself in the
above-quoted passages in accordance with the catholic faith, it follows
that Pelagius, along with his disciple Cœlestius, was justly condemned
by the authority of the catholic Church for having turned aside from the
true way of faith, since he repented not for having bestowed
commendation on Ambrose, and for having at the same time entertained
opinions in opposition to him. I know full well with what insatiable
avidity you <span id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md) read whatever is
written for edification and in confirmation of the faith; but yet,
notwithstanding its utility as contributing to such an end, I must at
last bring this treatise to a conclusion.
