<span id="xx.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—God Not Only Foreknows that Men
Will Be Good, But Himself Makes Them So.</span>

<span id="xx.xxxix-p2"></span>It is He Himself, therefore, that makes
those men good, to do good works. For He did not promise them to Abraham
because He foreknew that of themselves they would be good. For if this
were the case, what He promised was not His, but theirs. But it was not
thus that Abraham believed, but “he was not weak in faith, giving glory
to God;” and “most fully believing that what He has promised He is able
also to perform.” <span id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365.md) He does not
say, “What He foreknew, He is able to promise;” nor “What He foretold,
He is able to manifest;” nor “What He promised, He is able to foreknow:”
but “What He promised, He is able also to do.” It is He, therefore, who
makes them to persevere in good, who makes them good. But they who fall
and perish have never been in the number of the predestinated. Although,
then, the apostle might be speaking of all persons regenerated and
living piously when he said, “Who art thou that judgest another man’s
servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth;” yet he at once had
regard to the predestinated, and said, “But he shall stand;” and that
they might not arrogate this to themselves, he says, “For God is able to
make him stand.” <span id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366.md) It is He
Himself, therefore, that gives perseverance, who is able to establish
those who stand, so that they may stand fast with the greatest
perseverance; or to restore those who have fallen, for “the Lord setteth
up those who are broken down.” <span
