<span id="xviii.v.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xviii.v.i-p2.1"></span>There</span> still follow things which they
calumniously object to us; they do not yet begin to work out those
things which they themselves think. But lest the prolixity of these
writings should be an offence, I have divided those matters which they
object into two Books,—the former of which being completed, which is the
Second Book of this entire work, I am here commencing the other, and
joining it as the Third to the First and Second.
