<span id="xx.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[V.\]—The Necessity and Advantage of
Rebuke.</span>

<span id="xx.x-p2"></span>To this we answer: Whoever you are that do not
the commandments of God that are already known to you, and do not wish
to be rebuked, you must be rebuked even for that very reason that you do
not wish to be rebuked. For you do not wish that your faults should be
pointed out to you; you do not wish that they should be touched, and
that such a useful pain should be caused you that you may seek the
Physician; you do not desire to be shown to yourself, that, when you see
yourself to be deformed, you may wish for the Reformer, and <span
id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span id="xx.x-Page_474"></span>may
supplicate Him that you may not continue in that repulsiveness. For it
is your fault that you are evil; and it is a greater fault to be
unwilling to be rebuked because you are evil, as if faults should either
be praised, or regarded with indifference so as neither to be praised
nor blamed, or as if, indeed, the dread, or the shame, or the
mortification of the rebuked man were of no avail, or were of any other
avail in healthfully stimulating, except to cause that He who is good
may be besought, and so out of evil men who are rebuked may make good
men who may be praised. For what he who will not be rebuked desires to
be done for him, when he says, “Pray for me rather,”—he must be rebuked
for that very reason that he may himself also do for himself; because
that mortification with which he is dissatisfied with himself when he
feels the sting of rebuke, stirs him up to a desire for more earnest
prayer,  <span id="fr_3260"></span>[3261](#fn_3260.md) that, by God’s
mercy, he may be aided by the increase of love, and cease to do things
which are shameful and mortifying, and do things praiseworthy and
gladdening. This is the benefit of rebuke that is wholesomely applied,
sometimes with greater, sometimes with less severity, in accordance with
the diversity of sins; and it is then wholesome when the supreme
Physician looks. For it is of no profit unless when it makes a man
repent of his sin. And who gives this but He who looked upon the Apostle
Peter when he denied, <span id="fr_3261"></span>[3262](#fn_3261.md) and
made him weep? Whence also the Apostle Paul, after he said that they
were to be rebuked with moderation who thought otherwise, immediately
added, “Lest perchance God give them repentance, to the acknowledging of
the truth, and they recover themselves out of the snares of the
devil.” <span id="fr_3262"></span>[3263](#fn_3262.md)
