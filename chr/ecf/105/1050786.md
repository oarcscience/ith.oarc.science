id="xvii.vii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—Is Corporeity Necessary for
Recognition?</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxx-p2"></span>But who is able to trace out what
capacity of recognition even souls which are not good possess after
death when relieved of the corruptible bodies, so as to be able by an
inner sense to observe and recognise either souls that are evil like
themselves, or even good ones, either in states which are actually not
corporeal, but the semblances of bodies; or else in good or evil
affections of the mind, in which there occur no lineaments whatever of
bodily members? Whence arises the fact that the rich man in the parable,
though in torments, recognised “Father Abraham,” whose face and figure
he had never seen, but the semblance of whose body his soul, though
incorporeal, was able to comprehend? <span
id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500) But who could rightly say that he
had known any man, except in so far as he has had means of knowing his
life and disposition, which have, of course, neither material substance
nor colours? It is in this way that we know ourselves more certainly
than any others, because our own consciousness and disposition are all
before us. This we plainly perceive, and yet we see therein no
similitude of a bodily substance. But we do not perceive this inner
quality of our nature in another man, even if he be present before our
eyes; though in his absence we recollect his features, and recognise
them, and think of them. Our own features, however, we cannot in the
same manner recollect, and recognise, and think of; and yet with most
perfect truth we say that we are ourselves better known to ourselves
than he is, so manifest is it where lies the stronger and truer
knowledge of man.
