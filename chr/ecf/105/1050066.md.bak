id="x.iii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—From the Epistles to
Timothy.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xlviii-p2"></span>And then to Timothy he says: “This is
a faithful saying, <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) and worthy of
all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;
of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me
first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to
them which should hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting.” <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) He also says: “For there is one God
and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave
Himself a ransom for all.” <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) In
his second Epistle to the same Timothy, he says: “Be not thou therefore
ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner: but be
thou a fellow-labourer for the gospel, according to the power of God;
who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to
our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given
us in Christ Jesus before the world began; but is now manifested by the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath
brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.” <span
