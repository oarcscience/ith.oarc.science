id="xv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[VI.\]—Cœlestius the Disciple is In
This Work Bolder Than His Master.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.vi-p2"></span>Carefully observe, then, what Cœlestius
has advanced so very openly, and you will discover what amount of
concealment Pelagius has practised upon you. Cœlestius goes on to say as
follows: “That infants, however, must be baptized for the remission of
sins, was not admitted by us with the view of our seeming to affirm sin
by transmission. This is very alien from the catholic meaning, because
sin is not born with a man,—it is subsequently committed by the man for
it is shown to be a fault, not of nature, but of the will. It is
fitting, therefore, to confess this, lest we should seem to make
different kinds of baptism; it is, moreover, necessary to lay down this
preliminary safeguard, lest by the occasion of this mystery evil should,
to the disparagement of the Creator, be said to be conveyed to man by
nature, before that it has been committed by man.” Now Pelagius was
either afraid or ashamed to avow this to be his own opinion before you;
although his disciple experienced neither a qualm nor a blush in openly
professing it to be his, without any obscure subterfuges, in presence of
the Apostolic See.
