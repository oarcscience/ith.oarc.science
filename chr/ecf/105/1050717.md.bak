<span id="xvii.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[V.\]—How Could the Incorporeal
God Breathe Out of Himself a Corporeal Substance?</span>

<span id="xvii.v.ix-p2"></span>In that he believes God to be truly
incorporeal, I congratulate him that herein, at all events, he has kept
himself uninfluenced by the ravings of Tertullian. For *he* insisted,
that as the soul is corporeal, so likewise is God. <span
id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) It is therefore specially
surprising that our author, who differs from Tertullian in this point,
yet labours to persuade us that the incorporeal God does not make the
soul out of nothing, but exhales it as a corporeal breath out of
Himself. What a wonderful learning that must be to which every age
erects its attentive ears, and which contrives to gain for its disciples
men of advanced years, and even presbyters! Let this eminent man read
what he has written, read it in public; let him invite to hear the
reading well-known persons and unknown ones, learned and unlearned. Old
men, assemble with your younger instructors; learn what you used to know
nothing about; hear now what you had never heard before. Behold,
according to the teaching of this scribe, God creates a breath, not out
of something else which exists in some way or other, and not out of that
which absolutely has <span id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="xvii.v.ix-Page_335"></span>no existence; but out of that which He is
Himself, perfectly incorporeal, He breathes a body so that He actually
changes His own incorporeal nature into a body, before it undergoes the
change into the body of sin. Does he say, that He does not change
something out of His own nature, when He creates breath? Then, of
course, He does not make that breath out of Himself: for He is not
Himself one thing, and His nature another thing. What is this insane man
thinking of? But if he says that God creates breath out of His own
nature in such a way as to remain absolutely entire Himself, this is not
the question. The question is, whether that which comes not of some
previously created substance, nor from nothing, but from Him, is not
what He is, that is, of the same nature and essence? Now He remains
absolutely entire after the generation of His Son; but because He begat
Him of His own nature, He did not beget a something which was different
from that which He is Himself. For, putting to one side the circumstance
that the Word took on Himself a human nature and became flesh, the Word
who is the Son of God is another but not another thing: that is, He is
another person but not a different nature. And whence does this come to
pass, except from the fact that He is not created out of something else,
or out of nothing, but was begotten out of Himself; not that He might be
better than He was, but that He might be altogether even what *He* is of
whom He is begotten; that is, of one and the same nature, equal,
co-eternal, in every way like, equally unchangeable, equally invisible,
equally incorporeal, equally God; in a word, that He might be altogether
what the Father is, except that He actually is Himself the Son, and not
the Father? But if He remains Himself the same God entire and
unimpaired, but yet creates something different from Himself, and worse
than Himself, not out of nothing, nor out of some other creature, but
out of His very self; and that something emanates as a body out ofthe
incorporeal God; then God forbid that a catholic should imbibe such an
opinion, for it does not flow from the divine fountain, but it is a mere
fiction of the human mind.
