<span id="xiii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—(29.) The Second Passage. Who
May Be Said to Abstain from Every Evil Thing.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxxiii-p2"></span>“They are in the habit of next
quoting,” says he, “the passage: ‘Every man is a liar.’” <span
id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) But here again he offers no
solution of words which are quoted against himself even by himself; all
he does is to mention other apparently opposite passages before persons
who are unacquainted with the sacred Scriptures, and thus to cast the
word of God into conflict. This is what he says: “We tell them in
answer, how in the book of Numbers it is said, ‘Man is true.’ <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) While of holy Job this eulogy is
read: ‘There was a certain man in the land of Ausis, whose name was Job;
that man was true, blameless, righteous, and godly, abstaining from
every evil thing.’” <span id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) I am
surprised that he has brought forward this passage, which says that Job
“abstained from every evil thing,” wishing it to mean “abstained from
every sin;” because he has argued already <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) that sin is not a thing, but an
act. Let him recollect that, even if it is an act, it may still be
called a thing. That man, however, abstains from every evil thing, who
either never consents to the sin, which is always with him, or, if
sometimes hard pressed by it, is never oppressed by it; just as the
wrestling champion, who, although he is sometimes caught in a fierce
grapple, does not for all that lose the prowess which constitutes him
the better man. We read, indeed, of a man without blame, of one without
accusation; but we never read of one without sin, except the Son of man,
who is also the only-begotten Son of God.
