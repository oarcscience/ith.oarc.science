<span id="xi.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—The New Law Written
Within.</span>

<span id="xi.xxxiii-p2"></span>Now, observe how consonant this diversity
is with those words of the apostle which I quoted not long ago in
another connection, and which <span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span
id="xi.xxxiii-Page_96"></span>I postponed for a more careful
consideration afterwards: “Forasmuch,” says he, “as ye are manifestly
declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with
ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but
in fleshy tables of the heart.” <span id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md)
See how he shows that the one is written without man, that it may alarm
him from without; the other within man himself, that it may justify him
from within. He speaks of the “fleshy tables of the heart,” not of the
carnal mind, but of a living agent possessing sensation, in comparison
with a stone, which is senseless. The assertion which he subsequently
makes,—that “the children of Israel could not look stedfastly on the end
of the face of Moses,” and that he accordingly spoke to them through a
veil, <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) —signifies that the letter
of the law justifies no man, but that rather a veil is placed on the
reading of the Old Testament, until it shall be turned to Christ, and
the veil be removed;—in other words, until it shall be turned to grace,
and be understood that from Him accrues to us the justification, whereby
we do what He commands. And He commands, in order that, because we lack
in ourselves, we may flee to Him for refuge. Accordingly, after most
guardedly saying, “Such trust have we through Christ to God-ward,” <span
id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) the apostle immediately goes on to add
the statement which underlies our subject, to prevent our confidence
being attributed to any strength of our own. He says: “Not that we are
sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our
sufficiency is of God; who also hath made us fit to be ministers of the
New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter
killeth, but the spirit giveth life.” <span
