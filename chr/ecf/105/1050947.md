<span id="xix.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[VI.\]—The Grace of God is Not
Given According to Merit, But Itself Makes All Good Desert.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xiii-p2"></span>From these and similar passages of
Scripture, we gather the proof that God’s grace is not given according
to our merits. The truth is, we see that it is given not only where
there are no good, but even where there are many evil merits preceding:
and we see it so given daily. But it is plain that when it has been
given, also our good merits begin to be,—yet only by means of it; for,
were that only to withdraw itself, man falls, not raised up, but
precipitated by free will. Wherefore no man ought, even when he begins
to possess good merits, to attribute them to himself, but to God, who is
thus addressed by the Psalmist: “Be Thou my helper, forsake me
not.” <span id="fr_3026"></span>[3027](#fn_3026.md) By saying, “Forsake me
not,” he shows that if he were to be forsaken, he is unable of himself
to do any good thing. Wherefore also he says: “I said in my abundance, I
shall never be moved,” <span id="fr_3027"></span>[3028](#fn_3027.md) for he
thought that he had such an abundance of good to call his own that he
would not be moved. But in order that he might be taught whose that was,
of which he had begun to boast as if it were his own, he was admonished
by the gradual desertion of God’s grace, and says: “O Lord, in Thy good
pleasure Thou didst add strength to my beauty. Thou didst, however, turn
away Thy face, and then I was troubled and distressed.” <span
id="fr_3028"></span>[3029](#fn_3028.md) Thus, it is necessary for a man
that he should be not only justified when unrighteous by the grace of
God,—that is, be changed from unholiness to righteousness,—when he is
requited with good for his evil; but that, even after he has become
justified by faith, grace should accompany him on his way, and he should
lean upon it, lest he fall. On this account it is written concerning the
Church herself in the book of Canticles: “Who is this that cometh up in
white raiment, leaning upon her kinsman?” <span
id="fr_3029"></span>[3030](#fn_3029.md) Made white is she who by herself
alone could not be white. And by whom has she been made white except by
Him who says by the prophet, “Though your sins be as purple, I will make
them white as snow”? <span id="fr_3030"></span>[3031](#fn_3030.md) At the
time, then, that she was made white, she deserved nothing good; but now
that she is made white, she walketh well;—but it is only by her
continuing ever to lean upon Him by whom she was made white. Wherefore,
Jesus Himself, on whom she leans that was made white, said to His
disciples, “Without me ye can do nothing.” <span
