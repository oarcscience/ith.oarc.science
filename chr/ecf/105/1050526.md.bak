id="xv.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15 \[XIV.\]—Pelagius by His Mendacity
and Deception Stole His Acquittal from the Synod in Palestine.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xv-p2"></span>For my own part, however, I, as you are
quite aware, and as I also stated in the book which I addressed to our
venerable and aged Aurelius on the proceedings in Palestine, really felt
glad that Pelagius in that answer of his had exhausted the whole of this
question. <span id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941.md) To me, indeed, he
seemed most plainly to have acknowledged that there is original sin in
infants, by the anathema which he pronounced against those persons who
supposed that by the sin of Adam only himself, and not the human race,
was injured, and who entertained the opinion that infants are in the
same state in which the first man was before the transgression. When,
however, I had read his four books (from the first of which I copied the
words which I have just now quoted), and discovered that he was still
cherishing thoughts which were opposed to the catholic faith touching
infants, I felt all the greater surprise at a mendacity which he so
unblushingly maintained in a synod of the Church, and on so great a
question. For if he had already written these books, how did he profess
to anathematize those who had ever entertained the opinions alluded to?
If he purposed, however, afterwards to publish such a work, how could he
anathematize those who at the time were holding the opinions? Unless, to
be sure, by some ridiculous subterfuge he meant to say that the objects
of his anathema were such persons as had in some previous time held, or
were then holding, these opinions; but that in respect of the
future—that is, as regarded those persons who were about to take up with
such views—he felt that it would be impossible for him to prejudge
either himself or other people, and that therefore he was guilty of no
lie when he was afterwards detected in the maintenance of similar
errors. This plea, however, he does not advance, not only because it is
a ridiculous one, but because it cannot possibly be true; because in
these very books of his he both argues against the transmission of sin
from Adam to infants, and glories in the proceedings of the Synod in
Palestine, where he was supposed to have sincerely anathematized such as
hold the opinions in dispute, and where he, in fact, stole his acquittal
by practising deceit.
