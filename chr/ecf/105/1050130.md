<span id="x.iv.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—Children of Believers are Called
“Clean” By the Apostle. <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603) </span>

<span id="x.iv.xli-p3"></span>The apostle indeed says, “*Else* were your
children *unclean*, but *now* are they *holy*;” <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604) and “therefore” they infer “there was
no necessity for the children of believers to be baptized.” I am
surprised at the use of such language by persons who deny that original
sin has been transmitted from Adam. For, if they take this passage of
the apostle to mean that the children of believers are born in a state
of holiness, how is it that even they have no doubt about the necessity
of their being baptized? Why, in fine, do they refuse to admit that any
original sin is derived from a sinful parent, if some holiness is
received from a holy parent? Now it certainly does not contravene our
assertion, even if from the faithful “holy” children are propagated,
when we hold that unless they are baptized those go into damnation, to
whom our opponents themselves shut the kingdom of heaven, although they
insist that they are without sin, whether actual or original. <span
id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605) Or, if they think it an unbecoming
thing for “holy ones” to be damned, how can it be a becoming thing to
exclude “holy ones” from the kingdom of God? They should rather pay
especial attention to this point, How can something sinful help being
derived from sinful parents, if something holy is derived from holy
parents, and uncleanness from unclean parents? For the twofold principle
was affirmed when he said, “Else were your children unclean, but now are
they holy.” They should also explain to us how it is right that the holy
children of believers and the unclean children of unbelievers are,
notwithstanding their different circumstances, equally prohibited from
entering the kingdom of God, if they have not been baptized. What avails
that sanctity of theirs to the one? Now if they were to maintain that
the unclean children of unbelievers are damned, but that the holy
children of believers are unable to enter the kingdom of heaven unless
they are baptized,—but nevertheless are not damned, because they are
“holy,”—that would be some sort of a distinction; but as it is, they
equally declare respecting the holy children of holy parents and the
unclean offspring of unclean parents, that they are not damned, since
they have not any sin; and that they are excluded from the kingdom of
God because they are unbaptized. What an absurdity! Who can suppose that
such splendid geniuses do not perceive it?
