id="xxi.iii.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 66 \[XXIV.\]—Recapitulation and
Exhortation.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lxviii-p2"></span>But what more shall I say? I think
that I <span id="page_552">p. 552</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.lxviii-Page_552"></span>have taught sufficiently, or rather
more than sufficiently, that both the beginning of faith in the Lord,
and continuance in the Lord unto the end, are God’s gifts. And other
good things which pertain to a good life, whereby God is rightly
worshipped, even they themselves on whose behalf I am writing this
treatise concede to be God’s gifts. Further, they cannot deny that God
has foreknown all His gifts, and the people on whom He was going to
bestow them. As, therefore, other things must be preached so that he who
preaches them may be heard with obedience, so predestination must be
preached so that he who hears these things with obedience may glory not
in man, and therefore not in himself, but in the Lord; for this also is
God’s precept, and to hear this precept with obedience—to wit, that he
who glories should glory in the Lord <span
id="fr_3712"></span>[3713](#fn_3712) —in like manner as the rest, is
God’s gift. And he who has not this gift,—I shrink not from saying
it,—whatever others he has, has them in vain. That the Pelagians may
have this we pray, and that our own brethren may have it more
abundantly. Let us not, therefore, be prompt in arguments and indolent
in prayers. Let us pray, dearly beloved, let us pray that the God of
grace may give even to our enemies, and especially to our brethren and
lovers, to understand and confess that after that great and unspeakable
ruin wherein we have all fallen in one, no one is delivered save by
God’s grace, and that grace is not repaid according to the merits of the
receivers as if it were due, but is given freely as true grace, with no
merits preceding.
