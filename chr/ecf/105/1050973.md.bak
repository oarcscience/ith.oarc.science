<span id="xix.iv.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—The Spirit of Fear a Great
Gift of God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxxix-p2"></span>The apostle also says to Timothy, “For
God hath not given to us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love,
and of a sound mind.” <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171.md) Now in
respect of this passage of the apostle, we must be on our guard against
supposing that we have not received the spirit of the fear of God, which
is undoubtedly a great gift of God, and concerning which the prophet
Isaiah says, “The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon thee, the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
knowledge and piety, the spirit of the fear of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172.md) It is not the fear with which Peter
denied Christ that we have received the spirit of, but that fear
concerning which Christ Himself says, “Fear Him who hath power to
destroy both soul and body in hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear
Him.” <span id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173.md) This, indeed, He said,
lest we should deny Him from the same fear which shook Peter; for such
cowardice he plainly wished to be removed from us when He, in the
preceding passage, said, “Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and
after that have no more that they can do.” <span
id="fr_3174"></span>[3175](#fn_3174.md) It is not of this fear that we have
received the spirit, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. And
of this spirit the same Apostle Paul discourses to the Romans: “We glory
in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and
patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed;
because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,
which is given unto us.” <span id="fr_3175"></span>[3176](#fn_3175.md) Not
by ourselves, therefore, but by the Holy Ghost which is given to us,
does it come to pass that, through that very love, which he shows us to
be the gift of God, tribulation does not do away with patience, but
rather produces it. Again, he says to the Ephesians, “Peace be to the
brethren, and love with faith.” <span
id="fr_3176"></span>[3177](#fn_3176.md) Great blessings these! Let him tell
us, however, whence they come. “From God the Father,” says he
immediately afterwards, “and the Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_3177"></span>[3178](#fn_3177.md) These great blessings, therefore,
are nothing else than God’s gifts to us.
