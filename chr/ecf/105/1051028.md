<span id="xx.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—In What Way God Wills All Men to
Be Saved.</span>

<span id="xx.xlvii-p2"></span>And what is written, that “He wills all
men to be saved,” <span id="fr_3388"></span>[3389](#fn_3388.md) while yet
all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I
have mentioned in other writings <span
id="fr_3389"></span>[3390](#fn_3389.md) of mine; but here I will say one
thing: “He wills all men to be saved,” is so said that all the
predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is
among them. Just as it was said to the Pharisees, “Ye tithe every
herb;” <span id="fr_3390"></span>[3391](#fn_3390.md) where the expression
is only to be understood of every herb that they had, for they did not
tithe every herb which was found throughout the whole earth. According
to the same manner of speaking, it was said, “Even as I also please all
men in all things.” <span id="fr_3391"></span>[3392](#fn_3391.md) For did
he who said this please also the multitude of his persecutors? But he
pleased every kind of men that assembled in the Church of Christ,
whether they were already established therein, or were to be introduced
into it.
