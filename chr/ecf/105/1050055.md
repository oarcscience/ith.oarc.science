<span id="x.iii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—How God Enlightens Every
Person.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span>That statement, therefore, which
occurs in the gospel, “That was the true Light, which lighteth every one
that cometh into the world,” <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323) has
this meaning, that no man is illuminated except with that Light of the
truth, which is God; so that no person must think that he is enlightened
by him whom he listens to as a learner, although that instructor happen
to be—I will not say, any great man—but even an angel himself. For the
word of truth is applied to man externally by the ministry of a bodily
voice, but yet “neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
watereth; but God that giveth the increase.”  <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324) Man indeed hears the speaker, be he
man or angel, but in order that he may perceive and know that what is
said is true, his mind is internally besprinkled with that light which
remains for ever, and which shines even in darkness. But just as the sun
is not seen by the blind, though they are clothed as it were with its
rays, so is the light of truth not understood by the darkness of folly.
