id="xvi.v.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30 \[XXVII.\]—The Evil Desires of
Concupiscence; We Ought to Wish that They May Not Be.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxx-p2"></span>For the concupiscence of the flesh is in
some sort active, even when it does not exhibit either an assent of the
heart, where its seat of empire is, or those members whereby, as its
weapons, it fulfils what it is bent on. But what in this action does it
effect, unless it be its evil and shameful desires? For if these were
good and lawful, the apostle would not forbid obedience to them, saying,
“Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey
the lusts thereof.” <span id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md) He does
not say, that ye should have the lusts thereof, but “that ye should obey
the lusts thereof;” in order that (as these desires are greater or less
in different individuals, according as each shall have progressed in the
renewal of the inner man) we may maintain the fight of holiness and
chastity, for the purpose of withholding obedience to these lusts.
Nevertheless, our wish ought to be nothing less than the nonexistence of
these very desires, even if the accomplishment of such a wish be not
possible in the body of this death. This is the reason why the same
apostle, in another passage, addressing us as if in his own person,
gives us this instruction: “For what I would,” says he, “that do I not;
but what I hate, that do I.” <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md)
In a word, “I covet.” <span id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159.md) For he
was unwilling to do this, that he might be perfect on every side. “If,
then, I do that which I would not,” he goes on to say, “I consent unto
the law that it is good.” <span id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md)
Because the law, too, wills not that which I also would not. For it
wills not that I should have concupiscence, for it says, “Thou shall not
covet;” <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md) and I am no less
unwilling to cherish so evil a desire. In this, therefore, there is
complete accord between the will of the law and my own will. But because
he was unwilling to covet, <span id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md)
and yet did covet, <span id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md) and for
all that did not by any means obey this concupiscence so as to yield
assent to it, he immediately adds these words: “Now, then, it is no more
I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.” <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md)
