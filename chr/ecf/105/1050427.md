<span id="xiv.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42 \[XVIII.\]—The Twelfth Item in the
Accusation. Other Heads of Cœlestius’ Doctrine Abjured by
Pelagius.</span>

<span id="xiv.xlvi-p2"></span>For it was objected that in the sixth
chapter of Cœlestius’ work there was laid down this position: “Men
cannot be called sons of God, unless they have become entirely free from
all sin.” It follows from this statement, that not even the Apostle Paul
is a child of God, since he said: “Not as though I had already attained,
either were already perfect.” <span id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md)
In the seventh chapter he makes this statement: “Forgetfulness and
ignorance have no connection with sin, as they do not happen through the
will, but through necessity;” although David says: “Remember not the
sins of my youth, nor my sins of ignorance;” <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md) although too, in the law,
sacrifices are offered for ignorance, as if for sin. <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742.md) In his tenth chapter he says: “Our
will is free, if it needs the help of God; inasmuch as every one in the
possession of his proper will has either something to do or to abstain
from doing.” In the twelfth he says: “Our victory comes not from God’s
help, but from our own free will.” And this is a conclusion which he was
said to draw in the following terms: “The victory is ours, seeing that
we took up arms of our own will; just as, on the other hand, being
conquered is our own, since it was of our own will that we neglected to
arm ourselves.” And, after quoting the phrase of the Apostle Peter,
“partakers of the divine nature,” <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743.md) he is said to have made out of it
this argument: “Now if our spirit or soul is unable to be without sin,
then even God is subject to sin, since this part of Him, that is to say,
the soul, is exposed to sin.” In his thirteenth chapter he says: “That
pardon is not given to penitents according to the grace and mercy of
God, but according to their own merits and effort, since through
repentance they have been worthy of mercy.”
