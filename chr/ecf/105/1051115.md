<span id="xxi.iii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—God Gives Both Initiatory and
Persevering Grace According to His Own Will.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxxv-p2"></span>From all which it is shown with
sufficient clearness that the grace of God, which both begins a man’s
faith and which enables it to persevere unto the end, is not given
according to our merits, but is given according to His own most secret
and at the same time most righteous, wise, and beneficent will; since
those whom He predestinated, them He also called, <span
id="fr_3624"></span>[3625](#fn_3624) with that calling of which it is
said, “The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.” <span
id="fr_3625"></span>[3626](#fn_3625) To which calling there is no man
that can be said by men with any certainty of affirmation to belong,
until he has departed from this world; but in this life of man, which is
a state of trial upon the earth, <span
id="fr_3626"></span>[3627](#fn_3626) he who seems to stand must take
heed lest he fall. <span id="fr_3627"></span>[3628](#fn_3627) Since (as
I have already said before) <span id="fr_3628"></span>[3629](#fn_3628)
those who will not persevere are, by the most foreseeing will of God,
mingled with those who will persevere, for the reason that we may learn
not to mind high things, but to consent to the lowly, and may “work out
our own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in
us both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” <span
id="fr_3629"></span>[3630](#fn_3629) We therefore will, but God worketh
in us to will also. We therefore work, but God worketh in us to work
also for His good pleasure. This is profitable for us both to believe
and to say,—this is pious, this is true, that our confession be lowly
and submissive, and that all should be given to God. Thinking, we
believe; thinking, we speak; thinking, we do whatever we do; <span
id="fr_3630"></span>[3631](#fn_3630) but, in respect of what concerns
the way of piety and the true worship of God, we are not sufficient to
think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God. <span
id="fr_3631"></span>[3632](#fn_3631) For “our heart and our thoughts are
not in our own power;” whence the same Ambrose who says this says also:
“But who is so blessed as in his heart always to rise upwards? And how
can this be done without divine help? Assuredly, by no means. Finally,”
he says, “the same Scripture affirms above, ‘Blessed is the man whose
help is of Thee; O Lord, <span id="fr_3632"></span>[3633](#fn_3632)
ascent is in his heart.’” <span id="fr_3633"></span>[3634](#fn_3633)
Assuredly, Ambrose was not only enabled to say this by reading in the
holy writings, but as of such a man is to be without doubt believed, he
felt it also in his own heart. Therefore, as is said in the sacraments
of believers, that we should lift up our hearts to the Lord, is God’s
gift; for which gift they to whom this is said are admonished by the
priest after this word to give thanks to our Lord God Himself; and they
answer that it is “meet and right so to do.”  <span
id="fr_3634"></span>[3635](#fn_3634) For, since our heart is not in our
own power, but is lifted up by the divine help, so that it ascends and
takes cognizance of those things which are above, <span
id="fr_3635"></span>[3636](#fn_3635) where Christ is sitting at the
right hand of God, and, not those things that are upon the earth, to
whom are thanks to be given for so great a gift as this unless to our
Lord God who doeth this,—who in so great kindness has chosen us by
delivering us from the abyss of this world, and has predestinated us
before the foundation of the world?
