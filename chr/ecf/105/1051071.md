<span id="xxi.ii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35 \[XVIII.\]—Election is for the
Purpose of Holiness.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxv-p2"></span>Who can hear the apostle saying,
“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
blessed us in all spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ; as He has
chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be
holy and without spot in His sight; in love predestinating us to the
adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself according to the good
pleasure of His will, wherein He hath shown us favour in His beloved
Son; in whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins
according to the riches of His grace, which hath abounded to us in all
wisdom and prudence; that He might show to us the mystery of His will
according to His good pleasure, which He hath purposed in Himself, in
the dispensation of the fulness of times, to restore all things in
Christ, which are in heaven, and in the earth, in Him: in whom also we
have obtained a share, being predestinated according to the purpose; who
worketh all things according to the counsel of His will, that we should
be to the praise of his glory;” <span
id="fr_3528"></span>[3529](#fn_3528.md) —who, I say, can hear these words
with attention and intelligence, and can venture to have any doubt
concerning a truth so clear as this which we are defending? God chose
Christ’s members in Him before the foundation of the world; and how
should He choose those who as yet did not exist, except by
predestinating them? Therefore He chose us by predestinating us. Would
he choose the unholy and the unclean? Now if the question be proposed,
whether He would choose such, or rather the holy and unstained, who can
ask which of these he may answer, and not give his opinion at once in
favour of the holy and pure?
