<span id="xii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[XII.\]—The Scope and Purpose of
the Law’s Threatenings; “Perfect Wayfarers.”</span>

<span id="xii.xvii-p2"></span>But before I proceed further, see what he
has said. When treating the question about the difference of sins, and
starting as an objection to himself, what certain persons allege, “that
some sins are light by their very frequency, their constant irruption
making it impossible that they should be all of them avoided;” he
thereupon denied that it was “proper that they should be censured even
as light offences, if they cannot possibly be wholly avoided.” He of
course does not notice the Scriptures of the New Testament, wherein we
learn <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151) that the intention of
the law in its censure is this, that, by reason of the transgressions
which men commit, they may flee for refuge to the grace of the Lord, who
has pity upon them—“the schoolmaster” <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152) “shutting them up unto the same
faith which should afterwards be revealed;” <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153) that by it their transgressions may
be forgiven, and then not again be committed, by God’s assisting grace.
The road indeed belongs to all who are progressing in it; although it is
they who make a good advance that are called “perfect travellers.” That,
however, is the height of perfection which admits of no addition, when
the goal to which men tend has begun to be possessed.
