<span id="xiv.v-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xiv.v-p2.1"></span>After</span> there came into my hands, holy
father Aurelius, the ecclesiastical proceedings, by which fourteen
bishops of the province of Palestine pronounced Pelagius a catholic, my
hesitation, in which I was previously reluctant to make any lengthy or
confident statement about the defence which he had made, came to an end.
This defence, indeed, I had already read in a paper which he himself
forwarded to me. Forasmuch, however, as I received no letter therewith
from him, I was afraid that some discrepancy might be detected between
my statement and the record of the ecclesiastical proceedings; and that,
should Pelagius perhaps deny that he had sent me any paper (and it would
have been difficult for me to prove that he had, when there was only one
witness), I should rather seem guilty in the eyes of those who would
readily credit his denial, either of an underhanded falsification, or
else (to say the least) of a reckless credulity. Now, however, when I am
to treat of matters which are shown to have actually transpired, and
when, as it appears to me, all doubt is removed whether he really acted
in the way described, your holiness, and everybody who reads these
pages, will no doubt be able to judge, with greater readiness and
certainty, both of his defence and of this my treatment of it.
