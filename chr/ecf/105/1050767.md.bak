<span id="xvii.vii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—The Apostle Peter Told No Lie,
When He Said He Was Ready to Lay Down His Life for the Lord, But Only
Was Ignorant of His Will.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xi-p2"></span>But perhaps you despise me for
confessing all this, and will in consequence compare me with “cattle.”
For myself, however, I will not cease to advise you, or (if you refuse
to listen to me) at all events to warn you, to acknowledge rather this
common infirmity, in which virtue is perfected; lest, by assuming
unknown things to be known, you fail to attain to the truth. For I
suppose that there is something which even you wish to understand, but
are unable; which you would never seek to understand, unless you hoped
some day to succeed in your research. Thus you also are ignorant of the
powers of your own understanding, who profess to know all about your own
nature, and decline to follow me in my confession of ignorance. Well,
there is also the will; what am I to say about that, where certainly
free choice is ostentatiously claimed by us? The blessed Apostle Peter,
indeed, was willing to lay down his life for the Lord. He was no doubt
sincere in his willingness; nor was he treacherous to the Lord when he
made the promise. But his will was entirely ignorant of its own powers.
Therefore the great apostle, who had discovered his Master to be the Son
of God, was unknown to himself. Thus we are quite aware respecting
ourselves that we will a thing, or “nill” it; but although our will is a
good one, we are ignorant, my dear son, unless we deceive ourselves, of
its strength, of its re<span id="page_359">p. 359</span> <span

yield to, or of what it may resist.
