<p><a name="xvii.iv.xii-p2"></A>Concerning Dinocrates, however, the brother <A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A> <a name="xvii.iv.xii-Page_320"></A>of St. Perpetua, there is no record in the canonical Scripture; nor does the saint herself, or whoever it was that wrote the account, say that the boy, who had died at the age of seven years, died without baptism; in his behalf she is believed to have had, when her martyrdom was imminent, her prayers effectually heard that he should be removed from the penalties of the lost to rest. Now, boys at that time of life are able both to lie, and, saying the truth, both to confess and deny. Therefore, when they are baptized they say the Creed, and answer in their behalf to such questions as are proposed to them in examination. Who can tell, then, whether that boy, after baptism, in a time of persecution was estranged from Christ to idolatry by an impious father, and on that account incurred mortal condemnation, from which he was only delivered for Christ&#146;s sake, given to the prayers of his sister when she was at the point of death?</p>
