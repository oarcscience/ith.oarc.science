<span id="xvi.vi.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51.—To Call Those that Teach
Original Sin Manicheans is to Accuse Ambrose, Cyprian, and the Whole
Church.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.lii-p2"></span>What, moreover, shall I say of those
commentators on the divine Scriptures who have flourished in the
catholic Church? They have never tried to pervert these testimonies to
an alien sense, because they were firmly established in our most ancient
and solid faith, and were never moved aside by the novelty of error.
Were I to wish to collect these together, and to make use of their
testimony, the task would both be too long, and I should probably seem
to have bestowed less preference than I ought on canonical
authorities, <span id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md) from which one
must never deviate. I will merely mention the most blessed Ambrose, to
whom (as I have already observed <span
id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315) .md) Pelagius accorded so signal a
testimony of his integrity in the faith. This Ambrose, however,
maintained that there was nothing else in infants, which required the
healing grace of Christ, than original sin. <span
id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316.md) But in respect of Cyprian, with his
all-glorious crown, <span id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) will any
one say of him, that he either was, or ever could by any possibility
have been, a Manichean, when he suffered before the pestilent heresy had
made its appearance in the Roman world? And yet, in his book on the
baptism of infants, he so vigorously maintains original sin as to
declare, that even before the eighth day, if necessary, the infant ought
to be baptized, lest his soul should be lost; and he wished it to be
understood, that the infant could the more readily attain to the
indulgence of baptism, inasmuch as it is not so much his own sins, but
the sins of another, which are remitted to him. Well, then, let this
writer dare to call these Manicheans; let him, moreover, under this
scandalous imputation asperse that most ancient tradition of the Church,
whereby infants are, as I have said, exorcised with exsufflation, for
the purpose of being translated into the kingdom of Christ, after they
are delivered from the power of darkness—that is to say, of the devil
and his angels. As for ourselves, indeed, we are more ready to be
associated with these men, and with the Church of Christ, so firmly
rooted in this ancient faith, in suffering any amount of curse and
contumely, than with the Pelagians, to be covered with the flattery of
public praise.
