<span id="xi.lx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 57 \[XXXIII.\]—Whence Comes the Will to
Believe?</span>

<span id="xi.lx-p2"></span>But it remains for us briefly to inquire,
Whether the will by which we believe be itself the gift of God, or
whether it arise from that free will which is naturally implanted in us?
If we say that it is not the gift of God, we must <span id="page_109">p.
109</span> <span id="xi.lx-Page_109"></span>then incur the fear of
supposing that we have discovered some answer to the apostle’s
reproachful appeal: “What hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now, if
thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not
received it?” <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) —even some such
an answer as this: “See, we have the will to believe, which we did not
receive. See in what we glory,—even in what we did not receive!” If,
however, we were to say that this kind of will is nothing but the gift
of God, we should then have to fear lest unbelieving and ungodly men
might not unreasonably seem to have some fair excuse for their unbelief,
in the fact that God has refused to give them this will. Now this that
the apostle says, “It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do
of His own good pleasure,” <span id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md)
belongs already to that grace which faith secures, in order that good
works may be within the reach of man,—even the good works which faith
achieves through the love which is shed abroad in the heart by the Holy
Ghost which is given to us. If we believe that we may attain this grace
(and of course believe voluntarily), then the question arises whence we
have this will?—if from nature, why it is not at everybody’s command,
since the same God made all men? if from God’s gift, then again, why is
not the gift open to all, since “He will have all men to be saved, and
to come unto the knowledge of the truth?” <span
