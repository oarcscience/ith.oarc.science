<span id="xxi.ii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[VI.\]—That Some Men are Elected
is of God’s Mercy.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xi-p2"></span>“Many hear the word of truth; but some
believe, while others contradict. Therefore, the former will to believe;
the latter do not will.” Who does not know this? Who can deny this? But
since in some the will is prepared by the Lord, in others it is not
prepared, we must assuredly be able to distinguish what comes from God’s
mercy, and what from His judgment. “What Israel sought for,” says the
apostle, “he hath not obtained, but the election hath obtained it; and
the rest were blinded, as it is written, God gave to them the spirit of
compunction,—eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should
not hear, even to this day. And David said, Let their table be made a
snare, a retribution, and a stumblingblock to them; let their eyes be
darkened, that they may not see; and bow down their back always.” <span
id="fr_3457"></span>[3458](#fn_3457) Here is mercy and judgment,—mercy
towards the election which has obtained the righteousness of God, but
judgment to the rest which have been blinded. And yet the former,
because they <span id="page_504">p. 504</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.xi-Page_504"></span>willed, <span
id="fr_3458"></span>[3459](#fn_3458) believed; the latter, because they
did not will believed not. Therefore mercy and judgment were manifested
in the very wills themselves. Certainly such an election is of grace,
not at all of merits. For he had before said, “So, therefore, even at
this present time, the remnant has been saved by the election of grace.
And if by grace, now it is no more of works; otherwise grace is no more
grace.” <span id="fr_3459"></span>[3460](#fn_3459) Therefore the
election obtained what it obtained gratuitously; there preceded none of
those things which they might first give, and it should be given to them
again. He saved them for nothing. But to the rest who were blinded, as
is there plainly declared, it was done in recompense. “All the paths of
the Lord are mercy and truth.” <span
id="fr_3460"></span>[3461](#fn_3460) But His ways are unsearchable.
Therefore the mercy by which He freely delivers, and the truth by which
He righteously judges, are equally unsearchable.
