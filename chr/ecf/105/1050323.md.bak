Constantinople.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxx-p2"></span>He quotes also John, bishop of
Constantinople, as saying “that sin is not a substance, but a wicked
act.” Who denies this? “And because it is not natural, therefore the law
was given against it, and because it proceeds from the liberty of our
will.” <span id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) Who, too, denies this?
However, the present question concerns our human nature in its corrupted
state; it is a further question also concerning that grace of God
whereby our nature is healed by the great Physician, Christ, whose
remedy it would not need if it were only whole. And yet your author
defends it as capable of not sinning, as if it were sound, or as if its
freedom of will were self-sufficient.
