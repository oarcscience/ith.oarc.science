id="xiii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—(12.) The Twelfth Breviate.</span>

<span id="xiii.xvi-p2"></span>XII. “Again the question arises,” he says,
“how it is that man is unable to be without sin,—by his will, or by
nature? If by nature, it is not sin; if by his will, then will can very
easily be changed by will.” We answer by reminding him how he ought to
reflect on the extreme presumption of saying—not simply that it is
possible (for this no doubt is undeniable, when God’s grace comes in
aid), but—that it is “*very easy*” for will to be changed by will;
whereas the apostle says, “The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other;
so that ye do not the things that ye would.” <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) He does not say, “These are
contrary the one to the other, so that ye will not do the things that ye
can,” but, “so that ye do not the things that ye would.” <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) How happens it, then, that the lust
of the flesh which of course is culpable and corrupt, and is nothing
<span id="page_163">p. 163</span> <span
id="xiii.xvi-Page_163"></span>else than the desire for sin, as to which
the same apostle instructs us not to let it “reign in our mortal
body;” <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md) by which expression he
shows us plainly enough that that must have an existence in our mortal
body which must not be permitted to hold a dominion in it;—how happens
it, I say, that such lust of the flesh has not been changed by that
will, which the apostle clearly implied the existence of in his words,
“So that ye do not the things that ye *would*,” if so be that the will
can so easily be changed by will? Not that we, indeed, by this argument
throw the blame upon the nature either of the soul or of the body, which
God created, and which is wholly good; but we say that it, having been
corrupted by its own will, cannot be made whole without the grace of
God.
