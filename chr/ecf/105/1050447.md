<span id="xiv.lxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.lxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 62.—The History Continued. Cœlestius
Condemned at Carthage by Episcopal Judgment. Pelagius Acquitted by
Bishops in Palestine, in Consequence of His Deceptive Answers; But Yet
His Heresy Was Condemned by Them.</span>

<span id="xiv.lxvi-p2"></span>After this heresy had deceived a great
many persons, and was disturbing the brethren whom it had failed to
deceive, one Cœlestius, who entertained these sentiments, was brought up
for trial before the Church of Carthage, and was condemned by a sentence
of the bishops. <span id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763.md) Then, a few
years afterwards, Pelagius, who was said to have been this man’s
instructor, having been accused of holding his heresy, found also his
way before an episcopal tribunal. <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md) The indictment was prepared against
him by the Gallican bishops, Heros and Lazarus, who were, however, not
present at the proceedings, and were excused from attendance owing to
the illness of one of them. After all the charges were duly recited, and
Pelagius had met them by his answers, the fourteen bishops of the
province of Palestine pronounced him, in accordance with his answers,
free from the perversity of this heresy; while yet without hesitation
condemning the heresy itself. They approved indeed of his answer to the
objections, that “a man is assisted by a knowledge of the law, towards
not sinning; even as it is written, ‘He hath given them a law for a
help;’” <span id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) but yet they
disapproved of this knowledge of the law being that grace of God
concerning which the Scripture says: “Who shall deliver me from the body
of this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span
id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) Nor did Pelagius say absolutely:
“All men are ruled by their own will,” as if God did not rule them; for
he said, when questioned on this point: “This I stated in the interest
of the freedom of our will; God is its helper, whenever it makes choice
of good. Man, however, when sinning, is himself in fault, as being under
the direction of his free will.” <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md) They approved, moreover, of his
statement, that “in the day of judgment no forbearance will be shown to
the ungodly and sinners, but they will be punished in everlasting
fires;” because in his defence he said, “that he had made such an
assertion in accordance with the gospel, in which it is written
concerning sinners, ‘These shall go away into eternal punishment, but
the righteous into life eternal.’” <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md) But he did not say, all sinners are
reserved for eternal punishment, for then he would evidently have run
counter to the apostle, who distinctly states that some of them will be
saved, “yet so as by fire.” <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md)
When also Pelagius said that “the kingdom of heaven was promised even in
the Old Testament,” they approved of the statement, on the ground that
he supported himself by the testimony of the prophet Daniel, who thus
wrote: “The saints shall take the kingdom of the Most High.” <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md) They understood him, in this
statement of his, to mean by the term “Old Testament,” not simply the
Testament which was made on Mount Sinai, but the entire body of the
canonical Scriptures which had been given previous to the coming of the
Lord. His allegation, however, that “a man is able to be without sin, if
he wishes,” was not approved by the bishops in the sense which he had
evidently meant it to bear in his book <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) —as if this was solely in a man’s
power by free will (for it was contended that he must have meant no less
than this by his saying: “if he wishes”),—but only in the sense which he
actually gave to the passage on the present occasion in his answer; in
the very sense, indeed, in which the episcopal judges mentioned the
subject in their own interlocution with especial brevity and clearness,
that a man is able to be without sin with the help and grace of God. But
still it was left undetermined when the saints were to attain to this
state of perfection,—whether in the body of this death, or when death
shall be swallowed up in victory.
