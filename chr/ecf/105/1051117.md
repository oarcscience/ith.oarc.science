<span id="xxi.iii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—What Predestination
is.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span>Will any man dare to say that God
did not foreknow those to whom He would give to believe, or whom He
would give to His Son, that of them He should lose none? <span
id="fr_3641"></span>[3642](#fn_3641.md) And certainly, if He foreknew these
things, He as certainly foreknew His own kindnesses, wherewith He
condescends to deliver us. This is the predestination of the
saints,—nothing else; to wit, the foreknowledge and the preparation of
God’s kindnesses, whereby they are most certainly delivered, whoever
they are that are delivered. But where are the rest left by the
righteous divine judgment except in the mass of ruin, where the Tyrians
and the Sidonians were left? who, moreover, might have believed if they
had seen Christ’s wonderful miracles. But since it was not given to them
to believe, the means of believing also were denied them. From which
fact it appears that some have in their understanding itself a naturally
divine gift of intelligence, by which they may be moved to the faith, if
they either hear the words or behold the signs congruous to their minds;
and yet if, in the higher judgment of God, they are not by the
predestination of grace separated from the mass of perdition, neither
those very divine words nor deeds are applied to them by which they
might believe if they only heard or saw such things. Moreover, in the
same mass of ruin the Jews were left, because they could not believe
such great and eminent mighty works as were done in their sight. For the
gospel has not been silent about the reason why they could not believe,
since it says: “But though He had done such great miracles before them,
yet they believed not on Him; that the saying of Isaiah the prophet
might be fulfilled which he spake, <span
id="fr_3642"></span>[3643](#fn_3642.md) Lord, who hath believed our report,
and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? And, therefore, they
could not believe, because that Isaiah said again, <span
id="fr_3643"></span>[3644](#fn_3643.md) He hath blinded their eyes and
hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor
understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal
them.” <span id="fr_3644"></span>[3645](#fn_3644.md) Therefore the eyes of
the Tyrians and Sidonians were not so blinded nor was their heart so
hardened, since they would have believed if they had seen such mighty
works, as the Jews saw. But it did not profit them that they were able
to believe, because they were not predestinated by Him whose judgments
are inscrutable and His ways past finding out. Neither would inability
to believe have been a hindrance to them, if they had been so
predestinated as that God should illuminate those blind eyes, and should
will to take away the stony heart from those hardened ones. But what the
Lord said of the Tyrians and Sidonians may perchance be understood in
another way: that no one nevertheless comes to Christ unless it were
given him, and that it is given to those who are chosen in Him before
the foundation of the world, he confesses beyond a doubt who hears the
divine utterance, not with the deaf ears of the flesh, but with the ears
of the heart; and yet this predestination, which is plainly enough
unfolded even by the words of the gospels, did not prevent the Lord’s
saying as well in respect of the commencement, what I have a little
before mentioned, “Believe in God; believe also in me,” as in respect of
perseverance, “A man ought always to pray, and not to faint.” <span
id="fr_3645"></span>[3646](#fn_3645.md) For they hear these things and do
them to whom it is given; but they do them not, whether they hear or do
not hear, to whom it is not given. Because, “To you,” said He, “it is
given to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is
not given.” <span id="fr_3646"></span>[3647](#fn_3646.md) Of these, the one
refers to the mercy, the other to the judgment of Him to whom our soul
cries, “I will sing of mercy and judgment unto Thee, O Lord.” <span
id="fr_3647"></span>[3648](#fn_3647.md)
