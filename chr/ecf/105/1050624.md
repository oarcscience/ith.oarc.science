<span id="xvi.vi.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[VII.\]—The Pelagians are Not
Ashamed to Eulogize Concupiscence, Although They are Ashamed to Mention
Its Name.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xviii-p2"></span>But among so many names of good
things, such as bodies, sexes, unions, he never once mentions the lust
or concupiscence of the flesh. He is silent, because he is ashamed; and
yet with a strange shamelessness of shame (if the expression may be
used), he is not ashamed to praise what he is ashamed to mention. Now
just observe how he prefers to point to his object by circumlocution
rather than by direct mention of it. “After that the man,” says he, “by
natural appetite knew his wife.” See again, he refused to say, He knew
his wife by carnal concupiscence; but he used the phrase, “by natural
appetite,” by which it is open to us to understand that holy and
honourable will which wills the procreation of children, and not that
lust, of which even he is so much ashamed, forsooth, that he prefers to
use ambiguous language to us, to expressing his mind in unmistakeable
words. “Now what is the meaning of his phrase—“by natural appetite”? Is
not both the wish to be saved and the wish to beget, nourish, and
educate children, natural appetite? and is it not likewise of reason,
and not of lust? Since, however, we can ascertain his intention, we are
pretty sure that he meant by these words to indicate the lust of the
organs of generation. Do not the words in question appear to you to be
the fig-leaves, under cover of which is hidden nothing else but that
which he feels ashamed of? For just as they of old sewed the leaves
together  <span id="fr_2233"></span>[2234](#fn_2233.md) as a girdle of
concealment, so has this man woven a web of circumlocution to hide his
meaning. Let him weave out his statement: “But when the man knew his
wife by natural appetite, the divine Scripture says, Eve conceived, and
bare a son, and called his name Cain. But what,” he adds, “does Adam
say? Let us hear: I have obtained a man from God. So that it is evident
that he was God’s work, and the divine Scripture testifies to his having
been received from God.”  <span id="fr_2234"></span>[2235](#fn_2234.md)
Well, who can entertain a doubt on this point? Who can deny this
statement, especially if he be a catholic Christian? A man is God’s
work; but carnal concupiscence (without which, if sin had not preceded,
man would <span id="page_290">p. 290</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.xviii-Page_290"></span>have been begotten by means of the
organs of generation, not less obedient than the other members to a
quiet and normal will) is not of the Father, but is of the world. <span
