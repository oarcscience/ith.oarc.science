<span id="xii.lxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 70 \[LX.\]—Whether Any Man is Without
Sin in This Life.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxiv-p2"></span>Now, whether there ever has been, or is,
or ever can be, a man living so righteous a life in this world as to
have no sin at all, may be an open question among true and pious
Christians; <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) but whoever
doubts the possibility of this sinless state *after this present life*;
is foolish. For my own part, indeed, I am unwilling to dispute the point
even as respects this life. For <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="xii.lxxiv-Page_146"></span>although that passage seems to me to be
incapable of bearing any doubtful sense, wherein it is written, “In thy
sight shall no man living be justified” <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302) (and so of similar passages.md), yet I
could wish it were possible to show either that such quotations were
capable of bearing a better signification, or that a perfect and plenary
righteousness, to which it were impossible for any accession to be made,
had been realized at some former time in some one whilst passing through
this life in the flesh, or was now being realized, or would be
hereafter. They, however, are in a great majority, who, while not
doubting that to the last day of their life it will be needful to them
to resort to the prayer which they can so truthfully utter, “Forgive us
our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,” <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) still trust that in Christ and His
promises they possess a true, certain, and unfailing hope. There is,
however, no method whereby any persons arrive at absolute perfection, or
whereby any man makes the slightest progress to true and godly
righteousness, but the assisting grace of our crucified Saviour Christ,
and the gift of His Spirit; and whosoever shall deny this cannot
rightly, I almost think, be reckoned in the number of any kind of
Christians at all.
