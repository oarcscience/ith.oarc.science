id="xvii.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35 \[XX.\]—Conclusion.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxxv-p2"></span>As for this present treatise, which I
have thought it proper to address to no other person in preference to
yourself, who have taken a kindly and true interest both in our common
faith and my character, as a true catholic and a good friend, you will
give it to be read or copied by any persons you may be able to find
interested in the subject, or may deem worthy to be trusted. In it I
have thought proper to repress and confute the presumption of this young
man, in such a way, however, as to show that I love him, wishing him to
be amended rather than condemned, and to make such progress in the great
house which is the catholic Church, whither the divine compassion has
conducted him, that he may be therein “a vessel unto honour, sanctified,
and meet for the Master’s use, and prepared unto every good work,” <span
id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) both by holy living and sound
teaching. But I have this further to say: if it behoves me to bestow my
love upon him, as I sincerely do, how much more ought I to love you, my
brother, whose affection towards me and whose catholic faith I have
found by the best of proofs to be cautious and sober! The result of your
loyalty has been, that you have, with a brother’s real love and duty,
taken care to have the books, which displeased you, and wherein you
found my name treated in a way which ran counter to your liking, copied
out and forwarded to me. Now, I am so far from feeling offended at this
charitable act of yours, because you did it, that I think I should have
had a right, on the true claims of friendship, to have been angry with
you if you had not done it. I therefore give you my most earnest thanks.
Moreover, I have afforded a still plainer indication of the spirit in
which I have accepted your service, by instantly composing this treatise
for your consideration, as soon as I had read those books of his.
