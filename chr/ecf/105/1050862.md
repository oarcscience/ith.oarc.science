<span id="xviii.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—God’s Agency is Needful Even in
Man’s Doings.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xx-p2"></span>For as it is said, “It is man’s part to
prepare his heart, and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord;” so
also is it said, “Open thy mouth, and I will fill it.” <span
id="fr_2660"></span>[2661](#fn_2660) For although, save by His
assistance without whom we can do nothing, we cannot open our mouth, yet
we open it by His aid and by our own agency, while the Lord fills it
without our agency. For what is to prepare the heart and to open the
mouth, but to prepare the will? And yet in the same scriptures is read,
“The will is prepared by the Lord,” <span
id="fr_2661"></span>[2662](#fn_2661) and, “Thou shalt open my lips, and
my mouth shall show forth Thy praise.” <span
id="fr_2662"></span>[2663](#fn_2662) So God admonishes us to prepare our
will in what we read,” It is man’s part to prepare his heart;” and yet,
that man may do this, God helps him, because the will is prepared by the
Lord. And,” Open thy mouth.” This He so says by way of command, as that
nobody can do this unless it is done by His aid, to whom it is said,
“Thou shalt open my lips.” Are any of these men so foolish as to contend
that the mouth is one thing, the lips another; and to say with
marvellous triviality that man opens his own mouth, and God opens man’s
lips? And yet God restrains them from even that absurdity where He says
to Moses His servant, “I will open thy mouth, and I will instruct thee
what thou oughtest to speak.” <span id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663)
In that clause, therefore, where He says, “Open thy mouth and I will
fill it,” it seems, as it were, that one of them pertains to man, the
other to God. But in this, where it is said, “I will open thy mouth and
will instruct thee,” both belong to God. Why is this, except that in one
of these cases He co-operates with man as the agent, in the other He
does it alone?
