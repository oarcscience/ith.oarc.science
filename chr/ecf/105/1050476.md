id="xv.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[XX.\]—Love the Root of All Good
Things; Cupidity, of All Evil Ones.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxi-p2"></span>The “capacity,” then, of which we speak
is not (as he supposes) the one identical root both of good things and
evil. For the love which is the root of good things is quite different
from the cupidity which is the root of evil things—as different, indeed,
as virtue is from vice. But without doubt this “capacity” is capable of
either root: because a man is not only able to possess love, whereby the
tree becomes a good one; but he is likewise able to have cupidity, which
makes the tree evil. This human cupidity, however, which is a vice, has
for its author man, or man’s deceiver, but not man’s Creator. It is
indeed that “lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride
of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world.” <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830) And who can be ignorant of the
usage of the Scripture, which under the designation of “*the world*” is
accustomed to describe those who inhabit the world?
