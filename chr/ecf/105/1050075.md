<span id="x.iii.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 57 \[XXIX.\]—The Good of Marriage;
Four Different Cases of the Good and the Evil Use of Matrimony.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lvii-p2"></span>The good, then, of marriage lies not in
the passion of desire, but in a certain legitimate and honourable
measure in using that passion, appropriate to the propagation of
children, not the gratification of lust. <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409) That, therefore, which is
disobediently excited in the members of the body of this death, and
endeavours to draw into itself our whole fallen soul, (neither arising
nor subsiding at the bidding of the mind), is that evil of sin in which
every man is born. When, however, it is curbed from unlawful desires,
and is permitted only for the orderly propagation and renewal of the
human race, this is the good of wedlock, by which man is born in the
union that is appointed. Nobody, however, is born again in Christ’s
body, unless he be previously born in the body of sin. But inasmuch as
it is evil to make a bad use of a good thing, so is it good to use well
a bad thing. These two ideas therefore of *good* and *evil*, and those
other two of a *good use* and an *evil use*, when they are duly combined
together, produce four different conditions:—\[1\] A man makes a good
use of a good thing, when he dedicates his continence to God; \[2.\] He
makes a bad use of a good thing, when he dedicates his continence to an
idol; \[3.\] He makes a bad use of an evil thing, when he loosely
gratifies his concupiscence by adultery; \[4.\] He makes a good use of
an evil thing, when he restrains his concupiscence by matrimony. Now, as
it is better to make good use of a good thing than to make good rise of
an evil thing,—since both are good,—so “he that giveth his virgin in
marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth
better.”  <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410) This question, indeed,
I have treated at greater length, and more sufficiently, as God enabled
me according to my humble abilities, in two works of mine,—one of them,
On the Good of Marriage, and the other, On Holy Virginity. They,
therefore, who extol the flesh and blood of a sinful creature, to the
prejudice of the Redeemer’s flesh and blood, must not defend the evil of
concupiscence through the good of marriage; nor should they, from whose
infant age the Lord has inculcated in us a lesson of humility, <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411) be lifted up into pride by the error
of others. He only was born without sin whom a virgin conceived without
the embrace of a husband,—not by the concupiscence of the flesh, but by
the chaste submission of her mind. <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412) She alone was able to give birth to
One who should heal our wound, who brought forth the germ of a pure
offspring without the wound of sin.
