id="xviii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Why the Passage Referred to
Must Be Understood of a Man Established Under Grace.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxii-p2"></span>And it had once appeared to me also
that the apostle was in this argument of his describing a man under the
law. <span id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581.md) But afterwards I was
constrained to give up the idea by those words where he says, “Now,
then, it is no more I that do it.” For to this belongs what he says
subsequently also: “There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them
that are in Christ Jesus.” And because I do not see how a man under the
law should say, “I delight in the law of God after the inward man;”
since this very delight in good, by which, moreover, he does not consent
to evil, not from fear of penalty, but from love of righteousness (for
this is meant by “delighting”), can only be attributed to grace.
