<span id="xii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—The Occasion of Publishing This
Work; What God’s Righteousness is.</span>

<span id="xii.v-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xii.v-p2.1"></span>The</span> book which you sent to me, my beloved
sons, Timasius and Jacobus, I have read through hastily, but not
indifferently, omitting only the few points which are plain enough to
everybody; and I saw in it a man inflamed with most ardent zeal against
those, who, when in their sins they ought to censure human will, are
more forward in accusing the nature of men, and thereby endeavour to
excuse themselves. He shows too great a fire against this evil, which
even authors of secular literature have severely censured with the
exclamation: “The human race falsely complains of its own nature!” <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123) This same sentiment your author
also has strongly insisted upon, with all the powers of his talent. I
fear, however, that he will chiefly help those “who have a zeal for God,
but not according to knowledge,” who, “being ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124) Now, what the righteousness of God
is, which is spoken of here, he immediately afterwards explains by
adding: “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believeth.” <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125) This
righteousness of God, therefore, lies not in the commandment of the law,
which excites fear, but in the aid afforded by the grace of Christ,
<span id="page_122">p. 122</span> <span id="xii.v-Page_122"></span>to
which alone the fear of the law, as of a schoolmaster, <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126) usefully conducts. Now, the man who
understands this understands why he is a Christian. For “If
righteousness came by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.” <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127) If, however He did not die in vain,
in Him only is the ungodly man justified, and to him, on believing in
Him who justifies the ungodly, faith is reckoned for
righteousness. <span id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128) For all men
have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely
by His blood. <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129) But all those
who do not think themselves to belong to the “all who have sinned and
fall short of the glory of God,” have of course no need to become
Christians, because “they that be whole need not a physician, but they
that are sick;” <span id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130) whence it is,
that He came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131)
