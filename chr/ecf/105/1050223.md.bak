<span id="xi.l-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 47 \[XXVII.\]—The Law “Being Done by
Nature” Means, Done by Nature as Restored by Grace.</span>

<span id="xi.l-p2"></span>Nor ought it to disturb us that the apostle
described them as doing that which is contained in the law “*by
nature,*”—not by the Spirit of God, not by faith, not by grace. For it
is the Spirit of grace that does it, in order to restore in us the image
of God, in which we were naturally created. <span
id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md) Sin, indeed, is contrary to nature,
and it is grace that heals it,—on which account the prayer is offered to
God, “Be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against
Thee.” <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) Therefore it is by nature
that men do the things which are contained in the law; <span
id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md) for they who do not, fail to do so by
reason of their sinful defect. In consequence of this sinfulness, the
law of God is erased out of their hearts; and therefore, when, the sin
being healed, it is written there, the prescriptions of the law are done
“*by nature,*”—not that by nature grace is denied, but rather by grace
nature is repaired. For “by one man sin entered into the world, and
death by sin, and so death passed upon all men; in which all have
sinned;”  <span id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) wherefore “there is no
difference: they all come short of the glory of God, being justified
freely by His grace.” <span id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) By this
grace there is written on the renewed inner man that righteousness which
sin had blotted out; and this mercy comes upon the human race through
our Lord Jesus Christ. “For there is one God, and one Mediator between
God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.” <span
