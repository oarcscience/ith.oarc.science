<span id="xiv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—The Same Continued.</span>

<span id="xiv.xv-p2"></span>But how this judgment is to be accomplished,
it is not easy to understand from Holy Scripture; for there are many
modes therein of describing that which is to come to pass only in one
mode. In one place the Lord declares that He will “shut the door”
against those whom He does not admit into His kingdom; and that, on
their clamorously demanding admission, “Open unto us, . . . we have
eaten and drunk in Thy presence,” and so forth, as the Scripture
describes, “He will say unto them in answer, I know you not, . . . all
ye workers of iniquity.” <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) In
another passage He reminds us that He will command “all which would not
that He should reign over them to be brought to Him, and be slain in His
presence.” <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) In another place,
again, He tells us that He will come with His angels in His majesty; and
before Him shall be gathered all nations, and He shall separate them one
from another; some He will set on His right hand, and after enumerating
their good works, will award to them eternal life; and others on His
left hand, whose barrenness in all good works He will expose, will He
condemn to everlasting fire. <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md)
In two other passages He deals with that wicked and slothful servant,
who neglected to trade with His money, <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) and with the man who was found at
the feast without the wedding garment,—and He orders them to be bound
hand and foot, and to be cast into outer darkness. <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) And in yet another scripture, after
admitting the five virgins who were wise, He shuts the door against the
other five foolish ones. <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) Now
these descriptions,—and there are others which at the instant do not
occur to me,—are all intended to represent to us the future judgment,
which of course will be held not over one, or over five, but over
multitudes. For if it were a solitary case only of the man who was cast
into outer darkness for not having on the wedding garment, He would not
have gone on at once to give it a plural turn, by saying: “For many are
called, but few are chosen;”  <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md)
whereas it is plain that, after the one was cast out and condemned, many
still remained behind in the house. However, <span id="page_188">p.
188</span> <span id="xiv.xv-Page_188"></span>it would occupy us too long
to discuss all these questions to the full. This brief remark, however,
I may make, without prejudice (as they say in pecuniary affairs) to some
better discussion, that by the many descriptions which are scattered
throughout the Holy Scriptures there is signified to us but one mode of
final judgment, which is inscrutable to us,—with only the variety of
deservings preserved in the rewards and punishments. Touching the
particular point, indeed, which we have before us at present, it is
sufficient to remark that, if Pelagius had actually said that all
sinners whatever without exception would be punished in an eternity of
punishment by everlasting fire, then whosoever had approved of this
judgment would, to begin with, have brought the sentence down on his own
head. “For who will boast that he is pure from sins?” <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) Forasmuch, however, as he did not
say *all*, nor *certain*, but made an indefinite statement only,—and
afterwards, in explanation, declared that his meaning was according to
the words of the Gospel,—his opinion was affirmed by the judgment of the
bishops to be true; but it does not even now appear what Pelagius really
thinks on the subject, and in consequence there is no indecency in
inquiring further into the decision of the episcopal judges.
