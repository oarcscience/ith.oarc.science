id="xviii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 \[II.\]—The Calumny of
Julian,—That the Catholics Teach that Free Will is Taken Away by Adam’s
Sin.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.iv-p2"></span>Let us now, therefore, reply to
Julian’s letter. “Those Manicheans say,” says he, “with whom now we do
not communicate,—that is, the whole of them with whom we differ,—that by
the sin of the first man, that is, of Adam, free will perished: and that
no one has now the power of living well, but that all are constrained
into sin by the necessity of their flesh.” He calls the catholics
Manicheans, after the manner of that Jovinian who a few years ago, as a
new heretic, destroyed the virginity of the blessed Mary, and placed the
marriage of the faithful on the same level with her sacred virginity.
And he did not object this to the catholics on any other ground than
that he wished them to seem to be either accusers or condemners of
marriage.
