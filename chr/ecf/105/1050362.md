id="xiii.xxx-p1.1"></span>(26.) Why Job Was So Great a Sufferer.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxx-p2"></span>And when he says concerning the Lord, “For
many bruises hath He inflicted upon me without a cause,” <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) observe that his words are not, He
hath inflicted *none with a cause*; but, “many without a cause.” For it
was not because of his manifold sins that these many bruises were
inflicted on him, but in order to make trial of his patience. For on
account of his sins, indeed, without which, as he acknowledges in
another passage, he was certainly not, he yet judges that he ought to
have suffered less. <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469)
