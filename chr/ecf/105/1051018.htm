<p class="c46"><a name="xx.xxxvii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xx.xxxvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 34.&#8212;The Aid Without Which a Thing Does Not Come to Pass, and the Aid with Which a Thing Comes to Pass.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xx.xxxvii-p2"></A>Moreover, the aids themselves are to be distinguished. The aid without which a thing does not come to pass is one thing, and the aid by which a thing comes to pass is another. For without food we cannot live; and yet although food should be at hand, it would not cause a man to live who should will to die. Therefore the aid of food is that without which it does not come to pass that we live, not that by which it comes to pass that we live. But, indeed, when the blessedness which a man has not is given him, he becomes at once blessed. For the aid is not only that without which that does not happen, but also with which that does happen for the sake of which it is given. Wherefore this is an assistance both by which it comes to pass, and without which it does not come to pass; because, on the one hand, if blessedness should be given to a man, he becomes at once blessed; and, on the other, if it should never be given he will never be so. But food does not of necessity cause a man to live, and yet without it he cannot live. Therefore to the first man, who, in that good in which he had been made upright, had received the ability not to sin, the ability not to die, the ability not to forsake that good itself, was given the aid of perseverance,&#8212;not that by which it should be brought about that he should persevere, but that without which he could not of free will persevere. But now to the saints predestinated to the kingdom of God by God&#146;s grace, the aid of perseverance that is given is not such as the former, but such that to them perseverance itself is bestowed; not only so that without that gift they cannot persevere, but, moreover, so that by means of this gift they cannot help persevering. For not only did He say, &#8220;Without me ye can do nothing,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3355"></A><A HREF="#fn_3355"><FONT SIZE="1">3356</FONT></A>
 but He also said, &#8220;Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3356"></A><A HREF="#fn_3356"><FONT SIZE="1">3357</FONT></A>
 By which words He showed that He had given them not only righteousness, but perseverance therein. For when Christ thus ordained them that they should go and bring forth fruit, and that their <A NAME="page_486"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 486</FONT></A> <a name="xx.xxxvii-Page_486"></A>fruit should remain, who would dare to say, It shall not remain? Who would dare to say, Perchance it will not remain? &#8220;For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3357"></A><A HREF="#fn_3357"><FONT SIZE="1">3358</FONT></A>
 but the calling is of those who are called according to the purpose. When Christ intercedes, therefore, on behalf of these, that their faith should not fail, doubtless it will not fail unto the end. And thus it shall persevere even unto the end; nor shall the end of this life find it anything but continuing.</p>
