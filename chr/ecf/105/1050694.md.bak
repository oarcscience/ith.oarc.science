id="xvii.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Victor’s Third
Quotation.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxii-p2"></span>He proceeds to favour us with a third
passage, in which it is written: “Who forms the spirit of man within
him.” <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) As if any one denied
this! No; all our question is as to the *mode* of the formation. Now let
us take the eye of the body, and ask, who but God forms it? I suppose
that He forms it not externally, but in itself, and yet, most certainly,
by propagation. Since, then, He also forms “the human spirit in him,”
the question still remains, whether it be derived by a fresh
insufflation in every instance, or by propagation.
