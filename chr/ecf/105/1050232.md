<span id="xi.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56.—The Faith of Those Who are Under the
Law Different from the Faith of Others.</span>

<span id="xi.lix-p2"></span>But there is yet another distinction to be
observed,—since they who are under the law both attempt to work their
own righteousness through fear of punishment, and fail to do God’s
righteousness, because this is accomplished by the love to which only
what is lawful is pleasing, and never by the fear which is forced to
have in its work the thing which is lawful, although it has something
else in its will which would prefer, if it were only possible, that to
be lawful <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="xi.lix-Page_108"></span>which is not lawful. These persons also
believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would
they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however,
is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: “Ye have not
received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the
spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.” <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018) The fear, then, of which we speak
is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the
Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared.
God’s children, however, exclaim, “Abba, Father,”—one of which words
they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the
uncircumcision,—the Jew first, and then the Greek; <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019) since there is “one God, which
justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through
faith.” <span id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020) When indeed they
utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that
which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but that which
is said of them, “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
righteousness, for they shall be filled?” <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021) Let, then, those who are under the
law pass over hither, and become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so
as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they are sons, still to serve
their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the
Only-begotten “gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them
that believe on His name;” <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022)
and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive,
to find, and to have the gate opened to them, <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023) adding by way of rebuke, the words
: “If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them
that ask Him?” <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024) When,
therefore, that strength of sin, the law, <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025) inflamed the sting of death, even
sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of
concupiscence in them, <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1027](#fn_1026) of
whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows
how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his
folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the
gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself. <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027) Why, then, does he not listen to
the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ’s apostle, or even
Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, “Seek and ye shall find;” <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028) and who also says to us, speaking
by His apostle: “If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given
to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering?” <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029) This is the faith by which the just
man lives; <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030) this is the faith
whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly; <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031) this is the faith through which
boasting is excluded, <span id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032) either
by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the
rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the
faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is
said: “We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
by faith.” <span id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033) But this admits of
the further question, Whether he meant by “the hope of righteousness”
that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is
itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes
undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and
thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the
inward man day by day, <span id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034) and
hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be
realized that which is said of God by the psalm: “Who satisfieth thy
desire with good things.” <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035)
This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said:
“By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is
the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath
before ordained that we should walk in them.” <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036) This, in short, is the faith which
works not by fear, but by love; <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037) not by dreading punishment, but by
loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,—that is to
say, this charity,—by which faith works, if not from the source whence
faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent
soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy
Ghost who is given to us. <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038) Now
“*the love of God*” is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because
He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as “*the
righteousness of God*” <span id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039) is
used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and “*the
salvation of the Lord*,” <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040) in
that we are saved by Him; and “*the faith of Jesus Christ*,” <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041) because He makes us believers in
Him. This is that righteousness of God, which He not only teaches us by
the precept of His law, but also bestows upon us by the gift of His
Spirit.
