id="x.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—Introductory, in the Shape of
an Inscription to His Friend Marcellinus.</span>

<span id="x.iii.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="x.iii.i-p2.1"></span>However</span>absorbing and intense the
anxieties and annoyances in the whirl and warmth of which we are engaged
with sinful men <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) who forsake the
law of God,—even though we may well ascribe these very evils to the
fault of our own sins,—I am unwilling, and, to say the truth, unable,
any longer to remain a debtor, my dearest Marcellinus, <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) to that zealous affection of yours,
which only enhances my own grateful and pleasant estimate of yourself. I
am under the impulse \[of a twofold emotion\]: on the one hand, there is
that very love which makes us unchangeably one in the one hope of a
change for the better; on the other hand, there is the fear of offending
God in yourself, who has given you so earnest a desire; in gratifying
which I shall be only serving Him who has given it to you. And so
strongly has this impulse led and attracted me to solve, to the best of
my humble ability, the questions which you have submitted to me in
writing, that my mind has gradually admitted this inquiry to an
importance transcending that of all others; \[and it will now give me no
rest\] until I accomplish something which shall make it manifest that I
have yielded, if not a sufficient, yet at any rate an obedient,
compliance with your own kind wish and the desire of those to whom these
questions are a source of anxiety.

<span id="x.iii.i-p3"></span> This is probably an allusion to the
Donatists, who were then fiercely assailing the Catholics; \[and over
the conference between whom and the Catholics, Marcellinus had presided
the previous year (411).—W.\]

<span id="x.iii.i-p4"></span> \[Flavius Marcellinus, a “tribune and
notary,” a Christian man of high character and devout mind, who was much
interested in theological discussions. He was appointed by Honorius to
preside over the commission of inquiry into the disputes between the
Catholics and Donatists in 411, and held the famous conference between
the parties, that met in Carthage on the 1st, 3d, and 8th of June, 411.
He discharged this whole business with singular patience, moderation,
and good judgment; which appears to have cemented the intimate
friendship between him and Augustin. Augustin’s treatise on *The Spirit
and Letter* is also addressed to him, and he undertook the *City of God*
on his suggestion. See below, p. 80.—W.\]
