<span id="xii.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15 \[XIV.\]—Not Everything \[of
Doctrinal Truth\] is Written in Scripture in So Many Words.</span>

<span id="xii.xix-p2"></span>That, too, which is said to him, “that it
is nowhere written in so many words, A man can be without sin,” he
easily refutes thus: “That the question here is not in what precise
words each doctrinal statement is made.” It is perhaps not without
reason that, while in several passages of Scripture we may find it said
that men are without excuse, it is nowhere found that any man is
described as being without sin, except Him only, of whom it is plainly
said, that “He knew no sin.” <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md)
Similarly, we read in the passage where the subject is concerning
priests: “He was in all points tempted like as we are, only without
sin,” <span id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md) —meaning, of course, in
that flesh which bore the likeness of sinful flesh, although it was not
sinful flesh; a likeness, indeed, which it would not have borne if it
had not been in every other respect the same as sinful flesh. How,
however, we are to understand this: “Whosoever is born of God doth not
commit sin; neither can he sin, for his seed remaineth in him;” <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) while the Apostle John himself, as
if he had not been born of God, or else were addressing men who had not
been born of God, lays down this position: “If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,” <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md) —I have already explained, with
such care as I was able, in those books which I wrote to Marcellinus on
this very subject. <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159.md) It seems,
<span id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span
id="xii.xix-Page_126"></span>moreover, to me to be an interpretation
worthy of acceptance to regard the clause of the above quoted passage:
“Neither can he sin,” as if it meant: *He ought not to commit sin*. For
who could be so foolish as to say that sin ought to be committed, when,
in fact, sin is sin, for no other reason than that it ought not to be
committed?
