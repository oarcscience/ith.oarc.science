<span id="xv.iv.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46.—Difficulty of Believing Original
Sin. Man’s Vice is a Beast’s Nature.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xlvi-p2"></span>No one should feel surprise, and ask:
“Why does God’s goodness create anything for the devil’s malignity to
take possession of?” The truth is, God’s gift is bestowed on the seminal
elements of His creature with the same bounty wherewith “He maketh His
sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
and on the unjust.” <span id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) It is
with so large a bounty that God has blessed the very seeds, and by
blessing has constituted them. Nor has this blessing been eliminated out
of our excellent nature by a fault which puts us under condemnation.
Owing, indeed, to God’s justice, who punishes, this fatal flaw has so
far prevailed, that men are born with the fault of original sin; but yet
its influence has not extended so far as to stop the birth of men. Just
so does it happen in persons of adult age: whatever sins they commit, do
not eliminate his manhood from man; nay, God’s work continues still
good, however evil be the deeds of the impious. For although “man being
placed in honour abideth not; and being without understanding, is
compared with the beasts, and is like them,” <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) yet the resemblance is not so
absolute that he becomes a beast. There is a comparison, no doubt,
between the two; but it is not by reason of nature, but through vice—not
vice in the beast, but in nature. For so excellent is a man in
comparison with a beast, that man’s vice is beast’s nature; still man’s
nature is never on this account changed into beast’s nature. God,
therefore, condemns man because of the fault wherewithal his nature is
disgraced, and not because of his nature, which is not destroyed in
consequence of its fault. Heaven forbid that we should think beasts are
obnoxious to the sentence of condemnation! It is only proper that they
should be free from our misery, inasmuch as they cannot partake of our
blessedness. What, then, is there surprising or unjust in man’s being
subjected to an impure spirit—not on account of nature, but on account
of that impurity of his which he has contracted in the stain of his
birth, and which proceeds, not from the divine work, but from the will
of man;—since also the impure spirit itself is a good thing considered
as spirit, but evil in that it is impure? For the one is of God, and is
His work, while the other emanates from man’s own will. The stronger
nature, therefore, that is, the angelic one, keeps the lower, or human,
nature in subjection, by reason of the association of vice with the
latter. Accordingly the Mediator, who was stronger than the angels,
became weak for man’s sake.  <span id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md)
So that the pride of the Destroyer is destroyed by the humility of the
Redeemer; and he who makes his boast over the sons of men of his angelic
strength, is vanquished by the Son of God in the human weakness which He
assumed.
