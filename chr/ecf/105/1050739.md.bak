<span id="xvii.vi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[V.\]—Victor Apparently Gives
the Creative Breath to Man Also.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.vii-p2"></span>But what is the meaning of that, which
you have thought proper to add to this simile, with regard to the
example of the blessed Elisha because he raised the dead by breathing
into his face? <span id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md) Now, do you
really suppose that Elisha’s breath was made the soul of the child? I
could not believe that even you could stray so far away from the truth.
If, now, that soul which was taken from the living child so as to cause
his death, was itself afterwards restored to him so as to cause his
restoration to life: where, I ask, is the pertinence of your remark when
you say “that no diminution accrued to Elisha,” as if it could be
imagined that anything had been transferred from the prophet to the
child to cause his revival? But if you meant no more than that the
prophet breathed and remained entire, where was the necessity for your
saying that of Elisha, when raising the dead child, which you might with
no less propriety say of any one whatever when emitting a breath, and
reviving no one? Then, again, you spoke unadvisedly (though God forbid
that you should believe the breath of Elisha to have become the soul of
the resuscitated child!) when you intimated your meaning to be a desire
to keep separate what was first done by God from this that was done by
the prophet, in that the One breathed but once, and the other thrice.
These are your words: “Elisha breathed into the face of the deceased
child of the Shunammite, after the manner of the original creation. And
when by the prophet’s breathing a divine force inspired the dead limbs,
reanimated to their original vigour, no diminution accrued to Elisha,
through whose breathing the dead body recovered its revived soul and
spirit. Only there is this difference, the Lord breathed but once into
man’s face and he lived, while Elisha breathed three times into the face
of the dead and he lived again.” Thus your words sound as if the number
of the breathings alone made all the difference, why we should not
believe that the prophet actually did what God did. This statement,
then, requires to be entirely revised. There was so complete a
difference between that work of God and this of Elisha, that the former
breathed the breath of life whereby man became a living soul, and the
latter breathed a breath which was not itself sentient nor endued with
life, but was figurative for the sake of some signification. The prophet
did not really cause the child to live again by giving him life, but he
procured God’s doing that by giving him love. <span
id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) As to what you allege, that he
breathed three times, either your memory, as often happens, or a faulty
reading of the text, must have misled you. Why need I enlarge? You ought
not to be seeking for examples and arguments to establish your point,
but rather to amend and change your opinion. I beg of you neither to
believe, nor to say, nor to teach “that God made the human soul not out
of nothing, but out of His own substance,” if you wish to be a catholic.
