<span id="xii.lxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 67 \[LVII.\]—Who May Be Said to Be
Under the Law.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxi-p2"></span>But even our author should observe that it
is to persons who have been already baptized that it was said: “The
flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, so
that ye cannot do the things that ye would.” <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) And lest he should make them
slothful for the actual conflict, and should seem by this statement to
have given them laxity in sinning, he goes on to tell them: “If ye be
led of the Spirit, ye are no longer under the law.” <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) For that man is under the law, who,
from fear of the punishment which the law threatens, and not from any
love for <span id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span
id="xii.lxxi-Page_145"></span>righteousness, obliges himself to abstain
from the work of sin, without being as yet free and removed from the
desire of sinning. For it is in his very will that he is guilty, whereby
he would prefer, if it were possible, that what he dreads should not
exist, in order that he might freely do what he secretly desires.
Therefore he says, “If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the
law,”—even the law which inspires fear, but gives not love. For this
“love is shed abroad in our hearts,” not by the letter of the law, but
“by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) This is the law of liberty, not of
bondage; being the law of love, not of fear; and concerning it the
Apostle James says: “Whoso looketh into the perfect law of
liberty.” <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md) Whence he, too, no
longer indeed felt terrified by God’s law as a slave, but delighted in
it in the inward man, although still seeing another law in his members
warring against the law of his mind. Accordingly he here says: “If ye be
led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.” So far, indeed, as any man
is led by the Spirit, he is not under the law; because, so far as he
rejoices in the law of God, he lives not in fear of the law, since “fear
has torment,”  <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) not joy and
delight.
