<span id="xx.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—True Children of God are True
Disciples of Christ.</span>

<span id="xx.xxv-p2"></span>Finally, the Saviour Himself says, “If ye
continue in my word, ye are indeed my disciples.” <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318) Is Judas, then, to be reckoned
among them, since he did not continue in His word? Are they to be
reckoned among them of whom the gospel speaks in such wise, where, when
the Lord had commanded His flesh to be eaten and His blood to be drunk,
the Evangelist says, “These things said He in the synagogue as He taught
in Capernaum. Many, therefore, of His disciples, when they had heard
this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it? But Jesus, knowing
in Himself that His disciples were murmuring at it, said to them, Doth
this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascending where
He was before? It is the Spirit that quickeneth, but the flesh profiteth
nothing. The words that I have spoken unto you are spirit and life. But
there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning
who were the believing ones, and who should betray Him; and He said,
Therefore said I unto you, that no man cometh unto me except it were
given of my Father. From this time many of His disciples went away back
from Him, and no longer walked with Him.” <span
id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319) Are not these even in the words of
the gospel called disciples? And yet they were not truly disciples,
because they did not continue in His word, according to what He says:
“If ye continue in my word, then are ye indeed my disciples.” <span
id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320) Because, therefore, they possessed
not perseverance, as not being truly disciples of Christ, so they were
not truly children of God even when they appeared to be so, and were so
called. We, then, call men elected, and Christ’s disciples, and God’s
children, because they are to be so called whom, being regenerated, we
see to live piously; but they are then truly what they are called if
they shall abide in that on account of which they are so called. But if
they have not perseverance,—that is, if they continue not in that which
they have begun to be,—they are not truly called what they are called
and are not; for they are not this in the sight of Him to whom it is
known what they are going to be,—that is to say, from good men, bad men.
