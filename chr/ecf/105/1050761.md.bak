<span id="xvii.vii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[IV.\]—God Alone Can Teach Whence
Souls Come.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.v-p2"></span>Now with respect to the question between
us, I confess to your loving self <span
id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) I greatly desire to know one of two
things if I can,—either concerning the origin of souls, of which I am
ignorant, or whether this knowledge is within our reach so long as we
are in the present life. For what if our controversy touches the very
points of which it is enjoined to us, “Seek not out the things that are
too high for thee, neither search the things that are above thy
strength; but whatever things the Lord hath commanded and taught thee,
think thereupon for evermore.” <span
id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) This, then, is what I desire to
know, either from <span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.v-Page_356"></span>God Himself, who knows what He creates,
or even from some competently learned man who knows what he is saying,
not from a person who is ignorant of the breath he heaves. It is not
everybody who recollects his own infancy; and do you suppose that a man
is able, without divine instruction, to know whence he began to exist in
his mother’s womb,—especially if the knowledge of human nature has so
completely eluded him as to leave him ignorant, not only of what is
within him, but of that also which is added to his nature from without?
Will you, my dearest brother, be able to teach me, or any one else,
whence human beings at their birth are ensouled, <span
id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) when you still know not how it is
that their life is so sustained by food, that they are certain to die if
the aliment is withdrawn for a while? Or will you be able to teach me,
or any one else, whence men obtain their souls, when you are still
actually ignorant whence bags, when inflated, get the filling? My only
wish, as you are ignorant whence souls have their origin, is, that I may
on my side know whether such knowledge is attainable by me in this
present life. If this be one of the things which are too high for us,
and which we are forbidden to seek out or search into, then we have good
grounds for fearing lest we should sin, not by our ignorance of it, but
our quest after it. For we ought not to suppose that a subject, to fall
under the category of the things which are too high for us, must
appertain to the nature of God, and not to our own.
