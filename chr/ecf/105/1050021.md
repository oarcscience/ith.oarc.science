<span id="x.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[III.\]—It is One Thing to Be
Mortal, Another Thing to Be Subject to Death.</span>

<span id="x.iii.iii-p2"></span>Nor was there any reason to fear that if
he had happened to live on here longer in his natural body, he would
have been oppressed with old age, and have gradually, by increasing age,
arrived at death. For if God granted to the clothes and the shoes of the
Israelites that “they waxed not old” during so many years, <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215) what wonder if for obedience it had
been by the power of the same \[God\] allowed to man, that although he
had a natural and mortal body, he should have in it a certain condition,
in which he might grow full of years without decrepitude, and, whenever
God pleased, pass from mortality to immortality without the medium of
death? For even as this very flesh of ours, which we now possess, is not
therefore invulnerable, because it is not necessary that it should be
wounded; so also was his not therefore immortal, because there was no
necessity for its dying. Such a condition, whilst still in their natural
and mortal body, I suppose, was granted even to those who were
translated hence without death. <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216)
For Enoch and Elijah were not reduced to the decrepitude of old age by
their long life. But yet I do not believe that they were then changed
into that spiritual kind of body, such as is promised in the
resurrection, and which the Lord was the first to receive; only they
probably do not need those aliments, which by their use minister
refreshment to the body; but ever since their translation they so live,
as to enjoy such a sufficiency as was provided during the forty days in
which Elijah lived on the cruse of water and the cake, without
substantial food; <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217) or else, if
there be any need of such sustenance, they are, it may be, sustained in
Paradise in some such way as Adam was, before he brought on himself
expulsion therefrom by sinning. And he, as I suppose, was supplied with
sustenance against decay from the fruit of the various trees, and from
the tree of life with security against old age.
