id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617) —Guilt May Be Taken Away But
Concupiscence Remain.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xlvi-p3"></span>You must not be surprised at what I have
said, that although the law of sin remains with its concupiscence, the
guilt thereof is done away through the grace of the sacrament. For as
wicked deeds, and words, and thoughts have already passed away, and
cease to exist, so far as regards the mere movements of the mind and the
body, and yet their guilt remains after they have passed away and no
longer exist, unless it be done away by the remission of sins; so,
contrariwise, in this law of concupiscence, which is not yet done away
but still remains, its guilt is done away, and continues no longer,
since in baptism there takes place a full forgiveness of sins. Indeed,
if a man were to quit this present life immediately after his baptism,
there would be nothing at all left to hold him liable, inasmuch as all
which held him is released. As, on the one hand, therefore, there is
nothing strange in the fact that the guilt of past sins of thought, and
word, and deed remains before their remission; so, on the other hand,
there ought to be nothing to create surprise, that the guilt of
remaining concupiscence passes away after the remission of sin.
