id="xvii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Victor Utterly Unable to Explain
How the Sinless Soul Deserved to Be Made Sinful.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.ix-p2"></span>But what does he mean by that, which in
his introduction he says has befallen him? For previous to proposing
that question of his, and as introducing it, he affirms: “There are
other opprobrious expressions underlying the querulous murmurings of
those who rail at us; and, shaken about as in a hurricane, we are again
and again dashed amongst enormous rocks.” Now, if I were to express
myself about him in this style, he would probably be angry. The words
are his; and after premising them, he propounded his question, by way of
showing us the very rocks against which he struck and was wrecked. For
to such lengths was he carried, and against such frightful reefs was he
borne, drifted, and struck, that his escape was a perfect impossibility
without a retreat—a correction, in short, of what he had said; since he
was unable to show by what desert the soul was made sinful; though he
was not afraid to say, that previous to any sin of its own it had
deserved to become sinful. Now, who deserves, without committing any
sin, so immense a punishment as to be conceived in the sin of another,
before leaving his mother’s womb, and then to be no longer free from
sin? But from this punishment the free grace of God delivers the souls
of such infants as are regenerated in Christ, with no previous merits of
their own—otherwise grace is no grace.” <span
id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) With regard, then, to this person,
who is so vastly intelligent, and who in the great depth of his wisdom
is displeased at our hesitation, which, if not well informed, is at all
events circumspect, let him tell us, if he can, what the merit was which
brought the soul into such a punishment, from which grace delivers it
without any merit. Let him speak, and, if he can, defend his assertion
with some show of reason. I would not, indeed, require so much of him,
if he had not himself declared that the soul deserved to become sinful.
Let him tell us what the desert was—whether good desert or evil? If
good, how could well-deserving lead to evil? If evil, whence could arise
any ill desert previous to the commission of any sin? I have also to
remark, that if there be a good desert, then the liberation of the soul
would not be of free grace, but it would be due to the previous merit,
and thus “grace would be no more grace.” If there be, however, an evil
desert, then I ask what it is. Is it true that the soul has come into
the flesh; and that it would not have so come unless He in whom there is
no sin had Himself sent it? Never, therefore, except by floundering
worse and worse, will he contrive to set up this view of his, in which
he predicates of the soul that it deserved to be sinful. In the case of
those infants, too, in whose baptism original sin is washed away, he
found something to say after a fashion,—to the effect, that being
involved in the sin of another could not possibly have been detrimental
to them, predestinated as they were to eternal life in the foreknowledge
of God. This might admit of a tolerably good sense, if he had not
entangled himself in that formula of his, in which he asserts that the
soul deserved to be sinful: from this difficulty he can only extricate
himself by revoking his words, with regret at having expressed them.
