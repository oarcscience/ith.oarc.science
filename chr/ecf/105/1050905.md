<span id="xviii.vi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[VI.\]—Of the Praise of Free
Will.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xii-p2"></span>Moreover, that, in opposition to the
Manicheans, they praise free will, making use of the prophetic
testimony, “If ye shall be willing and will hear me, ye shall eat what
is good in the land; but if ye shall be unwilling and will not hear me,
the sword shall consume you:” <span id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808.md)
what advantage is this to them, when, indeed, it is not so much against
the Manicheans that they are maintaining, as against the catholics that
they are extolling, free will? For they wish what is said, “If ye be
willing and will hear me,” to be so understood, as if in the preceding
will <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="xviii.vi.xii-Page_422"></span>itself were the merit of the grace
that follows; and thus grace were no more grace, seeing that it is not
free when it is rendered as a debt. But if they should so understand
what is written, “If ye be willing,” as to confess that He prepares even
that good will itself of whom it is written, “The will is prepared by
the Lord,” <span id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809.md) they would use
this testimony as catholics, and not only would overcome the ancient
heresy of the Manicheans, but would not found the new one of the
Pelagians.
