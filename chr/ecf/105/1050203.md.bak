<span id="xi.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27 \[XV.\]—Grace, Concealed in the Old
Testament, is Revealed in the New.</span>

<span id="xi.xxx-p2"></span>This grace hid itself under a veil in the
Old Testament, but it has been revealed in the New Testament according
to the most perfectly ordered dispensation of the ages, forasmuch as God
knew how to dispose all things. And perhaps it is a part of this hiding
of grace, that in the Decalogue, which was given on Mount Sinai, only
the portion which relates to the Sabbath was hidden under a prefiguring
precept. The Sabbath is a day of sanctification; and it is not without
significance that, among all the works which God accomplished, the first
sound of sanctification was heard on the day when He rested from all His
labours. On this, indeed, we must not now enlarge. But at the same time
I deem it to be enough for the point now in question, that it was not
for nothing that the nation was commanded on that day to abstain from
all servile work, by which sin is signified; but because not to commit
sin belongs to sanctification, that is, to God’s gift through the Holy
Spirit. And this precept alone among the others, was placed in the law,
which was written on the two tables of stone, in a prefiguring shadow,
under which the Jews observe the Sabbath, that by this very circumstance
it might be signified that it was then the time for concealing the
grace, which had to be revealed in the New Testament by the death of
Christ,—the rending, as it were, of the veil. <span

shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.” <span
