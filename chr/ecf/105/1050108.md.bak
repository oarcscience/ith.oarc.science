<span id="x.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Zacharias and Elisabeth,
Sinners.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xix-p2"></span>Now what must we say of Zacharias and
Elisabeth, who are often alleged against us in discussions on this
question, except that there is clear evidence in the Scripture <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) that Zacharias was a man of eminent
righteousness among the chief priests, whose duty it was to offer up the
sacrifices of the Old Testament? We also read, however, in the Epistle
to the Hebrews, in a passage which I have already quoted in my previous
book, <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) that Christ was the only
High Priest who had no need, as those who were called high priests, to
offer daily a sacrifice for his own sins first, and then for the people.
“For such a High Priest,” it says, “became us, righteous, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; who
needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first
for his own sins.” <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) Amongst the
priests here referred to was Zacharias, amongst them was Phinehas, yea,
Aaron himself, from whom this priesthood had its beginning, and whatever
others there were who lived laudably and righteously in this priesthood;
and yet all these were under the necessity, first of all, of offering
sacrifice for their own sins,—Christ, of whose future coming they were a
type, being the only one who, as an incontaminable priest, had no such
necessity.
