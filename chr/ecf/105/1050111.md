<span id="x.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22 \[XV.\]—An Objection of the
Pelagians; Perfection is Relative; He is Rightly Said to Be Perfect in
Righteousness Who Has Made Much Progress Therein.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxii-p2"></span>“Well, but,” they say, “the Lord says,
‘Be ye perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,’ <span
id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546) —an injunction which He would not have
given, if He had known that what He enjoined was impracticable.” Now the
present question is not whether it be possible for any men, during this
present life, to be without sin if they receive that perfection for the
purpose; for the question of possibility we have already
discussed: <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547) —but what we have now
to consider is, whether any man in fact achieves perfection. We have,
however, already recognised the fact that no man wills as much as the
duty demands, as also the testimony of the Scriptures, which we have
quoted so largely above, declares. When, indeed, perfection is ascribed
to any particular person, we must look carefully at the thing in which
it is ascribed. For I have just above quoted a passage of the apostle,
wherein he confesses that he was not yet perfect in the attainment of
righteousness which he desired; but still he immediately adds, “Let as
many of us as are perfect be thus minded.” Now he would certainly not
have uttered these two sentences if he had not been perfect in one
thing, and not in another. For instance, a man may be perfect as a
scholar in the pursuit of wisdom: and this could not yet be said of
those to whom \[the apostle\] said, “I have fed you with milk, and not
with meat: for hitherto ye have not been able to bear it, neither are ye
yet able;” <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548) whereas to those of
whom it could be said he says, “Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that
are perfect,”—meaning, of course, “perfect pupils” to be understood. It
may happen, therefore, as I have said, that a man may be already perfect
as a scholar, though not as yet perfect as a teacher of wisdom; may be
perfect as a learner, though not as yet perfect as a doer of
righteousness; may be perfect as a lover of his enemies, though not as
yet perfect in bearing their wrong.  <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549) Even in the case of him who is so far
perfect as to love all men, inasmuch as he has attained even to the love
of his enemies, it still remains a question whether he be perfect in
that love,—in other words, whether he so loves those whom he loves as is
prescribed to be exercised towards those to be loved, by the
unchangeable love of truth. Whenever, then, we read in the Scriptures of
any man’s perfection, it must be carefully considered in what it is
asserted, since a man is not therefore to be understood as being
entirely without sin because he is described as perfect in some
particular thing; although the term may also be employed to show, not,
indeed, that there is no longer any point left for a man to reach his
way to perfection, but that he has in fact advanced a very great way,
and on that account may be deemed worthy of the designation. Thus, a man
may be said to be perfect in the science of the law, even if there be
still something unknown to him; and in the same manner the apostle
called men perfect, to whom he said at the same time, “Yet if in
anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.
Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same
rule.” <span id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550)
