<span id="xvi.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20 \[XVIII\]—Why Children of Wrath are
Born of Holy Matrimony.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xx-p2"></span>This is the reason, indeed, why of even
the just and lawful marriages of the children of God are born, not
children of God, but children of the world; because also those who
generate, if they are already regenerate, beget children not as
chil<span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="xvi.v.xx-Page_272"></span>dren of God, but as still children of the
world. “The children of this world,” says our Lord, “beget and are
begotten.” <span id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131) From the fact,
therefore, that we are still children of this world, our outer man is in
a state of corruption; and on this account our offspring are born as
children of the present world; nor do they become sons of God, except
they be regenerated. <span id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132) Yet
inasmuch as we are children of God, our inner man is renewed from day to
day. <span id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133) And yet even our outer
man has been sanctified through the laver of regeneration, and has
received the hope of future incorruption, on which account it is justly
designated as “the temple of God.” “Your bodies,” says the apostle, “are
the temples of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, and which ye have of
God; and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a great price:
therefore glorify and carry God in your body.” <span
id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134) The whole of this statement is made
in reference to our present sanctification, but especially in
consequence of that hope of which he says in another passage, “We
ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we
ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
redemption of our body.” <span id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135) If,
then, the redemption of our body is expected, as the apostle declares,
it follows, that being an expectation, it is as yet a matter of hope,
and not of actual possession. Accordingly the apostle adds: “For we are
saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth,
why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we
with patience wait for it.” <span id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136)
Not, therefore, by that which we are waiting for, but by that which we
are now enduring, are the children of our flesh born. God forbid that a
man who possesses faith should, when he hears the apostle bid men “love
their wives,” <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137) love that
carnal concupiscence in his wife which he ought not to love even in
himself; as he may know, if he listens to the words of another apostle:
“Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that
is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and
the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the
world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of
God abideth for ever, even as also God abideth for ever.” <span
id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138)
