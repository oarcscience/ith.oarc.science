<span id="xix.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[VII.\]—Paul Fought, But God
Gave the Victory: He Ran, But God Showed Mercy.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xvi-p2"></span>Let us, therefore, consider those very
merits of the Apostle Paul which he said the Righteous Judge would
recompense with the crown of righteousness; and let us see whether these
merits of his were really his own—I mean, whether they were obtained by
him of himself, or were the gifts of God. “I have fought,” says he, “the
good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith.” <span
id="fr_3038"></span>[3039](#fn_3038.md) Now, in the first place, these good
works were nothing, unless they had been preceded by good thoughts.
Observe, therefore, what he says concerning these very thoughts. His
words, when writing to the Corinthians, are: “Not that we are sufficient
of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is
of God.” <span id="fr_3039"></span>[3040](#fn_3039.md) Then let us look at
each several merit. “I have fought the good fight.” Well, now, I want to
know by what power he fought. Was it by a power which he possessed of
himself, or by strength given to him from above? It is impossible to
suppose that so great a teacher as the apostle was ignorant of the law
of God, which proclaims the following in Deuteronomy: “Say not in thine
heart, My own strength and energy of hand hath wrought for me this great
power; but thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, how it is He that
giveth thee strength to acquire such power.” <span
id="fr_3040"></span>[3041](#fn_3040.md) And what avails “the good fight,”
unless followed by victory? And who gives the victory but He of whom the
apostle says himself, “Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ”? <span
id="fr_3041"></span>[3042](#fn_3041.md) Then, in another passage, having
quoted from the Psalm these words: “Because for Thy sake we are killed
all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for slaughter,” <span
id="fr_3042"></span>[3043](#fn_3042.md) he went on to declare: “Nay, in all
these things we are more than conquerors, through Him that loved
us.” <span id="fr_3043"></span>[3044](#fn_3043.md) Not by ourselves,
therefore, is the victory accomplished, but by Him who hath loved us. In
the second clause he says, “I have finished my course.” Now, who is it
that says this, but he who declares in another passage, “So then it is
not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that
showeth mercy.” <span id="fr_3044"></span>[3045](#fn_3044.md) And this
sentence can by no means be transposed, so that it could be said: It is
not of God, who showeth mercy, but of the man who willeth and runneth.
If any person be bold enough to express the matter thus, he shows
himself most plainly to be at issue with the apostle.
