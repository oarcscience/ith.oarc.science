<span id="xvii.iv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—The Argument of the
Apollinarians to Prove that Christ Was Without the Human Soul of This
Same Sort.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxxi-p2"></span>Although, then, this question remains
unsolved <span id="page_329">p. 329</span> <span
id="xvii.iv.xxxi-Page_329"></span>by these passages of Scripture, which
are certainly indecisive so far as pertains to the point before us, yet
I am quite sure of this, that those persons who think that the soul of
the first woman did not come from her husband’s soul, on the ground of
its being only said, “Flesh of my flesh,” and not, “Soul of my soul,”
do, in fact, argue in precisely the same manner as the Apollinarians
argue, and all such gainsayers, in opposition to the Lord’s human soul,
which they deny for no other reason than because they read in the
Scripture, “The Word was made flesh.” <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md) For if, say they, there was a soul
in Him also, it ought to have been said, “The Word was made man.” But
the reason why the great truth is stated in the terms in question really
is, that under the designation *flesh,* Holy Scripture is accustomed to
describe the entire human being, as in the passage, “And all flesh shall
see the salvation of God.” <span id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md)
For flesh alone without the soul cannot see anything. Besides, many
other passages of the Holy Scriptures go to make it manifest, without
any ambiguity, that in the man Christ there is not only flesh, but a
human—that is, a reasonable—soul also. Whence they, who maintain the
propagation of souls might also understand that a part is put for the
whole in the passage, “Bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh,” in such
wise that the soul, too, be understood as implied in the words, in the
same manner as we believe that the Word became flesh, not without the
soul. All that is wanted is, that they should support their opinion of
the propagation of souls on passages which are unambiguous; just as
other passages of Scripture show us that Christ possesses a human soul.
On precisely the same principle we advise the other side also, who do
away with the opinion of the propagation of souls, that they should
produce certain proofs for their assertion that souls are created by God
in every fresh case by insufflation, and that they should then maintain
the position that the saying, “This is bone of my bone, and flesh of my
flesh,” was not spoken figuratively as a part for the whole, including
the soul in its signification, but in a bare literal sense of the flesh
alone.
