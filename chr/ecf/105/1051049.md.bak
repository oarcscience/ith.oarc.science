<span id="xxi.ii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[VIII.\]—The Effect of Divine
Grace.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xiii-p2"></span>Accordingly, our only Master and Lord
Himself, when He had said what I have above mentioned,—“This is the work
of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent,”—says a little
afterwards in that same discourse of His, “I said unto you that ye also
have seen me and have not believed. All that the Father giveth me shall
come to me.” <span id="fr_3465"></span>[3466](#fn_3465.md) What is the
meaning of “shall come to me,” but, “shall believe in me”? But it is the
Father’s gift that this may be the case. Moreover, a little after He
says, “Murmur not among yourselves. No one can come to me, except the
Father which hath sent me draw him; and I will raise him up at the last
day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all
teachable <span id="fr_3466"></span>[3467](#fn_3466.md) of God. Every man
that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me.” <span
id="fr_3467"></span>[3468](#fn_3467.md) What is the meaning of, “Every man
that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me,”
except that there is none who hears from the Father, and learns, who
cometh not to me? For if every one who has heard from the Father, and
has learned, comes, certainly every one who does not come has not heard
from the Father; for if he had heard and learned, he would come. For no
one has heard and learned, and has not come; but every one, as the Truth
declares, who has heard from the Father, and has learned, comes. Far
removed from the senses of the flesh is this teaching in which the
Father is heard, and teaches to come to the Son. Engaged herein is also
the Son Himself, because He is His Word by which He thus teaches; and He
does not do this through the ear of the flesh, but of the heart. Herein
engaged, also, at the same time, is the Spirit of the Father and of the
Son; and He, too, teaches, and does not teach separately, since we have
learned that the workings of the Trinity are inseparable. And <span
id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span id="xxi.ii.xiii-Page_505"></span>that
is certainly the same Holy Spirit of whom the apostle says, “We,
however, having the same Spirit of faith.” <span
id="fr_3468"></span>[3469](#fn_3468.md) But this is especially attributed
to the Father, for the reason that of Him is begotten the Only Begotten,
and from Him proceeds the Holy Spirit, of which it would be tedious to
argue more elaborately; and I think that my work in fifteen books on the
Trinity which God is, has already reached you. Very far removed, I say,
from the senses of the flesh is this instruction wherein God is heard
and teaches. We see that many come to the Son because we see that many
believe on Christ, but when and how they have heard this from the
Father, and have learned, we see not. It is true that that grace is
exceedingly secret, but who doubts that it is grace? This grace,
therefore, which is hiddenly bestowed in human hearts by the Divine
gift, is rejected by no hard heart, because it is given for the sake of
first taking away the hardness of the heart. When, therefore, the Father
is heard within, and teaches, so that a man comes to the Son, He takes
away the heart of stone and gives a heart of flesh, as in the
declaration of the prophet He has promised. Because He thus makes them
children and vessels of mercy which He has prepared for glory.
