<span id="xv.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[XVI.\]—Does Pelagius
Designedly Refrain from Openly Saying that All Good Action is from
God?</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xvii-p2"></span>“That we are able to speak,” says he,
“is of God; but that we make a good or a bad use of speech is of
ourselves.” He, however, who has made the most excellent use of speech
does not teach us so. “For,” says He, “it is not ye that speak, but the
Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.” <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823.md) “So, again,” adds Pelagius, “that I
may, by applying a general case in illustration, embrace all,—that we
are able to do, say, think, any good thing, comes from Him who has
endowed us with this ability, and who also assists it.” Observe how even
here he repeats his former meaning —that of these three, capacity,
volition, action, it is only the capacity which receives help. Then, by
way of completely stating what he intends to say, he adds: “But that we
really do a good thing, or speak a good word, or think a good thought,
proceeds from our own selves.” He forgot what he had before <span
id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824.md) said by way of correcting, as it
were, his own words; for after saying, “Man is to be praised therefore
for his willing and doing a good work,” he at once goes on to modify his
statement thus: “Or rather, this praise belongs both to man, and to God
who has given him the capacity of this very will and work.” Now what is
the reason why he did not remember this admission when giving his
examples, so as to say this much at least after quoting them: “That we
are able to do, say, think any good thing, comes from Him who has given
us this ability, and who also assists it. That, however, we really do a
good thing, or speak a good word, or think a good thought, proceeds
*both from ourselves and from Him!*” This, however, he has not said.
But, if I am not mistaken, I think I see why he was afraid to do so.
