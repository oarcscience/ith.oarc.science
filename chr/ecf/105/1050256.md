id="xii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[VIII.\]—Even They Who Were Not
Able to Be Justified are Condemned.</span>

<span id="xii.xiii-p2"></span>See what he has said. I, however, affirm
that an infant born in a place where it was not possible for him to be
admitted to the baptism of Christ, and being overtaken by death, was
placed in such circumstances, that is to say, died without the bath of
regeneration, because it was not possible for him to be otherwise. He
would therefore absolve him, and, in spite of the Lord’s sentence, open
to him the kingdom of heaven. The apostle, however, does not absolve
him, when he says: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; by which death passed upon all men, for that all have
sinned.” <span id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148) Rightly, therefore,
by virtue of that condemnation which runs throughout the mass, is he not
admitted into the kingdom of heaven, although he was not only not a
Christian, but was unable to become one.
