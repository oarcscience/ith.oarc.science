id="x.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Infants are Described as
Believers and as Penitents. Sins Alone Separate Between God and
Men.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxv-p2"></span>Some one will say: How then are mere
infants called to repentance? How can such as they repent of anything?
The answer to this is: If they must not be called penitents because they
have not the sense of repenting, neither must they be called believers,
because they likewise have not the sense of believing. But if they are
rightly called believers, <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md)
because they in a certain sense profess faith by the words of their
parents, why are they not also held to be before that penitents when
they are shown to renounce the devil and this world by the profession
again of the same parents? The whole of this is done in hope, in the
strength of the sacrament and of the divine grace which the Lord has
bestowed upon the Church. But yet who knows not that the baptized infant
fails to be benefited from what he received as a little child, if on
coming to years of reason he fails to believe and to abstain from
unlawful desires? If, however, the infant departs from the present life
after he has received baptism, the guilt in which he was involved by
original sin being done away, he shall be made perfect in that light of
truth, which, remaining unchangeable for evermore, illumines the
justified in the presence of their Creator. For sins alone separate
between men and God; and these are done away by Christ’s grace, through
whom, as Mediator, we are reconciled, when He justifies the ungodly.
