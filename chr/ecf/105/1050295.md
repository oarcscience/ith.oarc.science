<span id="xii.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48 \[XLI.\]—How the Term “All” Is to Be
Understood.</span>

<span id="xii.lii-p2"></span>His opponents adduced the passage, “All
have sinned,” <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) and he met
their statement founded on this with the remark that “the apostle was
manifestly speaking of the then existing generation, that is, the Jews
and the Gentiles;” but surely the passage which I have quoted, “By one
man sin entered the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon
all men; in which all have sinned,” <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md) embraces in its terms the
generations both of old and of modern times, both ourselves and our
posterity. He adduces also this passage, whence he would prove that we
ought not to understand all without exception, when “all” is used:—“As
by the offence of one,” he says, “upon all men to condemnation, even so
by the righteousness of One, upon all men unto justification of
life.” <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md) “There can be no
doubt,” he says, “that not all men are sanctified by the righteousness
of Christ, but only those who are <span id="page_138">p. 138</span>
<span id="xii.lii-Page_138"></span>willing to obey Him, and have been
cleansed in the washing of His baptism.” Well, but he does not prove
what he wants by this quotation. For as the clause, “By the offence of
one, upon all men to condemnation,” is so worded that not one is omitted
in its sense, so in the corresponding clause, “By the righteousness of
One, upon all men unto justification of life,” no one is omitted in its
sense,—not, indeed, because all men have faith and are washed in His
baptism, but because no man is justified unless he believes in Christ
and is cleansed by His baptism. The term “*all*” is therefore used in a
way which shows that no one whatever can be supposed able to be saved by
any other means than through Christ Himself. For if in a city there be
appointed but one instructor, we are most correct in saying: That man
teaches all in that place; not meaning, indeed, that all who live in the
city take lessons of him, but that no one is instructed unless taught by
him. In like manner no one is justified unless Christ has justified
him. <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md)
