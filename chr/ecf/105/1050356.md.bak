<span id="xiii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—(20.) Who May Be Said to Walk
Without Spot; Damnable and Venial Sins.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxiv-p2"></span>Having premised these remarks, let us
carefully attend to the passages which he whom we are answering has
produced, as if we ourselves had quoted them. “In Deuteronomy, ‘Thou
shalt be perfect before the Lord thy God.’ <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) Again, in the same book, ‘There
shall be not an imperfect man <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md)
among the sons of Israel.’ <span id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) In
like manner the Saviour says in the Gospel, Be ye perfect, even as your
Father which is in heaven is perfect.’ <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) So the apostle, in his second
Epistle to the Corinthians, says: ‘Finally, brethren, farewell. Be
perfect.’ <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) Again, to the
Colossians he writes: ‘Warning every man, and teaching every man in all
wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.’ <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) And so to the Philippians: ‘Do all
things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and
harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.’ <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) In like manner to the Ephesians he
writes: ‘Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in
Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of
the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.’ <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) Then again to the Colossians he
says in another passage: ‘And you, that were sometime alienated, and
enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the
body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable
and unreprovable in His sight.’ <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) In the same strain, he says to the
Ephesians: ‘That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, <span
id="page_166">p. 166</span> <span id="xiii.xxiv-Page_166"></span>not
having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy
and without blemish.’ <span id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) So in
his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says ‘Be ye sober, and
righteous, and sin not.’ <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) So
again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written: ‘Wherefore gird up the
loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is
offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves
according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath
called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because
it is written, <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) Be ye holy;
for I am holy.’ <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) Whence
blessed David likewise says: ‘O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy
tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that walketh
without blame, and worketh righteousness.’ <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) And in another passage: ‘I shall be
blameless with Him.’ <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) And yet
again: ‘Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the
Lord.’ <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) To the same effect it
is written in Solomon: ‘The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all they that
are blameless are acceptable unto Him.’” <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) Now some of these passages exhort
men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer
to the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He,
however, is not unreasonably said to walk blamelessly, not who has
already reached the end of his journey, but who is pressing on towards
the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at the same
time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial.
For the way in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach
perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer. That, however, is a clean
prayer in which we say in truth, “Forgive us, as we ourselves
forgive.” <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) So that, as there
is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold on our course
to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this
perfect state, when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is
absolutely nothing which requires cleansing by forgiveness.
