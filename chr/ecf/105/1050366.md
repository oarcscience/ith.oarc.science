<span id="xiii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>(30.) “Every Man is a Liar,” Owing to
Himself Alone; But “Every Man is True,” By Help Only of the Grace of
God.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxxiv-p2"></span>“Moreover,” says he, “in Job himself it
is said: ‘And he maintained the miracle of a true man.’ <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) Again we read in Solomon, touching
wisdom: ‘Men that are liars cannot remember her, but men of truth shall
be found in her.’ <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) Again in
the Apocalypse: ‘And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are
without fault.’” <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) To all these
statements we reply with a reminder to our opponents, of how a man may
be called true, through the grace and truth of God, who is in himself
without doubt a liar. Whence it is said: “Every man is a liar.” <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) As for the passage also which he
has quoted in reference to Wisdom, when it is said, “Men of truth shall
be found in her,” we must observe that it is undoubtedly not “*in her*,”
but *in themselves* that men shall be found liars. Just as in another
passage: “Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the
Lord,” <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) —when he said, “Ye
were darkness,” he did not add, “in the Lord;” but after saying, “Ye are
now light,” he expressly added the phrase, “in the Lord,” for they could
not possibly be “light” in themselves; in order that “he who glorieth
may glory in the Lord.” <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) The
“faultless” ones, indeed, in the Apocalypse, are so called because “no
guile was found in their mouth.” <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) They did not say they had no sin:
if they had said this, they would deceive themselves, and the truth
would not be in them; <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) and if
the truth were not in them, guile and untruth would be found in their
mouth. If, however, to avoid envy, they said they were not without sin,
although they were sinless, then this very insincerity would be a lie,
and the character given of them would be untrue: “In their mouth was
found no guile.” Hence indeed “they are without fault;” for as they have
<span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="xiii.xxxiv-Page_170"></span>forgiven those who have done them wrong,
so are they purified by God’s forgiveness of themselves. Observe now how
we have to the best of our power explained in what sense the quotations
he has in his own behalf advanced ought to be understood. But how the
passage, “Every man is a liar,” is to be interpreted, he on his part has
altogether omitted to explain; nor is an explanation within his power,
without a correction of the error which makes him believe that man can
be true without the help of God’s grace, and merely by virtue of his own
free will.
