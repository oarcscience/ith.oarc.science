<span id="xvi.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[VIII.\]—This Disease of
Concupiscence in Marriage is Not to Be a Matter of Will, But of
Necessity; What Ought to Be the Will of Believers in the Use of
Matrimony; Who is to Be Regarded as Using, and Not Succumbing To, the
Evil of Concupiscence; How the Holy Fathers of the Old Testament
Formerly Used Wives.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.ix-p2"></span>This disease of concupiscence is what the
apostle refers to, when, speaking to married believers, he says: “This
is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain
from fornication: that every one of you should know how to possess his
vessel in sanctification and honour; not in the disease of desire, even
as the Gentiles which know not God.” <span
id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083.md) The married believer, therefore,
must not only not use another man’s vessel, which is what they do who
lust after others’ wives; but he must know that even his own vessel is
not to be possessed in the disease of carnal concupiscence. And this
counsel is not to be understood as if the apostle prohibited
conjugal—that is to say, lawful and honourable—cohabitation; but so as
that that cohabitation (which would have no adjunct of unwholesome lust,
were it not that man’s perfect freedom of choice had become by preceding
sin so disabled that it has this fatal adjunct) should not be a matter
of will, but of necessity, without which, nevertheless, it would be
impossible to attain to the fruition of the will itself in the
procreation of children. And this wish is not in the marriages of
believers determined by the purpose of having such children born as
shall pass through life in this present world, but such as shall be born
again in Christ, and remain in Him for evermore. Now if this result
should come about, the reward of a full felicity will spring from
marriage; but if such result be not realized, there will yet ensue to
the married pair the peace of their good will. Whosoever possesses his
vessel (that is, his wife) with this intention of heart, certainly does
not possess her in the “disease of desire,” as the Gentiles which know
not God, but in sanctification and honour, as believers who hope in God.
A man turns to use the evil of concupiscence, and is not overcome by it,
when he bridles and restrains its rage, as it works in inordinate and
indecorous motions; and never relaxes his hold upon it except when
intent on offspring, and then controls and applies it to the carnal
generation of children to be spiritually regenerated, not to the
subjection of the spirit to the flesh in a sordid servitude. That the
holy fathers of olden times after Abraham, and before him, to whom God
gave His testimony that “they pleased Him,”  <span
id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084.md) thus used their wives, no one who
is a Christian ought to doubt, since it was permitted to certain
individuals amongst them to have a plurality of wives, where the reason
was for the multiplication of their offspring, not the desire of varying
gratification.
