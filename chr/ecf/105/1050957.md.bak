<span id="xix.iv.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XI.\]—The Pelagians Maintain
that the Law is the Grace of God Which Helps Us Not to Sin.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxiii-p2"></span>Why, therefore, do those very vain and
perverse Pelagians say that the law is the grace of God by which we are
helped not to sin? Do they not, by making such an allegation, unhappily
and beyond all doubt contradict the great apostle? He, indeed, says,
that by the law sin received strength against man; and that man, by the
commandment, although it be holy, and just, and good, nevertheless dies,
and that death works in him through that which is good, from which death
there is no deliverance unless the Spirit quickens him, whom the letter
had killed,—as he says in another passage, “The letter killeth, but the
Spirit giveth life.” <span id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081.md) And yet
these obstinate persons, blind to God’s light, and deaf to His voice,
maintain that the letter which kills gives life, and thus gainsay the
quickening Spirit. “Therefore, brethren” (that I may warn you with
better effect in the words of the apostle himself), “we are debtors not
to the flesh, to live after the flesh; for if ye live after the flesh ye
shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the
body, ye shall live.” <span id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) I have
said this to deter your free will from evil, and to exhort it to good by
apostolic words; but yet you must not therefore glory in man,—that is to
say, in your own selves,—and not in the Lord, when you live not after
the flesh, but through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh. For in
order that they to whom the apostle addressed this language might not
exalt themselves, thinking that they were themselves able of their own
spirit to do such good works as these, and not by the Spirit of God,
after saying to them, “If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of
the flesh, ye shall live,” he at once added, “For as many as are led by
the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.” <span
id="fr_3083"></span>[3084](#fn_3083.md) When, therefore, you by the Spirit
mortify the deeds of the flesh, that you may have life, glorify Him,
praise Him, give thanks to Him by whose Spirit you are so led as to be
able to do such things as show you to be the children of God; “for as
many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”
