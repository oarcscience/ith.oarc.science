<span id="x.iii.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 53.—The Utility of the Books of the
Old Testament.</span>

<span id="x.iii.liii-p2"></span>Under so great a weight of testimony,
who would not be oppressed that should dare lift up his voice against
the truth of God? And many other testimonies might be found, were it not
for my anxiety to bring this tract to an end,—an anxiety which I must
not slight. I have deemed it superfluous to quote from the books of the
Old Testament, likewise, many attestations to our doctrine in inspired
words, since what is concealed in them under the veil of earthly
promises is clearly revealed in the preaching of the New Testament. Our
Lord Himself briefly demonstrated and defined the use of the Old
Testament writings, when He said that it was necessary that what had
been written concerning Himself in the Law, and the Prophets, and the
Psalms, should be fulfilled, and that this was that Christ must suffer,
and rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem.  <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) In agreement with
this is that statement of Peter which I have already quoted, how that
all the prophets bear witness to Christ, that at His hands every one
that believes in Him receives remission of his sins. <span
