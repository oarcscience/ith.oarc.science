<span id="xvi.v.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—How Concupiscence Made a
Captive of the Apostle; What the Law of Sin Was to the Apostle.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxiv-p2"></span>Then, indeed, this statement, “I see
another law in my members warring against the law of my mind,” refers to
that very concupiscence which we are now speaking of—the law of sin in
our sinful flesh. But when he said, “And bringing me into captivity to
the law of sin,” that is, to its own self, “which is in my members,” he
either meant “bringing me into captivity,” in the sense of *endeavouring
to make* me captive, that is, urging me to approve and accomplish evil
desire; or rather (and this opens no controversy), in the sense of
leading me captive according to the flesh, and, if this is not possessed
by the carnal concupiscence which he calls the law of sin, no unlawful
desire—such as our mind ought not to obey—would,of course, be there to
excite and disturb. The fact, however, that the apostle does not say,
Bringing *my flesh* into captivity, but “Bringing *me* into captivity,”
leads us to look out for some other meaning for the phrase, and to
understand the term “bringing me into captivity” as if he had said,
endeavouring to make me captive. But why, after all, might he not say,
“Bringing me into captivity,” and at the same time mean us to understand
his flesh? Was it not spoken by one concerning Jesus, when His flesh was
not found in the sepulchre: “They have taken away my Lord, and I know
not where they have laid Him”? <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md) Was Mary’s then an improper
question, because she said, “My Lord,” and not “My Lord’s body” or
“flesh”?
