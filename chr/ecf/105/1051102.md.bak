<span id="xxi.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Ambrose on God’s Control Over
Men’s Thoughts.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxii-p2"></span>And when Ambrose said this, he was
speaking in that treatise which he wrote concerning Flight from the
World, wherein he taught that this world was to be fled not by the body,
but by the heart, which he argued could not be done except by God’s
help. For he says: “We hear frequent discourse concerning fleeing from
this world, and I would that the mind was as careful and solicitous as
the discourse is easy; but what is worse, the enticement of earthly
lusts constantly creeps in, and the pouring out of vanities takes
possession of the mind; so that what you desire to avoid, this you think
of and consider in your mind. And this is difficult for a man to beware
of, but impossible to get rid of. Finally, the prophet bears witness
that it is a matter of wish rather than of accomplishment, when he says,
‘Incline my heart to Thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.’ <span
id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598.md) For our heart and our thoughts are
not in our own power, and these, poured forth unexpectedly, confuse our
mind and soul, and draw them in a different direction from that which
you have proposed to yourself; they recall you to worldly things, they
interpose things of time, they suggest voluptuous things, they inweave
enticing things, and in the very moment when we are seeking to elevate
our mind, we are for the most part filled with vain thoughts and cast
down to earthly things.” <span id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599.md)
Therefore it is not in the power of men, but in that of God, that men
have power to become sons of God. <span
id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600.md) Because they receive it from Him
who gives pious thoughts to the human heart, by which it has faith,
which worketh by love; <span id="fr_3601"></span>[3602](#fn_3601.md) for
the receiving and keeping of which benefit, and for carrying it on
perseveringly unto the end, we are not sufficient to think anything as
of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God, <span
id="fr_3602"></span>[3603](#fn_3602.md) in whose power is our heart and our
thoughts.
