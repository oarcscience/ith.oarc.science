<span id="xvi.vi.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32 \[XVII.\]—God Not the Author
of the Evil in Those Whom He Creates.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>Then, does God feed the children of
perdition, the goats on His left hand, <span
id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263) for the devil and nourish and
clothe them for the devil “because He maketh His sun to rise on the evil
and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust”? <span
id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264) He creates, then, the evil just in
the same way as He feeds and nourishes the evil; because what He bestows
on them by creating them appertains to the goodness of nature; and the
growth which He gives them by food and nourishment, He bestows on them,
of course, as a kindly help, not to their evil character, but to that
same good nature which He in His goodness created. For in as far as they
are human beings—this is a good of that nature whose author and maker is
God; but in as far as they are born with sin and so destined to
perdition unless they are born again, they belong to the seed which was
cursed from the beginning, <span id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265) by
the fault of the primitive disobedience. This fault, however, is turned
to good account by the Maker of even the vessels of wrath, that He may
make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy: <span
id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266) and that no one may attribute to
any merits of his own, pertaining as he does to the self-same mass, his
deliverance through grace; but “he that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267)
