treatise.</span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="xvi.iii-p3"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xvi.iii-p3.1"></span>On</span> revising these two Books, which he
addressed to the Count Valerius, Augustin placed them immediately after
his reply to the discourse of the Arians, which was affixed to the
*Proceedings with Emeritus*. <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md)
Now these proceedings are stated to have taken place on the 20th of
September, in the year of our Lord 418. <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md) There can be no doubt, then, that
these subjoined books—or, at any rate, the former of them—were written
either at the close of the year 418, or in the beginning of the year
419. For, concerning this first book, Augustin says himself: “This book
of mine, however, which he \[Julianus\] says he answered in four books,
I wrote after the condemnation of Pelagius and Cœlestius. This,” he
adds, “I have deemed it right to mention, because he declares that my
words had been used by the enemies of the truth to bring it into odium.
Let no one, therefore, suppose that it was owing to this book of mine
that condemnation had been passed on the new heretics who are enemies of
the grace of Christ.” <span id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md) From
these words one may see at once that this first book was published about
the same time as the condemnation of the Pelagians in the year 418.

<span id="xvi.iii-p7"></span>Soon after its publication it began to be
assailed by the Pelagians, who observed that its perusal was producing
in the minds of the catholics much odium against their heresy. One of
them, Julianus, <span id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) influenced
with a warm desire of furthering the heretical movement, attacked the
first book of Augustin’s treatise in four books of his own. Out of
these, sundry extracts were culled by some interested person, and
forwarded to Count Valerius. Valerius despatched them from Ravenna to
Rome, to Alypius, <span id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) in order
that he, on returning to Africa, might hand them to Augustin for the
purpose of an early refutation, together with a letter in which Valerius
thanked Augustin for the previous work which he also mentioned. Augustin
saw at once that these extracts had been taken out of the work of
Julianus; and, although he preferred reserving his answer to the
selections till he had received the entire work from which they were
culled, he still thought that he was bound to avoid all delay in
satisfying the Count Valerius. Without loss of time, therefore, he drew
up in answer his second book, with the same title as before, *On
Marriage and Concupiscence*, which, as we think, must be assigned to the
year 420, since the holy doctor wrote it immediately after the
expression of thanks for the first book; for it is clearly improbable
that Valerius should have waited two years or more to make the
acknowledgment of his gratitude.

<span id="xvi.iii-p10"></span>Moreover, the Valerius whom Augustin
dignifies with the title of *Illustrious* as well as *Count*, was much
employed in public life—not, to be sure, in the forum, but in the field;
and from this circumstance we find it difficult to accede to the opinion
that supposes him to have been the same person with the Valerius who was
Count of the Private Estate in the year 425, Consul in 432, and lastly
Master of the Offices under Theodosius the younger in the year 434.
These appointments, indeed, had no connection with military service, nor
had the prefects of Theodosius anything in common with those of
Honorius.
