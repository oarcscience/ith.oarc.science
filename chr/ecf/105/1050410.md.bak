<span id="xiv.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—The Pelagians Falsely Pretended
that the Eastern Churches Were on Their Side.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxix-p2"></span>Now, by reason of these questions, and the
very contentious assertions of these tenets, which are everywhere
accompanied with heated feelings, many weak brethren were disturbed. We
have accordingly, in the anxiety of that love which it becomes us to
feel towards the Church of Christ through His grace, and out of regard
to Marcellinus of blessed memory (who was extremely vexed day by day by
these disputers, and who asked my advice by letter), been obliged to
write on some of these questions, and especially on the baptism of
infants. On this same subject also I afterwards, at your request, and
assisted by your prayers, delivered an earnest address, to the best of
my ability, in the church of the *Majores*, <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) holding in my hands an epistle of
the most glorious martyr Cyprian, and reading therefrom and applying his
words on the very matter, in order to remove this dangerous error out of
the hearts of sundry persons, who had been persuaded to take up with the
opinions which, as we see, were condemned in these proceedings. These
opinions it has been attempted by their promoters to force upon the
minds of some of the brethren, by threatening, as if from the Eastern
Churches, that unless they adopted the said opinions, they would be
formally condemned by those Churches. Observe, however, that no less
than fourteen bishops of the Eastern Church, <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) assembled in synod in the land
where the Lord manifested His presence in the days of His flesh, refused
to acquit Pelagius unless he condemned these opinions as opposed to the
Catholic faith. Since, therefore, he was then acquitted because he
anathematized such views, it follows beyond a doubt that the said
opinions were condemned. This, indeed, will appear more clearly still,
and on still stronger evidence, in the sequel.
