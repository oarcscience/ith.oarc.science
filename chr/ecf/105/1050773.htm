<p><a name="xvii.vii.xvii-p2"></A>And now, as far as the Lord vouchsafes to enable me, I must reply also to that allegation of yours, in which, speaking of the soul, you again mention my name, and say, &#8220;We do not, as the very able and learned bishop Augustin professes, allow it to be incorporeal and also a spirit.&#8221; We have therefore, first, to discuss the question, whether the soul is to be deemed incorporeal, as I have said; or corporeal, as you hold. Then, secondly, whether in our Scriptures it is called a spirit&#8212;although not the whole but its own separate part is also properly called spirit.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2477"></A><A HREF="#fn_2477"><FONT SIZE="1">2478</FONT></A>
 Well, I should, to begin with, like to know how you define <i>body.</i> For if that is not &#8220;body&#8221; which does not consist of limbs of flesh, then the earth cannot be a body, nor the sky, nor a stone, nor water, nor the stars, nor anything of the kind. If, however, a &#8220;body&#8221; is whatever consists of parts, whether greater or less, which occupy greater or smaller local spaces, then all the things which I have just mentioned are bodies; the air is a body; the visible light is a body; and so are all the things which the apostle has in view, when he says, &#8220;There are celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2478"></A><A HREF="#fn_2478"><FONT SIZE="1">2479</FONT></A>
