<span id="xi.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45.—It is Not by Their Works, But by
Grace, that the Doers of the Law are Justified; God’s Saints and God’s
Name Hallowed in Different Senses.</span>

<span id="xi.xlviii-p2"></span>Now he could not mean to contradict
himself in saying, “The doers of the law shall be justified,” <span
id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md) as if their justification came through
their works, and not through grace; since he declares that a man is
justified freely by His grace without the works of the law, <span
id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) intending by the term “*freely*”
nothing else than that works do not precede justification. For in
another passage he expressly says, “If by grace, then is it no more of
works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.” <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md) But the statement that “the doers of
the law shall be justified” <span id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md) must
be so understood, as that we may know that they are not otherwise doers
of the law, unless they be justified, so that justification does not
subsequently accrue to them as doers of the law, but justification
precedes them as doers of the law. For what else does the phrase “being
justified” signify than being made righteous,—by Him, of course, who
justifies the ungodly man, that he may become a godly one instead? For
if we were to express a certain fact by saying, “The men will be
liberated,” the phrase would of course be understood as asserting that
the liberation would accrue to those who were men already; but if we
were to say, The men will be created, we should certainly not be
understood as asserting that the creation would happen to those who were
already in existence, but that they became men by the creation itself.
If in like manner it were said, The doers of the law shall be honoured,
we should only interpret the statement correctly if we supposed that the
honour was to accrue to those who were already doers of the law: but
when the allegation is, “The doers of the law shall be justified,” what
else does it mean than that the just shall be justified? for of course
the doers of the law are just persons. And thus it amounts to the same
thing as if it were said, The doers of the law shall be created,—not
those who were so already, but that they may become such; in order that
the Jews who were hearers of the law might hereby understand that they
wanted the grace of the Justifier, in order to be able to become its
doers also. Or else the term “They shall be justified” is used in the
sense of, They shall be deemed, or reckoned as just, as it is predicated
of a certain man in the Gospel, “But he, willing to justify
himself,” <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md) —meaning that he
wished to be thought and accounted just. In like manner, we attach one
meaning to the statement, “God sanctifies His saints,” and another to
the words, “Sanctified be Thy name;” <span
id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933.md) for in the former case we suppose the
words to mean that He makes those to be saints who were not saints
before, and in the latter, that the prayer would have that which is
always holy in itself be also regarded as holy by men,—in a word, be
feared with a hallowed awe.
