id="xiv.lxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 66.—The Harsh Measures of the Pelagians
Against the Holy Monks and Nuns Who Belonged to Jerome’s Charge.</span>

<span id="xiv.lxx-p2"></span>Certain followers of Pelagius are said to
have carried their support of his cause after these judicial proceedings
to an incredible extent of perverseness and audacity. They are
said <span id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) to have most cruelly
beaten and maltreated the servants and handmaidens of the Lord who lived
under the care of the holy presbyter Jerome, slain his deacon, and burnt
his monastic houses; whilst he himself, by God’s mercy, narrowly escaped
the violent attacks of these impious assailants in the shelter of a
well-defended fortress. However, I think it better becomes me to say
nothing of these matters, but to wait and see what measures our brethren
the bishops may deem it their duty to adopt concerning such scandalous
enormities; for nobody can suppose that it is possible for them to pass
them over without notice. Impious *doctrines* put forth by persons of
this character it is no doubt the duty of all catholics, however remote
their residence, to oppose and refute, and so to hinder all injury from
such opinions wheresoever they may happen to find their way; but impious
*actions* it belongs to the discipline of the episcopal authority on the
spot to control, and they must be left for punishment to the bishops of
the very place or immediate neighbourhood, to be dealt with as pastoral
diligence and godly severity may suggest. We, therefore, who live at so
great a distance, are bound to hope that such a stop may there be put to
proceedings of this kind, that there may be no necessity elsewhere of
further invoking judicial remedies. But what rather befits our personal
activity is so to set forth the truth, that the minds of all those who
have been severely wounded by the report, so widely spread everywhere,
may be healed by the mercy of God following our efforts. With this
desire, I must now at last terminate this work, which, should it
succeed, as I hope, in commending itself to your mind, will, I trust,
with the Lord’s blessing, become serviceable to its readers—recommended
to them rather by your name than by my own, and through your care and
diligence receiving a wider circulation.

<span id="xiv.lxx-p3"></span> He here refers to a letter (32) of Pope
Innocent to John, Bishop of Jerusalem. It thus commences: “Plunder,
slaughter, incendiary fire, every atrocity of the maddest kind have been
deplored by the noble and holy virgins Eustochium and Paula, as having
been perpetrated, at the devil’s instigation, in several places of your
diocese,” etc. An epistle by the same writer (33) addressed to Jerome,
begins with these words: “The apostle testifies that contention never
did any good to the Church.”
