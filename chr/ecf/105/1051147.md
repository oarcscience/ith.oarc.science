id="xxi.iii.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 65.—The Church’s Prayers Imply
the Church’s Faith.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lxvii-p2"></span>These things, therefore, which the
Church asks from the Lord, and always has asked from the time she began
to exist, God so foreknew that He would give to His called, that He has
already given them in predestination itself; as the apostle declares
without any ambiguity. For, writing to Timothy, he says, “Labour along
with the gospel according to the power of God, who saves us, and calls
us with His holy calling, not according to our works, but according to
His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
times of eternity, but is now made manifest by the coming of our Saviour
Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_3711"></span>[3712](#fn_3711.md) Let him,
therefore, say that the Church at any time has not had in its belief the
truth of this predestination and grace, which is now maintained with a
more careful heed against the late heretics; let him say this who dares
to say that at any time it has not prayed, or not truthfully prayed, as
well that unbelievers might believe, as that believers might persevere.
And if the Church has always prayed for these benefits, it has always
believed them to be certainly God’s gifts; nor was it ever right for it
to deny that they were foreknown by Him. And thus Christ’s Church has
never failed to hold the faith of this predestination, which is now
being defended with new solicitude against these modern heretics.
