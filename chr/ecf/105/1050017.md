<span id="x.ii-p5"></span>————————————

<span id="x.ii-p6"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="x.ii-p6.1"></span>A Necessity</span> arose which compelled me to
write against the new heresy of Pelagius. Our previous opposition to it
was confined to sermons and conversations, as occasions suggested, and
according to our respective abilities and duties; but it had not yet
assumed the shape of a controversy in writing. Certain questions were
then submitted to me \[by our brethren\] at Carthage, to which I was to
send them back answers in writing; I accordingly wrote first of all
three books, under the title “On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins,” in
which I mainly discussed the baptism of infants because of original sin,
and the grace of God by which we are justified, that is, made righteous;
but \[I remarked\] no man in this life can so keep the commandments
which prescribe holiness of life, as to be beyond the necessity of using
this prayer for his sins: “Forgive us our trespasses.” <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) It is in direct opposition to these
principles that they have devised their new heresy. Now throughout these
three books I thought it right not to mention any of their names, hoping
and desiring that by such reserve they might the more readily be set
right; nay more, in the third book (which is really a letter, but
reckoned amongst the books, because I wished to connect it with the two
previous ones) I actually quoted Pelagius’ name with considerable
commendation, because his conduct and life were made a good deal of by
many persons; and those statements of his which I refuted, he had
himself adduced in his writings, not indeed in his own name, but had
quoted them as the words of other persons. However, when he was
afterwards confirmed in heresy, he defended them with most persistent
animosity. Cœlestius, indeed, a disciple of his, had already been
excommunicated for similar opinions at Carthage, in a council of
bishops, at which I was not present. In a certain passage of my second
book I used these words: “Upon some there will be bestowed this blessing
at the last day, that they shall not perceive the actual suffering of
death in the suddenness of the change which shall happen to them;” <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) —reserving the passage for a more
careful consideration of the subject; for they will either die, or else
by a most rapid transition from this life to death, and then from death
to eternal life, as in the twinkling of an eye, they will not undergo
the feeling of mortality. This work of mine begins with this sentence:
“*However absorbing and intense the anxieties and annoyances.*”
