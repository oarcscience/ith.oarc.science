Intercourse.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxxi-p2"></span>“We say,” says he, “that the sexual
impulse—that is, that the virility itself, without which there can be no
intercourse—is ordained by God.” To this I reply that the sexual
impulse, and, to make use of his word, virility, without which there can
be no intercourse, was so appointed by God that there was in it nothing
to be ashamed of. For it was not fit that His creature should blush at
the work of his Creator; but by a just punishment the disobedience of
the members was the retribution to the disobedience of the first man,
for which disobedience they blushed when they covered with fig-leaves
those shameful parts which previously were not shameful.
