<p><a name="xv.iv.vii-p2"></A>The bishop, however, who presides over this See, upon seeing him hurrying headlong in so great presumption like a madman, chose in his great compassion, with a view to the man&#146;s repentance, if it might be, rather to bind him tightly by eliciting from him answers to questions proposed by himself, than by the stroke of a severe condemnation to drive him over the precipice, down which he seemed to be even now ready to fall. I say advisedly, &#8220;down which he seemed to be ready to fall,&#8221; rather than &#8220;over which he had actually fallen,&#8221; because he had already in this same book of his forecast the subject with an intended reference to questions of this sort in the following words: &#8220;If it should so happen that any error of ignorance has stolen over us human beings, let it be corrected by your decisive sentence.&#8221;</p>
