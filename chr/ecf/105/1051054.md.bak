id="xxi.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—The Preceding Argument Applied
to the Present Time.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xviii-p2"></span>Do you not see that my desire was,
without any prejudgment of the hidden counsel of God, and of other
reasons, to say what might seem sufficient about Christ’s foreknowledge,
to convince the unbelief of the pagans who had brought forward this
question? For what is more true than that Christ foreknew who should
believe on Him, and at what times and places they should believe? But
whether by the preaching of Christ to themselves by themselves they were
to have faith, or whether they would receive it by God’s gift,—that is,
whether God only foreknew them, or also predestinated them, I did not at
that time think it necessary to inquire or to discuss. Therefore what I
said, “that Christ willed to appear to men at that time, and that His
doctrine should be preached among them when He knew, and where He knew,
that there were those who would believe on Him,” may also thus be said,
“That Christ willed to appear to men at that time, and that His gospel
should be preached among those, whom He knew, and where He knew, that
there were those who had been elected in Himself before the foundation
of the world.” But since, if it were so said, it would make the reader
desirous of asking about those things which now by the warning of
Pelagian errors must of necessity be discussed with greater copiousness
and care, it seemed to me that what at that time was sufficient should
be briefly said, leaving to one side, as I said, the depth of the wisdom
and knowledge of God, and without prejudging other reasons, concerning
which I thought that we might more fittingly argue, not then, but at
some other time.
