<span id="xi.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XVII.\]—A Comparison of the Law
of Moses and of the New Law.</span>

<span id="xi.xxxii-p2"></span>Now, amidst this admirable correspondence,
there is at least this very considerable diversity in the cases, in that
the people in the earlier instance were deterred by a horrible dread
from approaching the place where the law was given; whereas in the other
case the Holy Ghost came upon them who were gathered together in
expectation of His promised gift. *There* it was on tables of stone that
the finger of God operated; *here* it was on the hearts of men. *There*
the law was given outwardly, so that the unrighteous might be
terrified; <span id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) *here* it was given
inwardly, so that they might be justified. <span
id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) For this, “Thou shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any
other commandment,”—such, of course, as was written on those tables,—“it
is briefly comprehended,” says he, “in this saying, namely, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour:
therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” <span
id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) Now this was not written on the tables
of stone, but “is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is
given unto us.” <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) God’s law,
therefore, is love. “To it the carnal mind is not subject, neither
indeed can be;” <span id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) but when the
works of love are written on tables to alarm the carnal mind, there
arises the law of works and “the letter which killeth” the transgressor;
but when love itself is shed abroad in the hearts of believers, then we
have the law of faith, and the spirit which gives life to him that
loves.
