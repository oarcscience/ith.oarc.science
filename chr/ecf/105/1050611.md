<span id="xvi.vi.v-p2"></span>But he has added other words of mine,
where I have said: “Nor do they reflect that the good of marriage is no
more impeachable by reason of the original evil which is derived
therefrom, than the evil of adultery and fornication can be excused by
reason of the natural good which is born of them. For as sin is the work
of the devil, whether derived from this source or from that; so is man,
whether born of this or that, the work of God.” Here, too, he has left
out some words, in which he was afraid of catholic ears. For to come to
the words here quoted, it had previously been said by us: “Because,
then, we affirm this doctrine, which is contained in the oldest and
unvarying rule of the catholic faith, these propounders of novel and
perverse dogmas, who deny that there is in infants any sin to be washed
away in the laver of regeneration, in their unbelief or ignorance
calumniate us as if we condemned marriage, and as if we asserted to be
the devil’s work what is God’s own work, to wit, the human being which
is born of marriage.” <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197.md) All
this passage he has passed over, and merely quoted the words which
follow it, as given above. Now, in the omitted words he was afraid of
the clause which suits all hearts in the catholic Church and appeals to
the very faith which has been firmly established and transmitted from
ancient times with unfaltering voice and excites their hostility most
strongly against us. The clause is this: “They deny that there is in
infants any sin to be washed away in the laver of regeneration.” For all
persons run to church with their infants for no other reason in the
world than that the original sin which is contracted in them by their
first and natural birth may be cleansed by the regeneration of their
second birth.
