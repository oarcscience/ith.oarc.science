<span id="xxi.ii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38 \[XIX.\]—What is the View of
the Pelagians, and What of the Semi-Pelagians, Concerning
Predestination.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxviii-p2"></span>But these brethren of ours, about
whom and on whose behalf we are now discoursing, say, perhaps, that the
Pelagians are refuted by this apostolical testimony in which it is said
that we are chosen in Christ and predestinated before the foundation of
the world, in order that we should be holy and immaculate in His sight
in love. For they think that “having received God’s commands we are of
ourselves by the choice of our free will made holy and immaculate in His
sight in love; and since God foresaw <span id="page_517">p. 517</span>
<span id="xxi.ii.xxxviii-Page_517"></span>that this would be the case,”
they say, “He therefore chose and predestinated us in Christ before the
foundation of the world.” Although the apostle says that it was not
because He foreknew that we should be such, but in order that we might
be such by the same election of His grace, by which He showed us favour
in His beloved Son. When, therefore, He predestinated us, He foreknew
His own work by which He makes us holy and immaculate. Whence the
Pelagian error is rightly refuted by this testimony. “But we say,” say
they, “that God did not foreknow anything as ours except that faith by
which we begin to believe, and that He chose and predestinated us before
the foundation of the world, in order that we might be holy and
immaculate by His grace and by His work.” But let them also hear in this
testimony the words where he says, “We have obtained a lot, being
predestinated according to His purpose who worketh all things.”  <span
id="fr_3532"></span>[3533](#fn_3532.md) He, therefore, worketh the
beginning of our belief who worketh all things; because faith itself
does not precede that calling of which it is said: “For the gifts and
calling of God are without repentance;” <span
id="fr_3533"></span>[3534](#fn_3533.md) and of which it is said: “Not of
works, but of Him that calleth” <span
id="fr_3534"></span>[3535](#fn_3534.md) (although He might have said, “of
Him that believeth”); and the election which the Lord signified when He
said: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.” <span
id="fr_3535"></span>[3536](#fn_3535.md) For He chose us, not because we
believed, but that we might believe, lest we should be said first to
have chosen Him, and so His word be false (which be it far from us to
think possible), “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.” Neither
are we called because we believed, but that we may believe; and by that
calling which is without repentance it is effected and carried through
that we should believe. But all the many things which we have said
concerning this matter need not to be repeated.
