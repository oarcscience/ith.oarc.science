<span id="xiii.xii-p2"></span>VIII. “Again, this question must be
asked,” he says, “how God wishes man to be,—with sin, or without sin?
Beyond doubt, He does not wish him to be with sin. We must reflect how
great would be the impious blasphemy for it to be said that man has it
in his power to be with sin, which God does not wish; and for it to be
denied that he has it in his power to be without sin, which God wishes:
just as if God had created any man for such a result as this,—that he
should be able to be what He would not have him, and unable to be what
He would have him; and that he should lead an existence contrary to His
will, rather than one which should be in accordance therewith.” This has
been in fact already answered; but I see that it is necessary for me to
make here an additional remark, that we are saved by hope. “But hope
that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope
for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait
for it.”  <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376) Full righteousness,
therefore, will only then be reached, when fulness of health is
attained; and this fulness of health shall be when there is fulness of
love, for “love is the fulfilling of the law;” <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377) and then shall come fulness of
love, when “we shall see Him even as He is.” <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378) Nor will any addition to love be
possible more, when faith shall have reached the fruition of sight.
