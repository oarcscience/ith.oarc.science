<span id="xv.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33 \[XVIII.\]—How Christ is Our
Mediator.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span>Of this flesh and blood Melchizedek
also, when he blessed Abram himself, <span
id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md) gave the testimony which is very
well known to Christian believers, so that long afterwards it was said
to Christ in the Psalms: “Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of
Melchizedek.” <span id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md) This was not
then an accomplished fact, but was still future; yet that faith of the
fathers, which is the self-same faith as our own, used to chant it. Now,
to all who find death in Adam, Christ is of this avail, that He is the
Mediator for life. He is, however, not a Mediator, because He is equal
with the Father; for in this respect He is Himself as far distant from
us as the Father; and how can there be any medium where the distance is
the very same? Therefore the apostle does not say, “There is one
Mediator between God and men, even Jesus Christ;” but his words are,
“The <span class="c16"><span id="xv.iv.xxxiii-p4.2"></span>Man</span>
Christ Jesus.” <span id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md) He is the
Mediator, then, in that He is man,—inferior to the Father, by so much as
He is nearer to ourselves, and superior to us, by so much as He is
nearer to the Father. This is more openly expressed thus: “He is
inferior to the Father, because in the form of a servant;” <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) superior to us, because without
spot of sin.
