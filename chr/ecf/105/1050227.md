<span id="xi.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51.—Faith the Ground of All
Righteousness.</span>

<span id="xi.liv-p2"></span>The righteousness of the law is proposed in
these terms,—that whosoever shall do it shall live in it; and the
purpose is, that when each has discovered his own weakness, he may not
by his own strength, nor by the letter of the law (which cannot be
done), but by faith, conciliating the Justifier, attain, and do, and
live in it. For the work in which he who does it shall live, is not done
except by one who is justified. His justification, however, is obtained
by faith; and concerning faith it is written, “Say not in thine heart,
Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring down Christ therefrom;)
or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again
from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy
mouth, and in thy heart: that is (says he), the word of faith which we
preach: That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead,
thou shalt be saved.” <span id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989.md) As far as
he is saved, so far is he righteous. For by this faith we believe that
God will raise even us from the dead,—even now in the spirit, that we
may in this present world live soberly, righteously, and godly in the
renewal of His grace; and by and by in our flesh, which shall rise again
to immortality, which indeed is the reward of the Spirit, who precedes
it by a resurrection which is appropriate to Himself,—that is, by
justification. “For we are buried with Christ by baptism unto death,
that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” <span
id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990.md) By faith, therefore, in Jesus Christ
we obtain salvation,—both in so far as it is begun within us in reality,
and in so far as its perfection is waited for in hope; “for whosoever
shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991.md) “How abundant,” says the Psalmist, “is
the multitude of Thy goodness, O Lord, which Thou hast laid up for them
that fear Thee, and hast perfected for them that hope in Thee!” <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992.md) By the law we fear God; by faith we
hope in God: but from those who fear punishment grace is hidden. And the
soul which labours under this fear, since it has not conquered its evil
concupiscence, and from which this fear, like a harsh master, has not
departed,—let it flee by faith for refuge to the mercy of God, that He
may give it what He commands, and may, by inspiring into it the
sweetness of His grace through His Holy Spirit, cause the soul to
delight more in what He teaches it, than it delights in what opposes His
instruction. In this manner it is that the great abundance of His
sweet<span id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span
id="xi.liv-Page_106"></span>ness,—that is, the law of faith,—His love
which is in our hearts, and shed abroad, is perfected in them that hope
in Him, that good may be wrought by the soul, healed not by the fear of
punishment, but by the love of righteousness.
