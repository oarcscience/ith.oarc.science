<span id="xvi.vi.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43.—The Good Tree in the Gospel
that Cannot Bring Forth Evil Fruit, Does Not Mean Marriage.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xliv-p2"></span>What, then, does he mean by saying, “A
tree is known by its fruits,” on the ground of our reading that the Lord
spake thus in the Gospel? Was, then, the Lord speaking of this question
in these words, and not rather of men’s two wills, the good and the
evil, calling one of these the good tree, and the other the corrupt
tree, inasmuch as good works spring out of a good will, and evil ones
out of an evil will—the converse being impossible, good works out of an
evil will, and evil ones out of a good will? If, however, we were to
suppose marriage to be the good tree, according to the Gospel simile
which he has mentioned, then, of course, we must on the other hand
assume fornication to be the corrupt tree. Wherefore, if a human being
is said to be the fruit of marriage, in the sense of the good fruit of a
good tree, then undoubtedly a human being could never have been born in
fornication. “For a corrupt tree bringeth not forth good fruit.”  <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285) Once more, if he were to say that
not adultery must be supposed to occupy the place of the tree, but
rather human nature, of which man is born, then in this way not even
marriage can stand for the tree, but only the human nature of which man
is born. His simile, therefore, taken from the Gospel avails him nothing
in elucidating this question, because marriage is not the cause of the
sin which is transmitted in the natural birth, and atoned for in the new
birth; but the voluntary transgression of the first man is the cause of
original sin. “You repeat,” says he, “your allegation, ‘Just as sin,
from whatever source it is derived to infants, is the work of the devil,
so man, howsoever he be born, is the work of God.’” Yes, I said this,
and most truly too; and if this man were not a Pelagian, but a catholic,
he too would have nothing else to avow in the catholic faith.
