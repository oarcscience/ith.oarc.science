<span id="xiv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[IV.\]—The Fourth Item in the
Accusation; And Pelagius’ Answer.</span>

<span id="xiv.xvi-p2"></span>It was further objected against Pelagius,
as if he had written in his book, that “evil does not enter our
thoughts.” In reply, however, to this charge, he said: “We made no such
statement. What we did say was, that the Christian ought to be careful
not to have evil thoughts.” Of this, as it became them, the bishops
approved. For who can doubt that evil ought not to be thought of? And,
indeed, if what he said in his book about “evil not being thought” runs
in this form, “neither is evil to be thought of,” the ordinary meaning
of such words is “that evil ought not even to be thought of.” Now if any
person denies this, what else does he in fact say, than that evil ought
to be thought of? And if this were true, it could not be said in praise
of love that “it thinketh no evil!” <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) But after all, the phrase about
“*not entering into the thoughts*” of righteous and holy men is not
quite a commendable one, for this reason, that what enters the mind is
commonly called a thought, even when assent to it does not follow. The
thought, however, which contracts blame, and is justly forbidden, is
never unaccompanied with assent. Possibly those men had an incorrect
copy of Pelagius’ writings, who thought it proper to object to him that
he had used the words: “Evil does not enter into our thoughts;” that is,
that whatever is evil never enters into the thoughts of righteous and
holy men. Which is, of course, a very absurd statement. For whenever we
censure evil things, we cannot enunciate them in words, unless they have
been thought. But, as we said before, that is termed a culpable thought
of evil which carries with it assent.
