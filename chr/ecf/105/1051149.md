<span id="xxi.iii.lxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 67.—The Most Eminent Instance of
Predestination is Christ Jesus.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lxix-p2"></span>But there is no more illustrious
instance of predestination than Jesus Himself, concerning which also I
have already argued in the former treatise; <span
id="fr_3713"></span>[3714](#fn_3713.md) and in the end of this I have
chosen to insist upon it. There is no more eminent instance, I say, of
predestination than the Mediator Himself. If any believer wishes
thoroughly to understand this doctrine, let him consider Him, and in Him
he will find himself also. The believer, I say; who in Him believes and
confesses the true human nature that is our own, however singularly
elevated by assumption by God the Word into the only Son of God, so that
He who assumed, and what He assumed, should be one person in Trinity.
For it was not a Quaternity that resulted from the assumption of man,
but it remained a Trinity, inasmuch as that assumption ineffably made
the truth of one person in God and man. Because we say that Christ was
not only God, as the Manichean heretics contend; nor only man, as the
Photinian heretics assert; nor in such wise man as to have less of
anything which of a certainty pertains to human nature,—whether a soul,
or in the soul itself a rational mind, or flesh not taken of the woman,
but made from the Word converted and changed into flesh,—all which three
false and empty notions have made the three various and diverse parties
of the Apollinarian heretics; but we say that Christ was true God, born
of God the Father without any beginning of time; and that He was also
true or very man, born of human mother in the certain fulness of time;
and that His humanity, whereby He is less than the Father, does not
diminish aught from His divinity, whereby He is equal to the Father. For
both of them are One Christ—who, moreover, most truly said in respect of
the God, “I and the Father are one;” <span
id="fr_3714"></span>[3715](#fn_3714.md) and most truly said in respect of
the man, “My Father is greater than I.” <span
id="fr_3715"></span>[3716](#fn_3715.md) He, therefore, who made of the seed
of David this righteous man, who never should be unrighteous, without
any merit of His preceding will, is the same who also makes righteous
men of unrighteous, without any merit of their will preceding; that He
might be the head, and they His members. He, therefore, who made that
man with no precedent merits of His, neither to deduce from His origin
nor to commit by His will any sin which should be remitted to Him, the
same makes believers on Him with no preceding merits of theirs, to whom
He forgives all sin. He who made Him such that He never had or should
have an evil will, the same makes in His members a good will out of an
evil one. Therefore He predestinated both Him and us, because both in
Him that He might be our head, and in us that we should be His body, He
foreknew that our merits would not precede, but that His doings should.
