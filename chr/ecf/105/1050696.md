id="xvii.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24 \[XV.\]—Whether or No the Soul
is Derived by Natural Descent (Ex Traduce), His Cited Passages Fail to
Show.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>Forasmuch, then, as the passages of
Scripture which he mentions by no means show what he endeavours to
enforce (since, indeed, they express nothing at all on the immediate
question before us), what can be the meaning of these words of his: “We
firmly maintain that the soul comes from the breath of God, not from
natural generation, because it is given from God”? As if, forsooth, the
body could be given from another, than from Him by whom it is created,
“Of whom are all things, through whom are all things, in whom are all
things;” <span id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md) not that they are of
His nature, but of His workmanship. “Nor is it from nothing,” says he,
“because it comes forth from God.” Whether this be so, is (we must say)
not the question to be here entertained. At the same time, we do not
hesitate to <span id="page_325">p. 325</span> <span
id="xvii.iv.xxiv-Page_325"></span>affirm, that the proposition which he
advances, that the soul comes to man neither out of descent nor out of
nothing, is certainly not true: this, I say, we affirm to be without
doubt not true. For it is one of two things: if the soul is not derived
by natural descent from the parent, it comes out of nothing. To pretend
that it is derived from God in such wise as to be a portion of His
nature, is simply sacrilegious blasphemy. But we solicit and seek up to
the present time some plain passages of Scripture bearing on the point,
whether the soul does not come by parental descent; but we do not want
such passages as he has adduced, which yield no illustration of the
question now before us.
