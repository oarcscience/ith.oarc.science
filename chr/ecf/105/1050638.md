<span id="xvi.vi.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31 \[XVI.\]—Why God Proceeds to
Create Human Beings, Who He Knows Will Be Born in Sin.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxxii-p2"></span>Let us now look at those three clauses
of his, than which three, he says, nothing more profane could possibly
be uttered: “Either God did not make man, or else He made him for the
devil; or, at any rate, the devil framed God’s image, that is, man.”
Now, the first and the last of these sentences, even he himself must
allow, if he be not reckless and perverse, were never uttered by us. The
dispute is confined to that which he puts second between the other two.
In respect of this, he is so far mistaken as to suppose that we had said
that God made man for the devil; as if, in the case of human beings whom
God creates of human parents, His care and purpose and provision were,
that by means of His workmanship the devil should have as slaves those
whom he is unable to make for himself. God forbid that any sort of pious
belief, however childish, should ever entertain such a sentiment as
this! Of His own goodness God has made man—the first without sin, all
others under sin—for the purposes of His own profound thoughts. For just
as He knew full well what to do with reference to the malice of the
devil himself, and what He does is just and good, however unjust and
evil he is, about whom He takes His measures; and just as He was not
unwilling to create him because He foresaw that he would be evil; so in
regard to the entire human race, though not a man of it is born without
the taint of sin, He who is supremely good Himself is always working out
good, making some men, as it were, “vessels of mercy,” whom grace
distinguishes from those who are “vessels of wrath;” whilst He makes
others, as it were, “vessels of wrath,” that He may make known the
riches of His glory towards the vessels of mercy. <span
id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261.md) Let, then, this objector go and
contest the point against the apostle, whose words I use; nay, against
the very Potter, whom the apostle forbids us answering again, in the
well-known words: “Who art thou, O man, that repliest against God! Shall
the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast <span
id="page_296">p. 296</span> <span id="xvi.vi.xxxii-Page_296"></span>thou
made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump
to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?”  <span
id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262.md) Well now, will this man contend
that the vessels of wrath are not under the dominion of the devil? or
else, because they are under this dominion, are they made by another
creator than He who makes the vessels of mercy? Or does He make them of
other material, and not out of the self-same lump? Here, then, he may
object, and say: “Therefore God makes these vessels for the devil.” As
if God knew not how to make such a use of even these for the furtherance
of His own good and righteous works, as He makes of the very devil
himself.
