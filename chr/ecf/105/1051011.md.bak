<span id="xx.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—The Answer.</span>

<span id="xx.xxx-p2"></span>Wherefore we most wholesomely confess what
we most correctly believe, that the God and Lord of all things, who in
His strength created all things good, and foreknew that evil things
would arise out of good, and knew that it pertained to His most
omnipotent goodness even to do good out of evil things rather than not
to allow evil things to be at all, so ordained the life of angels and
men that in it He might first of all show what their free will was
capable of, and then what the kindness of His grace and the judgment of
His righteousness was capable of. Finally, certain angels, of whom the
chief is he who is called the devil, became by free will outcasts from
the Lord God. Yet although they fled from His goodness, wherein they had
been blessed, they could not flee from His judgment, by which they were
made most wretched. Others, however, by the same free will stood fast in
the truth, and merited the knowledge of that most certain truth that
they should never fall. <span id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340.md) For
if from the Holy Scriptures we have been able to attain the knowledge
that none of <span id="page_483">p. 483</span> <span
id="xx.xxx-Page_483"></span>the holy angels shall fall evermore, how
much more have they themselves attained this knowledge by the truth more
sublimely revealed to them! Because to us is promised a blessed life
without end, and equality with the angels, <span
id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341.md) from which promise we are certified
that when after judgment we shall have come to that life, we shall not
fall from it; but if the angels are ignorant of this truth concerning
themselves, we shall not be their equals, but more blessed than they.
But the Truth has promised us equality with them. It is certain, then,
that they have known this by sight, which we have known by faith, to
wit, that there shall be now no more any fall of any holy angel. But the
devil and his angels, although they were blessed before they fell, and
did not know that they should fall unto misery,—there was still
something which might be added to their blessedness, if by free will
they had stood in the truth, until they should receive that fulness of
the highest blessing as the reward of that continuance; that is, that by
the great abundance of the love of God, given by the Holy Spirit, they
should absolutely not be able to fall any more, and that they should
know this with complete certainty concerning themselves. They had not
this plenitude of blessedness; but since they were ignorant of their
future misery, they enjoyed a blessedness which was less, indeed, but
still without any defect. For if they had known their future fall and
eternal punishment, they certainly could not have been blessed; since
the fear of so great an evil as this would compel them even then to be
miserable.
