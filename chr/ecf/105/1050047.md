<span id="x.iii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XXI.\]—It is an Inscrutable
Mystery Why Some are Saved, and Others Not.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxix-p2"></span>Now there is much significance in that
He does not say, “The wrath of God *shall come* upon him,” but
“*abideth* on him.” For from this wrath (in which we are all involved
under sin, and of which the apostle says, “For we too were once by
nature <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span
id="x.iii.xxix-Page_26"></span>the children of wrath, even as
others” <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295) .md) nothing delivers us
but the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. The reason why this
grace comes upon one man and not on another may be hidden, but it cannot
be unjust. For “is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.” <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) But we must first bend our necks to
the authority of the Holy Scriptures, in order that we may each arrive
at knowledge and understanding through faith. For it is not said in
vain, “Thy judgments are a great deep.” <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) The profundity of this “deep” the
apostle, as if with a feeling of dread, notices in that exclamation: “O
the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!” He
had indeed previously pointed out the meaning of this marvellous depth,
when he said: “For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that He
might have mercy upon all.” <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) Then
struck, as it were, with a horrible fear of this deep: “O the depth of
the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable
are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! For who hath known the
mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor?or who hath first
given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of Him,
and through Him, and in Him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.
Amen.” <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) How utterly
insignificant, then, is our faculty for discussing the justice of God’s
judgments, and for the consideration of His gratuitous grace, which, as
men have no prevenient merits for deserving it, cannot be partial or
unrighteous, and which does not disturb us when it is bestowed upon
unworthy men, as much as when it is denied to those who are equally
unworthy!
