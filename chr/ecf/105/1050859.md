id="xviii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[VIII.\]—Even the Desire of
an Imperfect Good is a Gift of Grace, Otherwise Grace Would Be Given
According to Merits.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xvii-p2"></span>Let us now see, as we can, the nature
of this thing which they will have to precede in man, in order that he
may be regarded as worthy of the assistance of grace, and to the merit
of which in him grace is not given as if unearned, but is rendered as
due; and thus grace is no more grace. Let us see, however, what this is.
“Under the name,” say they, “of grace, they so assert fate as to say
that unless God should have inspired the desire for good, and that,
imperfect good, into unwilling and resisting man, he would neither be
able to decline from evil nor to grasp after good.” I have already shown
what empty things they speak about fate and grace. Now the question
which I ought to consider is this, whether God inspires the desire of
good into unwilling and resisting man, that he may be no longer
unwilling, no longer resisting, but consenting to the good and willing
the good. For those men will have it that the desire of good in man
begins from man himself; that the merit of this beginning is, moreover,
attended with the grace of completion—if, at least, they will allow so
much as even this. For Pelagius says that what is good is “more easily”
fulfilled if grace assists. <span id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653)
By which addition—that is, by adding “more easily”—he certainly
signifies that he is of the opinion that, even if the aid of grace
should be wanting, yet good might be accomplished, although with greater
difficulty, by free will. But let me prescribe to my present opponents
what they should think in this matter, without speaking of the author of
this heresy himself. Let us allow them, with their free will, to be free
even from Pelagius himself, and rather give heed to their words which
they have written in this letter to which I am replying.
