<span id="xii.lxxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 77.—Xystus.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxxi-p2"></span>What Christian, again, is unaware of what
he quotes the most blessed Xystus, bishop of Rome and martyr of Christ,
as having said, “God has conferred upon men liberty of their own will,
in order that by purity and sinlessness of life they may become like
unto God?” <span id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) But the man who
appeals to free will ought to listen and believe, and ask Him in whom he
believes to give him His assistance not to sin. For when he speaks of
“becoming like unto God,” it is indeed through God’s love that men are
to be like unto God,—even the love which is “shed abroad in our hearts,”
not by any ability of nature or the free will within us, but “by the
Holy Ghost which is given unto us.” <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) Then, in respect of what the same
martyr further says, “A pure mind is a holy temple for God, and a heart
clean and without sin is His best altar,” who knows not that the clean
heart must be brought to this perfection, whilst “the inward man is
renewed day by day,” <span id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) but yet
not without the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord? Again, when
he says, “A man of chastity and without sin has received power from God
to be a son of God,” he of course meant it as an admonition that on a
man’s becoming so chaste and sinless (without raising any question as to
where and when this perfection was to be obtained by him,—although in
fact it is quite an interesting question among godly men, who are
notwithstanding agreed as to the possibility of such perfection on the
one hand, and on the other hand its impossibility except through “the
one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus”); <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) —nevertheless, as I began to say,
Xystus designed his words to be an admonition that, on any man’s
attaining such a high character, and thereby being rightly reckoned to
be among the sons of God, the attainment must not be thought to have
been the work of his own power. This indeed he, through grace, received
from God, since he did not have it in a nature which had become
corrupted and depraved,—even as we read in the Gospel, “But as many as
received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God;” <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) which they were not by nature, nor
could at all become, unless by receiving Him they also received power
through His grace. This is the power which is claimed for itself by the
fortitude of that love which is only communicated to us by the Holy
Ghost bestowed upon us.
