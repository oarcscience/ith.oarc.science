<span id="xx.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—God’s Ways Past Finding Out.</span>

<span id="xx.xxii-p2"></span>Nor let us wonder that we cannot trace His
unsearchable ways. For, to say nothing of innumerable other things which
are given by the Lord God to some men, and to others are not given,
since with Him is no respect of persons; such things as are not
conferred on the merits of will, as bodily swiftness, strength, good
health, and beauty of body, marvellous intellects and mental natures
capable of many arts, or such as fall to man’s lot from without, such as
are wealth, nobility, honours, and other things of this kind, which it
is in the power of God alone that a man should have; not to dwell even
on the baptism of infants (which none of those objectors can say does
not pertain, as might be said of those other matters, to the kingdom of
God), why it is given to this infant and not given to that, since both
of them are equally in God’s power, and without that sacrament none can
enter into the kingdom of God;—to be silent, then, on these matters, or
to leave them on one side, let men consider those very special cases of
which we are treating. For we are discoursing of such as have not
perseverance in goodness, but die in the decline of their good will from
good to evil. Let the objectors answer, if they can, why, when these
were living faithfully and piously, God did not then snatch them from
the perils of this life, “lest wickedness should change their
understanding, and lest deceit should beguile their souls”? <span
id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306.md) Had He not this in His power, or
was He ignorant of their future sinfulness? Assuredly, nothing of this
kind is said, except most perversely and insanely. Why, then, did He not
do this? Let them reply who mock at us when in such matters we exclaim,
“How inscrutable are His judgments, and His ways past finding
out!” <span id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307.md) For either God giveth
this to whom He will, or certainly that Scripture is wrong which says
concerning the immature death of the righteous man, “He was taken away
lest wickedness should change his understanding, or lest deceit should
beguile his soul.” <span id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308.md) Why, then,
does God give this so great benefit to some, and not give it to others,
seeing that in Him is no unrighteousness <span
id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309.md) nor acceptance of persons, <span
id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310.md) and that it is in His power how
long every one may remain in this life, which is called a trial upon
earth? <span id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311.md) As, then, they are
constrained to confess that it is God’s gift for a man to end this life
of his before it can be changed from good to evil, but they do not know
why it is given to some and not given to others, so let them confess
with us that perseverance in good is God’s gift, according to the
Scriptures, from which I have already set down many testimonies; and let
them condescend with us to be ignorant, without a murmur against God,
why it is given to some and not given to others.
