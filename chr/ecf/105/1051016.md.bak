<span id="xx.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—The Gifts of Grace Conferred on
Adam in Creation.</span>

<span id="xx.xxxv-p2"></span>At that time, therefore, God had given to
man a good will, <span id="fr_3354"></span>[3355](#fn_3354.md) because in
that will He had made him, since He had made him upright. He had given
help without which he could not continue therein if he would; but that
he should will, He left in his free will. He could therefore continue if
he would, because the help was not wanting whereby he could, and without
which he could not, perseveringly hold fast the good which he would. But
that he willed not to continue is absolutely the fault of him whose
merit it would have been if he had willed to continue; as the holy
angels did, who, while others fell by free will, themselves by the same
free will stood, and deserved to receive the due reward of this
continuance—to wit, such a fulness of blessing that by it they might
have the fullest certainty of always abiding in it. If, however, this
help <span id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span
id="xx.xxxv-Page_485"></span>had been wanting, either to angel or to man
when they were first made, since their nature was not made such that
without the divine help it could abide if it would, they certainly would
not have fallen by their own fault, because the help would have been
wanting without which they could not continue. At the present time,
however, to those to whom such assistance is wanting, it is the penalty
of sin; but to those to whom it is given, it is given of grace, not of
debt; and by so much the more is given through Jesus Christ our Lord to
those to whom it has pleased God to give it, that not only we have that
help without which we cannot continue even if we will, but, moreover, we
have so great and such a help as to *will.* Because by this grace of God
there is caused in us, in the reception of good and in the persevering
hold of it, not only to be able to do what we will, but even to will to
do what we are able. But this was not the case in the first man; for the
one of these things was in him, but the other was not. For he did not
need grace to receive good, because he had not yet lost it; but he
needed the aid of grace to continue in it, and without this aid he could
not do this at all; and he had received the ability if he would, but he
had not the will for what he could; for if he had possessed it, he would
have persevered. For he could persevere if he would; but that he would
not was the result of free will, which at that time was in such wise
free that he was capable of willing well and ill. For what shall be more
free than free will, when it shall not be able to serve sin? and this
should be to man also as it was made to the holy angels, the reward of
deserving. But now that good deserving has been lost by sin, in those
who are delivered that has become the gift of grace which would have
been the reward of deserving.
