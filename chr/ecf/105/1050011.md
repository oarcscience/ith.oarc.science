The Right Reverend The Lord Bishop OF Exeter.</span>

<span id="vi-p4"></span><span class="c16"><span id="vi-p4.1"></span>My
Dear Lord</span>,—I gladly avail myself of your permission to dedicate
this volume to you. In the course of a professional life of nearly the
third of a century, which has not been idly spent, I have never failed
to find pleasure in theological pursuits. In the intervals of most
pressing labour, these have often tended to refresh and comfort one’s
wearied spirit. If this confession of my own experience should have any
weight with any one in our sacred calling to combine the hard work which
we owe to others while ministering to their wants, with “that diligent
attendance to reading” which we require for ourselves, to inform our
minds and refresh our spirits, I shall have accomplished my only purpose
in making it. Your Lordship, I am sure, will entirely approve of such a
combination of employments in your clergy. I well remember your
recommendation of theological study to us at the opening of Bishop
Phillpott’s Library at Truro; and how you counselled us the more
earnestly to pursue it, from the danger there is, in these busy times,
of merging the acquisition of sacred learning in the active labours of
our holy vocation. That the divine blessing may crown the work which you
are so diligently prosecuting in the several functions of your high
office, is the earnest wish, my dear Lord, of your faithful servant,
