<span id="v.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="v.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>IV. The Theology of Grace.</span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p2"></span>The theology which Augustin opposed, in his
anti-Pelagian writings, to the errors of Pelagianism, is, shortly, the
theology of grace. Its roots were planted deeply in his own experience,
and in the teachings of Scripture, especially of that apostle whom he
delights to call “the great preacher of grace,” and to follow whom, in
his measure, was his greatest desire. The grace of God in Jesus Christ,
conveyed to us by the Holy Spirit and evidenced by the love that He
sheds abroad in our hearts, is the centre around which this whole
side <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) of His system revolves, and
the germ out of which it grows. He was the more able to make it thus
central because of the harmony of this view of salvation with the
general principle of his whole theology, which was theocentric and
revolved around his conception of God as the immanent and vital spirit
in whom all things live and move and have their being. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) In like manner, God is the absolute
good, and all good is either Himself or from Him; and only as God makes
us good, are we able to do anything good.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p5"></span>The *necessity of grace* to man, Augustin
argued from the condition of the race as partakers of Adam’s sin. God
created man upright, and endowed him with human faculties, including
free <span id="page_lxvii">p. lxvii</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_lxvii"></span>will; <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) and gave to him freely that grace by
which he was able to retain his uprightness. <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) Being thus put on probation, <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) with divine aid to enable him to stand
if he chose, Adam used his free choice for sinning, and involved his
whole race in his fall. <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) It was
on account of this sin that he died physically and spiritually, and this
double death passes over from him to us. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) That all his descendants by ordinary
generation are partakers in Adam’s guilt and condemnation, Augustin is
sure from the teachings of Scripture; and this is the fact of original
sin, from which no one generated from Adam is free, and from which no
one is freed save as regenerated in Christ. <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) But how we are made partakers of it,
he is less certain: sometimes he speaks as if it came by some mysterious
unity of the race, so that we were all personally present in the
individual Adam, and thus the whole race was the one man that
sinned; <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) sometimes he speaks more
in the sense of modern realists, as if Adam’s sin corrupted the nature,
and the nature now corrupts those to whom it is communicated; <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) sometimes he speaks as if it were due
to simple heredity; <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) sometimes,
again, as if it depended on the presence of shameful concupiscence in
the act of procreation, so that the propagation of guilt depends on the
propagation of offspring by means of concupiscence. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) However transmitted, it is yet a fact
that sin is propagated, and all mankind became sinners in Adam. The
result of this is that we have lost the divine image, though not in such
a sense that no lineaments of it remain to us; <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) and, the sinning soul making the flesh
corruptible, our whole nature is corrupted, and we are unable to do
anything of ourselves truly good. <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) This includes, of course, an injury to
our will. Augustin, writing for the popular eye, treats this subject in
popular language. But it is clear that he distinguished, in his
thinking, between will as a faculty and will in a broader sense. As a
mere faculty, will is and always remains an indifferent thing, <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) —after the fall, as before it,
continuing poised in indifferency, and ready, like a weathercock, to be
turned whithersoever the breeze that blows from the heart (“will,” in
the broader sense) may direct. <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md)
It is not the faculty of willing, but the man who makes use of that
faculty, that has suffered change from the fall. In paradise man stood
in full ability: he had the *posse non peccare*, but not yet the *non
posse peccare*; <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) that is, he was
endowed with a capacity for either part, and possessed the grace of God
by which he was able to stand if he would, but also the power of free
will by which he might fall if he would. By his fall he has suffered a
change, is corrupt, and under the power of Satan; his will (in the
broader sense) is now injured, wounded, diseased, enslaved,—although the
faculty of will (in the narrow sense) remains indifferent. <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) Augustin’s criticism of Pelagius’
discrimination <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) of “capacity”
(*possibilitas, posse*), “will” (*voluntas, velle*), and “act” (*actio,
esse*), does not turn on the discrimination itself, but on the
incongruity of placing the *power, ability* in the mere capacity or
possibility, rather than in the living agent who “wills” and “acts.” He
himself adopts an essentially similar distribution, with only this
correction; <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) and thus keeps the
faculty of will indifferent, but places the power of using it in the
active agent, man. According, then, to the character of this *man*, will
the use of the free will be. If the man be holy he will make a holy use
of it, and if he be corrupt he will make a sinful use of it: if he be
essentially holy, he cannot (like God Himself) make a sinful use of his
will; and if he be enslaved to sin, he cannot make a good use of it. The
last is the present condition of men by nature. They have free
will; <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) the faculty by which they
act remains in indifferency, and they are allowed to use it just as they
choose: but such as they cannot desire and therefore cannot choose
anything but evil; <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) and therefore
they, and therefore their choice, and therefore their willing, is always
<span id="page_lxviii">p. lxviii</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_lxviii"></span>evil and never good. They are thus the
slaves of sin, which they obey; and while their free will avails for
sinning, it does not avail for doing any good unless they be first freed
by the grace of God. It is undeniable that this view is in consonance
with modern psychology: let us once conceive of “the will” as simply the
whole man in the attitude of willing, and it is immediately evident,
that, however abstractly free the “will” is, it is conditioned and
enslaved in all its action by the character of the willing agent: a bad
man does not cease to be bad in the act of willing, and a good man
remains good even in his acts of choice.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p26"></span>*In its nature*, grace is assistance, help
from God; and all divine aid may be included under the term,—as well
what may be called natural, as what may be called spiritual, aid. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) Spiritual grace includes, no doubt,
all external help that God gives man for working out his salvation, such
as the law, the preaching of the gospel, the example of Christ, by which
we may learn the right way; it includes also forgiveness of sins, by
which we are freed from the guilt already incurred; but above all it
includes that help which God gives by His Holy Spirit, working within,
not without, by which man is enabled to choose and to do what he sees,
by the teachings of the law, or by the gospel, or by the natural
conscience, to be right. <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) Within
this aid are included all those spiritual exercises which we call
regeneration, justification, perseverance to the end,—in a word, all the
divine assistance by which, in being made Christians, we are made to
differ from other men. Augustin is fond of representing this grace as in
essence the writing of God’s law (or of God’s will) on our hearts, so
that it appears hereafter as our own desire and wish; and even more
prevalently as the shedding abroad of love in our hearts by the Holy
Ghost, given to us in Christ Jesus; therefore, as a change of
disposition, by which we come to love and freely choose, in co-operation
with God’s aid, just the things which hitherto we have been unable to
choose because in bondage to sin. Grace, thus, does not make void free
will: <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) it acts through free will,
and acts upon it only by liberating it from its bondage to sin, i.e., by
liberating the agent that uses the free will, so that he is no longer
enslaved by his fleshly lusts, and is enabled to make use of his free
will in choosing the good; and thus it is only by grace that free will
is enabled to act in good part. But just because grace changes the
disposition, and so enables man, hitherto enslaved to sin, for the first
time to desire and use his free will for good, it lies in the very
nature of the case that it is *prevenient*. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) Also, as the very name imports, it is
necessarily *gratuitous*; <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) since
man is enslaved to sin until it is given, all the merits that he can
have prior to it are bad merits, and deserve punishment, not gifts of
favour. When, then, it is asked, *on the ground of what*, grace is
given, it can only be answered, “on the ground of God’s infinite mercy
and undeserved favour.” <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) There is
nothing in man to merit it, and it first gives merit of good to man. All
men alike deserve death, and all that comes to them in the way of
blessing is necessarily of God’s free and unmerited favour. This is
equally true of all grace. It is pre-eminently clear of that grace which
gives faith, the root of all other graces, which is given of God, not to
merits of good-will or incipient turning to Him, but of His sovereign
good pleasure. <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) But equally with
faith, it is true of all other divine gifts: we may, indeed, speak of
“merits of good” as succeeding faith; but as all these merits find their
root in faith, they are but “grace on grace,” and men need God’s mercy
always, throughout this life, and even on the judgment day itself, when,
if they are judged without mercy, they must be condemned. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) If we ask, then, why God gives grace,
we can only answer that it is of His unspeakable mercy; and if we ask
why He gives it to one rather than to another, what can we answer but
that it is of His will? The *sovereignty* of grace results from its very
gratuitousness: <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) where none
deserve it, it can be given only of the sovereign good pleasure of the
great Giver,—and this is necessarily inscrutable, but cannot be unjust.
We can faintly perceive, indeed, some reasons why God may be supposed
not <span id="page_lxix">p. lxix</span> <span
id="v.ii.iv-Page_lxix"></span>to have chosen to give His saving grace to
all, <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) or even to the most; <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) but we cannot understand why He has
chosen to give it to just the individuals to whom He has given it, and
to withhold it from just those from whom He has withheld it. Here we are
driven to the apostle’s cry, “Oh the depth of the riches both of the
mercy and the justice of God!” <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md)

<span id="v.ii.iv-p39"></span>The *effects of grace* are according to
its nature. Taken as a whole, it is the recreative principle sent forth
from God for the recovery of man from his slavery to sin, and for his
reformation in the divine image. Considered as to the time of its
giving, it is either *operating* or *co-operating* grace, i.e., either
the grace that first enables the will to choose the good, or the grace
that co-operates with the already enabled will to do the good; and it
is, therefore, also called either *prevenient* or *subsequent*
grace. <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) It is not to be conceived
of as a series of disconnected divine gifts, but as a constant efflux
from God; but we may look upon it in the various steps of its operation
in men, as bringing forgiveness of sins, faith, which is the beginning
of all good, love to God, progressive power of good working, and
perseverance to the end. <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) In any
case, and in all its operations alike, just because it is power from on
high and the living spring of a new and re-created life, it is
*irresistible* and *indefectible*. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) Those on whom the Lord bestows the
gift of faith working from within, not from without, of course, have
faith, and cannot help believing. Those to whom perseverance to the end
is given must persevere to the end. It is not to be objected to this,
that many seem to begin well who do not persevere: this also is of God,
who has in such cases given great blessings indeed, but not *this*
blessing, of perseverance to the end. Whatever of good men have, that
God has given; and what they have not, why, of course, God has not given
it. Nor can it be objected, that this leaves all uncertain: it is only
unknown to us, but this is not uncertainty; we cannot know that we are
to have any gift which God sovereignly gives, of course, until it is
given, and we therefore cannot know that we have perseverance unto the
end until we actually persevere to the end; <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) but who would call what God does, and
knows He is to do, uncertain, and what man is to do certain? Nor will it
do to say that thus nothing is left for us to do: no doubt, all things
are in God’s hands, and we should praise God that this is so, but we
must co-operate with Him; and it is just because it is He that is
working in us the willing and the doing, that it is worth our while to
work out our salvation with fear and trembling. God has not determined
the end without determining the appointed means. <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md)

<span id="v.ii.iv-p45"></span>Now, Augustin argues, since grace
certainly is gratuitous, and given to no preceding merits,—prevenient
and antecedent to all good,—and, therefore, sovereign, and bestowed only
on those whom God selects for its reception; we must, of course, believe
that the eternal God has foreknown all this from the beginning. He would
be something less than God, had He not foreknown that He intended to
bestow this prevenient, gratuitous, and sovereign grace on some men, and
had He not foreknown equally the precise individuals on whom He intended
to bestow it. To foreknow is to prepare beforehand. And this is
*predestination.* <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) He argues that
there can be no objection to predestination, in itself considered, in
the mind of any man who believes in a God: what men object to is the
gratuitous and sovereign grace to which no additional difficulty is
added by the necessary assumption that it was foreknown and prepared for
from eternity. That predestination does not proceed on the foreknowledge
of good or of faith, <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) follows
from its being nothing more than the foresight and preparation of grace,
which, in its very idea, is gratuitous and not according to any merits,
sovereign and according only to God’s purpose, prevenient and in order
to faith and good works. It is the sovereignty of grace, not its
foresight or the preparation for it, which places men in God’s hands,
and suspends salvation absolutely on his unmerited <span
id="page_lxx">p. lxx</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_lxx"></span>mercy.
But just because God is God, of course, no one receives grace who has
not been foreknown and afore-selected for the gift; and, as much of
course, no one who has been foreknown and afore-selected for it, fails
to receive it. Therefore the number of the predestinated is fixed, and
fixed by God. <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) Is this fate? Men
may call God’s grace fate if they choose; but it is not fate, but
undeserved love and tender mercy, without which none would be
saved. <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) Does it paralyze effort?
Only to those who will not strive to obey God because obedience is His
gift. Is it unjust? Far from it: shall not God do what He will with His
own undeserved favour? It is nothing but gratuitous mercy, sovereignly
distributed, and foreseen and provided for from all eternity by Him who
has selected us in His Son.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p50"></span>When Augustin comes to speak of *the means
of grace,* i.e., of the channels and circumstances of its conference to
men, he approaches the meeting point of two very dissimilar streams of
his theology,—his doctrine of grace and his doctrine of the Church,—and
he is sadly deflected from the natural course of his theology by the
alien influence. He does not, indeed, bind the conference of grace to
the means in such a sense that the grace must be given at the exact time
of the application of the means. He does not deny that “God is able,
even when no man rebukes, to correct whom He will, and to lead him on to
the wholesome mortification of repentance by the most hidden and most
mighty power of His medicine.” <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md)
Though the Gospel must be known in order that man may be saved <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) (for how shall they believe without a
preacher?), yet the preacher is nothing, and the preachment is nothing,
but God only that gives the increase. <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) He even has something like a distant
glimpse of what has since been called the distinction between the
visible and invisible Church,—speaking of men not yet born as among
those who are “called according to God’s purpose,” and, therefore, of
the saved who constitute the Church, <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) —asserting that those who are so
called, even before they believe, are “already children of God enrolled
in the memorial of their Father with unchangeable surety,” <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) and, at the same time, allowing that
there are many already in the visible Church who are not of it, and who
can therefore depart from it. But he teaches that those who are thus
lost out of the visible Church are lost because of some fatal flaw in
their baptism, or on account of post-baptismal sins; and that those who
are of the “called according to the purpose” are predestinated not only
to salvation, but to salvation by baptism. Grace is not tied to the
means in the sense that it is not conferred save in the means; but it is
tied to the means in the sense that it is not conferred without the
means. Baptism, for instance, is absolutely necessary for salvation: no
exception is allowed except such as save the principle,—baptism of blood
(martyrdom), <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) and, somewhat
grudgingly, baptism of intention. And baptism, when worthily received,
is absolutely efficacious: “if a man were to die immediately after
baptism, he would have nothing at all left to hold him liable to
punishment.” <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) In a word, while
there are many baptized who will not be saved, there are none saved who
have not been baptized; it is the grace of God that saves, but baptism
is a channel of grace without which none receive it. <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md)

<span id="v.ii.iv-p59"></span>The saddest corollary that flowed from
this doctrine was that by which Augustin was forced to assert that all
those who died unbaptized, including infants, are finally lost and
depart into eternal punishment. He did not shrink from the inference,
although he assigned the place of lightest punishment in hell to those
who were guilty of no sin but original sin, but who had departed this
life without having washed this away in the “laver of regeneration.”
This is the dark side of his soteriology; but it should be remembered
that it was not his theology of grace, but the universal and traditional
belief in the necessity of baptism for remission of sins, which he
inherited in common with all of his time, that forced it upon him. The
theology of grace was destined in <span id="page_lxxi">p. lxxi</span>
<span id="v.ii.iv-Page_lxxi"></span>the hands of his successors, who
have rejoiced to confess that they were taught by him, to remove this
stumbling-block also from Christian teaching; and if not to Augustin, it
is to Augustin’s theology that the Christian world owes its liberation
from so terrible and incredible a tenet. Along with the doctrine of
infant damnation, another stumbling-block also, not so much of
Augustinian, but of Church theology, has gone. It was not because of his
theology of grace, or of his doctrine of predestination, that Augustin
taught that comparatively few of the human race are saved. It was,
again, because he believed that baptism and incorporation into the
visible Church were necessary for salvation. And it is only because of
Augustin’s theology of grace, which places man in the hands of an
all-merciful Saviour and not in the grasp of a human institution, that
men can see that in the salvation of all who die in infancy, the
invisible Church of God embraces the vast majority of the human
race,—saved not by the washing of water administered by the Church, but
by the blood of Christ administered by God’s own hand outside of the
ordinary channels of his grace. We are indeed born in sin, and those
that die in infancy are, in Adam, children of wrath even as others; but
God’s hand is not shortened by the limits of His Church on earth, that
it cannot save. In Christ Jesus, all souls are the Lord’s, and only the
soul that itself sinneth shall die ([Ezek. xviii.
1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001)<span id="v.ii.iv-p59.1"></span>.md);
and the only judgment wherewith men shall be judged proceeds on the
principle that as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
without law, and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by the
law ([Rev. ii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.ii.iv-p59.2"></span>).

<span id="v.ii.iv-p60"></span>Thus, although Augustin’s theology had a
very strong churchly element within it, it was, on the side that is
presented in the controversy against Pelagianism, distinctly
anti-ecclesiastical. Its central thought was the absolute dependence of
the individual on the grace of God in Jesus Christ. It made everything
that concerned salvation to be of God, and traced the source of all good
to Him. “Without me ye can do nothing,” is the inscription on one side
of it; on the other stands written, “All things are yours.” Augustin
held that he who builds on a human foundation builds on sand, and
founded all his hope on the Rock itself. And there also he founded his
teaching; as he distrusted man in the matter of salvation, so he
distrusted him in the form of theology. No other of the fathers so
conscientiously wrought out his theology from the revealed Word; no
other of them so sternly excluded human additions. The subjects of which
theology treats, he declares, are such as “we could by no means find out
unless we believed them on the testimony of Holy Scripture.” <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) “Where Scripture gives no certain
testimony,” he says, “human presumption must beware how it decides in
favor of either side.” <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) “We must
first bend our necks to the authority of Scripture,” he insists, “in
order that we may arrive at knowledge and understanding through
faith.” <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) And this was not merely
his theory, but his practice. <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) No
theology was ever, it may be more broadly asserted, more conscientiously
wrought out from the Scriptures. Is it without error? No; but its errors
are on the surface, not of the essence. It leads to God, and it came
from God; and in the midst of the controversies of so many ages it has
shown itself an edifice whose solid core is built out of material “which
cannot be shaken.” <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md)

id="v.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p3"></span> This is a necessary limitation, for there
is another side—a churchly side—of Augustin’s theology, which was only
laid alongside of, and artificially combined with, his theology of
grace. This was the traditional element in his teaching, but was far
from the determining or formative element. As Thomasius truly points out
(*Dogmengeschichte*, i. 495), both his experience and the Scriptures
stood with him above tradition.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[lxvi:143](1050010.htm#fr_142.md) <span
id="v.ii.iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p4"></span> It is only one of the strange assertions
in Professor Allen’s *Continuity of Christian Thought*, that he makes
“the Augustinian theology rest upon the transcendence of Deity as its
controlling principle” (p. 3), which is identified with “a tacit
assumption of deism” (p. 171), and explained to include a “localization
of God as a physical essence in the infinite remoteness,” “separated
from the world by infinite reaches of space.” As a matter of mere fact,
Augustin’s conception of God was that of an immanent Spirit, and his
tendency was consequently distinctly towards a pantheistic rather than a
deistic view of His relation to His creatures. Nor is this true only “at
a certain stage of his career” (p. 6), which is but Professor Allen’s
attempt to reconcile fact with his theory, but of his whole life and all
his teaching. He, no doubt, did not so teach the Divine immanence as to
make God the author of the *form* as well as the *matter* of all acts of
His creatures, or to render it impossible for His creatures to turn from
Him; this would be to pass the limits that separate the conception of
Christian immanence from pure pantheism, and to make God the author of
sin, and all His creatures but manifestations of Himself.

compare Reuter’s *Augustinische Studien*, which has come to hand only

matters—such as the formative principle, the sources, and the main
outlines of Augustin’s theology—is in substantial agreement with what is
here said.
