Above in Book II. 11 \[VII.\].)</span>

<span id="xvii.vi.ix-p2"></span>Again, do not, I pray you, believe, say,
or teach that “the soul deservedly lost something by the flesh, although
it was of good merit previous to the flesh,” if you wish to be a
catholic. For the apostle declares that “children who are not yet born,
have done neither good nor evil.” <span
id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) How, therefore, could their soul,
previous to its participation of flesh, have had anything like good
desert, if it had not done any good thing? Will you by any chance
venture to assert that it had, previous to the flesh, lived a good life,
when you cannot actually prove to us that it even existed at all? How,
then, can you say: “You will not allow that the soul contracts health
from the sinful flesh; and to this holy state, then, you can see it in
due course pass, with the view of amending its condition, through that
very flesh by which it had lost merit”? Perhaps you are not aware that
these opinions, which attribute to the human soul a good state and a
good merit previous to the flesh, have been already condemned by the
catholic Church, not only in the case of some ancient heretics, whom I
do not here mention, but also more recently in the instance of the
Priscillianists.
