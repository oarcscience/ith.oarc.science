<span id="xx.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46 \[XV.\]—Rebuke Must Be Varied
According to the Variety of Faults. There is No Punishment in the Church
Greater Than Excommunication.</span>

<span id="xx.xlix-p2"></span>Therefore, let brethren who are subject be
rebuked by those who are set over them, with rebukes that spring from
love, varied according to the diversity of faults, whether smaller or
greater. Because that very penalty that is called condemnation, <span
id="fr_3398"></span>[3399](#fn_3398) which episcopal judgment inflicts,
than which there is no greater punishment in the Church, may, if God
will, result and be of advantage for most wholesome rebuke. For we know
not what may happen on the coming day; nor must any one be despaired of
before the end of this life; nor can God be contradicted, that He may
not look down and give repentance, and receive the sacrifice of a
troubled spirit and a contrite heart, and absolve from the guilt of
condemnation, however just, and so Himself not condemn the condemned
person. Yet the necessity of the pastoral office requires, in order that
the terrible contagion may not creep through the many, that the diseased
sheep should be separated from the sound ones; perchance, by that very
separation, to be healed by Him to whom nothing is impossible. For as we
know not who belongs to the number of the predestinated, we ought in
such wise to be influenced by the affection of love as to will all men
to be saved. For this is the case when we endeavour to lead every
individual to that point where they may meet with those agencies by
which we may prevail, to the accomplishment of the result, that being
justified by faith they may have peace with God, <span
id="fr_3399"></span>[3400](#fn_3399) —which peace, moreover, the apostle
announced when he said, “Therefore, we discharge an embassage for
Christ, as though God were exhorting by us, we pray you in Christ’s
stead to be reconciled to God.” <span
id="fr_3400"></span>[3401](#fn_3400) For what is “to be reconciled” to
Him but to have peace with Him? For the sake of which peace, moreover,
the Lord Jesus Christ Himself said to His disciples, “Into whatsoever
house ye enter first, say, Peace be to this house; and if the son of
peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall
return to you again.” <span id="fr_3401"></span>[3402](#fn_3401) When
they preach the gospel of this peace of whom it is predicted, “How
beautiful are the feet of those that publish peace, that announce good
things!” <span id="fr_3402"></span>[3403](#fn_3402) to us, indeed, every
one then begins to be a son of peace who obeys and believes this gospel,
and who, being justified by faith, has begun to have peace towards God;
but, according to God’s predestination, he was already a son of peace.
For it was not said, Upon whomsoever your peace shall rest, he shall
become a son of peace; but Christ says, “If the son of peace be there,
your peace shall rest upon that house.” Already, therefore, and before
the announcement of that peace to him, the son of peace was there, as he
had been known and foreknown, by—not the evangelist, but—God. For we
need not fear lest we should lose it, if in our ignorance he to whom we
preach is not a son of peace, for it will return to us again—that is,
that preaching will profit us, and not him; but if the peace <span
id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span
id="xx.xlix-Page_491"></span>proclaimed shall rest upon him, it will
profit both us and him.
