<span id="xiv.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—The Same Continued.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxix-p2"></span>“What, then, is the meaning of that which
the same apostle says: ‘I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give
me at that day;’ <span id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712.md) if these are
not recompenses paid to the worthy, but gifts, bestowed on the
unworthy?” He who says this, does not consider that the crown could not
have been given to the man who is worthy of it, unless grace had been
first bestowed on him whilst unworthy of it. He says indeed: “I have
fought a good fight;” <span id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713.md) but
then he also says: “Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through
Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714.md) He
says too: “I have finished my course;” but he says again: “It is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
mercy.” <span id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) He says, moreover: “I
have kept the faith;” but then it is he too who says again: “I know whom
I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep my deposit
against that day”—that is, “my commendation;” for some copies have not
the word *depositum*, but *commendatum*, which yields a plainer
sense. <span id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) Now, what do we
commend to God’s keeping, except the things which we pray Him to
preserve for us, and amongst these our very faith? For what else did the
Lord procure for the Apostle Peter by His prayer for him, <span
id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) of which He said, “I have prayed
for thee, Peter, that thy faith fail not,” <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) than that God would preserve his
faith, that it should not fail by giving way to temptation? Therefore,
blessed Paul, thou great preacher of grace, I will say it without fear
of any man (for who will be less angry with me for so saying than
thyself, who hast told us what to say, and taught us what to teach?)—I
will, I repeat, say it, and fear no man for the assertion: Their own
crown is recompensed to their merits; but thy merits are the gifts of
God!

St. Paul’s phrase, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.xxxix-p7.2"></span>τῆν παραθήκην μου</span>, has been taken in
two senses, as (1) what God had entrusted to him; and (2) what the
apostle had entrusted to God’s keeping. St. Augustin, it will be seen,
here takes the latter sense.

<span id="fn_1717"></span>[199:1718](1050420.htm#fr_1717.md) <span
id="xiv.xxxix-p7.3"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxix-p8"></span> There seems to be a corruption in the
text here: “*Quid aliud apostolo Petro Dominus commendavit orando*.”
Another reading inserts *de* before the word *apostolo*. Our version is
rather of the apparent sense than of the words of the passage.
