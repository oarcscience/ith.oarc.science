id="xxi.iii.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 59.—Offence to Be Avoided.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lxi-p2"></span>Neither is what follows by any means to
be said,—that is, “But others of you who abide in the delight of sins
have not yet arisen, because the aid of pitying grace has not yet lifted
you up;” when it may be and ought to be well and conveniently said, “But
if any of you are still delaying in the delightfulness of damnable sins,
lay hold of the most wholesome discipline; and yet when you have done
this be not lifted up, as if by your own works, nor boast as if you had
not received this. For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to
do for His good will, <span id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699.md) and
your steps are directed by the Lord, so that you choose His way. <span
id="fr_3700"></span>[3701](#fn_3700.md) But of your own good and righteous
course, learn carefully that it is attributable to the predestination of
divine grace.”
