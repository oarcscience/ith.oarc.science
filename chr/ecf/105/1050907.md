<span id="xviii.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—The Testimonies of Scripture
in Favour of Grace.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xiv-p2"></span>For that very pride has so stopped the
ears of their heart that they do not hear, “For what hast thou that thou
hast not received?” <span id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md) They do
not hear, “Without me ye can do nothing;” <span
id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813.md) they do not hear, “Love is of
God;” <span id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814.md) they do not hear, “God
hath dealt the measure of faith;” <span
id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815.md) they do not hear, “The Spirit
breatheth where it will,” <span id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md)
and, “They who are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
God;” <span id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) they do not hear, “No
one can come unto me, unless it were given him of my Father;” <span
id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) they do not hear what Esdras
writes, “Blessed is the Lord of our fathers, who hath put into the heart
of the king to glorify His house which is in Jerusalem;” <span
id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) they do not hear what the Lord says
by Jeremiah, “And I will put my fear into their heart, that they depart
not from me; and I will visit them to make them good;” <span
id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) and specially that word by Ezekiel
the prophet, where God fully shows that He is induced by no good
deservings of men to make them good, that is, obedient to His commands,
but rather that He repays to them good for evil, by doing this for His
own sake, and not for theirs. For He says, “These things saith the Lord
God: I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine own
holy name’s sake, which has been profaned among the nations, whither ye
have gone in there; and I will sanctify my great name, which has been
profaned among the nations, and which ye have profaned in the midst of
them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, saith Adonai the
Lord, when I shall be sanctified among you before their eyes. And I will
take you from among the nations, and gather you together out of all
lands, and will bring you into your own land. And I will sprinkle upon
you clean water, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and
I will cleanse you. And I will give unto you a new heart, and a new
spirit will I put within you: and the stony heart shall be taken away
out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put
my Spirit within you, and will cause you to walk in my righteousness,
and to observe my judgments, and do them.” <span
id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md) And after a few words, by the same
prophet He says, “Not for your sakes do I do this, saith the Lord God;
it shall be known unto you: be ye confounded and blush for your ways, O
house of Israel. These things saith the Lord God: In the day in which I
shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, and shall ordain cities, and
the wilderness shall be built, and the desolated land shall be tilled,
whereas it was desolated before the eyes of every passer by. And they
shall say, This land that was desolated has become as a garden of
pleasure; and the wasted and desolated and ruined cities have settled
down fortified. And whatever nations have been left round about you
shall know that I the Lord have built the ruined places, I have planted
the desolated places: I the Lord have spoken, and have done it. Thus
saith the Lord: I will yet <span id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span
id="xviii.vi.xiv-Page_423"></span>for this inquire of the house of
Israel, that I may do it for them; I will multiply them men like sheep,
as holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in the days of her feast; so
shall be those desolated cities full of men as sheep: and they shall
know that I am the Lord.” <span id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md)
