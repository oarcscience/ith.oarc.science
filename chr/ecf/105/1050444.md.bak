id="xiv.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 59 \[XXXIV.\]—Although Pelagius Was
Acquitted, His Heresy Was Condemned.</span>

<span id="xiv.lxiii-p2"></span>Now, with respect to this treatise of
mine, which perhaps is not unreasonably lengthy, considering the
importance and extent of its subject, I have wished to inscribe it to
your Reverence, in order that, if it be not displeasing to your mind, it
may become known to such persons as I have thought may stand in need of
it under the recommendation of your authority, which carries so much
more weight than our own poor industry. Thus it may avail to crush the
vain and contentious thoughts of those persons who suppose that, because
Pelagius was acquited, those Eastern bishops who pronounced the judgment
approved of those dogmas which are beginning to shed very pernicious
influences against the Christian faith, and that grace of God whereby we
are called and justified. These the Christian verity never ceases to
condemn, as indeed it condemned them even by the authoritative sentence
of the fourteen bishops; nor would it, on the occasion in question, have
hesitated to condemn Pelagius too, unless he had anathematized the
heretical opinions with which he was charged. But now, while we render
to this man the respect of brotherly affection (and we have all along
expressed with all sincerity our anxiety for him and interest in him),
let us observe, with as much brevity as is consistent with accuracy of
observation, that, notwithstanding the undoubted fact of his having been
acquitted by a human verdict, the heresy itself has ever been held
worthy of condemnation by divine judgment, and has actually been
condemned by the sentence of these fourteen bishops of the Eastern
Church.
