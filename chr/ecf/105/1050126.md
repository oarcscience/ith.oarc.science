id="x.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XXIII.\]—The Corruption of
Nature is by Sin, Its Renovation is by Christ.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxxvii-p2"></span>From this law of sin is born the flesh
of sin, which requires cleansing through the sacrament of Him who came
in the likeness of sinful flesh, that the body of sin might be
destroyed, which is also called “the body of this death,” from which
only God’s grace delivers wretched man through Jesus Christ our
Lord. <span id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595) For this law, the origin
of death, passed on from the first pair to their posterity, as is seen
in the labour with which all men toil in the earth, and the travail of
women in the pains of childbirth. For these sufferings they merited by
the sentence of God, when they were convicted of sin; and we see them
fulfilled not only in them, but also in their descendants, in some more,
in others less, but nevertheless in all. Whereas, however, the primeval
righteousness of the first human beings consisted in obeying God, and
not having in their members the law of their own concupiscence against
the law of their mind; now, since their sin, in our sinful flesh which
is born of them, it is obtained by those who obey God, as a great
acquisition, that they do not obey the desires of this evil
concupiscence, but crucify in themselves the flesh with its affections
and lusts, in order that they may be Jesus Christ’s, who on His cross
symbolized this, and who gave them power through His grace to become the
sons of God. For it is not to all men, but to as many as have received
Him, that He has given to be born again to God of the Spirit, after they
were born to the world by the flesh. Of these indeed it is written: “But
as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of
God; which were born, not of the flesh, nor of blood, nor of the will of
man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.” <span
