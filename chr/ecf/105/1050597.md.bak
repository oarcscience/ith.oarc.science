<span id="xvi.v.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—When Good Will Be Perfectly
Done.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxii-p2"></span>The apostle then adds these words: “For
I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing: for to
will is present with me; but how to perfect that which is good I find
not.” <span id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167.md) Now this is said,
because a good thing is not then perfected, when there is an absence of
evil desires, as evil is perfected when evil desires are obeyed. But
when they are present, but are not obeyed, neither evil is performed,
since obedience is not yielded to them; nor good, because of their
inoperative presence. There is rather an intermediate condition of
things: good is effected in some degree, because the evil concupiscence
has gained no assent to itself; and in some degree there is a remnant of
evil, because the concupiscence is present. This accounts for the
apostle’s precise words. He does not say, To *do* good is not present to
him, but “how to perfect it.” For the truth is, one *does* a good deal
of good when he does what the Scripture enjoins, “Go not after thy
lusts;” <span id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168.md) yet he falls short of
perfection, in that he fails to keep the great commandment, “Thou shalt
not covet.” <span id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169.md) The law said,
“Thou shalt not covet,” in order that, when we find ourselves lying in
this diseased state, we might seek the medicine of Grace, and by that
commandment know both in what direction our endeavours should aim as we
advance in our present mortal condition, and to what a height it is
possible to reach in the future immortality. For unless perfection could
somewhere be attained, this commandment would never have been given to
us.
