<span id="xxi.iii.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—The Adversaries Cannot Deny
Predestination to Those Gifts of Grace Which They Themselves
Acknowledge, and Their Exhortations are Not Hindered by This
Predestination Nevertheless.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xliv-p2"></span>And what I said of chastity, can be
said also of faith, of piety, of love, of perseverance, and, not to
enumerate single virtues, it may be said with the utmost truthfulness of
all the obedience with which God is obeyed. But those who place only the
beginning of faith and perseverance to the end in such wise in our power
as not to regard them as God’s gifts, nor to think that God works on our
thoughts and wills so as that we may have and retain them, grant,
nevertheless, that He gives other things,—since they are obtained from
Him by the faith of the believer. Why are they not afraid that
exhortation to these other things, and the preaching of these other
things, should be hindered by the definition of predestination? Or,
perchance, do they say that such things are not predestinated? Then they
are not given by God, or He has not known that He would give them.
Because, if they are both given, and He foreknew that He would give
them, certainly He predestinated them. As, therefore, they themselves
also exhort to chastity, charity, piety, and other things which they
confess to be God’s gifts, and cannot deny that they are also foreknown
by Him, and <span id="page_543">p. 543</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.xliv-Page_543"></span>therefore predestinated; nor do they
say that their exhortations are hindered by the preaching of God’s
predestination, that is, by the preaching of God’s foreknowledge of
those future gifts of His: so they may see that neither are their
exhortations to faith or to perseverance hindered, even although those
very things may be said, as is the truth, to be gifts of God, and that
those things are foreknown, that is, predestinated to be given; but let
them rather see that by this preaching of predestination only that most
pernicious error is hindered and overthrown, whereby it is said that the
grace of God is given according to our deservings, so that he who
glories may glory not in the Lord, but in himself.
