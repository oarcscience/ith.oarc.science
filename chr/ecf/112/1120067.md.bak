<span id="v.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Homily XVIII.</span>

<span id="v.xviii-p2"></span><span id="v.xviii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.xviii-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor. viii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.xviii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xviii-p3"></span>*But thanks be to God, Which put* <span
id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) *the same earnest care for you into
the heart of Titus.*

<span id="v.xviii-p5"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.xviii-p5.1"></span>Again</span> he praises Titus. For since he had
discoursed of almsgiving, he afterwards discourseth also of those who
are to receive the money from them and carry it away. For this was of
aid <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) towards this collection, and
towards increasing the forwardness of the contributors. For he that
feels confidence as to him that ministereth <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) , and suspects not those who are to be
receivers, gives with the fuller bountifulness. And that this might be
the case then also, hear how he commends those that had come for this
purpose, the first of whom was Titus. Wherefore also he saith, “But
thanks be to God, Which put (literally, ‘gave’) the same earnest care
into the heart of Titus.” What is “the same?” Which he had also in
respect to the Thessalonians, or “the same” with me. And mark here
wisdom. Showing this to be the work of God, he also gives thanks to Him
that gave, so as to incite by this also. ‘For if God stirred him up and
sent him to you, He asks through Him. Think not therefore that what has
happened is of men.’ And whence is it manifest that God incited him?

<span id="v.xviii-p8"></span>[2 Cor.
8.17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#017.md)<span id="v.xviii-p8.1"></span>.
“For indeed he accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest,
he went forth of his own accord.”

<span id="v.xviii-p9"></span>Observe how he also represents him as
fulfilling his own part, and needing no prompting from others. And
having mentioned the grace of God, he doth not leave the whole to be
God’s; again, that by this also he may win them unto greater love,
having said that he was stirred up from himself <span
id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) also. For, “being very earnest, he
went forth of his own accord,” ‘he seized at the thing, he rushed upon
the treasure, he considered your service to be his own advantage; and
because he loved you exceedingly, he needed not the exhortation I gave;
but though he was exhorted by me also, yet it was not by that he was
stirred up; but from himself and by the grace of God.’

<span id="v.xviii-p11"></span>[2 Cor.
8.18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018.md)<span id="v.xviii-p11.1"></span>.
“And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the
Gospel is spread through all the Churches.”

<span id="v.xviii-p12"></span>And who is this brother? Some indeed say,
Luke, because of the history which he wrote, but some, Barnabas; for he
calls the unwritten preaching also Gospel. And for what cause does he
not mention their names; whilst he both makes Titus known (vid. also [2
Cor. 8.23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023.md)<span
id="v.xviii-p12.1"></span>.) by name, and praises him for his
cooperation in the Gospel, (seeing that he was so useful that by reason
of his absence even Paul could do nothing great and noble; for, “because
I found not Titus my brother, I had no relief for my spirit,”—c. [2 Cor.
2.13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013)<span id="v.xviii-p12.2"></span>..md)
and for his love towards them, (for, saith he, “his inward affection is
more abundant towards you;”—c. [2 Cor.
7.15](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#015)<span id="v.xviii-p12.3"></span>..md)
and for his zeal in this matter (“for,” he saith, “of his own accord he
went”)? But these he neither equally commends, nor mentions by name?
What then is one to say? Perhaps <span id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span
id="v.xviii-Page_364"></span>they did not know them; wherefore he does
not dwell upon their praises because as yet they had had no experience
of them, but only says so much as was sufficient for their commendation
unto them (i.e. the Corinthians,) and to their escaping all evil
suspicion. However, let us see on what score he eulogizes this man
himself also. On what score then does he eulogize? First, praising him
from his preaching; that he not only preached, but also as he ought, and
with the befitting earnestness. For he said not, ‘he preaches and
proclaims the Gospel,’ but, “whose praise is in the Gospel.” And that he
may not seem to flatter him, he brings not one or two or three men, but
whole Churches to testify to him, saying, “through all the churches.”
Then he makes him respected also from the judgment of those that had
chosen him. And this too is no light matter. Therefore after saying,
“Whose praise in the Gospel is spread through all the churches,” he
added,

<span id="v.xviii-p13"></span>[2 Cor.
8.19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019.md)<span id="v.xviii-p13.1"></span>.
“And not only so.”

<span id="v.xviii-p14"></span>What is, “and not only so?” ‘Not only on
this account,’ he says, ‘is respect due to him, that he is approved as a
preacher and is praised by all.’

<span id="v.xviii-p15"></span>“But he was also appointed by the churches
along with us.”

<span id="v.xviii-p16"></span>Whence it seems to me, that Barnabas is
the person intimated. And he signifies his dignity to be great, for he
shows also for what office he was appointed. For he saith,

<span id="v.xviii-p17"></span>“To travel with us in the matter of this
grace which is ministered by us.” Seest thou how great are these praises
of him? He shone as a preacher of the Gospel and had all the churches
testifying to this. He was chosen by us; and unto the same office with
Paul, and everywhere was partner with him, both in his trials and in his
dangers, for this is implied in the word “travel.” But what is, “with
this grace which is ministered by us?” So as to proclaim the word, he
means, and to preach the Gospel; or to minister also in respect of the
money; yea rather, he seems to me to refer to both of these. Then he
adds,

<span id="v.xviii-p18"></span>“To the glory of the same Lord, and to
show your readiness <span id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) .” What he
means is this: ‘We thought good,’ he says, ‘that he should be chosen
with us and be appointed unto this work, so as to become a dispenser and
a minister of the sacred money.’ Nor was this a little matter. For,
“Look ye out,” it saith, “from among you seven men of good report;”
([Acts vi. 3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.xviii-p19.1"></span>.) and he was chosen by the churches, and
there was a vote of the whole people taken. What is, “to the glory of
the same Lord, and your readiness?” ‘That both God may be glorified and
ye may become the readier, they who are to receive this money being of
proved character, and no one <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md)
able to engender any false suspicion against them. Therefore we sought
out such persons, and entrusted not the whole to one person only, that
he might escape this suspicion also; but we sent both Titus and another
with him. Then to interpret this same expression, “to the glory of the
Lord and your ready mind:” he added,

<span id="v.xviii-p21"></span>[2 Cor.
8.20](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#020.md)<span id="v.xviii-p21.1"></span>.
“Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this
bounty which is ministered by us.”

<span id="v.xviii-p22"></span>What can this be which is said? A thing
worthy of the virtue of Paul; and showing the greatness of his tender
care and his condescension. ‘For,’ he says, ‘that none should suspect
us, nor have the slightest cavil against us, as though we purloined
aught of the money placed in our hands; therefore we send such persons,
and not one only, but even two or three.’ Seest thou how he clears them
of all suspicions? Not on account of the Gospel, nor of their having
been chosen merely; but also, from their being persons of proved
character, (and for this very reason) having been chosen, that they
might not be suspected. And he said not ‘that ye should not blame,’ but
‘that no other person should.’ And yet it was on their account that he
did this; and he implied as much in saying, “to the glory of the same
Lord, and your readiness:” however, he does not wish to wound them; and
so expresses himself differently,

<span id="v.xviii-p23"></span>“Avoiding this.” And he is not satisfied
with this either, but by what he adds, soothes again, saying,

<span id="v.xviii-p24"></span>“In the matter of this bounty which is
ministered by us,” and mingling his severity with praise. For that they
might not feel hurt, and say, ‘Is he obliged then to eye us stealthily,
and are we so miserable as ever to have been suspected of these things?’
Providing a correction against this too, he says, ‘the money sent by you
is of large amount, and this abundance, that is, the large amount of the
money, is enough to afford suspicion to the evil-minded had we not
offered that security <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) .’

<span id="v.xviii-p26"></span>[2 Cor.
8.21](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#021.md)<span id="v.xviii-p26.1"></span>.
For “we take thought for things, honorable not only in the sight of the
Lord, but also in the sight of men.”

<span id="v.xviii-p27"></span>What can compare with Paul? For he said
not, ‘Perdition and woe to him who chooses to suspect anything of the
kind: so long as my conscience does not condemn me, I waste not a <span
id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span id="v.xviii-Page_365"></span>thought
on those who suspect.’ Rather, the weaker they were, the more he
condescended. For it is meet not to be angry with, but help, him that is
sick. And yet from what sin are we so removed as he was from any such
suspicion? For not even a demon could have suspected that blessed saint
of this unfaithfulness. But still although so far removed from that evil
suspicion, he does everything and resorts to every expedient <span
id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) , so as not to leave a shadow even to
those who might be desirous in any way <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) of suspecting something wrong; and he
avoids not only accusations, but also blame and the slightest censure,
even bare suspicion.

<span id="v.xviii-p30"></span>\[2.\] [2 Cor.
8.22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022.md)<span id="v.xviii-p30.1"></span>.
“And we have sent with them our brother.”

<span id="v.xviii-p31"></span>Behold, again he adds yet another, and him
also with an encomium; both his own judgment, and many other witnesses
\[to him\].

<span id="v.xviii-p32"></span>“Whom,” saith he, “we have many times
proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest.” And having
praised him from his own good works, he extols him also from his love
towards them; and what he said of Titus, that “being very earnest he
went forth of his own accord;” this he says of this person also, saying,
“but now much more earnest;” laying up beforehand for them the seeds of
\[the proof of their\] love toward the Corinthians.

<span id="v.xviii-p33"></span>And then, after having showed forth their
virtue, he exhorts them also on their behalf, saying,

<span id="v.xviii-p34"></span>[2 Cor.
8.23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023.md)<span id="v.xviii-p34.1"></span>.
“Whether any inquire about Titus; he is my partner and my fellow-worker
to youward.”

<span id="v.xviii-p35"></span>What is, “Whether about Titus?” ‘If,’ says
he, ‘it be necessary to say any thing, this I have to say,’ “that he is
my partner and fellow-worker to youward.” For he either means this; or,
‘if ye will do anything for Titus, ye will do it unto no ordinary
person, for he is “my partner.”’ And whilst appearing to be praising
him, he magnifies them, showing them to be so disposed towards himself
as that it were sufficient ground of honor amongst them that any one
should appear to be his “partner.” But, nevertheless, he was not content
with this, but he also added another thing, saying, “fellow-worker to
youward.” Not merely “fellow-worker,” ‘but in matters concerning you, in
your progress, in your growth, in our friendship, in our zeal for you;’
which last would avail most especially to endear <span
id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) him unto them.

<span id="v.xviii-p37"></span>“Or our brethren:” ‘or whether you wish,’
he says, ‘to hear any thing about the others: they too have great claims
to be commended to you. For they also,’ he saith, ‘are our brethren,
and,

<span id="v.xviii-p38"></span>“The messengers of the Churches,”’ that
is, sent by the Churches. Then, which is greater than all,

<span id="v.xviii-p39"></span>“The glory of Christ;” for to Him is
referred whatever shall be done to them. ‘Whether then ye wish to
receive them as brethren, or as Apostles of the Churches, or as acting
for the glory of Christ; ye have many motives for good will towards
them. For on behalf of Titus, I have to say, that he is both “my
partner,” and a lover of you; on behalf of these, that they are
“brethren,” that they are “the messengers of the churches,” that they
are “the glory of Christ.” Seest thou that it is plain from hence also,
that they were of such as were unknown to them?  For otherwise he would
have set them off by those things with which he had also set off Titus,
namely, his love towards them. But whereas as yet they were not known to
them, ‘Receive them,’ he says, ‘as brethren, as messengers of the
churches, as acting for the glory of Christ.’ On which account he adds;

<span id="v.xviii-p40"></span>[2 Cor.
8.24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#024.md)<span id="v.xviii-p40.1"></span>.
“Wherefore show ye unto them, to the person <span
id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) of the churches, the proof of your
love, and of our glorying on your behalf.”

<span id="v.xviii-p42"></span>‘Now show,’ he saith, ‘how ye love us; and
how we do not lightly nor vainly boast in you: and this ye will show, if
ye show forth love towards them.’ Then he also makes his words more
solemn, by saying, “unto the person of the churches.” He means, to the
glory, the honor, of the churches. ‘For if ye honor them, ye have
honored the churches that sent them. For the honor passeth not to them
alone, but also to those that sent them forth, who ordained them, and
more than these, unto the glory of God.’ For when we honor those that
minister to Him, the kind reception <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) passeth unto Him, unto the common body
of the churches. Now this too is no light thing, for great is the
potency of that assembly.

<span id="v.xviii-p44"></span>\[3.\] Certain it is at least that the
prayer of the churches loosed Peter from his chains, opened the mouth of
Paul; their voice in no slight degree equips those that arrive unto
spiritual rule. Therefore indeed it is that both he who is going to
ordain calleth at that time for their prayers also, and that they add
their votes and assent by acclamations which the initiated know: for it
is not lawful before the uninitiated to unbare all things. But there are
occasions in which there is no difference at all between the priest and
those under him; for instance, when we are <span id="page_366">p.
366</span> <span id="v.xviii-Page_366"></span>to partake <span
id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) of the awful mysteries; for we are all
alike counted worthy of the same things: not as under the Old Testament
\[when\] the priest ate some things and those under him others, and it
was not lawful for the people to partake of those things whereof the
priest partook. But not so now, but before all one body is set and one
cup. And in the prayers also, one may observe the people contributing
much. For in behalf of the possessed, in behalf of those under penance,
the prayers are made in common both by the priest and by them; and all
say one prayer, the prayer replete with pity. Again when we exclude from
the holy precincts those who are unable to partake of the holy table, it
behoveth that another prayer be offered, and we all alike fall upon the
ground, and all alike rise up. Again, in the most awful mysteries
themselves, the priest prays for the people and the people also pray for
the priest; for the words, “with thy spirit,” are nothing else than
this. The offering of thanksgiving again is common: for neither doth he
give thanks alone, but also all the people. For having first taken their
voices, next when they assent that it is “meet and right so to do,” then
he begins the thanksgiving. And why marvellest thou that the people any
where utter aught with the priest, when indeed even with the very
Cherubim, and the powers above, they send up in common those sacred
hymns? Now I have said all this in order that each one of the laity also
may be wary <span id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) , that we may
understand that we are all one body, having such difference amongst
ourselves as members with members; and may not throw the whole upon the
priests but ourselves also so care for the whole Church as for a body
common to us. For this course will provide for our <span
id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md) greater safety, and for your greater
growth unto virtue. Here, at least, in the case of the Apostles, how
frequently they admitted the laity to share in their decisions. For when
they ordained the seven, ([Acts 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003)<span id="v.xviii-p47.1"></span>..md)
they first communicated with the people; and when Peter ordained
Matthias, with all that were then present, both men and women. ([Acts i.
15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md)<span id="v.xviii-p47.2"></span>,
&c.) For here <span id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) is no pride of
rulers nor slavishness in the ruled; but a spiritual rule, in this
particular usurping <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md) most, in
taking on itself the greater share of the labor and of the care which is
on your behalf, not in seeking larger honors. For so ought the Church to
dwell as one house; as one body so to be all disposed; just as therefore
there is both one Baptism, and one table, and one fountain, and one
creation, and one Father. Why then are we divided, when so great <span
id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) things unite us; why are we torn
asunder? For we are compelled again to bewail the same things, which I
have lamented often. The state in which we are calls for lamentation; so
widely are we severed from each other, when we ought to image the
conjunction <span id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) of one body. For in
this way will he that is greater, be able to gain even from him that is
less. For if Moses learnt from his father-in-law somewhat expedient
which himself had not perceived, ([Exod. xviii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#014.md)<span id="v.xviii-p51.2"></span>,
&c.) much more in the Church may this happen. And how then came it that
what he that was an unbeliever perceived, he that was spiritual
perceived not? That all those of that time might understand that he was
a man; and though he divide the sea, though he cleave the rock, he
needeth the influence of God, and that those acts were not of man’s
nature, but of God’s power. And so let another rise up and speak; and so
now, if such and such an one doth not say expedient things, let another
rise up and speak; though he be an inferior, yet if he say somewhat to
the purpose <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) , confirm his
opinion; and even if he be of the very meanest, do not show him
disrespect. For no one of these is at so great a distance from his
neighbor, as Moses’ father-in-law was from him, yet he disdained not to
listen to him, but even admitted his opinion, and was persuaded, and
recorded it; and was not ashamed to hand down the circumstances to
history; casting down \[so\] the pride of the many. Wherefore also he
left this story to the world <span id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847.md)
engraven as it were on a pillar, for he knew that it would be useful to
many. Let us then not overlook those who give us behoveful counsel, even
though they be of the meaner sort, nor insist that those counsels
prevail which we have ourselves introduced; but whatever shall appear to
be best, let that be approved by all. For many of duller sight have
perceived things sooner than those of acute vision, by means of
diligence and attention. And say not, “why dost thou call me to council,
if thou hearkenest not to what I say?” These accusations are not a
counsellor’s, but a despot’s. For the counsellor hath only power to
speak his own opinion; but if something else appear more profitable, and
yet he will carry his own opinion into effect, he is no longer a
counsellor but a despot, as I said. Let us not, then, act in this
manner; but having freed our souls from all arrogancy and pride, let us
consider, not how our counsels only may stand, but how that opinion
which is best may prevail, even though it may not have been <span
id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span id="v.xviii-Page_367"></span>brought
forward by us. For no light gain will be ours, even though we should not
have discovered what behoveth, if ourselves accepted what has been
pointed out by others; and abundant is the reward we shall receive from
God, and so too shall we best attain to glory. For as he is wise that
speaketh that which is behoveful, so shall we that have accepted it,
ourselves also reap the praise of prudence and of candor. Thus if both
houses and states, thus too if the Church be ordered, she will receive a
larger increase <span id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md) ; and so too
shall we ourselves, having thus best ordered our present lives, receive
the good things to come: whereunto may we all attain, through the grace
and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory for ever
and ever. Amen.
