<span id="iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Homily XIV.</span>

<span id="iv.xv-p2"></span><span id="iv.xv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xv-p2.2"></span>[1 Cor. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.xv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xv-p3"></span>*For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy,
who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in
remembrance of my ways which be in Christ Jesus.* <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md)

<span id="iv.xv-p5"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iv.xv-p5.1"></span>Consider</span> here also, I entreat, the noble
soul, the soul more glowing and keener than fire: how he was indeed
especially desirous to be present himself with the Corinthians, thus
distempered and broken into parties. For he knew well what a help to the
disciples his presence was and what a mischief his absence. And the
former he declared in the Epistle to the Philippians, saying, ([Philipp.
2.12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.xv-p5.2"></span>.
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p5.3"></span> καὶ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p5.4"></span>\[\]</span> om. in rec.
text.) “Not as in my presence only, but also now much more in my
absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” The
latter he signifies in this Epistle, saying, ([1 Cor.
4.18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.xv-p5.5"></span><span
id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span id="iv.xv-Page_78"></span>.) “Now some
are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you; but I will come.” He
was urgent, it seems, and desirous to be present himself. But as this
was not possible for a time, he corrects them by the promise of his
appearance; and not this only, but also by the sending of his disciple.
“For this,” he saith, “I have sent unto you Timothy.” “For this cause:”
how is that? “Because I care for you as for children, and as having
begotten you.” And the message is accompanied with a recommendation of
his person:  “Who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord.” Now
this he said, both to shew his love of him, and to prepare them to look
on him with respect. And not simply “faithful,” but, “in the Lord;” that
is, in the things pertaining to the Lord.  Now if in worldly things it
is high praise for a man to be faithful, much more in things spiritual.

<span id="iv.xv-p6"></span>If then he was his “beloved child,” consider
how great was Paul’s love, in choosing to be separated from him for the
Corinthian’s sake, And if “faithful” also, he will be unexceptionable in
his ministering to their affairs.

<span id="iv.xv-p7"></span>“Who shall put you in remembrance.” He said
not, “shall teach,” lest they should take it ill, as being used to learn
from himself. Wherefore also towards the end he saith, ([1 Cor.
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011)<span id="iv.xv-p7.1"></span>..md)
“For he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. Let no man therefore
despise him.” For there was no envy among the Apostles, but they had an
eye unto one thing, the edification of the Church. And if he that was
employed was their inferior, they did as it were support (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p7.2"></span>συνεκρότουν</span>) him with
all earnestness. Wherefore neither was he contented with saying, “He
shall put you in remembrance;” but purposing to cut out their envy more
completely,—for Timothy was young,—with this view, I say, he adds, “my
ways;” not “his,” but “mine;” that is, his methods, (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p7.3"></span>τὰς</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p7.4"></span>οἰκονομίας</span>.) his
dangers, his customs, his laws, his ordinances, his Apostolical Canons,
and all the rest. For since he had said, “We are naked, and are
buffered, and have no certain dwelling place: all these things,” saith
he, “he will remind you of;” and also of the laws of Christ; for
destroying all heresies. Then, carrying his argument higher, he adds,
“which be in Christ;” ascribing all, as was his wont, unto the Lord, and
on that ground establishing the credibility of what is to follow.
Wherefore he subjoins, “Even as I teach every where in every church.”
“Nothing new have I spoken unto you: of these my proceedings all the
other Churches are cognizant as well as you.” Further: he calls them
“ways in Christ,” to shew that they have in them nothing human, and that
with the aid from that source he doth all things well.

<span id="iv.xv-p8"></span>\[2.\] And having said these things and so
soothed them, and being just about to enter on his charge against the
unclean person, he again utters words full of anger; not that in himself
he felt so but in order to correct them: and giving over the fornicator,
he directs his discourse to the rest, as not deeming him worthy even of
words from himself; just as we act in regard to our servants when they
have given us great offence.

<span id="iv.xv-p9"></span>Next, after that he had said, “I send
Timothy, lest they should thereupon take things too easily, mark what he
saith:

<span id="iv.xv-p10"></span>[1 Cor.
4.18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.xv-p10.1"></span>.
“Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming unto you.” For
there he glances both at them and at certain others, casting down their
highmindedness: since the love of preeminence is in fault, when men
abuse the absence of their teacher for their own self-will. For when he
addresses himself unto the people, observe how he does it by way of
appeal to their sense of shame; when unto the originators of the
mischief, his manner is more vehement. Thus unto the former he saith,
“We are the offscouring of all:” and soothing them he saith, “Not to
shame you I write these things;” but to the latter, “Now as though I
were not coming to you, some are puffed up;” shewing that their
self-will argued a childish turn of mind. For so boys in the absence of
their master wax more negligent.

<span id="iv.xv-p11"></span>This then is one thing here indicated; and
another is that his presence was sufficient for their correction. For as
the presence of a lion makes all living creatures shrink away, so also
does that of Paul the corrupters of the Church.

<span id="iv.xv-p12"></span>[1 Cor.
4.19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.xv-p12.1"></span>.
And therefore he goes on, “But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord
will.” Now to say this only would seem to be mere threatening. But to
promise himself and demand from them the requisite proof by actions
also; this was a course for a truly high spirit. Accordingly he added
this too, saying,

<span id="iv.xv-p13"></span>“And I will know, not the word of them which
are puffed up, but the power.” For not from any excellencies of their
own but from their teacher’s absence, this self-will arose. Which again
itself was a mark of a scornful mind towards him. And this is why,
having said, “I have sent Timothy,” he did not at once add, “I will
come;” but waited until he had brought his charge against them of being
“puffed up:” after that he saith, “I will come.” Since, had he put it
before the charge, it would rather have been an apology for himself as
not having been deficient, instead of a threat; nor even so (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p13.1"></span>οὕτως</span> so the King’s
<span class="c18"><span id="iv.xv-p13.2"></span>ms</span>. <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p13.3"></span> οὖτος</span> the rec.
text.) would the statement have been convincing. <span id="page_79">p.
79</span> <span id="iv.xv-Page_79"></span>But as it is, placing it after
the accusation, he rendered himself such as they would both believe and
fear.

<span id="iv.xv-p14"></span>Mark also how solid and secure he makes his
ground: for he saith not simply, “I will come:” but, “If the Lord will:”
and he appoints no set time. For since he might perhaps be tardy in
coming, by that uncertainty he would fain keep them anxiously engaged.
And, lest they should hereupon fall back again, he added, “shortly,”

<span id="iv.xv-p15"></span>\[3.\] “And I will know, not the word of
them that are puffed up, but the power.” He said not, “I will know not
the wisdom, nor the signs,” but what? “not the word:” by the term he
employs at the same time depressing the one and exalting the other. And
for a while he is setting himself against the generality of them who
were countenancing the fornicator. For if he were speaking of him, he
would not say, “the power;” but, “the works,” the corrupt works which he
did.

<span id="iv.xv-p16"></span>Now why seekest thou not after “the word?”
“Not because I am wanting in word but because all our doings are ‘in
power.’” As therefore in war success is not for those who talk much but
those who effect much; so also in this case, not speakers, but doers
have the victory. “Thou,” saith he, “art proud of this fine speaking.
Well, if it were a contest and a time for orators, thou mightest
reasonably be elated thereat: but if of Apostles preaching truth, and by
signs confirming the same, why art thou puffed up for a thing
superfluous and unreal, and to the present purpose utterly inefficient?
For what could a display of words avail towards raising the dead, or
expelling evil spirits, or working any other such deed of wonder?  But
these are what we want now, and by these our cause stands.” Whereupon
also he adds,

<span id="iv.xv-p17"></span>[1 Cor.
4.20](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.xv-p17.1"></span>.
“For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.” By signs, saith
he, not by fine speaking, we have prevailed: and that our teaching is
divine and really announces the Kingdom of Heaven we give the greater
proof, namely, our signs which we work by the power of the Spirit. If
those who are now puffed up desire to be some great ones; as soon as I
am come, let them shew whether they have any such power. And let me not
find them sheltering themselves behind a pomp of words: for that kind of
art is nothing to us.

<span id="iv.xv-p18"></span>\[4.\] [1 Cor.
4.21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.xv-p18.1"></span>.
“What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit
of meekness?”

<span id="iv.xv-p19"></span>There is much both of terror and of
gentleness in this saying. For to say, “I will know,” was the language
of one as yet withholding himself: but to say, “What will ye?  Must I
come unto you with a rod?” are the words of one thenceforth ascending
the teacher’s seat, and from thence holding discourses with them and
taking upon him all his authority.

<span id="iv.xv-p20"></span>What means, “with a rod?” With punishment,
with vengeance: that is, I will destroy; I will strike with blindness:
the kind of thing which Peter did in the case of Sapphira, and himself
in the case of Elymas the sorcerer. For henceforth he no longer speaks
as bringing himself into a close comparison with the other teachers, but
with authority. And in the second Epistle too he appears to say the
same, when he writes, “Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me.”

<span id="iv.xv-p21"></span>“Shall I come with a rod, or in love?” What
then? to come with a rod, was it not an instance of love? Of love it was
surely <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) . But because through his
great love he shrinks back in punishing, therefore he so expresses
himself.

<span id="iv.xv-p23"></span>Further; when he spoke about punishment, he
said not, “in a spirit of meekness,” but, \[simply,\] “with a rod:” and
yet of that too the Spirit was author. For there is a spirit of
meekness, and a spirit of severity. He doth not, however, choose so to
call it, but from its milder aspect (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xv-p23.1"></span>ἀπὸ τῶν</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xv-p23.2"></span>χρηστοτέρων</span>.) And for a like reason also,
God, although avenging Himself, has it often affirmed of Him that He is
“gracious and long-suffering, and rich in mercy and pity:” but that He
is apt to punish, once perhaps or twice, and sparingly, and that upon
some urgent cause.

<span id="iv.xv-p24"></span>\[5.\] Consider then the wisdom of Paul;
holding the authority in his own hands, he leaves both his and that in
the power of others, saying, “What will ye?” “The matter is at your
disposal.”

<span id="iv.xv-p25"></span>For we too have depending on us both sides
of the alternative; both falling into hell, and obtaining the kingdom: 
since God hath so willed it. For, “behold,” saith he, “fire and water:
whichever way thou wilt, thou mayest stretch forth thine hand”
([Ecclesiasticus 15.16](../../../bib/apo/sir015.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.xv-p25.1"></span>.) And, “If ye be willing, and will hearken unto
me, ye shall eat the good of the land; ([Is. i.
19](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019)<span id="iv.xv-p25.2"></span>,.md) but
if ye be not willing, the sword shall devour you.”

<span id="iv.xv-p26"></span>But perhaps one will say, “I am willing;
(and no one is so void of understanding as not to be willing;) but to
will is not sufficient for me.” Nay, but it is sufficient, if thou be
duly willing, and do the deeds of one that is willing. But as it is,
thou art not greatly willing.

<span id="iv.xv-p27"></span>And let us try this in other things, if it
seem good. For tell me, he that would marry a wife, is he content with
wishing? By no means; but <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span
id="iv.xv-Page_80"></span>he looks out for women to advance his suit,
and request friends to keep watch with him, and gets together money.
Again, the merchant is not content with sitting at home and wishing, but
he first hires a vessel, then selects sailors and rowers, then takes up
money on interest, and is inquisitive about a market and the price of
merchandise. Is it not then strange for men to shew themselves so much
in earnest about earthly things, but that when they are to make a
venture for heaven, they should be content with wishing only? rather I
should say, not even in this do they shew themselves properly in
earnest. For he that wills a thing as he ought, puts also his hand unto
the means which lead to the object of his desire. Thus, when hunger
compels thee to take nourishment, thou waitest not for the viands to
come unto thee of their own accord, but omittest nothing to gather
victuals together. So in thirst, and cold and all other such things,
thou art industrious and duly prepared to take care of the body. Now do
this in respect of God’s kingdom also, and surely thou shalt obtain it.

<span id="iv.xv-p28"></span>For to this end God made thee a free agent,
that thou mightest not afterwards accuse God, as though some necessity
had bound thee: but thou, in regard of those very things wherein thou
hast been honored, dost murmur.

<span id="iv.xv-p29"></span>For in fact I have often heard people say,
“But why did He then make my goodness depend on me?” Nay, but how was He
to bring thee, slumbering and sleeping, and in love with all iniquity,
and living delicately, and pampering thyself; how was He to bring thee
up to heaven? If He had, thou wouldest not have abstained from vice. For
if now, even in the face of threatening, thou dost not turn aside from
thy wickedness; had he added no less than heaven as the end of thy race,
when wouldest thou have ceased waxing more careless and worse by far?
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p29.1"></span>χείρων πολλῷ.
πολλῶν</span> Bened.)

<span id="iv.xv-p30"></span>Neither again wilt thou be able to allege,
He hath shewed me indeed what things were good but gave no help, for
abundant also is His promise to thee of aid.

<span id="iv.xv-p31"></span>\[6.\] “But,” say you, “Virtue is burdensome
and distasteful; while with vice great pleasure is blended; and the one
is wide and broad, but the other strait and narrow.”

<span id="iv.xv-p32"></span>Tell me then, are they respectively such
throughout, or only from the beginning? For in fact what thou here
sayest, thou sayest, not intending it, in behalf of virtue; so potent a
thing is truth. For suppose there were two roads, the one leading to a
furnace, and the other to a Paradise; and that the one unto the furnace
were broad, the other unto Paradise, narrow; which road wouldest thou
take in preference? For although you may now gainsay for contradiction’s
sake, yet things which are plainly allowed on all hands, however
shameless, you will not be able to gainsay. Now that that way is rather
to be chosen which hath its beginning difficult but not its end, I will
endeavor to teach you from what is quite obvious. And, if you please,
let us first take in hand the arts. For these have their beginning full
of toil, but the end gainful. “But,” say you, “no one applies himself to
an art without some one to compel him; for,” you add, “so long as the
boy is his own master, he will choose rather to take his ease at first,
and in the end to endure the evil, how great soever, than to live hardly
at the outset, and afterwards reap the fruit of those labors.” Well
then, to make such a choice comes of a mind left to itself, (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p32.1"></span>ὀρφανικῆς</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p32.2"></span>διανοίας</span>) and of
childish idleness: but the contrary choice, of sense and manliness. And
so it is with us: were we not children in mind, we should not be like
the child aforesaid, forsaken (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xv-p32.3"></span>ὀρφάνῳ</span>) as he is and thoughtless, but
like him that hath a father. We must cast out then our own childish
mind, and not find fault with the things themselves; and we must set a
charioteer over our conscience, who will not allow us to indulge our
appetite, but make us run and strive mightily. For what else but
absurdity is it to inure our children with pains at first unto pursuits
which have laborious beginnings, but their end good and pleasant; while
we ourselves in spiritual things take just the contrary turn?

<span id="iv.xv-p33"></span>And yet even in those earthly things it is
not quite plain that the end will be good and pleasant: since before now
untimely death, or poverty, or false accusation, or reverse of fortune,
or other such things, of which there are many, have caused men after
their long toil to be deprived of all its fruits. What is more, those
who have such pursuits, though they succeed, it is no great gain which
they will reap. For with the present life all those things are
dissolved. But here, not for such fruitless and perishable things is our
race, neither have we fears about the end; but greater and more secure
is our hope after our departure hence. What pardon then can there be,
what excuse for those who will not strip themselves for the evils to be
endured for virtue’s sake?

<span id="iv.xv-p34"></span>And do they yet ask, “Wherefore is the way
narrow?” Why, thou dost not deem it right that any fornicator or lewd or
drunken (<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p34.1"></span>και
τῶν</span> <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p34.2"></span>
μεθυόντων</span> inserted from the King’s <span class="c18"><span
id="iv.xv-p34.3"></span>ms.</span>) person should enter into the courts
of earthly kings; and claimest thou for men to be let into heaven itself
with licentiousness, and luxury, and drunkenness, and covetousness, and
all manner of iniquity? And how can these things be pardonable?

<span id="iv.xv-p35"></span><span id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span
id="iv.xv-Page_81"></span>\[7.\]  “Nay,” you reply, “I say not that, but
why has not virtue a “broad way?” In good truth if we be willing, its
way is very easy. For whether is easier, tell me; to dig through a wall
and take other men’s goods and so be cast into prison; or to be content
with what you have and freed from all fear? I have not however said all.
For whether is easier, tell me; to steal all men’s goods and revel in
few of them for a short time, and then to be racked and scourged
eternally; or having lived in righteous poverty for a short time, to
live ever after in delights? (For let us not enquire as yet which is the
more profitable, but for the present, which is the more easy.) Whether
again is it pleasanter, to see a good dream and to be punished in
reality; or after having had a disagreeable dream to be really in
enjoyment? Of course the latter. Tell me then, In what sense dost thou
call virtue harsh? I grant, it is harsh, tried by comparison with our
carelessness. However, that it is really easy and smooth, hear what
Christ saith, (St. [Matt. xi. 30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.xv-p35.1"></span>.) “My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.”
But if thou perceivest not the lightness, plainly it is for want of
courageous zeal; since where that is, even heavy things are light; and
by the same rule where it is not, even light things are heavy. For tell
me, what could be sweeter and more easily obtained than the banquet of
manna? Yet the Jews were discontented, though enjoying such delightful
fare. What more bitter than hunger and all the other hardships which
Paul endured? Yet he leaped up, and rejoiced, and said, ([Col. i.
24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024)<span id="iv.xv-p35.2"></span>..md)
“Now I rejoice in my sufferings.” What then is the cause? The difference
of the mind. If then you frame this as it ought to be, you will see the
easiness of virtue.

<span id="iv.xv-p36"></span>“What then,” say you, “does she only become
such through the mind of those who pursue her?” She is such, not from
their mind alone, but by nature as well. Which I thus prove: If the one
had been throughout a thing painful, the other throughout of the
contrary sort, then with some plausibility might some fallen persons
have said that the latter was easier than the former. But if they have
their beginnings, the one in hardship, the other in pleasure, but their
respective ends again just opposite to these; and if those ends be both
infinite, in the one the pleasure, in the other the burthen; tell me,
which is the more easy to choose?

<span id="iv.xv-p37"></span>“Why then do many not choose that which is
easy?” Because some disbelieve; and others, who believe, have their
judgment corrupt, and would prefer pleasure for a season to that which
is everlasting. “Is not this then easy?” Not so: but this cometh of a
sick soul. And as the reason why persons in a fever long after cool
drink is not upon calculation that the momentary luxury is pleasanter
than being burned up from beginning to end, but because they cannot
restrain their inordinate desire; so also these. Since if one brought
them to their punishment at the very moment of their pleasure, assuredly
they never would have chosen it. Thus you see in what sense vice is not
an easy thing.

<span id="iv.xv-p38"></span>\[8.\] But if you will, let us try this same
point over again by an example in the proper subject matter. Tell me,
for instance, which is pleasanter and easier? (only let us not take
again the desire of the many for our rule in the matter; since one ought
to decide, not by the sick, but by the whole; just as you might show me
ten thousand men in a fever, seeking things unwholesome upon choice to
suffer for it afterwards; but I should not allow such choice;) which, I
repeat, brings more ease, tell me; to desire much wealth, or to be above
that desire? For I, for my part, think the latter. If thou disbelieve
it, let the argument be brought to the facts themselves.

<span id="iv.xv-p39"></span>Let us then suppose one man desiring much,
another nothing. Which now is the better state, tell me, and which the
more respectable? However, let that pass. For this is agreed upon, that
the latter is a finer character than the former. And we are making no
enquiry about this at present, but which lives the easier and pleasanter
life? Well then: the lover of money will not enjoy even what he has: for
that which he loves he cannot choose to spend; but would gladly even
carve (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xv-p39.1"></span>κατακόψειε</span>) himself out, and part with
his flesh rather than with his gold. But he that despises wealth, gains
this the while, that he enjoys what he has quietly and with great
security, and that he values himself more than it. Which then is the
pleasanter; to enjoy what one has with freedom, or to live under a
master, namely wealth, and not dare to touch a single thing even of
one’s own? Why, it seemeth to me to be much the same as if any two men,
having wives and loving them exceedingly, were not upon the same terms
with them; but the one were allowed the presence and intercourse of his
wife, the other not even permitted to come near his.

<span id="iv.xv-p40"></span>There is another thing which I wish to
mention, indicating the pleasure of the one and the discomfort of the
other. He that is greedy of gain will never be stayed in that desire,
not only because it is impossible, for him to obtain all men’s goods,
but also because whatever he may have compassed, he counts himself to
have nothing. But the despiser of riches will deem it all superfluous,
and will not have to punish his soul with endless desires. I say,
punish; for nothing so completely answers <span id="page_82">p.
82</span> <span id="iv.xv-Page_82"></span>the definition of punishment
as desire deprived of gratification; a thing too which especially marks
his perverse mind. Look at it in this way. He that lusts after riches
and hath increased his store, he is the sort of person to feel as if he
had nothing. I ask then, what more complicated than this disease? And
the strange thing is not this only, but that although having, he thinks
he has not the very things which are in his hold, and as though he had
them not he bewails himself. If he even get all men’s goods, his pain is
but greater. And should he gain an hundred talents, he is vexed that he
hath not received a thousand: and if he received a thousand; he is stung
to the quick that it is not ten thousand: and if he receive ten
thousand, he utterly bemoans himself (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xv-p40.1"></span>κατακόπτεται</span>) because it is not ten times
as much. And the acquisition of more to him becomes so much more
poverty; for the more he receives so much the more he desires. So then,
the more he receives, the more he becomes poor: since whoso desires
more, is more truly poor. When then he hath an hundred talents, is he
not very poor? <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) for he desires a
thousand. When he hath got a thousand, then he becomes yet poorer. For
it is no longer a thousand as before, but ten thousand that he professes
himself to want. Now if you say that to wish and not to obtain is
pleasure, you seem to me to be very ignorant of the nature of pleasure.

<span id="iv.xv-p42"></span>\[9.\] To shew that this sort of thing is
not pleasure but punishment, take another case, and so let us search it
out. When we are thirsty, do we not therefore feel pleasure in drinking
because we quench our thirst; and is it not therefore a pleasure to
drink because it relieves us from a great torment, the desire, I mean,
of drinking? Every one, I suppose, can tell. But were we always to
remain in such a state of desire, we should be as badly off as the rich
man in the parable of Lazarus for the matter of punishment; for his
punishment was just this that vehemently desiring one little drop, he
obtained it not. And this very thing all covetous persons seem to me
continually to suffer, and to resemble him where he begs that he may
obtain that drop, and obtains it not. For their soul is more on fire
than his.

<span id="iv.xv-p43"></span>Well indeed hath one <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) said, that all lovers of money are in a
sort of dropsy; for as they, bearing much water in their bodies, are the
more burnt up: so also the covetous, bearing about with them great
wealth, are greedy of more. The reason is that neither do the one keep
the water in the parts of the body where it should be, nor the other
their desire in the limits of becoming thought.

<span id="iv.xv-p45"></span>Let us then flee this strange and craving
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p45.1"></span>ξένην καὶ</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xv-p45.2"></span>κενὴν</span>: a play
on the sound of the words,) disease; let us flee the root of all evils;
let us flee that which is present hell; for it is a hell, the desire of
these things. Only just lay open the soul of each, of him who despises
wealth and of him who does not so; and you will see that the one is like
the distracted, choosing neither to hear nor see any thing: the other,
like a harbor free from waves:  and he is the friend of all, as the
other is the enemy. For whether one take any thing of his, it gives him
no annoyance; or if whether, on the contrary, one give him aught, it
puffs him not up; but there is a certain freedom about him with entire
security. The one is forced to flatter and feign before all; the other,
to no man.

<span id="iv.xv-p46"></span>If now to be fond of money is to be both
poor and timid and a dissembler and a hypocrite and to be full of fears
and great penal anguish and chastisement: while he that despises wealth
has all the contrary enjoyments: is it not quite plain that virtue is
the more pleasant?

<span id="iv.xv-p47"></span>Now we might have gone through all the other
evils also whereby it is shewn that there is no vice which hath pleasure
in it, had we not spoken before so much at large.

<span id="iv.xv-p48"></span>Wherefore knowing these things, let us
choose virtue; to the end that we may both enjoy such pleasure as is
here, and may attain unto the blessings which are to come, through the
grace and loving-kindness, &c. &c.

<span id="iv.xv-p22"></span> St. Augustin, *cont. Parmen*, iii. 3. “Are
we to suppose that “*the rod*” at all excludes “*love*,” because he has
given this turn to his sentence, ‘Shall I come unto you with a rod,’
*or* ‘in love?’ Nay, the following clause, ‘And in a spirit of
meekness,’ hints what was passing in his mind—that the rod also has in
it love. But love in severity is one thing, love in meekness another
thing. The love is the same, but it works diversely in divers cases.”
