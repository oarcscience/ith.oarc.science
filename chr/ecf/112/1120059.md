<span id="v.x-p2"></span><span id="v.x-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.x-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor. v.

<span id="v.x-p3"></span>For we know, that if the earthly house of our
tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made
with hands, eternal, in the heavens.

<span id="v.x-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.x-p4.1"></span>Again</span> he arouses their zeal because many
trials drew on <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) . For it was
likely that they, in consequence of his absence, were weaker in respect
to this \[need\]. What then saith he? One ought not to wonder that we
suffer affliction; nor to be confounded, for we even reap many gains
thereby. And some of these he mentioned before; for instance, that we
“bear about the dying of Jesus,” and present the greatest proof of His
power: for he says, “that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of
God:” and we exhibit a clear proof of the Resurrection, for, says he,
“that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.” But
since along with these things he said that our inward man is thus made
better also; for “though our outward man is decaying,” saith he, “yet
the inward man is renewed day by day;” showing again that this being
scourged and persecuted is proportionately useful, he adds, that when
this is done thoroughly, then the countless good things will spring up
for those who have endured these things. For lest when thou hearest that
thy outward man perishes, thou shouldest grieve; he says, that when this
is completely effected, then most of all shalt thou rejoice and shalt
come unto a better inheritance <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) .
So that not only ought not one to grieve at its perishing now in part,
but even earnestly to seek for the completion of that destruction, for
this most conducts thee to immortality. Wherefore also he added, “For we
know, that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved: we have
a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.” For since he is urging <span id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md)
again the doctrine of the Resurrection in respect to which they were
particularly unsound; he calls in aid the judgment of his hearers also,
and so establishes it; not however in the same way as before, but, as it
were, arriving at it out of another subject: (for they had been already
corrected:)  and says, “We know that if the earthly house of our
tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens.” Some indeed say that the ‘earthly
house’ is this world; But I should maintain that he alludes rather to
the body. <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md)   But observe, I pray,
how by the terms \[he uses,\] he shows the superiority of the future
things to the present. For having said “earthly” he hath opposed to it
“the heavenly;” having said, “house of tabernacle,” thereby declaring
both that it is easily taken to pieces and is temporary, he hath opposed
to it the “eternal,” for the name “tabernacle” often times denotes
temporariness. Wherefore He saith, “In My Father’s house are many
abiding places.” ([John xiv. 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.x-p8.1"></span>.) But if He anywhere also calls the resting places
of the saints tabernacles; He calls them not tabernacles simply, but
adds an epithet; for he said not, that “they may receive you” into their
tabernacles, but “into the eternal tabernacles.” ([Luke xvi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009)<span id="v.x-p8.2"></span>..md)
Moreover also in that he said, “not made with hands,” he alluded to that
which was made with hands. What then? Is the body made with hands?  By
no means; but he either alludes to the houses here that are made with
hands, or if not this, then he called the body which is not made with
hands, ’a house of tabernacle.’ For he has not used the term in
antithesis and contradistinction <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md)
to this, but to heighten those eulogies and swell those commendations.

<span id="v.x-p10"></span>\[2.\] [2 Cor.
5.2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002.md)<span id="v.x-p10.1"></span>. “For
verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation
which is from heaven.”

<span id="v.x-p11"></span>What habitation? tell me. The incorruptible
body. And why do we groan now? Because that is far better. And “from
heaven” he calls it because of its incorruptibleness. For it is not
surely that a body will come down to us from above: but by this
expression he <span id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span
id="v.x-Page_327"></span>signifies the grace which is sent from thence.
So far then ought we to be from grieving at these trials which are in
part that we ought to seek even for their fulness <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) , as if he had said: Groanest thou,
that thou art persecuted, that this thy man is decaying? Groan that this
is not done unto excess and that it perishes not entirely. Seest thou
how he hath turned round what was said unto the contrary; having proved
that they ought to groan that those things were not done fully; for
which because they were done partially; they groaned. Therefore he
henceforth calls it not a tabernacle, but a house, and with great
reason. For a tabernacle indeed is easily taken to pieces; but a house
abideth continually.

<span id="v.x-p13"></span>[2 Cor.
5.3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#003.md)<span id="v.x-p13.1"></span>. “If
so be that being unclothed <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) we
shall not be found naked.”

<span id="v.x-p15"></span>That is, even if we have put off the body, we
shall not be presented there without a body, but even with the same one
made incorruptible. But some read, and it deserves very much to be
adopted, “If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.” For
lest all should be confident because of the Resurrection, he says, “If
so be that being clothed,” that is, having obtained incorruption and an
incorruptible body, “we shall not be found naked” of glory and safety.
As he also said in the former Epistle; “We shall all be raised; but each
in his own order.” And, “There are celestial bodies, and bodies
terrestial.” ([1 Cor. 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md),
[40](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#040)<span id="v.x-p15.1"></span>..md) For
the Resurrection indeed is common to all, but the glory is not common;
but some shall rise in honor and others in dishonor, and some to a
kingdom but others to punishment. This surely he signified here also,
when he said; “If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.”

<span id="v.x-p16"></span>\[3.\] [2 Cor.
5.4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md)<span id="v.x-p16.1"></span>. “For
indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) , not for that we would be unclothed,
but that we would be clothed upon.” Here again he hath utterly and
manifestly stopped the mouths of the heretics, showing that he is not
speaking absolutely of a body differing in identity <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) , but of corruption and incorruption:
‘For we do not therefore groan,’ saith he, ‘that we may be delivered
from the body: for of this we do not wish to be unclothed; but we hasten
to be delivered from the corruption that is in it.’ Wherefore he saith,
‘we wish not to be unclothed of the body, but that it should be clothed
upon with incorruption.’ Then he also interprets it \[thus,\] “That what
is mortal may be swallowed up of life.” For since putting off the body
appeared to many a grievous thing; and he was contradicting the
judgments of all, when he said, “we groan,” not wishing to be set free
from it; (‘for if,’ says one, ‘the soul in being separated from it so
suffers and laments, how sayest thou that we groan because we are not
separated from it?’) lest then this should be urged against him, he
says, ‘Neither do I assert that we therefore groan, that we may put it
off; (for no one putteth it off without pain, seeing that Christ says
even of Peter, ‘They shall “carry thee,” and lead thee “whither thou
wouldest not;”—[John xxi. 18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md)<span
id="v.x-p18.2"></span>.) but that we may have it clothed upon with
incorruption.’ For it is in this respect that we are burdened by the
body; not because it is a body, but because we are encompassed with a
corruptible body and liable to suffering <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) , for it is this that also causes us
pain. But the life when it arriveth destroyeth and useth up the
corruption; the corruption, I say, not the body. ‘And how cometh this to
pass?’ saith one. Inquire not; God doeth it; be not too curious.
Wherefore also he added,

<span id="v.x-p20"></span>[2 Cor.
5.5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md)<span id="v.x-p20.1"></span>. “Now
he that hath wrought us for this very thing is God.”

<span id="v.x-p21"></span>Hereby he shows that these things were
prefigured from the first. For not now was this decreed: but when at the
first He fashioned us from earth and created Adam; for not for this
created He him, that he should die, but that He might make him even
immortal. Then as showing the credibility of this and furnishing the
proof of it, he added,

<span id="v.x-p22"></span>“Who also gave the earnest of the Spirit.” For
even then He fashioned us for this; and now He hath wrought unto this by
baptism, and hath furnished us with no light security thereof, the Holy
Spirit. And he continually calls It an earnest, wishing to prove God to
be a debtor of the <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) whole, and
thereby also to make what he says more credible unto the grosser
sort. <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md)

<span id="v.x-p25"></span>\[4.\] [2 Cor.
5.6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006.md)<span id="v.x-p25.1"></span>.
“Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing.”

<span id="v.x-p26"></span><span id="page_328">p. 328</span> <span
id="v.x-Page_328"></span>The word “of good courage” is used with
reference to the persecutions, the plottings, and the continual deaths:
as if he had said, ‘Doth any vex and persecute and slay thee? Be not
cast down, for thy good all is done. Be not afraid: but of good courage.
For that which thou groanest and grievest for, that thou art in bondage
to corruption, he removes from henceforward out of the way, and frees
thee the sooner from this bondage.’ Wherefore also he saith, “Being
therefore always of good courage,” not in the seasons of rest only, but
also in those of tribulation; “and knowing,”

<span id="v.x-p27"></span>[2 Cor. 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008.md)<span id="v.x-p27.1"></span>. “That
whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord (for we
walk by faith, not by sight); we are of good courage, I say, and are
willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.”

<span id="v.x-p28"></span>That which is greater than all he has put
last, for to be with Christ is better, than receiving an incorruptible
\[body.\] But what he means is this: ‘He quencheth not our life that
warreth against and killeth us; be not afraid; be of good courage even
when hewn in pieces. For not only doth he set thee free from corruption
and a burden, but he also sendeth thee quickly to the Lord.’ Wherefore
neither did he say, “whilst we ‘are’ in the body:” as of those who are
in a foreign and strange land. “Knowing therefore that whilst we are at
home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: we are of good courage, I
say, and willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the
Lord.” Seest thou how keeping back what was painful, the names of death
and the end, he has employed instead of them such as excite great
longing <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) , calling them presence
with God; and passing over those things which are accounted to be sweet,
the things of life, he hath expressed them by painful names, calling the
life here an absence from the Lord? Now this he did, both that no one
might fondly linger amongst present things, but rather be aweary of
them; and that none when about to die might be disquieted <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) , but might even rejoice as departing
unto greater goods. Then that none might say on hearing that we are
absent from the Lord, ‘Why speakest thou thus? Are we then estranged
from Him whilst we are here?’ he in anticipation corrected <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) such a thought, saying, “For we walk
by faith, not by sight.” Even here indeed we know Him, but not so
clearly. As he says also elsewhere, ([1 Cor. xiii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)<span id="v.x-p31.2"></span>..md) “in a
mirror,” and “darkly.”

<span id="v.x-p32"></span>“We are of good courage, I say, and willing.”
Wonderful! to what hath he brought round the discourse? To an extreme
desire of death, having shown the grievous to be pleasurable, and the
pleasurable grievous. For by the term, “we are willing” he means, ‘we
are desirous.’ Of what are we desirous? Of being “absent from the body,
and at home with the Lord.” And thus he does perpetually, (as I showed
also before) turning round the objection of his opponents unto the very
contrary.

<span id="v.x-p33"></span>[2 Cor.
5.9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009.md)<span id="v.x-p33.1"></span>.
“Wherefore also we make it our aim whether at home or absent, to be well
pleasing unto him.”

<span id="v.x-p34"></span>‘For what we seek for is this,’ saith he,
‘whether we be there or here, to live according to His will; for this is
the principal thing. So that by this thou hast the kingdom already in
possession without a probation.’ For lest when they had arrived at so
great a desire of being there, they should again be disquieted at its
being so long first, in this he gives them already the chief <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) of those good things. And what is
this? To be well “pleasing.” For as to depart is not absolutely good,
but to do so in \[God’s\] favor, which is what makes departing also
become a good; so to remain here is not absolutely grievous, but to
remain offending Him. Deem not then that departure from the body is
enough; for virtue is always necessary. For as when he spoke of a
Resurrection, he allowed \[them\] not by it alone to be of good courage,
saying, “If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked;” so
also having showed a departure, lest thou shouldest think that this is
enough to save thee, he added that it is needful that we be well
pleasing.

<span id="v.x-p36"></span>\[5.\] Seeing then he has persuaded them by
many good things, henceforth he alarms them also by those of gloomier
aspect <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) . For our interest
consists both in the attainment of the good things and the avoidance of
the evil things, in other words, hell and the kingdom. But since this,
the avoiding of punishment, is the more forcible motive; for where
penalty reaches only to the not receiving good things, the most will
bear this contentedly; but if it also extend to the suffering of evil,
do so no longer: (for they ought, indeed, to consider the former
intolerable, but from the weakness and grovelling nature of the many,
the latter appears to them more hard to bear:)  since then (I say) the
giving of the good things doth not so arouse the general hearer as the
threat of the punishments, he is obliged to conclude with this, saying,

<span id="v.x-p38"></span>[2 Cor.
5.10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010.md)<span id="v.x-p38.1"></span>. “For
we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat.”

<span id="v.x-p39"></span>Then having alarmed and shaken <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) the hearer by the mention of that
judgment-seat, he hath <span id="page_329">p. 329</span> <span
id="v.x-Page_329"></span>not even here set down the woful without the
good things, but hath mingled something of pleasure, saying,

<span id="v.x-p41"></span>“That each one may receive the things done in
the body,” as many <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) as “he hath
done, whether” it be “good or bad.”

<span id="v.x-p43"></span>By saying these words, he both reviveth <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) those who have done virtuously and are
persecuted with those hopes, and maketh those who have fallen back more
earnest by that fear. And he thus confirmed his words touching the
resurrection of the body. ‘For surely,’ sayeth he, ‘that which hath
ministered to the one and to the other shall not stand excluded from the
recompenses: but along with the soul shall in the one case be punished,
in the other crowned.’ But some of the heretics say, that it is another
body that is raised. How so? tell me. Did one sin, and is another
punished? Did one do virtuously, and is another crowned? And what will
ye answer to Paul, saying, “We would not be unclothed, but clothed
upon?” And how is that which is mortal “swallowed up of life?” For he
said not, that the mortal or corruptible body should be swallowed up of
the incorruptible body; but that corruption \[should be swallowed up\]
“of life.” For then this happeneth when the same body is raised; but if,
giving up that body, He should prepare another, no longer is corruption
swallowed up but continueth dominant. Therefore this is not so; but
“this corruptible,” that is to say the body, “must put on incorruption.”
For the body is in a middle state <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) , being at present in this and
hereafter to be in that; and for this reason in this first, because it
is impossible for the incorruption to be dissolved. “For neither doth
corruption inherit incorruption,” saith he, (for, how is it \[then\]
incorruption?) but on the contrary, “corruption is swallowed up of
life:” for this indeed survives the other, but not the other this. For
as wax is melted by fire but itself doth not melt the fire: so also doth
corruption melt and vanish away under incorruption, but is never able
itself to get the better of incorruption.

<span id="v.x-p46"></span>\[6.\] Let us then hear the voice of Paul,
saying, that “we must stand at the judgment-seat of Christ;” and let us
picture to ourselves that court of justice, and imagine it to be present
now and the reckoning to be required <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) . For I will speak of it more at
large. For Paul, seeing that he was discoursing on affliction, and he
had no mind to afflict them again, did not dwell on the subject; but
having in brief expressed its austerity <span
id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) , “Each one shall receive according to
what he hath done,” he quickly passed on. Let us then imagine it to be
present now, and reckon each one of us with his own conscience, and
account the Judge to be already present, and everything to be revealed
and brought forth. For we must not merely stand, but also be manifested.
Do ye not blush?  Are ye not astonied? But if now, when the reality is
not yet present, but is granted in supposition merely and imaged in
thought; if now \[I say\] we perish conscience-struck; what shall we do
when \[it\] shall arrive, when the whole world shall be present, when
angels and archangels, when ranks upon ranks, and all hurrying at once,
and some caught up <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) on the
clouds, and an array full of trembling; when there shall be the
trumpets, one upon another, \[when\] those unceasing voices?

<span id="v.x-p50"></span>For suppose there were no hell, yet in the
midst of so great brightness to be rejected and to go away
dishonored;—how great the punishment!  For if even now, when the Emperor
rideth in and his train with him, we contemplating each one of us our
own poverty, derive not so much pleasure from the spectacle, as we
endure dejection at having no share in what is going on about the
Emperor, nor being near the Sovereign; what will it be then? Or thinkest
thou it is a light punishment, not to be ranked in that company, not to
be counted worthy of that unutterable glory, from that assemblage and
those untold good things, to be cast forth some-wither far and distant?
But when there is also darkness, and gnashing of teeth, and chains
indissoluble, and an undying worm, and fire unquenchable, and
affliction, and straitness, and tongues scorching like the rich man’s;
and we wail, and none heareth; and we groan and gnash our teeth for
anguish, and none regardeth; and we look all round, and no where is
there any to comfort us; where shall we rank those that are in this
condition? what is there more miserable than are those souls? what more
pitiable? For if, when we enter a prison and see its inmates, some
squalid, some chained and famishing, some again shut up in darkness, we
are moved with compassion, we shudder, we use all diligence that we may
never be cast into that place; how will it be with us, when we are led
and dragged away into the torture-dungeons <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) themselves of hell? For not of iron
are those chains, but of fire that is never quenched; nor are they that
are set over us our fellows whom it is often possible even to mollify;
but angels whom one may not so much as look in the face, exceedingly
enraged at our insults to their Master. Nor is it given, as here, to see
some bringing in money, some food, some words of comfort, and to meet
with consolation; but all is irremissible there: and though it should be
Noah, <span id="page_330">p. 330</span> <span
id="v.x-Page_330"></span>or Job, or Daniel, and he should see his own
kindred punished, he dares not succor. For even natural sympathy too
comes then to be done away. For since it happeneth that there are
righteous fathers of wicked children, and \[righteous\] children of
\[wicked\] fathers; that so their pleasure may be unalloyed, and those
who enjoy the good things may not be moved with sorrow through the
constraining force of sympathy, even this sympathy, I affirm, is
extinguished, and themselves are indignant together with the Master
against their own bowels. For if the common run of men, when they see
their own children vicious, disown <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) and cut them off from that
relationship; much rather will the righteous then. Therefore let no one
hope for good things, if he have not wrought any good thing, even though
he have ten thousand righteous ancestors. “For each one shall receive
the things done in the body according to what he hath done.” Here he
seems to me to be alluding also to them that commit fornication: and to
raise up as a wall <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) unto them the
fear of that world, not however to them alone; but also to all that in
any wise transgress.

<span id="v.x-p54"></span>\[7.\] Let us hear then, us also. And if thou
have the fire of lust, set against it that other fire, and this will
presently be quenched and gone. And if thou purposest to utter some
harsh sounding <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) \[speech\], think
of the gnashing of teeth, and the fear will be a bridle to thee. And if
thou purposest to plunder, hear the Judge commanding, and saying, “Bind
him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness,” ([Matt. xxii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013)<span id="v.x-p55.3"></span>..md) and
thou wilt cast out this lust also. And if thou art drunken, and
surfeitest continually, hear the rich man saying, ‘Send Lazarus, that
with the tip of his finger he may cool this scorching tongue;’ ([Luke
xvi. 24](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#024)<span id="v.x-p55.4"></span>..md)
yet not obtaining this; and thou wilt hold thyself aloof from that
distemper <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) . But if thou lovest
luxury, think of the affliction and the straitness there, and thou wilt
not think at all of this. If again thou art harsh and cruel, bethink
thee of those virgins who when their lamps had gone out missed so of the
bridal chamber, and thou wilt quickly become humane. Or sluggish art
thou, and remiss? Consider him that hid the talent, and thou wilt be
more vehement than fire. Or doth desire of thy neighbor’s substance
devour thee? Think of the worm that dieth not, and thou wilt easily both
put away from thee this disease, and in all other things wilt do
virtuously. For He hath enjoined nothing irksome or oppressive. Whence
then do His injunctions appear irksome to us? From our own slothfulness.
For as if we labor diligently, even what appears intolerable will be
light and easy; so if we are slothful, even things tolerable will seem
to us difficult. <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md)

<span id="v.x-p58"></span>Considering then all these things, let us
think not of the luxurious, but what is their end; here indeed filth and
obesity, there the worm and fire: not of the rapacious, but what is
their end; cares here, and fears, and anxieties; there chains
indissoluble: not of the lovers of glory, but what these things bring
forth; here slavery and dissemblings, and there both loss intolerable
and perpetual burnings. For if we thus discourse with ourselves, and if
with these and such like things we charm perpetually our evil lusts,
quickly shall we both cast out the love of the present things, and
kindle that of the things to come. Let us therefore kindle it and make
it blaze. For if the conception of them, although a faint sort of one,
affords so great pleasure; think how great the gladness, the manifest
experience itself shall bring us. Blessed, and thrice blessed, yea,
thrice blessed many times, are they who enjoy those good things; just
as, consequently, pitiable and thrice wretched are they Who endure the
opposite of these. That then we may be not of these but those, let us
choose virtue. For so shall we attain unto the good things to come as
well; which may all we attain, through the grace and love towards men of
our Lord Jesus Christ; by Whom, and with Whom, to the Father, together
with the Holy Spirit, be glory, might, and honor, now and for ever, and
world without end. Amen.

<span id="v.x-p8"></span> \[In this view that the building from God is
the resurrection body, Chrysostom has the support of nearly all the
recent expositors—Hodge indeed contends stoutly and ably that the house
not made with hands is heaven itself, yet not with success. For if the
earthly house is a body, the heavenly house must be one also, else the
comparison fails much in force and point; moreover, a body which is said
to be now in heaven and afterwards to come from heaven can hardly be
identical with heaven. C.\]

<span id="v.x-p24"></span> \[The argument of these verses is thus
presented by Beet, *in lo*. “By Christians now death is looked upon
without terrible recoil, as being the only entrance into Life. We bow to
the inevitable. But in the early Christians the possibility of surviving
the coming of Christ woke up with new intensity man’s natural love of
life, and made death seem very dark.  They therefore longed eagerly for
Christ’s return, hoping thus to clothe themselves with immortal raiment
without laying aside their mortal bodies. This yearning for an immortal
body, Paul felt to be divinely implanted, and therefore not doomed to
disappointment. But the possibility of death was to Paul too real to be
ignored. Therefore, in view of it, his yearning for an immortal body
assured him that if his present body be removed by death a heavenly body
awaits him. For otherwise, he will stand before Christ as a naked
spirit, in utter contradiction to yearnings which he felt to be divine
and of whose realization he had a divine pledge. In other words his
instinctive clinging to his present body was to him a divine intimation
that when Christ comes we shall not be naked spirits, but spirits
clothed in bodies; and was therefore a proof that if our present body be
removed by death a heavenly and eternal body awaits us. Thus a purely
human instinct, not weakened but intensified by Christianity, and
sanctified by the felt presence of the Holy Spirit, is seen to be a
prophecy of God’s purpose concerning us. Similar argument in [Romans
viii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md)<span id="v.x-p24.1"></span>.”

<span id="v.x-p57"></span> \[Chrysostom appears distinctly to accept the
common faith of the church that the things done in the body (literally,
“through the body,” as the channel by which purposes pass into actions)
furnish the basis upon which the last assize proceeds. He makes no
reference to any *post mortem* probation, but (on pages 331, 332)
asserts the contrary, “Here the opportunities of salvation exist, but
there are found no longer.” Nor is his view of the retributions of the
judgment inconsistent with his repeated assertions of salvation as
wholly gratuitous. Entrance into eternal life is God’s free gift to all
who believe. But the degree of glory will be measured by the
faithfulness of service, just as the degree of the punishment of the
lost will be by the number and aggravation of their sins. Hence it
follows that although the salvation of any is due to God’s undeserved
favor, still each one that stands at the bar will receive an exact
recompense for his entire conduct in the days of his flesh. “A
remembrance of this exact recompense,” it has well been said, “will make
us comparatively indifferent about life or death, and emulous so to act
as to please our Judge.” C.\]
