<span id="iv.xxxix-p2"></span><span id="iv.xxxix-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xxxix-p2.2"></span>[1 Cor.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p3"></span>*Now I make known unto you, brethren, the
gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also
ye stand; by which also ye are saved: in what words I preached it unto
you.* <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md)

<span id="iv.xxxix-p5"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iv.xxxix-p5.1"></span>Having</span> finished the discourse of
spiritual gifts, he passes to that which is of all most necessary, the
subject of the resurrection. For in this too they were greatly unsound.
And as in men’s bodies, when the fever lays actual hold of their solid
parts, I mean the nerves and the veins and the primary elements, the
mischief becomes incurable unless it receive much attention; just so at
that time also it was like to happen. Since to the very elements of
godliness the mischief was proceeding. Wherefore also Paul uses great
earnestness. For not of morals was his discourse henceforth nor about
one man’s being a fornicator, another covetous, and another having his
head covered; but about the very sum of all good things. For touching
the resurrection itself they were at variance. Because this being all
our hope, against this point did the devil make a vehement stand, and at
one time he was wholly subverting it, at another his word was that it
was “past already;” which also Paul writing to Timothy called a
gangrene, I mean, this wicked doctrine, and those that brought it in he
branded, saying, “Of whom is Hymenœus and Philetus, who concerning the
truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and
overthrow the faith of some.” ([2 Tim.
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018)<span id="iv.xxxix-p5.2"></span>..md)
At one time then they said thus, but at another that the body rises not
again but the purification of the soul is the resurrection.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p6"></span>But these things that wicked demon
persuaded them to say, not wishing to overturn the resurrection only,
but also to show that all the things done for our sakes are a fable. For
if they were persuaded that there is no resurrection of bodies, he would
have gradually persuaded them that neither was Christ raised. And
thereupon he would introduce also this in due course, that He had not
come nor had done what He did. For such is the craft of the devil.
Wherefore also Paul calls it “cunning craftiness <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) ,” because he doth not straightway
signify what he intends to effect, for fear of being detected, but
dressing himself up in a mask of one kind, he fabricates arts of another
kind: and like a crafty enemy attacking a city with walls, he secretly
undermines it from below: so as thereby to be hardly guarded against and
to succeed in his endeavors. Therefore such snares on his part being
continually detected, and these his crafty ambushes hunted out by this
admirable and mighty man, he said, “For we are not ignorant of his
devices.” ([2 Cor. ii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p7.3"></span>.) So also here he unfolds his whole guile and
points out all his stratagems, and whatsoever he would fain effect, Paul
puts before us, with much exactness going over all. Yea, and therefore
he put this head after the rest, both because it was extremely necessary
and because it involves the whole of our condition.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p8"></span>And observe his consideration: how first
having secured his own, he then proceeds even beyond in his discourse,
and them that are without he doth abundantly reduce to silence. Now he
secures his own, not by reasonings, but by things which had already
happened and which themselves had received and believed to have taken
place: a thing which was most of all apt to shame them, and capable of
laying hold on them. Since if they were unwilling to believe after this,
it was no longer Paul but themselves they would disbelieve: which thing
was a censure on those who had once for all received it and changed
their minds. For this cause then he begins also from hence, implying
that he needs no other witnesses to prove his speaking truth, but those
very persons who were deceived.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p9"></span>\[2.\] But that what I say may become
clearer, we must needs in what follows attend to the very words. What
then are these? “I make known unto you, brethren,” saith he, “the gospel
which I preached unto you.” Seest thou with what modesty he commences?
Seest thou how from the beginning he points out that he is bringing in
no new nor strange thing? For he who “maketh known” that which was
already known but afterwards had fallen into oblivion, “maketh known” by
recalling it into memory.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p10"></span><span id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span
id="iv.xxxix-Page_227"></span>And when he called them “brethren,” even
from hence he laid the foundation of no mean part of the proof of his
assertions. For by no other cause became we “brethren,” but by the
dispensation of Christ according to the flesh. And this is just the
reason why he thus called them, at the same time soothing and courting
them, and likewise reminding them of their innumerable blessings.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p11"></span>And what comes next again is
demonstrative of the same. What then is this? “The gospel.” For the sum
of the gospels hath its original hence, from God having become man and
having been crucified and having risen again. This gospel also Gabriel
preached to the Virgin, this also the prophets to the world, this also
the apostles all of them.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p12"></span>“Which I preached unto you, which also ye
received, wherein also ye stand. By which also ye are saved, in what
word I preached unto you; if ye hold it fast, except ye believed in
vain.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p13"></span>Seest thou how he calls themselves to be
witnesses of the things spoken? And he saith not, “which ye heard,” but,
“which ye received,” demanding it of them as a kind of deposit, and
showing that not in word only, but also by deeds and signs and wonders
they received it, and that they should hold it safe.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p14"></span>Next, because he was speaking of the
things long past, he referred also to the present time, saying, “wherein
also ye stand,” taking the vantage ground of them that disavowal might
be out of their power, though they wished it never so much. And this is
why at the beginning he said not, “I teach you,” but, ‘I make known unto
you’ what hath already been made manifest.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p15"></span>And how saith he that they who were so
tossed with waves “stand?” He feigns ignorance to profit them; which
also he doth in the case of the Galatians, but not in like manner. For
inasmuch as he could not in that case affect ignorance, he frames his
address in another way, saying, “I have confidence toward you in the
Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded.” ([Gal. v.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010)<span id="iv.xxxix-p15.1"></span>..md)
He said not, “that ye were none otherwise minded,” because their fault
was acknowledged and evident, but he answers for the future; and yet
this too was uncertain; but it was to draw them to him more effectually.
Here however he doth feign ignorance, saying, “wherein also ye stand.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p16"></span>Then comes the advantage; “by which also
ye are saved, in what words I preached it unto you.” “So then, this
present exposition is for doctrine clearness and interpretation. For the
doctrine itself ye need not,” saith he, “to learn, but to be reminded of
it and corrected.” And these things he saith, leaving them no room to
plunge into recklessness once for all.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p17"></span>But what is, “in what word I preached it
unto you?” After what manner did I say,” saith he, “that the
resurrection takes place? For that there is a resurrection I would not
say that ye doubt: but ye seek perhaps to obtain a clearer knowledge of
that saying. This then will I provide for you: for indeed I am well
assured that ye hold the doctrine.” Next, because he was directly
affirming, “wherein also ye stand;” that he might not thereby make them
more remiss, he alarms them again, saying, “If ye hold it fast, except
ye believed in vain;” intimating that the stroke is on the chief head,
and the contest for no common things but in behalf of the whole of the
faith. And for the present he saith it with reserve, but as he goes on
and waxes warm, he throws off the veil and proceeds to cry out <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) , and say, “But if Christ hath not
been raised then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain:  ye are
yet in your sins:” but in the beginning not so: for thus it was
expedient to proceed, gently and by degrees.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p19"></span>[1 Cor.
15.3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.xxxix-p19.1"></span>.
“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p20"></span>Neither here doth he say, “I said unto
you,” nor, “I taught you,” but uses the same expression again, saying,
“I delivered unto you that which also I received:” nor again here doth
he say, “I was taught,” but, “I received:” establishing these two
things; first, that one ought to introduce nothing from one’s self;
next, that by demonstration from his deeds they were fully persuaded,
not by bare words: and by degrees while he is rendering his argument
credible, he refers the whole to Christ, and signifies that nothing was
of man in these doctrines.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p21"></span>But what is this, “For I delivered unto
you first of all? <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) ” for that is
his word. “In the beginning, not now.” And thus saying he brings the
time for a witness, and that it were the greatest disgrace for those who
had so long time been persuaded now to change their minds: and not this
only, but also that the doctrine is necessary. Wherefore also it was
“delivered” among “the first,” and from the beginning straightway. And
what didst thou so deliver? tell me. But this he doth not say
straightway, but first, “I received.” And what didst thou receive? “That
Christ died for our sins.”  He said not immediately that there is a
resurrection of our bodies, yet this very thing in truth he doth
establish, but afar off and by other topics saying that “Christ died,”
and laying before a kind of strong base and <span id="page_228">p.
228</span> <span id="iv.xxxix-Page_228"></span>irrefragable foundation
of the doctrine concerning the resurrection. For neither did he simply
say that “Christ died;” although even this were sufficient to declare
the resurrection, but with an addition, “Christ died for our sins.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p23"></span>\[3.\] But first it is worth while to
hear what those who are infected with the Manichæan doctrines say here,
who are both enemies to the truth and war against their own salvation.
What then do these allege? By death here, they say, Paul means nothing
else than our being in sin; and by resurrection, our being delivered
from our sins. Seest thou how nothing is weaker than error? And how it
is taken by its own wings, and needs not the warfare from without, but
by itself it is pierced through? Consider, for instance, these men, how
they too have pierced themselves through by their own statements. Since
if this be death, and Christ did not take a body, as ye suppose, and yet
died, He was in sin according to you. For I indeed say that He took unto
Himself a body and His death, I say, was that of the flesh; but thou
denying this, wilt be compelled to affirm the other. But if He was in
sin, how saith He, “Which of you convinceth Me of sin?” and “The prince
of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me?” ([John
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046.md), [John
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p23.1"></span>.) and again, “Thus it becometh Us to fulfill
all righteousness?” ([Matt. iii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015)<span id="iv.xxxix-p23.2"></span>..md)
Nay, how did He at all die for sinners, if Himself were in sin? For he
who dies for sinners ought himself to be without sin. Since if he
himself also sin, how shall he die for other sinners? But if for others’
sins He died, He died being without sin: and if being without sin He
died, He died—not the death of sin; for how could He being without
sin?—but the death of the body. Wherefore also Paul did not simply say,
“He died,” but added, “for our sins:” both forcing these heretics
against their will to the confession of His bodily death, and signifying
also by this that before death He was without sin: for he that dies for
others’ sins, it followeth must himself be without sin.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p24"></span>Neither was he content with this, but
added, “according to the Scriptures:” hereby both again making his
argument credible, and intimating what kind of death he was speaking of:
since it is the death of the body which the Scriptures everywhere
proclaim. For, “they pierced My hands and My feet,” ([Ps. xxi.
18](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#018)<span id="iv.xxxix-p24.1"></span>..md)
saith He, and, “they shall look on Him Whom they pierced.” ([John
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037.md), [Zech.
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p24.2"></span>.) And many other instances, too not to name
all one by one, partly in words and partly in types, one may see in them
stored up, setting forth His slaughter in the flesh and that He was
slain for our sins. For, “for the sins of my people,” saith one, “is He
come <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) to death:” and, “the Lord
delivered Him up for our sins:” and, “He was wounded for our
transgressions.” ([Is. liii](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p25.5"></span>.) But if thou <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) dost not endure the Old Testament,
hear John crying out and declaring both, as well His slaughter in the
body as the cause of it: thus, “Behold,” saith he, “the Lamb of God, Who
taketh away the sin of the world:” ([John i.
29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029)<span id="iv.xxxix-p26.1"></span>..md)
and Paul saying, “For Him Who knew no sin, He made to be sin on our
behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him:” ([2 Cor.
v. 21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p26.2"></span>.) and again, “Christ redeemed us from the
curse of the law, having become a curse for us:” ([Gal. iii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)<span id="iv.xxxix-p26.3"></span>..md)
and again, “having put off from himself principalities and powers, He
made a show of them openly, triumphing over them;” ([Col. ii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015)<span id="iv.xxxix-p26.4"></span>..md)
and ten thousand other sayings to show what happened at His death in the
body, and because of our sins. Yea, and Christ Himself saith, “for your
sakes I sanctify Myself <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) ” and,
“now the prince of this world hath been condemned <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) ;” showing that having no sin he was
slain.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p29"></span>\[4.\]  [1 Cor.
15.4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.xxxix-p29.1"></span>.
“And that he was buried.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p30"></span>And this also confirms the former topics,
for that which is buried is doubtless a body. And here he no longer
adds, “according to the Scriptures.” He had wherewithal, nevertheless he
adds it not. For what cause? Either because the burial was evident unto
all, both then and now, or because the expression, “according to the
Scriptures,” is set down of both in common. Wherefore then doth he add,
“according to the Scriptures,” in this place, “and that He rose on the
third day according to the Scriptures,” and is not content with the
former clause, so spoken in common? Because this also was to most men
obscure: wherefore here again he brings in “the Scriptures” by
inspiration, having so conceived this thought so wise and divine.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p31"></span>How is it then that he doth the same in
regard of His death <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) ? Because in
that case too, although the cross was evident unto all and in the sight
of all He was stretched upon it; yet the cause was no longer equally so.
The fact indeed of his death all knew, but that He suffered this for the
sins of the world was no longer equally known to the multitude.
Wherefore he brings in the testimony from the Scriptures.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p33"></span>This however hath been sufficiently
proved by what we have said. But where have the Scrip<span
id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span id="iv.xxxix-Page_229"></span>tures
said that He was buried, and on the third day shall rise again? By the
type of Jonah which also Himself alleges, saying, “As Jonah was three
days and three nights in the whale’s belly, so shall also the Son of Man
be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” ([Matt. xii.
40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040)<span id="iv.xxxix-p33.1"></span>..md)
By the bush in the desert. For even as that burned, yet was not
consumed, ([Exod. iii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p33.2"></span>.) so also that body died indeed, but was not
holden of death continually <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) .
And the dragon also in Daniel shadows out this. For as the dragon having
taken the food which the prophet gave, burst asunder in the midst; <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) even so Hades having swallowed down
that Body, was rent asunder, the Body of itself cutting asunder its womb
and rising again.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p36"></span>Now if thou desirest to hear also in
words those things which thou hast seen in types, listen to Isaiah,
saying, “His life is taken from the earth,” ([Isa.
53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p36.1"></span>.) <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md)
and,” it pleaseth the Lord to cleanse Him from His wound…to show unto
Him light:” and David before him, “Thou wilt not leave My soul to Hades,
nor wilt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption.” ([Ps. xvi.
10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010)<span id="iv.xxxix-p37.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxxix-p38"></span>Therefore Paul also sends thee on to the
Scriptures, that thou mayest learn that not without cause nor at random
were these things done. For how could they, when so many prophets are
describing and proclaiming them beforehand? And no where doth the
Scripture mean the death of sin, when it makes mention of our Lord’s
death, but that of the body, and a burial and resurrection of the same
kind.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p39"></span>\[5.\] [1 Cor.
15.5](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.xxxix-p39.1"></span>.
“And that He appeared to Cephas:” he names immediately the most credible
of all. “Then to the twelve.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p40"></span>[1 Cor.
15.6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.xxxix-p40.1"></span>.
“Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the
greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p41"></span>[1 Cor.
15.7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.xxxix-p41.1"></span>.
“Then he appeared to James; then to all the Apostles.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p42"></span>[1 Cor.
15.8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.xxxix-p42.1"></span>.
“And last of all, as unto one born out of due time, he appeared to me
also.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p43"></span>Thus, since he had mentioned the proof
from the Scriptures, he adds also that by the events, producing as
witnesses of the resurrection, after the prophets, the apostles and
other faithful men. Whereas if he meant that other resurrection, the
deliverance from sin, it were idle for him to say, He appeared to such
and such an one; for this is the argument of one who is establishing the
resurrection of the body, not of one obscurely teaching deliverance from
sins. Wherefore neither said he once for all, “He appeared,” although it
were sufficient for him to do so, setting down the expression in common:
but now both twice and thrice, and almost in each several case of them
that had seen Him he employs it. For “He appeared,” saith he, “to
Cephas, He appeared to above five hundred brethren, He appeared to me
also.” Yet surely the Gospel saith the contrary, that He was seen of
Mary first. ([Mark xvi. 9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p43.1"></span>.) But among men He was seen of him first who
did most of all long to see Him.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p44"></span>But of what twelve apostles doth he here
speak <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) ? For after He was
received up, Matthias was taken into the number, not after the
resurrection immediately. But it is likely that He appeared even after
He was received up. At any rate, this our apostle himself after His
ascension was both called, and saw Him. Therefore neither doth he set
down the time, but simply and without defining recounts the appearance.
For indeed it is probable that many took place; wherefore also John
said, “This third time He was manifested.” ([John xxi.
14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#014)<span id="iv.xxxix-p45.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxxix-p46"></span>“Then He appeared to above five hundred
brethren.” Some say that “above <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md)
,” is above from heaven; that is, “not walking upon earth, but above and
overhead He appeared to them:” adding, that it was Paul’s purpose to
confirm, not the resurrection only, but also the ascension. Others say
that the expression, “above five hundred,” means, “more than five
hundred.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p48"></span>“Of whom the greater part remain until
now.” Thus, “though I relate events of old,” saith he, “yet have I
living witnesses.” “But some are fallen asleep.” He said not, “are
dead,” but, “are fallen asleep,” by this expression also again
confirming the resurrection. “After that, He was seen of James.” I
suppose, His brother. For the Lord is said to have Himself ordained him
and made him Bishop in Jerusalem first. “Then to all the apostles.” For
there were also other apostles, as the seventy.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p49"></span>“And last of all he appeared unto me
also, as unto one born out of due time.” This is rather an expression of
modesty than any thing <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span
id="iv.xxxix-Page_230"></span>else. For not because he was the least,
therefore did he appear to him after the rest. Since even if He did call
him last, yet he appeared more illustrious than many which were before
him, yea rather than all. And the five hundred brethren too were not
surely better than James, because He appeared to them before him.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p50"></span>Why did He not appear to all at the same
time?  That He might first sow the seeds of faith. For he that saw Him
first and was exactly and fully assured, told it unto the residue: then
their report coming first placed the hearer in expectation of this great
wonder, and made way before for the faith of sight. Therefore neither
did He appear to all together, nor in the beginning to many, but to one
alone first, and him the leader of the whole company and the most
faithful: since indeed there was great need of a most faithful soul to
be first to receive this sight. For those who saw him after others had
seen him, and heard it from them, had in their testimony what
contributed in no small degree to their own faith and tended to prepare
their mind beforehand; but he who was first counted worthy to see Him,
had need, as I have said, of great faith, not to be confounded by a
sight so contrary to expectation. Therefore he appears to Peter first.
For he that first confessed Him to be Christ was justly also counted
worthy first to behold His resurrection. And not on this account alone
doth He appear to him first, but also because he had denied Him, more
abundantly to comfort him and to signify that he is not despaired of,
before the rest He vouchsafed him even this sight and to him first
entrusted His sheep. Therefore also He appeared to the women first.
Because this sex was made inferior, therefore both in His birth and in
His resurrection this first tastes of His grace.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p51"></span>But after Peter, He appears also to each
at intervals, and at one time to fewer, at another to more, hereby
making them witnesses and teachers of each other, and rendering His
apostles trustworthy in all that they said.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p52"></span>\[6.\] “And last of all, as unto one born
out of due time, he appeared to me also.” What mean here his expressions
of humility, or wherein are they seasonable? For if he wishes to show
himself worthy of credit and to enrol himself among the witnesses of the
resurrection, he is doing the contrary of what he wishes: since it were
meet that he exalt himself and show that he was great, which in many
places he doth, the occasion calling for it. Well, the very reason why
he here also speaks modestly is his being about to do this. Not
straightway, however, but with his own peculiar good sense: in that
having first spoken modestly and heaped up against himself many charges,
he then magnifies the things concerning himself. What may the reason be?
That, when he comes to utter that great and lofty expression concerning
himself, “I labored more abundantly than all,” his discourse may be
rendered more acceptable, both hereby, and by its being spoken as a
consequence of what went before and not as a leading topic. Therefore
also writing to Timothy, and intending to say great things concerning
himself, he first sets down his charges against himself. For so all
persons, when speaking in high terms of others, speak out freely and
with boldness: but he that is compelled to praise himself, and
especially when he also calls himself to witness, is disconcerted and
blushes. Therefore also this blessed man first declares his own misery,
and then utters that lofty expression. This then he doth, partly to
abate the offensiveness of speaking about himself, and partly that he
might hereby recommend to their belief what he had to say afterwards.
For he that truly states what things are discreditable to him and
conceals none of them, such as that he persecuted the Church, that he
laid waste the faith, doth hereby cause the things that are honorable to
him also to be above suspicion.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p53"></span>And consider the exceeding greatness of
his humility. For having said, “and last of all He appeared to me also,”
he was not content with this: “For many that are last shall be first,”
saith He, “and the first last.” ([Matt. xx.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016)<span id="iv.xxxix-p53.1"></span>..md)
Therefore he added, “as unto one born out of due time.” Neither did he
stop here, but adds also his own judgment and with a reason, saying,

<span id="iv.xxxix-p54"></span>[1 Cor.
15.9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.xxxix-p54.1"></span>.
“For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an
apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p55"></span>And he said not, of the twelve alone, but
also of all the other apostles. And all these things he spake, both as
one speaking modestly and because he was really so disposed as I said,
making arrangements also beforehand for what was intended to be spoken
and rendering it more acceptable. For had he come forward and said, “Ye
ought to believe me that Christ rose from the dead; for I saw Him and of
all I am the most worthy of credit, inasmuch as I have labored more,”
the expression might have offended the hearers: but now by first
dwelling on the humiliating topics and those which involve accusation,
he both took off what might be grating in such a narrative, and prepared
the way for their belief in his testimony.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p56"></span>On this account therefore neither doth he
simply, as I said, declare himself to be the last and unworthy of the
appellation of an apostle, but also states the reason, saying, “because
I persecuted the Church.” And yet all those things were forgiven, but
nevertheless he himself never forgot them, desiring to signify the
greatness of God’s favor: wherefore also he goes on to say,

<span id="iv.xxxix-p57"></span><span id="page_231">p. 231</span> <span
id="iv.xxxix-Page_231"></span>\[7.\] [1 Cor.
15.10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p57.1"></span>. “But by the grace of God I am what I am.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p58"></span>Seest thou again another <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) excess of humility? in that the
defects he imputes to himself, but of the good deeds nothing; rather he
refers all to God. Next, lest he might hereby render his hearer supine,
he saith, “And His grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain.”
And this again with reserve: in that he said not, “I have displayed a
diligence worthy of His grace,” but, “it was not found vain.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p60"></span>“But I labored more abundantly than they
all.” He said not, “I was honored,” but, “I labored;” and when he had
perils and deaths to speak of, by the name of labor he again abates his
expression.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p61"></span>Then again practicing his wonted
humility, this also he speedily passes by and refers the whole to God,
saying, “Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.” What can be
more admirable than such a soul? who having in so many ways depressed
himself and uttered but one lofty word, not even this doth he call his
own; on every side finding ways, both from the former things and from
them that follow after, to contract this lofty expression, and that
because it was of necessity that he came to it.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p62"></span>But consider how he abounds in the
expressions of humility. For so, “to me last of all He appeared,” saith
he. Wherefore neither doth he with himself mention any other, and saith,
“as of one born out of due time,” and that himself is “the least of the
apostles,” and not even worthy of this appellation. And he was not
content even with these, but that he might not seem in mere words to be
humble-minded, he states both reasons and proofs: of his being “one born
out of due time,” his seeing Jesus last; and of his being unworthy even
of the name of an apostle, “his persecuting the Church.” For he that is
simply humble-minded doeth not this: but he that also sets down the
reasons utters all from a contrite mind. Wherefore also he elsewhere
makes mention of these same things, saying, “And I thank him that
enabled me; even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that He counted me faithful,
appointing the to his service, though I was before a blasphemer, and a
persecutor, and injurious.” ([1 Tim.
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013)<span id="iv.xxxix-p62.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxxix-p63"></span>But wherefore did he utter at all that
same lofty expression, “I labored more abundantly than they?” He saw
that the occasion compelled him. For had he not said this, had he only
depreciated himself, how could he with boldness call himself to witness,
and number himself with the rest, and say,

<span id="iv.xxxix-p64"></span>[1 Cor.
15.11](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p64.1"></span>. “Whether then it be I or they, so we
preach.”

<span id="iv.xxxix-p65"></span>For the witness ought to be trustworthy,
and a great man. But how he “labored more abundantly than they,” he
indicated above, saying, “Have we no right to eat and to drink, as also
the other Apostles?” And again, “to them that are without law as without
law.” Thus, both where exactness was to be displayed, he overshot all:
and where there was need to condescend, he displayed again the same
great superiority.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p66"></span>But some cite his being sent to the
Gentiles and his overrunning the larger part of the world. Whence it is
evident that he enjoyed more grace. For if he labored more, the grace
was also more: but he enjoyed more grace, because he displayed also more
diligence. Seest thou how by those particulars whereby he contends and
strives to throw into shade the things concerning himself, he is shown
to be first of all?

<span id="iv.xxxix-p67"></span>\[8.\] And these things when we hear, let
us also make open show of our defects, but of our excellencies let us
say nothing. Or if the opportunity force it upon us, let us speak of
them with reserve and impute the whole to God’s grace: which accordingly
the Apostle also doth, ever and anon putting a bad mark upon his former
life, but his after-state imputing to grace, that he might signify the
mercy of God from every circumstance: from His having saved him such as
he was and when saved making him again such as he is. Let none
accordingly of those who are in sin despair, let none of those in virtue
be confident, but let the one be exceeding fearful and the other
forward. For neither shall any slothful man be able to abide in virtue,
nor one that is diligent be weak to escape from evil. And of both these
the blessed David is an example, who after he slumbered a little, had a
great downfall: and when he was pricked in his heart, again hastened up
to his former height. Since in fact both are alike evils, both despair
and slothfulness; the one quickly casting a man down from the very arch
of the heavens; the other not suffering the fallen to rise again.
Wherefore with respect to the one, Paul said, “Let him that thinketh he
standeth take heed lest he fall:” ([1 Cor. x.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012)<span id="iv.xxxix-p67.1"></span>..md)
but unto the other, “To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your
hearts:  ([Heb. iv. 7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p67.2"></span>.) and again, “Lift up the hands that hang
down and the palsied knees.” ([Heb. xii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012)<span id="iv.xxxix-p67.3"></span>..md)
And him too that had committed fornication but repented, he therefore
quickly refreshes, “that such an one might not be swallowed up with his
overmuch sorrow?” ([2 Cor. ii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.xxxix-p67.4"></span>.)

<span id="iv.xxxix-p68"></span>Why then in regard of other griefs art
thou cast down, O man? Since if for sins, where only grief is
beneficial, excess works much mischief, much more for all other things.
For wherefore grievest thou? That thou hast lost money? Nay, think of
those that are not even <span id="page_232">p. 232</span> <span
id="iv.xxxix-Page_232"></span>filled with bread, and thou shalt very
speedily obtain consolation. And in each of the things that are grievous
to thee mourn not the things that have happened, but for the disasters
that have not happened give thanks. Hadst thou money and didst thou lose
it? Weep not for the loss, but give thanks for the time when thou didst
enjoy it. Say like Job, “Have we received good at the hand of the Lord,
and shall we not receive evil?” ([Job ii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010)<span id="iv.xxxix-p68.1"></span>..md)
And together with that use this argument also; that even if thou didst
lose thy money, yet thy body thou hast still sound and hast not with thy
poverty to grieve that it also is maimed. But hath thy body too endured
some outrage? Yet is not this the bottom of human calamities, but in the
middle of the cask thou art as yet carried along. For many along with
poverty and maiming, both wrestle with a demon and wander in deserts:
others again endure other things more grievous than these. For may it
never be our lot to suffer all that it is possible for one to bear.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p69"></span>These things then ever considering, bear
in mind them that suffer worse, and be vexed at none of those things:
but when thou sinnest, only then sigh, then weep; I forbid thee not, nay
I enjoin thee rather; though even then with moderation, remembering that
there is returning, there is reconciliation. But seest thou others in
luxury and thyself in poverty: and another in goodly robes, and in
preeminence? Look not however on these things alone, but also on the
miseries that arise out of these. And in thy poverty too, consider not
the beggary alone, but the pleasure also thence arising do thou take
into account. For wealth hath indeed a cheerful mask, but its inward
parts are full of gloom; and poverty the reverse. And shouldest thou
unfold each man’s conscience, in the soul of the poor thou wilt see
great security and freedom: but in that of the rich, confusions,
disorders, tempests. And if thou grievest, seeing him rich, he too is
vexed much more than thou when he beholds one richer than himself. And
as thou fearest him, even so doth he another, and he hath no advantage
over thee in this. But thou art vexed to see him in office, because thou
art in a private station and one of the governed. Recollect however the
day of his ceasing to hold office. And even before that day the tumults,
the perils, the fatigues, the flatteries, the sleepless nights, and all
the miseries.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p70"></span>\[9.\] And these things we say to those
who have no mind for high morality: since if thou knowest this, there
are other and greater things whereby we may comfort thee: but for the
present we must use the coarser topics to argue with thee. When
therefore thou seest one that is rich, think of him that is richer than
he, and thou wilt see him in the same condition with thyself. And after
him look also on him that is poorer than thyself, consider how many have
gone to bed hungry, and have lost their patrimony, and live in a
dungeon, and pray for death every day. For neither doth poverty breed
sadness, nor wealth pleasure, but both the one and the other our own
thoughts are wont to produce in us. And consider, beginning from
beneath: the scavenger grieves and is vexed that he cannot be rid of
this his business so wretched and esteemed so disgraceful: but if thou
rid him of this, and cause him, with security, to have plenty of the
necessaries of life, he will grieve again that he hath not more than he
wants: and if thou grant him more, he will wish to double them again,
and will therefore vex himself no less than before:  and if thou grant
him twofold or threefold, he will be out of heart again because he hath
no part in the state: and if you provide him with this also, he will
count himself wretched because he is not one of the highest officers of
state. And when he hath obtained this honor, he will mourn that he is
not a ruler; and when he shall be ruler, that it is not of a whole
nation; and when of a whole nation, that it is not of many nations; and
when of many nations, that it is not of all. When he becomes a deputy,
he will vex himself again that he is not a king; and if a king, that he
is not so alone; and if alone, that he is not also of barbarous nations;
and if of barbarous nations, that he is not of the whole world even: and
if of the whole world, why not likewise of another world? And so his
course of thought going on without end does not suffer him ever to be
pleased. Seest thou, how even if from being mean and poor thou shouldest
make a man a king, thou dost not remove his dejection, without first
correcting his turn of thought, enamored as it is of having more?

<span id="iv.xxxix-p71"></span>Come, let me show thee the contrary too,
that even if from a higher station thou shouldest bring down to a lower
one him that hath consideration, thou wilt not cast him into dejection
and grief. And if thou wilt, let us descend the same ladder, and do thou
bring down the satrap from his throne and in supposition deprive him of
that dignity. I say that he will not on this account vex himself, if he
choose to bear in mind the things of which I have spoken. For he will
not reckon up the things of which he hath been deprived, but what he
hath still, the glory arising from his office. But if thou take away
this also, he will reckon up them who are in private stations and have
never ascended to such sway, and for consolation his riches will suffice
him. And if thou also cast him out again from this, he will look to them
that have a moderate estate. And if thou shouldest take <span
id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span id="iv.xxxix-Page_233"></span>away
even moderate wealth, and shouldest allow him to partake only of
necessary food, he may think upon them that have not even this, but
wrestle with incessant hunger and live in prison. And even if thou
shouldest bring him into that prison-house, when he reflects on them
that lie under incurable diseases and irremediable pains, he will see
himself to be in much better circumstances. And as the scavenger before
mentioned not even on being made a king will reap any cheerfulness, so
neither will this man ever vex himself if he become a prisoner. It is
not then wealth that is the foundation of pleasure, nor poverty of
sadness, but our own judgment, and the fact, that the eyes of our mind
are not pure, nor are fixed anywhere and abide, but without limit
flutter abroad. And as healthy bodies, if they be nourished with bread
alone, are in good and vigorous condition: but those that are sickly,
even if they enjoy a plentiful and varied diet, become so much the
weaker; so also it is wont to happen in regard of the soul. The mean
spirited, not even in a diadem and unspeakable honors can be happy: but
the denying, even in bonds and fetters and poverty, will enjoy a pure
pleasure.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p72"></span>\[10.\] These things then bearing in
mind, let us ever look to them that are beneath us. There is indeed, I
grant, another consolation, but of a high strain in morality, and
mounting above the grossness of the multitude. What is this? That wealth
is naught, poverty is naught, disgrace is naught, honor is naught, but
for a brief time and only in words do they differ from each other. And
along with this there is another soothing topic also, greater than it;
the consideration of the things to come, both evil and good, the things
which are really evil and really good, and the being comforted by them.
But since many, as I said, stand aloof from these doctrines, therefore
were we compelled to dwell on other topics, that in course we might lead
on to them the receivers of what had been said before.

<span id="iv.xxxix-p73"></span>Let us then, taking all these things into
account, by every means frame ourselves aright, and we shall never
grieve at these unexpected things. For neither if we should see men rich
in a picture, should we say they were to be envied, any more than on
seeing poor men there depicted we should call them wretched and
pitiable: although those are surely more abiding than they whom we
reckon wealthy. Since one abides rich in the picture longer than in the
nature itself of things. For the one often lasts, appearing such, even
to a hundred years, but the other sometimes, not having had so much as a
year to live at his ease in his possessions, hath been suddenly stripped
of all. Meditating then on all these things, let us from all quarters
build up cheerfulness as an outwork against our irrational sorrow, that
we may both pass the present life with pleasure, and obtain the good
things to come, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with Whom to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor,
now and forever, and world without end. Amen.

(*in Exod*. t. i. p. 263.) of the Divine Nature inhabiting the Human,
yet not consuming it, in the person of our Lord. Theodoret (*in loc*.)
says, “The power and mercy of God are proclaimed by the circumstance,
that the bush being mere brushwood was not consumed by the unquenchable
fire: I think however that other intimations are conveyed by this
circumstance:  as that Israel, plotted against by the Egyptians, should
not be consumed, but overcome his enemies; and that the Only-Begotten,
being made incarnate and dwelling in the Virgin’s Womb, shall keep that
virginity inviolate.” Tertull. (*adv. Gnost*. c. 1.) alludes to it, as
representing the Church in the fire of persecution.
