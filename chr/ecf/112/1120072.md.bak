<span id="v.xxiii-p3"></span>*Would that ye could bear with me in a
little foolishness and, indeed ye do bear with me.* <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md)

<span id="v.xxiii-p5"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.xxiii-p5.1"></span>Being</span> about to enter upon his own
praises he uses much previous correction. And he does this not once or
twice, although the necessity of the subject, and what he had often
said, were sufficient excuse for him. For he that remembereth sins which
God remembered not, and who therefore saith that he was unworthy of the
very name of the Apostles, even by the most insensate is seen clearly
not to be saying what he is now going to say, for the sake of glory. For
if one must say something startling, even this would be especially
injurious to his glory, his speaking something about himself; and to the
more part it is offensive. But nevertheless he regarded not timidly any
of these things, but he looked to one thing, the salvation of his
hearers. But still in order that he might not cause harm to the
unthinking by this, by saying, I mean, great things of himself, he
employs out of abundant caution these many preparatory correctives, and
says, “Would that ye could bear with me,” whilst I play the fool in some
little things, yea, rather, “ye do indeed bear with me.” Beholdest thou
wisdom? For when he says, “would that,” it is as putting it at their
disposal: but when he even asserts \[that they do\], it is as confiding
greatly in their affection, and as declaring that he both loves and is
loved. Yea, rather, not from bare love merely, but from a sort of warm
and insane passion he says that they ought to bear with him even when he
plays the fool. And therefore he added, “For I am jealous over you with
a godly jealousy <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md) .” He did not
say, ‘for I love you,’ but uses a term far more vehement than this. For
those souls are jealous which burn ardently for those they love, and
jealousy can in no other way be begotten than out of a vehement
affection. Then that they may not think, that it is for the sake of
power, or honor, or wealth, or any other such like thing, that he
desires their affection, he added, “with a jealousy of God.” For God
also is said to be jealous, not that any should suppose <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) passion, (for the Godhead is
impassible,) but that all may know that He doeth all things from no
other regard than their sakes over whom He is jealous; not that Himself
may gain aught, but that He may save them. Among men indeed jealousy
ariseth not from this cause, but for the sake of their own repose; not
because the beloved ones sustain outrage, but lest these who love them
should be wounded, and be outshone in the good graces, and stand lower
in the affections, of the beloved. But here it is not so. ‘For I care
not,’ he says, ‘for this, lest I should stand lower in your esteem; but
lest I should see you corrupted. For such is God’s jealousy; and such is
mine also, intense at once and pure.’ Then there is also this necessary
reason;

<span id="v.xxiii-p8"></span>“For I espoused you to one husband, as a
pure virgin.” ‘Therefore I am jealous, not for myself, but for him to
whom I have espoused you.’ For the present time is the time of espousal,
but the time of the nuptials is another; when they sing, ‘the Bridegroom
hath risen up.’ Oh what things unheard of!  In the world they are
virgins before the marriage, but after the marriage no longer. But here
it is not so: but even though they be not virgins before this marriage,
after the marriage they become virgins. So the whole Church is a virgin.
For addressing himself even to all, both husbands and wives, he speaks
thus. But let us see what he brought and espoused us with, what kind of
nuptial gifts. Not gold, not silver, but the kingdom of heaven.
Wherefore also he said, “We are ambassadors on behalf of Christ,” and
beseeches them, when he was about to receive the Bride. What happened in
Abraham’s case was a type of this. ([Gen. xxiv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#004)<span id="v.xxiii-p8.1"></span>, &c..md)
 For he sent his faithful servant to seek a Gentile maiden in marriage;
and in this case God sent His own servants to seek the Church in
marriage for His son, and prophets from of old saying, “Hearken, O
daughter, and consider, and forget thine own people and thy father’s
house, and the King <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span
id="v.xxiii-Page_384"></span>shall desire thy beauty.” ([Ps.
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#011)<span id="v.xxiii-p8.2"></span>..md)
Seest thou the prophet also espousing? seest thou the Apostle too
expressing the same thing himself with much boldness, and saying, “I
espoused you to one husband that I might present you as a pure virgin to
Christ?” Seest thou wisdom again? For having said, ‘Ye ought to bear
with me,’ he did not say, ‘for I am your teacher and I speak not for
mine own sake:’ but he uses this expression which invested them with
especial dignity, placing himself in the room of her who promotes a
match, and them in the rank of the bride; and he adds these words;

<span id="v.xxiii-p9"></span>[2 Cor.
11.3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p9.1"></span>.
“But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
toward Christ <span id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) .”

<span id="v.xxiii-p11"></span>‘For although the destruction be yours
\[alone\], yet is the sorrow mine as well.’ And consider his wisdom. For
he does not assert, although they were corrupted; and so he showed when
he said, “When your obedience is fulfilled,” (c. [2 Cor.
10.6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006)<span id="v.xxiii-p11.1"></span>..md)
and “I shall bewail many which have sinned already;” (c. [2 Cor.
12.21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p11.2"></span>.) but still he does not leave them to get
shameless. And therefore he says, “lest at any time.” For this neither
condemns nor is silent; for neither course were safe, whether to speak
out plainly or to conceal perpetually. Therefore he employs this middle
form, saying, “lest at any time.” For this is the language neither of
one that entirely distrusts, nor entirely relies on them, but of one who
stands between these two. In this way then he palliated, but by his
mention of that history threw them into an indescribable terror, and
cuts them off from all forgiveness. For even although the serpent was
malignant, and she senseless, yet did none of these things snatch the
woman from punishment. ‘Beware then,’ he says, ‘lest such be your fate,
and there be naught to screen you. For he too promising greater things,
so deceived.’ Whence it is plain that these <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) too, by boasting and puffing
themselves up, deceived. And this may be conjectured not from this place
only, but also from what he says afterwards,

<span id="v.xxiii-p13"></span>[2 Cor.
11.4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p13.1"></span>.
“If he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or
if ye receive a different Spirit which ye did not receive, or a
different Gospel which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with him.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p14"></span>And he does not say, ‘Lest by any means as
Adam was deceived:’ but shows that those men <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) are but women who are thus abused, for
it is the part of woman to be deceived. And he did not say, ‘so ye also
should be deceived:’ but keeping up the metaphor, he says, “so your
minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.”
‘From the simplicity, I say, not from wickedness; neither out of
wickedness \[is it\], nor out of your not believing, but out of
simplicity.’ But, nevertheless, not even under such circumstances are
the deceived entitled to forgiveness, as Eve showed. But if this does
not entitle to forgiveness, much more will it not do so, when through
vain-glory any is so <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md) .

<span id="v.xxiii-p17"></span>\[2.\] “For if he that cometh preacheth
another Jesus whom we did not preach:” showing hereby that their
deceivers were not Corinthians, but persons from some other quarter
previously corrupted: wherefore he saith, “he that cometh.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p18"></span>“If ye receive a different Spirit, if a
different Gospel which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear” with him.
What sayest thou? Thou that saidst to the Galatians, “If any preach
another Gospel to you than that ye have received, let him be anathema;”
dost thou now say, “ye do well to bear” with him? And yet on this
account it were meet not to bear with, but to recoil, from them; but if
they say the same things, it is meet to bear with them. How then dost
thou say, ‘because they say the same things, it is not meet to bear with
them?’ for he says, ‘if they said other things, it were meet to bear
with them.’ Let us then give good heed, for the danger is great, and the
precipice deep, if men run past this carelessly; and what is here said
giveth an entrance to all the heresies. What then is the sense of these
words? Those persons so boasted as if the Apostles taught incompletely,
and they were introducing somewhat more than they. For it is probable
that with much idle talk, they were bringing in senseless rubbish so as
to overlay these doctrines. And therefore he made mention of the serpent
and of Eve who was thus deceived by the expectation of acquiring more.
And alluding to this in the former Epistle also, he said, “Now ye are
become rich, ye have reigned as kings without us;” and again, “we are
fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ.” ([1 Cor.
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010)<span id="v.xxiii-p18.1"></span>..md)
Since then it was probable that using the wisdom which is without, they
talked much idly, <span id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span
id="v.xxiii-Page_385"></span>what he says is this: that ‘if these
persons said any thing more, and preached a different Christ who ought
to have been preached, but we omitted it, “ye do well to bear” with
them.’ For on this account he added, “whom we did not preach.” ‘But if
the chief points of the faith are the same, what have ye the more of
them? for whatsoever things they may say, they will say nothing more
than what we have said.’ And observe with what precision he states the
case. For he did not say, ‘if he that cometh saith any thing more;’ for
they did say something more, haranguing with more authority and with
much beauty of language; wherefore he did not say this, but what? \[If\]
“he that cometh preacheth another Jesus,” a thing which had no need of
that array of words: “or ye receive a different Spirit,” (for neither
was there need of words in this case;) that is to say, ‘makes you richer
in grace;’ or “a different Gospel which ye did not accept,” (nor did
this again stand in need of words,) “ye do well to bear” with him. But
consider, I pray thee, how he every where uses such a definition as
shows that nothing very great, nor indeed any thing more, had been
introduced by them. For when he had said, “If he that cometh preacheth
another Jesus,” he added, “whom we did not preach;” and “ye receive a
different Spirit,” he subjoined, “which ye did not receive; or a
different Gospel,” he added, “which ye did not accept,” by all these
showing that it is meet to attend to them, not simply if they say
something more, but if they said any thing more which ought to have been
said and was by us omitted. But if it ought not to have been said, and
was therefore not said by us; or if they say only the same things as we,
why gape ye so admiringly <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) upon
them?  ‘And yet if they say the same things,’ saith one, ‘wherefore dost
thou hinder them?’ Because that using hypocrisy, they introduce strange
doctrines. This however for the present he doth not say, but afterwards
asserts it, when he says, “They fashion themselves into Apostles of
Christ;” ([2 Cor. 11.13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p19.2"></span>.) for the present he withdraws the disciples
from their authority by less offensive considerations; and this not out
of envy to them, but to secure these. Else why does he not hinder
Apollos, who was, however, a “learned man, and mighty in the
Scriptures;” ([Acts 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024.md), [1 Cor.
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p19.3"></span>.) but even beseeches him, and promises he
will send him? Because together with his learning he preserved also the
integrity of the doctrines; but with these it was the reverse. And
therefore he wars with them and blames the disciples for gaping
admiringly upon them, saying, ‘if aught that should have been said we
omitted and they supplied, we do not hinder you from giving heed to
them: but if all has been fully completed by us and nothing left
deficient, whence is it that they caught you?’ Wherefore also he adds,

<span id="v.xxiii-p20"></span>[2 Cor.
11.5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p20.1"></span>.
“For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest Apostles,”
no longer making comparison of himself with them, but with Peter and the
rest. ‘So that if they know more than I do, \[they know more\] than they
also.’ And observe how here also he shows modesty. For he did not say,
‘the Apostles said nothing more than I,’ but what? “I reckon,” so I
deem, “that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest Apostles.” For
since this also appeared to bespeak an inferiority in him, that those
having preceded him were of greater name; and more respect was
entertained for them, and these persons were intending to foist
themselves in; therefore he makes this comparison of himself with them
with the dignity <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) that becomes
him. Therefore he also mentions them with encomiums, not speaking simply
of “the Apostles,” but “the very chiefest,” meaning Peter and James and
John.

<span id="v.xxiii-p22"></span>\[3.\] [2 Cor.
11.6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p22.1"></span>.
“But though I be rude in speech, yet am I not in knowledge.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p23"></span>For since those that corrupted the
Corinthians had the advantage in this, that they were not rude; he
mentions this also, showing that he was not ashamed of, but even prided
himself upon it. And he said not, “But though I be rude in speech,” yet
so also are they <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) , for this
would have seemed to be accusing them as well as himself, and exalting
these: but he overthrows the thing itself, the wisdom from without. And
indeed in his former Epistle he contends even vehemently about this
thing, saying that it not only contributes nothing to the Preaching, but
it even throws a shadow on the glory of the Cross; ([1 Cor. ii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001)<span id="v.xxiii-p24.1"></span>..md)
for he says, “I came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom unto
you, lest the cross of Christ should be made void; ([1 Cor. i.
17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017)<span id="v.xxiii-p24.2"></span>..md)
and many other things of the same kind; because “in knowledge” they were
“rude,” which is also the extremest form of rudeness. When therefore it
was necessary to institute a comparison in those things which were
great, he compares himself with the Apostles: but when to show that
which appeared to be a deficiency, he no longer does this, but grapples
with the thing itself and shows that it was a superiority. And when
indeed no necessity urged him, he says that he is “the least of the
Apostles,” and not worthy even of the title; but here again when
occasion called, he says that he is “not a whit behind the very chiefest
Apostles.” For he knew that this would most advantage the disciples.
Wherefore also he adds,

<span id="v.xxiii-p25"></span><span id="page_386">p. 386</span> <span
id="v.xxiii-Page_386"></span>“Nay, in every thing we have made it
manifest among all men to youward.” For here again he accuses the false
Apostles as “walking in craftiness.” ([2 Cor.
4.2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002)<span id="v.xxiii-p25.1"></span>..md)
And he said this of himself before also, that he did not live after the
outward appearance, nor preach “handling the word deceitfully ([2 Cor.
4.2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002)<span id="v.xxiii-p25.2"></span>.md)
and corrupting it. But those men were one thing and appeared another.
But not so he. Wherefore also he every where assumes a high tone, as
doing nothing with a view to men’s opinion nor concealing aught about
himself. As he also said before, “by the manifestation of the truth
commending ourselves to every man’s conscience,” ([2 Cor.
4.2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002)<span id="v.xxiii-p25.3"></span>.md)
so now again he saith “in every thing we have made it manifest to you.”
But what does this mean? ‘We are rude,’ he said, ‘and do not conceal it:
we receive from some persons and we do not keep it secret. We receive
then from you, and we pretend not that we do not receive, as they do
when they receive, but we make every thing that we do manifest unto
you;’ which was the conduct of one that both had exceeding confidence in
them, and told them every thing truly. Wherefore he also calls them
witnesses, saying now, “among all men to youward,” and also before, “For
we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or even
acknowledge.” ([2 Cor. 1.13](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p25.4"></span>.)

<span id="v.xxiii-p26"></span>\[4.\] Then after he had defended his own
conduct he goes on next to say with severity,

<span id="v.xxiii-p27"></span>[2 Cor.
11.7](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p27.1"></span>.
“Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted?”

<span id="v.xxiii-p28"></span>And in explanation of this, he adds,

<span id="v.xxiii-p29"></span>[2 Cor.
11.8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p29.1"></span>.
“I robbed other churches, taking wages of them that I might minister
unto you.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p30"></span>What he says is this; ‘I lived in
straitness;’ for this is the force of “abasing myself.” ‘Can you then
lay this to my charge? and do ye therefore lift up yourselves against
me, because I abased myself by begging, by enduring straits, by
suffering, by hungering, that ye might be exalted?’ And how were they
exalted by his being in straits? They were more edified and were not
offended; which also might \[well\] be a very great accusation of them
and a reproach of their weakness; that it was not possible in any other
way to lead them on than by first abasing himself. ‘Do ye then lay it to
my charge that I abased myself? But thereby ye were exalted.’ For since
he said even above that they accused him, for that when present he was
lowly, and when absent bold, in defending himself he here strikes them
again, saying, ‘this too was for your sakes.’

<span id="v.xxiii-p31"></span>“I robbed other churches.” Here finally he
speaks reproachfully, but his former words prevent these from seeming
offensive; for he said, “Bear with me in a little foolishness:” and
before all his other achievements makes this his first boast. For this
worldly men look to especially, and on this also those his adversaries
greatly prided themselves. Therefore it is that he does not first enter
on the subject of his perils, nor yet of his miracles, but on this of
his contempt of money, because they prided themselves on this; and at
the same time he also hints that they were wealthy. But what is to be
admired in him is this, that when he was able to say that he was even
supported by his own hands, he did not say this; but says that which
especially shamed them and yet was no encomium on himself, namely, ‘I
took from others.’ And he did not say “took,” but “robbed,” that is, ‘I
stripped them, and made them poor.’ And what surely is greater, that it
was not for superfluities, but for his necessities, for when he says
‘wages,’ he means necessary subsistence. And what is more grievous yet,
“to minister unto you.” We preach to you; and when I ought to be
supported by you, I have enjoyed this at others’ hands. The accusation
is twofold, or rather three-fold; that when both living amongst them and
ministering to them, and seeking necessary support, he had others
supplying his wants. Great the excess, of the one negligence, of the
other in zeal!  For these sent to him even when at a great distance, and
those did not even support him when amongst them.

<span id="v.xxiii-p32"></span>\[5.\] Then because he had vehemently
scourged them, he quietly again relaxes the vehemence of his rebuke,
saying,

<span id="v.xxiii-p33"></span>[2 Cor.
11.9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p33.1"></span>.
“And when I was present with you, and was in want, I was not a burden on
any man.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p34"></span>For he did not say, ‘ye did not give to
me,’ but, ‘I did not take,’ for as yet he spares them. But nevertheless
even in the subduedness of his language he covertly strikes them again,
for the word, “present,” is exceedingly emphatic, and so is “in want.”
For that they might not say, ‘what matter then, if you had \[enough\]?’
he added, “and was in want.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p35"></span>“I was not a burden” on you. Here again he
hits them gently, as making such contributions reluctantly, as feeling
them a burden. Then comes the reason also, full of accusation and
fraught with jealousy. Wherefore also he introduced it, not in the way
of a leading point <span id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) , but as
informing them whence and by whom he was supported, so as to stimulate
them again, in an unsuspicious way, as to the point of almsgiving;

<span id="v.xxiii-p37"></span>“For the measure of my want,” he says,
“the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied.” Seest thou how he
provokes them again, by bringing forward those that had ministered to
him? For inspiring them first <span id="page_387">p. 387</span> <span
id="v.xxiii-Page_387"></span>with a desire of knowing who these could
be, when he said, “I robbed other churches;” he then mentions them also
by name; which would incite them also unto almsgiving. For he thus
persuades those who had been beaten \[by them\] in the matter of
supporting the Apostle, not to be also beaten in the succor they gave to
the poor. And he says this also in his Epistle to the Macedonians
themselves, “For in my necessities ye sent unto me once and again, even
in the beginning of the Gospel;” ([Phil.
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015)<span id="v.xxiii-p37.1"></span>..md)
which point also was a very great commendation of them, that from the
very beginning they shone forth. But observe how everywhere he mentions
his “necessity,” and no where a superfluity. Now therefore by saying
“present,” and in “want” he showed that he ought to have been supported
by the Corinthians; and by the words, “they supplied the measure of my
want,” he shows that he did not so much as ask. And he assigns a reason
which was not the real one. What then is this? That he had received from
others; “for,” says he, “the measure of my want those that came
supplied.” ‘For this reason,’ he says, ‘I was not a burden; not because
I had no confidence in you.’ And yet it is for this latter reason that
he so acts, and he shows it in what follows; but does not say it
plainly, but throws it into the shade <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) , leaving it to the conscience of his
hearers. And he gives proof of it covertly in what follows, by saying,

<span id="v.xxiii-p39"></span>“And in every” thing “I kept myself from
being burdensome, and so will I keep” myself. “For think not,” says he,
“that I say these things that I may receive.” Now the words “so will I
keep myself,” are severer, if he has not even yet confidence in them;
but once for all had given up the idea of receiving aught from them. He
shows, moreover, that they even considered this to be a burden;
wherefore he said, “I have kept myself from being burdensome, and so
will I keep myself.” He says this in his former Epistle also, “I write
not this that it may be so done unto me; for” it were “good for me
rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.” ([1 Cor.
ix. 15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p39.1"></span>.) And here again, “I have kept myself from
being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep” myself.

<span id="v.xxiii-p40"></span>\[6.\] Then, that he may not seem to speak
these things for the sake of winning them on the better \[to do this\],
he saith,

<span id="v.xxiii-p41"></span>[2 Cor.
11.10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p41.1"></span>.
“As the truth of Christ is in me.” ‘Do not think that I therefore have
spoken, that I may receive, that I may the rather draw you on: for,’
saith he, “as the truth is in me,

<span id="v.xxiii-p42"></span>“No man shall stop me of this glorying in
the regions of Achaia.” For that none should think again that he is
grieved at this, or that he speaks these things in anger, he even calls
the thing a “glorying.” And in his former Epistle too he dressed it
out <span id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) in like terms. For so that
he may not wound them there either, he says, “What then is my reward?”
“That when I preach the Gospel, I may make the Gospel of Christ without
charge.” ([1 Cor. ix. 18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p43.2"></span>.) And as he there calls it “reward,” so doth
he here “glorying,” that they may not be excessively ashamed at what he
said, as if he were asking and they gave not to him. ‘For, what, if even
ye would give?’ saith he, ‘Yet I do not accept it.’ And the expression,
“shall not stop me,” is a metaphor taken from rivers, or from the
report, as if running every where, of his receiving nothing. ‘Ye stop
not with your giving this my freedom of speech.’ But he said not, ‘ye
stop not,’ which would have been too <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md) cutting, but it “no man shall stop me
in the regions of Achaia.” This again was like giving them a fatal blow,
and exceedingly apt to deject and pain them, since they were the only
persons he refused \[to take from\]. ‘For if he made that his boast, it
were meet to make it so every where: but if he only does so among us,
perchance this is owing to our weakness.’ Lest therefore they should so
reason and be dejected, see how he corrects this.

<span id="v.xxiii-p45"></span>[2 Cor.
11.11](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#011.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p45.1"></span>.
“Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p46"></span>Quickly \[is it done\], and by an easy
method <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md) . But still, not even so
did he rid them of those charges. For he neither said, ‘ye are not
weak,’ nor yet, ‘ye are strong;’ but, “I love you,” which very greatly
aggravated the accusation against them. For the not receiving from them,
because they felt it an exceeding grievance, was a proof of special love
toward them. So he acted in two contrary ways out of love; he both did
receive, and did not receive: but this contrariety was on account of the
disposition of the givers. And he did not say, ‘I therefore do not take
of you, because I exceedingly love you,’ for this would have contained
an accusation of their weakness and have thrown them into distress; but
he turned what he said to another reason. What then is this?

<span id="v.xxiii-p48"></span>[2 Cor.
11.12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p48.1"></span>.
“That I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that
wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.”

<span id="v.xxiii-p49"></span>For since this they sought earnestly, to
find some handle <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) against him, it
is necessary to remove this also. For this is the one point on which
they pique themselves. Therefore that <span id="page_388">p. 388</span>
<span id="v.xxiii-Page_388"></span>they might not have any advantage
whatever, it was necessary to set this right; for in other things they
were inferior. For, as I have said, nothing doth so edify worldly people
as the receiving nothing from them. Therefore the devil in his
craftiness dropped this bait especially, when desirous to injure them in
other respects. But it appears to me that this even was in hypocrisy.
And therefore he did not say, ‘wherein they have well done,’ but what?
“wherein they glory;” which also was as jeering at their glorying; for
they gloried also of that which they were not. But the man of noble
spirit not only ought not to boast of what he has not, but not even of
what he possesses; as this blessed saint was wont to do, as the
patriarch Abraham did, saying, “But I am earth and ashes.” ([Gen. xviii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#027)<span id="v.xxiii-p50.2"></span>..md)
For since he had no sins to speak of, but shone with good works; having
run about in every direction and found no very great handle against
himself, he betakes himself to his nature; and since the name of “earth”
is in some way or other one of dignity, he added to it that of “ashes.”
Wherefore also another saith, “Why is earth and ashes proud?”
([Ecclesiasticus 10.9](../../../bib/apo/sir010.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p50.3"></span>.)

<span id="v.xxiii-p51"></span>\[7.\] For tell me not of the bloom of the
countenance, nor of the uplifted neck, nor of the mantle, and the horse,
and the followers; but reflect where all these things do end, and put
that to them. But and if thou tell me of what appears to the eye, I too
will tell thee of things in pictures, brighter far than these.  But as
we do not admire those for their appearance, as seeing what their nature
is, that all is clay; so therefore let us not these either, for these
too are but clay. Yea rather, even before they are dissolved and become
dust, show me this uplifted \[neck\] a prey to fever and gasping out
life; and then will I discourse with thee and will ask, What has become
of all that profuse ornament? whither has that crowd of flatterers
vanished, that attendance of slaves, that abundance of wealth and
possessions? What wind hath visited and blown all away? Nay, even
stretched upon the bier, he beareth the tokens of that wealth and that
pride; a splendid garment thrown over him, poor and rich following him
forth, the assembled crowds breathing words of good omen <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930.md) . Surely this also is a very mockery;
howbeit even this besides is presently proved naught, like a blossom
that perishes. For when we have passed over the threshold of the city
gates, and after having delivered over the body to the worms, return, I
will ask thee again, where is that vast crowd gone to? What has become
of the clamor and uproar? where are the torches? where the bands of
women? are not these things, then, a dream? And what too has become of
the shouts? where are those many lips that cried, and bade him ‘be of
good cheer, for no man is immortal?’ These things ought not now to be
said to one that heareth not, but when he made prey of others, when he
was overreaching, then with a slight change should it have been said to
him, ‘Be not of good cheer, no man is immortal; hold in thy madness,
extinguish thy lust;’ but ‘Be of good cheer’ is for the injured party.
For to chant such things over this man now, is but like men exulting
over him and speaking irony; for he ought not for this now to be of good
cheer, but to fear and tremble.

<span id="v.xxiii-p53"></span>And if even this advice is now of no use
to him since he has run his course, yet at least let those of the rich
who labor under the same disease, and follow him to the tomb, hear it.
For although beforehand through the intoxication of wealth, they have no
such thing in mind, yet at that season when the sight of him that is
laid out even confirms what is said, let them be sober, let them be
instructed: reflecting that yet a little while and they will come that
shall bear them away to that fearful account, and to suffer the penalty
of their acts of rapacity and extortion. ‘And what is this to the poor?’
saith one. Why, to many this also is a satisfaction, to see him that
hath wronged them punished. ‘But to us it is no satisfaction, but the
escaping suffering ourselves.’ I praise you exceedingly and approve of
you in that ye exult not over the calamities of others, but seek only
your own safety. Come then, I will ensure <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931.md) you this also. For if we suffer evil
at the hands of men, we cut off no small part of our debt by bearing
what is done to us nobly. We receive therefore no injury; for God
reckons the ill-treatment towards our debt, not according to the
principle of justice but of His loving-kindness; and because He succored
not him that suffered evil. ‘Whence doth this appear?’ saith one. The
Jews once suffered evil at the hand of the Babylonians; and God did not
prevent it: but they were carried away, children and women; yet
afterwards did this captivity become a consolation to them in respect
of <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932.md) their sins. Therefore He
saith to Isaiah, “Comfort ye, comfort ye My people, ye priests: speak
unto the heart of Jerusalem, for she hath received of the Lord’s hand
double for sins.” ([Isa. 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002)<span id="v.xxiii-p55.2"></span>..md)
And again; “Grant us peace, for Thou hast repaid us every thing.” ([Is.
26.12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p55.3"></span>,
LXX.) And David saith; “Behold mine enemies, for they are multiplied;
and forgive all my sins.” ([Ps. 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#019.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#018)<span id="v.xxiii-p55.4"></span>..md)
And when he bore with Shimei cursing him, he said, “Let him alone, that
the Lord may see my abasement, and requite me good for this day.” ([2
Sam. 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p55.5"></span><span id="page_389">p. 389</span> <span
id="v.xxiii-Page_389"></span>.) For when He aideth us not when we suffer
wrong, then most of all are we advantaged; for He sets it to the account
of our sins, if we bear it thankfully.

<span id="v.xxiii-p56"></span>\[8.\] So that when thou seest a rich man
plundering a poor, leave him that suffereth wrong, and weep for the
plunderer. For the one putteth off filth, the other bedaubeth himself
with more filth. Such was the fate of Elisha’s servant in the story of
Naaman ([2 Kings v. 20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p56.1"></span>, &c.)  For though he took not by violence,
yet he did a wrong; for to get money by deceit is a wrong. What then
befel? With the wrong he received also the leprosy; and he that was
wronged was benefited, but he that did the wrong received the greatest
possible harm. The same happens now also in the case of the soul. And
this is of so great force that often by itself it hath propitiated God;
yea though he who suffereth evil be unworthy of aid; yet when he so
suffers in excess, by this alone he draweth God unto the forgiveness of
himself, and to the punishment of him that did the wrong. Wherefore also
God said of old to the heathen, “I indeed delivered them over unto a few
things, but they have set themselves on together unto evil things;”
([Zech. i. 15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p56.2"></span>. LXX.) they shall suffer ills
irremediable <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933.md) . For there is
nothing, no, nothing, that doth so much exasperate God as rapine and
violence and extortion. And why forsooth? Because it is very easy to
abstain from this sin. For here it is not any natural desire that
perturbeth the mind, but it ariseth from wilful negligence <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934.md) . How then doth the Apostle call it,
“a root of evils.” ([1 Tim. vi.
10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010)<span id="v.xxiii-p58.3"></span>..md)
Why, I say so too, but this root is from us, and not from the nature of
the things. And, if ye will, let us make a comparison and see which is
the more imperious, the desire of money or of beauty <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935.md) ; for that which shall be found to
have struck down great men is the more difficult to master. Let us see
then what great man the desire of money ever got possession of. Not one;
only of exceeding pitiful and abject persons, Gehazi, Ahab, Judas, the
priests of the Jews: but the desire for beauty overcame even the great
prophet David. And this I say, not as extending forgiveness to those who
are conquered by such a lust, but rather, as preparing them to be
watchful. For when I have shown the strength of the passion, then, most
especially, I show them to be deprived of every claim to forgiveness.
For if indeed thou hadst not known the wild beast, thou wouldest have
this to take refuge in; but now, having known, yet falling into it, thou
wilt have no excuse. After him <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936.md) ,
it took possession of his son still more completely. And yet there was
never man wiser than he, and all other virtue did he attain; still,
however, he was seized so violently by this passion, that even in his
vitals he received the wound. And the father indeed rose up again and
renewed the struggle, and was crowned again; but the son showed nothing
of the kind.

<span id="v.xxiii-p61"></span>Therefore also Paul said, “It is better to
marry than to burn:” ([1 Cor. vii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#009)<span id="v.xxiii-p61.1"></span>..md)
and Christ, “He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” ([Matt.
xiv. 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p61.2"></span>.) But concerning money He spake not so, but,
“whoso hath forsaken” his goods “shall receive an hundredfold.” ([Matt.
14.29](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#029.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p61.3"></span>.) ‘How then,’ saith one, ‘did He say of the
rich, that they shall hardly obtain the kingdom?’ Again implying their
weakness of character; not the imperiousness of money, but their utter
slavery. And this is evident also from the advice which Paul gave. For
from that lust he leads men quite away, saying, “But they that desire to
be rich fall into temptation;” ([1 Tim. vi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009)<span id="v.xxiii-p61.4"></span>..md)
but in the case of the other not so; but having separated them “for a
season” only, and that by “consent,” he advises to ‘come together again’
([1 Cor. vii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p61.5"></span>.) For he feared the billows of lust lest they
should occasion a grievous shipwreck. This passion is even more
vehement <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md) than anger. For it is
not possible to feel anger when there is nothing <span
id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md) proving it, but a man cannot help
desiring even when the face which moveth to it is not seen. Therefore
this passion indeed He did not cut off altogether, but added the words,
“without a cause.” ([Matt. v. 22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p63.1"></span>.) Nor again did He abolish all desire, but
only that which is unlawful, for he saith, “Nevertheless, because of
desires <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md) , let every man have his
own wife.” ([1 Cor. vii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p64.3"></span>.) But to lay up treasure He allowed not,
either with cause or without. For those passions were implanted in our
nature for a necessary end; desire, for the procreation of children, and
anger, for the succor of the injured, but desire of money not so.
Therefore neither is the passion natural to us. So then if thou art made
captive by it, thou wilt suffer so much the more the vilest punishment.
Therefore surely, it is, that Paul, permitting even a second marriage,
demands in the case of money great strictness, saying, “Why not rather
take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?” ([1 Cor. vi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007)<span id="v.xxiii-p64.4"></span>..md)
And when treating of virginity, he says, “I have no commandment,” ([1
Cor. 7.25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p64.5"></span>.) and “I speak this for your profit, not that
I may cast a snare upon you;” ([1 Cor.
7.35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035)<span id="v.xxiii-p64.6"></span>..md)
but when his discourse is of money, he says, “Having raiment and <span
id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span id="v.xxiii-Page_390"></span>food, let
us be therewith content.” ([1 Tim. vi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008)<span id="v.xxiii-p64.7"></span>..md)
‘How then is it,’ saith one, ‘that by this, more than the other, are
many overcome?’ Because they stand not so much on their guard <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md) against it as against lasciviousness
and fornication; for if they had thought it equally dangerous, they
would not, perhaps, have been made its captives. So also were those
wretched virgins cast out of the bridechamber, because that, having
struck down the great adversary, they were wounded <span
id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md) by one weaker, and who was nothing.
([Matt. xxv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.xxiii-p66.1"></span>, &c.) Besides this, one may say further, that
if any, subduing lust, is overcome by money, often <span
id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md) he does not in fact subdue lust, but
has received from nature the gift of suffering no great uneasiness of
that sort; for all are not equally inclined to it. Knowing then these
things, and revolving frequently with ourselves the example of the
virgins, let us shun this evil wild beast. For if virginity profited
them nothing, but after countless toils and labors they perished through
the love of money, who shall deliver us if we fall into this passion? 
Wherefore I beseech you to do all you can, both that ye be not taken
captive by it, and that if taken, ye continue not in captivity, but
break asunder those hard bonds. For so shall we be able to secure a
footing in heaven and to obtain the countless good things; whereunto may
all we attain, through the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with Whom to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might,
honor, now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.

wisdom in matters pertaining to Christianity.” The allusion to the
marriage relation in the previous verse is still kept up. The Apostle’s
fear was that the Corinthians might be so corrupted as to turn away from
the undivided affection and devotion which they owed to the Lord Jesus
Christ as much as a bride to her husband. His warning is confirmed by
his reference to the one standing example of the inconstancy of the
human heart, and of the fearful consequences of forsaking God. In his
mind the narrative of the fall was neither a fable nor an allegory, but
an historical fact. C.\]
