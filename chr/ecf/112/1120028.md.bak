<span id="iv.xxv"></span>

<span id="iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Homily XXIV.</span>

<span id="iv.xxv-p2"></span><span id="iv.xxv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xxv-p2.2"></span>[1 Cor. x.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.xxv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xxv-p3"></span>There hath no temptation taken you, but such
as man can bear: but God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also
the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.

<span id="iv.xxv-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iv.xxv-p4.1"></span>Thus</span>, because he terrified them greatly,
relating the ancient examples, and threw them into an agony, saying,
“Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall; “though they
had borne many temptations, and had exercised themselves many times
therein; for “I was with you,” saith he, “in weakness, and in fear, and
in much trembling:” ([1 Cor. ii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003)<span id="iv.xxv-p4.2"></span>..md) lest
they should say, “Why terrify and alarm us? we are not unexercised in
these troubles, for we have been both driven and persecuted, and many
and continual dangers have we endured:” repressing again their pride, he
says, “there hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear,”
i.e., small, brief, moderate. For he uses the expression “man can
bear <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) ,” in respect of what is
small; as when he says, “I speak after the manner of men because of the
infirmity of your flesh.” ([Rom. vi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019)<span id="iv.xxv-p5.3"></span>..md)
“Think not then great things,” saith he, “as though ye had overcome the
storm. For never have ye seen a danger threatening death nor a
temptation intending slaughter:” which also he said to the Hebrews, “ye
have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.” ([Heb. xii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004)<span id="iv.xxv-p5.4"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxv-p6"></span>Then, because he terrified them, see how
again he raises them up, at the same time recommending moderation; in
the words, “God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above
that ye are able.” There are therefore temptations which we are not able
to bear. And what are these? All, so to speak. For the ability lies in
God’s gracious influence; a power which we draw down by our own will.
Wherefore that thou mayest know and see that not only those which exceed
our power, but not even these which are “common to man” is it possible
without assistance from God easily to bear, he added,

<span id="iv.xxv-p7"></span>“But will with the temptation also make the
way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p8"></span>For, saith he, not even those moderate
temptations, as I was remarking, may we bear by our <span
id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span id="iv.xxv-Page_139"></span>own power:
but even in them we require aid from Him in our warfare that we may pass
through them, and until we have passed, bear them. For He gives patience
and brings on a speedy release; so that in this way also the temptation
becomes bearable. This he covertly intimates, saying, “will also make
the way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it:” and all things he
refers to Him.

<span id="iv.xxv-p9"></span>\[2.\] [1 Cor.
10.14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p9.1"></span>.
“Wherefore, my brethren <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) , flee
from idolatry.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p11"></span>Again he courts them by the name of
kindred, and urges them to be rid of this sin with all speed. For he did
not say, simply, depart, but “flee;” and he calls the matter “idolatry,”
and no longer bids them quit it merely on account of the injury to their
neighbor, but signifies that the very thing of itself is sufficient to
bring a great destruction.

<span id="iv.xxv-p12"></span>[1 Cor.
10.15](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p12.1"></span>.
“I speak as to wise men: judge ye what I say.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p13"></span>Because he hath cried out aloud and
heightened the accusation, calling it idolatry; that he might not seem
to exasperate them and to make his speech disgusting, in what follows he
refers the decision to them, and sets his judges down on their tribunal
with an encomium. “For I speak as to wise men,” saith he: which is the
mark of one very confident of his own rights, that he should make the
accused himself the judge of his allegations.

<span id="iv.xxv-p14"></span>Thus also he more elevates the hearer, when
he discourses not as commanding nor as laying down the law, but as
advising with them and as actually pleading before them. For with the
Jews, as more foolishly and childishly disposed, God did not so
discourse, nor did He in every instance acquaint them with the reasons
of the commands, but merely enjoined them; but here, because we have the
privilege of great liberty, we are even admitted to be counsellors. And
he discourses as with friends, and says, “I need no other judges, do ye
yourselves pass this sentence upon me, I take you for arbiters.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p15"></span>\[3.\] [1 Cor.
10.16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p15.1"></span>.
“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the Blood
of Christ?”

<span id="iv.xxv-p16"></span>What sayest thou, O blessed Paul? When thou
wouldest appeal to the hearer’s reverence, when thou art making mention
of awful mysteries, dost thou give the title of “cup of blessing” to
that fearful and most tremendous cup? “Yea,” saith he; “and no mean
title is that which was spoken. For when I call it ‘blessing,’ I mean
thanksgiving, and when I call it thanksgiving I unfold all the treasure
of God’s goodness, and call to mind those mighty gifts.” Since we too,
recounting over the cup the unspeakable mercies of God and all that we
have been made partakers of, so draw near to Him, and communicate;
giving Him thanks that He hath delivered from error the whole race of
mankind <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) ; that being afar off,
He made them nigh; that when they had no hope and were without God in
the world, He constituted them His own brethren and fellow-heirs. For
these and all such things, giving thanks, thus we approach. “How then
are not your doings inconsistent,” saith he, “O ye Corinthians; blessing
God for delivering you from idols, yet running again to their tables?”

<span id="iv.xxv-p18"></span>“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it
not a communion of the Blood of Christ?” Very persuasively spake he, and
awfully. For what he says is this: “This which is in the cup is that
which flowed from His side, and of that do we partake.” But he called it
a cup of blessing, because holding it in our hands, we so exalt Him in
our hymn, wondering, astonished at His unspeakable gift, blessing Him,
among other things, for the pouring out of this self-same draught that
we might not abide in error: and not only for the pouring it out, but
also for the imparting thereof to us all. “Wherefore if thou desire
blood,” saith He, “redden not the altar of idols with the slaughter of
brute beasts, but My altar with My blood.” Tell me, What can be more
tremendous than this? What more tenderly kind? This also lovers do. When
they see those whom they love desiring what belongs to strangers and
despising their own, they give what belongs to themselves, and so
persuade them to withdraw themselves from the gifts of those others.
Lovers, however, display this liberality in goods and money and
garments, but in blood none ever did so. Whereas Christ even herein
exhibited His care and fervent love for us. And in the old covenant,
because they were in an imperfect state, the blood which they used to
offer to idols He Himself submitted to receive, that He might separate
them from those idols; which very thing again was a proof of His
unspeakable affection: but here He transferred the service to that which
is far more awful and glorious, changing the very sacrifice itself, and
instead of the slaughter of irrational creatures, commanding to offer up
Himself.

<span id="iv.xxv-p19"></span>\[4.\] “The bread which we break, is it not
a communion of the Body of Christ?” Wherefore said he not, the
participation? Because he intended to express something more and to
<span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="iv.xxv-Page_140"></span>point out how close was the union: in that
we communicate not only by participating and partaking, but also by
being united. For as that body is united to Christ, so also are we
united to him by this bread.

<span id="iv.xxv-p20"></span>But why adds he also, “which we break?” For
although in the Eucharist one may see this done, yet on the cross not
so, but the very contrary. For, “A bone of Him,” saith one, “shall not
be broken.” But that which He suffered not on the cross, this He suffers
in the oblation for thy sake, and submits to be broken, that he may fill
all men.

<span id="iv.xxv-p21"></span>Further, because he said, “a communion of
the Body,” and that which communicates is another thing from that
whereof it communicates; even this which seemeth to be but a small
difference, he took away. For having said, “a communion of the Body,” he
sought again to express something nearer. Wherefore also he added,

<span id="iv.xxv-p22"></span>[1 Cor.
10.17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p22.1"></span>.
“For we, who are many, are one bread, one body.” “For why speak I of
communion?” saith he, “we are that self-same body.” For what is the
bread? The Body of Christ. And what do they become who partake of it?
The Body of Christ: not many bodies, but one body. For as the bread
consisting of many grains is made one, so that the grains no where
appear; they exist indeed, but their difference is not seen by reason of
their conjunction; so are we conjoined both with each other and with
Christ: there not being one body for thee, and another for thy neighbor
to be nourished by, but the very same for all. Wherefore also he adds,

<span id="iv.xxv-p23"></span>“For we all partake of the one bread.” Now
if we are all nourished of the same and all become the same, why do we
not also show forth the same love, and become also in this respect one?
For this was the old way too in the time of our forefathers: “for the
multitude of them that believed,” saith the text, “were of one heart and
soul.” ([Acts iv. 32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.xxv-p23.1"></span>.) Not so, however, now, but altogether the
reverse. Many and various are the contests betwixt all, and worse than
wild beasts are we affected towards each other’s members. And Christ
indeed made thee so far remote, one with himself: but thou dost not
deign to be united even to thy brother with due exactness, but
separatest thyself, having had the privilege of so great love and life
from the Lord. For he gave not simply even His own body; but because the
former nature of the flesh which was framed out of earth, had first
become deadened by sin and destitute of life; He brought in, as one may
say, another sort of dough and leaven, His own flesh, by nature indeed
the same, but free from sin and full of life; and gave to all to partake
thereof, that being nourished by this and laying aside the old dead
material, we might be blended together unto that which is living and
eternal, by means of this table.

<span id="iv.xxv-p24"></span>\[5.\] [1 Cor.
10.18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p24.1"></span>.
“Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they which eat the sacrifices
communion with the altar?”

<span id="iv.xxv-p25"></span>Again, from the old covenant he leads them
unto this point also. For because they were far beneath the greatness of
the things which had been spoken, he persuades them both from former
things and from those to which they were accustomed. And he says well,
“according to the flesh,” as though they themselves were according to
the Spirit. And what he says is of this nature: “even from persons of
the grosser sort ye may be instructed that they who eat the sacrifices,
have communion with the altar.” Dost thou see how he intimates that they
who seemed to be perfect have not perfect knowledge, if they know not
even this, that the result of these sacrifices to many oftentimes is a
certain communion and friendship with devils, the practice drawing them
on by degrees? For if among men the fellowship of salt <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) and the table becomes an occasion and
token of friendship, it is possible that this may happen also in the
case of devils.

<span id="iv.xxv-p27"></span>But do thou, I pray, consider, how with
regard to the Jews he said not, “they are par-takers with God,” but,
“they have communion with the altar;” for what was placed thereon was
burnt: but in respect to the Body of Christ, not so. But how? It is “a
Communion of the Lord’s Body.” For not with the altar, but with Christ
Himself, do we have communion.

<span id="iv.xxv-p28"></span>But having said that they have “communion
with the altar,” afterwards fearing lest he should seem to discourse as
if the idols had any power and could do some injury, see again how he
overthrows them, saying,

<span id="iv.xxv-p29"></span>[1 Cor.
10.19](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p29.1"></span>.
“What say I then? That an idol is any thing? or that a thing sacrificed
to idols is any thing?”

<span id="iv.xxv-p30"></span>As if he had said, “Now these things I
affirm, and try to withdraw you from the idols, not as though they could
do any injury or had any power: for an idol is nothing; but I wish you
to despise them.” “And if thou wilt have us despise them,” saith one,
“wherefore dost thou carefully withdraw us from them?” Because they are
not offered to thy Lord.

<span id="iv.xxv-p31"></span>[1 Cor.
10.20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.xxv-p31.1"></span>. <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)  
“For that which the Gentiles sacrifice,” saith he, “they sacrifice to
demons, and not to God.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p33"></span><span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span
id="iv.xxv-Page_141"></span>Do not then run to the contrary things. For
neither if thou wert a king’s son, and having the privilege of thy
father’s table, shouldest leave it and choose to partake of the table of
the condemned and the prisoners in the dungeon, would thy father permit
it, but with great vehemence he would withdraw thee; not as though the
table could harm thee, but because it disgraces thy nobility and the
royal table. For verily these too are servants who have offended;
dishonored, condemned, prisoners reserved for intolerable punishment,
accountable for ten thousand crimes. How then art thou not ashamed to
imitate the gluttonous and vulgar crew, in that when these condemned
persons set out a table, thou runnest thither and partakest of the
viands? Here is the cause why I seek to withdraw thee. For the intention
of the sacrificers, and the person of the receivers, maketh the things
set before thee unclean.

<span id="iv.xxv-p34"></span>“And I would not that ye should have
communion with demon.” Perceivest thou the kindness of a careful father?
Perceivest thou also the very word, what force it hath to express his
feeling? “For it is my wish,” saith he, “that you have nothing in common
with them.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p35"></span>\[6.\] Next, because he brought in the
saying by way of exhortation, lest any of the grosser sort should make
light of it as having license, because he said, “I would not,” and,
“judge ye;” he positively affirms in what follows and lays down the law,
saying,

<span id="iv.xxv-p36"></span>[1 Cor.
10.21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p36.1"></span>.
“Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot
partake of the Lord’s table, and of the table of demons.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p37"></span>And he contents himself with the mere
terms, for the purpose of keeping them away.  Then, speaking also to
their sense of shame,

<span id="iv.xxv-p38"></span>[1 Cor.
10.22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p38.1"></span>.
“Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) are we stronger than He?” i.e., “Are
we tempting Him, whether He is able to punish us, and irritating Him by
going over to the adversaries and taking our stand with His enemies?”
And this he said, reminding them of an ancient history and of their
fathers’ transgression. Wherefore also he makes use of this expression,
which Moses likewise of old used against the Jews, accusing them of
idolatry in the person of God. “For they,” saith He, “moved Me to
jealousy <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) with that which is not
God; they provoked Me to anger with their idols.” ([Deut. xxxii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021)<span id="iv.xxv-p40.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxv-p41"></span>“Are we stronger than He?” Dost thou see
how terribly, how awfully he rebukes them, thoroughly shaking their very
nerves, and by his way of reducing them to an absurdity, touching them
to the quick and bringing down their pride?  “Well, but why,” some one
will say, “did he not set down these things at first, which would be
most effectual to withdraw them?” Because it is his custom to prove his
point by many particulars, and to place the strongest last, and to
prevail by proving more than was necessary. On this account then, he
began from the lesser topics, and so made his way to that which is the
sum of all evils: since thus that last point also became more easily
admitted, their mind having been smoothed down by the things said
before.

<span id="iv.xxv-p42"></span>[1 Cor.
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p42.1"></span>.
“All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all
things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. Let no man seek his
own, but each his neighbor’s good.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p43"></span>Seest thou his exact wisdom? Because it was
likely that they might say, “I am perfect and master of myself, and it
does me no harm to partake of what is set before me;” “Even so,” saith
he, “perfect thou art and master of thyself; do not however look to
this, but whether the result involve not injury, nay subversion.” For
both these he mentioned, saying, “All things are not expedient, all
things edify not;” and using the former with reference to one’s self,
the latter, to one’s brother: since the clause, “are not expedient,” is
a covert intimation of the ruin of the person to whom he speaks; but the
clause, “edify not,” of the stumbling block to the brother.

<span id="iv.xxv-p44"></span>Wherefore also he adds, “Let no man seek
his own;” which he every where through the whole Epistle insists upon
and in that to the Romans; when he says, “For even Christ pleased not
Himself:” ([Rom. xv. 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.xxv-p44.1"></span>.) and again, “Even as I please all men in all
things, not seeking mine own profit.” ([1 Cor. x.
33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033)<span id="iv.xxv-p44.2"></span>..md)
And again in this place; he does not, however, fully work it out here.
That is, since in what had gone before he had established it at length,
and shown that he no where “seeks his own,” but both “to the Jews became
as a Jew and to them that are without law as without law,” and used not
his own “liberty” and “right” at random, but to the profit of all,
serving all; he here broke off, content with a few words, by these few
guiding them to the remembrance of all which had been said.

<span id="iv.xxv-p45"></span>\[7.\] These things therefore knowing, let
us also, beloved, consult for the good of the brethren and preserve
unity with them. For to this that fearful and tremendous sacrifice leads
us, warning us above all things to approach it with one mind and fervent
love, and thereby becoming eagles, so to mount up to the very heaven,
nay, even beyond the heaven. “For wheresoever the carcase is,” saith He,
“there also will be the eagles,” (St. [Matt. xxiv.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028)<span id="iv.xxv-p45.1"></span>..md)
calling His <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="iv.xxv-Page_142"></span>body a carcase by reason of His death. For
unless He had fallen, we should not have risen again. But He calls us
eagles, implying that he who draws nigh to this Body must be on high and
have nothing common with the earth, nor wind himself downwards and creep
along; but must ever be soaring heavenwards, and look on the Sun of
Righteousness, and have the eye of his mind quick-sighted. For eagles,
not daws, have a right to this table. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md)   Those also shall then meet Him
descending from heaven, who now worthily have this privilege, even as
they who do so unworthily, shall suffer the extremest torments.

<span id="iv.xxv-p49"></span>For if one would not inconsiderately
receive a king—(why say I a king? nay were it but a royal robe, one
would not inconsiderately touch it with unclean hands;)—though he should
be in solitude, though alone, though no man were at hand:  and yet the
robe is nought but certain threads spun by worms: and if thou admirest
the dye, this too is the blood of a dead fish; nevertheless, one would
not choose to venture on it with polluted hands: I say now, if even a
man’s garment be what one would not venture inconsiderately to touch,
what shall we say of the Body of Him Who is God over all, spotless,
pure, associate with the Divine Nature, the Body whereby we are, and
live; whereby the gates of hell were broken down and the
sanctuaries <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) of heaven opened?
how shall we receive this with so great insolence? Let us not, I pray
you, let us not slay ourselves by our irreverence, but with all
awfulness and purity draw nigh to It; and when thou seest It set before
thee, say thou to thyself, “Because of this Body am I no longer earth
and ashes, no longer a prisoner, but free: because of this I hope for
heaven, and to receive the good things therein, immortal life, the
portion of angels, converse with Christ; this Body, nailed and scourged,
was more than death could stand against; this Body the very sun saw
sacrificed, and turned aside his beams; for this both the veil was rent
in that moment, and rocks were burst asunder, and all the earth was
shaken. This is even that Body, the blood-stained, the pierced, and that
out of which gushed the saving fountains, the one of blood, the other of
water, for all the world.”

<span id="iv.xxv-p51"></span>Wouldest thou from another source also
learn its power? Ask of her diseased with an issue of blood, who laid
hold not of Itself, but of the garment with which It was clad; nay not
of the whole of this, but of the hem: ask of the sea, which bare It on
its back: ask even of the Devil himself, and say, “Whence hast thou that
incurable stroke? whence hast thou no longer any power? Whence art thou
captive? By whom hast thou been seized in thy flight?” And he will give
no other answer than this, “The Body that was crucified.” By this were
his goads broken in pieces; by this was his head crushed; by this were
the powers and the principalities made a show of. “For,” saith he,
“having put off from himself principalities and powers, He made a show
of them openly, triumphing over them in it.” ([Col. ii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015)<span id="iv.xxv-p51.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxv-p52"></span>Ask also Death, and say, “whence is it that
thy sting hath been taken away? thy victory abolished? thy sinews cut
out? and thou become the laughing-stock of girls and children, who wast
before a terror even to kings and to all righteous men?” And he will
ascribe it to this Body. For when this was crucified, then were the dead
raised up, then was that prison burst, and the gates of brass were
broken, and the dead were loosed, <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) and the keepers of hell-gate all
cowered in fear. And yet, had He been one of the many, death on the
contrary should have become more mighty; but it was not so. For He was
not one of the many. Therefore was death dissolved. And as they who take
food which they are unable to retain, on account of that vomit up also
what was before lodged in them; so also it happened unto death. That
Body, which he could not digest, he received: and therefore had to cast
forth that which he had within him. Yea, he travailed in pain, whilst he
held Him, and was straitened until He vomited Him up. Wherefore saith
the Apostle, “Having loosed the pains of death.” ([Acts xi.
24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024)<span id="iv.xxv-p53.6"></span>..md)
For never woman labouring of child was so full of anguish as he was torn
and racked in sunder, while he held the Body of the Lord. And that which
happened to the Babylonian dragon, when, having taken the food it burst
asunder in the midst, <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) <span
id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span id="iv.xxv-Page_143"></span>this also
happened unto him. For Christ came not forth again by the mouth of
death, but having burst asunder and ripped up in the very midst, the
belly of the dragon, thus from His secret chambers ([Ps. xix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005)<span id="iv.xxv-p54.2"></span>..md)
right gloriously He issued forth and flung abroad His beams not to this
heaven alone, but to the very throne most high. For even thither did He
carry it up.

<span id="iv.xxv-p55"></span>This Body hath He given to us both to hold
and to eat; a thing appropriate to intense love. For those whom we kiss
vehemently, we oft-times even bite with our teeth. Wherefore also Job,
indicating the love of his servants towards him, said, that they
ofttimes, out of their great affection towards him, said, “Oh! that we
were filled with his flesh!” ([Job xxxi.
31](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#031)<span id="iv.xxv-p55.1"></span>..md)
Even so Christ hath given to us to be filled with His flesh, drawing us
on to greater love.

<span id="iv.xxv-p56"></span>\[8.\] Let us draw nigh to Him then with
fervency and with inflamed love, that we may not have to endure
punishment. For in proportion to the greatness of the benefits bestowed
on us, so much the more exceedingly are we chastised when we show
ourselves unworthy of the bountifulness. This Body, even lying in a
manger, Magi reverenced. Yea, men profane and barbarous, leaving their
country and their home, both set out on a long journey, and when they
came, with fear and great trembling worshipped Him. Let us, then, at
least imitate those Barbarians, we who are citizens of heaven. For they
indeed when they saw Him but in a manger, and in a hut, and no such
thing was in sight as thou beholdest now, drew nigh with great awe; but
thou beholdest Him not in the manger but on the altar, not a woman
holding Him in her arms, but the priest standing by, and the Spirit with
exceeding bounty hovering over the gifts set before us. Thou dost not
see merely this Body itself as they did, but thou knowest also Its
power, and the whole economy, and art ignorant of none of the holy
things which are brought to pass by It, having been exactly initiated
into all.

<span id="iv.xxv-p57"></span>Let us therefore rouse ourselves up and be
filled with horror, and let us show forth a reverence far beyond that of
those Barbarians; that we may not by random and careless approaches heap
fire upon our own heads.  But these things I say, not to keep us from
approaching, but to keep us from approaching without consideration. For
as the approaching at random is dangerous, so the not communicating in
those mystical suppers is famine and death. For this Table is the sinews
of our soul, the bond of our mind, the foundation of our confidence, our
hope, our salvation, our light, our life. When with this sacrifice we
depart into the outer world, with much confidence we shall tread the
sacred threshold, fenced round on every side as with a kind of golden
armor.

<span id="iv.xxv-p58"></span>And why speak I of the world to come? Since
here this mystery makes earth become to thee a heaven. Open only for
once the gates of heaven and look in; nay, rather not of heaven, but of
the heaven of heavens; and then thou wilt behold what I have been
speaking of. For what is there most precious of all, this will I show
thee lying upon the earth. For as in royal palaces, what is most
glorious of all is not walls, nor golden roofs, but the person of the
king sitting on the throne; so likewise in heaven the Body of the King.
But this, thou art now permitted to see upon earth. For it is not
angels, nor archangels, nor heavens and heavens of heavens, that I show
thee, but the very Lord and Owner of these. Perceivest thou how that
which is more precious than all things is seen by thee on earth; and not
seen only, but also touched; and not only touched, but likewise eaten;
and after receiving It thou goest home?

<span id="iv.xxv-p59"></span>Make thy soul clean then, prepare thy mind
for the reception of these mysteries. For if thou wert entrusted to
carry a king’s child with the robes, the purple, and the diadem, thou
wouldest cast away all things which are upon the earth. But now that it
is no child of man how royal soever, but the only-begotten Son of God
Himself, Whom thou receivedst; dost thou not thrill with awe, tell me,
and cast away all the love of all worldly things, and have no bravery
but that wherewith to adorn thyself? or dost thou still look towards
earth, and love money, and pant after gold?  What pardon then canst thou
have? what excuse? Knowest thou not that all this worldly luxury is
loathsome to thy Lord? Was it not for this that on His birth He was laid
in a manger, and took to Himself a mother of low estate? Did He not for
this say to him that was looking after gain, “But the Son of Man hath
not where to lay His head?” (St. [Matt. viii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020)<span id="iv.xxv-p59.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxv-p60"></span>And what did the disciples? Did they not
observe the same law, being taken to houses of the poor and lodged, one
with a tanner, another with a tent-maker, and with the seller of purple?
For they inquired not after the splendor of the house, but for the
virtues of men’s souls.

<span id="iv.xxv-p61"></span>These therefore let us also emulate,
hastening by the beauty of pillars and of marbles, and seeking the
mansions which are above; and let us tread under foot all the pride here
below with all love of money, and acquire a lofty mind.  For if we be
sober-minded, not even this whole world is worthy of us, much less
porticoes and arcades. Wherefore, I beseech you, let us adorn our souls,
let us fit up this house which we are also to have with us when we
depart; that we may attain even to the eternal blessings, through the
grace and mercy, &c.

<span id="iv.xxv-p46"></span> “This Table is not, saith Chrysostom, for
chattering jays, but for eagles, who fly thither where the dead body
lieth.” Hom. Of the worthy receiving of the Sacrament, &c. This
interpretation seems to be generally recognised by the Fathers, See S.
Iren. iv. 14; Orig. on S. Matt. §. 47; S. Ambr. on S. [Luke xvii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.xxv-p46.1"></span>. “The
souls of the righteous are compared unto eagles, because they seek what
is on high, leave the low places, are accounted to lead a long life.
Wherefore also David saith to his own soul, *Thy youth shall be renewed
as of an eagle*. \[[Ps. ciii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.xxv-p46.2"></span>.\] If then we have come to know what the
*eagles* are, we can no longer doubt about the *Body*; especially if we
recollect that Body which Joseph once received from Pilate. Seem they
not unto thee as eagles around a Body, I mean Mary the wife of Cleopas,
and Mary Magdelene and Mary the Mother of the Lord, and the gathering of
the Apostles around the Lord’s entombing? Doth it not seem to thee as
eagles around a body, when the Son of Man shall come with the mystical
clouds, *and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him*?

<span id="iv.xxv-p47"></span>“There is also the Body concerning which it
was said, *My Flesh is meat indeed, and My Blood is drink indeed*.
Around this Body are certain eagles, which hover over It with spiritual
wings. They are also eagles round the Body, which believe the Jesus is
come in the Flesh:  since *every spirit which confesseth that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh, is of God*. Wheresoever then faith is,
there is the Sacrament, there the resting place of holiness. Again, this
Body is the Church, wherein by the grace of Baptism we are renovated in
spirit, and whatever tends to decay through old age is refreshed, for
ages of new life.”
