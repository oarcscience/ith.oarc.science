<span id="v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="v.viii-p1.1"></span>Homily VIII.</span>

<span id="v.viii-p2"></span><span id="v.viii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.viii-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor.
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md),

id="v.viii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.viii-p3"></span>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even
as we obtained mercy we faint not, but we have renounced the hidden
things of shame.

<span id="v.viii-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.viii-p4.1"></span>Seeing</span> he had uttered great things and
had set himself and all the faithful before Moses, aware of the
height <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) and greatness of what he
had said, observe how he moderates his tone again. For it was necessary
on account of the false Apostles to exalt <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) his hearers also, and again to calm
down that swelling; yet not to do it away, since this would be a
trifler’s part <span id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md) . Wherefore he
manages this in another manner, by showing that not of their own merits
was it, but all of the loving-kindness of God. Wherefore also he says,
“Therefore seeing we have this ministry.” For nothing more did we
contribute, except that we became ministers, and made ourselves
subservient to the things given by God. Wherefore he said not
‘largess <span id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) ,’ nor ‘supply <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md) ,’ but ‘ministry.’ Nor was he
contented with this even, but added, “as we obtained mercy.” For even
this itself, he saith, the ministering to these things, is of mercy and
loving-kindness. Yet it is mercy’s to deliver from evils, not to give so
many good things besides: but the mercy of God includes this also.

<span id="v.viii-p10"></span>“We faint not.” And this indeed is to be
imputed to His loving-kindness. For the clause, “as we obtained mercy,”
take to be said with reference both to the “ministry,” and to the words,
“we faint not.”  And observe how earnestly he endeavors to lower his own
things. ‘For,’ saith he, ‘that one who hath been counted worthy of such
and so great things, and this from mercy only and loving-kindness,
should show forth such labors, and undergo dangers, and endure
temptations, is no great matter. Therefore we not only do not sink down,
but we even rejoice and speak boldly.’ For instance, having said, “we
faint not,” he added,

<span id="v.viii-p11"></span>[2 Cor.
4.2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md)<span id="v.viii-p11.1"></span>.
“But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in
craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully.”

<span id="v.viii-p12"></span>And what are “the hidden things of shame?”
We do not, he saith, profess and promise great things, and in our
actions show other things, as they do; wherefore also he said, “Ye look
on things after the outward appearance;” but such we are as we appear,
not having any duplicity, nor saying and doing such things as we ought
to hide and veil over with shame and blushes. And to interpret this, he
added, “not walking in craftiness.” For what they considered to be
praise, that he proves to be shameful and worthy of scorn. But what is,
“in craftiness?” They had the reputation of taking nothing,, but they
took and kept it secret; they had the character of saints and approved
Apostles, but they were full of numberless evil things. But, saith he,
“we have renounced” these things: (for these are what he also calls the
“hidden things of shame;” <span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="v.viii-Page_318"></span>being such as we appear to be, and keeping
nothing veiled over. And that not in this \[our\] life only, but also in
the Preaching itself. For this is, “nor handling the word of God
deceitfully.”

<span id="v.viii-p13"></span>“But by the manifestation of the truth.”

<span id="v.viii-p14"></span>Not by the countenance and the outward
show, but by the very proof of our actions.

<span id="v.viii-p15"></span>“Commending ourselves to every man’s
conscience.”

<span id="v.viii-p16"></span>For not to believers only, but also to
unbelievers, we are manifest; lying open unto all that they may test our
actions, as they may choose; and by this we commend ourselves, not by
acting a part and carrying about a specious mask. We say then, that we
take nothing, and we call you for witnesses; we say that we are
conscious of no wickedness, and of this again we derive the testimony
from you, not as they (sc. false Apostles) who, veiling over their
things, deceive many. But we both set forth our life before all men; and
we lay bare <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) the Preaching, so
that all comprehend it.

<span id="v.viii-p18"></span>\[2.\] Then because the unbelievers knew
not its power, he added, this is no fault of ours, but of their own
insensibility. Wherefore also he saith,

<span id="v.viii-p19"></span>[2 Cor.
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md)<span id="v.viii-p19.1"></span>.
“But if our Gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that are lost; in
whom the God of this world hath blinded the eyes of the unbelieving.”

<span id="v.viii-p20"></span>As he said also before, “To some a savor
from death unto death, to others a savor from life unto life,” ([2 Cor.
2.16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)<span id="v.viii-p20.1"></span>..md)
so he saith here too. But what is “the God of this world?” Those that
are infected with Marcion’s notions <span
id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598.md) , affirm that this is said of the
Creator, the just only, and not good; for they say that there is a
certain God, just and not good. But the Manichees <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md) say that the devil is here intended,
desiring from this passage to introduce another creator of the world
besides the True One, very senselessly. For the Scripture useth often to
employ the term God, not in regard of the dignity of that so designated,
but of the weakness of those in subjection to it; as when it calls
Mammon lord, and the belly god. But neither is the belly therefore God,
nor Mammon Lord, save only of those who bow down themselves to them. But
we assert of this passage that it is spoken neither of the devil nor of
another creator, but of the God of the Universe, and that it is to be
read thus; “God hath blinded the minds of the unbelievers of this
world <span id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) .” For the world to come
hath no unbelievers; but the present only. But if any one should read it
even otherwise, as, for instance, “the God of this world;” neither doth
this afford any handle, for this doth not show Him to be the God of this
world only. For He is called “the God of Heaven,” ([Ps. cxxxvi.
26](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#026.md)<span id="v.viii-p23.2"></span>.
&c.) yet is He not the God of Heaven only; and we say, ‘God of the
present day;’ yet we say this not as limiting His power to it alone. And
moreover He is called the “God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob;” ([Exod. iii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.viii-p23.3"></span>. &c.) and yet He is not the God of them alone.
And one may find many other like testimonies in the Scriptures. How then
“hath” He “blinded” them? Not by working unto this end; away with the
thought! but by suffering and allowing it. For it is usual with the
Scripture so to speak, as when it saith, “God gave them up unto a
reprobate mind.” For when they themselves first disbelieved, and
rendered themselves unworthy to see the mysteries; He Himself also
thereafter permitted it. But what did it behove Him to do? To draw them
by force, and reveal to those who would not see? But so they would have
despised the more, and would not have seen either. Wherefore also he
added,

<span id="v.viii-p24"></span>“That the light of the Gospel of the glory
of Christ should not dawn upon them.”

<span id="v.viii-p25"></span>Not that they might disbelieve in God, but
that unbelief might not see what are the things within, as also He
enjoined us, commanding not to “cast the pearls before the swine.”
([Matt. vii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.viii-p25.1"></span>.) For had He revealed even to those who
disbelieve, their disease would have been the rather aggravated. For if
one compel a man laboring under ophthalmia to look at the sunbeams, he
the rather increases his infirmity. Therefore the physicians <span
id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) even shut them up in darkness, so as
not to aggravate their disorder. So then here also we must consider that
these persons indeed became unbelievers of themselves, but having become
so, they no longer saw the secret things of the Gospel, God thenceforth
excluding its beams from them. <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="v.viii-Page_319"></span>As also he said to the disciples, “Therefore
I speak unto them in proverbs <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602.md) ,
([Matt. xiii. 13](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.viii-p27.1"></span>.) because hearing they hear not.” But what I
say may also become clearer by an example; suppose a Greek, accounting
our religion <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md) to be fables. This
man then, how will he be more advantaged? by going in and seeing the
mysteries, or <span id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md) by remaining
without? Therefore he says, “That the light should not dawn upon them,”
still dwelling on the history of Moses. For what happened to the Jews in
his case, this happeneth to all unbelievers in the case of the Gospel.
And what is that which is overshadowed, and which is not illuminated
unto them? Hear him saying, “That the light of the glorious Gospel of
Christ who is the Image of God, should not dawn upon them.” Namely, that
the Cross is the salvation of the world, and His glory; that this
Crucified One himself is about to come with much splendor; all the other
things, those present, those to come, those seen, those not seen, the
unspeakable splendor of the things looked for. Therefore also he said,
“dawn,” that thou mayest not look for the whole here, for that which is
\[here\] given is only, as it were, a little dawning of the Spirit.
Therefore, also above as indicating this, he spoke of “savor;” (c. [2
Cor. 2.16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.viii-p29.1"></span>.) and again, “earnest,” (c. [2 Cor.
1.25](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#025)<span id="v.viii-p29.2"></span>..md)
showing that the greater part remaineth there.  But nevertheless all
these things have been hidden from them; but had been hidden because
they disbelieved first. Then to show that they are not only ignorant of
the Glory of Christ, but of the Father’s also, since they know not His,
he added, “Who is the Image of God?” For do not halt at Christ only. For
as by Him thou seest the Father, so if thou art ignorant of His Glory,
neither wilt thou know the Father’s.

<span id="v.viii-p30"></span>\[3.\] [2 Cor.
4.5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005.md)<span id="v.viii-p30.1"></span>.
“For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as
your servants for Jesus’ sake.”

<span id="v.viii-p31"></span>And what is the nature of the connexion
there? What hath this in common with what has been said? He either hints
at them <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md) as exalting themselves,
and persuading the disciples to name themselves after them: as he said
in the former Epistle, “I am of Paul and I of Apollos;” or else another
thing of the gravest character. What then is this?  Seeing that they
waged fierce war against them, and plotted against them on every side;
‘Is it,’ he says, ‘with us ye fight and war? \[Nay but\] with Him that
is preached by us, “for we preach not ourselves.” I am a servant, I am
\[but\] a minister even of those who receive the Gospel, transacting
every thing for Another, and for His glory doing whatsover I do. So that
in warring against me thou throwest down what is His. For so far am I
from turning to my own personal advantage any part of the Gospel, that I
will not refuse to be even your servant for Christ’s sake; seeing it
seemed good to Him so to honor you, seeing He so loved you and did all
things for you.’ Wherefore also he saith, “and ourselves your servants
for Christ’s sake.” Seest thou a soul pure from glory? ‘For in truth,’
saith he, ‘we not only do not take to ourselves <span
id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606.md) aught of our Master’s, but even to you
we submit ourselves for His sake.’

<span id="v.viii-p34"></span>[2 Cor.
4.6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md)<span id="v.viii-p34.1"></span>.
“Seeing it is God that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who
shined in your <span id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607.md) hearts.”

<span id="v.viii-p36"></span>Seest thou how again to those who were
desirous of seeing that surpassing glory, I mean that of Moses, he shows
it flashing with added lustre <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md) ?
‘As upon the face of Moses, so also hath it shined unto your hearts,’ he
saith. And first, he puts them in mind of what was made in the beginning
of the Creation, sensible light and darkness sensible, showing that this
creation is greater. And where commanded He light to shine out of
darkness? In the beginning and in prelude to the Creation; for, saith
he, “Darkness was upon the face of the deep. And God said, Let there be
light, and there was light.” Howbeit then indeed He said, “Let it be,
and it was:” but now He said nothing, but Himself became Light for us.
For he <span id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609.md) said not, ‘hath also now
commanded,’ but “hath” Himself “shined.” Therefore neither do we see
sensible objects by the shining of this Light, but God Himself through
Christ. Seest thou the invariableness <span
id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610.md) in the Trinity? For of the Spirit, he
says, “But we all with unveiled face reflecting in a mirror the glory of
the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory even
as from the Lord the Spirit.” (c. [2 Cor.
3.18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018)<span id="v.viii-p39.3"></span>..md)
And of the Son; “That the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, Who is
the Image of God, should not dawn upon them.” ([2 Cor.
4.4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)<span id="v.viii-p39.4"></span>..md)
And of the Father; “He that said Light shall shine out of darkness
shined in your hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Christ.” For as when he had said, “Of the Gospel
of the glory of Christ,” he added, “Who is the Image of God,” showing
that they were deprived of His <span id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611.md)
glory also; So after saying, “the knowledge of God,” he added, “in the
face of Christ,’ to show that through Him we know <span id="page_320">p.
320</span> <span id="v.viii-Page_320"></span>the Father, even as through
the Spirit also we are brought unto Him.

<span id="v.viii-p41"></span>[2 Cor.
4.7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md)<span id="v.viii-p41.1"></span>.
“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding
greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.”

<span id="v.viii-p42"></span>For seeing he had spoken many and great
things of the unspeakable glory, lest any should say, ‘And how enjoying
so great a glory remain we in a mortal body?’ he saith, that this very
thing is indeed the chiefest marvel and a very great example of the
power of God, that an earthen vessel hath been enabled to bear so great
a brightness and to keep so high a treasure. And therefore as admiring
this, he said, “That the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God,
and not from ourselves;” again alluding to those who gloried in
themselves. For both the greatness of the things given and the weakness
of them that receive show His power; in that He not only gave great
things, but also to those who are little. For he used the term “earthen”
in allusion to the frailty <span id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612.md) of
our mortal nature, and to declare the weakness of our flesh. For it is
nothing better constituted than earthenware; so is it soon damaged, and
by death and disease and variations of temperature and ten thousand
other things easily dissolved. And he said these things both to take
down their inflation, and to show to all that none of the things we
hold <span id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md) is human. For then is the
power of God chiefly conspicuous, when by vile it worketh mighty things.
Wherefore also in another place He said, “For My power is made perfect
in weakness.” ([2 Cor. xii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.viii-p44.2"></span>.) And indeed in the Old \[Testament\] whole
hosts of barbarians were turned to flight by gnats and flies, wherefore
also He calleth the caterpillar His mighty force <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md) ; ([Joel ii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025)<span id="v.viii-p45.3"></span>..md)
and in the beginning, by only confounding tongues, He put a stop to that
great tower in Babylon. And in their wars too, at one time, He routed
innumerable hosts by three hundred men; at another He overthrew cities
by trumpets; and afterwards by a little and poor <span
id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md) stripling, David, He turned to flight
the whole army of barbarians. So then here also, sending forth twelve
only He overcame the world; twelve, and those, persecuted, warred
against.

<span id="v.viii-p47"></span>\[4.\] Let us then be amazed at the Power
of God, admire, adore it. Let us ask Jews, let us ask Greeks, who
persuaded the whole world to desert from their fathers’ usages, and to
go over to another way of life? The fisherman, or the tentmaker? the
publican, or the unlearned and ignorant? And how can these things stand
with reason, except it were Divine Power which achieveth all by their
means? And what too did they say to persuade them?  ‘Be baptized in the
Name of The Crucified.’ Of what kind of man <span
id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md) ? One they had not seen nor looked
upon. But nevertheless saying and preaching these things, they persuaded
them that they who gave them oracles, and whom they had received by
tradition from their forefathers, were no Gods:  whilst this Christ, He
Who was nailed \[to the wood,\] drew them all unto Himself. And yet that
He was indeed crucified and buried, was manifest in a manner to all; but
that He was risen again, none save a few saw. But still of this too they
persuaded those who had not beheld; and not that He rose again only, but
that He ascended also into Heaven, and cometh to judge quick and dead.
Whence then the persuasiveness of these sayings, tell me? From nothing
else than the Power of God. For, in the first place, innovation
itself <span id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md) was offensive to all; but
when too one innovates in such things, the matter becomes more grievous:
when one tears up <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) the
foundations of ancient custom, when one plucks laws from their seat. And
besides all this, neither did the heralds seem worthy of credit, but
they were both of a nation hated amongst all men, and were timorous and
ignorant. Whence then overcame they the world? Whence cast they out you,
and those your forefathers who were reputed to be philosophers, along
with their very gods? Is it not quite evident that it was from having
God with them? For neither are these successes of human, but of some
divine and unspeakable, power. ‘No,’ saith one, ‘but of witchcraft.’
Then certainly ought the power of the demons to have increased and the
worship of idols to have extended. How then have they been overthrown
and have vanished, and our things the reverse of these? So that from
this even it is manifest that what was done was the decree of God; and
not from the Preaching only, but also from the title of life itself. For
when was virginity so largely planted every where in the world? when
contempt of wealth, and of life, and of all things besides? For such as
were wicked and wizards, would have effected nothing like this, but the
contrary in all respects: whilst these introduced amongst us the life of
angels; and not introduced merely, but established it in our own land,
in that of the barbarians, in the very extremities of the earth. Whence
it is manifest that it was the power of Christ every where that effected
all, which every where shineth, and swifter than any lightning illumeth
the hearts of men. All these things, then, considering, and accepting
what hath been done as a clear proof of the promise <span
id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span id="v.viii-Page_321"></span>of the
things to come, worship with us the invincible might of The Crucified,
that ye may both escape the intolerable punishments, and obtain the
everlasting kingdom; of which may all we partake through the grace and
love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ; to Whom be glory world
without end. Amen.

<span id="v.viii-p23"></span> \[This is one of the few instances in
which the expositor allowed himself to be diverted by dogmatic
considerations from the true meaning of the word. It is exceedingly
awkward to make *of this world* depend upon unbelievers, and not upon
the substantive *God* which immediately precedes. The natural and
legitimate construction is the one given in both the English versions,
“the God of this world (or age).” But Chrysostom was led to depart from
it, as Augustin was afterwards, and Origen and Tertullian had been
before, by a desire to resist the Marcionites and the Manichæans who
were accustomed to quote this passage in favor of their doctrine of two
eternal principles, the one good, the other evil. But the ordinary
rendering of the phrase gives no countenance to the *Dualism*, which for
so many centuries opposed and embarrassed the early Church. It is, alas,
too certain that Satan rules this world as if he were a God, and from
the multitude he receives the service which is due to the Most High
alone, but this fact by no means exalts him to an equality with the
maker of all or makes him an original and co-eternal principle of life
and action. It is because men turn away from the glory of God as it
shines in the face of Jesus Christ that God permits Satan to destroy, in
whole or in part, their capacity for spiritual vision. Such a work is
eminently appropriate in him who is prince of “the world-rulers of this
darkness” ([Ephes. vi. 12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.viii-p23.1"></span> Rev. Ver.), and the element of whose being is
deceit and falsehood. C.\]
