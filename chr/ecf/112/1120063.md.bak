<span id="v.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Homily XIV.</span>

<span id="v.xiv-p2"></span><span id="v.xiv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.xiv-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor.
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003.md)<span id="v.xiv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xiv-p3"></span>*Open your hearts to us: we wronged no man,
we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man. I say it not to
condemn you; for l have said before, \[as I have also declared
above\]* <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) *, that ye are in our
hearts to die together and live together.*

<span id="v.xiv-p5"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.xiv-p5.1"></span>Again</span> he raiseth the discourse about love,
mitigating the harshness of his rebuke. For since he had convicted and
reproached them as being beloved indeed, yet not loving in an equal
degree, but breaking away from his love and mixing up with other
pestilent fellows; again he softens the vehemence of his rebuke, saying,
“Make room for us,” that is, “love us;” and prays to receive a favor
involving no burden, and advantaging them that confer above them that
receive it. And he said not, ‘love,’ but with a stronger appeal to their
<span id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span
id="v.xiv-Page_347"></span>pity <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md)
, “make room for.” ‘Who expelled us?’ saith he: ‘Who cast us out of your
hearts?  How come we to be straitened in you?’ for since he said above,
“Ye are straitened in your affections;” here declaring it more clearly,
he said, “make room for us:” in this way also again winning them to
himself. For nothing doth so produce love as for the beloved to know
that he that loveth him exceedingly desireth his love.

<span id="v.xiv-p7"></span>“We wronged no man.” See how again he does
not mention the benefits \[done by him\], but frameth his speech in
another way, so as to be both less offensive and more cutting <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) . And at the same time he also alludes
to the false apostles, saying, “We wronged no man, we corrupted no man,
we defrauded no man.”

<span id="v.xiv-p9"></span>What is “we corrupted?” That is, we beguiled
no man; as he says elsewhere also. “Lest by any means, as the serpent
beguiled Eve, so your minds should be corrupted.” ([2 Cor. xi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)<span id="v.xiv-p9.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.xiv-p10"></span>“We defrauded no man;” we plundered, plotted
against no man. And he for the present forbears to say, ‘we benefited
you in such and such ways;’ but framing his language so as more to shame
them, “We wronged no man,” he says; as much as saying, ‘Even had we in
no wise benefited you, not even so ought ye to turn away from us; for ye
have nothing to lay to our charge, either small or great.’ Then, for he
felt the heaviness of his rebuke, he tempers it again. And he was
neither silent altogether, for so he would not have aroused them; nor
yet did he let the harshness of his language go unmodified, for so he
would have wounded them too much. And what says he?

<span id="v.xiv-p11"></span>[2 Cor.
7.3](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#003.md)<span id="v.xiv-p11.1"></span>. “I
say it not to condemn you.”

<span id="v.xiv-p12"></span>How is this evident? “For I have said
before,” he adds, “that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.”
This is the greatest affection, when even though treated with contempt,
he chooseth both to die and live with them. ‘For neither are ye merely
in our hearts,’ he says, ‘but in such sort as I said. For it is possible
both to love and to shun dangers, but we do not thus.’ And behold here
also wisdom unspeakable. For he spake not of what had been done for
them, that he might not seem to be again reproaching them, but he
promiseth for the future. ‘For should it chance,’ saith he, ‘that danger
should invade, for your sakes I am ready to suffer every thing; and
neither death nor life seemeth aught to me in itself, but in whichever
ye be, that is to me more desirable, both death than life and life than
death.’ Howbeit, dying indeed is manifestly a proof of love; but living,
who is there that would not choose, even of those who are not friends?
Why then does the Apostle mention it as something great? Because it is
even exceeding great. For numbers indeed sympathize with their friends
when they are in misfortune, but when they are in honor rejoice not
with, but envy, them. ‘But not so we; but whether ye be in calamity, we
are not afraid to share your ill fortune; or whether ye be prosperous,
we are not wounded with envy.’

<span id="v.xiv-p13"></span>\[2.\] Then after he had continually
repeated these things, saying, “Ye are not straitened in us;” and, “Ye
are straitened in your own affections;” and, “make room for us;” and,
“Be ye also enlarged;” and, “We wronged no man;” and all these things
seemed to be a condemnation of them: observe how he also in another
manner alleviates this severity by saying, “Great is my boldness of
speech towards you.” ‘Therefore I venture upon such things,’ he says,
‘not to condemn you by what I say, but out of my great boldness of
speech,’ which also farther signifying, he said, “Great is my glorying
on your behalf.” ‘For think not indeed,’ he saith, ‘that because I thus
speak, I speak as though I had condemned you altogether; (for I am
exceedingly proud of, and glory in, you;) but both out of tender concern
and a desire that you should make greater increase unto virtue.’ And so
he said to the Hebrews also after much rebuke; “But we are persuaded
better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we
thus speak: and we desire that each one of you may show the same
diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end.” ([Heb.
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011)<span id="v.xiv-p13.1"></span>..md) So
indeed here also, “Great is my glorying on your behalf.” ‘We glory to
others of you,’ he says. Seest thou what genuine comfort he has given?
‘And,’ he saith, ‘I do not simply glory, but also, greatly.’ Accordingly
he added these words; “I am filled with comfort.” What comfort? ‘That
coming from you; because that ye, having been reformed, comforted me by
your conduct.’ This is the test of one that loveth, both to complain of
not being loved and to fear lest he should inflict pain by complaining
immoderately. Therefore he says, “I am filled with comfort, I overflow
with joy.” ‘But these expressions,’ saith one, ‘seem to contradict the
former.’ They do not do so, however, but are even exceedingly in harmony
with them. For these procure for the former a favorable reception; and
the praise which they convey makes the benefit of those rebukes more
genuine, by quietly abstracting what was painful in them. Wherefore he
uses these expressions, but with great genuineness and earnestness <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) . For he did <span id="page_348">p.
348</span> <span id="v.xiv-Page_348"></span>not say, ‘I am filled with
joy;’ but, “I abound;” or rather, not “abound” either, but
“superabound;” in this way also again showing his yearning, that even
though he be so loved as to rejoice and exult, he does not yet think
himself loved as he ought to be loved, nor to have received full
payment; so insatiable was he out of his exceeding love of them. For the
joy it brings to be loved in any degree by those one passionately loves,
is great by reason of our loving them exceedingly. So that this again
was a proof of his affection. And of the comfort indeed, he saith, “I am
filled;” ‘I have received what was owing to me;’ but of the joy, “I
superabound;” that is, ‘I was desponding about you; but ye have
sufficiently excused yourselves and supplied comfort:  for ye have not
only removed the ground of my sorrow, but have even increased joy.’ Then
showing its greatness, he not only declares it by saying, “I superabound
in joy,” but also by adding, “in all our affliction.” ‘For so great was
the delight arising to us on your account that it was not even dimmed by
so great tribulation, but through the excess of its own greatness it
overcame the sorrows that had hold of us, and suffered us not to feel
the sense of them.’

<span id="v.xiv-p15"></span>[2 Cor.
7.5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md)<span id="v.xiv-p15.1"></span>.
“For even when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief.”

<span id="v.xiv-p16"></span>For since he said, “our tribulation;” he
both explains of what sort it was, and magnifies it by his words, in
order to show that the consolation and joys received from them <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) was great, seeing it had repelled so
great a sorrow. “But we were afflicted on every side.”

<span id="v.xiv-p18"></span>How on every side? for “without were
fightings,” from the unbelievers; “within were fears;” because of the
weak among the believers, lest they should be drawn aside. For not
amongst the Corinthians only did these things happen, but elsewhere
also.

<span id="v.xiv-p19"></span>[2 Cor.
7.6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006.md)<span id="v.xiv-p19.1"></span>.
“Nevertheless He that comforteth the lowly comforted us by <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) the coming of Titus.”

<span id="v.xiv-p21"></span>For since he had testified great things of
them in what he said, that he may not seem to be flattering them he
cites as witness Titus the brother <span
id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) , who had come from them to Paul after
the first Epistle to declare unto him the particulars of their
amendment. But consider, I pray you, how in every place he maketh a
great matter of the coming of Titus. For he saith also before,
“Furthermore when I came to Troas for the Gospel, I had no relief for my
spirit because I found not Titus my brother;” (c. [2 Cor.
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013)<span id="v.xiv-p22.1"></span>..md)
and in this place again “we were comforted,” he saith, “by the coming of
Titus.” For he is desirous also of establishing the man in their
confidence and of making him exceedingly dear to them. And observe how
he provides for both these things. For by saying on the one hand, “I had
no relief for my spirit,” he showeth the greatness of his virtue; and by
saying on the other, that, in our tribulation his coming sufficed unto
comfort; yet “not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith
he was comforted in you,” he endeareth <span
id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) the man unto the Corinthians. For
nothing doth so produce and cement friendships as the saying something
sound and favorable of any one. And such he testifies Titus did; when he
says that ‘by his coming he hath given us wings with pleasure; such
things did he report of you. On this ground his coming made us glad. For
we were delighted not “only by his coming, but also for the comfort
wherewith he was comforted in you.” And how was he comforted? By your
virtue, by your good deeds.’ Wherefore also he adds,

<span id="v.xiv-p24"></span>“While he told us your longing, your
mourning, your zeal for me.” ‘These things made him glad,’ he says,
‘these things comforted him.’ Seest thou how he shows that he also is an
earnest lover of theirs, seeing he considers their good report as a
consolation to himself; and when he was come, gloried, as though on
account of his own good things, unto Paul.

<span id="v.xiv-p25"></span>And observe with what warmth of expression
he reporteth these things, “Your longing, your mourning, your zeal.” For
it was likely <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) that they would
mourn and grieve why the blessed Paul was so much displeased, why he had
kept away from them so long. And therefore he did not say simply tears,
but “mourning;” nor desire, but “longing;” nor anger, but “zeal;” and
again “zeal toward him,” which they displayed both about him that had
committed fornication and about those who were accusing him. ‘For,’
saith he, ‘ye were inflamed and blazed out on receiving my letters.’ On
these accounts he abounds in joy, on these accounts he is filled with
consolation, because he made them feel. It seems to me, however, that
these things are said not only to soften what has gone before, but also
in encouragement of those who had acted in these things virtuously. For
although I suppose that some were obnoxious to those former accusations
and unworthy of these praises; nevertheless, he doth not distinguish
them, but makes both the praises and the accusations common, leaving it
to the conscience of his hearers to select that which belongs to them.
For so both the one would be void of offence, and the other lead them on
to much fervor of mind.

<span id="v.xiv-p27"></span><span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="v.xiv-Page_349"></span>\[4.\] Such also now should be the feelings
of those who are reprehended; thus should they lament and mourn; thus
yearn after their teachers; thus, more than fathers, seek them. For by
those indeed living cometh, but by these good living. Thus ought they to
bear the rebukes of their fathers, thus to sympathize with their rulers
on account of those that sin. For it does not rest all with them, but
with you also.  For if he that hath sinned perceives that he was rebuked
indeed by his father, but flattered by his brethren; he becometh more
easy of mind. But when the father rebukes, be thou too angry as well,
whether as concerned for thy brother or as joining in thy father’s
indignation; only be the earnestness thou showest great; and mourn, not
that he was rebuked, but that he sinned. But if I build up and thou pull
down, what profit have we had but labor? ([Ecclesiasticus
34.23](../../../bib/apo/sir034.htm#023)<span id="v.xiv-p27.1"></span>..md)
Yea, rather, thy loss stops not here, but thou bringest also punishment
on thyself. For he that hindereth the wound from being healed is
punished not less than he that inflicted it, but even more. For it is
not an equal offence to wound and to hinder that which is wounded from
being healed; for this indeed necessarily gendereth death, but that not
necessarily. Now I have spoken thus to you; that ye may join in the
anger of your rulers whenever they are indignant justly; that when ye
see any one rebuked, ye may all shun him more than does the teacher. Let
him that hath offended fear you more than his rulers. For if he is
afraid of his teacher only, he will readily sin: but if he have to dread
so many eyes, so many tongues, he will be in greater safety. For as, if
we do not thus act, we shall suffer the extremest punishment; so, if we
perform these things, we shall partake of the gain that accrues from his
reformation. Thus then let us act; and if any one shall say, ‘be humane
towards thy brother, this is a Christian’s duty;’ let him be taught,
that he is humane who is angry \[with him\], not he who sets him at
ease <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) prematurely and alloweth
him not even to come to a sense of his transgression. For which, tell
me, pities the man in a fever and laboring under delirium, he that lays
him on his bed, and binds him down, and keeps him from meats and drinks
that are not fit for him; or he that allows him to glut himself with
strong drink, and orders him to have his liberty, and to act in every
respect as one that is in health? Does not this person even aggravate
the distemper, the man that seemeth to act humanely, whereas the other
amends it? Such truly ought our decision to be in this case also. For it
is the part of humanity, not to humor the sick in every thing nor to
flatter their unseasonable desires. No one so loved him that committed
fornication amongst the Corinthians, as Paul who commandeth to deliver
him to Satan; no one so hated him as they that applaud and court him;
and the event showed it. For they indeed both puffed him up and
increased his inflammation; but \[the Apostle\] both lowered it and left
him not until he brought him to perfect health. And they indeed added to
the existing mischief, he eradicated even that which existed from the
first. These laws, then, of humanity let us learn also. For if thou
seest a horse hurrying down a precipice, thou appliest a bit and holdest
him in with violence and lashest him frequently; although this is
punishment, yet the punishment itself is the mother of safety. Thus act
also in the case of those that sin. Bind him that hath transgressed
until he have appeased God; let him not go loose, that he be not bound
the faster by the anger of God. If I bind, God doth not chain; if I bind
not, the indissoluble chains await him. “For if we judged ourselves, we
should not be judged. ([1 Cor. xi.
31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031)<span id="v.xiv-p28.7"></span>..md)
Think not, then, that thus to act cometh of cruelty and inhumanity; nay,
but of the highest gentleness and the most skillful leechcraft and of
much tender care. But, saith one, they have been punished for a long
time. How long? Tell me. A year, and two, and three years? Howbeit, I
require not this, length of time, but amendment of soul. This then show,
whether they have been pricked to the heart, whether they have reformed,
and all is done: since if there be not this, there is no advantage in
the time. For neither do we inquire whether the wound has been often
bandaged, but whether the bandage has been of any service. If therefore
it hath been of service, although in a short time, let it be kept on no
longer: but if it hath done no service, even at the end of ten years,
let it be still kept on: and let this fix the term of release, the good
of him that is bound. If we are thus careful both of ourselves and of
others, and regard not honor and dishonor at the hands of men; but
bearing in mind the punishment and the disgrace that is there, and above
all the provoking of God, apply with energy the medicines of repentance:
we shall both presently arrive at the perfect health, and shall obtain
the good things to come; which may all we obtain, through the grace and
love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the Father,
with the Holy Spirit, be glory, might, honor, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.
