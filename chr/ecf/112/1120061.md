<span id="v.xii-p2"></span><span id="v.xii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.xii-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor.
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md)<span id="v.xii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xii-p3"></span>And working together with Him we intreat also
that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. For he saith, At an
acceptable time I hearkened unto thee. And in a day of salvation did I
succor thee.

<span id="v.xii-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.xii-p4.1"></span>For</span> since he said, God beseeches, and we
are ambassadors and suppliants unto you, that ye be “reconciled unto
God:” lest they should become supine, he hereby again alarms and arouses
them, saying: “We intreat that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.”
‘For let us not,’ he says, ‘therefore be at ease, because He beseeches
and hath sent some to be ambassadors; nay, but for this very reason let
us make haste to please God and to collect spiritual merchandise;’ as
also he said above, “The love of God constraineth us,” ([2 Cor.
5.14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014)<span id="v.xii-p4.2"></span>..md)
that is presseth, driveth, urgeth us, ‘that ye may not after so much
affectionate care, by being supine and exhibiting no nobleness, miss of
such great blessings. Do not therefore because He hath sent some to
exhort you, deem that this will always be so. It will be so until His
second coming; until then He beseeches, so long as we are here; but
after that is judgment and punishment.’ Therefore, he says, “we are
constrained.”

<span id="v.xii-p5"></span>For not only from the greatness of the
blessings and His loving kindness, but also from the shortness of the
time he urgeth them continually. Wherefore he saith also elsewhere, “For
now is our salvation nearer.” ([Rom. xiii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011)<span id="v.xii-p5.1"></span>..md) And
again; “The Lord is at hand.” ([Philip. iv.
5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005)<span id="v.xii-p5.2"></span>..md) But
here he does something yet more. For not from the fact that the
remainder of the time is short and little, but also from its being the
only season available, for salvation, he incited them.

<span id="v.xii-p6"></span>For, “Behold,” he saith, “now is the
acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” Let us therefore
not let slip the favorable opportunity but display a zeal worthy of the
grace. For therefore is it that we also press forward, knowing both the
shortness and the suitableness of the time. Wherefore also he said; “And
working together we intreat also. Working together” with you; ‘for we
work together with you, rather than with God for Whom we are
ambassadors. For He is in need of nothing, but the salvation all passeth
over to you.’ But if it is even with God that he speaks of working
together, he repudiates not even this \[interpretation\]; for he says in
another place, “we are God’s fellow-workers:” ([1 Cor. iii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009)<span id="v.xii-p6.1"></span>..md) in
this way, saith he, to save men. Again, “We entreat also.” For he
indeed, when beseeching, doth not barely beseech, but sets forth these
His just claims; namely, that He gave His Son, the Righteous One that
did not so much as know sin, and made Him to be sin for us sinners, that
we might become righteous: which claims having, and being God, He
displayed such goodness. But what we beseech is that ye would receive
the benefit and not reject the gift. Be persuaded therefore by us, and
“receive not the grace in vain.” For lest they should think that this of
itself is “reconciliation,” believing on Him that calleth; he adds these
words, requiting that earnestness which respects the life. For, for one
who hath been freed from sins and made a friend to wallow in the former
things, is to return again unto enmity, and to “receive the grace in
vain,” in respect of the life. For from “the grace” we reap no benefit
towards salvation, if we live impurely; nay, we are even harmed, having
this greater aggravation even of our sins, in that after such knowledge
and such a gift we have gone back to our former vices. This however he
does not mention as yet: that he may not make his work harsh, but says
only that we reap no benefit. Then he also reminds of a prophecy, urging
and compelling them to bestir themselves in order to lay hold of their
own salvation.

<span id="v.xii-p7"></span>“For,” saith he, “He saith,

<span id="v.xii-p8"></span>“At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee,

<span id="v.xii-p9"></span>“And in a day of salvation did I succor thee:

<span id="v.xii-p10"></span>“behold, now is the acceptable time: behold,
now is the day of salvation.”

<span id="v.xii-p11"></span>“The acceptable time.” What is this? That
<span id="page_337">p. 337</span> <span id="v.xii-Page_337"></span>of
the Gift, that of the Grace, when it is appointed not that an account
should be required of our sins nor penalty exacted; but besides being
delivered, that we should also enjoy ten thousand goods, righteousness,
sanctification, and all the rest. For how much toil would it have
behoved us to undergo in order to obtain this “time!” But, behold,
without our toiling at all it hath come, bringing remission of all that
was before. Wherefore also He calls it “acceptable,” because He both
accepted those that had transgressed in ten thousand things, and not
acceded merely, but advanced them to the highest honor; just as when a
monarch arrives, it is a time not for judgment, but for grace and
pardon. Wherefore also He calleth it acceptable. Whilst then we are yet
in the lists <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) , whilst we are at
work in the vineyard, whilst the eleventh hour is left \[us\], let us
draw nigh and show forth life; for it is also easy. For he that striveth
for the mastery <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) at such a time,
when so great a gift hath been shed forth, when so great grace, will
early obtain the prizes. For in the case of monarchs here below also, at
the time of their festivals, and when they appear in the dress of
Consuls, he who bringeth a small offering receiveth large gifts; but on
the days in which they sit in judgment, much strictness, much sifting is
requisite. Let us too therefore strive for the mastery in the time of
this gift. It is a day of grace, of grace divine; wherefore with ease
even we shall obtain the crown. For if when laden with so great evils He
both received and delivered us: when delivered from all and contributing
our part, shall He not rather accept us?

<span id="v.xii-p14"></span>\[2.\] Then, as it is his constant wont,
namely, to place himself before them and bid them hence to take their
example, so he does in this place also. Wherefore also he addeth,

<span id="v.xii-p15"></span>[2 Cor.
6.3](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#003.md)<span id="v.xii-p15.1"></span>.
“Giving no occasion of stumbling, that our ministration <span
id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) be not blamed,” persuading them not
from considering “the time” only, but also those that had successfully
labored with them. And behold with what absence of pride <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) . For he said not, ‘Look at us how we
are such and such,’ but, for the present, it is only to do away
accusation that he relates his own conduct. And he mentions two chief
points of a blameless life, “none” in “any” thing. And he said not
‘accusation,’ but, what was far less, “occasion of stumbling;” that is,
giving ground against us to none for censure, for condemnation, “that
our ministration be not blamed;” that is, that none may take hold of it.
And again, he said not, ‘that it be not accused,’ but that it may not
have the least fault, nor any one have it in his power to animadvert
upon it in any particular.

<span id="v.xii-p18"></span>[2 Cor.
5.4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md)<span id="v.xii-p18.1"></span>.
“But in every thing commending ourselves as ministers of God.”

<span id="v.xii-p19"></span>This is far greater.  For it is not the same
thing to be free from accusation; and to exhibit such a character as in
everything to appear “ministers of God.” For neither is it the same
thing to be quit of accusation, and to be covered <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) with praises. And he said not
appearing, but “commending,” that is ‘proving.’ Then he mentions also
whence they became such. Whence then was it? “In much patience,” he
says, laying the foundation of those good things. Wherefore he said not
barely “patience,” but “much,” and he shows also how great it was. For
to bear some one or two things is no great matter. But he addeth even
snow storms of trials in the words, “In afflictions, in necessities.”
This is a heightening of affliction, when the evils are unavoidable, and
there lies upon one as it were a necessity hardly extricable <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) of misfortune. “In distresses.” Either
he means those of hunger and of other necessaries, or else simply those
of their trials.

<span id="v.xii-p22"></span>[2 Cor.
6.5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005.md)<span id="v.xii-p22.1"></span>. “In
stripes, in imprisonments, in tossings to and fro <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) .”

<span id="v.xii-p24"></span>Yet every one of these by itself was
intolerable, the being scourged only, and being bound only, and being
unable through persecution to remain fixed <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) any where, (for this is in ‘tossings
to and fro,’) but when both all, and all at once, assail, consider what
a soul they need. Then along with the things from without, he mentions
those imposed by himself.

<span id="v.xii-p26"></span>[2 Cor.
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006.md)<span id="v.xii-p26.1"></span>. “In
labors, in watchings, in fastings; in pureness.”

<span id="v.xii-p27"></span>But by “pureness” here, he means either
chasteness again, or general purity, or incorruptness, or even his
preaching the Gospel freely.

<span id="v.xii-p28"></span>“In knowledge.” What is “in knowledge?” In
wisdom such as is given from God; that which is truly knowledge; not as
those that seem to be wise and boast of their acquaintance <span
id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span id="v.xii-Page_338"></span>with the
heathen discipline, but are deficient in this.

<span id="v.xii-p29"></span>“In long-suffering, in kindness.” For this
also is a great note of a noble soul, though exasperated and goaded on
every side, to bear all with long-suffering. Then to show whence he
became such, he added;

<span id="v.xii-p30"></span>“In the Holy Ghost.” ‘For in Him,’ he saith,
‘we do all these good works.’ But observe when it is that he has
mentioned the aid of the Holy Ghost. After he had set forth what was
from himself. Moreover, he seems to me to say another thing herein. What
then is this? Namely, ‘we have both been filled with abundance of the
Spirit and hereby also give a proof of our Apostleship in that we have
been counted worthy of spiritual gifts.’ For if this be grace also, yet
still he himself was the cause who by his good works and his toils <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) attracted that grace. And if any
should assert that besides what has been said, he shows that in his use
of the gifts of the Spirit also he gave none offence; he would not miss
of his meaning. For they who received the \[gift of\] tongues amongst
them and were lifted up, were blamed. For it is possible for one even in
receiving a gift of the Spirit, not to use it aright. ‘But not so we,’
he saith, ‘but in the Spirit also, that is, in the gifts also, we have
been blameless.’

<span id="v.xii-p32"></span>“In love unfeigned.” This was the cause of
all those good things; this made him what he was; this caused the Spirit
also to abide with him, by Whose aid also all things were rightly done
of him.

<span id="v.xii-p33"></span>[2 Cor.
6.7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007.md)<span id="v.xii-p33.1"></span>. “In
the word of truth.”

<span id="v.xii-p34"></span> A thing he says in many places, that ‘we
continued neither to handle the word of God deceitfully nor to
adulterate it.’

<span id="v.xii-p35"></span>“In the power of God.” That which he always
does ascribing nothing to himself but the whole to God, and imputing
whatsoever he hath done aright to Him, this he hath done here also. For
since he uttered great things, and affirmed that he had manifested in
all things an irreproachable life and exalted wisdom, he ascribes this
to the Spirit and to God. For neither were those commonplace things
which he had said. For if it be a difficult thing even for one who lives
in quiet to do aright and be irreproachable, consider him who was
harassed by so great temptations, and yet shone forth through all, what
a spirit he was of!  And yet he underwent not these alone, but even far
more than these, as he mentions next. And what is indeed marvelous is,
not that he was irreproachable though sailing in such mighty waves, nor
that he endured all nobly, but all with pleasure even. Which things,
all, he makes clear to us by the next words, saying,

<span id="v.xii-p36"></span>“By the armor of righteousness on the right
and the left.”

<span id="v.xii-p37"></span>\[3.\] Seest thou his self-possession of
soul and well-strung spirit? For he shows that afflictions are arms not
only which strike not down, but do even fortify and make stronger. And
he calls those things ‘left,’ which seem to be painful; for such those
are which bring with them the reward. Wherefore then doth he call them
thus? Either in conformity with the conception of the generality, or
because God commanded us to pray that we enter not into temptation.

<span id="v.xii-p38"></span>[2 Cor.
6.8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008.md)<span id="v.xii-p38.1"></span>. “By
glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report.”

<span id="v.xii-p39"></span>What saying thou? That thou enjoyest honor,
and setting down this as a great thing? ‘Yes,’ he saith. Why, forsooth?
For to bear dishonor indeed is a great thing, but to partake of honor
requires not a vigorous <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) soul.
Nay, it needs a vigorous and exceeding great soul, that he who enjoys it
may not be thrown and break his neck <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md) . Wherefore he glories in this as well
as in that, for he shone equally in both. But how is it a weapon of
righteousness? Because that the teachers are held in honor induceth many
unto godliness. And besides, this is a proof of good works, and this
glorifieth God. And this is, further, an instance of the wise
contrivance of God, that by things which are opposite He brings in the
Preaching. For consider. Was Paul bound? This too was on behalf of the
Gospel. For, saith he, “the things which happened unto me have fallen
out unto the progress of the Gospel; so that most of the brethren, being
confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word
without fear.” ([Phil. 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014)<span id="v.xii-p41.3"></span>..md)
Again, did he enjoy honor? This too again rendered them more forward.
“By evil report and good report.” For not only did he bear those things
nobly which happen to the body, the ‘afflictions,’ and whatever he
enumerated, but those also which touch the soul; for neither are these
wont to disturb slightly. Jeremiah at least having borne many
temptations, gave in <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) upon these,
and when he was reproached, said, “I will not prophesy, neither will I
name the Name of the Lord. <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) ”
([Jer. xx. 9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.xii-p43.1"></span>.) And David too many places complains of
reproach. Isaiah also, after many things, exhorteth concerning this,
saying, “Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye overcome by
their reviling.” ([Is. li. 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.xii-p43.2"></span>. LXX.) And again, Christ also to His disciples;
“When they shall speak all manner of evil against you falsely, rejoice
and be exceeding glad,” ([Matt. 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012)<span id="v.xii-p43.3"></span>..md) He
saith, “for great is your reward in heaven.” Elsewhere too He <span
id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span id="v.xii-Page_339"></span>says,” And
leap for joy.” ([Luke vi. 23](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#023.md)<span
id="v.xii-p43.4"></span>.) But He would not have made the reward so
great, had not the contest been a great one. For in tortures the body
also shareth the anguish with the soul; for the pain is both of the body
and of the soul; but here it is of the soul alone. Many at any rate have
fallen by these alone, and have lost their own souls. And to Job also
the reproaches of his friends appeared more grievous than the worms and
the sores. For there is nothing, there is nothing more intolerable to
those in affliction than a word capable of stinging the soul. Wherefore
along with the perils and the toils he names these also, saying, “By
glory and dishonor.” At any rate, many of the Jews also on account of
glory derived from the many would not believe. For they feared, not lest
they should be punished, but lest they should be put out of the
synagogue. Wherefore He saith, “How can ye believe which receive glory
one of another?” ([John v. 44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md)<span
id="v.xii-p43.5"></span>.) And we may see numbers who have indeed
despised all dangers, but have been worsted by glory.

<span id="v.xii-p44"></span>\[4.\] “As deceivers, and yet true.”

<span id="v.xii-p45"></span>This is, “by evil report and good report.”

<span id="v.xii-p46"></span>[2 Cor.
6.9](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009.md)<span id="v.xii-p46.1"></span>. “As
unknown, and yet well known.” This is, “by glory and dishonor.” For by
some they were well known and much sought after, whilst others designed
not to know them at all.

<span id="v.xii-p47"></span>“As dying, and behold, we live.”

<span id="v.xii-p48"></span>As under sentence of death and condemned;
which was itself also matter of dishonor. But this he said, to show both
the unspeakable power of God and their own patience. For so far as those
who plotted against us were concerned, we died; and this is what all
suppose; but by God’s aid we escaped the dangers. Then to manifest also
on what account God permits these things, he added, “As chastened, and
not killed.”

<span id="v.xii-p49"></span>Showing that the gain accruing to them from
their temptations, even before the rewards, was great, and that their
enemies against their will did them service.

<span id="v.xii-p50"></span>[2 Cor.
6.10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010.md)<span id="v.xii-p50.1"></span>.
“As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.”

<span id="v.xii-p51"></span>For by those that are without, indeed, we
are suspected of being in despair; but we give no heed to them; yea, we
have our pleasure at the full <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) .
And he said not “rejoicing” only, but added also its perpetuity, for he
says “alway rejoicing.” What then can come up to this life? wherein,
although dangers so great assault, the joy becometh greater.

<span id="v.xii-p53"></span>“As poor, yet making many rich.”

<span id="v.xii-p54"></span>Some indeed affirm that the spiritual riches
are spoken of here; but I would say that the carnal are so too; for they
were rich in these also, having, after a new kind of manner, the houses
of all opened to them. And this too he signified by what follows,
saying,

<span id="v.xii-p55"></span>“As having nothing, and yet possessing all
things.”

<span id="v.xii-p56"></span>And how can this be? Yea rather, how can the
opposite be? For he that possesseth many things hath nothing; and he
that hath nothing possesseth the goods of all <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) . And not here only, but also in the
other points, contraries were produced by their contraries. But if thou
marvellest how it is possible for one that hath nothing to have all
things, let us bring forth this man himself into the midst, who
commanded the world and was lord not only of their substance, but of
their very eyes even. “If possible,” he says, “ye would have plucked out
your eyes, and have given them to me.” ([Gal. iv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015)<span id="v.xii-p57.3"></span>..md)

<span id="v.xii-p58"></span>Now these things he says, to instruct us not
to be disturbed at the opinions of the many, though they call us
deceivers, though they know us not, though they count us condemned <span
id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) , and appointed unto death, to be in
sorrow, to be in poverty, to have nothing, to be (us, who are in
cheerfulness) desponding: because that the sun even is not clear to the
blind, nor the pleasure of the sane intelligible <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) to the mad. For the faithful only are
right judges of these matters, and are not pleased and pained at the
same things as other people. For if any one who knew nothing of the
games were to see a boxer, having wounds upon him and wearing a crown;
he would think him in pain on account of the wounds, not understanding
the pleasure the crown would give him. And these therefore, because they
know what we suffer but do not know for what we suffer them, naturally
suspect that there is nought besides these; for they see indeed the
wrestling and the dangers, but not the prizes and the crowns and the
subject <span id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) of the contest. What
then were the “all things” which Paul possessed, when he said, “As
having nothing, and yet possessing all things?” Things temporal <span
id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) , things spiritual. For he whom the
cities received as an angel, for whom they would have plucked out their
own eyes and have given them to him, ([Gal.
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015)<span id="v.xii-p62.2"></span>..md) he
for whom they laid down their own necks, how had he not all things that
were theirs?  ([Rom. xvi. 4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.xii-p62.3"></span>.) But if thou desirest to see the spiritual
also, thou wilt find him in these things also especially rich. For he
that was so dear to the King of all as even to share in unspeakable
things with the Lord of the angels, ([2 Cor.
12.4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004)<span id="v.xii-p62.4"></span>..md)
how was not he more opulent than all men, and had all things? Devils had
not else been so subject to him, suffering and disease had not so fled
away <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) .

<span id="v.xii-p64"></span><span id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span
id="v.xii-Page_340"></span>\[5.\] And let us therefore, when we suffer
aught for Christ’s sake, not merely bear it nobly but also rejoice. If
we fast, let us leap for joy as if enjoying luxury; if we be insulted,
let us dance as if praised; if we spend, let us feel as if gaining; if
we bestow on the poor, let us count ourselves to receive: for he that
gives not thus will not give readily. When then thou hast a mind to
scatter abroad, look not at this only in almsgiving, but also in every
kind of virtue, compute not alone the severity of the toils, but also
the sweetness of the prizes; and before all the subjects of this
wrestling, our Lord Jesus; and thou wilt readily enter upon the contest,
and wilt live the whole time in pleasure. For nothing is wont so to
cause pleasure as a good conscience.

<span id="v.xii-p65"></span>Therefore Paul indeed, though wounded every
day, rejoiced and exulted; but the men of this day, although they endure
not a shadow even <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md) of what he
did, grieve and make lamentations from no other cause than that they
have not a mind full of heavenly philosophy. For, tell me, wherefore the
lamentation? Because thou art poor, and in want of necessaries?  Surely
for this thou oughtest rather to make lamentation, \[not\] <span
id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) because thou weepest, not because thou
art poor, but because thou art mean-spirited; not because thou hast not
money, but because thou prizest money so highly. Paul died daily, yet
wept not but even rejoiced; he fought with continual hunger, yet grieved
not but even gloried in it. And dost thou, because thou hast not all the
year’s provisions stored up, grieve and beat thyself?  ‘Yes,’ he
replies, ‘for he had to care only for his own needs, whilst I have
besides to care for servants, and children, and wife.’ Rather, he alone
had not to care for his own needs, but for the whole world’s. And thou
indeed \[hast to care\] for one household, but he for those so many poor
at Jerusalem, for those in Macedonia, for those everywhere in poverty,
for those who give to them no less than for those who receive. For his
care for the world was of a twofold nature, both that they might not be
destitute of necessaries, and that they might be rich in spiritual
things. And thy famishing children distress not thee so much as all the
concerns of the faithful did him. Why do I say, of the faithful? For
neither was he free from care for the unfaithful, but was so eaten up
with it that he wished even to become accursed for their sakes; but
thou, were a famine to rage ten thousand times over, wouldest never
choose to die for any whomsoever. And thou indeed carest for one woman,
but he for the Churches throughout the world. For he saith, “My anxiety
for all the Churches.” ([2 Cor.
11.28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028)<span id="v.xii-p67.2"></span>..md)
How long then, O man, dost thou trifle, comparing thyself with Paul; and
wilt not cease from this thy much meanness of spirit? For it behoveth to
weep, not when we are in poverty but when we sin; for this is worthy of
lamentations, as all the other things are of ridicule even. ‘But,’ he
saith, ‘this is not all that grieves me; but that also such an one is in
power, whilst I am unhonored and outcast.’ And what is this? for the
blessed Paul too appeared to the many to be unhonored and an outcast.
‘But,’ saith he, ‘he was Paul.’ Plainly then not the nature of the
things, but thy feebleness of spirit causeth thy desponding. Lament not
therefore thy poverty, but thyself who art so minded, yea rather, lament
not thyself, but reform thee; and seek not for money, but pursue that
which maketh men of more cheerful countenance than thousands of money,
philosophy and virtue. For where indeed these are, there is no harm in
poverty; and where these are not there is no good in money. For tell me,
what good is it when men are rich indeed, but have beggarly souls? Thou
dost not bewail thyself, so much as that rich man himself, because he
hath not the wealth of all. And if he doth not weep as thou dost, yet
lay open his conscience, and thou wilt see his wailings and
lamentations.

<span id="v.xii-p68"></span>Wilt thou that I show thee thine own riches,
that thou mayest cease to count them happy that are rich in money? Seest
thou this heaven here, the sun, this bright and far shining star, and
that gladdeneth our eyes, is not this too set out <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) common to all? and do not all enjoy it
equally, both poor and rich? And the wreath of the stars and the orb of
the moon, are they not left equally to all? Yea, rather, if I must speak
somewhat marvellous, we poor enjoy these more than they. For they indeed
being for the most part steeped in drunkenness, and passing their time
in revellings and deep sleep, do not even perceive these things, being
always under cover <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) and reared in
the shade <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) : but the poor do more
than any enjoy the luxury of these elements. And further, if thou wilt
look into the air which is every where diffused, thou wilt see the poor
man enjoying it in greater both freshness and abundance. For wayfarers
and husbandmen enjoy <span id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span
id="v.xii-Page_341"></span>these luxuries more than the inhabitants of
the city; and again, of those same inhabitants of the city, the
handicraftsmen more than those who are drunken all the day. What too of
the earth, is not this left common to all? ‘No,’ he saith. How sayest
thou so? tell me. ‘Because the rich man, even in the city, having gotten
himself several plethra, raises up long fences round them; and in the
country cuts off for himself many portions.’ What then?  When he cuts
them off, does he alone enjoy them? By no means, though he should
contend for it ever so earnestly. For the produce he is compelled to
distribute amongst all, and for thee he cultivates grain, and wine, and
oil, and every where ministers unto thee. And those long fences and
buildings, after his untold expense and his toils and drudgery he is
preparing for thy use, receiving from thee only a small piece of silver
for so great a service. And in baths and every where, one may see the
same thing obtaining; the rich of it all with perfect ease. And his
enjoyment of the earth is no more than thine; for sure he filleth not
ten stomachs, and thou only one. ‘But he partaketh of costlier meats?’
Truly, this is no mighty superiority; howbeit, even here, we shall find
thee to have the advantage. For this costliness is therefore thought by
thee a matter of envy because the pleasure with it is greater. Yet this
is greater in the poor man’s case; yet not pleasure only, but health
also; and in this alone is the advantage with the rich, that he maketh
his constitution feebler and collects more abundant fountains of
disease. For the poor man’s diet is all ordered according to nature, but
his through its excess resulteth in corruption and disease.

<span id="v.xii-p72"></span>\[6.\] But if ye will, let us also look at
this same thing in an example. For if it were requisite to light a
furnace, and then one man were to throw in silken garments and fine
linens, many and numberless, and so kindle it; and another logs of oak
and pine, what advantage would this man have over that? None, but even
disadvantage. But what? (for there is nothing to prevent our turning the
same illustration round after another manner,) if one were to throw in
logs, and another were to light his fire under bodies, by which furnace
wouldest thou like to stand, that with the logs, or that with the
bodies? Very plainly that with the logs. For that burns naturally and is
a pleasant spectacle to the beholders: whilst this with the steam, and
juices, and smoke, and the stench of the bones would drive every one
away. Didst thou shudder at the hearing, and loathe that furnace? Like
it are the bellies of the rich. For in them one would find more
rottenness than in that furnace, and stinking vapors, and filthy humors,
because that, all over in every part, indigestion abounds in consequence
of their surfeiting. For the natural heat not sufficing for the
digestion of the whole but being smothered under them, they lie smoking
above, and the unpleasantness produced is great. To what then should one
compare those stomachs of theirs? Yet do not be offended at what I say,
but if I do not say true things, refute me. To what then should one
compare them? for even what has been said is not enough to show their
wretched plight. I have found another resemblance yet. What then is it?
As in the sewers where there is accumulation of refuse, of dung, hay,
stubble, stones, clay, frequent stoppages occur; and then the stream of
filth overflows at top: so also it happeneth with the stomachs of those
people. For these being stopped up below, the greater part of these
villainous streams spurts up above. But not so with the poor, but like
those fountains which well forth pure streams, and water gardens and
pleasure grounds <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) , so also are
their stomachs pure from such-like superfluities. But not such are the
stomachs of the rich, or rather of the luxurious; but they are filled
with humors, phlegm, bile, corrupted blood, putrid rheums, and other
suchlike matters. Wherefore no one, if he lives always in luxury, can
bear it even for a short time; but his life will be spent in continual
sicknesses. Wherefore I would gladly ask them, for what end are meats
given? that we may be destroyed, or be nourished? that we may be
diseased, or be strong? that we may be healthful, or be sickly? Very
plainly, for nourishment, creating unto the body disease and sickness?
But not so the poor man; on the contrary, by his plain diet he purchases
to himself health, and vigor, and strength. Weep not then on account of
poverty, the mother of health, but even exult in it; and if thou
wouldest be rich, despise riches. For this, not the having money but the
not wanting to have it, is truly affluence. If we can achieve this, we
shall both be here more affluent than all that are rich, and there shall
obtain the good things to come, whereunto may all we attain, through the
grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the
Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.
