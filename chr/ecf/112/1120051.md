<span id="v.ii-p2"></span><span id="v.ii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.ii-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor.
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md),

<span id="v.ii-p3"></span>Whether we be afflicted, it is for your
comfort and salvation, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same
sufferings which we also suffer: and our hope for you is steadfast.

<span id="v.ii-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.ii-p4.1"></span>Having</span> spoken of one, and that the chief
ground of comfort and consolation, namely, having fellowship \[by
sufferings\] with Christ: he layeth down as second this which he now
mentions, namely, that the salvation of the disciples themselves was
procured thereby. “Faint not, therefore, he says, nor be confounded and
afraid because we are afflicted; for this same thing were rather a
reason for your being of good cheer: for had we not been afflicted, this
had been the ruin of you all.” How and wherein? For if through lack of
spirit <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) and fear of danger we had
not preached unto you the word whereby ye learned the true knowledge,
your situation had been desperate. Seest thou again the vehemence and
earnest contention <span id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) of Paul? The
very things which troubled them he uses for their comfort. For, saith
he, the greater the intensity of our persecutions, the greater should be
the increase of your good hope; because the more abundant also in
proportion is your salvation and consolation. For what hath equal force
of consolation with this of having obtained such good things through the
preaching. Then that he may not seem to be bringing <span
id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) the encomium round to himself alone,
see how he maketh them too to share these praises. For to the words,
“Whether we be afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation:” he
adds, “which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings
which we also suffer.” ([2 Cor.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007)<span id="v.ii-p7.2"></span>..md)
Afterwards, indeed, he states this more clearly, thus saying, “As ye are
partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the consolation;” but
here also meanwhile he alludes to it in the words, “the same
sufferings,” so making <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) what he
says include them. For what he saith is this, “Your salvation is not our
work alone, but your own as well; for both we in preaching to you the
word endure affliction, and ye in receiving it endure the very same; we
to impart to you that which we received, ye to receive what is imparted
and not to let it go.” Now what humility can compare with this, seeing
that those who fell so far short of him he raiseth to the same dignity
of endurance? for he saith, “Which worked in the enduring of the same
sufferings;” for not through believing only cometh your salvation, but
also through the suffering and enduring the same things with us. For
like as a pugilist <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) is an object
of admiration, when he doth but show himself and is in good training and
hath his skill within himself, but when he is in action <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) , enduring blows and striking his
adversary, then most of all shineth forth, because that then his good
training is most put in action <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) ,
and the proof of his skill evidently shown; so truly is your salvation
also then more especially put into action <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) , that is, is displayed, increased,
heightened, when it hath endurance, when it suffereth and beareth all
things nobly. So then the work <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md)
of salvation consisteth not in doing evil, but in suffering evil.
Moreover he saith not, “which worketh,” but, “which is wrought <span
id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) ,” to show that together with their
own willingness of mind, grace also which wrought in them did contribute
much.

<span id="v.ii-p15"></span>[2 Cor.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007.md)<span id="v.ii-p15.1"></span>. “And
our hope for you is steadfast.” That is, though ye should suffer ills
innumerable, we are confident that ye will not turn round <span
id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) , either upon your own trials or upon
our persecutions. For so far are we from suspecting you of being
confounded on account of our sufferings that even when yourselves are in
peril, we are then confident concerning you.

<span id="v.ii-p17"></span>\[2.\] Seest thou how great had been their
advance since the former Epistle? For he hath here witnessed of them far
greater things than of the Macedonians, whom throughout that Epistle he
extolleth and commendeth. For on their \[the Macedonians’\] account he
feared <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_278"></span>and saith, “We sent,” unto you, “Timothy…to
establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith, that no man be
moved by these afflictions, for yourselves know that hereunto we are
appointed.” ([1 Thess. 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003)<span id="v.ii-p17.1"></span>..md) And
again: “For this cause when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
your faith, lest by any means the tempter hath tempted you: and our
labor should be in vain.” ([2 Cor.
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005)<span id="v.ii-p17.2"></span>..md) But
of these \[the Corinthians\] he saith nothing of this kind, but quite
the contrary, “Our hope for you is steadfast.”

<span id="v.ii-p18"></span>[2 Cor.
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007.md)<span id="v.ii-p18.1"></span>. “Or
whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
Knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of
the comfort.”

<span id="v.ii-p19"></span>That for their sakes the Apostles were
afflicted, he showed when he said, “whether we be afflicted, it is for
your consolation and salvation:” he wishes also to show that for their
sakes also they were comforted. He said this indeed even a little above,
although somewhat generally <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) ,
thus; “Blessed be God, Who comforteth us in all our afflictions, that we
may be able to comfort them which are in any affliction.” He repeats it
here too in other words more clearly and more <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) home to their needs. “For whether we
be comforted,” says he, “it is for your comfort.” What he means is this;
our comfort becometh your refreshment, even though we should not comfort
you by word. If we be but a little refreshed, this availeth for
encouragement to you; and if we be ourselves comforted, this becometh
your comfort. For as ye consider our sufferings your own, so do ye also
make our comfort your own. For surely it cannot be that, when ye share
in worse fortune with us, ye will not share in the better. If then ye
share in everything, as in tribulation so in comfort, ye will in no wise
blame us for this delay and slowness in coming, because that both for
your sakes we are in tribulation and for your sakes in comfort. For lest
any should think this a hard saying, “for your sakes we thus suffer,” he
adds, “for your sakes also we are comforted,” and “not we alone are in
peril; for ye also,” saith he, “are partakers of the same sufferings.”
Thus then, by admitting them to be partakers in the perils and ascribing
to them the cause of their own comfort, he softeneth what he saith. If
then we be beset by craft <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md) , be
of good cheer; we endure this that your faith may grow in strength. And
if we be comforted, glory <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) in
this also; for we enjoy this too for your sakes, that thereby ye may
receive some encouragement by sharing in our joy. And that the comfort
he here speaks of is that which they <span
id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) enjoyed not only from being comforted
by themselves, (the Apostles) but also from knowing them (the Apostles)
to be at rest, hear him declaring in what follows next, “Knowing that as
ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.” For
as when we suffer persecution, ye are in distress as though yourselves
so suffering; so are we sure that when we are comforted, ye think the
enjoyment also your own. What more humble-minded than this spirit? He
who so greatly surpasseth in perils, calleth them “partakers,” who
endured no part of them whatever <span id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md)
; whilst of the comfort he ascribeth the whole cause to them, not to his
own labors.

<span id="v.ii-p26"></span>\[3.\] Next, having spoken before only
generally of troubles, he now maketh mention of the place too where they
(Ben. he) endured them.

<span id="v.ii-p27"></span>[2 Cor.
1.8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008.md)<span id="v.ii-p27.1"></span>  “For
we would not, Brethren, have you ignorant concerning our affliction
which befell us in Asia.”

<span id="v.ii-p28"></span>“These things we speak,” saith he, “that ye
may not be ignorant of what befell us; for we wish, yea have earnestly
endeavored, that ye should know our affairs:” which is a very high proof
of love. Of this even in the former Epistle he had before given notice,
where he said, “For a great door and effectual is opened to me at
Ephesus, and there are many adversaries.” ([1 Cor.
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009)<span id="v.ii-p28.1"></span>..md)
Putting them then in mind of this, and recounting how much he suffered,
he saith, “I would not have you ignorant of our affliction which befell
us in Asia.” And in his Epistle to the Ephesians too he said the same.
For having sent Tychicus to them, he gives this as the reason of his
journey: whence he saith, “But that ye also may know my affairs, and how
I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord,
shall make known to you all things; whom I have sent unto you for this
very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your
hearts.” ([Eph. 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022)<span id="v.ii-p28.2"></span>..md) And
in other Epistles also he doeth the very same. Nor is it superfluous,
but even exceedingly necessary: both because of his exceeding affection
for the disciples, and because of their continued trials; wherein the
knowledge of each other’s fortunes was a very great comfort; so that if
these were calamitous, they might be prepared both to be energetic and
to be safer against falling; or if these were good, they might rejoice
with them. He here, however, speaketh as well of being delivered from
trials as of being assaulted by them, saying, “We were weighed down
exceedingly, beyond <span id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_279"></span>our power.” Like a vessel sinking <span
id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) under some mighty burden. He may seem
to have said, only one thing here “exceedingly” and “beyond our power:”
it is, however, not one but two; for lest one should object, “What then?
granting the peril were exceeding, yet it was not great to you;” he
added, it both was great and surpassed our strength, yea, so surpassed
it, “That we despaired even of life.”

<span id="v.ii-p30"></span>That is, we had no longer any expectation of
living. What David calleth “the gates of hell, the pangs” and “the
shadow of death,” this he expresseth by saying, “We endured peril
pregnant with certain death.”

<span id="v.ii-p31"></span>[2 Cor.
1.9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md)<span id="v.ii-p31.1"></span>. “But
we had the answer of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in
ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead.”

<span id="v.ii-p32"></span>What is this, “the answer of death?” <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md)   The vote, the judgment, the
expectation. For so spake our affairs; our fortunes gave this answer,
“We shall surely die.”

<span id="v.ii-p35"></span>To be sure, this did not come to the proof,
but only as far as to our anticipations, and stopped there: for the
nature of our affairs did so declare, yet the power of God allowed not
the declaration to take effect, but permitted it to happen only in our
thought and in expectation: wherefore he saith, “We had the answer of
death in ourselves,” not in fact. <span
id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md)   And wherefore permitted He peril so
great as to take away our hope and cause us to despair? “That we should
not trust in ourselves,” saith he, “but in God.” These words Paul said,
not that this was his own temper. Away with such a thought, but as
attuning <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md) the rest by what he
saith of himself, and in his great care to speak modestly. Whence also
further on he saith, “There was given to me a thorn in the flesh,
(meaning his trials,) lest I should be exalted overmuch.” ([2 Cor. xii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007)<span id="v.ii-p37.3"></span>..md) And
yet God doth not say that He permitted them for this, but for another
reason. What other? That His strength might be the more displayed;
“For,” saith he, “My grace is sufficient for thee, for My power is made
perfect in weakness.” ([2 Cor.
1.9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009)<span id="v.ii-p37.4"></span>..md)
But, as I said, he no where forgetteth his own peculiar character,
classing himself with those who fall short exceedingly and stand in need
of much discipline and correction. For if one or two trials suffice to
sober even ordinary men, how should he who of all men had most
cultivated lowliness of mind his whole life long and had suffered as no
other man did, after so many years and a practice of wisdom <span
id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md) worthy of the heavens, be in need of
this admonition? Whence it is plain that here too, it is from modesty
and to calm down those who thought highly of themselves and boasted,
that he thus speaks, “That we should not trust in ourselves, but in
God.”

<span id="v.ii-p39"></span>\[4.\] And observe how he treateth them
tenderly <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) here also. For, saith
he, these trials were permitted to come upon us for your sakes; of so
great price <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) are ye in God’s
sight; for “whether we be afflicted,” saith he, “it is for your
consolation and salvation;” but they were “out of measure” for our sake,
lest we should be high minded. “For we were weighed down exceedingly,
beyond our power, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God that
raiseth the dead.” He again putteth them in mind of the doctrine of the
Resurrection whereon he said so much in the former Epistle, and
confirmeth it from the present circumstance; whence he added,

<span id="v.ii-p42"></span>[2 Cor.
1.10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010.md)<span id="v.ii-p42.1"></span>.
“Who delivered us out of so great deaths. <span
id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) ”

<span id="v.ii-p44"></span>He said not, “from so great dangers,” at once
showing the insupportable severity of the trials, and confirming the
doctrine I have mentioned. For whereas the Resurrection was a thing
future, he showeth that it happeneth every day: for when \[God\] lifteth
up again a man who is despaired of and hath been brought to the very
gates of Hades, He showeth none other thing than a resurrection,
snatching out of the very jaws of death him that had fallen into them:
whence in the case of those despaired of and then restored either out of
grievous sickness or insupportable trials, it is an ordinary way of
speaking to say, We have seen a resurrection of the dead in his case.

<span id="v.ii-p45"></span>[2 Cor.
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011.md)<span id="v.ii-p45.1"></span>. “And
we have set our hope that He will also still deliver us; ye also helping
together on our behalf by your supplication, that for the gift bestowed
upon us by the means <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_280"></span>of many <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) , thanks may be given by many persons
on our behalf.”

<span id="v.ii-p47"></span>Since the words, “that we should not trust in
ourselves,” might seem to be a common charge and an accusation that
pointed to some amongst them; he softeneth <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) again what he said, by calling their
prayers a great protection and at the same time showing that \[this\]
our life must be throughout a scene of conflict <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) . For in those words, “And we have set
our hope that He will also still deliver us,” he predicts a future
sleet <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) of many trials: but still
no where aught of being forsaken, but of succor again and support. Then,
lest on hearing that they were to be continually in perils they should
be cast down, he showed before the use of perils; for instance, “that we
should not trust in ourselves;” that is, that he may keep us in
continual humility, and that their salvation may be wrought; and many
other uses besides; the being partakers with Christ; (“for,” saith he,
“the sufferings of Christ abound in us;”) the suffering for the
faithful; (“for,” saith he, “whether we be afflicted, it is for your
comfort and salvation;”) the superior lustre this last (i.e., their
salvation) should shine with <span id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) ;
“which,” saith he, “worketh” \[in you\] “in the patient enduring of the
same sufferings;” their being made hardy; and besides all these, that of
seeing the resurrection vividly portrayed before their eyes:  for, “He
hath delivered us out of so great death;” being of an earnest mind and
ever looking unto Him, “for,” saith he, “we have set our hope that he
will deliver” us; its rivetting <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md)
them to prayers, for he saith, “ye also helping together on our behalf
by your supplication.” Thus having shown the gain of affliction and then
having made them energetic: he anointeth once more their spirits \[for
the combat\], and animates them to virtue by witnessing great things of
their prayers, for that to these God had granted <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) Paul; as he saith, “Ye helping
together on our behalf by prayer.” But what is this: “That for the gift
bestowed upon us by means of many <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) , thanks may be given by many on our
behalf? He delivered us from those deaths,” saith he, “ye also helping
together by prayer;” that is, praying all of you for us. For “the gift
bestowed upon us,” that is, our being saved, He was pleased to grant to
you all, in order that many persons might give Him thanks, because that
many also received the boon.

<span id="v.ii-p55"></span>\[5.\] And this he said, at once to stir them
up to prayer for others, and to accustom them always to give thanks to
God for whatever befalleth others, showing that He too willeth this
exceedingly. For they that are careful to do both these for others, will
much more for themselves show an example of both. And besides this, he
both teacheth them humility and leadeth on to more fervent love. For if
he who was so high above them owneth himself to have been saved by their
prayers: and that to their prayers himself <span
id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) had been granted as a boon of God,
think what their modesty and disposition ought to have been. And
observe, I pray you, this also; that even if God doeth any thing in
mercy, yet prayer doth mightily contribute thereunto. For at the first
he attributed his salvation to His mercies; for “The God of mercies,” he
says, Himself “delivered us,” but here to the prayers also. For on him
too that owed the ten thousand talents He had mercy after that he fell
at His feet; ([Matt. 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#024.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#027)<span id="v.ii-p56.2"></span>..md)
although it is written, that “being moved with compassion, He loosed
him.” And again to the “woman of Canaan,” it was after that long
attendance and importunity <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) of
hers, ([Matt. xv. 22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.ii-p57.2"></span>.) that He finally granted the healing of her
daughter, even though of His mercy He healed her. Hereby then we learn
that even though we are to receive mercy, we must first make ourselves
worthy of the mercy; for though there be mercy, yet it seeketh out those
that are worthy. It will not come upon all without distinction; those
even who have no feeling; for He saith, “I will have mercy on whom I
have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
([Rom. ix. 15](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.ii-p57.3"></span>.) Observe at least what he saith here, “Ye also
helping together by prayer.” He hath neither ascribed the whole of the
good work to them lest he should lift them up, nor yet deprived them of
all share whatever in it, in order to encourage them and animate their
zeal, and bring them together one to another. Whence also he said, “He
also granted to you my safety.” For ofttimes also God is abashed <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) by a multitude praying with one mind
and mouth. Whence also He said to the prophet, “And shall not I spare
this city wherein dwell more than six score thousand persons?” ([Jonah
iv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011)<span id="v.ii-p58.2"></span>..md)
Then lest thou think He respecteth the multitude only, He saith, “Though
the number of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be
saved.” ([Isa. x. 22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.ii-p58.3"></span>.) How then saved He the Ninevites? Because in
their case, there was not <span id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_281"></span>only a multitude, but a multitude and virtue
too. For each one “turned from” his “evil way.” ([Jonah
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010.md), [Jonah
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011)<span id="v.ii-p58.4"></span>..md)
And besides, when He saved them, He said that they discerned not
“between their right hand and their left hand:” whence it is plain that
even before, they sinned more out of simpleness than of wickedness: it
is plain too from their being converted, as they were, by hearing a few
words. But if their being six score thousand were of itself enough to
save them, what hindered even before this that they should be saved? And
why saith He not to the Prophet, And shall I not spare this city which
so turneth itself? but bringeth forward the score thousands. He
produceth this also as a reason over and above. For that they had turned
was known to the prophet, but he knew not either their numbers or their
simpleness. So by every possible consideration he is desirous to soften
them. For even greatness of number hath power, when there is virtue
withal. And truly the Scripture elsewhere also showeth this plainly,
where it saith, “But prayer was made earnestly of the Church unto God
for him:” ([Acts xii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.ii-p58.5"></span>.) and so great power had it, even when the doors
were shut and chains lay on him and keepers were sleeping by on either
side, that it led the Apostle forth and delivered him from them all. But
as where there is virtue, greatness of number hath mighty power; so
where wickedness is, it profiteth nothing. For the Israelites of whom He
saith that the number of them was as the sand of the sea, perished every
one, and those too in the days of Noe were both many, yea, numberless;
and yet this profited them nothing. For greatness of number hath no
power of itself, but only as an adjunct <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) .

<span id="v.ii-p60"></span>\[6.\] Let us then be diligent in coming
together in supplication; and let us pray for one another, as they did
for the Apostles. For \[so\] we both fulfil a commandment, and are
“anointed <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) ” unto love: (and when
I say love, I speak of every good thing:)  and also learn <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) to give thanks with more earnestness:
for they that give thanks for the things of others, much more will they
for their own. This also was David wont to do, saying, “Magnify the Lord
with me, and let us exalt His name together;” ([Ps. xxxiv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#003)<span id="v.ii-p62.1"></span>..md) this
the Apostle too doth every where require. This let us too labor in; and
let us show forth unto all the beneficence of God that we may get
companions in the act of praise: for if when we have received any good
from men, by proclaiming it forth we make them the readier to serve us:
much more shall we, by telling abroad the benefits of God, draw Him on
to more good-will. And if when we have received benefits of men we stir
up others also to join us in the giving of thanks, much more ought we to
bring many unto God who may give thanks for us. For if Paul who had so
great confidence \[toward God\] doth this, much more is it necessary for
us to do it. Let us then exhort the saints to give thanks for us; and
let us do the same ourselves for one another. To priests especially this
good work belongs, since it is an exceeding privilege <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) . For drawing near, we first give
thanks for the whole world and the good things common \[to all\]. For
even though the blessings of God be common, yet doth the common
preservation <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) include thine own;
so that thou both owest common thanksgivings for thine own
peculiar <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) blessing, and for the
common blessings shouldest of right render up thine own peculiar <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) praise:  for He lighted up the sun not
for thee alone, but also for all in common; but nevertheless thou for
thy part hast it whole <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) . For it
was made so large for the common good; and yet thou individually seest
it as large as all men have seen it; so that thou owest a thanksgiving
as great as all together; and thou oughtest to give thanks for what all
have in common and likewise for the virtue of others; for on account of
others, too, we receive many blessings:  for had there been found in
Sodom ten righteous only, they had not suffered what they did. So then
let us give thanks also for the confidence of others \[toward God\]. For
this custom is an ancient one, planted in the Church from the beginning.
Thus Paul also giveth thanks for the Romans, ([Rom. i.
8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008)<span id="v.ii-p67.2"></span>..md) for
the Corinthians, ([1 Cor. i. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.ii-p67.3"></span>.) for the whole world, ([1 Tim. ii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001)<span id="v.ii-p67.4"></span>..md) And
tell me not, “The good work is none of mine;” for though it be none of
thine, yet even so oughtest thou to give thanks that thy member is such
an one. And besides, by thy acclamation thou makest it thine own, and
sharest in the crown, and shalt thyself also receive the gift. On this
account it is that the laws of the Church <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) command prayer also to be thus made,
and that not for the faithful only, but also for the Catechumens. For
the law stirreth up the faithful to make supplication for the
uninitiated <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) . For when the
Deacon saith <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) , “Let us pray
earnestly for the <span id="page_282">p. 282</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_282"></span>Catechumens,” he doth no other than excite the
whole multitude of the faithful to pray for them; although the
Catechumens are as yet aliens. For they are not yet of the Body of
Christ, they have not yet partaken of the Mysteries, but are still
divided from the spiritual flock. But if we ought to intercede for
these, much more for our own members. And even therefore he saith,
“earnestly let us pray,” that thou shouldest not disown them as aliens,
that thou shouldest not disregard them as strangers. For as yet they
have not the appointed <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) prayer,
which Christ brought in; as yet they have not confidence, but have need
of others’ aid who have been initiated. For without the king’s courts
they stand, far from the sacred precincts <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) . Therefore they are even driven away
whilst those awful prayers are being offered. Therefore also he
exhorteth thee to pray for them that they may become members of thee,
that they may be no longer strangers and aliens. For the words, “Let us
pray,” are not addressed to the priests alone, but also to those that
make up the people: for when he saith, “Let us stand in order <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) : let us pray;” he exhorteth all to
the prayer.

<span id="v.ii-p85"></span>\[7.\] Then beginning the prayer, he saith,
“That the all-pitying and merciful God would listen to their prayers.”
For that thou mayest not say, What shall we pray? they are aliens, not
yet united \[to the body\]. Whereby can I constrain <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) the regard of God? Whence can I
prevail with Him to impart unto them mercy and forgiveness? That thou
mayest not be perplexed with such questions as these, see how he
disentangleth thy perplexity, saying, “that the all-pitying and merciful
God.” Heardest thou? “All-pitying God.” Be perplexed no more. For the
All-pitying pitieth all, both sinners and friends. Say not then, “How
shall I approach Him for them?” Himself will listen to their prayers.
And the Catechumens’ prayer, what can it be but that they may not remain
Catechumens? Next, he suggesteth also the manner of the prayer. And what
is this? “That He would open the ears of their hearts;” for they are as
yet shut and stopped up. “Ears,” he saith, not these which be outward,
but those of the understanding, “so as to hear ‘the things which eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) into the heart of man.’” ([1 Cor.
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md), [Isa.
54:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004)<span id="v.ii-p87.3"></span>..md)
For they have not heard the untold mysteries; but they stand somewhere
at a distance and far off from them; and even if they should hear, they
know not what is said; for those \[mysteries\] need much understanding,
not hearing only: and the inward ears as yet they have not: wherefore
also he next invoketh for them a Prophet’s gift, for the Prophet spoke
on this wise; “God giveth me the tongue of instruction, that I should
know how to speak a word in season; for He opened my mouth; He gave to
me betimes in the morning; He granted me a hearing ear.” ([Is. i.
4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004)<span id="v.ii-p87.4"></span>. Sept..md)
For as the Prophets heard otherwise than the many, so also do the
faithful than the Catechumens. Hereby the Catechumen also is taught not
to learn to hear these things of men, (for He saith, “Call no man master
upon the earth <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) , but from above,
from heaven, “For they shall be all taught of God.” ([Is. liv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013)<span id="v.ii-p88.3"></span>..md)

<span id="v.ii-p89"></span>Wherefore he says, “And instil <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) into them the word of truth,” so that
it may be inwardly learned <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) ; for
as yet they know not the word of truth as they ought to know. “That He
would sow His fear in them.” But this is not enough; for “some fell by
the wayside, and some upon the rock.” But we ask not thus; but as on
<span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span id="v.ii-Page_283"></span>rich
soil the plough openeth the furrows, so we pray it may be here also,
that having the fallow ground of their minds <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) tilled deep, they may receive what is
dropped upon them and accurately retain everything they have heard.
Whence also he adds, “And confirm His faith in their minds;” that is,
that it may not lie on the surface, but strike its root deep downwards.
“That He would unveil to them the Gospel of Righteousness.” He showeth
that the veil is two-fold, partly that the eyes of their understanding
were shut, partly that the Gospel was hidden from them. Whence he said a
little above, “that He would open the ears of their hearts,” and here,
“that he would unveil unto them the Gospel of Righteousness;” that is,
both that He would render them wise and apt for receiving <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) seed, and that He would teach them and
drop the seed into them; for though they should be apt, yet if God
reveal not, this profiteth nothing; and if God should unveil but they
receive not, there resulteth like unprofitableness.  Therefore we ask
for both: that He would both open their hearts and unveil the Gospel.
For neither if kingly ornaments lie underneath a veil, will it profit at
all that the eyes be looking; nor yet that they be laid bare, if the
eyes be not waking <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) . But both
will be granted, if first they <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md)
themselves desire it. But what then is “the Gospel of Righteousness?”
That which maketh righteous. By these words he leadeth them to the
desire of Baptism, showing that the Gospel is for the working <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) not only of the remission of sins, but
also of righteousness.

<span id="v.ii-p97"></span>\[8.\] “That He would grant to them a godly
mind, sound judgment, and virtuous manner of life <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) .” Let such of the faithful attend as
are rivetted <span id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) to the things of
\[this\] life. For if we are bidden to ask these things for the
uninitiated: think in what things we ought to be occupied who ask these
things for others. For the manner of life ought to keep pace with <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) the Gospel. Whence surely also the
order of the prayer <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) shifts from
the doctrines \[of the Gospel\] to the deportment: for to the words,
“that He would unveil to them the Gospel of Righteousness;” it hath
added, “that He would give unto them a Godly mind.” And what is this
“Godly?” That God may dwell in it. For He saith, “I will dwell in them,
and walk in them;” ([Lev. xxvi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012)<span id="v.ii-p101.2"></span>..md) for
when the mind is become righteous, when it hath put off its sins, it
becometh God’s dwelling. ([Rom. vi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016)<span id="v.ii-p101.3"></span>..md) But
when God indwelleth, nothing of man will be left. And thus doth the mind
become Godly, speaking every word from Him, even as in truth an house of
God dwelling in it. Surely then the filthy in speech hath not a Godly
mind, nor he who delighteth in jesting and laughter.

<span id="v.ii-p102"></span>“Sound judgment.” And what can it be to have
“a sound judgment?” To enjoy the health that pertaineth to the soul: for
he that is held down by wicked lusts and dazzled <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) with present things, never can be
sound, that is, healthy. But as one who is diseased lusteth even after
things which are unfit for him, so also doth he. “And a virtuous mode of
life,” for the doctrines need a mode of life \[answerable\]. Attend to
this, ye who come to baptism at the close of life, for we indeed pray
that after baptism ye may have also this deportment, but thou art
seeking and doing thy utmost to depart without it. For, what though thou
be justified <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) : yet is it of
faith only. But we pray that thou shouldest have as well the confidence
that cometh of good works.

<span id="v.ii-p105"></span>“Continually to think those things which be
His, to mind those things which be His, to practise <span
id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) those things which be His:” for we ask
not to have sound judgment and virtuous deportment for one day only, or
for two or three, but through the whole tenor and period <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) of our life; and as the foundation of
all good things, “to mind those things which be His.” For the many “seek
their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.” ([Philip. ii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021)<span id="v.ii-p107.2"></span>..md) How
then might this be? (For besides prayer, need is that we contribute also
our own endeavors.) If we be <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md)
occupied in His law day and night. Whence he goeth on to ask this also,
“to be occupied in His law;” and as he said above, “continually,” so
here “day and night.” Wherefore I even blush for these who scarce once
in the year are seen in church. For what excuse can they have who are
bidden not simply “day and night” to commune with the law but “to be
occupied in,” that is, to be for ever holding converse with it <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) , and yet scarce do so for the
smallest fraction of their life?

<span id="v.ii-p110"></span>“To remember His commandments, to keep His
judgments.” Seest thou what an excellent chain is here? and how each
link hangs by the next compacted with more strength and beauty than any
chain of gold? For having asked for a Godly mind, he telleth whereby
this may be produced. Whereby? By continually practising <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) it. And how might this be brought
about? <span id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_284"></span>By constantly giving heed to the Law. And how
might men be persuaded to this? If they should keep His Commandments:
yea rather, from giving heed to the law cometh also the keeping His
Commandments; as likewise from minding the things which be His and from
having a Godly mind, cometh the practising the things which be His. For
each of the things mentioned jointly <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) procureth and is procured by the next,
both linking it and being linked by it.

<span id="v.ii-p113"></span>\[9.\] “Let us beseech for them yet more
earnestly.” For since by length of speaking the soul useth to grow
drowsy, he again arouseth it up, for he purposeth to ask again certain
great and lofty things. Wherefore he saith, “Let us beseech for them yet
more earnestly.” And what is this?  “That He would deliver them from
every evil and inordinate <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md)
thing.” Here we ask for them that they may not enter into temptation,
but be delivered from every snare, a deliverance as well bodily as
spiritual <span id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) . Wherefore also he
goeth on to say, “from every devilish sin and from every <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) besetment of the adversary,” meaning,
temptations and sins. For sin doth easily beset, taking its stand on
every side, before, behind, and so casting down. For, after telling us
what ought to be done by us, namely, to be occupied in His law, to
remember His Commandments, to keep His judgments, he assures us next
that not even is this enough, except Himself stand by and succor. For,
“Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it;”
([Ps. cxxvii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.ii-p116.2"></span>.) and especially in the case of those who are
yet exposed to the devil and are under his dominion. And ye that are
initiated know this well. For call to mind, for instance, those words
wherein ye renounced <span id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) his
usurped <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) rule, and bent the knee
and deserted to The King, and uttered those awful <span
id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) words whereby we are taught in nothing
whatever to obey him. But he calleth him adversary and accuser, because
he both accuseth God to man and us to God, and us again one to another.
For at one time he accused Job to God, saying, “Doth Job serve the Lord
for nought?” ([Job i. 9](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.ii-p119.2"></span>. LXX. ver. 16.) at another time God to Job,
“Fire came down from heaven.” And again, God to Adam, ([Gen. iii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#005)<span id="v.ii-p119.3"></span>..md) when
He said their eyes would be opened. And to many men at this day, saying,
that God taketh no care for the visible order of things, but hath
delegated your affairs to demons <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md)
. And to many of the Jews he accused Christ, calling Him a deceiver and
a sorcerer. But perchance some one wisheth to hear in what manner he
worketh. When he findeth not a godly mind, findeth not a sound
understanding, then, as into a soul left empty, he leads his revel
thither <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) ; when one remembereth
not the commandments of God nor keepeth His judgments, then he taketh
him captive and departeth. Had Adam, for instance, remembered the
commandment which said, “Of every tree thou mayest eat:” ([Gen. ii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#016)<span id="v.ii-p121.4"></span>..md) had
he kept the judgment which said, “In the day in which ye eat thereof,
then <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md) shall ye surely die;” it
had not fared with him as it did.

<span id="v.ii-p123"></span>“That He would count them worthy in due
season of the regeneration of the laver, of the remission of sins.” For
we ask some things to come now, some to come hereafter; and we expound
the doctrine <span id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) of the laver, and
in asking instruct them to know its power. For what is said thenceforth
familiarizes them to know already that what is there done is a
regeneration, and that we are born again of the waters, just as of the
womb; that they say not after Nicodemus, “How <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) can one be born when he is old!  Can
he enter into his mother’s womb, and be born again?” Then, because he
had spoken of “remission of sins,” he confirmeth this by the words next
following, “of the clothing of incorruption;” for he that putteth on
sonship plainly becometh incorruptible. But what is that “in due
season?” When any is well disposed, when any cometh thereunto with
earnestness and faith; for this is the “due season” of the believer.

<span id="v.ii-p126"></span>\[10.\] “That He would bless their coming in
and their going out, the whole course of their life.” Here they are
directed to ask even for some bodily good, as being yet somewhat weak.
“Their houses and their households,” that is, if they have servants or
kinsfolk or any others belonging to them. For these were the rewards of
the old Covenant; and nothing then was feared so much as widowhood,
childlessness, untimely mournings, to be visited with famine, to have
their affairs go on unprosperously. And hence it is, that he alloweth
these also fondly <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) to linger over
petitions rather material <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) ,
making them mount by little and little to higher things. For so too doth
Christ; so too doth Paul, making mention of the ancient blessings:
Christ, when He saith, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the
earth;” Paul, when he saith, <span id="page_285">p. 285</span> <span
id="v.ii-Page_285"></span>“Honor thy father and thy mother.…and thou
shalt live long on the earth.” “That He would increase their children
and bless them, and bring them to full age, and teach <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) them wisdom.” Here again is both a
bodily and spiritual thing, as for persons yet but too much babes in
disposition. Then what follows is altogether spiritual, “that He would
direct all that is before them <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md)
unto good;” for he saith not simply, “all that is before them,” but,
“all that is before them unto good.” For often a journey is before a
man, but it is not good; or some other such thing, which is not
profitable. Hereby they are taught in every thing to give thanks to God,
as happening for good. After all this, he bids them stand up during what
follows. For having before cast them to the ground, when they have asked
what they have asked and have been filled with confidence, now the
word <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) given raiseth them up, and
biddeth them during what follows engage for themselves also in
supplication to God. For part we say ourselves, and part we permit them
to say, now opening unto them the door of prayer, (exactly as we first
teach children \[what to say\], and then bid them say it of themselves,)
saying, “Pray ye, Catechumens, for the angel of peace;” for there is an
angel that punisheth, as when He saith, “A band of evil angels,” ([Ps.
lxxviii. 49](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049.md)<span
id="v.ii-p131.2"></span>.) there is that destroyeth. Wherefore we bid
them ask for the angel of peace, teaching them to seek that which is the
bond of all good things, peace; so that they may be delivered from all
fightings, all wars, all seditions. “That all that is before you may be
peaceful;” for even if a thing be burdensome, if a man have peace, it is
light. Wherefore Christ also said, “My peace I give unto you” (<span
id="v.ii-p131.3"></span>John  xiv. 27.) for the devil hath no weapon so
strong as fighting, and enmity, and war. “Pray that this day and all the
days of your life be full <span id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) of
peace.” Seest thou how he again insisteth that the whole life be passed
in virtue? “That your ends be Christian;” your highest good, the
honorable and the expedient <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) ;
for what is not honorable is not expedient either. For our idea of the
nature of expediency is different from that of the many. “Commend
yourselves to the living God and to His Christ;” for as yet we trust
them not to pray for others, but it is sufficient <span
id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) to be able to pray for themselves.

<span id="v.ii-p135"></span>Seest thou the completeness of this prayer,
both in regard of doctrine and of behavior? for when we have mentioned
the Gospel and the clothing of incorruption and the Laver of
Regeneration, we have mentioned all the doctrines: when again we spoke
of a Godly mind, a sound understanding, and the rest of what we said, we
suggested <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) the mode of life. Then
we bid them <span id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) bow their heads;
regarding it as a proof of their prayers being heard that God blessed
them. For surely it is not a man that blesseth; but by means of his hand
and his tongue we bring unto the King Himself the heads of those that
are present. And all together shout the “Amen.”

<span id="v.ii-p138"></span>Now why have I said all this? To teach you
that we ought to seek the things of others, that the faithful may not
think it no concern of theirs when these things are said. For not to the
walls surely doth the Deacon say, “Let us pray for the Catechumens.” But
some are so without understanding, so stupid, so depraved <span
id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) , as to stand and talk not only during
the time of the Catechumens, but also during the time of the faithful.
Hence all is perverted; hence all is utterly lost: for at the very time
when we ought most to propitiate God, we go away having provoked Him. So
again in \[the prayers of\] the faithful <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) , we are bidden to approach the God
that loveth men, for Bishops, for Priests, for Kings, for those in
authority, for earth and sea, for the seasons <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) , for the whole world. When then we
who ought to have such boldness as to pray for others, are scarce awake
even whilst praying for ourselves, how can we excuse ourselves? how find
pardon? Wherefore I beseech you that laying all this to heart, ye would
know the time of prayer, and be lifted up and disengaged from earth, and
touch the vault itself of heaven; so that we may have power to make God
propitious and obtain the good things promised, whereunto may we all
attain, through the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ;
with Whom unto the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be glory,
might, honor, now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.

<span id="v.ii-p33"></span> \[This is the rendering of <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii-p33.1"></span> ἀπόκριμα</span> in the
Revised Version, but the American Committee prefer to retain “sentence”
of the common version, adding in the margin “Gr. answer.” But it seems
better to adhere to the view of the British Revisers, since this is the
natural meaning of the term, (Prof. Thayer in his edition of Grimm gives
no other), and besides, adds greatly to the vivacity of the Apostle’s
utterance. Again and again he was compelled to ask the question what
would be the end of the perils by which he was surrounded, but the
answer invariably was Death. This being the case he was permanently
driven out of any self-trust, and compelled to rely upon God “who
raiseth the dead,” and who therefore could easily deliver his servants
even when at the point to die. It is true that there is no such thing as
implicit confidence in God until men renounce all confidence in
themselves.

<span id="v.ii-p34"></span>There are different opinions as to the nature
of the terrible peril to which the Apostle was exposed in Asia. Some
have suggested the uproar in Ephesus mentioned in [Acts xix.
23-41](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023.md)<span id="v.ii-p34.1"></span>,
others a severe illness, others a dangerous shipwreck, others (Rev. Jos.
Waite in *Bible Commentary*) his devouring anxiety about Corinthian
affairs. It does not seem necessary to be able to determine this matter
precisely. The probability is that he refers to trials of different
kinds, and especially to plots and attempts against his life. He could
hardly use stronger language than he does to set forth the desperate
straits in which he was. “Weighed down exceedingly,” “beyond our power,”
“we despaired even of life.” Chrysostom well points out and enforces the
lessons to be drawn from the extraordinary experience of this eminent
servant of God. C.\]

<span id="v.ii-p70"></span> The whole Prayer for the Catechumens, as
gathered from the Homily, will stand thus. “Let us pray earnestly for
the Catechumens, That the all-pitying and merciful God would listen to
their prayers, that He would open the ears of their hearts and instil
into them the word of truth, that He would sow His fear in them and
confirm His faith in their minds, that He would unveil to them the
Gospel of righteousness, that He would grant to them a godly mind, sound
judgment, and virtuous manner of life; continually to think those things
which be His, to mind those things which be His, to practise those
things which be His, to be occupied in His law day and night, to
remember His commandments, to keep His judgments.

<span id="v.ii-p71"></span>“Let us beseech for them yet more earnestly,
That He would deliver them from every evil and inordinate thing, from
every devilish sin, and from every besetment of the adversary, that He
would count them worthy in due season of the Regeneration of the Laver,
of the remission of sins, of the clothing of incorruption, that He would
bless their comings in and goings out, the whole course of their life,
their houses and households, that He would increase their children and
bless them, and bring them to full age, and teach them wisdom, that He
would direct all that is before them unto good.

<span id="v.ii-p72"></span>“Stand up. Pray, ye Catechumens, for the
Angel of peace, that all that is before you may be peaceful; pray that
this day and all the days of your life be full of peace, that your ends
may be Christian; commend yourselves to the living God and to His
Christ.

<span id="v.ii-p73"></span>“Bow ye the head. All respond aloud, Amen.”

<span id="v.ii-p74"></span>A similar Prayer for the Catechumens, with a
few variations, is found in the *Apostolic Constitutions*, lib. viii.
cap. 6. Mr. Field considers it to be of later date than that given
above.

<span id="v.ii-p75"></span>“Pray, ye Catechumens, and all ye faithful,
pray for them in heart, saying, Lord have mercy. And let the deacon
speak for them according to his office, saying for the Catechumens let
us all beseech God.

<span id="v.ii-p76"></span>“That the Good \[God\], the Lover of men,
would favorably hearken to their supplications and prayers, and
accepting their suppliant addresses would help them, and grant unto them
the requests of their hearts as may be expedient for them, and would
reveal unto them the Gospel of his Christ, would enlighten them, and
give them understanding, would instruct them in the knowledge of God,
would teach them His ordinances and judgments, implant in them His pure
and saving fear, would open the ears of their hearts to be occupied in
His law day and night, and confirm them in godliness, would unite them
to, and enrol them in His holy flock counting them worthy of the Laver
of Regeneration, the clothing of incorruption, the true life, and would
deliver them from all ungodliness, and give none occasion to the enemy\*
against them, but cleanse them from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,
and dwell and walk in them by His Christ, would bless their comings in
and goings out, and direct for them all that is before them unto good.

<span id="v.ii-p77"></span>“Let us again earnestly supplicate for them:

<span id="v.ii-p78"></span>“That obtaining remission of their offences
by the initiation, they may be counted worthy of the holy mysteries, and
of constant communion with the saints.

<span id="v.ii-p79"></span>“Stand up; ye Catechumens. Pray for the peace
of God through His Christ, that this day, and all the time of your life,
may be peaceful, and without sin, that your ends may be Christian, God
merciful and favorable; pray for remission of offences; commend
yourselves unto the only unbegotten God through His Christ.

<span id="v.ii-p80"></span>“Bow, and receive the blessing.”
