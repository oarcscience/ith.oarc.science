<span id="iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Homily XXIX.</span>

<span id="iv.xxx-p2"></span><span id="iv.xxx-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xxx-p2.2"></span>[1 Cor.
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xxx-p3"></span>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
would not have you ignorant. Ye know that when ye were Gentiles, ye were
led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.

<span id="iv.xxx-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iv.xxx-p4.1"></span>This</span> whole place is very obscure: but the
obscurity is produced by our ignorance of the facts referred to and by
their cessation, being such as then used to occur but now no longer take
place. And why do they not happen now? Why look now, the cause too of
the obscurity hath produced us again another question: namely, why did
they then happen, and now do so no more?

<span id="iv.xxx-p5"></span>This however let us defer to another time,
but for the present let us state what things were occurring then. Well: 
what did happen then? Whoever was baptized he straightway spake with
tongues and not with tongues only, but many also prophesied, and some
also performed many other wonderful works. For since on their coming
over from idols, without any clear knowledge or training in the ancient
Scriptures, they at once on their baptism received the Spirit, yet the
Spirit they saw not, for It is invisible; therefore God’s grace bestowed
some sensible proof of that energy. And one straightway spake in the
Persian, another in the Roman, another in the Indian, another in some
other such tongue: and this made manifest to them that were without that
it is the Spirit in the very person speaking. Wherefore also he so calls
it, saying, “But to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given to
profit withal;” ([1 Cor. 12.7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p5.1"></span>.) calling the gifts “a manifestation of the
Spirit.” For as the Apostles themselves had received this sign first, so
also the faithful went on receiving it, I mean, the gift of tongues; yet
not this only but also many others: inasmuch as many used even to raise
the dead and to cast out devils and to perform many other such wonders:
and they had gifts too, some less, and some more. But more abundant than
all was the gift of tongues among them:  and this became to them a cause
of division; not from its own nature but from the perverseness of them
that had received it: in that on the one hand the possessors of the
greater gifts were lifted up against them that had the lesser: and these
again were grieved, and envied the owners of the greater. And Paul
himself as he proceeds intimates this. 

<span id="iv.xxx-p6"></span>Since then herefrom they were receiving a
fatal blow in the dissolution of their charity, he takes great care to
correct it. For this happened indeed in Rome also, but not in the same
way. And this is why in the Epistle to the Romans he moots it indeed,
but obscurely and briefly, saying thus: “For even as we have many
members in one body, and all the members have not <span id="page_169">p.
169</span> <span id="iv.xxx-Page_169"></span>the same office; so we, who
are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.
And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us,
whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our
faith; or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that
teacheth to his teaching.” ([Rom. xii.
4-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004)<span id="iv.xxx-p6.1"></span>..md)
And that the Romans also were falling into wilfulness hereby, this he
intimates in the beginning of that discourse, thus saying: “For I say
through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to
think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as
to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of
faith.” ([Rom. xii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p6.2"></span>.) With these, however, (for the disease of
division and pride had not proceeded to any length,) he thus discoursed:
but here with great anxiety; for the distemper had greatly spread.

<span id="iv.xxx-p7"></span>And this was not the only thing to disturb
them, but there were also in the place many soothsayers, inasmuch as the
city was more than usually addicted to Grecian customs, and this with
the rest was tending to offence and disturbance among them. This is the
reason why he begins by first stating the difference between soothsaying
and prophecy. For this cause also they received discerning of spirits,
so as to discern and know which is he that speaketh by a pure spirit,
and which by an impure.

<span id="iv.xxx-p8"></span>For because it was not possible to supply
the evidence of the things uttered from within themselves at the moment;
(for prophecy supplies the proof of its own truth not at the time when
it is spoken, but at the time of the event;) and it was not easy to
distinguish the true prophesier from the pretender; (for the devil
himself, accursed as he is, had entered into them that prophesied, \[See
[1 Kings xxii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p8.1"></span>.\] bringing in false prophets, as if forsooth
they also could foretell things to come;) and further, men were easily
deceived, because the things spoken could not for the present be brought
to trial, ere yet the events had come to pass concerning which the
prophecy was; (for it was the end that proved the false prophet and the
true:)—in order that the hearers might not be deceived before the end,
he gives them a sign which even before the event served to indicate the
one and the other. And hence taking his order and beginning, he thus
goes on also to the discourse concerning the gifts and corrects the
contentiousness that arose from hence likewise. For the present however
he begins the discourse concerning the soothsayers, thus saying,

<span id="iv.xxx-p9"></span>\[2.\] “Now concerning spiritual gifts,
brethren, I would not have you ignorant;” calling the signs “spiritual,”
because they are the works of the Spirit alone, human effort
contributing nothing to the working such wonders. And intending to
discourse concerning them, first, as I said, he lays down the difference
between soothsaying and prophecy, thus saying,

<span id="iv.xxx-p10"></span>“Ye know that when ye were Gentiles, ye
were led away <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) unto those dumb
idols, howsoever ye might be led.” Now what he means is this: “In the
idol-temples,” saith he, “if any were at any time possessed by an
unclean spirit and began to divine, even as one dragged away, so was he
drawn by that spirit in chains:  knowing nothing of the things which he
utters. For this is peculiar to the soothsayer, to be beside himself, to
be under compulsion, to be pushed, to be dragged, to be haled as a
madman. But the prophet not so, but with sober mind and composed temper
and knowing what he is saying, he uttereth all things. Therefore even
before the event do thou from this distinguish the soothsayer and the
prophet. And consider how he frees his discourse of all suspicion;
calling themselves to witness who had made trial of the matter. As if he
had said, “that I lie not nor rashly traduce the religion of the
Gentiles, feigning like an enemy, do ye yourselves bear me witness:
knowing as ye do, when ye were Gentiles, how ye were pulled and dragged
away then.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p12"></span>But if any should say that these too are
suspected as believers, come, even from them that are without will I
make this manifest to you. Hear, for example, Plato saying thus: (Apol.
Soc. c. 7.) “Even as they who deliver oracles and the soothsayers say
many and excellent things, but know nothing of what they utter.” Hear
again another, a poet, giving the same intimation. For whereas by
certain mystical rites and witchcrafts a certain person had imprisoned a
demon in a man, and the man divined, and in his divination was thrown
down and torn, and was unable to endure the violence of the demon, but
was on the point of perishing in that convulsion; he saith to the
persons who were practicing such mystical arts, <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md)

<span id="iv.xxx-p14"></span>Loose me, I pray you:

<span id="iv.xxx-p15"></span>The mighty God no longer mortal flesh

<span id="iv.xxx-p16"></span>Can hold.

<span id="iv.xxx-p17"></span>And again,

<span id="iv.xxx-p18"></span>Unbind my wreaths, and bathe my feet in
drops

<span id="iv.xxx-p19"></span>From the pure stream; erase these mystic
lines, <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md)

<span id="iv.xxx-p21"></span>And let me go.

<span id="iv.xxx-p22"></span>For these and such like things, (for one
might <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="iv.xxx-Page_170"></span>mention many more,) point out to us both of
these facts which follow; the compulsion which holds down the demons and
makes them slaves; and the violence to which they submit who have once
given themselves up to them, so as to swerve even from their natural
reason. And the Pythoness too <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) :
(for I am compelled now to bring forward and expose another disgraceful
custom of theirs, which it were well to pass by, because it is unseemly
for us to mention such things; but that you may more clearly know their
shame it is necessary to mention it, that hence at least ye may come to
know the madness and exceeding mockery of those that make use of the
soothsayers:)  this same Pythoness then is said, being a female, to sit
at times upon the tripod of Apollo astride, and thus the evil spirit
ascending from beneath and entering the lower part of her body, fills
the woman with madness, and she with dishevelled hair begins to play the
bacchanal and to foam at the mouth, and thus being in a frenzy to utter
the words of her madness. I know that you are ashamed and blush when you
hear these things: but they glory both in the disgrace and in the
madness which I have described. These then and all such things. Paul was
bringing forward when he said, “Ye know that when ye were Gentiles, ye
were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p24"></span>And because he was discoursing with those
who knew well, he states not all things with exact care, not wishing to
be troublesome to them, but having reminded them only and brought all
into their recollection, he soon quits the point, hastening to the
subject before him.

<span id="iv.xxx-p25"></span>But what is, “unto those dumb idols?” These
soothsayers used to be led and dragged unto them.

<span id="iv.xxx-p26"></span>But if they be themselves dumb, how did
they give responses to others? And wherefore did the demon lead them to
the images? As men taken in war, and in chains, and rendering at the
same time his deceit plausible. Thus, to keep men from the notion that
it was just a dumb stone, they were earnest to rivet the people to the
idols that their own style and title might be inscribed upon them. But
our rites are not such. He did not however state ours, I mean the
prophesyings. For it was well known to them all, and prophecy was
exercised among them, as was meet for their condition, with
understanding and with entire freedom. Therefore, you see, they had
power either to speak or to refrain from speaking. For they were not
bound by necessity, but were honored with a privilege. For this cause
Jonah fled; ([Jonah i. 3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p26.1"></span>.) for this cause Ezekiel delayed; ([Ezek. iii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015)<span id="iv.xxx-p26.2"></span>..md)
for this cause Jeremiah excused himself. ([Jer. i.
6](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006)<span id="iv.xxx-p26.3"></span>..md) And
God thrusts them not on by compulsion, but advising, exhorting,
threatening; not darkening their mind; for to cause distraction and
madness and great darkness, is the proper work of a demon: but it is
God’s work to illuminate and with consideration to teach things needful.

<span id="iv.xxx-p27"></span>\[3.\] This then is the first difference
between a soothsayer and a prophet; but a second and a different one is
that which he next states, saying,

<span id="iv.xxx-p28"></span>[1 Cor.
12.3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p28.1"></span>.
“Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking in the Spirit
of God calleth Jesus accursed:” and then another:  “and that no man can
say that Jesus is the Lord, but in the Holy Ghost.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p29"></span>“When thou seest,” saith he, “any one not
uttering His name, or anathematizing Him, he is a soothsayer. Again,
when thou seest another speaking all things with His Name, understand
that he is spiritual.” “What then,” say you, “must we say concerning the
Catechumens? For if, no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the
Holy Ghost, what must we say of them who name indeed His Name, but are
destitute of His Spirit <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) ? But
his discourse at this time was not concerning these for there were not
at that time Catechumens, but concerning believers and unbelievers. What
then, doth no demon call upon God’s Name?  Did not the demoniacs say,
“We know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God? ([Mark i.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024)<span id="iv.xxx-p30.2"></span>..md)
Did they not say to Paul, “these men are the servants of the Most High
God?  ([Acts xvi. 17](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p30.3"></span>.) They did, but upon scourging, upon
compulsion; never of their own will and without being scourged.

<span id="iv.xxx-p31"></span>But here it is proper to enquire, both why
the demon uttered these things and why Paul rebuked him. In imitation of
his Teacher; for so Christ did also rebuke: since it was not his will to
have testimony from them. And wherefore did the devil also practise
this? Intending to confound the order of things, and to seize upon the
dignity of the Apostles, and to persuade many to pay attention to
them <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) : which had it happened,
they would easily have made themselves appear from hence worthy of
credit, and have brought in their own designs. That these things then
might not be, and the deceit might not have a beginning, he stops their
mouths even when speaking the truth, so that in their falsehoods men
should not at all give heed unto them, but stop their ears altogether
against the things said by them.

<span id="iv.xxx-p33"></span>\[4.\] Having therefore made manifest the
<span id="page_171">p. 171</span> <span
id="iv.xxx-Page_171"></span>soothsayers and the prophets both by the
first sign and also by the second, he next discourses of the wonders;
not passing without reason to this topic, but so as to remove the
dissension which had thence arisen, and to persuade both those that had
the less portion not to grieve and those who had the greater not to be
elated. Wherefore also he thus began.

<span id="iv.xxx-p34"></span>[1 Cor.
12.4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p34.1"></span>.
“Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p35"></span>And first he attends on him that had the
lesser gift, and was grieved on this account. “For wherefore,” saith he,
“art thou dejected? because thou hast not received as much as another?
Still, consider that it is a free gift and not a debt, and thou wilt be
able to soothe thy pain.” For this cause he spake thus in the very
beginning: “but there are diversities of gifts.” And he said not “of
signs,” nor “of wonders,” but of “gifts,” by the name of free gifts
prevailing on them not only not to grieve but even to be thankful. “And
withal consider this also,” saith he, “that even if thou art made
inferior in the measure of what is given; in that it hath been
vouchsafed thee to receive from the same source as the other who hath
received more, thou hast equal honor. For certainly thou canst not say
that the Spirit bestowed the gift on him, but an angel on thee: since
the Spirit bestowed it both on thee and him. Wherefore he added, “but
the same Spirit.” So that even if there be a difference in the gift, yet
is there no difference in the Giver. For from the same Fountain ye are
drawing, both thou and he.

<span id="iv.xxx-p36"></span>[1 Cor.
12.5](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p36.1"></span>.
“And there are diversities of ministrations, but the same Lord.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p37"></span>Thus, enriching the consolation, he adds
mention of the Son also, and of the Father. And again, he calls these
gifts by another name, designing by this also an increase of
consolation. Wherefore also he thus said: “there are diversities of
ministrations, but the same Lord.” For he that hears of “a gift,” and
hath received a less share, perhaps might grieve; but when we speak of
“a ministration,” the case is different. For the thing implies labor and
sweat. “Why grievest thou then,” saith he, “if he hath bidden another
labor more, sparing thee?”

<span id="iv.xxx-p38"></span>[1 Cor.
12.6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p38.1"></span>.
“And there are diversities of workings, but the same God who worketh all
things in all.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p39"></span>[1 Cor.
12.7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p39.1"></span>.
“But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit
withal.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p40"></span>“And what,” saith one, “is a working?” and
what “a gift?” and what “a ministration?” They are mere differences of
names, since the things are the same. For what “a gift” is, that is “a
ministration,” that he calls “an operation” also. Thus fulfil thy
ministry; ([2 Tim. iv. 5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p40.1"></span>. *ministry*.) and, “I magnify my
ministration:” ([Rom. xi. 13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p40.2"></span>. *office*.) and writing to Timothy, he says,
“Therefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God,
which is in thee. ([2 Tim. i. 6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p40.3"></span>.) And again, writing to the Galatians, he
said, “for he that wrought in Peter to the Apostleship, the same was
mighty in me toward the Gentiles. ([Gal. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#008)<span id="iv.xxx-p40.4"></span>..md)
Seest thou that he implies that there is no difference in the gifts of
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost? Not confounding <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) the Persons, God forbid! but declaring
the equal honor of the Essence. For that which the Spirit bestows, this
he saith that God also works; this, that the Son likewise ordains and
grants. Yet surely if the one were inferior to the other, or the other
to it, he would not have thus set it down nor would this have been his
way of consoling the person who was vexed.

<span id="iv.xxx-p42"></span>\[5.\] Now after this, he comforts him also
in another kind of way; by the consideration that the measure vouchsafed
is profitable to him, even though it be not so large. For having said,
that it is “the same Spirit,” and “the same Lord,” and “the same God,”
and having thereby recovered him, he brings in again another
consolation, thus saying, “but to each one is given the manifestation of
the Spirit to profit withal.” For lest one should say, “what if there be
the same Lord, the same Spirit, the same God? yet I have received less:”
he saith, that thus it was profitable.

<span id="iv.xxx-p43"></span>But he calls miracles a “manifestation of
the Spirit,” with evident reason. For to me who am a believer, he that
hath the Spirit is manifest from his having been baptized:  but to the
unbeliever this will in no wise be manifest, except from the miracles:
so that hence also again there is no small consolation. For though there
be a difference of gifts, yet the evidence is one: since whether thou
hast much or little, thou art equally manifest. So that if thou desirest
to show this, that thou hast the Spirit, thou hast a sufficient
demonstration.

<span id="iv.xxx-p44"></span>Wherefore, now that both the Giver is one
and the thing given a pure favor, and the manifestation takes place
thereby, and this is more profitable for thee; grieve not as if
despised. For not to dishonor thee hath God done it, nor to declare thee
inferior to another, but to spare thee and with a view to thy welfare.
To receive more than one has ability to bear, this rather is
unprofitable, and injurious, and a fit cause of dejection.

<span id="iv.xxx-p45"></span>[1 Cor.
12.8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p45.1"></span>.
“For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;”

<span id="iv.xxx-p46"></span>[1 Cor.
12.9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p46.1"></span>.
“To another, faith in the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing in
the one Spirit.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p47"></span><span id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span
id="iv.xxx-Page_172"></span>Seest thou how he every where makes this
addition, saying, “through the same Spirit, and according to the same
Spirit?” For he knew that the comfort from thence was great.

<span id="iv.xxx-p48"></span>[1 Cor.
12.10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p48.1"></span>.
“To another working of miracles; to another prophecies; to another
discernings of spirits; to another divers kind of tongues; to another
the interpretation of tongues.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p49"></span>Thus, since they boasted themselves in
this, therefore he placed it last, and added,

<span id="iv.xxx-p50"></span>[1 Cor.
12.11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.xxx-p50.1"></span>.
“But all these worketh one and the same Spirit.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p51"></span>The universal medicine in which his
consolation consists is that out of the same root, out of the same
treasures, out of the same streams, they all receive. And accordingly,
from time to time dwelling on this expression, he levels the apparent
inequality, and consoles them. And above indeed he points out both the
Spirit, and the Son, and the Father, as supplying the gifts, but here he
was content to make the Spirit, that even hence again thou mayest
understand their dignity to be the same.

<span id="iv.xxx-p52"></span>But what is “the word of wisdom?” That
which Paul had, which John had, the son of thunder.

<span id="iv.xxx-p53"></span>And what is “the word of knowledge?” That
which most of the faithful had, possessing indeed knowledge, but not
thereupon able to teach nor easily to convey to another what they knew.

<span id="iv.xxx-p54"></span>“And to another, faith:” not meaning by
this faith the faith of doctrines, but the faith of miracles; concerning
which Christ saith, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye
shall say to this mountain, Remove, and it shall remove.” (S. [Matt.
xvii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p54.1"></span>.) And the Apostles too concerning this
besought Him, saying, “Increase our faith:” (S. [Luke xvii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#005)<span id="iv.xxx-p54.2"></span>..md) for
this is the mother of the miracles. But to possess the power of working
miracles and gifts of healing, is not the same thing: for he that had a
gift of healing used only to do cures: but he that possessed powers for
working miracles used to punish also. For a miracle is not the healing
only, but the punishing also: even as Paul inflicted blindness: as Peter
slew.

<span id="iv.xxx-p55"></span>“To another prophecies; and to another
discernings of spirits.” What is, “discernings of spirits?” the knowing
who is spiritual, and who is not: who is a prophet, and who a deceiver:
as he said to the Thessalonians, “despise not prophesyings:” ([1 Thess.
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021)<span id="iv.xxx-p55.1"></span>..md)
but proving <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) all things, hold
fast that which is good.” For great was at that time the rush <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) of the false prophets, the devil
striving underhand to substitute falsehood for the truth. “To another
divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.” For
one person knew what he spake himself, but was unable to interpret to
another; while another had acquired both these or the other of the two.
Now this seemed to be a great gift because both the Apostles received it
first, and the most among the Corinthians had obtained it. But the word
of teaching not so. Wherefore that he places first, but this last:  for
this was on account of that, and so indeed were all the rest; both
prophecies, and working of miracles, and divers kinds of tongues, and
interpretation of tongues. For none is equal to this. Wherefore also he
said, “Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor,
especially they who labor in the word and in teaching.” ([1 Tim. v.
17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017)<span id="iv.xxx-p57.2"></span>..md)
And to Timothy he wrote, saying, “Give attendance to reading, to
exhortation, to teaching; neglect not the gift that is in thee.” ([1
Tim. 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014)<span id="iv.xxx-p57.3"></span>..md)
Seest thou how he calls it also a gift?

<span id="iv.xxx-p58"></span>\[6.\] Next, the comfort which he before
gave, when he said, “the same Spirit,” this also he here sets before us,
saying, “But all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to
each one severally even as he will.” And he not only gives consolation
but also stops the mouth of the gainsayer, saying here, “dividing to
each one severally even as he will.” For it was necessary to bind <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) up also, not to heal only, as he doth
also in the Epistle to the Romans, when he saith, “But who art thou that
repliest against God? ([Rom. ix.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020)<span id="iv.xxx-p59.3"></span>..md) So
likewise here, “dividing to each one severally as he will.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p60"></span>And that which was of the Father, this he
signifieth to be of the Spirit also. For as concerning the Father, he
saith, “but it is the same God who worketh all things in all;” so also
concerning the Spirit, “but all these things worketh one and the same
Spirit.” But, <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) it will be said,
“He doth it, actuated by God.” Nay, he no where said this, but thou
feignest it. For when he saith, “who actuateth <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) all things in all,” he saith this
concerning men: thou wilt hardly say that among those men he numbers
also the Spirit, though thou shouldst be ever so manifold in thy doting
and madness. For because he had said “through the Spirit,” that thou
mightest not suppose this word, “through,” to denote inferiority or the
being actuated, he adds, that “the Spirit worketh,” not “is
worked,” <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) and worketh “as he
will,” not as he is bidden. For as concerning the Father, the Son saith
that “He raiseth up the dead and quickeneth;” in like manner also,
concerning <span id="page_173">p. 173</span> <span
id="iv.xxx-Page_173"></span>Himself, that “He quickeneth whom He will:”
(S. [John v. 21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p63.3"></span>.) thus also of the Spirit, in another place,
that He doeth all things with authority and that there is nothing that
hinders Him; (for the expression, “bloweth where it listeth” \[S. [John
iii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p63.4"></span>,\] though it be spoken of the wind is apt to
establish this;) but here, that “He worketh all things as He will.” And
from another place to learn that He is not one of the things actuated,
but of those that actuate. “For who knoweth,” says he, “the things of a
man, but the spirit of the man? even so the things of God none knoweth
save the Spirit of God.” ([1 Cor. ii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011)<span id="iv.xxx-p63.5"></span>..md)
Now that “the spirit of a man,” i.e., the soul, requires not to be
actuated that it may know the things of itself, is, I suppose, evident
to every one. Therefore neither doth the Holy Ghost, that he may “know
the things of God.” For his meaning is like this, “the secret things of
God” are known to the Holy Spirit as to the soul of man the secret
things of herself.” But if this be not actuated for that end, much less
would That which knoweth the depths of God and needs no actuation for
that knowledge, require any actuating Power in order to the giving gifts
to the Apostles.

<span id="iv.xxx-p64"></span>But besides these things, that also, which
I before spake of, I will mention again now. What then is this? That if
the Spirit were inferior and of another substance, there would have been
no avail in his consolation, nor in our hearing the words, “of the same
Spirit.” For he who hath received from the king, I grant, may find it a
very soothing circumstance, that he himself gave to him; but if it be
from the slave, he is then rather vexed, when one reproaches him with
it. So that even hence is it evident, that the Holy Spirit is not of the
substance of the servant, but of the King.

<span id="iv.xxx-p65"></span>\[7.\] Wherefore as he comforted them, when
he said, that “there are diversities of ministrations, but the same
Lord; and diversities of operations, but the same God;” so also when he
said above, “there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit;” and
after this again when he said, “But all these worketh the one and the
same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p66"></span>“Let us not, I pray you, be at a loss,”
saith he; “neither let us grieve, saying, ‘Why have I received this and
not received that?’ neither let us demand an account of the Holy Spirit.
For if thou knowest that he vouchsafed it from providential care,
consider that from the same care he hath given also the measure of it,
and be content and rejoice in what thou hast received: but murmur not at
what thou hast not received; yea, rather confess God’s favor that thou
hast not received things beyond thy power.”

<span id="iv.xxx-p67"></span>\[5.\] And if in spiritual things one ought
not to be over-curious, much more in temporal things; but to be quiet
and not nicely enquire why one is rich and another poor. For, first of
all, not every single rich man is rich from God, but many even of
unrighteousness, and rapine, and avarice. For he that forbade to be
rich, how can he have granted that which he forbade to receive?

<span id="iv.xxx-p68"></span>But that I may, far above what the case
requires, stop the mouths of those who concerning these things gainsay
us, come, let us carry our discourse higher up, to the time when riches
used to be given by God; and answer me. Wherefore was Abraham rich
whereas Jacob wanted even bread? Were not both the one and the other
righteous? Doth He not say concerning the three alike, “I am the God of
Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob?” ([Exod. iii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006)<span id="iv.xxx-p68.1"></span>..md)
Wherefore then was the one a rich man, and the other a hired servant? Or
rather, why was Esau rich, who was unrighteous and a murderer of his
brother, while Jacob was in bondage for so long a time? Wherefore again
did Isaac live in ease all his time, but Jacob in toils and miseries? 
For which cause also he said, “Few and evil are my days.” ([Gen. xlvii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009)<span id="iv.xxx-p68.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxx-p69"></span>Wherefore did David, who was both a prophet
and a king, himself also live all his time in toils? whereas Solomon his
son spent forty years in security above all men, in the enjoyment of
profound peace, glory, and honor, and going through every kind of
deliciousness? What again could be the reason, that among the prophets
also one was afflicted more, and another less? Because so it was
expedient for each. Wherefore upon each our remark must be, “Thy
judgments are a great deep.” ([Ps. xxxvi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006)<span id="iv.xxx-p69.1"></span>..md) For
if those great and wonderful men were not alike exercised by God, but
one by poverty, and another by riches; one by ease, and another by
trouble; much more ought we now to bear these things in mind.

<span id="iv.xxx-p70"></span>\[8.\] But besides this, it becomes one to
consider also that many of the things which happen do not take place
according to His mind, but arise from our wickedness. Say not then, “Why
is one man rich who is wicked, and another poor who is righteous?” For
first of all, one may give an account of these things also, and say that
neither doth the righteous receive any harm from his poverty, nay, even
a greater addition of honor; and that the bad man in his riches
possesseth but a store of punishment on his future road, unless he be
changed: and, even before punishment, often-times his riches become to
him the cause of many evils, and lead him into ten thousand pitfalls.
But God permits it, at the same to signify the free choice of the <span
id="page_174">p. 174</span> <span id="iv.xxx-Page_174"></span>will, and
also to teach all others not to be mad nor rave after money.

<span id="iv.xxx-p71"></span>“How is it then, when a man being wicked is
rich, and suffers nothing dreadful?” say you. “Since if being good he
hath wealth, he hath it justly: but if bad, what shall we say?” That
even therein he is to be pitied. For wealth added to wickedness
aggravates the mischief. But is he a good man, and poor? Yet is he
nothing injured. Is he then a bad man, and poor? This is he so justly
and by desert, or rather even with advantage to himself. “But such an
one,” say you, “received his riches from his ancestors and lavishes it
upon harlots and parasites, and suffers no evil.” What sayest thou? Doth
he commit whoredom, and sayest thou, “he suffers no evils?” Is he
drunken, and thinkest thou that he is in luxury? Doth he spend for no
good, and judgest thou that he is to be envied? Nay what can be worse
than this wealth which destroys the very soul? But thou, if the body
were distorted and maimed, wouldest say that his was a case for great
lamentation; and seest thou his whole soul mutilated, yet countest him
even happy? “But he doth not perceive it,” say you. Well then, for this
very reason again is he to be pitied, as all frantic persons are. For he
that knows he is sick will of course both seek the physician and submit
to remedies; but he that is ignorant of it will have no chance at all of
deliverance. Dost thou call such an one happy, tell me?

<span id="iv.xxx-p72"></span>But it is no marvel: for the more part are
ignorant of the true love of wisdom. Therefore do we suffer the
extremest penalty, being chastised and not even withdrawing ourselves
from the punishment. For this cause are angers, dejections, and
continual tumults; because when God hath shown us a life without sorrow,
the life of virtue, we leave this and mark out another way, the way of
riches and money, full of infinite evils. And we do the same, as if one,
not knowing how to discern the beauty of men’s bodies but attributing
the whole to the clothes and the ornaments worn, when he saw a handsome
woman and possessed of natural beauty, should pass quickly by her, but
when he beheld one ugly, ill-shaped, and deformed, but clothed in
beautiful garments, should take her for his wife. Now also in some such
way are the multitude affected about virtue and vice. They admit the one
that is deformed by nature on account of her external ornaments, but
turn away from her that is fair and lovely, on account of her unadorned
beauty, for which cause they ought especially to choose her.

<span id="iv.xxx-p73"></span>\[9.\] Therefore am I ashamed that among
the foolish heathen there are those that practise this philosophy, if
not in deeds, yet so far at least as judgment goes; and who know the
perishable nature of things present: whereas amongst us some do not even
understand these things, but have their very judgment corrupted: and
this while the Scripture is ever and anon sounding in our ears, and
saying, “In his sight the vile person is contemned, but he honoreth them
that fear the Lord: ([Ps. xv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p73.1"></span>.) the fear of the Lord excelleth every
thing <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) ; fear God, and keep His
commandments; for this is the whole of man: ([Eccles. xii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#013)<span id="iv.xxx-p74.2"></span>;.md) be
not thou envious of evil men; ([Ps. xlix.
16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016)<span id="iv.xxx-p74.3"></span>;.md)
all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass;”
([Is. xl. 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.xxx-p74.4"></span>.) For these and such-like things though we
hear every day, we are yet nailed to earth. And as ignorant children,
who learn their letters continuously, if they be examined concerning
their order when they are disarranged, naming one instead of another,
make much laughter: so also ye, when here we recount them in order,
follow us in a manner; but when we ask you out of doors and in no set
order, what we ought to place first and what next among things, and
which after which; not knowing how to answer, ye become ridiculous. Is
it not a matter of great laughter, tell me, that they who expect
immortality and the good “things which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of man,” should strive about things
which linger here and count them enviable? For if thou hast need yet to
learn these things that riches are no great thing, that things present
are a shadow and a dream, that like smoke they are dissolved and fly
away: stand for the present without the sanctuary: abide in the
vestibule: since thou art not yet worthy of the entrance to the
palace-courts on high. For if thou knowest not to discern their nature
which is unstable and continually passing away, when wilt thou be able
to despise them?

<span id="iv.xxx-p75"></span>But if thou say thou knowest, cease
curiously to inquire and busy thyself, what can be the reason why such
an one is rich and such an one poor: for thou doest the same when thou
askest these questions, as if thou didst go round and enquire, why one
is fair and another black, or one hook-nosed and another flat-nosed. For
as these things make no difference to us, whether it be thus or thus; so
neither poverty nor riches, and much less than they. But the whole
depends upon the way in which we use them. Whether thou art poor, thou
mayest live cheerfully denying thyself; or rich, thou art most miserable
of all men if thou fliest from virtue. For these are what really concern
us, the things of virtue. And if these things be not added, the rest are
useless. For this cause also are those continual questions, because the
most think that indifferent things are of importance <span
id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span id="iv.xxx-Page_175"></span>to them,
but of the important things they make no account: since that which is of
importance to us is virtue and love of wisdom.

<span id="iv.xxx-p76"></span>Because then ye stand I know not where, at
some far distance from her, therefore is there confusion of thoughts,
therefore the many waves, therefore the tempest. For when men have
fallen from heavenly glory and the love of heaven, they desire present
glory and become slaves and captives. “And how is it that we desire
this,” say you? From the not greatly desiring that. And this very thing,
whence happens it? From negligence. And whence the negligence? From
contempt. And whence the contempt? From folly and cleaving to things
present and unwillingness to investigate accurately the nature of
things. And whence again doth this latter arise? From the neither giving
heed to the reading of the Scripture nor conversing with holy men, and
from following the assemblies of the wicked.

<span id="iv.xxx-p77"></span>That this therefore may not always be so,
and lest wave after wave receiving us should carry us out into the deep
of miseries and altogether drown and destroy us; while there is time,
let us bear up and standing upon the rock, I mean of the divine
doctrines and words, let us look down upon the surge of this present
life. For thus shall we both ourselves escape the same, and having drawn
up others who are making shipwreck, we shall obtain the blessings which
are to come, through the grace and mercy, &c.
