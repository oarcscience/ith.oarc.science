<span id="v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="v.vi-p1.1"></span>Homily VI.</span>

<span id="v.vi-p2"></span><span id="v.vi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.vi-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor. iii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md)<span id="v.vi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.vi-p3"></span>Are we beginning, again to commend ourselves?
or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or letters of
commendation from you?

<span id="v.vi-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.vi-p4.1"></span>He</span> anticipates and puts himself an
objection which others would have urged against him, ‘Thou vauntest
thyself;’ and this though he had before employed so strong a corrective
in the expressions, “Who is sufficient for these things?” and, “of
sincerity…speak we.” ([2 Cor. 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017)<span id="v.vi-p4.2"></span>..md)
Howbeit he is not satisfied with these. For such is his character. From
appearing to say any thing great of himself he is far removed, and
avoids it even to great superfluity and excess. And mark, I pray thee,
by this instance also, the abundance of his wisdom. For a thing of
woeful aspect, I mean tribulations, he so much exalted and showed to be
bright and lustrous, that out of what he said the present objection rose
up against him. And he does so also towards the end. For after having
enumerated numberless perils, insults, straits, necessities, and as many
such like things as be, he added, “We commend not ourselves, but speak
as giving you occasion to glory.” ([2 Cor. v.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012)<span id="v.vi-p4.3"></span>..md) And
he expresses this again with vehemence in that place, and with more of
encouragement. For here the words are those of love, “Need we, as do
some, epistles of commendation?” but there what he says is full of a
kind of pride even, necessarily and properly so, of pride, I say, and
anger. “For we commend not ourselves again,” saith he, “but speak as
giving you occasion to glory;” ([2 Cor. v.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012)<span id="v.vi-p4.4"></span>..md) and,
“Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? For <span
id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562.md) in the sight of God speak we in
Christ. For I fear lest by any means when I come I should not find you
such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would
not.” ([2 Cor. 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#020)<span id="v.vi-p5.3"></span>..md) For
to prevent all appearance of a wish to flatter, as though he desired
honor from them, he speaketh thus, “I fear lest by any means when I come
I should not find you such as I would, and should myself be found of you
such as ye would not.” This however comes after many accusations <span
id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md) ; But in the beginning he speaketh not
so, but <span id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span
id="v.vi-Page_306"></span>more gently. And what is it he saith?  He
spoke of his trials and his perils, and that every where he is conducted
as in procession <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) by God in
Christ, and that the whole world knoweth of these triumphs. Since then
he has uttered great things of himself, he urges this objection against
himself, “Are we beginning again to commend ourselves?” Now what he
saith is this: Perchance some one will object, ‘What is this, O Paul?
Sayest thou these things of thyself, and exaltest thyself?’ To do away
then with this suspicion, he saith, We desire not this, that is, to
boast and exalt ourselves; yea, so far are we from needing epistles of
commendation to you that ye are to us instead of an epistle. “For,”
saith he,

<span id="v.vi-p8"></span>[2 Cor.
3.2](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#002.md)<span id="v.vi-p8.1"></span>. “Ye
are our epistle.”

<span id="v.vi-p9"></span>What means this, “ye are?” ‘Did we need to be
commended to others, we should have produced you before them instead of
an epistle.’ And this he said in the former Epistle. “For the seal of
mine Apostleship are ye.” ([1 Cor. ix.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002)<span id="v.vi-p9.1"></span>..md) But he
doth not here say it in this manner, but in irony so as to make his
question, “Do we need epistles of commendation?” more cutting. And in
allusion to the false apostles, he added, “as do some, \[epistles of
commendation\] to you, or letters of commendation from you” to others.
Then because what he had said was severe, he softens it by adding, “Ye
are our epistle, written in our hearts, known of all,

<span id="v.vi-p10"></span>[2 Cor.
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003.md)<span id="v.vi-p10.1"></span>.
“Being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ.”

<span id="v.vi-p11"></span>Here he testifieth not only to their love,
but also to their good works: since they are able to show unto all men
by their own virtue the high worth of their teacher, for this is the
meaning of, “Ye are our epistle.”

<span id="v.vi-p12"></span>What letters would have done to commend and
gain respect for us, that ye do both as seen and heard of; for the
virtue of the disciples is wont to adorn and to commend the teacher more
than any letter.

<span id="v.vi-p13"></span>[2 Cor.
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003.md)<span id="v.vi-p13.1"></span>.
“Written in our hearts.”

<span id="v.vi-p14"></span>That is, which all know; we so bear you about
every where and have you in mind. As though he said, Ye are our
commendation to others, for we both have you continually in our heart
and proclaim to all your good works. Because then that even to others
yourselves are our commendation, we need no epistles from you; but
further, because we love you exceedingly, we need no commendation to
you. For to those who are strangers one hath need of letters, but ye are
in our mind. Yet he said not merely, “ye are \[in it\],” but “written in
\[it\],” that is, ye cannot slide out of it. For just as from letters by
reading, so from our heart by perceiving, all are acquainted with the
love we bear you. If then the object of a letter be to certify, “such an
one is my friend and let him have free intercourse \[with you\],” your
love is sufficient to secure all this. For should we go to you, we have
no need of others to commend us, seeing your love anticipateth this; and
should we go to others, again we need no letters, the same love again
sufficing unto us in their stead, for we carry about the epistle in our
hearts.

<span id="v.vi-p15"></span>\[2.\] Then exalting them still higher, he
even calleth them the epistle of Christ, saying,

<span id="v.vi-p16"></span>[2 Cor.
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003.md)<span id="v.vi-p16.1"></span>.
“Being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ.”

<span id="v.vi-p17"></span>And having said this, he afterwards hence
takes ground and occasion for a discussion on the Law. And there is
another <span id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md) aim in his here styling
them His epistle. For above as commending him, he called them an
epistle; but here an epistle of Christ, as having the Law of God written
in them. For what things God wished to declare to all and to you, these
are written in your hearts. But it was we who prepared you to receive
the writing. For just as Moses hewed the stones and tables, so we, your
souls. Whence he saith,

<span id="v.vi-p19"></span>“Ministered by us.”

<span id="v.vi-p20"></span>Yet in this they were on an equality; for the
former were written on by God, and these by the Spirit. Where then is
the difference?

<span id="v.vi-p21"></span>“Written not with ink, but with the Spirit of
the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of
flesh.”

<span id="v.vi-p22"></span>Wide as the difference between the Spirit and
ink, and a stony table and a fleshy, so wide is that between these and
those; consequently between themselves <span
id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) who ministered, and him <span
id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md) who ministered to them. Yet because it
was a great thing he had uttered, he therefore quickly checks himself,
saying,

<span id="v.vi-p25"></span>[2 Cor.
3.4](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#004.md)<span id="v.vi-p25.1"></span>. “And
such confidence have we through Christ to Godward,”

<span id="v.vi-p26"></span>And again refers all to God: for it is
Christ, saith he, Who is the Author of these things to us.

<span id="v.vi-p27"></span>[2 Cor.
3.5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md)<span id="v.vi-p27.1"></span>. “Not
that we are sufficient of ourselves to account any thing as from
ourselves.”

<span id="v.vi-p28"></span>See again, yet another corrective. For he
possesses this virtue, humility I mean, in singular perfection.
Wherefore whenever he saith any thing great of himself, he maketh all
diligence to soften down extremely and by every means, what he has said.
And so he does in this place also, saying, “Not that we are sufficient
of ourselves to account any thing as from ourselves:” that is, I said
not, “We have confidence,” as <span id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span
id="v.vi-Page_307"></span>though part were ours and part God’s; but I
refer and ascribe the whole to Him.

<span id="v.vi-p29"></span>[2 Cor.
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md)<span id="v.vi-p29.1"></span>.
“For <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) our sufficiency is from
God; who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant.”

<span id="v.vi-p31"></span>What means, “made us sufficient?” Made us
able and fitting. And it is not a little thing to be the bearer to the
world of such tables and letters, greater far than the former. Whence
also he added,

<span id="v.vi-p32"></span>“Not of the letter, but of the spirit.” See
again another difference. What then? was not that Law spiritual? How
then saith he, “We know that the Law is spiritual?” ([Rom. vii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014)<span id="v.vi-p32.1"></span>..md)
Spiritual indeed, but it bestowed not a spirit. For Moses bare not a
spirit, but letters; but we have been entrusted with the giving of a
spirit. Whence also in further completion of this \[contrast,\] he
saith,

<span id="v.vi-p33"></span>“For the letter killeth, but the spirit
giveth life.”

<span id="v.vi-p34"></span>Yet these things he saith not
absolutely <span id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md) ; but in allusion to
those who prided themselves upon the things of Judaism. And by “letter”
here he meaneth the Law which punisheth them that transgress; but by
“spirit” the grace which through Baptism giveth life to them who by sins
were made dead. For having mentioned the difference arising from the
nature of the tables, he doth not dwell upon it, but rapidly passing it
by, bestows more labor upon this, which most enabled him to lay hold on
his hearer from considerations of what was advantageous and easy; for,
saith he, it is not laborious, and the gift it offers is greater. For if
when discoursing of Christ, he puts especially forward those things
which are of His lovingkindness, more than of our merit, and which are
mutually connected, much greater necessity is there for his doing so
when treating of the covenant. What then is the meaning of “the letter
killeth?” He had said tables of stone and hearts of flesh: so far he
seemed to mention no great difference. He added that the former
\[covenant\] was written with letters or ink, but this with the Spirit.
Neither did this rouse them thoroughly, He says at last what is indeed
enough to give them wings <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md) ; the
one “killeth,” the other “giveth life.” And what doth this mean? In the
Law, he that hath sin is punished; here, he that hath sins cometh and is
baptized and is made righteous, and being made righteous, he liveth,
being delivered from the death of sin. The Law, if it lay hold on a
murderer, putteth him to death; the Gospel, if it lay hold on a
murderer, enlighteneth, and giveth him life. And why do I instance a
murderer? The Law laid hold on one that gathered sticks on a sabbath
day, and stoned him. ([Num. 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032.md),
[36](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#036)<span id="v.vi-p36.2"></span>..md)
This is the meaning of, “the letter killeth.” The Gospel takes hold on
thousands of homicides and robbers, and baptizing delivereth them from
their former vices. This is the meaning of, “the Spirit giveth life.”
The former maketh its captive dead from being alive, the latter
rendereth the man it hath convicted alive from being dead. For, “come
unto me, ye that labor and are heavy laden,” ([Matt. xi.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)<span id="v.vi-p36.3"></span>..md) and,
He said not, ‘I will punish you,’ but, “I will give you rest.” For in
Baptism the sins are buried, the former things are blotted out, the man
is made alive, the entire grace written upon his heart as it were a
table. Consider then how high is the dignity of the Spirit, seeing that
His tables are better than those former ones; seeing that even a greater
thing is shown forth than the resurrection itself. For indeed, that
state of death from which He delivers, is more irremediable than the
former one: as much more so, as soul is of more value than the body: and
this life is conferred by that, by that which the Spirit giveth. But if
It be able to bestow this, much more then that which is less. For, that
prophets wrought, but this they could not: for none can remit sins but
God only; nor did the prophets bestow that life without the Spirit. But
this is not the marvel only, that it giveth life, but that it enabled
others also to do this. For He saith, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost.”
([John xx. 22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.vi-p36.4"></span>.) Wherefore? Because without the Spirit it might
not be? \[Yes,\] but God, as showing that It is of supreme authority,
and of that Kingly Essence, and hath the same power \[with Himself,\]
saith this too. Whence also He adds, “Whosesoever sins ye remit, they
are remitted; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.” ([John
20.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023)<span id="v.vi-p36.5"></span>..md)

<span id="v.vi-p37"></span>\[3.\] Since then It hath given us life, let
us remain living and not return again to the former deadness: for
“Christ dieth no more; for the death that He died, He died unto sin
once:” ([Rom. 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010)<span id="v.vi-p37.1"></span>..md) and
He will not have us always saved by grace: for so we shall be empty of
all things. Wherefore He will have us contribute something also from
ourselves. Let us then contribute, and preserve to the soul its life.
And what is life in a soul, learn from the body. For the body too we
then affirm to live, when it moves with a healthy kind of motion; but
when it lies prostrate and powerless, or its motions are disorderly,
though it retain the semblance of life or motion, such a life is more
grievous than any death: and should it utter nothing sane but words of
the crazy, and see one object instead of another, such a man again is
more pitiable than those who are dead. So also the soul when <span
id="page_308">p. 308</span> <span id="v.vi-Page_308"></span>it hath no
healthiness, though it retain a semblance of life, is dead: when it doth
not see gold as gold but as something great and precious; when it
thinketh not of the future but crawleth upon the ground; when it doth
one thing in place of another. For whence is it clear that we have a
soul? Is it not from its operations? When then it doth not perform the
things proper to it, is it not dead? when, for instance, it hath no care
for virtue, but is rapacious and transgresseth the law; whence can I
tell that thou hast a soul? Because thou walkest? But this belongs to
the irrational creatures as well. Because thou eatest and drinkest? But
this too belongeth to wild beasts. Well then, because thou standest
upright on two feet? This convinceth me rather that thou art a beast in
human form. For when thou resemblest one in all other respects, but not
in its manner of erecting itself, thou dost the more disturb and terrify
me; and I the more consider that which I see to be a monster. For did I
see a beast speaking with the voice of a man, I should not for that
reason say it was a man, but even for that very reason a beast more
monstrous than a beast. Whence then can I learn that thou hast the soul
of a man, when thou kickest like the ass, when thou bearest malice like
the camel, when thou bitest like the bear, when thou ravenest like the
wolf, when thou stealest like the fox, when thou art wily as the
serpent, when thou art shameless as the dog?  Whence can I learn that
thou hast the soul of a man? Will ye that I show you a dead soul and a
living? Let us turn the discourse back to those men of old; and, if you
will, let us set before us the rich man \[in the story\] of Lazarus, and
we shall know what is death in a soul; for he had a dead soul, and it is
plain from what he did. For, of the works of the soul he did not one,
but ate and drank and lived in pleasure only. Such are even now the
unmerciful and cruel, for these too have a dead soul as he had. For all
its warmth that floweth out of the love of our neighbor hath been spent,
and it is deader than a lifeless body. But the poor man was not such,
but standing on the very summit of heavenly wisdom shone out; and though
wrestling with continual hunger, and not even supplied with the food
that was necessary, neither so spake he aught of blasphemy against God,
but endured all nobly. Now this is no trifling work of the soul; but a
very high proof that it is well-strung and healthful. And when there are
not these qualities, it is plainly because the soul is dead that they
have perished. Or, tell me, shall we not pronounce that soul dead which
the Devil falls upon, striking, biting, spurning it, yet hath it no
sense of any of these things, but lieth deadened nor grieveth when being
robbed of its wealth; but he even leapeth upon it, yet it remaineth
unmoved, like a body when the soul is departed, nor even feeleth it? For
when the fear of God is not present with strictness, such must the soul
needs be, and then the dead more miserable. For the soul is not
dissolved into corruption and ashes and dust, but into things of fouler
odor than these, into drunkenness and anger and covetousness, into
improper loves and unseasonable desires. But if thou wouldest know more
exactly how foul an odor it hath, give me a soul that is pure, and then
thou wilt see clearly how foul the odor of this filthy and impure one.
For at present thou wilt not be able to perceive it. For so long as we
are in contact habitually with a foul odor, we are not sensible of it.
But when we are fed with spiritual words, then shall we be cognizant of
that evil. And yet to many this seemeth of no importance <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) . And I say nothing as yet of hell;
but let us, if you will, examine what is present, and how worthy of
derision is he, not that practiseth, but that uttereth filthiness; how
first he loadeth himself with contumely; just as one that sputtereth any
filth from the mouth, so he defiles himself. For if the stream is so
impure, think what must be the fountain of this filth! “for out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” ([Matt. xii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034)<span id="v.vi-p38.3"></span>..md) Yet
not for this alone do I grieve, but because that to some this doth not
even seem to be reckoned amongst improper things. Hence the evils are
all made worse, when we both sin, and do not think we even do
amiss. <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md)

<span id="v.vi-p40"></span>\[4.\] Wilt thou then learn how great an evil
is filthy talking? See how the hearers blush at thy indecency. For what
is viler than a filthy talker? what more infamous? For such thrust
themselves into the rank of buffoons and of prostituted women, yea
rather these have more shame than you. How canst thou teach a wife to be
modest when by such language thou art training her to proceed unto
lasciviousness? Better vent rottenness from the mouth than a filthy
word. Now if thy mouth have an ill-odor, thou partakest not even of the
common meats; when then thou hadst so foul a stink in thy soul, tell me,
dost thou dare to partake of <span id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span
id="v.vi-Page_309"></span>mysteries? Did any one take a dirty vessel and
set it upon the table, thou wouldest have beaten him with clubs and
driven him out: yet God at His own table, (for His table our mouth is
when filled with thanksgiving,) when thou pourest out words more
disgusting than any unclean vessel, tell me, dost thou think that thou
provokest not? And how is this possible? For nothing doth so exasperate
the holy and pure as do such words; nothing makes men so impudent <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) and shameless as to say and listen to
such; nothing doth so unstring the sinews of modesty as the flame which
these kindle. God hath set perfumes in thy mouth, but thou storest up
words of fouler odor than a corpse, and destroyest the soul itself and
makest it incapable of motion. For when thou insultest, this is not the
voice of the soul, but of anger; when thou talkest filthily, it is
lewdness, and not she that spake; when thou detractest, it is envy; when
thou schemest, covetousness. These are not her works, but those of the
affections <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) and the diseases
belonging to her. As then corruption cometh not simply of the body, but
of the death and the passion which is thus in the body; so also, in
truth, these things come of the passions which grow upon the soul. For
if thou wilt hear a voice from a living soul, hear Paul saying, “Having
food and covering, we shall be therewith content:” ([1 Tim. vi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008)<span id="v.vi-p42.2"></span>..md) and
“Godliness is great gain:” ([1 Tim.
6.6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006)<span id="v.vi-p42.3"></span>..md)
and, “The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” ([Gal. vi.
14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014)<span id="v.vi-p42.4"></span>..md) Hear
Peter saying, “Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I
thee.” ([Acts iii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.vi-p42.5"></span>.) Hear Job giving thanks and saying, “The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away.” ([Job i.
21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021)<span id="v.vi-p42.6"></span>..md)
These things are the words of a living soul, of a soul discharging the
functions proper to it. Thus also Jacob said, “If the Lord will give me
bread to eat and raiment to put on.” ([Gen. xxviii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020)<span id="v.vi-p42.7"></span>..md) Thus
also Joseph, “How shall I do this wickedness, and sin before God?”
([Gen. 39.9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.vi-p42.8"></span>.) But not so that barbarian woman; but as one
drunken and insane <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) , so spake
she, saying, “Lie with me.” ([Gen.
39.7](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007)<span id="v.vi-p43.2"></span>..md)
These things then knowing, let us earnestly covet the living soul, let
us flee the dead one, that we may also obtain the life to come; of which
may all we be made partakers, through the grace and love toward men of
our Lord Jesus Christ, though Whom and with Whom, to the Father,
together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and for ever,
and world without end. Amen.

<span id="v.vi-p39"></span> \[Chrysostom’s view of this verse is correct
as far as it goes. But a fuller statement is that the *letter* kills by
demanding perfect obedience which none can render, by producing the
knowledge of sin and guilt, and by exasperating the soul in holding
forth to it a high standard of duty which it neither can nor wishes to
obey. The *spirit*, on the other hand, gives life by revealing a perfect
and gratuitous righteousness, by exhibiting God’s love and awakening
hope instead of fear, and by transforming the soul through the Holy
Ghost so that it bears the image of God. The letter is equivalent to the
Law; the spirit to the Gospel. The contrast is not between the Old
covenant and the New, considered as successive dispensations of the one
system of grace, but between the Mosaic economy as conditioning
acceptance upon works (“Do this and live”), and the Christian as
offering salvation to every one that believeth. C.\]
