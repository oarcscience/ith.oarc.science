<span id="v.xi-p1"></span> <span id="page_331">p. 331</span> <span
id="v.xi-Page_331"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="v.xi-p1.1"></span>Homily XI.</span>

<span id="v.xi-p2"></span><span id="v.xi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.xi-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor. v.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md)<span id="v.xi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xi-p3"></span>Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we
persuade men but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are
made manifest also in your consciences.

<span id="v.xi-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.xi-p4.1"></span>Knowing</span> therefore, he says, these things,
that terrible seat of judgment, we do every thing so as not to give you
a handle nor offence, nor any false suspicion of evil practice against
us. Seest thou the strictness of life, and zeal of a watchful soul? ‘For
we are not only open to accusation,’ he saith ‘if we commit any evil
deed; but even if we do not commit, yet are suspected, and having it in
our power to repel the suspicion, brave it, we are punished.‘

<span id="v.xi-p5"></span>[2 Cor.
5.12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xi-p5.1"></span>. “We
are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you
occasion of glorying in our behalf.”

<span id="v.xi-p6"></span>See how he is continually obviating the
suspicion of appearing to praise himself. For nothing is so offensive to
the hearers as for any one to say great and marvellous things about
himself. Since then he was compelled in what he said to fall upon that
subject, he uses a corrective, saying, ‘we do this for your sakes, not
for ours, that ye may have somewhat to glory of, not that we may.’ And
not even this absolutely, but because of the false Apostles. Wherefore
also he added, “To answer them that glory in appearance, and not in
heart.” Seest thou how he hath detached them from them, and drawn them
to himself; having shown that even the Corinthians themselves are
longing to get hold of some occasion, whereby they may have it in their
power to speak on their <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) behalf
and to defend them unto their accusers. For, says he, ‘we say these
things not that we may boast, but that ye may have wherein to speak
freely on our behalf;’ which is the language of one testifying to their
great love: ‘and not that ye may boast merely: but that ye may not be
drawn aside.’ But this he does not say explicitly, but manages his words
otherwise and in a gentler form, and without dealing them a blow,
saying,

<span id="v.xi-p8"></span>“That ye may have somewhat to glory towards
those which glory in appearance.” But neither this does he bid them do
absolutely, when no cause exists, but when they <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) extol themselves; for in all things he
looks out for the fitting occasion. He does not then do this in order to
show himself to be illustrious, but to stop those men who were using the
thing <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) improperly and to the
injury of these. But what is “in appearance?” In what is seen, in what
is for display. For of such sort were they, doing every thing out of a
love of honor, whilst they were both empty inwardly and wore indeed an
appearance of piety and of venerable seeming, but of good works were
destitute.

<span id="v.xi-p11"></span>\[2.\] [2 Cor.
5.13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013.md)<span id="v.xi-p11.1"></span>.
“For whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we are of
sober mind, it is unto you.”

<span id="v.xi-p12"></span>And if, saith he, we have uttered any great
thing, (for this is what he here calls being beside himself, as
therefore in other places also he calls it folly;— [2 Cor.
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#001.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#021)<span id="v.xi-p12.1"></span>..md) for
God’s sake we do this, lest ye thinking us to be worthless should
despise us and perish; or if again any modest and lowly thing, it is for
your sakes that ye may learn to be lowly-minded. Or else, again, he
means this. If any one thinks us to be mad, we seek for our reward from
God, for Whose sake we are of this suspected; but if he thinks us sober,
let him reap the advantage of our soberness. And again, in another way.
Does any one say we are mad? For God’s sake are we in such sort mad.
Wherefore also he subjoins;

<span id="v.xi-p13"></span>[2 Cor.
5.14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014.md)<span id="v.xi-p13.1"></span>.
“For the love of God <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md)
constraineth us, because we thus judge.”

<span id="v.xi-p15"></span>‘For not the fear of things to come only,’ he
saith, ‘but also those which have already happened allow us not to be
slothful nor to slumber; but stir us up and impel us to these our labors
on your behalf.’ And what are those things which have already happened?

<span id="v.xi-p16"></span>“That if one died for all, then all died.”
‘Surely then it was because all were lost,’ saith he. For except all
were dead, He had not died for all <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) . For here the opportunities <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) of salvation <span id="page_332">p.
332</span> <span id="v.xi-Page_332"></span>exist; but there are found no
longer. Therefore, he says, “The love of God constraineth us,” and
allows us not to be at rest. For it cometh of extreme wretchedness and
is worse than hell itself, that when He hath set forth an act so mighty,
any should be found after so great an instance of His provident care
reaping no benefit. For great was the excess of that love, both to die
for a world of such extent <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) , and
dying for it when in such a state.

<span id="v.xi-p20"></span>[2 Cor.
5.15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015.md)<span id="v.xi-p20.1"></span>.
“That they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto
Him who for their sakes died and rose again.”

<span id="v.xi-p21"></span>If therefore we ought not to live unto
ourselves, ‘be not troubled,’ says he, ‘nor be confounded when dangers
and deaths assail you.’ And he assigns besides an indubitable argument
by which he shows that the thing is a debt. For if through Him we live
who were dead; to Him we ought to live through Whom we live. And what is
said appears indeed to be one thing, but if any one accurately examine
it, it is two: one that we live by Him, another that He died for us:
either of which even by itself is enough to make us liable; but when
even both are united consider how great the debt is. Yea, rather, there
are three things here. For the First-fruits also for thy sake He raised
up, and led up to heaven: wherefore also he added, “Who for our sakes
died and rose again.”

<span id="v.xi-p22"></span>\[3.\] [2 Cor.
5.16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016.md)<span id="v.xi-p22.1"></span>.
“Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh.”

<span id="v.xi-p23"></span>For if all died and all rose again; and in
such sort died as the tyranny of sin condemned them; but rose again
“through the laver of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost;”
([Titus iii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.xi-p23.1"></span>.) he saith with reason, “we know none” of the
faithful “after the flesh.” For what if even they be in the flesh? Yet
is that fleshly life destroyed, and we are born again <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) by the Spirit, and have learnt another
deportment and rule and life and condition <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) , that, namely, in the heavens. And
again of this itself he shows Christ to be the Author. Wherefore also he
added,

<span id="v.xi-p26"></span>“Even though we have known Christ after the
flesh, yet now we know Him so no more.”

<span id="v.xi-p27"></span>What then? tell me. Did He put away the
flesh, and is He now not with that body? Away with the thought, for He
is even now clothed in flesh; for “this Jesus Who is taken up from you
into Heaven shall so come. So? How? In flesh, with His body. How then
doth he say, “Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now
henceforth no more?” ([Acts i. 11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.xi-p27.1"></span>.) For in us indeed “after the flesh” is being in
sins, and “not after the flesh” not being in sins; but in Christ, “after
the flesh” is His being subject to the affections of nature, such as to
thirst, to hunger, to weariness, to sleep. For “He did no sin, neither
was guile found in His mouth.” ([1 Pet. ii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022)<span id="v.xi-p27.2"></span>..md)
Wherefore He also said, “Which of you convicteth Me of sin?” ([John
viii. 46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046.md)<span
id="v.xi-p27.3"></span>.) and again, “The prince of this world cometh,
and he hath nothing in Me.” ([John
14.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030)<span id="v.xi-p27.4"></span>..md)
And “not after the flesh” is being thenceforward freed even from these
things, not the being without flesh. For with this also He cometh to
judge the world, His being impassible and pure. Whereunto we also shall
advance when “our body” hath been “fashioned like unto His glorious
body.” ([Philip. iii. 21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)<span
id="v.xi-p27.5"></span>.)

<span id="v.xi-p28"></span>\[4.\] [2 Cor.
5.17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md)<span id="v.xi-p28.1"></span>.
“Wherefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature.”

<span id="v.xi-p29"></span>For seeing he had exhorted unto virtue from
His love, he now leads them on to this from what has been actually done
for them; wherefore also he added, “If any man is in Christ,” he is “a
new creature.” “If any,” saith he, “have believed in Him, he has come to
another creation, for he hath been born again by the Spirit.” So that
for this cause also, he says, we ought to live unto Him, not because we
are not our own only, nor because He died for us only, nor because He
raised up our First-fruits only, but because we have also come unto
another life. See how many just grounds he urges for a life of virtue.
For on this account he also calls the reformation by a grosser
name <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) , in order to show the
transition and the change to be great. Then following out farther what
he had said, and showing how it is “a new creation,” he adds, “The old
things are passed away, behold, all things are <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) become new.”

<span id="v.xi-p32"></span>What old things? He means either sins and
impieties, or else all the Judaical observances. Yea rather, he means
both the one and the other. “Behold, all things are become new.”

<span id="v.xi-p33"></span>[2 Cor.
5.18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018.md)<span id="v.xi-p33.1"></span>.
“But all things are of God.”

<span id="v.xi-p34"></span>Nothing of ourselves. For remission of sins
and adoption and unspeakable glory are given to us by Him. For he
exhorts them no longer from the things to come only, but even from those
now present. For consider. He said, that we shall be raised again, and
go on unto incorruption, and have an eternal house; but since present
things have more force to persuade than things to come, with those who
believe not in these as they ought to believe, he shows how great things
they have even already received, and being themselves what. What then
being, received they them? Dead all; (for he saith, “all died;” and, “He
<span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span id="v.xi-Page_333"></span>died
for all;” so loved He all alike;) inveterate all, and grown old in their
vices. But behold, both a new soul, (for it was cleansed,) and a new
body, and a new worship, and promises new, and covenant, and life, and
table, and dress, and all things new absolutely <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) . For instead of the Jerusalem below
we have received that mother city which is above ([Gal. iv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026)<span id="v.xi-p35.3"></span>..md); and
instead of a material temple have seen a spiritual temple; instead of
tables of stone, fleshy ones; instead of circumcision, baptism; instead
of the manna, the Lord’s body; instead of water from a rock, blood from
His side; instead of Moses’ or Aaron’s rod, the Cross; instead of the
promised \[land\] <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) , the kingdom
of heaven; instead of a thousand priests, One High Priest; instead of a
lamb without reason <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) , a
Spiritual Lamb. With these and such like things in his thought he said,
“all things are new.” But “all” these “things are of God,” by Christ,
and His free gift. Wherefore also he added,

<span id="v.xi-p38"></span>“Who reconciled us to Himself through Christ,
and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation.”

<span id="v.xi-p39"></span>For from Him are all the good things. For He
that made us friends is Himself also the cause of the other things which
God hath given to His friends. For He rendered not these things unto us,
allowing us to continue enemies, but having made us friends unto
Himself. But when I say that Christ is the cause of our reconciliation,
I say the Father is so also: when I say that the Father gave, I say the
Son gave also. “For all things were made by Him;” ([John i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003)<span id="v.xi-p39.1"></span>..md) and
of this too He is the Author. For we ran not unto Him, but He Himself
called us. How called He us? By the sacrifice of Christ.

<span id="v.xi-p40"></span>“And gave unto us the ministry of
reconciliation.”

<span id="v.xi-p41"></span>Here again he sets forth the dignity of the
Apostles; showing how great a thing was committed to their hands, and
the surpassing greatness of the love of God. For even when they would
not hear the Ambassador that came, He was not exasperated nor left them
to themselves, but continueth to exhort them both in His own person and
by others. Who can be fittingly amazed at this solicitude? The Son Who
came to reconcile, His True and Only-Begotten, was slain, yet not even
so did the Father turn away from His murderers; nor say, “I sent My Son
as an Ambassador, but they not only would not hear Him, but even slew
and crucified Him, it is meet henceforth to leave them to themselves:”
but quite the contrary, when the Son departed, He entrusted the business
to us; for he says, “gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation.

<span id="v.xi-p42"></span>\[5.\] [2 Cor.
5.19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md)<span id="v.xi-p42.1"></span>. “To
wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not
reckoning unto them their tresspasses.”

<span id="v.xi-p43"></span>Seest thou love surpassing all expression,
all conception? Who was the aggrieved one? Himself. Who first sought the
reconciliation? Himself. ‘And yet,’ saith one, ‘He sent the Son, He did
not come Himself.’ The Son indeed it was He sent; still not He alone
besought, but both with Him and by Him the Father; wherefore he said,
that, “God was reconciling the world unto Himself in Christ:” that is,
by Christ <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) . For seeing he had
said, “Who gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;” he here used a
corrective, saying, “Think not that we act of our own authority <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) in the business: we are ministers; and
He that doeth the whole is God, Who reconciled the world by the
Only-Begotten.” And how did He reconcile it unto Himself? For this is
the marvel, not that it was made a friend only, but also by this way a
friend. This way? What way?  Forgiving them their sins; for in no other
way was it possible. Wherefore also he added, “Not reckoning unto them
their tresspasses.” For had it been His pleasure to require an account
of the things we had transgressed in, we should all have perished; for
“all died.” But nevertheless though our sins were so great, He not only
did not require satisfaction, but even became reconciled; He not only
forgave, but He did not even “reckon.” So ought we also to forgive our
enemies, that ourselves too may obtain the like forgiveness.

<span id="v.xi-p46"></span>“And having committed unto us the word of
reconciliation.”

<span id="v.xi-p47"></span>For neither have we come now on any odious
office; but to make all men friends with God. For He saith, ‘Since they
were not persuaded by Me, do ye continue beseeching until ye have
persuaded them.’ Wherefore also he added,

<span id="v.xi-p48"></span>[2 Cor.
5.20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md)<span id="v.xi-p48.1"></span>. “We
are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were
entreating by us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled
to God.”

<span id="v.xi-p49"></span>Seest thou how he has extolled the thing by
introducing Christ thus in the form of a suppliant <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) ; yea rather not Christ only, but even
<span id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span id="v.xi-Page_334"></span>the
Father? For what he says is this: ‘The Father sent the Son to beseech,
and to be His Ambassador unto mankind. When then He was slain and gone,
we succeeded to the embassy; and in His stead and the Father’s we
beseech you. So greatly doth He prize mankind that He gave up even the
Son, and that knowing He would be slain, and made us Apostles for your
sakes; so that he said with reason, “All things are for your sakes.” ([2
Cor. iv. 15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.xi-p50.2"></span>.) “We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of
Christ,” that is, instead of Christ; for we have succeeded to His
functions.’ But if this appears to thee a great thing, hear also what
follows wherein he shows that they do this not in His stead only, but
also in stead of the Father. For therefore he also added, “As though God
were entreating by us.” ‘For not by the Son Himself only doth He
beseech, but also by us who have succeeded to the office of the Son.
Think not therefore,’ he says, ‘that by us you are entreated; Christ
Himself, the Father Himself of Christ, beseeches you by us. What can
come up to this excess \[of goodness\]? He was outraged who had
conferred innumerable benefits; having been outraged, He not only
exacted not justice, but even gave His son that we might be reconciled.
They that received Him were not reconciled, but even slew Him. Again, He
sent other ambassadors to beseech, and though these are sent, it is
Himself that entreats. And what doth He entreat? “Be ye reconciled unto
God.” And he said not, ‘Reconcile God to yourselves;’ for it is not He
that beareth enmity, but ye; for God never beareth enmity. Urging
moreover his cause, like an ambassador on his mission, <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) he says,

<span id="v.xi-p52"></span>[2 Cor.
5.21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md)<span id="v.xi-p52.1"></span>.
“For Him who knew no sin He made to be sin on our account.”

<span id="v.xi-p53"></span>‘I say nothing of what has gone before, that
ye have outraged Him, Him that had done you no wrong, Him that had done
you good, that He exacted not justice, that He is first to beseech,
though first outraged; let none of these things be set down at present.
Ought ye not in justice to be reconciled for this one thing only that He
hath done to you now?’ And what hath He done? “Him that knew no sin He
made to be sin, for you.” For had He achieved nothing but done only
this, think how great a thing it were to give His Son for those that had
outraged Him. But now He hath both well achieved mighty things, and
besides, hath suffered Him that did no wrong to be punished for those
who had done wrong. But he did not say this: but mentioned that which is
far greater than this. What then is this? “Him that knew no sin,” he
says, Him that was righteousness itself <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) , “He made sin,” that is suffered as a
sinner to be condemned, as one cursed to die. “For cursed is he that
hangeth on a tree.” ([Gal. iii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)<span id="v.xi-p54.2"></span>..md) For
to die thus was far greater than to die; and this he also elsewhere
implying, saith, “Becoming obedient unto death, yea the death of the
cross.” ([Philip. ii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.xi-p54.3"></span>.) For this thing carried with it not only
punishment, but also disgrace. Reflect therefore how great things He
bestowed on thee. For a great thing indeed it were for even a sinner to
die for any one whatever; but when He who undergoes this both is
righteous and dieth for sinners; and not dieth only, but even as one
cursed; and not as cursed \[dieth\] only, but thereby freely bestoweth
upon us those great goods which we never looked for; (for he says, that
“we might become the righteousness of God in Him;”) what words, what
thought shall be adequate to realize these things? ‘For the righteous,’
saith he, ‘He made a sinner; that He might make the sinners righteous.’
 Yea rather, he said not even so, but what was greater far; for the word
he employed is not the habit, but the quality itself. For he said not
“made” \[Him\] a sinner, but “sin;” not, ‘Him that had not sinned’ only,
but “that had not even known sin; that we” also “might become,” he did
not say ‘righteous,’ but, “righteousness,” and, “the righteousness of
God.” For this is \[the righteousness\] “of God” when we are justified
not by works, (in which case it were necessary that not a spot even
should be found,) but by grace, in which case all sin is done away. And
this at the same time that it suffers us not to be lifted up, (seeing
the whole is the free gift of God,) teaches us also the greatness of
that which is given. For that which was before was a righteousness of
the Law and of works, but this is “the righteousness of God.”

<span id="v.xi-p55"></span>\[6.\] Reflecting then on these things, let
us fear these words more than hell; let us reverence the things \[they
express\] more than the kingdom, and let us not deem it grievous to be
punished, but to sin. For were He not to punish us, we ought to take
vengeance on ourselves, who have been so ungrateful towards our
Benefactor. Now he that hath an object of affection, hath often even
slain himself, when unsuccessful in his love; and though successful, if
he hath been guilty of a fault towards her, counts it not fit that he
should even live; and shall not we, when we outrage One so loving and
gentle, cast ourselves into the fire of hell? Shall I say something
strange, and marvellous, and to many perhaps incredible? To one who hath
understanding and loveth the Lord as it behoveth to love Him, there will
be greater comfort if punished after provoking One so loving, than if
<span id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span id="v.xi-Page_335"></span>not
punished. And this one may see by the common practice. For he that has
wronged his dearest friend feels then the greatest relief, when he has
wreaked vengeance on himself and suffered evil. And accordingly David
said, “I the shepherd have sinned, and I the shepherd have done amiss;
and these the flock, what have they done? Let Thy hand be upon me, and
upon my father’s house.” ([2 Sam. xxiv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017)<span id="v.xi-p55.1"></span>. LXX..md)
And when he lost Absalom he wreaked the extremest vengeance upon
himself, although he was not the injurer but the injured; but
nevertheless, because he loved the departed exceedingly, he racked
himself with anguish, in this manner comforting himself. Let us
therefore also, when we sin against Him Whom we ought not to sin
against, take vengeance on ourselves. See you not those who have lost
true-born children, that they therefore both beat themselves and tear
their hair, because to punish themselves for the sake of those they
loved carries comfort with it. But if, when we have caused no harm to
those dearest to us, to suffer because of what hath befallen them brings
consolation; when we ourselves are the persons who have given
provocation and wrong, will it not much rather be a relief to us to
suffer the penalty and will not the being unpunished punish? Every one
in a manner will see this. If any love Christ as it behoveth to love
Him, he knoweth what I say; how, even when He forgiveth, he will not
endure to go unpunished; for thou undergoest the severest punishment in
having provoked Him. And I know indeed that I am speaking what will not
be believed by the many; but nevertheless it is so as I have said. If
then we love Christ as it behoveth to love Him, we shall punish
ourselves when we sin. For to those who love any whomsover, not the
suffering somewhat because they have provoked the beloved one is
unpleasing; but above all, that they have provoked the person loved. And
if this last when angered doth not punish, he hath tortured his lover
more; but if he exacts satisfaction, he hath comforted him rather. Let
us therefore not fear hell, but offending God; for it is more grievous
than that when He turns away in wrath: this is worse than all, this
heavier than all. And that thou mayest learn what a thing it is,
consider this which I say. If one that was himself a king, beholding a
robber and malefactor under punishment, gave his well-beloved son, his
only-begotten and true, to be slain; and transferred the death and the
guilt as well, from him to his son, (who was himself of no such
character,) that he might both save the condemned man and clear him from
his evil reputation <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) ; and then
if, having subsequently promoted him to great dignity, he had yet, after
thus saving him and advancing him to that glory unspeakable, been
outraged by the person that had received such treatment: would not that
man, if he had any sense, have chosen ten thousand deaths rather than
appear guilty of so great ingratitude? This then let us also now
consider with ourselves, and groan bitterly for the provocations we have
offered our Benefactor; nor let us therefore presume, because though
outraged He bears it with long-suffering; but rather for this very
reason be full of remorse <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) . For
amongst men too, when one that hath been smitten on the right cheek
offers the left also, he more avengeth himself than if he gave ten
thousand blows; and when one that hath been reviled, not only revileth
not again but even blesseth, he hath stricken \[his adversary\] more
heavily, than if he rained upon him ten thousand reproaches. Now if in
the case of men we feel ashamed when offering insults we meet with
long-suffering; much rather, in respect to God, ought they to be afraid
who go on continually sinning yet suffer no calamity. For, even for evil
unto their own heads is the unspeakable punishment treasured up for
them. These things then bearing in mind, let us above all things be
afraid of sin; for this is punishment, this is hell, this is ten
thousand ills. And let us not only be afraid of, but also flee from it,
and strive to please God continually; for this is the kingdom, this is
life, this is ten thousand goods. So shall we also even here obtain
already the kingdom and the good things to come; whereunto may we all
attain, through the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ;
with Whom to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, be glory, might, honor,
now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.

<span id="v.xi-p44"></span> \[It is clear that Chrysostom did not favor
the view given in the A.V., which connects the substantive verb with the
phrase “in Christ,” and separates it from the participle. He rather
agrees with the Rev. Version which obliterates the comma after Christ,
and makes the emphasis to lie on the reconciliation effected in or
through Christ, and not on the fact that God was in Christ,—a
proposition true enough in itself, but not before the Apostle’s mind at
this time. C.\]

id="v.xi-p55.2"></span>

<span id="v.xi-p56"></span> \[The comparison here made shows clearly how
the author understood the closing words of the fifth chapter of the
Epistle. Indeed his treatment of the weighty [2 Cor.
5.21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md)<span id="v.xi-p56.1"></span> is
very satisfactory. He does not with Augustin and others take <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xi-p56.2"></span> ἀμαρτίαν</span> in the sense
of a sin-offering, a sense which it is very doubtful if the word ever
has, and one that here would be inconsistent with the use of the same
word in the clause immediately preceding as well as with the evidently
designed antithesis between “sin” and “righteousness.” But he regards
the abstract as used for the concrete, which is certainly the true view.
The phrase is, as Beet says, “practically the same as, but stronger
than, *made to be a sinner*. By laying upon Christ the punishment of our
sin, God made him to be a visible embodiment of the deadly and
far-reaching power of sin.” But Chrysostom shows by his comments his
acceptance not only of the vicarious atonement, but also of the
gratuitous justification, as set forth concisely yet distinctly in this
pregnant utterance. There are passages in these and other Homilies which
look as if the author held to justification by works, but here he is
outspoken to the contrary. Justification comes by grace, not merit, and
the righteousness required is the free gift of God. C.\]
