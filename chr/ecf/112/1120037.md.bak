<span id="iv.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXIII.</span>

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p2"></span><span id="iv.xxxiv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xxxiv-p2.2"></span>[1 Cor. xiii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p3"></span>Love suffereth long, and is kind; love
envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iv.xxxiv-p4.1"></span>Thus</span>, whereas he had showed, that both
faith and knowledge and prophecy and tongues and gifts and healing and a
perfect life and martyrdom, if love be absent, are no great advantage;
of necessity he next makes an outline of its matchless beauty, adorning
its image with the parts of virtue as with a sort of colors, and putting
together all its members with exactness. But do not thou hastily pass
by, beloved, the things spoken, but examine each one of them with much
care, that thou mayest know both the treasure which is in the thing and
the art of the painter. Consider, for example, from what point he at
once began, and what he set first, as the cause of all its excellence.
And what is this? Long-suffering. This is the root of all self-denial.
Wherefore also a certain wise man said, “A man that is
long-suffering <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) is of great
understanding; but he that is hasty of spirit is mightily foolish <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) .”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p7"></span>And comparing it too with a strong city,
he said that it is more secure than that. For it is both an invincible
weapon and a sort of impregnable tower, easily beating off all
annoyances. And as a spark falling into the deep doth it no injury, but
is itself easily quenched: so upon a long-suffering soul whatever
unexpected thing falls, this indeed speedily vanishes, but the soul it
disturbs not: for of a truth there is nothing so impenetrable as
long-suffering. You may talk of armies, money, horses, walls, arms, or
any thing else whatsoever; you will name nothing like long-suffering.
For he that is encompassed with those, oftentimes, being overcome by
anger, is upset like a worthless child, and fills all with confusion and
tempest: but this man, settled as it were in a harbor, enjoys a profound
calm. Though thou surround him <span id="page_195">p. 195</span> <span
id="iv.xxxiv-Page_195"></span>with loss, thou hast not moved the rock;
though thou bring insult upon him, thou hast not shaken the tower: and
though thou bruise him with stripes, thou hast not wounded the adamant.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p8"></span>Yea, and therefore is he called
long-suffering, because he hath a kind of long and great soul. For that
which is long is also called great. But this excellence is born of love,
both to them who possess and to them who enjoy it contributing no small
advantage. For tell me not of those abandoned wretches, who, doing evil
and suffering none, become worse: since here, not from his
long-suffering, but from those who abuse it, this result arises. Tell me
not therefore of these, but of those gentler persons, who gain great
benefit therefrom. For when, having done ill, they suffer none, admiring
the meekness of the sufferer, they reap thereby a very great lesson of
self command.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p9"></span>But Paul doth not stop here, but adds also
the other high achievements of love, saying, “is kind.” For since there
are some who practise their long-suffering with a view not to their own
self-denial, but to the punishment of those who have provoked them, to
make them burst with wrath; he saith that neither hath charity this
defect. Wherefore also he added, “is kind.” For not at all with a view
to light up the fire, in those who are inflamed by anger, do they deal
more gently <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) with them, but in
order to appease and extinguish it: and not only by enduring nobly, but
also by soothing and comforting, do they cure the sore and heal the
wound of passion.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p11"></span>“Envieth not.” For it is possible for one
to be both long-suffering and envious, and thereby that excellency is
spoiled. But love avoids this also.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p12"></span>“Vaunteth not itself;” i.e., is not
rash <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) . For it renders him who
loves both considerate, and grave, and steadfast. In truth, one mark of
those who love unlawfully is a defect in this point. Whereas he to whom
this love is known, is of all men the most entirely freed from these
evils. For when there is no anger within, both rashness and insolence
are clean taken away. Love, like some excellent husbandman, taking her
seat inwardly in the soul and not suffering any of these thorns to
spring up.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p14"></span>“Is not puffed up.” For so we see many
who think highly of themselves on the score of these very excellencies;
for example, on not being envious, nor grudging, nor mean-spirited, nor
rash: these evils being incidental not to wealth and poverty only, but
even to things naturally good. But love perfectly purges out all. And
consider: he that is long-suffering is not of course also kind. But if
he be not kind, the thing becomes a vice, and he is in danger of falling
into malice. Therefore she supplies a medicine, I mean kindness, and
preserves the virtue pure. Again, the kind person often becomes
over-complaisant; but this also she corrects. For “love,” saith he,
“vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up:” the kind and long-suffering is
often ostentatious; but she takes away this vice also.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p15"></span>And see how he adorns her not only from
what she hath, but also from what she hath not. For he saith that she
both brings in virtue, and extirpates vice, nay rather she suffers it
not to spring up at all <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) . Thus
he said not, “She envieth, indeed, but overcometh envy;” nor, “is
arrogant, but chastiseth that passion;” but, “envieth not, vaunteth not
itself, is not puffed up;” which truly is most to be admired, that even
without toil she accomplishes her good things, and without war and
battle-array her trophy is set up: she not permitting him that
possesseth her to toil and so to attain the crown, but without labor
conveying to him her prize. For where there is not passion to contend
against sober reason, what labor can there be?

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p17"></span>\[2.\] “Doth not behave itself
unseemly. <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) ” “Nay, why,” saith
he, “do I say, she ‘is not puffed up,’ when she is so far from that
feeling, that in suffering the most shameful things for him whom she
loves, she doth not even count the thing an unseemliness?” Again, he did
not say, “she suffereth unseemliness but beareth the shame nobly,” but,
“she doth not even entertain any sense at all of the shame.” For if the
lovers of money endure all manner of reproaches for the sake of that
sordid traffic of theirs, and far from hiding their faces, do even exult
in it: much more he that hath this praiseworthy love will refuse nothing
whatsoever for the safety’s sake of those whom he loves: nay, nor will
any thing that he can suffer shame him.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p19"></span>And that we may not fetch our example
from any thing base, let us examine this same statement in its
application to Christ, and then we shall see the force of what hath been
said. For our Lord Jesus Christ was both spit upon and beaten with rods
by pitiful slaves; and not only did He not count it an unseemliness, but
He even exulted and called the thing glory; and bringing in a robber and
murderer with Himself before the rest into paradise, and discoursing
with a harlot, and this when the standers-by all accused Him, He counted
not the thing to <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="iv.xxxiv-Page_196"></span>be disgraceful, but both allowed her to
kiss His feet, and to bedew His body with her tears, and to wipe them
away with her hair, and this amid a company of spectators who were foes
and enemies; “for love doeth nothing unseemly.”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p20"></span>Therefore also fathers, though they be
the first of philosophers and orators, are not ashamed to lisp with
their children; and none of those who see them find fault with them, but
the thing is esteemed so good and right as to be even worthy of prayer.
And again, should they become vicious, the parents keep on correcting,
caring for them, abridging the reproaches they incur, and are not
ashamed. For love “doth nothing unseemly,” but as it were with certain
golden wings covereth up all the offences of the beloved.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p21"></span>Thus also Jonathan loved David; and
hearing his father say, ([1 Sam. xx.
30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p21.1"></span>..md)
“Thou son of damsels that have run away from their homes <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) , thou womanly bred, <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) ” he was not ashamed, though the words
be full of great reproach. For what he means is this: “Thou son of mean
harlots who are mad after men, who run after the passers-by, thou
unnerved and effeminate wretch, who hast nothing of a man, but livest to
the shame of thyself and the mother who bare thee.” What then? Did he
grieve at these things, and hide his face, and turn away from his
beloved? Nay, quite the contrary; he displayed his fondness as an
ornament. And yet the one was at that time a king, and a king’s son,
even Jonathan; the other a fugitive and a wanderer, I mean, David. But
not even thus was he ashamed of his friendship. “For love doth not
behave itself unseemly. Yea, this is its wonderful quality that not only
it suffers not the injured to grieve and feel galled, but even disposes
him to rejoice. Accordingly, he too, of whom we are speaking, after all
these things, just as though he had a crown put on him, went away and
fell on David’s neck. For love knows not what sort of thing shame may
be. Therefore it glories in those things for which another hides his
face. Since the shame is, not to know how to love; not, when thou
lovest, to incur danger and endure all for the beloved.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p24"></span>But when I say, “all,” do not suppose I
mean things injurious also; for example, assisting a youth in a love
affair, or whatsoever hurtful thing any one may beseech another to do
for him. For such a person doth not love, and this I showed you lately
from the Egyptian woman: since in truth he only is the lover who seeks
what is profitable to the beloved: so that if any pursue not this, even
what is right and good, though he make ten thousand professions of love,
he is more hostile than any enemies.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p25"></span>So also Rebecca aforetime, because she
exceedingly clung to her son, both perpetrated a theft, and was not
ashamed of detection, neither was she afraid, though the risk was no
common one; but even when her son raised scruples <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) to her, “upon me be thy curse, my
son,” she said. Dost thou see even in a woman the soul of the
Apostle <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) how, even as Paul chose,
(if one may compare a small thing with a great,) to be anathema for the
Jews’ sake, ([Rom. ix. 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p28.1"></span>.) so also she, that her son might be
blessed, chose to be no less than accursed. And the good things she gave
up to him, for she was not, it seems, to be blessed with him, but the
evils she was prepared to endure herself alone: nevertheless, she
rejoiced, and hasted, and this where so great a danger lay before her,
and she was grieved at the delay of the business: for she feared lest
Esau might anticipate them and render her wisdom vain. Wherefore also
she cuts short the conversation and urges on the young man, and just
permitting him to answer what had been said, states a <span
id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span id="iv.xxxiv-Page_197"></span>reason
sufficient to persuade him. For she said not, “thou sayest these things
without reason, and in vain thou fearest, thy father having grown old
and being deprived of clearness of sight:” but what? “upon me be thy
curse, my son. Only do thou not mar the plot, nor lose the object of our
chase, nor give up the treasure.”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p29"></span>And this very Jacob, served he not for
wages with his kinsmen twice seven years? Was he not together with the
bondage subject to mockery in respect of that trick? What then?  Did he
feel the mockery? Did he count it behaving himself unseemly, that being
a freeman, and free born, and well brought up, he endured slaves’
treatment among his own kinsmen: a thing which is wont to be most
vexing, when one receives opprobrious treatment from one’s friends? In
no wise. And the cause was his love, which made the time, though long,
appear short. “For they were,” saith he, ([Gen. xxix.
20](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#020)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p29.1"></span>..md)
“in his sight as a few days.” So far was he from being galled and
blushing for this his bondage. Justly then said the blessed Paul, “Love
doth not behave itself unseemly.”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p30"></span>\[3.\] 1. “Seeketh not its own, is not
provoked.”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p31"></span>Thus having said, “doth not behave itself
unseemly,” he showeth also the temper of mind, on account of which she
doth not behave herself unseemly.   And what is that temper? That she
“seeketh not her own.” For the beloved she esteems to be all, and then
only “behaveth herself unseemly,” when she cannot free him from such
unseemliness; so that if it be possible by her own unseemliness to
benefit her beloved, she doth not so much as count the thing
unseemliness; for the other party thereafter is yourself, when you
love <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) : since this is friendship,
that the lover and the beloved should no longer be two persons divided,
but in a manner one single person; a thing which no how takes place
except from love. Seek not therefore thine own, that thou mayest find
thine own. For he that seeks his own, finds not his own. Wherefore also
Paul said, “Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbor’s good.” ([1
Cor. x. 24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p32.3"></span>.) For your own profit lies in the profit of
your neighbor, and his in yours. As therefore one that had his own gold
buried in the house of his neighbor, should he refuse to go and there
seek and dig it up, will never seek it; so likewise here, he that will
not seek his own profit in the advantage of his neighbor, will not
attain unto the crowns due to this: God Himself having therefore so
disposed of it, in order that we should be mutually bound together: and
even as one awakening a slumbering child to follow his brother, when he
is of himself unwilling, places in the brother’s hand that which he
desires and longs for, that through desire of obtaining it he may pursue
after him that holds it, and accordingly so it takes place: thus also
here, each man’s own profit hath he given to his neighbor, that hence we
may run after one another, and not be torn asunder.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p33"></span>And if thou wilt, see this also in our
case who address you. For my profit depends on thee, and thy advantage
on me. Thus, on the one hand it profits thee to be taught the things
that please God, but with this have I been entrusted, that thou mightest
receive it from me, and therefore mightest be compelled to run unto me;
and on the other hand it profits me that thou shouldest be made better:
for the reward which I shall receive for this will be great; but this
again lieth in thee; and therefore am I compelled to follow after thee
that thou mayest be better, and that I may receive my profit from thee.
Wherefore also Paul saith, “For what is my hope? are not even ye?” And
again, “My hope, and my joy, and the crown of my rejoicing.” ([1 Thess.
ii. 19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p33.1"></span>.) So that the joy of Paul was the disciples,
and his joy they had. Therefore he even wept when he saw them perishing.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p34"></span>Again their profit depended on Paul:
wherefore he said, “For the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
([Acts xxviii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p34.1"></span>.) And again, “These things I endure for the
elect’s sakes that they may obtain eternal life. ([2 Tim. ii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p34.2"></span>..md)
And this one may see in worldly things. “For the wife,” saith he, “hath
not power over her own body, nor yet the husband; but the wife over the
husband’s, and the husband over the wife’s.” ([1 Cor. vii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p34.3"></span>..md)
So likewise we, when we wish to bind any together, do this. We leave
neither of them in his own power, but extending a chain between them, we
cause the one to be holden of the other, and the other of the one. Wilt
thou also see this in the case of governors? He that judges sits not in
judgment for himself, but seeking the profit of his neighbor. The
governed on the other hand, seek the profit of the governor by their
attendance, by their ministry, by all the other things. Soldiers take up
their arms for us, for on our account they peril themselves. We for them
are in straits; for from us are their supplies.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p35"></span>But if thou sayest, “each one doth this
seeking his own,” this also say I, but I add, that by the good of
another one’s own is won. Thus both the soldier, unless he fight for
them that support him, hath none that ministers to him for this end: and
this same on the other hand, unless he nourish the soldier, hath none to
arm himself in his behalf.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p36"></span>\[4.\] Seest thou love, how it is
everywhere ex<span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="iv.xxxiv-Page_198"></span>tended and manages all things? But be not
weary, until thou have thoroughly acquainted thyself with this golden
chain. For having said, “seeketh not her own,” he mentions again the
good things produced by this. And what are these?

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p37"></span>“Is not easily provoked, thinketh no
evil. <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) ” See love again not only
subduing vice, but not even suffering it to arise at all. For he said
not, “though provoked, she overcomes,” but, “is not provoked.” And he
said not, “worketh no evil,” but, “not even thinketh;” i.e., so far from
contriving any evil, she doth not even suspect it of the beloved. How
then could she work any, or how be provoked? who doth not even endure to
admit an evil surmise; whence is the fountain of wrath.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p39"></span>[1 Cor.
13.6](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p39.1"></span>.
“Rejoiceth not in unrighteousness:” i.e., doth not feel pleasure over
those that suffer ill: and not this only, but also, what is much
greater, “rejoiceth with the truth.” “She feels pleasure,” saith he,
“with them that are well spoken of,” as Paul saith, “Rejoice with them
that rejoice, and weep with them that weep.” ([Rom. xii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p39.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p40"></span>Hence, she “envieth not,” hence she “is
not puffed up:” since in fact she accounts the good things <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) of others her own.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p42"></span>Seest thou how by degrees love makes her
nursling an angel? For when he is void of anger, and pure from envy, and
free from every tyrannical passion, consider that even from the nature
of man he is delivered from henceforth, and hath arrived at the very
serenity of angels.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p43"></span>Nevertheless, he is not content with
these, but hath something even more than these to say: according to his
plan of stating the stronger points later. Wherefore he saith, “beareth
all things.” From her long-suffering, from her goodness; whether they be
burdensome, or grievous, or insults, or stripes, or death, or whatsoever
else. And this again one may perceive from the case of blessed David.
For what could be more intolerable than to see a son rising up against
him, and aiming at the usurpation, and thirsting for a father’s blood?
Yet this did that blessed one endure, nor even so could he bear to throw
out one bitter expression against the parricide; but even when he left
all the rest to his captains, gave a strong injunction respecting his
safety. For strong was the foundation of his love. Wherefore also it
“beareth all things.”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p44"></span>Now its power the Apostle here intimates,
but its goodness, by what follows. For, “it hopeth all things,” saith
he, “believeth all things, endureth all things.” What is, “hopeth all
things?” It doth not despair,” saith he, “of the beloved, but even
though he be worthless, it continues to correct, to provide, to care for
him.”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p45"></span>“Believeth all things.” “For it doth not
merely hope,” saith he, “but also believeth from its great affection.”
And even if these good things should not turn out according to its hope,
but the other person should prove yet more intolerable, it bears even
these. For, saith he, it “endureth all things.”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p46"></span>\[5.\] [1 Cor.
13.8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p46.1"></span>.
“Love never faileth.”

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p47"></span>Seest thou when he put the crown on the
arch, and what of all things is peculiar to this gift? For what is,
“faileth not?” it is not severed, is not dissolved by endurance. For it
puts up with everything: since happen what will, he that loves never can
hate. This then is the greatest of its excellencies.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p48"></span>Such a person was Paul. Wherefore also he
said, “If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my
flesh;” ([Rom. xi. 14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p48.1"></span>.) and he continued hoping. And to Timothy he
gave a charge, saying, “And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be
gentle towards all.…in meekness correcting those that oppose themselves,
if God peradventure may give them the knowledge of the truth. <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) ” ([2 Tim.
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p49.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p50"></span>“What then,” saith one, “if they be
enemies and heathens, must one hate them?” One must hate, not them but
their doctrine: not the man, but the wicked conduct, the corrupt mind.
For the man is God’s work, but the deceit is the devil’s work. Do thou
not therefore confound the things of God and the things of the devil.
Since the Jews were both blasphemers, and persecutors, and injurious,
and spake ten thousand evil things of Christ. Did Paul then hate them,
he who of all men most loved Christ? In no wise, but he both loved them,
and did everything for their sakes: and at one time he saith, “My
heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them that they may be
saved:” ([Rom. 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md), [Rom.
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p50.1"></span>..md)
and at another, “I could wish that myself were anathema from Christ for
their sakes.” Thus also Ezekiel seeing them slain saith, “Alas, O Lord,
dost Thou blot out the remnant of Israel?” ([Ezek. ix.
8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p50.2"></span>..md)
And Moses, “If Thou wilt forgive their sin, forgive.” ([Exod. xxxii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p50.3"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p51"></span>Why then saith David, “Do not I hate
them, O Lord, that hate Thee, and against Thine enemies did I not pine
away? I hate them with perfect hatred.” ([Ps.
39:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#022)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p51.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p52"></span>Now, in the first place, not all things
spoken in the Psalms by David, are spoken in the person of David. For it
is he himself who saith, “I have dwelt in the tents of Kedar;” ([Ps.
cxx. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p52.1"></span>.) and, “By the waters of Babylon, there we
sat <span id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span
id="iv.xxxiv-Page_199"></span>down and wept:” ([Psa.
137.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p52.2"></span>.) yet he neither saw Babylon, nor the tents
of Kedar.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p53"></span>But besides this, we require now a
completer self-command. Wherefore also when the disciples besought that
fire might come down, even as in the case of Elias, “Ye know not,” saith
Christ, “what manner of spirit ye are of. ([Luke ix.
55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p53.1"></span>..md)
For at that time not the ungodliness only, but also the ungodly
themselves, they were commanded to hate, in order that their friendship
might not prove an occasion of transgression unto them. Therefore he
severed their connections, both by blood and marriage, and on every side
he fenced them off.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p54"></span>But now because he hath brought us to a
more entire self-command and set us on high above that mischief, he bids
us rather admit and soothe them. For we get no harm from them, but they
get good by us. What then doth he say? we must not hate, but pity. Since
if thou shalt hate, how wilt thou easily convert him that is in error?
how wilt thou pray for the unbeliever? for that one ought to pray, hear
what Paul saith: “I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications,
prayer, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men.” ([1 Tim. ii.

But that all were not then believers, is, I suppose, evident unto every
one. And again, “for kings and all that are in high place.” But that
these were ungodly and transgressors, this also is equally manifest.
Further, mentioning also the reason for the prayer, he adds, “for this
is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who willeth that
all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.”
Therefore, if he find a Gentile wife consorting with a believer, he
dissolves not the marriage. Yet what is more closely joined than a man
to his wife? “For they two shall be one flesh,” ([Gen. ii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p54.2"></span>..md)
and great in that instance is the charm, and ardent the desire. But if
we are to hate ungodly and lawless men, we shall go on to hate also
sinners; and thus in regular process thou wilt be broken off from the
most even of thy brethren, or rather from all: for there is not one, no,
not one, without sin. For if it be our duty to hate the enemies of God,
one must not hate the ungodly only, but also sinners: and thus we shall
be worse than wild beasts, shunning all, and puffed up with pride; even
as that Pharisee. But not thus did Paul command us, but how? “Admonish
the disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be long
suffering toward all.” ([1 Thess. v.
14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p54.3"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p55"></span>\[6.\] What then doth he mean when he
saith, “If any obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that
ye have no company with him?” ([2 Thess. iii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#014)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p55.1"></span>..md)
In the first place, he saith this of brethren, however not even so
without limitation, but this too with gentleness. For do not thou cut
off what follows, but subjoin also the next clause: how, having said,
“keep no company,” he added, “yet count him not as an enemy, but
admonish him as a brother.” Seest thou how he bade us hate the deed that
is evil, and not the man? For indeed it is the work of the devil to tear
us asunder from one another, and he hath ever used great diligence to
take away love that he may cut off the way of correction, and may retain
him in error and thee in enmity, and thus block up the way of his
salvation. For when both the physician hates the sick man and flies from
him, and the sick man turns away from the physician, when will the
distempered person be restored, seeing that neither the one will call in
the other’s aid, nor will the other go to him?

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p56"></span>But wherefore, tell me, dost thou at all
turn away from him and avoid him? Because he is ungodly? Truly for this
cause oughtest thou to welcome and attend him, that thou mayest raise
him up in his sickness. But if he be incurably sick, still thou hast
been bidden to do thy part. Since Judas also was incurably diseased, yet
God left not off attending upon him. Wherefore, neither do thou grow
weary. For even if after much labor thou fail to deliver him from his
ungodliness, yet shalt thou receive the deliverer’s reward, and wilt
cause him to wonder at thy gentleness, and so all this praise will pass
on to God. For though thou shouldest work wonders, and raise the dead,
and whatsoever work thou doest, the Heathen will never wonder at thee so
much, as when they see thee displaying a meek, gentle, mild disposition.
And this is no small achievement: since many will even be entirely
delivered from their evil way; there being nothing that hath such power
to allure men as love. For in respect of the former they will rather be
jealous of thee, I mean the signs and wonders; but for this they will
both admire and love thee: and if they love, they will also lay hold of
the truth in due course. If however he become not all at once a
believer, wonder not nor hurry on, neither do thou require all things at
once, but suffer him for the present to praise, and love, and unto this
in due course he will come.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p57"></span>\[7.\] And that thou mayest clearly know
how great a thing this is, hear how even Paul, going before an
unbelieving judge, made his defence. “I think myself happy,” saith he,
“That I am to make my defence before thee.” ([Acts xxvi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p57.1"></span>..md)
And these things he said, not to flatter him, far from it; but wishing
to gain him by his gentleness. And he did in part gain him, and he that
was till then considered to be condemned took captive his judge, and the
victory is confessed by the person himself who was <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span id="iv.xxxiv-Page_200"></span>made
captive, with a loud voice in the presence of all, saying, “With but
little persuasion thou wouldst fain make me a Christian.” ([Acts
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p57.2"></span>..md)
What then saith Paul? He spread his net the wider, and saith, “I would
to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, might
become such as I am, except these bonds.” What sayest thou, O Paul?
“except these bonds?” And what confidence remains for thee, if thou art
ashamed of these things, and fliest from them, and this before so great
a multitude? Dost thou not every where in thy Epistles boast of this
matter, and call thyself a prisoner? Dost thou not every where carry
about this chain in our sight as a diadem? What then hath happened now
that thou deprecatest these bonds? “I myself deprecate them not,” saith
he, “nor am I ashamed of them, but I condescend to their weakness. For
they are not yet able to receive my glorying; and I have learned from my
Lord not to put ‘a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment:’ (S.
[Matt. ix. 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p57.3"></span>.) therefore did I thus speak. For, in fact,
unto this time they have heard ill reports of our doctrine, and abhor
the cross. If therefore I should add also bonds, their hatred becometh
greater; I removed these, therefore, that the other might be made
acceptable. So it is, that to them it seems disgraceful to be bound,
because they have not as yet tasted of the Glory which is with us. One
must therefore condescend: and when they shall have learned of the true
life, then will they know the beauty also of this iron, and the lustre
which comes of these bonds.” Furthermore, discoursing with others, he
even calls the thing a free gift, saying, “It hath been granted in the
behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer in His
behalf.” ([Philip. i. 29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p57.4"></span>.) But for the time then present, it was a
great thing for the hearers not to be ashamed of the cross: for which
cause he goes on gradually. Thus, neither doth any one introducing a
person to a palace, before that he beholds the vestibule, compel him,
yet standing without, to survey what is within: since in that way it
will not even seem admirable, unless one enter in and so acquaint one’s
self with all.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p58"></span>So then let us also deal with the heathen
sort:  with condecension, with love. For love is a great teacher, and
able both to withdraw men from error, and to reform the character, and
to lead them by the hand unto self-denial, and out of stones to make
men.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p59"></span>\[8.\] And if thou wouldest learn her
power, bring me a man timid and fearful of every sound, and trembling at
shadows; or passionate, and harsh, and a wild beast rather than a man;
or wanton and licentious; or wholly given to wickedness; and deliver him
into the hands of love, and introduce him into this school; and thou
wilt speedily see that cowardly and timid creature made brave and
magnanimous, and venturing upon all things cheerfully. And what is
wonderful, not from any change in nature do these things result, but in
the coward soul itself love manifests her peculiar power; and it is much
the same as if one should cause a leaden sword, not turned into steel
but continuing in the nature of lead, to do the work of steel. As thus:
Jacob was a “plain man <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) , ([Gen.
xxv. 27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p60.3"></span>.) dwelling in a house <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) , and unpracticed in toils and
dangers, living a kind of remiss and easy life, and like a virgin in her
chamber, so also he was compelled for the most part to sit within doors
and keep the house; withdrawn from the forum and all tumults of the
forum, and from all such matters, and even continuing in ease and
quietness. What then?  After that the torch of love had set him on fire,
see how it made this plain and home-keeping man strong to endure and
fond of toil. And of this hear not what I say, but what the patriarch
himself saith: how finding fault with his kinsman, his words are, “These
twenty years am I with thee.” ([Gen. xxxi.
36](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#036)<span id="iv.xxxiv-p61.2"></span>..md)
And how wert thou these twenty years? (For this also he adds,) “Consumed
by the heat in the day time, and with the frost by night, and sleep
departed from mine eyes.” Thus speaks that “plain man, keeping at home,”
and living that easy life.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p62"></span>Again, that he was timid is evident, in
that, expecting to see Esau, he was dead with fear. But see again, how
this timid man became bolder than a lion under the influence of love.
For putting himself forward like some champion before the rest, he was
ready to be first in receiving that savage and slaughter-breathing
brother as he supposed him to be, and with his own body to purchase the
safety of his wives: and him whom he feared and shuddered at, he desired
to behold himself foremost in the array. For this fear was not so strong
as his affection for his wives. Seest thou how, being timid, he became
suddenly adventurous, not by changing his character, but being
invigorated by love? For that after this also he was timid, is evident
by his changing from place to place.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p63"></span>But let no man consider what has been
said to be a charge against that righteous man: since being timid is no
reproach, for this is a man’s nature; but the doing any thing unseemly
for timidity’s sake. For it is possible for one that is timid by nature
to become courageous through piety. What did Moses? Did he not, through
fear of a single Egyptian, fly, and go away into banishment?
Nevertheless, this fugitive who could not endure the menace <span
id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span id="iv.xxxiv-Page_201"></span>of a
single man, after that he tasted of the honey of love, nobly and without
compulsion from any man, was forward to perish together with them whom
he loved. “For if thou wilt forgive their sin,” saith he, “forgive; and
if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of Thy book which thou hast written.
([Exod. xxxii. 32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p63.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p64"></span>\[9.\] Moreover, that love makes also the
fierce moderate, and the wanton chaste, we have no longer need of any
examples: this being evident to all men. Though a man be more savage
than any wild beast, no sheep so gentle as he is rendered by love. Thus,
what could be more savage and frantic than Saul?  But when his daughter
let his enemy go, he uttered not against her even a bitter word. And he
that unsparingly put to the sword all the priests for David’s sake,
seeing that his daughter had sent him away from the house, was not
indignant with her even as far as words; and this when so great a fraud
had been contrived against him: because he was restrained by the
stronger bridle of love.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p65"></span>Now as moderation, so chastity, is an
ordinary effect of love. If a man love his own wife as he ought to love,
even though he be never so much inclined to wantoness, he will not
endure to look upon another woman, on account of his affection for her.
“For love,” ([Song of Sol. 8.5](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiv-p65.1"></span>.) saith one, “is strong as death.” So that
from no other source doth wanton behavior arise than from want of love.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p66"></span>Since then love is the Artificer of all
virtue, let us with all exactness implant her in our own souls, that she
may produce for us many blessings, and that we may have her fruit
continually abounding, the fruit which is ever fresh and never decays.
For thus shall we obtain no less than eternal blessings: which may we
all obtain, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father, and also the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, and honor,
now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p27"></span> This view of Rebecca’s conduct is
generally sanctioned by the Fathers: so St. Augustin: “That which Jacob
did by direction of his mother so as to appear to deceive his father, if
you consider it diligently and faithfully, ‘non est mendacium sed
mysterium.’ And if we term that sort of thing a lie, by the same rule we
must also account as lies all parables and figures whatsoever.” *contr.
Mendac. ad Consentium*, c. 24. St. Ambrose, (*de Jacob et vita beata*,
ii. 6.) “In the mind of that pious mother the mystery overweighed the
tie of affection. She was not so much preferring Jacob to his brother,
as offering him to the Lord, who, she knew, had power to preserve the
gift presented unto Him.” This seems to mean that in consecrating Jacob
to be the first-born, she knowingly separated him from herself, and so
made a greater sacrifice. S. Chrys. himself says, “Rebecca did this not
of her own mind, but in obedience to the divine oracle,” (on *Gen*. Hom.
liii. 1. 414.) And he proceeds to point out God’s hand in certain minute
details of the transaction. It appears from St. Jerome, (1.169.) that
Hippolytus, Irenæus’ disciple, early in the third century, took the same
view. St. Gregory Nazianzen seems to be the only writer who has left a
contrary judgment on record: saying, “he pursued a noble object by
ignoble means.” The general result of the reflections of the Fathers on
the subject seems to be, that as where we have God’s express command or
approbation, we are sure of the rectitude of what would otherwise be
wrong, so there may be circumstances rendering such command or
approbation more or less “probable,” which ought at least to stay us
from censure: and that marked providential interference, and mysterious
allusion, throughout, are to be considered as such circumstances.

<span id="iv.xxxiv-p28"></span>\[In the foregoing note the translator
has correctly stated the patristic view of Rebecca’s conduct, a view
which most moderns heartily reject as dishonoring to God and of evil
influence upon his people. But while we cannot with Chrysostom cite the
wife of Jacob as an example of love, yet there is some extenuation for
her. The case is neatly stated by the Bishop of Ely in the Speaker’s
Commentary. “Rebekah had no doubt treasured up the oracle which had
assured her, even before their birth, that her younger son Jacob whom
she loved should bear rule over Esau, whose wild and reckless life and
whose Canaanitish wives had been a bitterness of soul to her. She
probably knew that Jacob had bought Esau’s birthright. Now believing
rightly that the father’s benediction would surely bring blessing with
it, she fears that these promises and hopes would fail. She believed but
not with that faith which can patiently abide till God works out his
plans by His providence. So she strove, as it were, to force forward the
event by unlawful means; even, as some have thought that Judas betrayed
Christ that he might free Him to declare Himself a king and take the
kingdom.” Every character in the history comes in for some share of
blame, but the greatest seems due to her who originated the whole plot,
who swept away the scruples of her favorite son, and taught him to
perpetrate the boldest fraud and falsehood upon his venerable father.
The overweening idolatrous affection which led to such doings is very
different from the love which the Apostle inculcates and praises. C.\]
