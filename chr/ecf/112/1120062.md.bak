class="c1"><span id="v.xiii-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor.
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xiii-p3"></span>Our mouth is open unto you, O ye
Corinthians, our heart is enlarged, ye are not straitened in us, but ye
are straitened in your own affections.

<span id="v.xiii-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.xiii-p4.1"></span>Having</span> detailed his own trials and
afflictions, for “in patience,” saith he, “in afflictions, in
necessities, in distresses, ([2 Cor.
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005)<span id="v.xiii-p4.2"></span>..md) in
stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult, in labors, in watchings;” and
having shown that the thing was a great good, for “as sorrowful,” saith
he, “yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having
nothing, and yet possessing all things;” ([2 Cor.
6.10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010)<span id="v.xiii-p4.3"></span>..md)
and having called those things “armor,” for “as chastened,” saith he,
“and not killed:” and having hereby represented God’s abundant care and
power, for he saith, “that the exceeding greatness of the power may be
of God, and not of us;” (c. [2 Cor.
4.7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007)<span id="v.xiii-p4.4"></span>..md)
and having recounted his labors, for he saith, “we always bear about His
dying;” and that this is a clear demonstration of the Resurrection, for
he says, “that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal
flesh;” (c. [2 Cor. 4.10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p4.5"></span>.) and of what things he was made partaker, and
with what he had been entrusted, for “we are ambassadors on behalf of
Christ,” (c. [2 Cor. 3.20](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p4.6"></span>.) saith he, “as though God were entreating by
us;” and of what things he is a minister, namely, “not of the letter,
but of the Spirit;” (c. [2 Cor.
3.6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)<span id="v.xiii-p4.7"></span>..md)
and that he was entitled to reverence not only on this account, but also
for his trials, for, “Thanks be to God,” saith he, “which always causeth
us to triumph:” he purposeth now also to rebuke them as not being too
well minded towards himself. But though purposing he does not
immediately come upon this, but having his discussion of these things.
For if even from his own good deeds he that rebuketh be entitled to
reverence; yet still, when he also displayeth the love, which he bears
towards those who are censured, he maketh his speech less offensive.
Therefore the Apostle also having stepped out of the subject of his own
trials and toils and contests, passes on into speaking of his love, and
in this way toucheth them to the quick. What then are the indications of
his love? “Our mouth is open unto you, O ye Corinthians.” And what kind
of sign of love is this? or what meaning even have the words at all? ‘We
cannot endure,’ he says, ‘to be silent towards you, but are always
desiring and longing to speak to and converse with you;’ which is the
wont of those who love. For what grasping of the hands is to the body,
that is interchange of language to the soul. And along with this he
implies another thing also. Of what kind then is this? That ‘we
discourse unto nothing.’ For since afterwards he proposes to rebuke, he
asks forgiveness, using the rebuking them with freedom as itself a proof
of his loving them exceedingly. Moreover the addition of their name is a
mark of great love and warmth and affection; for we are accustomed to be
repeating continually the bare names of those we love.

<span id="v.xiii-p5"></span>“Our heart is enlarged.” For as that which
warmeth is wont to dilate; so also to enlarge is the work of love. For
virtue is warm and fervent. This both opened the mouth of Paul and
enlarged his heart. For, ‘neither do I love with the mouth only,’ saith
he, ‘but I have also a heart in union. Therefore I speak with openness,
with my whole mouth, with my whole mind.’ For nothing is wider than was
Paul’s heart which loved all the faithful with all the vehemence that
one might bear towards the object of his affection; this his love not
being divided and therefore weakened, but abiding in full entireness
with each. And what marvel that this was so in the case of the faithful,
seeing that even in that of the unfaithful, the heart of Paul embraced
the whole world? Therefore he said not ‘I love you,’ but with more
emphasis, “Our mouth is open, our heart is enlarged,” we have you all
within it, and not this merely, but with much largeness of room <span
id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) . For he that is beloved walketh with
great unrestraint within the heart of him that loveth. Wherefore he
saith, “Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straightened in your own
affections.” And this reproof, see it administered with forbearance, as
is the wont of such as love exceed<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>
<span id="v.xiii-Page_343"></span>ingly. He did not say, ‘ye do not love
us,’ but, ‘not in the same measure,’ for he does not wish to touch them
too sensibly. And indeed every where one may see how he is inflamed
toward the faithful, by selecting words out of every Epistle. For to the
Romans he saith, “I long to see you;” and, “oftentimes I purposed to
come unto you;” and, “If by any means now at length I may be prospered
to come unto you.” ([Rom. 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010)<span id="v.xiii-p6.2"></span>..md)
And to the Galatians, he says, “My little children of whom I am again in
travail.” ([Gal. iv. 19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p6.3"></span>.) To the Ephesians again, “For this cause I bow
my knees” for you. ([Eph. iii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p6.4"></span>.) And to the Philippians, <span
id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md) “For what is my hope, or joy, or crown
of rejoicing? are not even ye?” and he said that he bare them about in
his heart, and <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) in his bonds.
([Philip. i. 7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p8.1"></span>.) And to the Colossians, “But I would that ye
knew greatly I strive for you, and for as many as have not seen my face
in the flesh; that your hearts might be comforted.” ([Col.
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002)<span id="v.xiii-p8.2"></span>..md) And
to the Thessalonians, “As when a nurse cherisheth her children, even so
being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart
unto you, not the Gospel only, but also our own souls.” ([1 Thess.
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008)<span id="v.xiii-p8.3"></span>..md) And
to Timothy, “Remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy.” ([2
Tim. i. 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p8.4"></span>.) And to Titus, “To my beloved <span
id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) son; ([Titus i.
4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004)<span id="v.xiii-p9.1"></span>..md) and
to Philemon, in like manner. ([Philem.
1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001)<span id="v.xiii-p9.2"></span>..md) And
to the Hebrews too, he writes many other such-like things, and ceaseth
not to beseech them, and say, “A very little while, and he that cometh
shall come, and shall not tarry:” ([Heb. x.
37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037)<span id="v.xiii-p9.3"></span>..md)
just like a mother to her pettish <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) children. And to themselves <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) he says, “Ye are not straitened in
us.” But he does not say only that he loves, but also that he is beloved
by them, in order that hereby also he may the rather win them. And
indeed testifying to this in them, he says, Titus came and “told us your
longing, your mourning, your zeal.” ([2 Cor. vii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#007)<span id="v.xiii-p11.1"></span>..md) And
to the Galatians, “If possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and
given them to me,” ([Gal. iv. 15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p11.2"></span>.) And to the Thessalonians, “What manner of
entering in we had unto you.” ([1 Thess. i.
9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009)<span id="v.xiii-p11.3"></span>..md) And
to Timothy also, “Remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy.”
([2 Tim. i. 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.xiii-p11.4"></span>.) And also throughout his Epistles one may
find him bearing this testimony to the disciples, both that he loved and
that he is loved, not however equally. And here he saith, “Though the
more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.” ([2 Cor. xii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015)<span id="v.xiii-p11.5"></span>..md)
This, however, is near the end; but at present more vehemently, “Ye are
not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections,”
‘You receive one,’ he says, ‘but I a whole city, and so great a
population.’ And he said not, ‘ye do not receive us,’ but, ‘ye are
straitened;’ implying indeed the same thing but with forbearance and
without touching them too deeply.

<span id="v.xiii-p12"></span>[2 Cor.
6.13](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#013.md)<span id="v.xiii-p12.1"></span>.
“Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children,) be ye
also enlarged.”

<span id="v.xiii-p13"></span>And yet it is not an equal return, first to
be loved, afterwards to love. For even if one were to contribute that
which is equal in amount, he is inferior in that he comes to it second.
‘But nevertheless I am not going to reckon strictly, <span
id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) ’ saith he, ‘and if ye after having
received the first advances <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md) from
me do but show forth the same amount, I am well-pleased and contented.’
Then to show that to do this was even a debt, and that what he said was
void of flattery, he saith, “I speak as unto my children.” What meaneth,
“as unto my children?” ‘I ask no great thing, if being your father I
wish to be loved by you.’ And see wisdom and moderation of mind. He
mentions not here his dangers on their behalf, and his labors, and his
deaths, although he had many to tell of: (so free from pride is he!) but
his love: and on this account he claims to be loved; ‘because,’ saith
he, ‘I was your father, because I exceedingly burn for you,’ \[for\] it
is often especially offensive to the person beloved when a man sets
forth his benefits to him; for he seems to reproach. Wherefore Paul doth
not this; but,  ‘like children, love your father,’ saith he, which
rather proceeds from instinct <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) ;
and is the due of every father. Then that he may not seem to speak these
things for his own sake, he shows that it is for their advantage even
that he invites this love from them. And therefore he added,

<span id="v.xiii-p17"></span>[2 Cor.
6.14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014.md)<span id="v.xiii-p17.1"></span>.
“Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.”

<span id="v.xiii-p18"></span>He said not, ‘Intermix not with
unbelievers,’ but rather dealing sharply with <span
id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) them, as transgressing what was right,
‘Suffer not yourselves to turn aside,’ saith he, “For what fellowship
have righteousness and iniquity?” Here in what follows he institutes a
comparison, not between his own love and theirs who corrupt them, but
between their nobleness and the others’ dishonor. For thus his discourse
became more dignified and more beseeming himself, and would the rather
win them. Just as if one should say to a son that <span id="page_344">p.
344</span> <span id="v.xiii-Page_344"></span>despised his parents, and
gave himself up to vicious persons, ‘What art thou doing, child? Dost
thou despise thy father and prefer impure men filled with ten thousand
vices? Knowest thou not how much better and more respectable thou art
than they?’ For so he detaches him more \[readily\] from their society
than if he should express admiration of his father. For were he to say
indeed, ‘Knowest thou not how much thy father is better than they?’ he
will not produce so much effect; but if, leaving mention of his father,
he bring himself before them, saying, ‘Knowest thou not who thou art and
what they are? Dost thou not bear in mind thine own high birth and
gentle <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) blood, and their infamy?
For what communion hast thou with them, those thieves, those adulterers,
those impostors?’ by elevating him with these praises of himself, he
will quickly prepare him to break off from them. For the former address
indeed, he will not entertain with overmuch acceptance, because the
exalting of his father is an accusation of himself, when he is shown to
be not only grieving a father, but such a father; but in this case he
will have no such feeling. For none would choose not to be praised, and
therefore, along with these praises of him that hears, the rebuke
becometh easy of digestion. For the listener is softened, and is filled
with high thoughts, and disdains <span id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md)
the society of those persons.

<span id="v.xiii-p22"></span>But not this only is the point to be
admired in him that thus he prosecuted his comparison, but that he
imagined another thing also still greater and more astounding; in the
first place, prosecuting his speech in the form of interrogation, which
is proper to things that are clear and admitted, and then dilating it by
the quick succession and multitude of his terms. For he employs not one
or two or three only, but several. Add to this that instead of the
persons he employs the names of the things, and he delineates here high
virtue and there extreme vice; and shows the difference between them to
be great and infinite so as not even to need demonstration. “For what
fellowship,” saith he, “have righteousness and iniquity?”

<span id="v.xiii-p23"></span>“And what communion hath light with
darkness?” ([2 Cor. 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016)<span id="v.xiii-p23.1"></span>..md)
“And what concord hath Christ with Beliar <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) ? Or what portion <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) hath a believer with an unbeliever? Or
what agreement hath a temple of God with idols?”

<span id="v.xiii-p26"></span>Seest thou how he uses the bare names, and
how adequately to his purpose of dissuasion. For he did not say,
‘neglect of righteousness <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md) ,’
\[but\] what was stronger \[iniquity <span
id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) \]; nor did he say those who are of
the light, and those who are of the darkness; but he uses opposites
themselves which can not admit of their opposites, ‘light and darkness.’
Nor said he those who are of Christ, with those who are of the devil;
but, which was far wider apart, Christ and Beliar, so calling that
apostate one, in the Hebrew tongue. “Or what portion hath a believer
with an unbeliever?” Here, at length, that he may not seem simply to be
going through a censure of vice and an encomium of virtue, he mentions
persons also without particularizing. And he said not, ‘communion,’ but
spoke of the rewards, using the term “portion. What agreement hath a
temple of God with idols?”

<span id="v.xiii-p29"></span>“For ye <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) are a temple of the living God.” Now
what he says is this. Neither hath your King aught in common with him,
“for what concord hath Christ with Beliar?” nor have the things \[aught
in common\], “for what communion hath light with darkness?” Therefore
neither should ye. And first he mentions their king and then themselves;
by this separating them most effectually. Then having said, “a temple of
God with idols,” and having declared, “For ye are a temple of the living
God,” he is necessitated to subjoin also the testimony of this to show
that the thing is no flattery. For he that praises except he also
exhibit proof, even appears to flatter. What then is his testimony? For,

<span id="v.xiii-p31"></span>“I will dwell in them,” saith he, “and walk
in them. I will dwell in,” as in temples, “and walk in them,” signifying
the more abundant attachment <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) to
them.

<span id="v.xiii-p33"></span>“And they shall be my people and I will be
their God <span id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) .” ‘What?’ saith he,
‘Dost thou bear God within thee, and runnest unto them? God That hath
nothing in common with them?  And in what can this deserve forgiveness?
Bear in mind Who walketh, Who dwelleth in thee.’

<span id="v.xiii-p35"></span>[2 Cor.
6.17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017.md)<span id="v.xiii-p35.1"></span>.
“Wherefore come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch no
unclean thing; and I will receive you, saith the Lord.

<span id="v.xiii-p36"></span>And He said not, ‘Do not unclean things;’
but, requiring greater strictness, ‘do not even touch,’ saith he, ‘nor
go near them.’ But what is filthiness of the flesh?  Adultery,
fornication, lasciviousness of every kind. And what of the soul? Unclean
thoughts, as gazing with unchaste eyes, malice, deceits, and whatsoever
such things there be. He wishes then that they should be clean in both.
Seest thou how great the prize?  To be delivered from what is evil,
<span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span id="v.xiii-Page_345"></span>to
be made one with God. Hear also what follows.

<span id="v.xiii-p37"></span>[2 Cor.
6.18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018.md)<span id="v.xiii-p37.1"></span>.
“And I will be to you a Father, and ye shall be to me sons and
daughters, saith the Lord.”

<span id="v.xiii-p38"></span>Seest thou how from the beginning the
Prophet fore-announceth our present high birth, the Regeneration by
grace?

<span id="v.xiii-p39"></span>[2 Cor.
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md)<span id="v.xiii-p39.1"></span>.
“Having therefore these promises, beloved.”

<span id="v.xiii-p40"></span>What promises? That we should be temples of
God, sons and daughters, have Him indwelling, and walking in us, be His
people, have Him for our God and Father.

<span id="v.xiii-p41"></span>“Let us cleanse ourselves from all
defilement of flesh and spirit.”

<span id="v.xiii-p42"></span>Let us neither touch unclean things, for
this is cleansing of the flesh; nor things which defile the soul, for
this is cleansing of the spirit. Yet he is not content with this only,
but adds also,

<span id="v.xiii-p43"></span>“Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”
For not to touch the unclean thing doth not make clean, but there
needeth something else besides to our becoming holy; earnestness,
heedfulness, piety. And he well said, “In the fear of God.” For it is
possible to perfect chasteness, not in the fear of God but for
vainglory. And along with this he implies yet another thing, by saying,
“In the fear of God;” the manner, namely, whereafter holiness may be
perfected. For if lust be even an imperious thing, still if thou occupy
its territory with <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) the fear of
God, thou hast stayed its frenzy.

<span id="v.xiii-p45"></span>\[4.\] Now by holiness here he means not
chastity alone, but the freedom from every kind of sin, for he is holy
that is pure. Now one will become pure, not if he be free from
fornication only, but if from covetousness also, and envy, and
pride <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) , and vainglory, yea
especially from vainglory which in every thing indeed it behoveth to
avoid, but much more in almsgiving; since neither will it be almsgiving,
if it have this distemper, but display and cruelty. For when thou dost
it not out of mercy, but from parade <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) , such deed is not only no alms but
even an insult; for thou hast put thy brother to open shame <span
id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) . Not then the giving money, but the
giving it out of mercy, is almsgiving. For people too at the theatres
give, both to prostitute boys and to others who are on the stage; but
such a deed is not almsgiving. And they too give that abuse the persons
of prostitute women; but this is not lovingkindness, but insolent
treatment <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) . Like this is the
vainglorious also. For just as he that abuseth the person of the harlot,
pays her a price for that abuse; so too dost thou demand a price of him
that receiveth of thee, thine insult of him and thine investing him as
well as thyself with an evil notoriety. And besides this, the loss is
unspeakable. For just as a wild beast and a mad dog springing upon us
might, so doth this ill disease and this inhumanity make prey of our
good things. For inhumanity and cruelty such a course is; yea, rather
more grievous even than this. For the cruel indeed would not give to him
that asked; but thou dost more than this; thou hinderest those that wish
to give. For when thou paradest thy giving, thou hast both lowered the
reputation of the receiver, and hast pulled back <span
id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) him that was about to give, if he be
of a careless mind. For he will not give to him thenceforth, on the
ground of his having already received, and so not being in want; yea he
will often accuse him even, if after having received he should draw near
to beg, and will think him impudent. What sort of almsgiving then is
this when thou both shamest thyself and him that receiveth; and also in
two ways Him that enjoined it:  both because while having Him for a
spectator of thine alms, thou seekest the eyes of thy fellow-servants
besides Him, and because thou transgressest the law laid down by Him
forbidding these things.

<span id="v.xiii-p51"></span>I could have wished to carry this out into
those other subjects as well, both fasting and prayer, and to show in
how many respects vainglory is injurious there also; but I remember that
in the discourse before this I left unfinished a certain necessary
point. What was the point? I was saying, that the poor have the
advantage of the rich in the things of this life, when I discoursed
concerning health and pleasure; and this was shown indistinctly. Come
then, to-day let us show this, that not in the things of this life only,
but also in those that are higher, the advantage is with them. For what
leadeth unto a kingdom, riches or poverty? Let us hear the Lord Himself
of the heavens saying of those, that “it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of heaven:” ([Matt. xix.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#024)<span id="v.xiii-p51.1"></span>..md)
but of the poor the contrary, “If thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou
hast, and give to the poor; and come, follow Me; and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven.” ([Matt. xix.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021)<span id="v.xiii-p51.2"></span>..md)
But if ye will, let us see what is said on either side. “Narrow and
straitened is the way,” He saith, “that leadeth unto life.” ([Matt. vii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014)<span id="v.xiii-p51.3"></span>..md)
Who then treadeth the narrow way, he that is in luxury, or that is in
poverty; that is independent, or that carrieth ten thousand burdens; the
lax <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md) and dissolute, or the
thoughtful and anxious? <span id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span
id="v.xiii-Page_346"></span>But what need of these arguments, when it is
best to betake one’s self to the persons themselves. Lazarus was poor,
yea very poor; and he that passed him by as he lay at his gateway was
rich. Which then entered into the kingdom, and was in delights in
Abraham’s bosom? and which of them was scorched, with not even a drop at
his command? But, saith one, ‘both many poor will be lost, and \[many\]
rich will enjoy those unspeakable goods.’ Nay rather, one may see the
contrary, few rich saved, but of the poor far more. For, consider,
making accurate measure of the hindrances of riches and the defects of
poverty, (or rather, neither of riches nor of poverty are they, but each
of those who have riches or poverty; howbeit,) let us at least see which
is the more available weapon. What defect then doth poverty seem to
possess? Lying. And what, wealth? Pride, the mother of evils; which also
made the devil a devil, who was not such before. Again, “the love of
money is a root of all kinds of evil.” ([1 Tim. vi.
10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010)<span id="v.xiii-p52.2"></span>..md)
Which then stands near this root, the rich man, or the poor? Is it not
very plainly the rich? For the more things anyone surrounds himself
with, he desires so much the more. Vainglory again damages tens of
thousands of good deeds, and near this too again the rich man hath his
dwelling <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) . “But,” saith one,
“thou mentionest not the \[evils\] of the poor man, his affliction, his
straits.” Nay, but this is both common to the rich, and is his more than
the poor man’s; so that those indeed which appear to be evils of poverty
are common to either: whilst those of riches are riches’ only. ‘But
what,’ saith one, ‘when for want of necessaries the poor man committeth
many horrible things?’ But no poor man, no, not one, committeth as many
horrible things from want, as do the rich for the sake of surrounding
themselves with more, and of not losing what stores they have <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) . For the poor man doth not so eagerly
desire necessaries as the rich doth superfluities; nor again has he as
much strength to put wickedness in practice as the other hath power. If
then the rich man is both more willing and able, it is quite plain that
he will rather commit such, and more of them. Nor is the poor man so
much afraid in respect of hunger, as the rich trembleth and is anxious
in respect of the loss of what he has, and because he has not yet gotten
all men’s possessions. Since then he is near both vainglory and
arrogance, and the love of money, the root of all evils, what hope of
salvation shall he have except he display much wisdom? And how shall he
walk the narrow way? Let us not therefore carry about the notions of the
many, but examine into the facts. For how is it not absurd that in
respect to money, indeed, we do not trust to others, but refer this to
figures and calculation; but in calculating upon facts we are lightly
drawn aside by the notions of others; and that too, though we possess an
exact balance <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) , and square <span
id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) and rule <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) for all things, the declaration of the
divine laws? Wherefore I exhort and entreat you all, disregard what this
man and that man thinks about these things, and inquire from the
Scriptures all these things; and having learnt what are the true riches,
let us pursue after them that we may obtain also the eternal good
things; which may we all obtain, through the grace and love towards men
of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the Father and the Holy Spirit,
be glory, might, and honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
