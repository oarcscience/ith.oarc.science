<span id="v.xvii"></span>

<span id="v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Homily XVII.</span>

<span id="v.xvii-p2"></span><span id="v.xvii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.xvii-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor. viii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#007.md)<span id="v.xvii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.xvii-p3"></span>Therefore that <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) ye abound <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) in every thing; in faith and
utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness.

<span id="v.xvii-p6"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.xvii-p6.1"></span>See</span> again his exhortation accompanied
with commendations, greater commendations. And he said not, ‘that ye
give,’ but “that ye abound; in faith,” namely, of the gifts, and “in
utterance,” the word of wisdom, and “knowledge,” namely, of the
doctrines, and “in all earnestness,” to the attaining of all other
virtue.

<span id="v.xvii-p7"></span>“And in your love,” that, namely of which I
have before spoken, of which I have also made proof.

<span id="v.xvii-p8"></span>“That ye may abound in this grace also.”
Seest thou that for this reason it was that he began by those praises,
that advancing forward he might draw them on to the same diligence in
these things also.

<span id="v.xvii-p9"></span>[2 Cor.
8.8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008.md)<span id="v.xvii-p9.1"></span>. “I
speak not by way of commandment.”

<span id="v.xvii-p10"></span>See how constantly he humors them, how he
avoids offensiveness, and is not violent nor compulsory; or rather what
he says hath both these, with the inoffensiveness of that which is
uncompelled. For after he had repeatedly exhorted them and had greatly
commended the Macedonians, in order that this might not seem to
constitute a necessity, he says,

<span id="v.xvii-p11"></span>“I speak not by way of commandment, but as
proving through the earnestness of others, the sincerity also of your
love.”

<span id="v.xvii-p12"></span>‘Not as doubting it,’ (for that is not what
he would here imply,) ‘but to make it approved, display it and frame it
unto greater strength. For I therefore say these things that I may
provoke you to the same forwardness. And I <span id="page_360">p.
360</span> <span id="v.xvii-Page_360"></span>mention their zeal to
brighten, to cheer, to stimulate your inclinations.’ Then from this he
proceeded to another and a greater point. For he lets slip no mode of
persuasion, but moves heaven and earth <span
id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md) in handling his argument. For he
exhorted them both by other men’s praises, saying, Ye know “the grace of
God which hath been given in the Churches of Macedonia;” and by their
own, “therefore that ye abound in everything, in utterance and
knowledge.” For this hath power to sting man more that he falls short of
himself, than that he does so of others. Then he proceeds afterwards to
the head and crown of his persuasion.

<span id="v.xvii-p14"></span>[2 Cor.
8.9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md)<span id="v.xvii-p14.1"></span>.
“For ye know the grace of our Lord, that though He was rich, yet for our
sakes He became poor, that we through His poverty might become rich.”

<span id="v.xvii-p15"></span>‘For have in mind,’ says he, ‘ponder and
consider the grace of God and do not lightly pass it by, but aim at
realizing <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) the greatness of it
both as to extent and nature <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) ,
and thou wilt grudge nothing of thine. He emptied Himself of His glory
that ye, not through His riches but through His poverty, might be rich.
If thou believest not that poverty is productive of riches, have in mind
thy Lord and thou wilt doubt no longer. For had He not become poor, thou
wouldest not have become rich. For this is the marvel, that poverty hath
made riches rich.’ And by riches here he meaneth the knowledge of
godliness, the cleansing away of sins, justification, sanctification,
the countless good things which He bestowed upon us and purposeth to
bestow. And all these things accrued to us through His poverty. What
poverty? Through His taking flesh on Him and becoming man and suffering
what He suffered. And yet he owed not this, but thou dost owe to Him.

<span id="v.xvii-p18"></span>[2 Cor.
8.10](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#010.md)<span id="v.xvii-p18.1"></span>.
“And herein I give you <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) my advice
for your profit.”

<span id="v.xvii-p20"></span>See how again he is careful to give no
offence and softens down what he says, by these two things, by saying,
“I give advice,” and, “for your profit.” ‘For, neither do I compel and
force you,’ says he, ‘or demand it from unwilling subjects; nor do I say
these things with an eye so much to the receivers benefit as to yours.’
Then the instance also which follows is drawn from themselves, and not
from others.

<span id="v.xvii-p21"></span>“Who were the first to make a beginning a
year ago, not only to do, but also to will.”

<span id="v.xvii-p22"></span>See how he shows both that themselves were
willing, and had come to this resolution without persuasion. For since
he had borne this witness to the Thessalonians, that “of their own
accord with much intreaty,” they had prosecuted this giving of alms; he
is desirous of showing of these also that this good work is their own.
Wherefore he said, “not only to do, but also to will,” and not “begun,”
but “begun before, a year ago.” Unto these things therefore I exhort
you, whereunto ye beforehand bestirred yourselves with all forwardness.

<span id="v.xvii-p23"></span>[2 Cor.
8.11](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#011.md)<span id="v.xvii-p23.1"></span>.
“And now also ye have completed <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md)
the doing of it.”

<span id="v.xvii-p25"></span>He said not, ye have done it, but, ye have
put a completion to it,

<span id="v.xvii-p26"></span>“That as there was the readiness to will,
so also \[there may be\] the completion also out of your ability.”

<span id="v.xvii-p27"></span>That this good work halt not at readiness
but receive also the reward that follows upon deeds.

<span id="v.xvii-p28"></span>\[2.\] [2 Cor.
8.12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xvii-p28.1"></span>.
“For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man
hath, not according as he hath not.”

<span id="v.xvii-p29"></span>See wisdom unspeakable. In that (having
pointed out those who were doing beyond their power, I mean the
Thessalonians, and having praised them for this and said, “I bear them
record that even beyond their power;”) he exhorteth the Corinthians to
do only “after” their power, leaving the example to do its own work; for
he knew that not so much exhortation, as emulation, inciteth unto
imitation of the like; wherefore he saith, “For if the readiness is
there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according as he
hath not.”

<span id="v.xvii-p30"></span>‘Fear not,’ he means, ‘because I have said
these things, for what I said was an encomium upon their
munificence <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) , but God requires
things after a man’s power,’ “according as he hath, not according as he
hath not.” For the word “is acceptable,” here implies ‘is required.’ And
he softens <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) it greatly, in
confident reliance upon this example, and as winning them more surely by
leaving them at liberty. Wherefore also he added,

<span id="v.xvii-p33"></span>[2 Cor.
8.13](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#013.md)<span id="v.xvii-p33.1"></span>.
“For I say not this, that others may be eased, and ye distressed.”

<span id="v.xvii-p34"></span>And yet Christ praised the contrary conduct
in the widow’s case, that she emptied out all of her living and gave out
of her want. ([Mark xii. 43](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#043.md)<span
id="v.xvii-p34.1"></span>.) But because he was discoursing to
Corinthians amongst whom he chose to suffer hunger; “for it were good
for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void;”
([1 Cor. ix. 15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.xvii-p34.2"></span>.) he therefore uses a tempered exhortation,
praising indeed those who had done beyond their power, but not
compelling these to do so; not because he <span id="page_361">p.
361</span> <span id="v.xvii-Page_361"></span>did not desire it, but
because they were somewhat weak. For wherefore doth he praise those,
because “in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and
their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality:” and
because they gave “beyond their power?” is it not very evident that it
is as inducing these also to this conduct? So that even if he appears to
permit a lower standard; he doth so, that by it he may raise them to
this. Consider, for instance, how even in what follows he is covertly
preparing the way for this. For having said these things, he added,

<span id="v.xvii-p35"></span>[2 Cor.
8.14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014.md)<span id="v.xvii-p35.1"></span>.
“Your abundance being a supply for their want.”

<span id="v.xvii-p36"></span>For not only by the words he has before
used but by these also, he is desirous of making the commandment light.
Nor yet from this consideration alone, but from that of the recompense
also, again he maketh it easier; and uttereth higher things than they
deserve, saying, “That there may be equality at this time, and their
abundance” a supply “for your want.” Now what is it that he saith? ‘Ye
are flourishing <span id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) in money; they
in life <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) and in boldness towards
God.’ ‘Give ye to them, therefore, of the money which ye abound in but
they have not; that ye may receive of that boldness wherein they are
rich and ye are lacking.’ See how he hath covertly prepared for their
giving beyond their power and of their want. ‘For,’ he saith, ‘if thou
desirest to receive of their abundance, give of thine abundance; but if
to win for thyself the whole, thou wilt give of thy want and beyond thy
power.’ He doth not say this, however, but leaves it to the reasoning of
his hearers; and himself meanwhile works out his object and the
exhortation that was meet, adding in keeping with what appeared, the
words, that “there may be equality at this time.” How equality? You and
they mutually giving your superabundance, and filling up your wants. And
what sort of equality is this, giving spiritual things for carnal? for
great is the advantage on that side; how then doth he call it
“equality?” either in respect of each abounding and wanting, doth he say
that this \[equality\] takes place; or else in respect of the present
life only. And therefore after saying “equality,” he added, “at this
time.” Now this he said, both to subdue the high-mindedness of the rich,
and to show that after our departure hence the spiritual possess the
greater advantage. For here indeed we all enjoy much equality of honor;
but then there will be a wide distinction and a very great superiority,
when the just shine brighter than the sun. Then since he showed that
they were to be not only giving, but also receiving, and more, in
return; he tries by a further consideration to make them forward,
showing that if they did not give of their substance to others, they
would not gain anything by gathering all together within. And he adduces
an ancient story, thus saying,

<span id="v.xvii-p39"></span>[2 Cor.
8.15](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#015.md)<span id="v.xvii-p39.1"></span>.
“As it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over, and he that
gathered little had no lack.”

<span id="v.xvii-p40"></span>Now this happened in the case of the manna.
For both they that gathered more, and they that gathered less, were
found to have the same quantity, God in this way punishing
insatiableness. And this he said at once both to alarm them by what then
happened, and to persuade them never to desire to have more nor to
grieve at having less. And this one may see happening now in things of
this life not in the manna only. For if we all fill but one belly, and
live the same length of time, and clothe one body; neither will the rich
gain aught by his abundance nor the poor lose aught by his poverty.

<span id="v.xvii-p41"></span>\[3.\] Why then tremblest thou at poverty?
and why pursuest thou after wealth? ‘I fear,’ saith one, ‘lest I be
compelled to go to other men’s doors and to beg from my neighbor.’ And I
constantly hear also many praying to this effect, and saying, ‘Suffer me
not at any time to stand in need of men?’ And I laugh exceedingly when I
hear these prayers, for this fear is even childish. For every day and in
every thing, so to speak, do we stand in need of one another. So that
these are the words of an unthinking and puffed up spirit, and that doth
not clearly discern the nature of things. Seest thou not that all of us
are in need one of another? The soldier of the artisan, the artisan of
the merchant, the merchant of the husbandman, the slave of the free man,
the master of the slave, the poor man of the rich, the rich man of the
poor, he that worketh not of him that giveth alms, he that bestoweth of
him that receiveth. For he that receiveth alms supplieth a very great
want, a want greater than any. For if there were no poor, the greater
part of our salvation would be overthrown, in that we should not have
where to bestow our wealth. So that even the poor man who appears to be
more useless than any is the most useful of any. But if to be in need of
another is disgraceful, it remains to die; for it is not possible for a
man to live who is afraid of this. ‘But,’ saith one, ‘I cannot bear
blows arched \[in scorn.\]’ Why dost thou in accusing another of
arrogance, disgrace thyself by this accusation? for to be unable to
endure the inflation of a proud soul is arrogant. And why fearest thou
these things, and tremblest at these things, and on account of these
things which are worthy of no account, dreadest poverty also? For if
thou be rich, thou <span id="page_362">p. 362</span> <span
id="v.xvii-Page_362"></span>wilt stand in need of more, yea of more and
meaner. For just in proportion to thy wealth dost thou subject thyself
to this curse. So ignorant art thou of what thou prayest when thou
askest for wealth in order to be in need of no man; just as if one
having come to a sea, where there is need both of sailors and a ship and
endless stores of outfit, should pray that he might be in need of
nothing at all. For if thou art desirous of being exceedingly
independent of every one, pray for poverty; and \[then\] if thou art
dependent on any, thou wilt be so only for bread and raiment; but in the
other case thou wilt have need of others, both for lands, and for
houses, and for imposts, and for wages, and for rank, and for safety,
and for honor, and for magistrates, and those subject to them, both
those in the city and those in the country, and for merchants, and for
shopkeepers. Do you see that those words are words of extreme
carelessness? For, in a word, if to be in need one of another appears to
thee a dreadful thing, \[know that\] it is impossible altogether to
escape it; but if thou wilt avoid the tumult, (for thou mayest take
refuge in the waveless haven of poverty,) cut off the great tumult of
thy affairs, and deem it not disgraceful to be in need of another; for
this is the doing of God’s unspeakable wisdom. For if we stand in need
one of another, yet even the compulsion of this need draweth us not
together unto love; had we been independent, should we not have been
untamed wild beasts? Perforce and of compulsion God hath subjected us
one to another, and every day we are in collision <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) one with another. And had He removed
this curb, who is there who would readily have longed after his
neighbor’s love? Let us then neither deem this to be disgraceful, nor
pray against it and say, ‘Grant us not to stand in need of any one;’ but
let us pray and say, ‘Suffer us not, when we are in need, to refuse
those who are able to help us.’ It is not the standing in need of
others, but seizing the things of others, that is grievous. But now we
have never prayed in respect to that nor said, ‘Grant me not to covet
other men’s goods;’ but to stand in need, this we think a fit subject of
deprecation <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) . Yet Paul stood in
need many times, and was not ashamed; nay, even prided himself upon it,
and praised those that had ministered to him, saying, “For ye sent once
and again to my need;” ([Philip. iv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016)<span id="v.xvii-p43.3"></span>..md)
and again, “I robbed other Churches, taking wages of them that I might
minister unto you.” ([2 Cor. xi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008)<span id="v.xvii-p43.4"></span>..md) It
is no mark therefore of a generous temper, but of weakness and of a low
minded and senseless spirit, to be ashamed of this. For it is even God’s
decree that we should stand in need one of another. Push not therefore
thy philosophy beyond the mean. ‘But,’ saith one, ‘I cannot bear a man
that is entreated often and complieth not.’ And how shall God bear thee
who art entreated by Him, and yet obeyest not; and entreated too in
things that advantage thee?  “For we are ambassadors on behalf of
Christ,” ([2 Cor. v. 20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.xvii-p43.5"></span>.) saith he, “as though God were entreating by
us; be ye reconciled unto God.” ‘And yet, I am His servant,’ saith he.
And what of that? For when thou, the servant, art drunken, whilst He,
the Master, is hungry and hath not even necessary food, how shall thy
name of servant stand thee in stead? Nay, this itself will even the more
weigh thee down, when thou indeed abidest in a three-storied dwelling
whilst He owns not even a decent shelter; when thou \[liest\] upon soft
couches whilst He hath not even a pillow. ‘But,’ saith one, ‘I have
given.’ But thou oughtest not to leave off so doing. For then only wilt
thou have an excuse, when thou hast not what \[to give\], when thou
possessest nothing; but so long as thou hast, (though thou have given to
ten thousand,) and there be others hungering, there is no excuse for
thee. But when thou both shuttest up corn and raisest the price, and
devisest other unusual tricks of traffic; what hope of salvation shalt
thou have henceforth? Thou hast been bidden to give freely to the
hungry, but thou dost not give at a suitable price even. He emptied
Himself of so great glory for thy sake, but thou dost not count Him
deserving even of a loaf; but thy dog is fed to fulness whilst Christ
wastes with hunger; and thy servant bursteth with surfeiting whilst thy
Lord and his is in want of necessary food. And how are these the deeds
of friends? “Be reconciled unto God,” ([2 Cor. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)<span id="v.xvii-p43.6"></span>..md)
for these are \[the deeds\] of enemies and such as are in hostility.

<span id="v.xvii-p44"></span>\[4.\] Let us then think with shame on the
great benefits we have already received, the great benefits we are yet
to receive. And if a poor man come to us and beg, let us receive him
with much good will, comforting, raising him up with \[our\] words, that
we ourselves also may meet with the like, both from God and from men.
“For whatsoever ye would that they should do unto you, do ye also unto
them.” ([Matt. vii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.xvii-p44.1"></span>.) Nothing burdensome, nothing offensive, doth
this law contain. ‘What thou wouldest receive, that do,’ it saith. The
return is equal. And it said not, ‘what thou wouldest not receive, that
do not,’ but what is more. For that indeed is an abstinence from evil
things, but this is a doing of good things, in which the other is
involved. Also He said not ‘that do ye also wish, but do, to them.’ And
what is the advantage? “This is the Law and <span id="page_363">p.
363</span> <span id="v.xvii-Page_363"></span>the Prophets.” Wouldest
thou have mercy shown thee? Then show mercy. Wouldest thou obtain
forgiveness? Then grant it. Wouldest thou not be evil spoken of? Then
speak not evil. Longest thou to receive praise? Then bestow it. Wouldest
thou not be wronged? Then do not thou plunder. Seest thou how He shows
that virtue is natural, and that we need no external laws nor teachers?
For in the things we wish to receive, or not to receive from our
neighbors, we legislate unto ourselves. So that if thou wouldest not
receive a thing, yet doest it, or if thou wouldest receive it, yet doest
it not, thou art become self-condemned and art henceforth without any
excuse, on the ground of ignorance and of not knowing what ought to be
done. Wherefore, I beseech you, having set up this law in ourselves for
ourselves, and reading this that is written so clearly and succinctly,
let us become such to our neighbors, as we would have them be to
ourselves; that may we both enjoy present immunity <span
id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) , and obtain the future good things,
though the grace and love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, power,
honor, now and for ever, and world without end. Amen.
