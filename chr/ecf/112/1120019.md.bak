<span id="iv.xvi-p2"></span><span id="iv.xvi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xvi-p2.2"></span>[1 Cor.
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xvi-p3"></span>It is actually reported that there is
fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even named among
the Gentiles, that one of you hath his father’s wife. And ye are puffed
up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be
taken away from among you.

<span id="iv.xvi-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iv.xvi-p4.1"></span>When</span> he was discoursing about their
divisions, he did not indeed at once address them vehemently, but more
gently at first; and afterwards, he ended in accusation, saying thus,
([1 Cor. 1.11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p4.2"></span>.) “For it hath been signified unto me
concerning you, my brethren, by them which are of the household of
Chloe, that there are contentions among you.” But in this place, not so;
but he lays about him immediately and makes the reproach of the
accusation as general as possible. For he said not, “Why did such an one
commit fornication?” but, “It is reported that there is fornication
among you;” that they might as persons altogether aloof from his charge
take it easily; but might be filled with such anxiety as was natural
when the whole body was wounded, and the Church had incurred reproach.
“For no one,” saith he, “will state it thus, ‘such an one hath committed
fornication,’ but, ‘in the Church of Corinthians that sin hath been
committed.’”

<span id="iv.xvi-p5"></span>And he said not, “Fornication is
perpetrated,” but, “Is reported,—such as is not even named among the
Gentiles.” For so continually he makes the Gentiles a topic of reproach
to the believers. Thus writing to the Thessalonians, he said, ([1 Thess.
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.xvi-p5.1"></span>,
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xvi-p5.2"></span>καὶ τιμῆ</span> om.
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.xvi-p5.3"></span> τὰ λοιπὰ</span>
inserted.) “Let every one possess himself of his own vessel in
sanctification, not in the passion of lust, even as the rest of the
Gentiles.” And to the Colossians and Ephesians, ([Eph.
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md), [Col.
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#007)<span id="iv.xvi-p5.4"></span>..md)
“That you should no longer walk, as the other Gentiles walk.” Now if
their committing the same sins was unpardonable, when they even outdid
the Gentiles, what place can we find for them? tell me: “inasmuch as
among the Gentiles,” so he speaks, “not only they dare no such thing,
but they do not even give it a name. Do you see to what point he
aggravated his charge? For when they are convicted of inventing such
modes of uncleanness as the unbelievers, so far from venturing on them,
do not even know of, the sin must be exceeding great, beyond all words.
And the clause, “among you,” is spoken also emphatically; that is,
“Among you, the faithful, who have been favored with so high mysteries,
the partakers of secrets, the guests invited to heaven.” Dost thou mark
with what indignant feeling his works overflow? with what anger against
all? For had it not been for the great wrath of which he was full, had
he not been setting himself against them all, he would have spoken
thus:  “Having heard that such and such a person hath committed
fornication, I charge you to punish him.” But as it is he doth not so;
he rather challenges all at once. And indeed, if they had written first,
this is what he probably would have said. Since however so far from
writing, they had even thrown the fault into the shade, on this account
he orders his discourse more vehemently.

<span id="iv.xvi-p6"></span>\[2.\] “That one of you should have his
father’s wife.” Wherefore said he not, “That he should abuse his
father’s wife?” The extreme foulness of the deed caused him to shrink.
He hurries by it accordingly, with a sort of scrupulousness as though it
had been explicitly mentioned before. And hereby again he aggravates the
charge, implying that such things are ventured on among them as even to
speak plainly of was intolerable for Paul. Wherefore also, as he goes
on, he uses the same mode of speech, saying, “Him who hath so done this
thing:” and is again ashamed and blushes to speak out; which also we are
wont to do in regard of matters extremely disgraceful. And he said not,
“his step-mother,” but, “his father’s wife;” so as to strike much more
severely. For when the mere terms are sufficient to convey the charge,
he proceeds with them simply, adding nothing.

<span id="iv.xvi-p7"></span>And “tell me not,” saith he, “that the
fornicator is but one: the charge hath become common to all.” Wherefore
at once he added, “and ye are puffed up:” he said not, “with the sin;”
for this would imply want of all reason:  but with the doctrine you have
heard from that person <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) . This
however he set not <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="iv.xvi-Page_84"></span>down himself, but left it undetermined, that
he might inflict a heavier blow.

<span id="iv.xvi-p9"></span>And mark the good sense of Paul. Having
first overthrown the wisdom from without, and signified that it is
nothing by itself although no sin were associated with it; then and not
till then he discourses about the sin also. For if by way of comparison
with the fornicator who perhaps was some wise one, he had maintained the
greatness of his own spiritual gift; he had done no great thing: but
even when unattended with sin to take down the heathen wisdom and
demonstrate it to be nothing, this was indicating its extreme
worthlessness indeed. Wherefore first, as I said, having made the
comparison, he afterwards mentions the man’s sin also.

<span id="iv.xvi-p10"></span>And with him indeed he condescends not to
debate, and thereby signifies the exceeding greatness of his dishonor.
But to the others he saith, “You ought to weep and wail, and cover your
faces, but now ye do the contrary.” And this is the force of the next
clause, “And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p11"></span>“And why are we to weep?” some might say.
Because the reproach hath made its way even unto the whole body of your
Church. “And what good are we to get by our weeping?” “That such an one
should be taken away from you.” Not even here doth he mention his name;
rather, I should say, not any where; which in all monstrous things is
our usual way.

<span id="iv.xvi-p12"></span>And he said not, “Ye have not rather cast
him out,” but, as in the case of any disease or pestilence, “there is
need of mourning,” saith he, “and of intense supplication, ‘that he may
be taken away.’ And you should have used prayer for this, and left
nothing undone that he should be cut off.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p13"></span>Nor yet doth he accuse them for not having
given him information, but for not having mourned so that the man should
be taken away; implying that even without their Teacher this ought to
have been done, because of the notoriety of the offence.

<span id="iv.xvi-p14"></span>\[3.\] [1 Cor.
v.3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.xvi-p14.1"></span>.
“For I verily being absent in body, but present in spirit.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p15"></span>Mark his energy. He suffers them not even
to wait for his presence, nor to receive him first and then pass the
sentence of binding: but as if on the point of expelling some contagion
before that it have spread itself into the rest of the body, he hastens
to restrain it. And therefore he subjoins the clause, “I have judged
already, as though I were present.” These things moreover he said, not
only to urge them unto the declaration of their sentence and to give
them no opportunity of contriving something else, but also to frighten
them, as one who knew what was to be done and determined there. For this
is the meaning of being “present in spirit:” as Elisha was present with
Gehazi, and said, “Went not my heart with thee? ([2 Kings v.
26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026)<span id="iv.xvi-p15.1"></span>..md)
Wonderful!  How great is the power of the gift, in that it makes all to
be together and as one; and qualifies them to know the things which are
far off. “I have judged already as though I were present.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p16"></span>He permits them not to have any other
device. “Now I have uttered my decision as if I were present: let there
be no delays and puttings off: for nothing else must be done.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p17"></span>Then lest he should be thought too
authoritative and his speech sound rather self-willed, mark how he makes
them also partners in the sentence. For having said, “I have judged,” he
adds, “concerning him that hath so wrought this thing, in the Name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with
the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an one unto Satan.

<span id="iv.xvi-p18"></span>Now what means, “In the Name of our Lord
Jesus Christ?” “According to God;” “not possessed with any human
prejudice.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p19"></span>Some, however, read thus, “Him that hath so
wrought this thing in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,” and putting a
stop there or a break, then subjoin what follows, saying, “When you are
gathered together and my spirit to deliver such an one unto Satan:” and
they assert that the sense of this reading is as follows, “Him that hath
done this thing in the Name of Christ,” saith St. Paul, “deliver ye unto
Satan;” that is, “him that hath done insult unto the Name of Christ, him
that, after he had become a believer and was called after that
appellation, hath dared to do such things, deliver ye unto Satan.” But
to me the former exposition (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xvi-p19.1"></span>ἐκδοσις</span>. It seems to mean
“enunciation.”) appears the truer.

<span id="iv.xvi-p20"></span>What then is this? “When ye are gathered
together in the Name of the Lord.” That is; His Name, in whose behalf ye
have met, collecting you together.

<span id="iv.xvi-p21"></span>“And my spirit.” Again he sets himself at
their head in order that when they should pass sentence, they might no
otherwise cut off the offender than as if he were present; and that no
one might dare to judge him pardonable, knowing that Paul would be aware
of the proceedings.

<span id="iv.xvi-p22"></span>\[4.\] Then making it yet more awful, he
saith, “with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ;” that is, either that
Christ is able to give you such grace as that you should have power to
deliver him to the devil; or that He is <span id="page_85">p. 85</span>
<span id="iv.xvi-Page_85"></span>Himself together with you passing that
sentence against him.

<span id="iv.xvi-p23"></span>And he said not, “Give up” such an one to
Satan, but “deliver;” opening unto him the doors of repentance, and
delivering up such an one as it were to a schoolmaster. And again it is,
“such an one:” he no where can endure to make mention of his name.

<span id="iv.xvi-p24"></span>“For the destruction of the flesh.” As was
done in the case of the blessed Job, but not upon the same ground. For
in that case it was for brighter crowns, but here for loosing of sins;
that he might scourge him with a grievous sore or some other disease.
True it is that elsewhere he saith, “Of the Lord are we judged, ([1 Cor.
xi. 32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p24.1"></span>.) when we suffer these things.” But here,
desirous of making them feel it more severely, he “delivereth up unto
Satan.” And so this too which God had determined ensued, that the man’s
flesh was chastised. For because inordinate eating and carnal
luxuriousness are the parents of desires, it is the flesh which he
chastises.

<span id="iv.xvi-p25"></span>“That the spirit may be saved in the day of
the Lord Jesus;” that is the soul. Not as though this were saved alone,
but because it was a settled point that if that were saved, without all
controversy the body too would partake in its salvation. For as it
became mortal because of the soul’s sinning: so if this do
righteousness, that also on the other hand shall enjoy great glory.

<span id="iv.xvi-p26"></span>But some maintain, that “the Spirit” is the
Gracious Gift which is extinguished when we sin. “In order then that
this may not happen,” saith he, “let him be punished; that thereby
becoming better, he may draw down to himself God’s grace, and be found
having it safe in that day.” So that all comes as from one exercising a
nurse’s or a physician’s office, not merely scourging nor punishing
rashly and at random. For the gain is greater than the punishment: one
being but for a season, the other everlasting.

<span id="iv.xvi-p27"></span>And he said not simply, “That the spirit
may be saved,” but “in that day.” Well and seasonably doth he remind
them of that day in order that both they might more readily apply
themselves to the cure, and that the person censured might the rather
receive his words, not as it were of anger, but as the forethought of an
anxious father. For this cause also he said, “unto the destruction of
the flesh:” proceeding to lay down regulations for the devil and not
suffering him to go a step too far. As in the instance of Job, God said,
([Job ii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p27.1"></span>.) “But touch not his life.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p28"></span>\[5.\] Then, having ended his sentence, and
spoken it in brief without dwelling on it, he brings in again a rebuke,
directing himself against them;

<span id="iv.xvi-p29"></span>[1 Cor.
5.6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.xvi-p29.1"></span>.
“Your glorying is not good:” signifying that it was they up to the
present time who had hindered him from repenting, by taking pride in
him. Next he shews that he is taking this step in order to spare not
that person only, but also those to whom he writes. To which effect he
adds,

<span id="iv.xvi-p30"></span>“Know ye not, that a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump?” “For,” saith he, “though the offence be his,
yet if neglected it hath power to waste the rest of the body of the
Church also. For when the first transgressor escapes punishment,
speedily will others also commit the same faults.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p31"></span> In these words he indicates moreover that
their struggle and their danger is for the whole Church, not for any one
person. For which purpose he needeth also the similitude of the leaven.
For “as that,” saith he, “though it be but little, transforms unto its
own nature the whole lump; so also this man, if he be let go unpunished
and this sin turn out unavenged, will corrupt likewise all the rest.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p32"></span>[1 Cor.
5.7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.xvi-p32.1"></span>.
“Purge out the old leaven,” that is, this evil one. Not that he speaketh
concerning this one only; rather he glances at others with him. For,
“the old leaven” is not fornication only, but also sin of every kind.
And he said not, “purge,” but “purge out;” “cleanse with accuracy so
that there be not so much as a remnant nor a shadow of that sort.” In
saying then, “purge out,” he signifies that there was still iniquity
among them. But in saying, “that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are
unleavened,” he affirms and declares that not over very many was the
wickedness prevailing. But though he saith, “as ye are unleavened,” he
means it not as a fact that all were clean, but as to what sort of
people you ought to be.

<span id="iv.xvi-p33"></span>\[6.\] “For our Passover also hath been
sacrificed for us, even Christ; wherefore let us keep the feast: not
with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with
the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” So also Christ called His
doctrine Leaven. And further he himself dwells upon the metaphor,
reminding them of an ancient history, and of the Passover and unleavened
bread, and of their blessings both then and now, and their punishments
and their plagues.

<span id="iv.xvi-p34"></span> It is festival, therefore, the whole time
in which we live. For though he said, “Let us keep the feast,” not with
a view to the presence of the Passover or of Pentecost did he say it;
but as pointing out that the whole of time is a festival unto
Christians, because of the excellency of the good things which have been
given. For what hath not come to pass that is good?  The Son of God was
made man for thee; He freed thee from death; and called thee to a
kingdom. Thou therefore who hast obtained and art still obtaining such
things, how can it <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="iv.xvi-Page_86"></span>be less than thy duty to “keep the feast” all
thy life? Let no one then be downcast about poverty, and disease, and
craft of enemies. For it is a festival, even the whole of our time.
Wherefore saith Paul, ([Philip. iv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004)<span id="iv.xvi-p34.1"></span>..md)
“Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, Rejoice.” Upon the festival
days no one puts on filthy garments. Neither then let us do so. For a
marriage hath been made, a spiritual marriage. For, “the kingdom of
Heaven,” saith He, “is likened unto a certain king which would make (St.
[Matt. xxii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p34.2"></span>. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.xvi-p34.3"></span> ἠθέλησε ποιῆσαι</span>, rec. text <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.xvi-p34.4"></span> ἐποίησε</span>.) a
marriage feast for his son.” Now where it is a king making a marriage,
and a marriage for his son, what can be greater than this feast?  Let no
one then enter in clad in rags. Not about garments is our discourse but
about unclean actions. For if where all wore bright apparel one alone,
being found at the marriage in filthy garments, was cast out with
dishonor, consider how great strictness and purity the entrance into
that marriage feast requires.

<span id="iv.xvi-p35"></span>\[7.\] However, not on this account only
does he remind them of the “unleavened bread,” but also to point out the
affinity of the Old Testament with the New; and to point out also that
it was impossible, after the “unleavened bread,” again to enter into
Egypt; but if any one chose to return, he would suffer the same things
as did they. For those things were a shadow of these; however obstinate
the Jew may be. Wherefore shouldest thou enquire of him, he will speak,
no great thing, rather it is great which he will speak of, but nothing
like what we speak of: because he knows not the truth. For he for his
part will say, “the Egyptians who detained us were so changed by the
Almighty that they themselves urged and drave us out, who before held us
forcibly; they did not suffer us so much as to leaven our dough.” But if
a man asketh me, he shall hear not of Egypt nor of Pharaoh; but of our
deliverance from the deceit of demons and the darkness of the devil: not
of Moses but of the Son of God; not of a Red Sea but of a Baptism
overflowing with ten thousand blessings, where the “old man” is drowned.

<span id="iv.xvi-p36"></span>Again, shouldest thou ask the Jew why he
expels all leaven from all his borders; here he will even be silent and
will not so much as state any reason. And this is because, although some
indeed of the circumstances were both types of things to come, and also
due to things then happening; yet others were not so, that the Jews
might not deal deceitfully; that they might not abide in the shadow. For
tell me, what is the meaning of the Lamb’s being a “Male,” and
“Unblemished,” and a “year old,” and of, “a bone shall not be broken?”
and what means the command to call the neighbors also, ([Exod. xii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#004)<span id="iv.xvi-p36.1"></span>..md) and
that it should be eaten “standing” and “in the evening;” or the
fortifying the house with blood? He will have nothing else to say but
over and over all about Egypt. But I can tell you the meaning both of
the Blood, and of the Evening, and the Eating all together, and of the
rule that all should be standing.

<span id="iv.xvi-p37"></span>\[8.\] But first let us explain why the
leaven is cast out of all their borders. What then is the hidden
meaning? The believer must be freed from all iniquity. For as among them
he perishes with whomsoever is found old leaven, so also with us
wheresoever is found iniquity: since of course the punishment being so
great in that which is a shadow, in our case it cannot choose but be
much greater. For if they so carefully clear their houses of
leaven <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) , and pry into mouse-holes;
much more ought we to search through the soul so as to cast out every
unclean thought.

<span id="iv.xvi-p39"></span>This however was done by them of late <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) ; but now no longer. For every where
there is leaven, where a Jew is found. For it is in the midst of cities
that the feast of unleavened bread is kept: a thing which is now rather
a game at play than a law. For since the Truth is come, the Types have
no longer any place.

<span id="iv.xvi-p41"></span>So that by means of this example also he
mightily drives the fornicator out of the Church. For, saith he, so far
from his presence profiting, he even doth harm, injuring the common
estate of the body. For one knows not whence is the evil savor while the
corrupt part is concealed, and so one imputes it to the whole. Wherefore
he urges upon them strongly to “purge out the leaven, that ye may be,”
saith he, “a new lump, even as ye are unleavened.”

<span id="iv.xvi-p42"></span>“For our Passover hath been sacrificed for
us even Christ.” He said not, hath died, but more in point to the
subject in hand, “hath been sacrificed.” Seek not then unleavened bread
of this kind, since neither hast thou a lamb of the same kind. Seek not
leaven of this description, seeing that thine unleavened bread is not
such as this.

<span id="iv.xvi-p43"></span>\[9.\] Thus, in the case of material
leaven, <span id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span
id="iv.xvi-Page_87"></span>the unleavened might become leavened, but
never the reverse; whereas here there is a chance of the direct contrary
occuring. This however he has not plainly declared:  and observe his
good sense. In the former Epistle he gives the fornicator no hope of
return, but orders that his whole life should be spent in repentance,
lest he should make him less energetic through the promise. For he said
not, “Deliver him up to Satan,” that having repented he might be
commended again unto the Church. But what saith he? “That he may be
saved in the last day.” For he conducts him on unto that time in order
to make him full of anxiety. And what favors he intended him after the
repentance, he reveals not, imitating his own Master. For as God saith,
([Jonah iii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p43.1"></span>. lxx: rec. text, “forty days.”) “Yet three
days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,” and added not, “but if she
repent she shall be saved:” so also he did not say here, “But if he
repent worthily, we will ‘confirm our love towards him.’” ([2 Cor. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#008)<span id="iv.xvi-p43.2"></span>..md).
But he waits for him to do the work that so he may then receive the
favor. For if he had said this at the beginning he might have set him
free from the fear. Wherefore he not only does not so, but by the
instance of leaven allows him not even a hope of return, but reserves
him unto that day: “Purge out (so he says) the old leaven;” and, “let us
not keep the feast with old leaven.” But as soon as he had repented, he
brought him in again with all earnestness.

<span id="iv.xvi-p44"></span>\[10.\] But why does he call it “old?”
Either because our former life was of this sort, or because that which
is old is “ready to vanish away,” ([Heb. viii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#013)<span id="iv.xvi-p44.1"></span>..md)
and is unsavory and foul; which is the nature of sin. For He neither
simply finds fault with the old, nor simply praises the new, but with
reference to the subject matter. And thus elsewhere He saith,
([Ecclesiasticus 9.15](../../../bib/apo/sir009.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p44.2"></span>.) “New wine is as a new friend: but if it
become old, then with pleasure shalt thou drink it:” in the case of
friendship bestowing his praise rather upon the old than the new. And
again, “The Ancient of days sat,” ([Dan. vii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009)<span id="iv.xvi-p44.3"></span>..md)
here again, taking the term “ancient” as among those laudatory
expressions which confer highest glory. Elsewhere the Scripture takes
the term “old” in the sense of blame; for seeing that the things are of
various aspect as being composed of many parts, it uses the same words
both in a good and an evil import, not according to the same shade of
meaning. Of which you may see an instance in the blame cast elsewhere on
the old: ([Ps. xvii. 46](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#046.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p44.4"></span>. ap. LXX.) “They waxed old, and they halted
from their paths.” And again, ([Ps. vi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.xvi-p44.5"></span>. ap.
LXX.) “I have become old in the midst of all mine enemies.” And again,
(<span id="iv.xvi-p44.6"></span>Dan. xiii. 52. Hist. Susan.) “O thou
that art become old in evil days.” So also the “Leaven” is often taken
for the kingdom of Heaven, although here found fault with. But in that
place it is used with one aspect, and in this with another.

<span id="iv.xvi-p45"></span>\[11.\] But I have a strong conviction that
the saying about the leaven refers also to the priests who suffer a vast
deal of the old leaven to be within, not purging out from their borders,
that is, out of the Church, the covetous, the extortioners, and
whatsoever would exclude from the kingdom of Heaven. For surely
covetousness is an “old leaven;” and whenever it lights and into
whatsoever house it enters, makes it unclean: and though you may gain
but little by your injustice, it leavens the whole of your substance.
Wherefore not seldom the dishonest gain being little, hath cast out the
stock honestly laid up however abundant. For nothing is more rotten than
covetousness. You may fasten up that man’s closet with key, and door,
and bolt: you do all in vain, whilst you shut up within covetousness,
the worst of robbers, and able to carry off all.

<span id="iv.xvi-p46"></span>“But what,” say you, “if there are many
covetous who do not experience this?” In the first place, they will
experience it, though their experience come not immediately. And should
they now escape, then do thou fear it the more: for they are reserved
for greater punishment. Add to this, that in the event of themselves
escaping, yet those who inherit their wealth will have the same to
endure. “But how can this be just,” you will say? It is quite just. For
he that has succeeded to an inheritance; full of injustice, though he
have committed no rapine himself, detains nevertheless the property of
others; and is perfectly aware of this; and it is fair he should suffer
for it. For if this or that person had robbed and you received a thing,
and then the owner came and demanded it back; would it avail you in
defence to say that you had not seized it?  By no means. For what would
be your plea when accused! tell me. That it was another who seized it?
Well: but you are keeping possession. That it was he who robbed? But you
are enjoying it. Why these rules even the laws of the heathen recognise,
which acquitting those who have seized and stolen, bid you demand
satisfaction from those persons in whose possession you happen to find
your things all laid up.

<span id="iv.xvi-p47"></span>If then you know who are the injured,
restore and do what Zacchæus did, with much increase. But if you know
not, I offer you another way yet; I do not preclude you from the remedy.
Distribute all these things to the poor: and thus you will mitigate the
evil.

<span id="iv.xvi-p48"></span>But if some have transmitted these things
even to children and descendants, still in retribution they have
suffered other disasters.

<span id="iv.xvi-p49"></span><span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span
id="iv.xvi-Page_88"></span>\[12.\] And why speak I of things in this
present life? In that day at any rate will none of these things be said,
when both appear naked, both the spoiled and the spoilers. Or rather not
alike naked. Of riches indeed both will be equally stripped; but the one
will be full of the charges to which they gave occasion. What then shall
we do on that day, when before the dread tribunal he that hath been evil
entreated and lost his all is brought forward into the midst, and you
have no one to speak a word for you? What will you say to the Judge? Now
indeed you may be able even to corrupt the judgment, being but of men;
but in that court and at that time, it will be no longer so: no, nor yet
now will you be able. For even at this moment that tribunal is present:
since God both seeth our doings and is near unto the injured, though not
invoked: it being certain that whoever suffers wrong, however in himself
unworthy to obtain any redress, yet nevertheless seeing that what is
done pleases not God, he hath most assuredly one to avenge him.

<span id="iv.xvi-p50"></span>“How then,” you will say, “is such an one
well off, who is wicked?” Nay, it will not be so unto the end. Hear what
saith the Prophet; ([Ps. 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002)<span id="iv.xvi-p50.1"></span>..md)
“Fret not thyself because of the evil doers, because as grass they shall
quickly wither away.” For where, tell me, where is he who wrought
rapine, after his departure hence? Where are his bright hopes!  Where
his august name? Are they not all passed and gone? Is it not a dream and
a shadow, all that was his? And this you must expect in the case of
every such person, both in his own person while living, and in that of
him who shall come after him. But not such is the state of the saints,
nor will it be possible for you to say the same things in their case
also, that it is shadow and a dream and a tale, what belongs to them.

<span id="iv.xvi-p51"></span>\[13.\] And if you please, he who spake
these things, the tent-maker, the Cilician, the man whose very parentage
is unknown, let him be the example we produce. You will say, “How is it
possible to become such as he was?” Do you then thoroughly desire it?
Are you thoroughly anxious to become such? “Yes,” you will say. Well
then, go the same way as he went and they that were with him. Now what
way went he? One saith, ([2 Cor. xi.
27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027)<span id="iv.xvi-p51.1"></span>..md)
“In hunger, and thirst, and nakedness.” Another, ([Acts iii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006)<span id="iv.xvi-p51.2"></span>..md)
“Silver and gold I have none.” Thus they “had nothing and yet possessed
all things.” ([2 Cor. vi. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p51.3"></span>.) What can be nobler than this saying? what
more blessed or more abundant in riches?  Others indeed pride themselves
on the contrary things, saying, “I have this or that number of talents
of gold, and acres of land without end, and houses, and slaves;” but
this man on his being naked of all things; and he shrinks not from
poverty, (which is the feeling of the unwise,) nor hides his face, but
he even wears it as an ornament.

<span id="iv.xvi-p52"></span>Where now be the rich men, they who count
up their interest simple and compound, they who take from all men and
are never satisfied? Have ye heard the voice of Peter, that voice which
sets forth poverty as the mother of wealth? That voice which has
nothing, yet is wealthier than those who wear diadems?  For this is that
voice, which having nothing, raised the dead, and set upright the lame,
and drove away devils, and bestowed such gracious gifts, as those who
are clad in the purple robe and lead the mighty and terrible legions
never were able to bestow. This is the voice of those who are now
removed into heaven, of those who have attained unto that height.

<span id="iv.xvi-p53"></span>\[14.\] Thus it is possible that he who
hath nothing may possess all men’s goods. Thus may he who possesses
nothing acquire the goods of all: whereas, were we to get all men’s
goods, we are bereft of all. Perhaps this saying seems to be a paradox;
but it is not. “But,” you will say, “how does he who hath nothing
possess all men’s goods? Doth he not have much more who hath what
belongs to all?” By no means: but the contrary. For he who hath nothing
commands all, even as they did. And throughout the world all houses were
open to them, and they who offered them took their coming as a favor,
and they came to them as to friends and kindred.  For so they came to
the woman who was a seller of purple, ([Acts xvi.
14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014)<span id="iv.xvi-p53.1"></span>..md)
and she like a servant set before them what she had. And to the keeper
of the prison; and he opened to them all his house. And to innumerable
others. Thus they had all things and had nothing: for ([Acts iv.
32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032)<span id="iv.xvi-p53.2"></span>..md)
“they said that none of the things which they possessed was their own;”
therefore all things were theirs. For he that considers all things to be
common, will not only use his own, but also the things of others as if
they belonged to him. But he that parts things off and sets himself as
master over his own only, will not be master even of these. And this is
plain from an example. He who possesses nothing at all, neither house,
nor table, nor garment to spare, but for God’s sake is bereft of all,
uses the things which are in common as his own; and he shall receive
from all whatsoever he may desire, and thus he that hath nothing
possesses the things of all. But he that hath some things, will not be
master even of these. For first, no one will give to him that hath
possessions; and, secondly, his property shall belong to robbers and
thieves and informers and changing events and be any body’s rather than
his. Paul, for instance, went up and down throughout all the world,
<span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="iv.xvi-Page_89"></span>carrying nothing with him, though he went
neither unto friends nor kindred. Nay, at first he was a common enemy to
all: but nevertheless he had all men’s goods after he had made good his
entrance. But Ananias and Sapphira, hastening to gain a little more than
their own, lost all together with life itself. Withdraw then from thine
own, that thou mayest use others’ goods as thine own.

<span id="iv.xvi-p54"></span>\[15.\] But I must stop: I know not how I
have been carried into such a transport in speaking such words as these
unto men who think it a great thing to impart but ever so little of
their own. Wherefore let these my words have been spoken to the perfect.
But to the more imperfect, this is what we may say, Give of what you
have unto the needy. Increase your substance. For, saith He, ([Prov.
xix. 17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.xvi-p54.1"></span>.) “He that giveth unto the poor, lendeth unto
God.” But if you are in a hurry and wait not for the time of recompense,
think of those who lend money to men: for not even these desire to get
their interest immediately; but they are anxious that the principal
should remain a good long while in the hands of the borrower, provided
only the repayment be secure and they have no mistrust of the borrower.
Let this be done then in the present case also. Leave them with God that
He may pay thee thy wages manifold. Seek not to have the whole here; for
if you recover it all here, how will you receive it back there? And it
is on this account that God stores them up there, inasmuch as this
present life is full of decay. But He gives even here also; for, “Seek
ye,” saith He, “the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be
added unto you.” (St. [Matt. vi.
33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033)<span id="iv.xvi-p54.2"></span>..md)
Well then, let us look towards the kingdom, and not be in a hurry for
the repayment of the whole, lest we diminish our recompense. But let us
wait for the fit season. For the interest in these cases is not of that
kind, but is such as is meet to be given to God. This then having
collected together in great abundance, so let us depart hence, that we
may obtain both the present and the future blessings; through the grace
and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom unto the Father
and the Holy Spirit be glory, power, honor, now, henceforth, and for
evermore. Amen.

<span id="iv.xvi-p8"></span> S. Aug. *cont. Parm*. iii. 5. gives their
“glorying” a different turn; saying, (with especial reference to [1 Cor.
5.6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006)<span id="iv.xvi-p8.1"></span>..md)
“To glory, not for their own sins, but over other men’s sins, as in
comparison with their own innocence, may seem but ‘a little leaven;’
while to boast even of one’s iniquities is much leaven: however, this
also ‘leaveneth the whole lump.’” \[Perhaps the phrase refers merely to
their general elation at their good estate, notwithstanding their
toleration of so great an offence. C.\]

<span id="fn_76"></span>[86:77](1120019.htm#fr_76.md) <span
id="iv.xvi-p37.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xvi-p38"></span> Lightfoot, *Works*, i. 953. “‘*Seven days
there shall be no leaven found in your houses*.’ The Jews to meet this
command that was so exceeding strict, and to make sure for its
observance soon enough, ‘did on the fourteenth day, while yet there was
some light, make search for leaven by the light of a candle.’  (*Talm.
in Pesachim*. no. 1.) Thus is the Tradition; in which by the light of
the fourteenth day their glossaries tell us that we must understand the
‘thirteenth day at even, when it began to be duskish and candle-light.’
The rubric of the Passover in the Hebrew and Spanish tongues renders it,
‘At the entrance of the fourteenth day of the month Nisan, they searched
for leaven in all the places where they were wont to use leaven, even in
holes and crannies; and that not by light of the sun and moon, or torch,
but by the light of a wax candle,’…because it is the fittest for
searching holes and corners, and because the Scripture speaketh of
searching Jerusalem with candles.” See [Zeph. i.
12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.xvi-p38.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[86:78](1120019.htm#fr_77.md) <span
id="iv.xvi-p39.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xvi-p40"></span> i.e. (as it should seem) it has now become
impossible for the Jews to keep this command, since they and their false
doctrine are (spiritually) that very leaven, which is to be put away.
Compare St. [Matt. xvi. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md)<span
