<span id="iii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="iii-p3"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iii-p3.1"></span>The</span> British edition of this translation has
a preface in which is given a short “sketch” of Chrysostom’s history. As
a fuller outline has been given in the course of the present
reproduction of the homilies, it is considered advisable to omit this
sketch here. (See Vol. ix. pp. 3–23.) The remainder of the English
editor’s preface is as follows:

<span id="iii-p4"></span>“The history and remains of St. Chrysostom are
in one respect more interesting perhaps to the modern reader, than most
of the monuments of those who are technically called the Fathers. At the
time when he was raised up, and in those parts of the Christian world to
which he was sent, the Patriarchates, namely, of Antioch and
Constantinople, the Church was neither agitated by persecution from
without, nor by any particular doctrinal controversy within, sufficient
to attract his main attention, and connect his name with its history, as
the name of St. Athanasius, e.g., is connected with the Arian, or that
of St. Augustine with the Pelagian, controversy. The labours of St.
Athanasius and St. Basil, and their friends and disciples, had come to a
happy issue at the second Œcumenical Council; the civil power favoured
orthodox doctrine, and upheld Episcopal authority. The Church seemed for
the time free to try the force of her morals and discipline against the
ordinary vices and errors of all ages and all nations. This is one
reason why the Homilies of St. Chrysostom have always been considered as
eminently likely among the relics of Antiquity, to be useful as models
for preaching, and as containing hints for the application of Scripture
to common life, and the consciences of persons around us.

<span id="iii-p5"></span>Another reason undoubtedly is the remarkable
energy and fruitfulness of the writer’s mind, that command of language
and of topics, and above all, that depth of charitable and religious
feeling, which enabled him, to a very remarkable extent, to carry his
hearers along with him, even when the things he recommended were most
distasteful to their natures and prejudices. It is obvious how much of
the expression of this quality must vanish in translation: the elegance
and fluency of his Greek style, the flow of his periods, the quickness
and ingenuity of his turns, all the excellencies to which more
especially his surname was owing, must in the nature of things be
sacrificed, except in case of very rare felicity, on passing into a
modern language. His dramatic manner indeed, which was one of the great
charms of his oratory among the Greeks, and his rapid and ingenious
selection and variation of topics, these may in some measure be
retained, and may serve to give even English readers some faint notion
of the eloquence which produced so powerful effects on the susceptible
people of the East.

<span id="iii-p6"></span>“However, it is not of course as composition
that we desire to call attention to these or any other of the remains of
the Fathers. Nor would this topic have been so expressly adverted to,
but for the two following reasons. First, it is in such particulars as
these, that the parallel mainly subsists, which has more than once been
observed, between St. Chrysostom and our own <span id="page_iv">p.
iv</span> <span id="iii-Page_iv"></span>Bishop Taylor: and it is good
for the Church in general, and encouraging for our own Church in
particular, to notice such providential revivals of ancient graces in
modern times.

<span id="iii-p7"></span>“Again, this profusion of literary talent, and
eloquency and vehemence and skill in moral teaching, is of itself, as
human nature now exists, a matter of much jealousy to considerate
persons, found answerable to the profession implied in their works. And
therefore it was desirable to dwell on it in this instance, for the
purpose of pointing out afterwards how completely his life gave evidence
that he meant and practiced what he taught.

<span id="iii-p8"></span>“The Homilies on the first Epistle to the
Corinthians have ever been considered by learned and devout men as among
the most perfect specimens of his mind and teaching. They are of that
mixed form, between exposition and exhortation, which serves perhaps
better than any other, first, to secure attention, and then to convey to
an attentive hearer the full purport of the holy words as they stand in
the Bible, and to communicate to him the very impression which the
preacher himself had received from the text. Accordingly they come in
not unfitly in this series, by way of specimen of the hortatory Sermons
of the ancients, as St. Cyril’s, of their Catechetical Lectures, and St.
Cyprians, the Pastoral Letters, which were circulated among them.

<span id="iii-p9"></span>“The date of these Homilies is not exactly
known: but it is certain that they were delivered at Antioch, were it
only from Hom. xxi. §. 9. ad fin. Antioch was at that time, in a
temporal sense, a flourishing Church, maintaining 3,000 widows and
virgins, <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) maimed persons, prisoners,
and ministers of the altar; although, St. Chrysostom adds, its income
was but that of one of the lowest class of wealthy individuals. It was
indeed in a state of division, on account of the disputed succession in
the Episcopate between the followers of Paulinus and Meletius since the
year 362: but this separation affected not immediately any point of
doctrine; and was in a way to be gradually worn out, partly by the
labors of St. Chrysostom himself, whose discourse concerning the
Anathema seems to have been occasioned by the too severe way in which
the partisans on both sides allowed themselves to speak of each other.
It may be that he had an eye to this schism in his way of handling those
parts of the Epistles to the Corinthians, which so earnestly deprecate
the spirit of schism and party, and the calling ourselves by human
names.

<span id="iii-p11"></span>“The Text which has been used in this
translation is the Benedictine, corrected however in many places by that
of Savile. The Benedictine Sections are marked in the margin thus, (2.)
For the Translation, the Editors are indebted to the Reverend <span
class="c18"><span id="iii-p11.1"></span>Hubert Kestell Cornish</span>,
M.A., late Fellow of Exeter College, and to the Reverend <span
class="c18"><span id="iii-p11.2"></span>John Medley</span>, M.A., of
Wadham College, Vicar of St. Thomas, in the city of Exeter.”

<span id="iii-p13"></span>

<span id="iii-p14"></span>The Homilies on the Second Epistle were issued
four years later than those on the First, and were preceded by the
following note:

<span id="iii-p15"></span>“The present Volume completes the set of St.
Chrysostom’s Commentaries on the Epistles of St. Paul, with the
exception of that to the Hebrews, the Translation of which is preparing
for the press. The edition of the original by Mr. Field has afforded the
advantage of an improved text, in fact of one as good as we can hope to
see constructed from existing <span class="c18"><span
id="iii-p15.1"></span>mss.</span>

<span id="iii-p16"></span><span id="page_v">p. v</span> <span
id="iii-Page_v"></span>“These Homilies were delivered at Antioch in the
opinion of the Benedictine Editors, though Savile doubted it. The
question depends on the interpretation of a passage near the end of Hom.
xxvi., in which St. Chrysostom speaks of Constantinople, and presently
says ‘here.’ This, it has been rightly argued, he might say in the sense
of “in the place I am speaking of,’ while he was not likely to say, ‘in
Constantinople’ if he were speaking there.

<span id="iii-p17"></span>“For the Translation the Editors are indebted
to the Rev. <span class="c18"><span id="iii-p17.1"></span>J.
Ashworth</span>, M.A., of Brasenose College.”

<span id="iii-p18"></span>S. Clement, 1848.

<span id="iii-p19"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iii-p19.1"></span>C. M. M\[arriott.\]</span>

<span id="iii-p20"></span>This volume of the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers, embraces both volumes of the original London issue, one of
which appeared in 1844, the other in 1848. The author of the latter had,
as appears from his statement above, the advantage of using the
recension of the Greek text which was prepared by the late <span
class="c18"><span id="iii-p20.1"></span>Frederick Field</span>, M.A.,
LL.D., and eminent textual critic whose labors leave nothing to be
desired so far as concerns the materials at his command. The translators
of the First Epistle did not have this advantage. Hence the present
editor has made a diligent comparison throughout their work with Dr.
<span class="c18"><span id="iii-p20.2"></span>Field’s</span> text, and
whenever it was necessary has silently conformed the rendering to that
text, in a few instances omitting a note which made needless or
inappropriate by the change. In both Epistles he has occasionally
amended the translation to gain perspicuity and smoothness. The work of
the English authors has been performed with great care and fidelity, and
is literal almost to a fault, it apparently being their endeavor to
reproduce the form as well as the spirit of the original. This has given
to their pages a stiffness and constraint not altogether agreeable, yet
it is a compensation to the reader to know that he has before him the
precise thought of the great pulpit orator of the Greek Church. The
American Editor’s notes have been enclosed in square brackets and marked
with his initial.

<span id="iii-p21"></span>The English text of the Epistles has been
sedulously conformed to that of the Revised Edition of 1881, except in
cases in which the Greek text used by Chrysostom varied from that
adopted by recent Editors. All peculiarities of Chrysostom’s text have
been faithfully preserved.

<span id="iii-p22"></span>In these days when expository preaching is so
loudly and generally demanded, it cannot but be of use to the rising
ministry to see how this service was performed by the most eloquent and
effective of the Fathers, John of the Golden-Mouth.
