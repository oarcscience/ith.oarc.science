<span id="v.xx-p2"></span><span id="v.xx-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.xx-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor. ix.

<span id="v.xx-p3"></span>*Now He that supplied seed to the sower, both
minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed for sowing and
increase the fruits of your righteousness* <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) .

<span id="v.xx-p5"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.xx-p5.1"></span>Herein</span> one may particularly admire the
wisdom of Paul, that after having exhorted from spiritual considerations
and from temporal, in respect of the recompense also he again does the
very same, making the returns he mentions of either kind. This, (for
instance,) “He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor, his
righteousness abideth for ever,” belongs to a spiritual return; that
again, “multiply your seed for sowing,” to a temporal recompense. Still,
however, he rests not here, but even again passes back to what is
spiritual, placing the two continually side by side; for “increase the
fruits of your righteousness,” is spiritual. This he does, and gives
variety by it to his discourse, tearing up by the roots those their
unmanly and faint-hearted reasonings, and using many arguments to
dissipate their fear of poverty, as also the example which he now
brings. For if even to those that sow the earth God gives, if to those
that feed the body He grants abundance; much more will He to those who
till the soil <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) of heaven, to
those who take care for the soul; for these things He willeth should yet
more enjoy His providing care. However, he does not state this in the
way of inference nor in the manner I have done, but in the form of a
prayer; thus at once making the reference plain, and the rather leading
them on to hope, not only from what \[commonly\] takes place, but also
from his own prayer: for, ‘May He minister,’ saith he, ‘and multiply
your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness.’
Here also again he hints, in an unsuspicious way, at largeness \[in
giving\], for the words, “multiply and increase,” are by way of
indicating this; and at the same time he allows them to seek for nothing
more than necessaries, saying, “bread for food.” For this also is
particularly worthy of admiration in him, (and it is a point he
successfully established <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) even
before,) namely, that in things which be necessary, he allows them to
seek for nothing more than need requires; but in spiritual things
counsels them to get for themselves a large superabundance. Wherefore he
said above also, “that having a sufficiency ye may abound to every good
work:” and here, “He that ministereth bread for food, multiply your seed
for sowing;” that is to say, the spiritual \[seed\]. For he asks not
almsgiving merely, but with largeness. Wherefore also he continually
calls it “seed.” For like as the corn cast into the ground showeth
luxuriant crops, so also many are the handfuls almsgiving produceth of
righteousness, and unspeakable the fruits it showeth. Then having prayed
for great affluence unto them, he shows again in what they ought to
expend it, saying,

<span id="v.xx-p8"></span>[2 Cor.
9.11](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011.md)<span id="v.xx-p8.1"></span>.
“That being enriched in every thing to all liberality, which worketh
through us thanksgiving to God.”

<span id="v.xx-p9"></span>Not that ye may consume it upon things not
fitting, but upon such as bring much thanksgiving to God. For God made
us to have the disposal of great things, and reserving to Himself that
which is less yielded to us that which is greater. For corporeal <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) nourishment is at His sole disposal,
but mental <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md) He permitted to us;
for we have it at our own disposal whether the crops we have to show be
luxuriant. For no need is here of rains and of variety of seasons, but
of the will only, and they run up to heaven itself. And largeness in
giving is what he here calls liberality <span
id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md) . “Which worketh through us
thanksgiving to God.” For neither is that which is done almsgiving
merely, but also the ground of much thanksgiving: yea rather, not of
thanksgiving only, but of many other things besides. And these as he
goes on he mentions, that by showing it to be the cause of many good
works, he may make them thereby the forwarder.

<span id="v.xx-p13"></span>\[2.\] What then are these many good works?
Hear him saying:

<span id="v.xx-p14"></span>[2 Cor.
9.12-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xx-p14.1"></span>.
“For the ministration of this service, not only filleth up the measure
of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through <span
id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span id="v.xx-Page_373"></span>many
thanksgivings unto God; seeing that through the proving <span
id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) of you by this ministration, they
glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the Gospel <span
id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md) , and for the liberality of your
contribution unto them and unto all; while they also with supplication
on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God
in you.”

<span id="v.xx-p17"></span>What he says is this; ‘in the first place ye
not only supply the wants of the saints, but ye are abundant even;’ that
is, ‘ye furnish them with even more than they need: next, through them
ye send up thanksgiving to God, for they glorify Him for the obedience
of your confession.’ For that he may not represent them as giving thanks
on this account solely, (I mean, because they received somewhat,) see
how high-minded he makes them, exactly as he himself says to the
Philippians, “Not that I desire a gift.” ([Philip. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#017)<span id="v.xx-p17.1"></span>..md) ‘To
them too I bear record of the same thing. For they rejoice indeed that
ye supply their wants and alleviate their poverty; but far more, in that
ye are so subjected to the Gospel; whereof this is an evidence, your
contributing so largely.’ For this the Gospel enjoins.

<span id="v.xx-p18"></span>“And for the liberality of your contribution
unto them and unto all.” ‘And on this account,’ he says, ‘they glorify
God that ye are so liberal, not unto them only, but also unto all.’ And
this again is made a praise unto them that they gave thanks even for
that which is bestowed upon others. ‘For,’ saith he, ‘they do
honor <span id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) , not to their own
concerns only, but also to those of others, and this although they are
in the extremest poverty; which is an evidence of their great virtue.
For nothing is so full of envy as the whole race of such as are in
poverty. But they are pure from this passion; being so far from feeling
pained because of the things ye impart to others, that they even rejoice
over it no less than over the things themselves receive.’

<span id="v.xx-p20"></span>“While they themselves also with
supplication.” ‘For in respect of these things,’ saith he, ‘they give
thanks to God, but in respect of your love and your coming together,
they beseech Him that they may be counted worthy to see you. For they
long after this, not for the money’s sake, but that they may be
witnesses of the grace that hath been bestowed upon you.’ Seest thou
Paul’s wisdom, how after having exalted them, he ascribed the whole to
God by calling the thing “grace?” For seeing he had spoken great things
of them, in that he called them ministers and exalted them unto a great
height, (since they offered service <span
id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md) whilst he himself did but
administer <span id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875) ,.md) and termed them
‘proved <span id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) ,’ he shows that God was
the Author of all these things. And he himself again, along with them,
sends up thanksgiving, saying,

<span id="v.xx-p24"></span>[2 Cor.
9.15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015.md)<span id="v.xx-p24.1"></span>.
“Thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift.”

<span id="v.xx-p25"></span>And here he calls “gift,” even those so many
good things which are wrought by almsgiving, both to them that receive
and them that give; or else, those unspeakable good things which through
His advent He gave unto the whole world with great munificence, which
one may suspect to be the most probable. For that he may at once both
sober, and make them more liberal, he puts them in mind of the benefits
they had received from God. For this avails very greatly in inciting
unto all virtue; and therefore he concluded his discourse with it. But
if His Gift be unspeakable, what can match their frenzy who raise
curious questions as to His Essence? But not only is His Gift
unspeakable, but that “peace” also “passeth all understanding,”
([Philip. iv. 7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.xx-p25.1"></span>.) whereby He reconciled the things which are
above with those which are below.

<span id="v.xx-p26"></span>\[3.\] Seeing then that we are in the
enjoyment of so great grace, let us strive to exhibit a virtue of life
worthy of it, and to make much account of almsgiving. And this we shall
do, if we shun excess and drunkenness and gluttony. <span
id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md)   For God gave meat and drink not for
excess, but for nourishment. For it is not the wine that produceth
drunkenness, for if that were the case, every body would needs be
drunken. ‘But,’ saith one, ‘it would be better, if even to drink it
largely did not injure.’ These are drunkards’ words. For if to drink it
largely doth injure, and yet not even so thou desistest from thy excess
in it; if this is so disgraceful and injurious, and yet thou ceasest not
even so from thy depraved longing; if it were possible both to drink
largely and be nothing harmed, where wouldest thou have stayed in thine
excess? Wouldest thou not have longed that the rivers even might become
wine? wouldest thou not have destroyed and ruined everything? If there
is a mean in food which when we overpass we are injured, and yet even so
thou canst not bear the curb, but snapping it as under seizest on what
every body else hath, to minister to the wicked tyranny of this
gluttony; what wouldest thou not have done, if this natural mean were
abolished? wouldest thou not have spent thy whole time upon it? Would it
then have been well to strengthen a lust so unreasonable, and not
prevent the harm arising from excess? and to how many other harms would
not this have given birth?

<span id="v.xx-p28"></span>But O the senseless ones! who wallowing as in
mire, in drunkeness and all other debauchery, <span id="page_374">p.
374</span> <span id="v.xx-Page_374"></span>when they have got a little
sober again, sit down and do nothing but utter such sort of sayings,
‘Why doth this end <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) in this way?’
when they ought to be condemning their own transgressions. For instead
of what thou now sayest, ‘Why hath He set bounds? why do not all things
go on without any order?’ say, ‘Why do we not cease from being drunken?
why are we never satiated? why are we more senseless than creatures
without reason?’  For these things they ought to ask one another, and to
hearken to the voice of the Apostle and learn how many good things he
witnesseth to the Corinthians proceed from almsgiving, and to seize upon
this treasure. For to contemn money maketh men approved, as he said; and
provideth that God be glorified; and warmeth love; and worketh in men
loftiness of soul; and constituteth them priests, yea of a priesthood
that bringeth great reward. For the merciful man is not arrayed in a
vest reaching to the feet, nor does he carry about bells, nor wear a
crown; but he is wrapped in the robe of loving-kindness, a holier than
the sacred vestment; and is anointed with oil, not composed of material
elements, but produced <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) by the
Spirit, and he beareth a crown of mercies, for it is said, “Who crowneth
thee with pity and mercies;” ([Ps. ciii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004)<span id="v.xx-p30.2"></span>..md) and
instead of wearing a plate bearing the Name of God, is himself like to
God. For how? “Ye,” saith He, “shall be like <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) unto your Father which is in heaven.”
([Matt. v. 45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md)<span
id="v.xx-p31.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.xx-p32"></span>Wouldest thou see His altar also? Bezaleel
built it not, nor any other but God Himself; not of stones, but of a
material brighter than the heaven, of reasonable souls. But the priest
entereth into the holy of holies. Into yet more awful places mayest thou
enter when thou offerest this sacrifice, where none is present but “thy
Father, Which seeth in secret,” ([Matt. vi.
4](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#004)<span id="v.xx-p32.1"></span>..md) where
no other beholdeth. ‘And how,’ saith one, ‘is it possible that none
should behold, when the altar standeth in public view?’ Because this it
is that is admirable, that in those times double doors and veils made
the seclusion: but now, though doing thy sacrifice in public view, thou
mayest do it as in the holy of holies, and in a far more awful manner.
For when thou doest it not for display before men; though the whole
world hath seen, none hath seen, because thou hast so done it. For He
said not simply, “Do” it “not before men,” but added, “to be seen of
them.” ([Matt. vi. 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.xx-p32.2"></span>.) This altar is composed of the very members of
Christ, and the body of the Lord is made thine altar. That then revere;
on the flesh of the Lord thou sacrificest the victim. This altar is more
awful even than this which we now use, not only than that used of old.
Nay, clamor not. For this altar is admirable because of the sacrifice
that is laid upon it: but that, the merciful man’s, not only on this
account, but also because it is even composed of the very sacrifice
which maketh the other to be admired. Again, this is but a stone by
nature; but become holy because it receiveth Christ’s Body:  but that is
holy because it is itself Christ’s Body. So that this beside which thou,
the layman, standest, is more awful than that. Whether then does Aaron
seem to thee aught in comparison of this, or his crown, or his bells, or
the holy of holies? For what need is there henceforth to make our
comparison refer to Aaron’s altar, when even compared with this, it has
been shown to be so glorious? But thou honorest indeed this altar,
because it receiveth Christ’s body; but him that is himself the body of
Christ thou treatest with contumely, and when perishing, neglectest.
This altar mayest thou everywhere see lying, both in lanes and in market
places, and mayest sacrifice upon it every hour; for on this too is
sacrifice performed. And as the priest stands invoking the Spirit, so
dost thou too invoke the Spirit, not by speech, but by deeds. For
nothing doth so sustain and kindle the fire of the Spirit, as this oil
largely poured out. But if thou wouldest see also what becomes of the
things laid upon it, come hither, and I will show thee them. What then
is the smoke, what the sweet savor of this altar? Praise and
thanksgiving. And how far doth it ascend? as far as unto heaven? By no
means, but it passeth beyond the heaven itself, and the heaven of
heaven, and arriveth even at the throne of the King. For, “Thy prayers,”
saith he, “and thine alms are come up before God.” ([Acts x.
4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004)<span id="v.xx-p32.3"></span>..md) And
the sweet savor which the sense perceives pierceth not far into the air,
but this opened the very vault of heaven. And thou indeed art silent,
but thy work speaketh <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md) : and a
sacrifice of praise is made, no heifer slain nor hide burnt, but a
spiritual soul presenting her proper offering. For such a sacrifice is
more acceptable than any loving-kindness. When then thou seest a poor
believer, think that thou beholdest an altar:  when thou seest such an
one a beggar, not only insult him not, but even reverence him, and if
thou seest another insulting him, prevent, repel it. For so shalt thou
thyself be able both to have God propitious to thee, and to obtain the
promised good things, whereunto may we all attain, through the grace and
love towards men of our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom and with Whom, to the
Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and forever, and
world without end. Amen.
