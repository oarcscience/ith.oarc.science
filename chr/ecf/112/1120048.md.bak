id="iv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Homily XLIV.</span>

<span id="iv.xlv-p2"></span><span id="iv.xlv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xlv-p2.2"></span>[1 Cor. xvi.
10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.xlv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xlv-p3"></span>*Now if Timothy come to you* <span
id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) *, see that he be with you without
fear.*

<span id="iv.xlv-p5"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="iv.xlv-p5.1"></span>Perhaps</span> some one may think there is
something unworthy of Timothy’s courage in this piece of advice. But not
on Timothy’s account is this said, but for the hearers’ sake: lest by
their design against him they should hurt themselves: since he for his
part had his station always in the way of dangers <span
id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) .

<span id="iv.xlv-p7"></span>“For as a child serveth a father,” saith he,
“so he served with me in furtherance of the Gospel.” ([Philip. ii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022)<span id="iv.xlv-p7.1"></span>..md) But
lest from boldness towards the disciple they should proceed also to the
teacher, and become worse, he checks them from afar off, saying, “that
he may be with you without fear;” that is, that none of those desperate
persons rise up against him. For he intended perhaps to rebuke them
about the things concerning which Paul also had written: and indeed Paul
professed to send him for this very reason. “For I have sent Timothy
unto you,” saith he, (c. [1 Cor.
4.17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017)<span id="iv.xlv-p7.2"></span>..md)
“who shall put you in remembrance of my ways in Christ even as I teach
every where in every Church.” In order then that they might not through
confidence in their high birth and wealth, and the support of the
people, and the wisdom from without, attack him and spit upon him and
plot against him, being grieved at the reproofs which came from him; or
lest in revenge for the teacher’s rebuke they should demand satisfaction
of him, so punishing the other; therefore he saith, “that he be without
fear with you.” As if he had said, “Tell me not of those who are
without, the Gentiles and unbelievers. It is your part that I require,
you for whom also the whole Epistle was composed,” the persons also whom
in the beginning and the outset he had frightened. Wherefore he saith,
“with you.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p8"></span>Then in virtue of his ministry he sets him
forth as a person to be fully trusted; saying “For the work of the Lord
he worketh.” That is; “look not,” saith he, “to this, his not being
rich, namely, nor highly educated, nor old: but what commands are laid
upon him, what work he is doing. ‘For the work of the Lord he worketh.’”
And this serves him instead of all nobility and wealth and age and
wisdom.

<span id="iv.xlv-p9"></span>And he is not content with this, but adds,
“Even as I also.” And some way above, “Who is my beloved son and
faithful in the Lord; he shall put you in remembrance of my ways in
Christ.” Seeing then that he was both young, and had been singly
entrusted with the improvement of so numerous a people, both of which
things tended to bring him into contempt, he adds, as we might expect,

<span id="iv.xlv-p10"></span>[1 Cor.
16.11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p10.1"></span>.
“Let no one therefore despise him.” And not this only doth he demand of
them, but also greater honor; wherefore also he saith, “but set him
forward in peace;” that is, without fear; causing no fightings or
contentions, no enmities or hatreds, but rendering all subjection as to
a teacher.

<span id="iv.xlv-p11"></span>“That he may come unto me: for I expect him
with the brethren.” This also was the language of one that would alarm
them. That is, in order that they might become more considerate, as
knowing that all would be told him whatever Timothy’s treatment might
be, he adds therefore, “for I expect him.” And besides, hereby he both
shows that Timothy is worthy of their confidence; since being on the
point of departing he waits for him; and also signifies the love which
he hath towards them, it appearing that for their sakes he sent away one
so useful to him.

<span id="iv.xlv-p12"></span>[1 Cor.
16.12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p12.1"></span>.
“But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto
you with the brethren.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p13"></span>This man appears to have been both
well-educated and also older than Timothy. Lest they should say then,
“For what possible reason did he not send the man grown, but the youth
instead of him?” observe how he softens down this point also, both
calling him a brother, and saying that he had besought him much. For
lest he should seem to have held Timothy in higher honor than him and to
have exalted him more, and on this account not to have sent him, and
cause their envy to burst out more abundantly, he adds, “I besought him
much to come.” What then: did not the other yield nor con<span
id="page_264">p. 264</span> <span id="iv.xlv-Page_264"></span>sent? did
he resist and show himself contentious? He saith not this, but that he
might not excite prejudice against him, and also might make excuse for
himself, he saith, “and it was not at all his will to come now.” Then to
prevent their saying that all this was an excuse and pretence, he added,
“but he will come to you when he shall have opportunity.” This was both
an excuse for him, and a refreshment to them who desired to see him, by
the hope which it gave of his coming.

<span id="iv.xlv-p14"></span>\[2.\] Afterwards indicating that not in
the teachers but in themselves they ought to have their hopes of
salvation, he saith,

<span id="iv.xlv-p15"></span>[1 Cor.
16.13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p15.1"></span>.
“Watch ye, stand fast in the faith.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p16"></span>Not in the wisdom which is without: for
there it is not possible to stand, but to be borne along; even as “in
the faith” ye may “stand.” “Quit you like men, be strong.” “Let all that
ye do be done in love.” Now in saying these things, he seems indeed to
advise; but he is reprimanding them as indolent. Wherefore he saith,
“Watch,” as though they slept; “Stand,” as though they were rocking to
and fro: “Quit you like men,” as though they were playing the coward:
“Let all that ye do be done in love,” as though they were in
dissensions. And the first caution refers to the deceivers, viz.,
“Watch,” “stand:” the next, to those who plot against us, “Quit you like
men:” the third, to those who make parties and endeavor to distract,
“Let all that ye do be done in love;” which thing is “the bond of
perfectness,” and the root and fountain of all blessings.

<span id="iv.xlv-p17"></span>But what means, “All things in love?”
“Whether any one rebuke,” saith he, “or rule or be ruled, or learn or
teach, let all be in love:” since in fact all the things which have been
mentioned arose from neglect of it. For if this had not been neglected,
they would not have been puffed up, they would not have said, “I am of
Paul, and I of Apollos.” If this had existed, they would not have gone
to law before heathens, or rather they would not have gone to law at
all. If this had existed, that notorious person would not have taken his
father’s wife: they would not have despised the weak brethren; there
would have been no factions among them; they would not have been
vain-glorious about their gifts. Therefore it is that he saith, “Let all
things be done in love.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p18"></span>\[3.\] [1 Cor.
16.15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p18.1"></span>.
“Now I beseech you, brethren;—ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is
the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to
minister unto the saints.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p19"></span>In the beginning too he mentions this man,
saying, “I baptized also the home of Stephanas:” and now he speaks of
him as “the first-fruits” not of Corinth only, but also of all Greece.
And this too is no small encomium that he was the first to come to
Christ. Wherefore also in the Epistle to the Romans, praising certain
persons on this account, he said, “Who also were in Christ before me.”
([Rom. xvi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.xlv-p19.1"></span>.) And he said not, that they were the first
who believed, but were the “first-fruits;” implying that together with
their faith they showed forth also a most excellent life, in every way
proving themselves worthy, as in the case of fruits. For so the
first-fruits ought to be better than the rest of those things whereof
they are the first-fruits:  a kind of praise which Paul hath attributed
to these also by this expression: namely, that they not only had a
genuine faith, as I was saying, but also they exhibited great piety, and
the climax of virtue, and liberality in alms-giving.

<span id="iv.xlv-p20"></span>And not from hence only, but from another
topic likewise he indicates their piety, i.e., from their having filled
their whole house also with godliness.

<span id="iv.xlv-p21"></span>And that they flourished in good works
also, he declares by what follows, saying, “They have set themselves to
minister unto the saints.” Hear ye, how vast are the praises of their
hospitality? For he did not say, “they minister,” but, “have set
themselves:” this kind of life they have chosen altogether, this is
their business in which they are always busy.

<span id="iv.xlv-p22"></span>“That ye also be in subjection unto such,
that is, “that ye take a share with them both in expenditure of money,
and in personal service: that ye be partakers with them.” For both to
them the labor will be light when they have comrades, and the results of
their active benevolence will extend to more.

<span id="iv.xlv-p23"></span>And he said not merely, “be
fellow-helpers,” but added, “whatsoever directions they give, obey;”
implying the strictest obedience. And that he might not appear to be
favoring them, he adds, “and to every one that helpeth in the work and
laboreth.” “Let this,” saith he, “be a general rule:  for I do not speak
about them individually, but if there be any one like them, let him also
have the same advantages.” And therefore when he begins to commend, he
calls upon themselves as witnesses, saying, “I beseech you, ye know the
house of Stephanas.” “For ye also yourselves are aware,” saith he, “how
they labor, and have no need to learn from us.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p24"></span>[1 Cor.
16.17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p24.1"></span>.
“But I was glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus,
for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p25"></span>[1 Cor.
16.18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p25.1"></span>.
“For they refreshed my spirit and yours.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p26"></span>Thus, since it was natural for them to be
<span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="iv.xlv-Page_265"></span>greatly irritated against these persons, for
it was they who had come and showed him all about the division, inasmuch
as by them also they had written the questions about the virgins, and
about the married persons:—mark how he softened them down; both in the
beginning of his Epistle by saying, “For it hath been signified unto me
by them which are of the house of Chloe;” thus at once concealing these
and bringing forward the others: (for it should seem that the latter had
given their information by means of the former:)  and in this place
again, “They have supplied your lack, and refreshed my spirit and
yours:” signifying that they had come instead of all, and had chosen to
undertake so great a journey on their behalf. How then may this, their
peculiar praise, become common? “If you will solace me for what was
wanting on your part by your kindness towards them; if you will honor,
if you will receive, them, if you will communicate with them in doing
good.” Wherefore he saith, “Acknowledge ye then them that are such.” And
while praising those that came, he embraces also the others in his
praise, the senders together with the sent: where he saith, “‘They
refreshed my spirit and yours, therefore acknowledge such as these,’
because for your sakes they left country and home.” Dost thou perceive
his consideration? He implies that they had obliged not Paul only, but
the Corinthians likewise, in that they bore about in themselves the
whole city. A thing which both added credit to them, and did not allow
the others to sever themselves from them, inasmuch as in their persons
they had presented themselves to Paul.

<span id="iv.xlv-p27"></span>[1 Cor.
16.19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p27.1"></span>.
“All the Churches of Asia salute you.” He is continually making the
members combine and cleave together in one by means of the salutation.

<span id="iv.xlv-p28"></span>“Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in
the Lord;”—for with them he was lodging, being a tent-maker—“with the
Church which is in their house.” This thing too is no small excellency,
that they had made their very house a Church.

<span id="iv.xlv-p29"></span>\[4.\] [1 Cor.
16.20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p29.1"></span>.
“All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with an holy kiss.”
This addition of the “holy kiss” he makes only <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) here. What may the reason be?  They
had been widely at variance with one another on account of their saying,
“I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ;” on
account of “one being hungry, and another drunken;” on account of their
having contentions and jealousies and suits. And from the gifts there
was much envying and great pride. Having then knit them together by his
exhortation, he naturally bids them use the holy kiss <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) also as a means of union: for this
unites, and produces one body. This is holy, when free from deceit and
hypocrisy.

<span id="iv.xlv-p32"></span>[1 Cor.
16.21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p32.1"></span>.
“The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand;” intimates that the
Epistle was composed with great seriousness; and therefore he added,

<span id="iv.xlv-p33"></span>[1 Cor.
16.22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p33.1"></span>.
“If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p34"></span>By this one word he strikes fear into all:
those who made their members the members of an harlot; those who put
stumbling blocks in the way of their brethren by the things offered in
sacrifice unto idols; those who named themselves after men; those who
refuse to believe the resurrection. And he not only strikes fear, but
also points out the way of virtue and the fountain of vice, viz. that as
when our love towards Him hath become intense, there is no kind of sin
but is extinguished and cast out thereby; so when it is too weak, it
causes the same to spring up.

<span id="iv.xlv-p35"></span>“*Maran atha*.” <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md)   For what reason is this word used?
And wherefore too in the Hebrew-tongue? Seeing that arrogance was the
cause of <span id="page_266">p. 266</span> <span
id="iv.xlv-Page_266"></span>all the evils, and this arrogance the wisdom
from without produced, and this was the sum and substance of all the
evils, a thing which especially distracted Corinth; in repressing their
arrogance he did not even use the Greek tongue, but the Hebrew:
signifying that so far from being ashamed of that sort of simplicity, he
even embraces it with much warmth.

<span id="iv.xlv-p38"></span>But what is the meaning of “*Maran atha*?”
“Our Lord is come.” For what reason then doth he use this phrase in
particular? To confirm the doctrine of the Economy: out of which class
of topics more than any other he hath put together those arguments which
are the seeds of the Resurrection <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) . And not only this, but also to
rebuke them; as if he had said, “The common Lord of all hath
condescended to come down thus far, and are ye in the same state, and do
ye abide in your sins? Are ye not thrilled with the excess of His love,
the crown of His blessings?  Yea, consider but this one thing,” saith
he, “and it will suffice thee for progress in all virtue, and thou shalt
be able to extinguish all sin.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p40"></span>[1 Cor.
16.23](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p40.1"></span>.
“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p41"></span>This is like a teacher, to help not only
with advice, but also with prayers.

<span id="iv.xlv-p42"></span>[1 Cor.
16.24](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p42.1"></span>.
“My love be with you all in Christ Jesus, Amen.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p43"></span>Thus to hinder them from thinking that in
flattery to them he so ended, he saith, “In Christ Jesus.” It having
nothing in it human or carnal, but being of a sort of spiritual nature.
Wherefore it is thoroughly genuine. For indeed the expression was that
of one who loves deeply. As thus; because he was separated from them as
regards place, as it were by the stretching out of a right hand he
incloses them with the arms of his love, saying, “My love be with you
all;” just as if he said, “With all of you I am.” Whereby he intimates
that the things written came not of wrath or anger, but of provident
care, seeing that after so heavy an accusation he doth not turn himself
away, but rather loves them, and embraces them when they are afar off,
by these epistles and writings throwing himself into their arms.

<span id="iv.xlv-p44"></span>\[5.\] For so ought he that corrects to do:
since he at least, who acts merely from anger is but satisfying his own
feeling; but he who after correcting the sinner renders also the offices
of love, shows that those words also, whatsoever he spake in reproof,
were words of fond affection. Just so let us too chasten one another;
and let neither the corrector be angry, (for this belongs not to
correction, but to passion,) nor let him that is corrected take it ill.
For what is done is healing, not despite. Now if physicians use cautery
and are not found fault with, and that too, frequently, though they
quite miss their object; but even in their pain the subjects of the
cautery and amputation esteem as benefactors those who excite this pain;
much more ought he who receives reproof to be so disposed, and as to a
physician so to give heed to the corrector, and not as to an enemy. And
let us also who rebuke approach with great gentleness, with great
prudence. And if thou seest a brother committing sin, as Christ
commanded, make not your rebuke public, but “between thee and him
alone:” ([Matt. xviii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.xlv-p44.1"></span>.) not reproaching nor insulting over him when
down, but in pain and with a melting heart <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) . And show thyself ready also to
receive reproof, if thou commit error in any thing.

<span id="iv.xlv-p46"></span>Now that what I say may be plainer, let us
put an imaginary case and so try our rule. For God forbid that in very
deed we should be provided with such an illustration of it. Suppose any
brother dwelling in the same house with a virgin, in honor and chastity,
and yet not even so quite escaping evil report. <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md)   If then you should hear talk of this
their dwelling together, be not contemptuous, nor say, “Why, hath he no
understanding? Doth he not himself know what is for his good? Get love
for nothing, but do not for nothing get hatred. Why, what have I to do
with taking up a gratuitous enmity?” These are the doting words of wild
beasts, or rather of demons: for it is not so that he is hated for
nothing who doth this for his brother’s correction, rather it is for
great blessings and crowns unutterable.

<span id="iv.xlv-p48"></span>But if thou sayest, “What? hath he no
understanding?” thou shalt hear from me that he hath not:  drunken as he
is with his passion. For if in the heathen courts of justice, <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) those who are injured must not speak
for themselves while glowing with wrath; (although there be no fault in
that kind of sympathy;) how much more those whom evil habit holds in
subjection. Wherefore I say that manifold as his wisdom may be, he hath
not his mind awake. For what can be wiser than David, the man who said,
“The dark and the hidden things of Thy wisdom Thou hast made known unto
me?” ([Ps. 51.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.xlv-p49.1"></span><span id="page_267">p. 267</span> <span
id="iv.xlv-Page_267"></span>. ap. LXX. l. 6.) But when he looked on the
wife of the soldier with unjust eyes, then according to what he himself
said ([Ps. cvii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.xlv-p49.2"></span>.) of those who sail on the raging sea, “all
his wisdom was swallowed up;” and he stood in need of others to correct
him, and did not even perceive amidst what evils he was. Wherefore also,
bewailing his offences, he said, “As a heavy burden they weighed
grievously upon me: my wounds stank and were corrupt because <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) of my folly.” ([Ps. xxxviii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005)<span id="iv.xlv-p50.2"></span>..md) He
therefore that committeth sin hath no understanding. For he is drunken
and is in darkness. Do not then say these things, neither add that other
remark, “I care not at all about it. ‘For each man shall bear his own
burden.’” ([Gal. vi. 5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.xlv-p50.3"></span>.) Nay, against thyself also it grows up into a
grievous accusation, that seeing one in error thou dost not restore him.
For if it was not right according to the law of the Jews ([Exod.
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#005)<span id="iv.xlv-p50.4"></span>..md) to
slight the beast of one’s enemy; he who despises not the beast of burden
nor yet the soul of an enemy perishing, but that of a friend, what
pardon shall he obtain?

<span id="iv.xlv-p51"></span>Yea, neither is it enough for our excuse
that he hath understanding: since we too after our many and manifold
exhortations have not been sufficient, nor proved useful, unto
ourselves. Bear this in mind then in regard to him also that is in
error; that it is natural he should receive the best counsel rather from
thee than from himself.

<span id="iv.xlv-p52"></span>And say not, “But what care I about these
things?” Fear thou him who first spoke this word; for the saying, “Am I
my brother’s keeper?” ([Gen. iv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#009)<span id="iv.xlv-p52.1"></span>..md)
tends to the same point as this. This is the mother of all our evils
that we esteem the concerns of our own body as foreign to us. What
sayest thou?  Thou carest not for thy brother? Who then is to care for
him? the unbeliever who rejoices over and reproaches and insults him? or
the devil who urges him on and supplants him?

<span id="iv.xlv-p53"></span>And whence comes this? “How do I know that
I shall accomplish anything,” saith he, “though I speak and advise what
is right.” But how is it clear that thou wilt do no good? Why, this
again is extreme folly, while the end remains in obscurity to incur the
manifold blame of confessed indifference. And yet God who foresees the
future often speaks and doth no good; yet doth He not even so give up;
and that, knowing that He shall not even persuade men. Now if He who
knows beforehand that He shall win no advantage, ceases not from the
work of correction, what excuse wilt thou have, who art completely
ignorant of the future and yet faintest and art benumbed? Yea, and many
have succeeded by frequent attempts: and when they most of all
despaired, then did they most gain their point. And though thou
shouldest gain no advantage, thou hast done thine own part.

<span id="iv.xlv-p54"></span>Be not then inhuman, nor unmerciful, nor
careless: for that these words come of cruelty and indifference is plain
from what follows: viz. What is the reason that when one of the members
of thy body is in pain, thou sayest not, “What care I?” Yet whence is it
plain, that if it be taken due care of, it is restored? And yet thou
leavest nothing undone, that even although thou profit not, thou mayest
not have to blame thyself for the omission of any thing which ought to
have been done. Hereupon I ask, are we to take such care for the members
of our body and to neglect those of Christ? Nay, how can such things
deserve pardon? For if I make no impression upon thee by saying, “Have a
care of thine own member;” in order that thou mayest become better were
it only through fear, I put thee in mind of the body of Christ. But how
can it be other than a matter of horror to see His flesh putrefying, and
neglect it? And if thou hadst a slave or an ass afflicted with a
mortifying sore, thou couldest not have the heart to neglect it: but
seest thou the Body of Christ full of scurvy <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) , and hurriest by? and thinkest not
that such things deserve innumerable thunder-bolts? For this cause all
things are turned upside down, because of this our inhumanity, because
of our indifference. Wherefore now, I beseech you, let this cruelty be
cast out from among us.

<span id="iv.xlv-p56"></span>\[6.\] Draw near to him whom I speak of, as
dwelling with a virgin, and speak some small praise of thy brother,
making it up from the other excellencies which he hath. And foment him
with thy commendations as it were with warm water, and so mitigate the
tumor of his wound. Speak of thyself also as wretched; accuse the common
race of mankind; point out that we are all in sins; ask for pardon,
saying, that thou art undertaking things too great for thee, but love
persuades thee to dare all things. Then in giving thine advice, do it
not imperiously, but in a brotherly way. And when by all these means
thou hast reduced the swelling and soothed the pain arising from the
cutting reproof which is in store for him, and when thou hast again and
again deprecated and besought him not to be angry: when thou hast bound
him down with these things, then use the knife; neither pressing the
matter too close, nor yet undoing it; that he may neither fly off on the
one hand, nor on the other think little of it. For if thou strike not to
the quick thou hast done no good, and if thy blow be violent, thou
makest him start away.

<span id="iv.xlv-p57"></span><span id="page_268">p. 268</span> <span
id="iv.xlv-Page_268"></span>Wherefore, even after all this, being on the
very point of the reproof, mix up again commendation with thy censures.
And seeing that this proceeding considered in itself cannot be matter of
praise, (for it is not commendable to keep house with a damsel that is a
virgin;) let the purpose of him who doth so be thy topic for effecting
this; and say, “I know indeed that thou doest it for God’s sake, and
that the desolation and unprotected state of that poor woman met thine
eye, and caused thee to stretch out thine hand to her.” And although he
may not be doing it with this intention, do thou speak so; and after
this add what follows also; again excusing thyself and saying, “These
things I speak not to direct but to remind thee. Thou doest it for God’s
sake; I too know that. But let us see whether another evil be not
produced thereby. And if there be none, keep her in thine house, and
cling to this excellent purpose. There is no one to hinder thee. But if
any mischief arise from hence exceeding the advantage, let us take care,
I beseech you, lest while we are earnest to comfort one soul, we put a
stumbling-block in the way of ten thousand.” And do not add immediately
the punishments due to those who give offence, but take his own
testimony also, saying, “Thou hast no need to learn these things from
me: thou thyself knowest, ‘if any one offend one of these little ones,’
how great a penalty is threatened. And thus, having sweetened thy speech
and smoothed down his wrath, apply the medicine of thy correction. And
should he again urge her forlorn condition, do not thou even so expose
his pretence, but say to him, “Let nothing of this sort make you afraid:
thou wilt have an ample plea, the offence given to others: since not for
indifference, but in care towards them, didst thou cease from this thy
purpose.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p58"></span>And let the matter of thine advice be
brief, for there is no need of much teaching; but let the expressions of
forbearance on the other hand be many and close upon one another. And
continually have thou recourse to the topic of love; throwing into shade
the painfulness of what thou sayest, and giving him his full power, and
saying, “This is what I for my part advise and recommend; but about
taking the advice thou art only judge: for I do not compel and force
thee, but submit the whole thing to thine own discretion.”

<span id="iv.xlv-p59"></span>If we so manage our reproof, we shall
easily be able in correct those in error: even as what we now do is
surely more like the conduct of wild beasts or irrational creatures than
of men. For if any persons now perceive any one committing errors of
this kind, with the person himself they do not at all confer, but
themselves, like silly old women who have drunk too much, whisper with
another. And the saying, “Get love for nothing, but do not get hatred
for nothing,” hath not here any place in their opinion. But, when they
have a fancy to speak evil, they mind not being “hated for nothing,”
rather I should say, “being punished;” since it is not hatred alone that
is hereby produced, but also punishment. But when there is need of
correction, they allege both this, and innumerable other pretexts.
Whereas then would be the time to think of these things, when thou
speakest evil, when thou calumniatest; I mean the saying, “Be not hated
for nothing,” and “I can do nothing,” and “it is no care of mine.” But
as things are, in the former case, thou art vehemently and idly curious,
and carest not for hatred and ills innumerable; but when thou shouldest
be taking thought for the salvation of thy brother, then it is thy
pleasure to be a sort of unofficious, inoffensive person. And yet from
evil speaking arises hatred both on God’s part and on men’s; and this is
no great care to thee: but by giving advice privately, and reproofs of
that kind, both he and God will be made thy friends. And even should he
hate thee, God goes on loving thee the rather on this account. Nay, in
fact, not even so will he hate thee, as when his hatred came from thine
evil speaking: but in that case he will avoid thee as a foe and an
enemy, whereas now he will consider thee more venerable than any father.
And if he apparently take it ill, inwardly and privately he will feel
much obliged to thee.

<span id="iv.xlv-p60"></span>\[7.\] Bearing in mind these things
therefore let us have a care of our own members, and not sharpen the
tongue against one another, nor speak words “which may do hurt, <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) ” undermining the fame of our
neighbor, and as in war and battle, giving and receiving blows. For what
after all is the good of fasting or watching, when the tongue is
drunken, and feasts itself at a table more unclean than of dog’s flesh;
when it is grown ravening after blood, and pours out filth, and makes
the mouth a channel of a sewer, nay rather something more abominable
than that? For that which proceeds from thence pollutes the body:  but
what comes from the tongue often suffocates the soul.

<span id="iv.xlv-p62"></span>These things I say, not in anxiety about
those who have an ill report falsely: for they are worthy even of
crowns, when they bear what is said nobly; but in anxiety for you that
so speak. For him that is evil reported of falsely, the Scriptures
pronounce “blessed;” but the evil-speaker they expel from the holy
Mysteries, nay even from the very precincts. For it is <span
id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span id="iv.xlv-Page_269"></span>said,
([Ps. ci. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.xlv-p62.1"></span>.) “Him that privily speaketh against his
neighbor, this man did I chase out.” And he saith too that such a one is
unworthy to read the sacred books. For, “Why,” saith He, ([Ps. l.
16](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#016)<span id="iv.xlv-p62.2"></span>..md)
“dost thou declare My righteous laws, and takest My covenant in thy
mouth?” Then, annexing the cause He saith ([Psa.
50.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#020)<span id="iv.xlv-p62.3"></span>..md)
“Thou satest and spakest against thy brother.” And here indeed he doth
not distinctly add whether they be things true or false which he speaks.
But elsewhere this too makes part of His prohibition: He implying, that
even though thou speak truths, yet such things are not to be uttered by
thee. For, “Judge not,” saith He,” that ye be not judged:” ([Matt. vii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001)<span id="iv.xlv-p62.4"></span>..md)
since he too who spoke evil of the publican was condemned, although it
was true which he laid to his neighbor’s charge.

<span id="iv.xlv-p63"></span>“What then,” you will say, “if any one be
daring and polluted, must we not correct him? must we not expose him?”
We must both expose and correct: but in the way which I mentioned
before. But if thou do it upbraiding him, take heed lest thine imitation
of that Pharisee cause thee to fall into his state. For no advantage
accrues from hence; none to thee who speakest, none to him who hears
thee, none to the person accused. But the latter, for his part, becomes
more reckless: since as long as he is unobserved, he is sensible of
shame; but as soon as he becomes manifest and notorious, he casts off
the curb also which that feeling imposed on him.

<span id="iv.xlv-p64"></span>And the hearer will in his turn be yet more
injured. For whether he be conscious to himself of good deeds, he
becomes puffed and swoln up with the accusation brought against another;
or of faults, he then becomes more eager for iniquity.

<span id="iv.xlv-p65"></span>Thirdly, the speaker too himself will both
incur the bad opinion of the hearer, and will provoke God to more anger
against himself.

<span id="iv.xlv-p66"></span>Wherefore, I beseech you, let us cast from
us every word that is unsavory. If there be any thing good unto
edification, this let us speak.

<span id="iv.xlv-p67"></span>But hast thou a fancy to avenge thyself on
the other person? Why then punish thyself instead of him? Nay, do thou,
who art so earnestly seeking redress from those who have annoyed thee,
avenge thyself as Paul recommended to take vengeance. “If thine enemy
hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink.” ([Rom. xii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020)<span id="iv.xlv-p67.1"></span>..md)
But if thou do not so, but only plot against him, thou pointest the
sword against thyself.

<span id="iv.xlv-p68"></span>Wherefore if that other speak evil, answer
him with praises and commendations. For so wilt thou be able both to
take vengeance on him, and wilt deliver thyself from evil surmising.
Since he that feels pain at hearing ill of himself, is thought to be so
affected because of some consciousness of evil:  but he that laughs to
scorn what is said, exhibits a most unquestionable token of his not
being conscious to himself of any evil thing. <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md)

<span id="iv.xlv-p70"></span>Seeing then that thou profitest neither
thine hearer, nor thyself, nor him that is accused, and dost but point
thy sword at thine own self, even from such considerations do thou learn
more soberness. For one ought indeed to be moved by the thought of the
kingdom of heaven, and of what pleases God: but since thou art of
grosser disposition and bitest like a wild beast, hereby even be thou
instructed; that these arguments having corrected thee, thou mayest be
able to order thyself simply from consideration of what pleases God; and
having come to be above every passion, mayest obtain the heavenly
blessings:—which may God grant us all to obtain, through the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and His mercy towards mankind; with Whom, to the
Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory, power, honor, now and henceforth,
and unto everlasting ages. Amen.

<span id="iv.xlv-p30"></span> \[It seems quite certain that the orator
was incorrectly reported here. For this direction is found in the Second
Epistle ([2 Cor. 13.12](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.xlv-p30.1"></span>), and also at the close of First Thessalonians

16.16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016)<span id="iv.xlv-p30.3"></span>.md).
But his explication of the meaning is correct. Tertullian (*de
Oratione*, xviii.) speaks of it as “the kiss of peace,” and on this
account it was eminently fitting that the distracted Church of Corinth
should not omit a salutation so significant. The qualifying epithet
“holy” was added, not as Chrysostom says in his Homily on the passage in
Second Corinthians, in order to distinguish it from a hollow kiss such
as Judas gave to our Lord, but to denote its religious and Christian
character. It was not a mere expression of domestic kinship and
friendliness, but a recognition of the tender relation existing between
each believer and all the other members of Christ’s mystical person. It
required to be free from deceit and hypocrisy, but it also needed to be
given and received as a pledge of mutual forgiveness and love, otherwise
the whole object of the salutation failed. C.\]

id="iv.xlv-p30.4"></span>

<span id="iv.xlv-p31"></span> That is, the kiss of peace, constantly
used as part of the ceremonial of the holy Eucharist; as appears by all
the Primitive Liturgies.

id="iv.xlv-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xlv-p36"></span> \[Chrysostom gives correctly the object of
this solemn utterance. It was surely to strike terror into all who by
contentiousness, by profligacy, by covetousness, by litigiousness, by
idolatry, by arrogance, or in any other way showed that they were
destitute of love to Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. For such there
is no outlook in the future but perdition. But the answers to the other
questions proposed are not so happy. The use of the East Aramæan term
*Maran atha* is hardly to be accounted for by supposing that the Apostle
wished to cross the conceit of the Corinthians in their Hellenic
language and wisdom, although it is harsh in Meyer to pronounce this
“singularly absurd.” In the absence of any direct clew to the purpose it
is well to accept the opinion of Calvin that the Apostle roused by the
gravity of the occasion could not satisfy himself without clothing in
the older and more sacred dialect the tremendous truth which gave such
solemn weight to the anathema. A similar feeling seems to lie at the
root of the use of the corresponding terms, *Abba* in [Mark
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036.md), [Rom.
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md), [Gal.
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.xlv-p36.1"></span>,
(Compare the Hebrew words *Abaddon* and *Armageddon* in the Apocalypse.)

<span id="iv.xlv-p37"></span>So in regard to the meaning of the words
*Maran atha*. They can just as well bear the rendering “The Lord cometh”
as that which Chrysostom gives, “The Lord has come” and the connection
renders the latter far more likely, notwithstanding Jerome, Erasmus and
Castalio agree with the Greek Fathers. Hence nearly all modern
interpreters hold that there is a reference to the final Parousia. It is
a solemn warning that the approaching advent of the Son of Man would
bring about the execution of the dreadful curse, just as in the 25th
chapter of Matthew the sentence of the *cursed* is said to be announced
and put in force when “the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the
angels with him.” The reference to the incarnation has significance as
emphasizing the greatness of the sin of those who love not the Lord, but
the reference to the Second Advent has much more as it exhibits and
enforces the certainty and severity of the doom that awaits all such
sinners. C.\]

of her affairs, if rich, and to maintain her in charity, if poor.…On the
other hand, the clergy said they cast on them the burden of their
household, and those trifling cares for which women are most proper, in
order to be more at liberty for the offices of their ministry. For the
rest, they affirmed that in this intimacy there was no sort of criminal
liberty, not at all making the less profession of continence. So
Chrysostom maintained the contrary; and we have two whole discourses of
his on this subject, which seem to have been written about this time,”
the time of his promotion to the see of Constantinople. Fleury, *E. H*.
