1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004.md)<span id="v.i-p9.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ through the
will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the Church of God, which is
at Corinth, with all the saints which are in the whole of Achaia:  grace
to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed
be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies
and God of all comfort; Who comfort us in all our affliction, that we
may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction through the
comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

<span id="v.i-p11"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.i-p11.1"></span>It</span> is meet to enquire, first, why to the
former Epistle he adds a second: and what can be his reason for thus
beginning with the mercies and consolation of God.

<span id="v.i-p12"></span>Why then does he add a second Epistle? Whereas
in the first he had said, “I will come to you, and will know not the
word of them which are puffed up, but the power;” ([1 Cor. iv.
19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019)<span id="v.i-p12.1"></span>..md) and
again towards the end had promised the same in milder terms, thus, “I
will come unto you when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I do
pass through Macedonia; and it may be that I shall abide, or even winter
with you;” ([1 Cor. 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006)<span id="v.i-p12.2"></span>..md) yet
now after along interval, he came not; but was still lingering and
delaying even though the time appointed had passed away; the Spirit
detaining him in other matters of far greater necessity than these. For
this reason he had need to write a second Epistle, which he had not
needed had he but a little out-tarried his time. <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md)

<span id="v.i-p14"></span>But not for this reason only, but also because
they were amended by the former; for him that had committed fornication
whom before they applauded and were puffed up about, they had cut off
and separated altogether. And this he shows where he says, “But if any
hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow not to me, but in part (that I
press not too heavily) to you all. Sufficient to such a one is this
punishment which was inflicted by the many.” ([2 Cor.
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006)<span id="v.i-p14.1"></span>..md) And
as he proceeds, he alludes again to the same thing when he says, “For
behold that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it
wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation,
yea, what fear, yea, what longing, yea, what zeal, yea, what avenging! 
In every thing ye approved yourselves to be pure in this matter.” ([2
Cor. vii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.i-p14.2"></span>.)  Moreover, the collection <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) which he enjoined, they gathered with
much forwardness. Wherefore also he says, “For I know your readiness of
which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been
prepared for a year past.” ([2 Cor. ix.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002)<span id="v.i-p15.4"></span>..md) And
Titus too, whom he sent, they received with all kindness, as he shows
when he says again, “His inward affection is more abundantly toward you,
whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and
trembling ye received him.” ([2 Cor. vii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#015)<span id="v.i-p15.5"></span>..md) For
all these reasons he writes the second Epistle. For it was right <span
id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span id="v.i-Page_272"></span>that, as when
they were in fault he rebuked them, so upon their amendment he should
approve and commend them. On which account the Epistle is not very
severe <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) throughout, but only in a
few parts towards the end. For there were even amongst them Jews who
thought highly of themselves, and accused Paul as being a boaster and
worthy of no regard; whence also that speech of theirs; “His letters are
weighty, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account:”
([2 Cor. x. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.i-p16.2"></span>.) meaning thereby, when he is present he appears
of no account, (for this is the meaning of, “his bodily presence is
weak,”) but when he is away he boasts greatly in what he writes, (for
such is the signification of “his letters are weighty.”)  Moreover, to
enhance their own credit these persons made a pretence of receiving
nothing, to which he also alludes where he says, “that wherein they
glory, they may be found even as we.” ([2 Cor. xi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012)<span id="v.i-p16.3"></span>..md) And
besides, possessing also the power of language, they were forthwith
greatly elated. Wherefore also he calls himself “rude in speech,” ([2
Cor. xi. 6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.i-p16.4"></span>.) showing that he is not ashamed thereof; nor
deems the contrary any great acquisition. Seeing then it was likely that
by these persons some would be seduced, after commending what was right
in their conduct, and beating down their senseless <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) pride in the things of Judaism, in
that out of season they were contentious to observe them, he administers
a gentle <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) rebuke on this subject
also.

<span id="v.i-p19"></span>\[2.\] Such then, to speak summarily and by
the way, appears to me the argument of this Epistle. It remains to
consider the introduction, and to say why after his accustomed
salutation he begins, as he does, with the mercies of God. But first, it
is necessary to speak of the very beginning, and inquire why he here
associates Timothy with himself. For, he saith, “Paul an Apostle of
Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy our brother.” In the
first Epistle he promised he would send him; and charged them, saying,
“Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear.” ([1 Cor.
xvi. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010)<span id="v.i-p19.1"></span>..md)
How then is it that he associates him here in the outset with himself?
After he had been amongst them, agreeably to that promise of his
teacher, “I have sent unto you Timothy who shall put you in remembrance
of my ways which be in Christ,” ([1 Cor. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017)<span id="v.i-p19.2"></span>..md) and
had set everything in order, he had returned back to Paul; who on
sending him, had said, “Set him forward on his journey in peace that he
may come to me, for I expect him with the brethren.” ([1 Cor. xvi.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011)<span id="v.i-p19.3"></span>..md)

<span id="v.i-p20"></span>Since then Timothy was restored to his
teacher, and after having with him set in order the things in Asia,
(for, says he, “I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost,” [1 Cor. xvi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008)<span id="v.i-p20.1"></span>;.md) had
crossed again into Macedonia; Paul not unreasonably associates him
hereafter as abiding with himself. For then he wrote from Asia, but now
from Macedonia. Moreover, thus associating him he at once gains
increased respect for him, and displays his own exceeding humility <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) : for Timothy was very inferior to
himself, yet doth love bring all things together. Whence also he
everywhere makes him equal with himself; at one time saying, “as a child
serveth a father so he served with me;” ([Philip. ii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022)<span id="v.i-p21.2"></span>..md) at
another, “for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do;” ([1 Cor.
xvi. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010)<span id="v.i-p21.3"></span>..md)
and here, he even calleth him, “brother;” by all making him an object of
respect to the Corinthians amongst whom he had been, as I have said, and
given proof of his worth.

<span id="v.i-p22"></span>“To the Church of God which is at Corinth.”
Again he calleth them “the Church,” to bring and bind them all together
in one. For it could not be one Church, while those within her were
sundered and stood apart. “With all the saints which are in the whole of
Achaia. In thus saluting all through the Epistle addressed to the
Corinthians, he would at once honor these, and bring together the whole
nation. But he calls them “saints,” thereby implying that if any be an
impure person, he hath no share in this salutation. But why, writing to
the mother city, does he address all through her, since he doth not so
everywhere? For instance, in his Epistle to the Thessalonians he
addressed not the Macedonians also; and in like manner in that to the
Ephesians he doth not include all Asia; neither was that to the Romans
written to those also who dwell in Italy. But in this Epistle he doth
so; and in that to the Galatians. For there also he writeth not to one
city, or two, or three, but to all who are scattered every where,
saying, “Paul an Apostle, (not from men neither through man, but through
Jesus Christ, and God the Father, Who raised Him from the dead,) and all
the brethren which are with me, unto the Churches of Galatia. Grace to
you and peace.” ([Gal. i. 1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.i-p22.1"></span>.) To the Hebrews also he writes one Epistle to
all collectively; not distinguishing them into their several cities.
What then can be the reason of this?  Because, as I think, in this case
all were involved in one common disorder, wherefore also he addresses
them in common, as needing one common remedy. For the Galatians were all
of them infected. So too were the Hebrews, and so I think these
(Achaians) also.

<span id="v.i-p23"></span><span id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span
id="v.i-Page_273"></span>\[3.\] So then having brought the whole nation
together in one, and saluted them with his accustomed greeting, for,
saith he, “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ:” ([2 Cor. i. 2](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.i-p23.1"></span>.) hear how aptly to the purpose in hand he
begins, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of mercies and God of all comfort.” ([2 Cor.
1.3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003)<span id="v.i-p23.2"></span>..md) Do
you ask, how is this aptly to the purpose in hand? I reply, Very much
so; for observe, they were greatly vexed and troubled that the Apostle
had not come to them, and that, though he had promised, but had spent
the whole time in Macedonia; preferring as it seemed others to
themselves. Setting himself then to meet this feeling <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) against him, he declares the cause of
his absence; not however directly stating it, as thus; “I know, indeed,
I promised to come, but since I was hindered by afflictions forgive me,
nor judge me guilty of any sort of contempt or neglect towards you:” but
after another manner he invests the subject at once with more dignity
and trustworthiness, and gives it greatness by the nature of the
consolation <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) , so that thereafter
they might not so much as ask the reason of his delay. Just as if one,
having promised to come to one he longed for, at length arriving after
dangers innumerable, should say, “Glory to Thee, O God, for letting me
see the sight so longed for of his dear countenance!  Blessed be Thou, O
God, from what perils hast Thou delivered me!” for such a doxology is an
answer to him who was preparing to find fault, and will not let him so
much as complain of the delay; for one that is thanking God for
deliverance from such great calamities he cannot for shame drag to the
bar, and bid clear himself of loitering. Whence Paul thus begins,
“Blessed be the God of mercies,” implying by the very words that he had
been both brought into and delivered from mighty perils. For as David
also doth not address God every where in one way or with the same
titles; but when he is upon battle and victory, “I will love Thee, he
saith, O Lord my strength; the Lord is my buckler <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) :” when again upon delivery from
affliction and the darkness which overwhelmed him, “The Lord is my light
and my salvation;” ([Ps. xxvii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.i-p26.3"></span>.) and as the immediate occasion suggests, he
names Him now from His loving-kindness, now from His justice, now from
His righteous judgment:—in like way Paul also here at the beginning
describeth Him by His loving-kindness, calling Him “the God of mercies,”
that is, “Who hath showed me so great mercies as to bring me up from the
very gates of death.”

<span id="v.i-p27"></span>And thus to have mercy is the peculiar and
excellent attribute of God, and the most inherent in His nature; whence
he calleth Him the “God of mercies.”

<span id="v.i-p28"></span>And observe, I pray you, herein also the
lowly-mindedness of Paul. For though he were in peril because of the
Gospel he preached; yet saith he not, he was saved for his merit, but
for the mercies of God. But this he afterwards declareth more clearly,
and now goes on to say, “Who comforteth us in all affliction.” ([2 Cor.
i. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004)<span id="v.i-p28.1"></span>..md) He
saith not, “Who suffereth us not to come into affliction:” but, “Who
comforteth in affliction.” For this at once declareth the power of God;
and increaseth the patience of those afflicted. For, saith he,
“tribulation worketh patience.” ([Rom. v.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003)<span id="v.i-p28.2"></span>..md) And so
also the prophet, “Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress.”
([Ps. iv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.i-p28.3"></span>.) He doth not say, “Thou hast not suffered me to
fall into affliction,” nor yet, “Thou hast quickly removed my
affliction,” but, whilst it continueth, “Thou hast set me at large:”
([Dan. iii. 21](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#021.md)<span
id="v.i-p28.4"></span>. &c.) that is, “hast granted me much freedom and
refreshment.” Which truly happened also in the case of the three
children, for neither did He prevent their being cast into the flame,
nor when so cast, did He quench it, but while the furnace was burning He
gave them liberty. And such is ever God’s way of dealing; as Paul also
implies when he says, “Who comforteth us in all affliction.”

<span id="v.i-p29"></span>But he teaches something more in these words:
Do you ask what? Namely, that God doeth this not once, nor twice, but
without intermission. For He doth not one while comfort, another not,
but ever and constantly. Wherefore he saith, “Who comforteth,” not, “Who
hath comforted,” and, “in all affliction,” not, “in this or that,” but,
“in all.”

<span id="v.i-p30"></span>“That we may be able to comfort them which are
in any affliction through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are
comforted of God.” See you not how he is beforehand <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) with his defence by suggesting to the
hearer the thought of some great affliction; and herein also is his
modesty again apparent, that he saith not for their own merits was this
mercy showed, but for the sake of those that need their assistance;
“for,” saith he, “to this end hath He comforted us that we might comfort
one another.” And hereby also he manifesteth the excellency of the
Apostles, shewing that having been comforted and breathed awhile, he
lieth not softly down as we, but goeth on his way to anoint <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) , to nerve, to rouse others. Some,
however, consider this as the Apostle’s meaning. “Our consolation is
that of others also:” but my opinion is that in <span id="page_274">p.
274</span> <span id="v.i-Page_274"></span>this introduction, he is also
censuring the false Apostles, those vain boasters who sat at home and
lived in luxury; but this covertly and, as it were, incidentally, the
leading object being to apologise for his delay. “For,” \[he would
say,\] “if for this end we were comforted that we might comfort others
also, do not blame us that we came not; for in this was our whole time
spent, in providing against the conspiracies, the violence, the terrors
which assailed us.”

<span id="v.i-p33"></span>\[4.\] “For as the sufferings of Christ abound
unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.” Not to
depress the disciples by an aggravated account of his sufferings; he
declareth on the other hand that great and superabundant was the
consolation also, and lifteth up <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md)
their heart not hereby alone, but also by putting them in mind of Christ
and calling the sufferings “His,” and  <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) prior to the consolation deriveth a
comfort from the very sufferings themselves. For what joy can I have so
great as to be partaker with Christ, and for His sake to suffer these
things? What consolation can equal this? But not from this source only
does he raise the spirits of the afflicted, but from another also. Ask
you what other? In that he saith, “abound:” for he doth not say, “As the
sufferings of Christ” are “in us,” but as they “abound,” thereby
declaring that they endure not His sufferings only, but even more than
these <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) . For, saith he, “not
whatsoever He suffered, that have we suffered; “but even more <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) ,” for, consider, “Christ was cast
out, persecuted, scourged, died,” but we, saith he, “more than all
this,” which even of itself were consolation enough. Now let no one
condemn this speech of boldness; for he elsewhere saith, “Now I rejoice
in my sufferings, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the
afflictions of Christ in my flesh.” ([Col. i.
24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024)<span id="v.i-p37.2"></span>..md) Yet
neither here nor there is it from boldness or any presumptousness. For
as they wrought greater miracles than He according to that saying of
His, “he that believeth on Me shall do greater works than these,” ([John
xiv. 12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012)<span id="v.i-p37.3"></span>..md)
but all is of Him that worketh in them; so did they suffer also more
than He, but all again is of Him that comforteth them, and fitteth them
to bear the evils that betide them.

<span id="v.i-p38"></span>With which respect Paul aware how great a
thing he had said, doth again remarkably restrain it by adding, “So our
comfort also aboundeth through Christ;” thus at once ascribing all to
Him, and proclaiming herein also His loving-kindness; for, he saith not,
“As our affliction, such our consolation;” but “far more;” for, he saith
not, “our comfort is equal to our sufferings,” but, “our comfort
aboundeth,” so that the season of struggles was the season also of fresh
crowns. For, say, what is equal to being scourged for Christ’s sake and
holding converse with God; and being more than match for all things, and
gaining the better of those who cast us out, and being unconquered by
the whole world, and expecting hence such good things “as eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man!” ([1
Cor. ii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.i-p38.1"></span>.) And what is equal to suffering affliction for
godliness’ sake, and receiving from God consolations infinite, and being
rescued from sins so great, and counted worthy of the Spirit, and of
being sanctified and justified, and regarding no man with fear and
trembling, and in peril itself outshining all.

<span id="v.i-p39"></span>\[5.\] Let us then not sink down when tempted.
For no self-indulger hath fellowship with Christ, nor sleeper, nor
supine \[person\], nor any of these lax and dissolute livers. But Whoso
is in affliction and temptation, this man standeth near to Him, whoso is
journeying on the narrow way. For He Himself trode this; whence too He
saith, “the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head.” So then grieve
not when thou art in affliction; considering with Whom thou hast
fellowship, and how thou art purified by trials; and how great gain is
thine. For there is nothing miserable save the offending against God;
but this apart, neither afflictions nor conspiracies, nor any other
thing hath power to grieve the right-minded soul: but like as a little
spark, if thou cast it into a mighty deep, thou presently puttest it
out, so doth even a total and excessive sorrow if it light on a good
conscience easily die away and disappear.

<span id="v.i-p40"></span>Such then was the spring of Paul’s continual
joy: because in whatever was of God he was full of hope; and did not so
much as take count of ills so great, but though he grieved as a man yet
sank not. So too was that Patriarch encompassed with joy in the midst of
much painful suffering; for consider, he forsook his country, underwent
journeyings long and hard; when he came into a strange land, had “not so
<span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span id="v.i-Page_275"></span>much as
to set his foot on.” ([Acts vii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005)<span id="v.i-p40.1"></span>..md) Then
again a famine awaited him which made him once more a wanderer; after
the famine again came the seizure of his wife, then the fear of death,
and childlessness, and battle, and peril, and conspiracies, and at the
last that crowning trial, the slaying of his only-begotten and
true <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) son, that grievous
irreparable \[sacrifice.\] For think not, I pray you, that because he
readily obeyed, he felt not all the things he underwent. For though his
righteousness had been, as indeed it was, inestimable <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) , yet was he a man and felt as nature
bade. But yet did none of these things cast him down, but he stood like
a noble athlete, and for each one was proclaimed and crowned a victor.
So also the blessed Paul, though seeing trials in very snow-showers
assailing him daily, rejoiced and exulted as though in the mid-delights
of Paradise. As then he who is gladdened with this joy cannot be a prey
to despair; so he who maketh not this his own is easily overcome of all;
and is as one that hath unsound armor, and is wounded by even a common
stroke: but not so he who is well encased at all points, and proof
against every shaft that cometh upon him. And truly stouter than any
armor is joy in God; and whoso hath it, nothing can ever make his head
droop or his countenance sad, but he beareth all things nobly. For what
is worse to bear than fire? what more painful than continual torture?
truly it is more overpowering <span id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) in
pain than the loss of untold wealth, of children, of any thing; for,
saith he, “Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his
life.” ([Job ii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.i-p43.2"></span>.) So nothing can be harder to bear than bodily
pain; nevertheless, because of this joy in God, what even to hear of is
intolerable, becomes both tolerable and longed for: and if thou take
from the cross or from the gridiron the martyr yet just breathing, thou
wilt find such a treasure of joy within him as admits not of being told.

<span id="v.i-p44"></span>\[6.\] And doth any one say, What am I to
do <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) ; for now is no time of
martyrdom? What sayest thou? Is now no time of martyrdom? Never is it
not a time; but ever is it before our eyes; if we <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) will keep them open. For it is not the
hanging on a cross only that makes a Martyr, for were this so, then was
Job excluded from this crown; for he neither stood at bar, nor heard
Judge’s voice, nor looked on executioner; no, nor while hanging on tree
aloft had his sides mangled; yet he suffered worse than many martyrs;
more sharply than any stroke did the tale of those successive messengers
strike, and goad him on every side: and keener the gnawings of the worms
which devoured him in every part than thousand executioners.

<span id="v.i-p47"></span>Against what martyr then may he not worthily
be set? Surely against ten thousand. For in every kind \[of suffering\]
he both wrestled and was crowned; in goods, and children, and person,
and wife, and friends, and enemies, and servants, (for these too even
did spit in his face,) in hunger and visions and pains and noisomeness;
it was for this I said he might worthily be set, not against one nor two
nor three, but against ten thousand Martyrs. For besides what I have
mentioned, the time also maketh a great addition to his crown; in that
it was before the Law, before Grace, he thus suffered, and that, many
months, and each in its worst form; and all these evils assailed him at
once. And yet each individual evil by itself intolerable, even that
which seemeth most tolerable, the loss of his goods. For many have
patiently borne stripes, but could not bear the loss of their goods; but
rather than relinquish any part of them were content even to be scourged
for their sake and suffer countless ills; and this blow, the loss of
goods, appeared to them heavier than all. So then here is another method
of martyrdom for one who bears this loss nobly. And doth any ask, How
shall we bear it nobly? When thou hast learned that by one word of
thanksgiving thou shalt gain more than all thou hast lost. For if at the
tidings of our loss we be not troubled, but say, “Blessed be God,” we
have found far more abundant riches. For truly such great fruit thou
shalt not reap by expending all thy wealth on the needy, by going about
and seeking out the poor, and scattering thy substance to the hungry, as
thou shalt gain by the same word. And so neither Job do I admire so much
in setting wide his house to the needy, as I am struck with and extol
his taking the spoiling of his substance thankfully. The same in the
loss of children it happeneth to see. For herein, also, reward no less
than his who offered <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) his son and
presented him in sacrifice shalt thou receive, if as thou seest thine
die thou shalt thank the God of love. For how shalt such an one be less
than Abraham? He saw not his son stretched out a corpse, but only looked
to do so. So if he gain in the comparison by his purpose to slay and his
stretching forth his hand to take the knife, ([Gen. xxii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#010)<span id="v.i-p48.4"></span>..md) yet
doth he lose in that the child is lying dead here. And besides, he had
some comfort in the prospect of a good work done, and the thought that
this so excellent achievement was the work of his own fortitude, and
that the voice he heard came from above made him the readier. But here
is <span id="page_276">p. 276</span> <span id="v.i-Page_276"></span>no
such thing. So that he had need have a soul of adamant, who can bear
with calmness to see a child, his only one, brought up in affluence, in
the dawn <span id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) of fair promise, lying
upon the bier <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md) an outstretched
corpse. And should such an one, hushing to rest the heavings of nature,
be strengthened to say the words of Job without a tear, “The Lord gave,
the Lord hath taken away;” ([Job i.
21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021)<span id="v.i-p50.3"></span>..md) for
those words’ sake alone, he shall stand with Abraham himself and with
Job be proclaimed a victor. And if, staying the wailings of the women
and breaking up the bands of mourners, he shall rouse them all to sing
glory \[to God\], he shall receive above, below, rewards unnumbered; men
admiring, angels applauding, God crowning him.

<span id="v.i-p51"></span>\[7.\] And sayest thou, How is it possible for
one that is man not to mourn? I reply, If thou wilt reflect how neither
the Patriarch nor Job, who both were men, gave way to any thing of the
kind; and this too in either case before the Law, and Grace, and the
excellent wisdom of the laws \[we have\]: if thou wilt account that the
deceased has removed into a better country, and bounded away to a
happier inheritance, and that thou hast not lost thy son but bestowed
him henceforward in an inviolable spot. Say not then, I pray thee, I am
no longer called “father,” for why art thou no longer called so, when
thy son abideth? For surely thou didst not part with thy child nor lose
thy son?  Rather thou hast gotten him, and hast him in greater safety.
Wherefore, no longer shalt thou be called “father” here only, but also
in heaven; so that thou hast not lost the title “father,” but hast
gained it in a nobler sense; for henceforth thou shalt be called father
not of a mortal child, but of an immortal; of a noble soldier; on duty
continually within \[the palace\]. For think not because he is not
present that therefore he is lost; for had he been absent in a foreign
land, the title of thy relationship had not gone from thee with his
body. Do not then gaze on the countenance of what lieth there, for so
thou dost but kindle afresh thy grief; but away with thy thought from
him that lieth there, up to heaven. That is not thy child which is lying
there, but he who hath flown away and sprung aloft into boundless
height. When then thou seest the eyes closed, the lips locked together,
the body motionless, Oh be not these thy thoughts, “These lips no longer
speak, these eyes no longer see, these feet no longer walk, but are all
on their way to corruption!” Oh say not so: but say the reverse of this,
“These lips shall speak better, and the eyes see greater things, and the
feet shall mount upon the clouds; and this body which now rotteth away
shall put on immortality, and I shall receive my son back more glorious.
But if what thou seest distress thee, say to thyself the while, This is
\[only\] clothing and he has put it off to receive it back more
precious; this is an house and it is taken down to be restored in
greater splendor. For like as we, when purposing to take houses down,
allow not the inmates to stay, that they may escape the dust and noise;
but causing them to remove a little while, when we have built up the
tenement securely, admit them freely; so also doth God; Who taking down
this His decaying tabernacle hath received him the while into His
paternal dwelling and unto Himself, that when it hath been taken down
and built anew He may then return it to him more glorious.

<span id="v.i-p52"></span>Say not then, “He is perished and shall no
more be;” for these be the words of unbelievers; but say, “He sleepeth
and will rise again,” “He is gone a journey and will return with the
King.” Who sayeth this? He <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) that
hath Christ speaking in him. “For,” saith he, “if we believe that Jesus
died and rose again” and revived, “even so them also which sleep in
Jesus will God bring with Him.” ([1 Thess. iv.
14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014)<span id="v.i-p53.2"></span>..md) If
then thou seek thy son, there seek him where the King is, where is the
army of the Angels; not in the grave; not in the earth; lest whilst he
is so highly exalted, thyself remain grovelling on the ground.

<span id="v.i-p54"></span>If we have this true wisdom, we shall easily
repel all this kind of distress; and “the God of mercies and Father of
all comfort” comfort all our hearts, both those who are oppressed with
such grief and those held down with any other sorrow; and grant us
deliverance from all despair and increase of spiritual joy; and to
obtain the good things to come; whereunto may all we attain, through the
grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom unto the
Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, power, honor, now and
ever, and world without end. Amen.

<span id="v.i-p36"></span> St. Chrysostom does not, of course, mean, for
an instant, to compare the sufferings of the Apostles with those of our
Lord *in themselves*, but in one point only, their number. His
sufferings alone were meritorious and well-pleasing in themselves,
their’s in Him only; His turned away the Father’s wrath, their’s were
accepted by Him, when reconciled; His were spiritual also, their’s
bodily only; His were borne by His own power, through His divinity,
their’s not by their own, but through His indwelling Spirit; but, while
of course, beyond all thought inferior in every other respect, S.
Chrysostom infers from the Apostle’s words, that their bodily sufferings
outnumber His, though these also were, (he insists throughout) not
their’s, but His in these His members, bestowed by Him, borne through
Him and acceptable in Him. The whole comment is a development of the
word <span class="Greek"><span id="v.i-p36.1"></span>περισσεύει</span>
“aboundeth,” whence he infers that they were “more abundant,” <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.i-p36.2"></span>περισσά</span>: (as, plainly,
the bodily sufferings of the army of Martyrs have been more *numerous*.)
Yet though true, the statement, if repeated by one less reverent and not
corrected by the vivid consciousness that these too were His sufferings,
would become profane.
