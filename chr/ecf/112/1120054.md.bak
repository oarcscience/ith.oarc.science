<span id="v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="v.v-p1.1"></span>Homily V.</span>

<span id="v.v-p2"></span><span id="v.v-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.v-p2.2"></span>[2 Cor.
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013.md)<span id="v.v-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.v-p3"></span>Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of
Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord, I had no relief
for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother.

<span id="v.v-p4"></span><span class="c18"><span
id="v.v-p4.1"></span>These</span> words seem on the one hand to be
unworthy of Paul, if because of a brother’s absence he threw away so
great an opportunity of saving; and on the other, to hang apart from the
context. What then? Will ye that we should first prove that they hang
upon the context, or, that he hath said nothing unworthy of himself? As
I think, the second <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) , for so the
other point also will be easier and clearer.

<span id="v.v-p6"></span>How then do these (words) hang upon those
before them? Let us recall to mind what those were, and so we shall
perceive this. What then were those before? What he said at the
beginning. “I would not have you,” saith he, “ignorant concerning our
affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were weighed down
exceedingly, beyond our power.” ([2 Cor. i.
8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008)<span id="v.v-p6.1"></span>..md) Now
having shown the manner of his deliverance, and inserted the
intermediate matter, he is of necessity led to teach them again that in
yet another way he had been afflicted. How, and in what way? In not
finding Titus. ([2 Cor. 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006.md), [2 Cor.
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023.md), [2 Cor.
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018)<span id="v.v-p6.2"></span>..md)
Fearful indeed, and enough to prostrate the soul, is it even to endure
trials; but when there is none to comfort and that can help to bear the
burden, the tempest becometh greater. Now Titus is he, whom further on
he speaks of as having come to him from them, and of whom he runs
through many and great praises, and whom he said he had sent. With the
view then of showing that in this point also he had been afflicted for
their sakes, he said these things.

<span id="v.v-p7"></span>That the words then in question hang on what
went before is from all this plain. And I will <span id="page_301">p.
301</span> <span id="v.v-Page_301"></span>attempt to prove also that
they are not unworthy of Paul. For He doth not say that the absence of
Titus impeded the salvation of those who were about to come over, nor
yet that he neglected those that believed on this account, but that he
had no relief, that is, ‘I was afflicted, I was distressed for the
absence of my brother;’ showing how great a matter a brother’s absence
is; and therefore he departed thence. But what means, “when I came to
Troas, for the Gospel?” he saith not simply ‘I arrived,’ but ‘so as to
preach.’ But still, though I had both come for that and found very much
to do, (for “a door was opened unto me in the Lord,”) I had, saith he,
“no relief,” not that for this he impeded the work. How then saith he,

<span id="v.v-p8"></span>[2 Cor.
2.13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013.md)<span id="v.v-p8.1"></span>.
“Taking my leave of them, I went from thence?”

<span id="v.v-p9"></span>That is, ‘I spent no longer time, being
straitened and distressed.’ And perhaps the work was even impeded by his
absence. And this was no light consolation to them too. For if when a
door was opened there, and for this purpose he had come; yet because he
found not the brother, he quickly started away; much more, he saith,
ought ye to make allowance for the compulsion of those affairs which
lead us and lead us about everywhere, and suffer us not according as we
desire either to journey, or to tarry longer amongst those with whom we
may wish to remain. Whence also he proceeds in this place again to refer
his journeyings to God, as he did above to the Spirit, saying,

<span id="v.v-p10"></span>[2 Cor.
2.14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md)<span id="v.v-p10.1"></span>. “But
thanks be to God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and
maketh manifest through us the savor of His knowledge in every place.”

<span id="v.v-p11"></span>For that he may not seem as though in sorrow
to be lamenting these things, he sendeth up thanks to God. Now what he
saith is this: ‘Every where is trouble, every where straitness. I came
into Asia, I was burdened beyond strength. I came to Troas, I found not
the brother. I came not to you; this too bred in me no slight, yea
rather, exceeding great dejection, both because many among you had
sinned, and because on this account I see you not. For, “To spare you,”
he saith, “I came not as yet unto Corinth.” That then he may not seem to
be complaining in so speaking, he adds, ‘We not only do not grieve in
these afflictions, but we even rejoice; and, what is still greater, not
for the sake of the rewards to come only, but those too even which are
present. For even here we are by these things made glorious and
conspicuous. So far then are we from lamenting, that we even call the
thing a triumph <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) ; and glory in
what happeneth.’ For which cause also he said, “Now thanks be unto God,
Which always causeth us to triumph,” that is, ‘Who maketh us renowned
unto all. For what seemeth to be matter of disgrace, being persecuted
from every quarter, this appeareth to us to be matter of very great
honor.’ Wherefore he said not, “Which maketh us seen of all,” but,
“Which causeth us to triumph:” showing that these persecutions set up a
series <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) of trophies against the
devil in every part of the world. Then having mentioned along with the
author, the subject also of the triumph, he thereby also raiseth up the
hearer. ‘For not only are we made to triumph by God, but also “in
Christ;”’ that is, on account of Christ and the Gospel. ‘For seeing it
behooveth to triumph, all need is that we also who carry the trophy are
seen of all, because we bear Him. For this reason we become observed and
conspicuous.’

<span id="v.v-p14"></span>\[2.\] [2 Cor.
2.14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md)<span id="v.v-p14.1"></span>. “And
which maketh manifest through us the savor of His knowledge in every
place.”

<span id="v.v-p15"></span>He said above, “Which always causeth us to
triumph.” Here he saith “in every place,” showing that every place and
every time is full of the Apostles’ labors. And he uses yet another
metaphor, that of the sweet savor. For ‘like as those who bear ointment,
so are we,’ saith he, ‘manifest to all’; calling the knowledge a very
precious ointment. Moreover, he said not, ‘the knowledge;’ but “the
savor of the knowledge;” for such is the nature of the present
knowledge, not very clear nor uncovered. Whence also he said in the
former Epistle, “For now we see in a mirror darkly.” ([1 Cor. xiii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)<span id="v.v-p15.1"></span>..md) And
here he calls that which is such a “savor.” Now he that perceiveth the
savor knoweth that there is ointment lying somewhere; but of what nature
it is he knows not yet, unless he happens before to have seen it. ‘So
also we. That God is, we know, but what in substance we know not yet. We
are then, as it were, a Royal censer, breathing whithersoever we go of
the heavenly ointment and the spiritual sweet savor.’ Now he said this,
at once both to set forth the power of the Preaching, in that by the
very designs formed against them, they shine more than those who
prosecute them and who cause the whole world to know both their trophies
and their sweet savor: and to exhort them in regard to their afflictions
and trials to bear all nobly, seeing that even before the Recompense
they reap this glory inexpressible.

<span id="v.v-p16"></span>[2 Cor.
2.15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md)<span id="v.v-p16.1"></span>. “For
we are a sweet savor of Christ <span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span
id="v.v-Page_302"></span>unto God, in them that are saved and in them
that perish.”

<span id="v.v-p17"></span>Whether, saith he, one be saved or be lost,
the Gospel continues to have its proper virtue: and as the light,
although it blindeth the weakly, is still light, though causing
blindness; and as honey, though it be bitter to those who are diseased,
is in its nature sweet; so also is the Gospel of sweet savor, even
though some should be lost who believe it not. For not It, but their own
perverseness, worketh the perdition. And by this most of all is its
sweet savor manifested, by which the corrupt and vicious perish; so that
not only by the salvation of the good, but also by the perdition of the
wicked is its excellence declared. Since both the sun, for this reason
most especially that he is exceeding bright, doth wound the eyes of the
weak: and the Saviour is “for the fall and rising again of many,” ([Luke
ii. 34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034)<span id="v.v-p17.1"></span>..md)
but still He continueth to be a Saviour, though ten thousand fall; and
His coming brought a sorer punishment upon them that believe not, but
still it continueth to be full of healing <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) . Whence also he saith, “We are unto
God a sweet savor;” that is, ‘even though some be lost we continue to be
that which we are.’ Moreover he said not simply “a sweet savor,” but
“unto God.” And when we are a sweet savor unto God, and He decreeth
these things, who shall henceforth gainsay?

<span id="v.v-p19"></span>The expression also, “sweet savor of Christ,”
appears to me to admit of a double interpretation: for he means either
that in dying they offered themselves a sacrifice: or that they were a
sweet savor of the death of Christ, as if one should say, this incense
is a sweet savor of this victim. The expression then, sweet savor,
either signifieth this, or, as I first said, that they are daily
sacrificed for Christ’s sake. <span id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md)

<span id="v.v-p21"></span>\[3.\] Seest thou to what a height he hath
advanced the trials, terming them a triumph and a sweet savor and a
sacrifice offered unto God. Then, whereas he said, “we are a sweet
savor, even in them that perish,” lest thou shouldest think that these
too are acceptable, he added,

<span id="v.v-p22"></span>[2 Cor.
2.16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md)<span id="v.v-p22.1"></span>. “To
the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life
unto life.”

<span id="v.v-p23"></span>For this sweet savor some so receive that they
are saved, others so that they perish. So that should any one be lost,
the fault is from himself: for both ointment is said to suffocate swine,
and light (as I before observed,) to blind the weak. And such is the
nature of good things; they not only correct what is akin to them, but
also destroy the opposite: and in this way is their power most
displayed. For so both fire, not only when it giveth light and when it
purifieth gold, but even when it consumeth thorns, doth very greatly
display its proper power, and so show itself to be fire: and Christ too
herein also doth discover His own majesty when He “shall consume”
Antichrist “with the breath of His mouth, and bring him to nought with
the manifestation of His coming.” ([2 Thess. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)<span id="v.v-p23.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v-p24"></span>“And who is sufficient for these things?”

<span id="v.v-p25"></span>Seeing he had uttered great things, that ‘we
are a sacrifice of Christ and a sweet savor, and are every where made to
triumph,’ he again useth moderation, referring all to God. Whence also
he saith, “and who is sufficient for these things?” ‘for all,’ saith he,
‘is Christ’s, nothing our own.’ Seest thou how opposite his language to
the false Apostles’?  For they indeed glory, as contributing somewhat
from themselves unto the message: he, on the contrary, saith, he
therefore glorieth, because he saith that nothing is his own. “For our
glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that not in fleshly
wisdom, but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world.” And
that which they considered it a glory to acquire, I mean the wisdom from
without, he makes it his to take away. Whence also he here saith, “And
who is sufficient for these things?” But if none are sufficient, that
which is done is of grace.

<span id="v.v-p26"></span>[2 Cor.
2.17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md)<span id="v.v-p26.1"></span>. “For
we are not as the rest, which corrupt the word of God.”

<span id="v.v-p27"></span>‘For even if we use great sounding words, yet
we declared nothing to be our own that we achieved, but all Christ’s.
For we will not imitate the false apostles; the men who say that most is
of themselves.’ For this is “to corrupt,” when one adulterates the wine;
when one sells for money what he ought to give freely. For he seems to
me to be here both taunting them in respect to money, and again hinting
at the very thing I have said, as that they mingle their own things with
God’s; which is the charge Isaiah brings when he said, “Thy vintners
mingle wine with water:” ([Is. i.
22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022)<span id="v.v-p27.1"></span>, LXX..md)
for even if this was said of wine, yet one would not err in expounding
it of doctrine too. ‘But we,’ saith he, ‘do not so: but such as we have
been entrusted with, such do we offer you, pouring out the word
undiluted.’ Whence he <span id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span
id="v.v-Page_303"></span>added, “But as of sincerity, but as of God, in
the sight of God speak we in Christ.”

<span id="v.v-p28"></span>‘We do not,’ saith he ‘beguile you and so
preach, as conferring a gift on you, or as bringing in and mingling
somewhat from ourselves, “but as of God;” that is, we do not say that we
confer any thing of our own, but that God hath given all.’ For “of God”
means this; To glory in nothing as if we had it of our own, but to refer
every thing to Him. “Speak we in Christ.”

<span id="v.v-p29"></span>Not by our own wisdom, but instructed by the
power that cometh from Him. Those who glory speak not in this way, but
as bringing in something from themselves. Whence he elsewhere also turns
them into ridicule <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) , saying,
“For what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst
receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it.” ([1
Cor. iv. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.v-p30.2"></span>.) This is the highest virtue, to refer every
thing to God, to consider nothing to be our own, to do nothing out of
regard to men’s opinion, but to what God willeth. For He it is that
requireth the account. Now however this order is reversed: and of Him
that shall sit upon the tribunal and require the account, we have no
exceeding fear, yet tremble at those who stand and are judged with us.

<span id="v.v-p31"></span>\[4.\] Whence then is this disease? Whence
hath it broken out in our souls? From not meditating continually on the
things of that world, but being rivetted to present things. Hence we
both easily fall into wicked doings, and even if we do any good thing we
do it for display, so that thence also loss cometh to us. For instance,
one has looked on a person often with unbridled eyes, unseen of her or
of those who walk with her <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) , yet
of the Eye that never sleeps was not unseen. For even before the
commission of the sin, It saw the unbridled soul, and that madness
within, and the thoughts that were whirled about in storm and surge; for
no need hath He of witnesses and proofs Who knoweth all things. Look not
then to thy fellow-servants: for though man praise, it availeth not if
God accept not; and though man condemn, it harmeth not if God do not
condemn. Oh! provoke not so thy Judge; of thy fellow-servants making
great account, yet when Himself is angry, not in fear and trembling at
Him. Let us then despise the praise that cometh of men. How long shall
we be low-minded and grovelling? How long, when God lifteth us to
heaven, take we pains to be trailed <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) along the ground? The brethren of
Joseph, had they had the fear of God before their eyes, as men ought to
have, would not have taken their brother in a lonely place and killed
him. ([Gen. xxxvii](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.v-p33.2"></span>.) Cain again, had he feared that sentence as he
should have feared, would not have said, “Come, and let us go into the
field:” ([Gen. iv. 8](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.v-p33.3"></span>, LXX.) for to what end, O miserable and wretched!
dost thou take him apart from him that begat him, and leadest him out
into a lonely place? For doth not God see the daring deed even in the
field? Hath thou not been taught by what befel thy father that He
knoweth all things, and is present at all things that are done? And why,
when he denied, said not God this unto him: ‘Hidest thou from Me Who am
present every where, and know the things that are secret?’ Because as
yet he knew not aright to comprehend these high truths <span
id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) . But what saith he? “The voice of thy
brother’s blood crieth unto Me.” Not as though blood had a voice; but
like as we say when things are plain and clear, “the matter speaketh for
itself <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) .”

<span id="v.v-p36"></span>Wherefore surely it behoveth to have before
our eyes the sentence of God, and all terrors are extinguished. So too
in prayers we can keep awake, if we bear in mind with whom we are
conversing, if we reflect that we are offering sacrifice and have in our
hands a knife and fire and wood; if in thought we throw wide the gates
of heaven, if we transport ourselves thither and taking the sword of the
Spirit infix it in the throat of the victim:  make watchfulness the
sacrifice and tears the libation to Him. For such is the blood of this
victim. Such the slaughter that crimsons that altar. Suffer not then
aught of worldly thoughts to occupy thy soul then.  Bethink thee that
Abraham also, when offering sacrifice, suffered nor wife nor servant nor
any other to be present. Neither then do thou suffer any of the slavish
and ignoble passions to be present unto thee, but go up alone into the
mountain where he went up, where no second person is permitted to go up.
And should any such thoughts attempt to go up with thee, command them
with authority, and say, “Sit ye there, and I and the lad will worship
and return to you;” ([Gen. xxii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#005)<span id="v.v-p36.1"></span>. LXX..md)
and leaving the ass and the servants below, and whatever is void of
reason and sense, go up, taking with thee whatever is reasonable, as he
took Isaac. And build thine altar so as he, as having nothing human, but
having outstepped nature. For he too, had he not outstepped nature,
would not have slain his child. And let nothing disturb thee then, but
be lift up above the very heavens. Groan bitterly, sacrifice confession,
(for, saith he, “Declare thou first thy transgressions that thou mayest
be justified,” [Is. xliii. 26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026.md)<span
id="v.v-p36.2"></span>. LXX.), sacrifice contrition of heart. These
victims turn not to ashes nor <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span
id="v.v-Page_304"></span>dissolve into smoke nor melt into air; neither
need they wood and fire, but only a deep-pricked heart. This is wood,
this is fire to burn, yet not consume them. For he that prayeth with
warmth is burnt, yet not consumed; but like gold that is tried by fire
becometh brighter.

<span id="v.v-p37"></span>\[5.\] And withal observe heedfully one thing
more, in praying to say none of those things that provoke thy Master;
neither draw near \[to pray\] against enemies. For if to have enemies be
a reproach, consider how great the evil to pray against them. For need
is that thou defend thyself and show why thou hast enemies: but thou
even accusest <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) them. And what
forgiveness shalt thou obtain, when thou both revilest, and at such a
time when thyself needest much mercy. For thou drewest near to
supplicate for thine own sins: make not mention then of those of others,
lest thou recall the memory of thine own. For if thou say, ‘Smite mine
enemy,’ thou hast stopped thy mouth, thou hast cut off boldness from thy
tongue; first, indeed, because thou hast angered the Judge at once in
beginning; next, because thou asketh things at variance with the
character of thy prayer. For if thou comest near for forgiveness of
sins, how discoursest thou of punishment? The contrary surely was there
need to do, and to pray for them in order that we may with boldness
beseech this for ourselves also. But now thou hast forestalled the
Judge’s sentence by thine own, demanding that He punish them that sin: 
for this depriveth of all pardon. But if thou pray for them, even if
thou say nothing in thine own sins’ behalf, thou hast achieved all <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) . Consider how many sacrifices there
are in the law; a sacrifice of praise, a sacrifice of acknowledgment, a
sacrifice of peace <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) , a sacrifice
of purifications, and numberless others, and not one of them against
enemies, but all in behalf of either one’s own sins or one’s own
successes. For comest thou to another God? To him thou comest that said,
“Pray for your enemies.” ([Luke 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#027.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#035.md), [Rom.
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#014)<span id="v.v-p40.3"></span>..md)
How then dost thou cry against them? How dost thou beseech God to break
his own law? This is not the guise of a suppliant. None supplicates the
destruction of another, but the safety of himself. Why then wearest thou
the guise of a suppliant, but hast the words of an accuser? Yet when we
pray for ourselves, we scratch ourselves and yawn, and fall into ten
thousand thoughts; but when against our enemies, we do so wakefully. For
since the devil knows that we are thrusting the sword against ourselves,
he doth not distract nor call us off then, that he may work us the
greater harm. But, saith one, ‘I have been wronged and am afflicted.’
Why not then pray against the devil, who injureth us most of all. This
thou hast also been commanded to say, “Deliver us from the evil one.” He
is thy irreconcileable foe, but man, do whatsoever he will, is a friend
and brother. With him then let us all be angry; against him let us
beseech God, saying, “Bruise Satan under our feet;” ([Rom. xvi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020)<span id="v.v-p40.4"></span>..md) for
he it is that breedeth also the enemies \[we have\]. But if thou pray
against enemies, thou prayest so as he would have thee pray, just as if
for thine enemies, then against him. Why then letting him go who is
thine enemy indeed, dost thou tear thine own members, more cruel in this
than wild beasts. ‘But,’ saith one, ‘he insulted me and robbed me of
money;’ and which hath need to grieve, he that suffered injury, or he
that inflicted injury?  Plainly he that inflicted injury, since whilst
he gained money he cast himself out of the favor of God, and lost more
than he gained: so that he is the injured party. Surely then need is not
that one pray against, but for him, that God would be merciful to him.
See how many things the three children suffered, though they had done no
harm. They lost country, liberty, were taken captive and made slaves;
and when carried away into a foreign and barbarous land, were even on
the point of being slain on account of the dream, without cause or
object <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) . ([Dan. ii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#013)<span id="v.v-p41.2"></span>..md) What
then? When they had entered in with Daniel, what prayed they? What said
they? Dash down Nabuchodonosor, pull down his diadem, hurl him from the
throne? Nothing of this sort; but they desired “mercies of God.” ([Dan.
ii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#018.md)<span id="v.v-p41.3"></span>.
LXX.) And when they were in the furnace, likewise. But not so ye: but
when ye suffer far less than they, and oftentimes justly, ye cease not
to vent ten thousand imprecations. And one saith, ‘Strike down my enemy
as Thou overwhelmedst the chariot of Pharaoh;’ another, ‘Blast his
flesh;’ another again, ‘Requite it on his children.’ Recognize ye not
these words? Whence then is this your laughter? Seest thou how laughable
this is, when it is uttered without passion. And so all sin then
discovereth how vile it is, when thou strippest it of the state of mind
of the perpetrator. Shouldest thou remind one who has been angered of
the words which he said in his passion, he will sink for shame and scorn
himself and wish he had suffered a thousand punishments rather than
those words to be his. And shouldest thou, when the embrace is over,
bring the unchaste to the woman he sinned with, he too will turn away
from her as disgusting. And so do ye, because ye are not under the
influence of the passion, laugh now. <span id="page_305">p. 305</span>
<span id="v.v-Page_305"></span>For worthy to be laughed at are they, and
the words of drunken old gossips; and springing from a womanish
littleness of soul. And yet Joseph, though he had been sold and made a
slave, and had tenanted a prison, uttered not even then a bitter word
against the authors of his sorrows. But what saith he? “Indeed I was
stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews;” ([Gen. xl.
15](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#015)<span id="v.v-p41.4"></span>..md) and
addeth not by whom. For he feels more ashamed for the wickedness of his
brethren, than they who wrought them. Such too ought to be our
disposition, to grieve for them who wrong us more than they themselves
do. For the hurt passeth on to them. As then they who kick against
nails, yet are proud of it, are fit objects of pity and lamentation on
account of this madness; so they who wrong those that do them no evil,
inasmuch as they wound their own souls, are fit objects for many moans
and lamentations, not for curses. For nothing is more polluted than a
soul that curseth, or more impure than a tongue that offereth such
sacrifices. Thou art a man; vomit not forth the poison of asps. Thou art
a man; become not a wild beast. For this was thy mouth made, not that
thou shouldest bite but that thou shouldest heal the wounds of others.
‘Remember the charge I have given thee,’ saith God, ‘to pardon and
forgive. But thou beseechest Me also to be a party to the overthrow of
my own commandments, and devourest thy brother, and reddenest thy
tongue, as madmen do their teeth on their own members.’ How, thinkest
thou, the devil is pleased and laughs, when he hears such a prayer? and
how, God is provoked, and turneth from and abhorreth thee, when thou
beseechest things like these?  Than which, what can be more dangerous?
For if none should approach the mysteries that hath enemies: how must
not he, that not only hath, but also prayeth against them, be excluded
even from the outer courts themselves? Thinking then on these things,
and considering the Subject <span id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) of
the Sacrifice, that He was sacrificed for enemies; let us not have an
enemy: and if we have, let us pray for him; that we too having obtained
forgiveness of the sins we have committed, may stand with boldness at
the tribunal of Christ; to whom be glory for ever. Amen <span

<span id="v.v-p5"></span> So Chrysostom, referring apparently to the
first sentence in the Homily. It is manifest at least, that the
preceding sentence required “the former” here, and not “the second.”

<span id="v.v-p12"></span> \[The Rev. Vers. renders this clause “leadeth
us in triumph,” in accordance with Meyer, Beet, *et al*. The principal
reason is that the causative sense of the A.V. is against all
Hellenistic and New Testament usage, while on the other hand the
*neuter* sense of the verb to “triumph over us” easily passes into the
*transitive*, to lead us in triumph. C.\]

<span id="v.v-p20"></span> \[Rather the sense is a sweet-smelling savor
of Christ, something revealing, as perfumes do, the nature of that from
which it proceeds, and so a means of diffusing the knowledge of Christ.
There does not seem to be any reference to sacrifice, as Chrysostom
conceives, nor to the incense of the sanctuary, but simply to the
grateful and pervasive influence of a perfume. It cannot be hid. It
cannot be resisted. Wherever Paul went he diffused abroad the fragrance
of the name of Christ, and thus he pleased God. The “savor of Christ,”
therefore, is not the savor of which he is the author but that of which
he is the subject. A savor respecting Christ. The Gospel and those who
preach it are well-pleasing to God, as grateful to Him as the purest and
most fragrant incense, whether men receive it and are saved, or whether
they reject it and are lost. Chrysostom well brings out the solemn and
affecting truth that the sweet savor is manifested in both classes, in
them that perish as well as in them that are saved. C.\]
