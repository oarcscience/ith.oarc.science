### CHAPTER IX.

THIS CHAPTER SPEAKS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH GOD COMMUNICATES WITH THE
SOUL BY IMAGINARY VISIONS. STRONG REASONS ARE GIVEN FOR NOT DESIRING TO
BE LED IN THIS WAY; THIS IS VERY PROFITABLE READING.

*1. The jewel in the locket. 2. The simile explained. 3. The apparition
explained. 4. Awe produced by this vision. 5. False and genuine visions.
6. Illusive visions. 7. Effects of a genuine vision. 8. Conviction left
by a genuine vision. 9. Its effects upon the after conduct. 10. A
confessor should be consulted. 11. How to treat visions. 12. Effects of
seeing the face of Christ. 13. Reasons why visions are not to be sought.
14. The second reason. 15. Third reason. 16. Fourth reason. 17. Fifth
reason. 18. Sixth reason. 19. Additional reasons. 20. The virtues more
meritorious than consolations. 21. Fervent souls desire to serve God for
Himself alone*.

1\. Now we come to treat of imaginary visions, whereby it is held that
the devil is more liable to deceive people than by the other visions I
have already described. This is probably true. Yet when imaginary
visions are divine, they seem, in a certain manner, more profitable for
us than the others, as being more suited to our nature--with the
exception of the visions sent by our Lord in the seventh mansion which
far surpass all others. The presence of our Lord described in the last
chapter may thus be symbolized. Let us suppose that we have in our
possession a gold locket containing a precious stone of the highest
value and powers, which, though we have not seen it, we are certain

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

is in the case, and its virtues benefit us when we wear the pendant.
Although we have never gazed on it we value it highly, knowing by
experience that it has cured us of maladies for which it is remedial.
However, we dare not look at it nor open the locket nor could we do so
even if we wished, for the owner of the jewel alone knows the secret of
unfastening its casket. Although he lent it us for our use, yet he kept
the key for himself; he will open the trinket when he chooses to show us
its contents and close it again when he sees fit to do so.

2\. Our Lord treats us here in this way. Now, suppose the owner of this
locket suddenly opened it at times for the benefit of the person to whom
he has entrusted it; doubtless the latter would value the diamond more
highly through remembering its wonderful lustre. This may be compared to
what happens when our Lord is pleased to caress the soul. He shows it in
vision His most sacred Humanity under whatever form He chooses; either
as He was during His life on earth <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_356.md)
or after His resurrection. <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_357.md) The
vision passes as quickly as a flash of lightning, yet this most glorious
picture makes an impression on the imagination that I believe can never
be effaced until the soul at last sees Christ to enjoy Him for ever.
Although I call it a 'picture,' you must not imagine that it looks like
a painting; Christ appears as a living Person Who sometimes speaks and
reveals deep mysteries. You must understand that though the soul sees
this for a certain space of time, it is no more possible to continue

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

looking at it than to gaze for a very long time on the sun; therefore
this vision passes very quickly, although its brightness does not pain
the interior sight in the same way as the sun's glare injures our bodily
eyes.

3\. The image is seen by the interior sight alone; but of bodily
apparitions I can say nothing, for the person I know so intimately never
having experienced anything of the kind herself could not speak about
them with certainty. <span id="fr_358"></span>[3](#fn_358.md) The splendour
of Him Who is revealed in the vision resembles an infused light like
that of the sun covered with a veil as transparent as a diamond, if such
a texture could be woven, while His raiment looks like fine linen. The
soul to whom God grants this vision almost always falls into an ecstasy,
nature being too weak to bear so dread a sight. I say 'dread,' though
this apparition is more lovely and delightful than anything that could
be imagined even though any one should live a thousand years and spend
all that time in trying to picture it, for it far surpasses our limited
imagination and understanding; yet the presence of such surpassing
majesty inspires the soul with great fear.

4\. There is no need to ask how the soul knew Who He was or who declared
with absolute certainty that He was the Lord of heaven and earth. This
is not so with earthly kings; unless we were told their names or saw
their attendant courtiers, they would attract little notice. O Lord, how
little do we Christians know Thee! What will that day be in which Thou
comest as our Judge, since now,

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

when Thou comest as a Friend to Thy spouse, the sight of Thee strikes us
with such awe? O daughters! what will it be when He says in wrath: 'Go,
accursed of my Father?' <span id="fr_359"></span>[4](#fn_359.md)Let this
impression be the result of this favour granted by God to the soul and
we shall reap no little benefit from it, since St. Jerome, saint as he
was, ever kept the thought of the last judgment before his eyes. <span
id="fr_360"></span>[5](#fn_360.md) Thus we shall care nothing what
sufferings we endure from the austerities of our Rule, for long as they
may last, the time is but a moment compared to this eternity of pain. I
sincerely assure you that, wicked as I am, I have never feared the
torments of hell <span id="fr_361"></span>[6](#fn_361.md) for they have
seemed to me as nothing when I remembered that the lost would see the
beautiful, meek and pitiful eyes of our Lord turned on them in
wrath. <span id="fr_362"></span>[7](#fn_362.md) I have thought all my life
that this would be more than my heart could bear.

5\. How much more must any one fear this to whom our Lord so revealed
Himself in vision here as to overcome her feelings and produce
unconsciousness! This must be the reason that the soul remains in a
rapture: our Lord strengthens its weakness so as to unite it to His
greatness in this sublime communion with God. When any one

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

can contemplate this sight of our Lord for a long time, I do not believe
it is a vision but rather some overmastering idea which causes the
imagination to fancy it sees something; but this illusion is only like a
dead image in comparison with the living reality of the other case.

6\. As not only three or four, but a large number of people have spoken
to me on the subject, I know by experience that there are souls which,
either because they possess vivid imaginations or active minds, or for
some other reason of which I am ignorant, are so absorbed in their own
ideas as to feel certain they see whatever their fancy imagines. If they
had ever beheld a genuine vision, they would recognize the deception
unmistakably. They themselves fabricate, piece by piece, what they fancy
they see: no after effects are produced on the mind, which is less moved
to devotion than by the sight of a sacred picture. It is clear that no
attention should be paid to such fancies, which pass more quickly than
dreams from the memory.

7\. In the favour of which I speak, the case is very different. A person
is far from thinking of seeing anything, no idea of which has crossed
the mind, when suddenly the vision is revealed in its entirety, causing
within the powers and senses of the soul a fright and confusion soon
changed into a blissful peace. Thus, after St. Paul was thrown to the
ground, a great tempest and noise followed from heaven; <span
id="fr_363"></span>[8](#fn_363.md) so, in the interior world of the soul,
there is a violent tumult followed instantly, as I said, by

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

perfect calm. Meanwhile certain sublime truths have been so impressed on
the mind that it needs no other master, for with no effort of its own,
Wisdom Himself has enlightened its former ignorance.

8\. The soul for some time afterwards possesses such certainty that this
grace comes from God that whatever people may say to the contrary it
cannot fear delusion. Later on, when her confessor suggests doubts to
her, God may allow such a person to waver in her belief for a time and
to feel misgivings lest, in punishment for her sins, she may possibly
have been left to go astray. However, she does not give way to these
apprehensions, but (as I said in speaking of other matters) <span
id="fr_364"></span>[9](#fn_364.md) they only affect her in the same way as
the temptations of the devil against faith, which may disturb the mind
but do not shake the firmness of belief. In fact, the more severe the
assault, <span id="fr_365"></span>[10](#fn_365.md) the more certain is she
that the evil one could never have produced the great benefits she is
conscious of having received, because he exercises no such power over
the interior of the soul. He may present a false apparition but it does
not possess such truth, majesty, and efficacy.

9\. As confessors cannot see these effects, which perhaps the person to
whom God has shown the vision is unable to explain, they are afraid of
deception, as indeed they have good reason to be. Therefore caution is
necessary and time should be allowed to see what effects follow. Day by
day, the progress of the soul in humility and in the virtues should be
watched: if the devil is concerned in the matter, he will soon show
signs of himself and will

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

be detected in a thousand lies. If the confessor is experienced and has
received such favours himself, he will not take long in discovering the
truth. In fact, he will know immediately, on being told of the vision,
whether it is divine or comes from the imagination or the demon: more
especially if he has received the gift of discerning spirits--then, if
he is learned, he will understand the matter at once even though he has
not personally experienced the like.

10\. The great point is, sisters, that you should be perfectly candid
and straightforward with your confessor: I do not mean in declaring your
sins that is evident enough--but in giving him an account of your
prayer. <span id="fr_366"></span>[11](#fn_366.md) Unless you do this, I
cannot assure you of your safety nor that you are led by God. Our Lord
desires that we should be as truthful and open with those who stand in
His place as we should with Himself; that we should wish them to know
not only our thoughts but especially all relating to our actions,
however insignificant. Then you need feel no trouble nor anxiety <span
id="fr_367"></span>[12](#fn_367.md) because even if your vision were not
from God, it could do you no harm if you are humble and possess a good
conscience, for His Majesty knows how to glean good from evil. What the
devil intended to injure you will benefit you instead: believing that
God has granted you such signal favours, you will strive to please Him
better and will keep His image ever before your memory.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

11\. A great theologian <span id="fr_368"></span>[13](#fn_368.md) once said
that he should not trouble himself though the devil, who is a clever
painter, should present before his eyes the living image of Christ,
which would only kindle his devotion and defeat the evil one with his
own weapons. However wicked an artist may be, we should reverence his
picture if it represents Him Who is our only good. This great scholar
held that it was very wrong to advise any one who saw a vision of our
Lord to offer it signs of scorn, <span id="fr_369"></span>[14](#fn_369.md)
because we are bound to show respect to the portrait of our King
wherever we see it. I am sure that he was right, for even in the world
any one who was on friendly terms with a person would take it as an
offence were his portrait treated with contempt. How much more should we
always show respect to a crucifix or a picture of our heavenly Sovereign
wherever it meets our gaze! Although I have written about this
elsewhere, I am glad of the opportunity of saying it now for I know some
one who was deeply pained at being bidden to behave in this way. I know
not who can have invented such a torture for one who felt bound to obey
the counsel given by her confessor, for she would have thought her soul
was at stake had she disobeyed him. My advice is, if you are given such
an order, that humbly alleging the reasons I have set before you to your
confessor, you should not carry it out. I am perfectly satisfied with
the motives given for doing so by him who counselled me on this subject.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

12\. One great advantage gained by the soul from this favour shown by
our Lord is that when thinking of Him or of His life and Passion, the
remembrance of His most meek and beautiful face brings with it the
greatest consolation. In the same way, we feel happier after having seen
a benefactor than if we had never known him personally. I can assure you
that the remembrance of the joy caused by this vision gives us the
greatest comfort and assistance.

13\. Many other advantages result; but as I have written elsewhere <span
id="fr_370"></span>[15](#fn_370.md) at length about the effect these
visions produce, and must do so again later on, I will say no more now
lest I weary us both. But I most earnestly advise you, when you know or
hear of God's bestowing these graces on others, never to pray nor desire
to be led by this way yourself though it may appear to you to be very
good; indeed, it ought to be highly esteemed and reverenced, yet no one
should seek to go by it for several reasons. Firstly, as it is a want of
humility to desire what you have never deserved, I do not think any one
who longs for these graces can be really humble: a common labourer never
dreams of wishing to be made a king--the thing seems impossible and he
is unfit for it; a lowly mind has the same feeling about these divine
favours. I do not believe God will ever bestow these gifts on such a
person, as before doing so He always gives thorough self-knowledge. How
can that soul, while filled with such lofty aspirations, realize the
truth that He has shown it great mercy in not casting it into hell?

14\. The second reason is that such a one is certain

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

to be deceived or at least is in great danger of delusion, for an
entrance is thus left open to the devil, who only needs to see the door
left ajar to slip in at once and play us a thousand tricks.

15\. Thirdly: when people strongly desire a thing, the imagination makes
them fancy they see or hear it, just as when a man's mind is set upon a
subject all day he dreams of it at night.

16\. Fourthly: it would be very presumptuous of me to choose a way for
myself without knowing what is good for me. <span
id="fr_371"></span>[16](#fn_371.md) I should leave our Lord, Who knows my
soul, to guide me as is best for me so that His will may be done in all
things.

17\. Fifthly: do you think people on whom our Lord bestows these favours
have little to suffer? No, indeed! their trials are most severe and of
many kinds. How can you tell whether you would be able to bear them?

18\. Sixthly: perhaps what you think would be your gain might prove your
loss, as happened to Saul when he was made king. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[17](#fn_372.md) In short, sisters, there are other
reasons besides these; believe me, it is safer to wish only what God
wishes, Who knows us better than we know ourselves and Who loves us. Let
us place ourselves entirely in His hands so that His will may be done in
us; we can never go astray if our will is ever firmly fixed on this.

19\. Know that for having received many favours of this kind, you will
not merit more glory but will

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

be the more stringently obliged to serve, since you have received more.
God does not deprive us of anything by which we merit more, for this
remains in our own control. There are many saints who never knew what it
was to receive one such favour, while others who have received them are
not saints at all. Do not imagine that these gifts are continually
bestowed; indeed, for one that is granted, the soul bears many a cross,
so that instead of longing to receive more favours, it only strives to
use them better.

20\. True, such a grace is a most powerful aid towards practising the
virtues in their highest perfection, but it is far more meritorious to
gain them at the cost of one's own toil. I was acquainted with some
one, <span id="fr_373"></span>[18](#fn_373.md) indeed with two people (of
whom one was a man), on whom our Lord had bestowed some of these gifts.
They were both so desirous of serving His Majesty at their own cost
without these great consolations and so longed to suffer for His sake,
that they remonstrated with Him for giving them these favours, and if it
had been possible would have refused to receive them. When I say
'consolations,' I do not mean these visions which greatly benefit the
soul and are highly to be esteemed, but the delights given by God during
contemplation.

21\. I believe that these desires are supernatural and proper to very
fervent souls who wish to prove to God that they do not serve Him for
pay; so as I said, such people do not urge themselves to work

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

harder for Him by the thought of the glory they will gain, but rather
labour to satisfy their love, of which the nature is to toil for the
Beloved in a thousand ways. Such souls would fain find a way to consume
themselves in Him, and were there need that, for the sake of God's
greater glory, they should be annihilated for ever, they would count it
great gain. May He be for ever praised Who, in abasing Himself to hold
converse with us miserable creatures, vouchsafes to manifest His
greatness! Amen.
