# THE SECOND MANSIONS

### ONLY CHAPTER

TREATS OF THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF PERSEVERANCE IN ORDER TO ENTER THE
LAST MANSIONS, AND OF THE FIERCE WAR THE DEVIL WAGES AGAINST US. HOW
ESSENTIAL IT IS TO TAKE THE RIGHT PATH FROM THE VERY COMMENCEMENT OF OUR
JOURNEY. A METHOD OF ACTION WHICH HAS PROVED VERY EFFICACIOUS.

1\. Now let us consider which are the souls that enter the second
mansions, and what they do there: I do not wish to enlarge on this
subject, having already treated it very fully elsewhere, <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) for I could not avoid repeating myself, as
my memory is very bad. If I could state my ideas in another form they
would not weary you, for we never tire of reading books on this subject,
numerous as they are.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

2\. In this part of the castle are found souls which. have begun to
practise prayer; they realize the importance of their not remaining in
the first mansions, yet often lack determination to quit their present
condition by avoiding occasions of sin, which is a very perilous state
to be in.

3\. However, it is a great grace that they should sometimes make good
their escape from the vipers and poisonous creatures around them and
should understand the need of avoiding them. In some way these souls
suffer a great deal more than those in the first mansions, although not
in such danger, as they begin to understand their peril and there are
great hopes of their entering farther into the castle. I say that they
suffer a great deal more, for those in an earlier stage are like
deaf-mutes and are not so distressed at being unable to speak, while the
others, who can hear but cannot talk, find it much harder. At the same
time, it is better not to be deaf, and a decided advantage to hear what
is said to us.

4\. These souls hear our Lord calling them, for as they approach nearer
to where His Majesty dwells He proves a loving Neighbour, though they
may still be engaged in the amusements and business, the pleasures and
vanities of this world. While in this state we continually fall into sin
and rise again, for the creatures amongst whom we dwell are so venomous,
so vicious, and so dangerous, that it is almost impossible to avoid
being tripped up by them. Yet such are the pity and compassion of this
Lord of ours, so desirous is He that we should

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

seek Him and enjoy His company, that in one way or another He never
ceases calling us to Him. So sweet is His voice, that the poor soul is
disconsolate at being unable to follow His bidding at once, and
therefore, as I said, suffers more than if it could not hear Him.

5\. I do not mean that divine communications and inspirations received
in this mansion are the same as those I shall describe later on; God
here speaks to souls through words uttered by pious people, by sermons
or good books, and in many other such ways. Sometimes He calls souls by
means of sickness or troubles, or by some truth He teaches them during
prayer, for tepid as they may be in seeking Him, yet God holds them very
dear.

6\. Do not think lightly, sisters, of this first grace, nor be downcast
if you have not responded immediately to Our Lord's voice, for His
Majesty is willing to wait for us many a day and even many a year,
especially when He sees perseverance and good desires in our hearts.
Perseverance is the first essential; with this we are sure to profit
greatly. However, the devils now fiercely assault the soul in a thousand
different ways: it suffers more than ever, because formerly it was mute
and deaf, or at least could hear very little, and offered but feeble
resistance, like one who has almost lost all hope of victory.

7\. Here, however, the understanding being more vigilant and the powers
more on the alert, we cannot avoid hearing the fighting and cannonading
around us. For now the devils set on us the reptiles, that is to say,
thoughts about the world and its joys

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

which they picture as unending; they remind us of the high esteem men
held us in, of our friends and relations; they tell us how the penances
which souls in this mansion always begin to wish to perform would injure
our health: in fine, the evil spirits place a thousand impediments in
the way.

8\. O Jesus! What turmoil the devils cause in the poor soul! How unhappy
it feels, not knowing whether to go forward or to return to the first
mansion! On the other hand, reason shows it the delusion of overrating
worldly things, while faith teaches what alone can satisfy its cravings.
Memory reminds the soul how all earthly joys end, recalling the death of
those who lived at ease; how some died suddenly and were soon forgotten,
how others, once so prosperous, are now buried beneath the ground and
men pass by the graves where they lie, the prey of worms, <span
id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md) while the mind recalls many other such
incidents.

9\. The will inclines to love Our Lord and longs to make some return to
Him Who is so amiable, and Who has given so many proofs of His love,
especially by His constant presence with the soul, which this faithful
Lover never quits, ever accompanying it and giving it life and being.
The understanding

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

aids by showing that however many years life might last, no one could
ever wish for a better friend than God; that the world is full of
falsehood, and that the worldly pleasures pictured by the devil to the
mind were but troubles and cares and annoyances in disguise.

10\. Reason convinces the soul that as outside its interior castle are
found neither peace nor security, it should cease to seek another home
abroad, its own being full of riches that it can enjoy at will. Besides,
it is not every one who, like itself, possesses all he needs within his
own dwelling, and above all, such a Host, Who will give it all it can
desire, unless, like the prodigal son, it chooses to go astray and feed
with the swine. <span id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_65.md) Surely these
arguments are strong enough to defeat the devil's wiles! But, O my God,
how the force of worldly habits and the example of others who practise
them ruin everything! Our faith is so dead that we trust less to its
teaching than to what is visible, though, indeed, we see that worldly
lives bring nothing but unhappiness. All this results from those
venomous thoughts I described, which, unless we are very careful, will
deform the soul as the sting of a viper poisons and swells the body.

11\. When this happens, great care is evidently needed to cure it, and
only God's signal mercy prevents its resulting in death. Indeed, the
soul passes through severe trials at this time, especially when the
devil perceives from a person's character and behaviour that she is
likely to make very great

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

progress, for then all hell will league together to force her to turn
back. O my Lord! what need there is here that, by Thy mercy, Thou
shouldst prevent the soul from being deluded into forsaking the good
begun! Enlighten it to see that its welfare consists in perseverance in
the right way, and in the withdrawing from bad company.

12\. It is of the utmost importance for the beginner to associate with
those who lead a spiritual life, <span id="fr_66"></span>[4](#fn_66.md) and
not only with those in the same mansion as herself, but with others who
have travelled farther into the castle, who will aid her greatly and
draw her to join them. The soul should firmly resolve never to submit to
defeat, for if the devil sees it staunchly determined to lose life and
comfort and all that he can offer, rather than return to the first
mansion, he will the sooner leave it alone.

13\. Let the Christian be valiant; let him not be like those who lay
down to drink from the brook when they went to battle (I do not remember
when). <span id="fr_67"></span>[5](#fn_67.md) Let him resolve to go forth
to combat with the host of demons, and be convinced that there is no
better weapon than the cross. I have already said, <span
id="fr_68"></span>[6](#fn_68.md) yet it is of such importance that I repeat
it here: let no one think on starting of the reward to be reaped: this
would be a very ignoble way of commencing such a large and stately
building. If built on sand it would soon fall down. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[7](#fn_69.md) Souls

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

who acted thus would continually suffer from discouragement and
temptations, for in these mansions no manna rains; <span
id="fr_70"></span>[8](#fn_70.md) farther on, the soul is pleased with all
that comes, because it desires nothing but what God wills.

14\. What a farce it is! Here are we, with a thousand obstacles,
drawbacks, and imperfections within ourselves, our virtues so newly born
that they have scarcely the strength to act (and God grant that they
exist at all!) yet we are not ashamed to expect sweetness in prayer and
to complain of feeling dryness. <span id="fr_71"></span>[9](#fn_71.md)

15\. Do not act thus, sisters; embrace the cross your Spouse bore on His
shoulders; know that your motto should be: 'Most happy she who suffers
most if it be for Christ!' <span id="fr_72"></span>[10](#fn_72.md) All else
should be looked upon as secondary: if our Lord give it you, render Him
grateful thanks. You may imagine you would be resolute in enduring
external trials if God gave you interior consolations: His Majesty knows
best what is good for us; it is not for us to advise Him how to treat
us, for He has the right to tell us that we know not what we ask. <span
id="fr_73"></span>[11](#fn_73.md) Remember, it is of the greatest
importance--the sole aim of one beginning to practise prayer should be
to endure trials, and to resolve and strive to the utmost of her power
to conform her own will to the will of

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[12](#fn_74.md) Be certain that in this consists all the
greatest perfection to be attained in the spiritual life, as I will
explain later. She who practises this most perfectly will receive from
God the highest reward and is the farthest advanced on the right road.
Do not imagine that we have need of a cabalistic formula or any other
occult or mysterious thing to attain it our whole welfare consists in
doing the will of God. If we start with the false principle of wishing
God to follow our will and to lead us in the way we think best, upon
what firm foundation can this spiritual edifice rest?

16\. Let us endeavour to do our best: beware of the poisonous
reptiles--that is to say, the bad thoughts and aridities which are often
permitted by God to assail and torment us so that we cannot repel them.
Indeed, perchance we feel their sting! He allows this to teach us to be
more on our guard in the future and to see whether we grieve much at
offending Him. Therefore if you occasionally lapse into sin, do not lose
heart and cease trying to advance, for God will draw good even out of
our falls, like the merchant who sells theriac, who first takes poison,
then the theriac, to prove the power of his elixir. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[13](#fn_75.md) This combat would suffice to teach us to
amend our habits if we realized our failings in no other way, and would
show us the injury we receive from a life of dissipation. Can any evil
be greater than that we find at home? What peace can we hope to find
elsewhere, if we have none

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

within us? What friends or kindred can be so close and intimate as the
powers of our soul, which, whether we will or no, must ever bear us
company? These seem to wage war on us as if they knew the harm our vices
had wrought them. 'Peace, peace be unto you,' my sisters, as our Lord
said, and many a time proclaimed to His Apostles. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[14](#fn_76.md) Believe me, if we neither possess nor
strive to obtain this peace at home, we shall never find it abroad.

17\. By the blood which our Lord shed for us, I implore those who have
not yet begun to enter into themselves, to stop this warfare: I beg
those already started in the right path, not to let the combat turn them
back from it. Let them reflect that a relapse is worse than a fall, and
see what ruin it would bring. They should confide in God's mercy,
trusting nothing in themselves; then they will see how His Majesty will
lead them from one mansion to another, and will set them in a place
where these wild beasts can no more touch or annoy them, but will be
entirely at their mercy and merely objects of ridicule. Then, even in
this life, they will enjoy a far greater happiness than they are able
even to desire.

18\. As I said at the beginning of this work, I have explained
elsewhere <span id="fr_77"></span>[15](#fn_77.md) how you should behave
when the devil thus disturbs you. I also told you that the habit of
recollection is not to be gained by force of arms, but with calmness,
which will enable you to practise it for a longer space of time. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[16](#fn_78.md)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I will say no more
now, except that I think it very helpful for those of you who are
beginners to consult persons experienced in such matters, lest you
imagine that you are injuring yourselves by leaving your prayer to
perform any necessary duties. This is not the case; our Lord will direct
such things to our profit, although we may have no one to counsel
us. <span id="fr_79"></span>[17](#fn_79.md) The only remedy for having
given up a habit of recollection is to recommence it, otherwise the soul
will continue to lose it more and more every day, and God grant it may
realize its danger.

19\. You may think, that if it is so very injurious to desist, it would
have been better never to have begun, and to have remained outside the
castle. But, as I began by saying, and as God Himself declares: 'He that
loves danger shall perish by it,' <span id="fr_80"></span>[18](#fn_80.md)
and the door by which we must enter this castle is prayer. Remember, we
*must* get to heaven, and it would be madness to think we could do so
without sometimes retiring into our souls so as to know ourselves, or
thinking of our failings and of what we owe to God, or frequently
imploring His mercy. Our Lord also says, 'No man cometh to the Father
but by Me' <span id="fr_81"></span>[19](#fn_81.md) (I am not sure whether
this quotation is correct, but I think so), and, 'He that seeth Me seeth
the Father also.' <span id="fr_82"></span>[20](#fn_82.md)

20\. If we never look up at Him and reflect on what we owe Him for
having died for us, I do not understand how we can know Him, or perform

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

good deeds in His service. What value is there in faith without works?
and what are they worth if they are not united to the merits of Jesus
Christ, our only good? What would incite us to love our Lord unless we
thought of Him? May He give us grace to understand how much we cost Him;
that 'the servant is not above his lord' <span
id="fr_83"></span>[21](#fn_83.md); that we must toil for Him if we would
enjoy His glory; and prayer is a necessity to prevent us from constantly
falling into temptation. <span id="fr_84"></span>[22](#fn_84.md)
