# THE SEVENTH MANSIONS

### CHAPTER I.

TREATS OF THE SUBLIME FAVOURS GOD BESTOWS ON SOULS WHICH HAVE ENTERED
THE SEVENTH MANSIONS. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE SHE BELIEVES TO
EXIST BETWEEN SOUL AND SPIRIT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE BOTH ONE. THIS CHAPTER
CONTAINS SOME NOTEWORTHY THINGS.

*1. Sublime mysteries of these mansions. 2. St. Teresa abashed at
treating such subjects. 3. Our Lord introduces His bride into His
presence chamber. 4. Darkness of a soul in mortal sin. 5. Intercession
for sinners. 6. The soul an interior world. 7. The spiritual nuptials.
8. Former favours differ from spiritual nuptials. 9. The Blessed Trinity
revealed to the soul. 10. Permanence of Its presence in the soul. 11.
The effects. 12. This presence is not always equally realized. 13. It is
beyond the soul's control. 14. The centre of the soul remains calm. 15.
The soul and the spirit distinct though united. 16. The soul and its
faculties not identical*.

1\. You may think, sisters, that so much has been said of this spiritual
journey that nothing remains to be added. That would be a great mistake:
God's immensity has no limits, neither have His works; therefore, who
can recount His mercies and His greatness? <span
id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_391.md) It is impossible, so do not be amazed at
what I write about them which is but a cipher of what remains untold
concerning God. He has shown great mercy in communicating these
mysteries

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

to one who could recount them to us, for as we learn more of His
intercourse with creatures, we ought to praise Him more fervently and to
esteem more highly the soul in which He so delights. Each of us
possesses a soul but we do not realize its value as made in the image of
God, therefore we fail to understand the important secrets it contains.
May His Majesty be pleased to guide my pen and to teach me to say
somewhat of the *much* there is to tell of His revelations to the souls
He leads into this mansion. I have begged Him earnestly to help me,
since He sees that my object is to reveal His mercies for the praise and
glory of His name. I hope He will grant this favour, if not for my own
sake, at least for yours, sisters--so that you may discover how vital it
is for you to put no obstacle in the way of the Spiritual Marriage of
the Bridegroom with your soul which brings, as you will learn, such
signal blessings with it.

2\. O great God! surely such a miserable creature as myself should
tremble at the thought of speaking on such a subject so far beyond
anything I deserve to understand. Indeed I felt abashed and doubted
whether it would not be better to finish writing about this Mansion in a
few words, lest people might imagine that I am recounting my personal
experience. I was overwhelmed with shame for, knowing what I am, it is a
terrible undertaking. On the other hand, this fear seemed but a
temptation and weakness: even if I should be misjudged, so long as God
is but a little better praised and known, let all the world revile me.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Besides, I may be
dead before this book is seen; May He Who lives and shall live to all
eternity be praised! Amen.

3\. When our Lord is pleased to take pity on the sufferings, both past
and present, endured through her longing for Him by this soul which He
has spiritually taken for His bride, He, before consummating the
celestial marriage, brings her into this His mansion or presence
chamber. This is the seventh Mansion, for as He has a dwelling-place in
heaven, so has He in the soul, where none but He may abide and which may
be termed a second heaven.

4\. It is important, sisters, that we should not fancy the soul to be in
darkness. As we are accustomed to believe there is no light but that
which is exterior, we imagine that the soul is wrapt in obscurity. This
is indeed the case with a soul out of the state of grace, <span
id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_392.md) not, however, through any defer in the
Sun of Justice which remains within it and gives it being, but the soul
itself is incapable of receiving the light, as I think I said in
speaking of the first Mansion. <span id="fr_393"></span>[3](#fn_393.md) A
certain person was given to understand that such unfortunate souls are,
as it were, imprisoned in a gloomy dungeon, chained hand and foot and
unable to perform any meritorious action: they are also both blind and
dumb. Well may we pity them when we reflect that we ourselves were once
in the same state and that God may show them mercy also.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

5\. Let us, then, sisters, be most zealous in interceding for them and
never neglect it. To pray for a soul in mortal sin is a far more
profitable form of almsgiving than it would be to help a Christian whom
we saw with hands strongly fettered behind his back, tied to a post and
dying of hunger--not for want of food, because plenty of the choicest
delicacies lay near him, but because he was unable to put them into his
mouth, although he was extremely exhausted and on the point of dying,
and that not a temporal death, but an eternal one. Would it not be
extremely cruel of us to stand looking at him, and give him nothing to
eat? What if by your prayers you could loose his bonds? Now you
understand.

6\. For the love of God I implore you constantly to remember in your
prayers souls in a like case. We are not speaking now of them but of
others who, by the mercy of God, have done penance for their sins and
are in a state of grace. You must not think of the soul as insignificant
and petty but as an interior world containing the number of beautiful
mansions you have seen; as indeed it should, since in the centre of the
soul there is a mansion reserved for God Himself.

7\. When His Majesty deigns to bestow on the soul the grace of these
divine nuptials, He brings it into His presence chamber and does not
treat it as before, when He put it into a trance. I believe He then
united it to Himself, as also during the prayer of union; but then only
the superior part was affected and the soul did not feel called to

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

enter its own centre as it does in this mansion. Here it matters little
whether it is in the one way or the other.

8\. In the former favours our Lord unites the spirit to Himself and
makes it both blind and dumb like St. Paul after his conversion, <span
id="fr_394"></span>[4](#fn_394.md) thus preventing its knowing whence or
how it enjoys this grace, for the supreme delight of the spirit is to
realize its nearness to God. During the actual moment of divine union
the soul feels nothing, all its powers being entirely lost. But now He
acts differently: our pitiful God removes the scales from its eyes <span
id="fr_395"></span>[5](#fn_395.md) letting it see and understand somewhat
of the grace received in a strange and wonderful manner in this mansion
by means of intellectual vision.

9\. By some mysterious manifestation of the truth, the three Persons of
the most Blessed Trinity reveal themselves, preceded by an illumination
which shines on the spirit like a most dazzling cloud of light. <span
id="fr_396"></span>[6](#fn_396.md) The three Persons are distinct from one

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

another; a sublime knowledge is infused into the soul, imbuing it with a
certainty of the truth that the Three are of one substance, power, and
knowledge and are one God. Thus that which we hold as a doctrine of
faith, the soul now, so to speak, understands by sight, though it
beholds the Blessed Trinity neither by the eyes of the body nor of the
soul, this being no imaginary vision. All the Three Persons here
communicate Themselves to the soul, speak to it and make it understand
the words of our Lord in the Gospel that He and the Father and the Holy
Ghost will come and make their abode with the soul which loves Him and
keeps His commandments. <span id="fr_397"></span>[7](#fn_397.md)

10\. O my God, how different from merely hearing and believing these
words is it to realize their truth in this way! Day by day a growing
astonishment takes possession of this soul, for the three Persons of the
Blessed Trinity seem never to depart; it sees with certainty, in the way
I have described, that They dwell far within its own centre and depths;
though for want of learning it cannot describe how, it is conscious of
the indwelling of these divine Companions.

11\. You may fancy that such a person is beside herself and that her
mind is too inebriated to care for anything else. On the contrary, she
is far more

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

active than before in all that concerns God's service, and when at
leisure she enjoys this blessed companionship. Unless she first deserts
God, I believe He will never cease to make her clearly sensible of His
presence: she feels confident, as indeed she may, that He will never so
fail her as to allow her to lose this favour after once bestowing it; at
the same time, she is more careful than before to avoid offending Him in
any way.

12\. This presence is not always so entirely realized, that is, so
distinctly manifest, as at first, or as it is at times when God renews
this favour, otherwise the recipient could not possibly attend to
anything else nor live in society. Although not always seen by so clear
a light, yet whenever she reflects on it she feels the companionship of
the Blessed Trinity. This is as if, when we were with other people in a
very well lighted room, some one were to darken it by closing the
shutters; we should feel certain that the others were still there,
though we were unable to see them. <span id="fr_398"></span>[8](#fn_398.md)

13\. You may ask: 'Could she not bring back the light and see them
again?' <span id="fr_399"></span>[9](#fn_399.md) This is not in her

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

power; when our Lord chooses, He will open the shutters of the
understanding: He shows her great mercy in never quitting her and in
making her realize it so clearly. His divine Majesty seems to be
preparing His bride for greater things by this divine companionship
which clearly helps perfection in every way and makes her lose the fear
she sometimes felt when other graces were granted her.

14\. A certain person so favoured found she had improved in all virtues:
whatever were her trials or labours, the centre of her soul seemed never
moved from its resting-place. Thus in a manner her soul appeared
divided: a short time after God had done her this favour, while
undergoing great sufferings, she complained of her soul as Martha did of
Mary, <span id="fr_400"></span>[10](#fn_400.md) reproaching it with
enjoying solitary peace while leaving her so full of troubles and
occupations that she could not keep it company.

15\. This may seem extravagant to you, daughters, yet though the soul is
known to be undivided, it is fact and no fancy and often happens.
Interior effects show for certain that there is a positive difference
between the soul and the spirit, although they are one with each
other. <span id="fr_401"></span>[11](#fn_401.md) There is an extremely

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

subtle distinction between them, so that sometimes they seem to at in a
different manner from one another, as does the knowledge given to them
by God.

16\. It also appears to me that the soul and its faculties are not
identical. There are so many and such transcendental mysteries within
us, that it would be presumption for me to attempt to explain them. If
by God's mercy we enter heaven we shall understand these secrets.

'While the holy Mother lived at the convent of the Incarnation of Avila
\[as prioress\], I often spoke with her, and once I remember she asked
me: "What am I to do, Father? Whenever I recollect myself I realize that
already in this life the Three Persons of the Blessed Trinity may be
seen, and that They accompany me and assist me in the management of my
affairs."' (Fuente, *Obras*, vol. vi. p. 280.)

'Doña Maria Enriquez, Duchess of Alva, said that St. Teresa made known
to her many revelations she had received from our Lord, and that she
(the duchess) held in her possession three paintings of the <span
id="page_266">p. 266</span> Blessed Trinity made according to the
description of the holy Mother, who, while they were being done, effaced
with her own hand those portions which the painter failed to design

<span id="fn_399"></span>[267:9](tic29.htm#fr_399.md) 'Though the soul be
always in the high estate of marriage since God has placed it there,
nevertheless, actual union in all its powers is not continuous, though
the substantial union is. In this substantial union the powers of the
soul are most frequently in union, and drink of His cellar, the
understanding by knowledge, the will by love, etc. We are not therefore
to suppose that the soul, when saying it went out, has ceased from its
substantial or essential union with God, but only from the union of its
faculties, which is not, and cannot be, permanent in this life.' (St.
John of the Cross, *Spiritual Canticle*, stanza xxvi. 9. On the words:
'In the inner cellar of my Beloved have I drunk, and when I went
forth').

4. The distinction between soul and spirit, to be found in the Epistle
to the Hebrews, iv. 12, according to Cornelius a Lapide (*ad loc*.)
consists in this, that the term *soul* comprises the faculties, senses,
and passions, whereas the term *spirit* denotes the substance of the
soul independently of its powers. In the inferior degrees of the
Mystical life God operates through the faculties, while in the Mystical
marriage He acts directly on the substance of the soul. St. Teresa is
not quite <span id="page_269">p. 269</span> consistent in the use of
these terms, which is not surprising, as she owns that she does not
quite understand this subtle distinction.
