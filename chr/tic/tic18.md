### CHAPTER II.

TREATS OF SEVERAL WAYS WHEREBY OUR LORD QUICKENS THE SOUL; THERE APPEARS
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM IN THEM ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SIGNAL FAVOURS OF A VERY
EXALTED NATURE.

*1. Our Lord excites the love of His spouse. 2. The wound of love. 3.
The pain it causes. 4. The call of the Bridegroom. 5. Effect on the
soul. 6. A spark of the fire of love. 7. The spark dies out. 8. This
grace evidently divine. 9. One such wound repays many trials. 10. First
reason of immunity from deception. 11. Second and third reasons. 12. The
imagination not concerned in it. 13. St. Teresa never alarmed at this
prayer. 14. 'The odour of Thine ointment.' 15. No reason to fear
deception here*.

1\. IT seems as if we had deserted the little dove for a long time, but
this is not the case, for these past trials cause her to take a far
higher flight. I will now describe the way in which the Spouse treats
her before uniting her entirely to Himself. He increases her longing for
Him by devices so delicate that the soul itself cannot discern them; nor
do I think I could explain them except to people who have personally
experienced them. These desires are delicate and subtle impulses
springing from the inmost depths of the soul; I know of nothing to which
they can be compared.

2\. These graces differ entirely from anything we ourselves can gain,
and even from the spiritual consolation before described. <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_227.md) In the present case, even when the mind
is not recollected or even thinking of God, although no sound is heard,
His

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Majesty arouses it
suddenly as if by a swiftly flashing comet or by a clap of
thunder. <span id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_228.md) Yet the soul thus called
by God hears Him well enough--so well, indeed, that sometimes,
especially at first, it trembles and even cries out, although it feels
no pain. It is conscious of having received a delicious wound but cannot
discover how, nor who gave it, yet recognizes it as a most precious
grace and hopes the hurt will never heal.

3\. The soul makes amorous complaints to its Bridegroom, even uttering
them aloud; nor can it control itself, knowing that though He is present
He will not manifest Himself so that it may enjoy Him. This causes a
pain, keen although sweet and delicious from which the soul could not
escape even if it wished; but this it never desires. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_229.md) This favour is more delightful than the
pleasing absorption of the faculties in the prayer of quiet which is
unaccompanied by suffering. <span id="fr_230"></span>[4](#fn_230.md)

4\. I am at my wits' end, sisters, as to how to make you understand this
operation of love: I know not how to do so. It seems contradictory to
say that the Beloved clearly shows He dwells in the soul and calls by so
unmistakable a sign and a summons so penetrating, that the spirit cannot
choose but hear it, while He appears to reside in the seventh mansion.
He speaks in this manner, which is not a set form of speech, and the
inhabitants of the other

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

mansions, the senses, the imagination and the faculties, dare not
stir. <span id="fr_231"></span>[5](#fn_231.md)

5\. O Almighty God! how profound are Thy [secrets](errata.htm#3.md) and how
different are spiritual matters from anything that can be seen or heard
in this world! I can find nothing to which to liken these graces,
insignificant as they are compared with many others Thou dost bestow on
souls. This favour acts so strongly upon the spirit that it is consumed
by desires yet knows not what to ask, for it realizes clearly that its
God is with it. You may inquire, if it realizes this so clearly, what
more does it desire and why is it pained? What greater good can it seek?
I cannot tell: I know that this suffering seems to pierce the very
heart, and when He Who wounded it draws out the dart He seems to draw
the heart out too, so deep is the love it feels. <span
id="fr_232"></span>[6](#fn_232.md)

6\. I have been thinking that God might be likened to a burning
furnace <span id="fr_233"></span>[7](#fn_233.md) from which a small spark
flies into the soul that feels the heat of this great fire, which,
however, is insufficient to consume it. The sensation is so delightful
that the spirit lingers in the pain produced by its contact. This seems
to me the best comparison I can find, for the pain is delicious and is
not really pain at all, nor does it always continue in the same degree;
sometimes it lasts for a long time; on other occasions it passes
quickly. This is as God chooses, for no human means can obtain it; and
though felt at times for a long while, yet it is intermittent.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

7\. In fact it is never permanent and therefore does not wholly inflame
the spirit; but when the soul is ready to take fire, the little spark
suddenly dies out, leaving the heart longing to suffer anew its loving
pangs. No grounds exist for thinking this comes from any natural cause
or from melancholy, or that it is an illusion of the devil or the
imagination. Undoubtedly this movement of the heart comes from God Who
is unchangeable; nor do its effects is resemble those of other devotions
in which the strong absorption of delight makes us doubt their reality.

8\. There is no suspension here of the senses or other faculties: they
wonder at what is happening, without impeding it. Nor do I think that
they can either increase or dispel this delightful pain. Any one who has
received this favour from our Lord will understand my meaning on reading
this: let her thank Him fervently: there is no need to fear deception
but far more fear of not being sufficiently grateful for so signal a
grace. Let her endeavour to serve Him and to amend her life in every
respect; then she will see what will follow and how she will obtain
still higher and higher gifts.

9\. A person on whom this grace was bestowed passed several years
without receiving any other favour, yet was perfectly satisfied, for
even had she served God for very many years in the midst of severe
trials, she would have felt abundantly repaid. May He be for ever
blessed! Amen.

10\. Perhaps you wonder why we may feel more secure against deception
concerning this favour

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

than in other cases. I think it is for these reasons. Firstly, because
the devil cannot give such delicious pain: he may cause pleasure or
delight which appears spiritual but is unable to add suffering,
especially suffering of so keen a sort, united to peace and joy of soul.
His power is limited to what is external; suffering produced by him is
never accompanied with peace, but with anxieties and struggles.

11\. Secondly, because this welcome storm comes from no region over
which Satan has control. Thirdly, because of the great benefits left in
the soul which, as a rule, is resolute to suffer for God and longs to
bear many crosses. It is also far more determined than before to
withdraw from worldly pleasures and intercourse and other things of the
same sort.

12\. It is very clear that this is no fiction: the imagination may
counterfeit some favours but not this, which is too manifest to leave
room for doubt. Should any one still remain uncertain, let her know that
hers were not genuine impulses; <span id="fr_234"></span>[8](#fn_234.md)
that is, if she is dubious as to whether or no she experienced them, for
they are as certainly perceived by the soul as is a loud voice by the
ears. It is impossible for these experiences to proceed from melancholy
whose whims arise and exist only in the imagination, whereas this
emotion comes from the interior of the soul.

13\. I may be mistaken, but I shall not change my opinion until I hear
reasons to the contrary from

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

those who understand these matters. I know some one who has always
greatly dreaded such deceptions, yet could never bring herself to feel
any alarm about this state of prayer. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[9](#fn_235.md)

14\. Our Lord also uses other means of rousing the soul; for
instance--when reciting vocal prayer without seeking to penetrate the
sense, a person may be seized with a delightful fervour <span
id="fr_236"></span>[10](#fn_236.md) as if suddenly encompassed with a
fragrance powerful enough to diffuse itself through all the senses. I do
not assert that there really is any perfume but use this comparison
because it somewhat resembles the manner by which the Spouse makes His
presence understood, moving the soul to a delicious desire of enjoying
Him and thus disposing it to heroic acts, and causing it to render Him
fervent praise.

15\. This favour springs from the same source as the former, but causes
no suffering here, nor are the soul's longings to enjoy God painful:
this is what is more usually experienced by the soul. For the reasons
already given there appears no cause here for fear, but rather for
receiving it with thanksgiving.
