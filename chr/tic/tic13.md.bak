# THE FIFTH MANSIONS

### CHAPTER I.

BEGINS TO TREAT OF THE UNION OF THE SOUL WITH GOD IN PRAYER. HOW TO BE
SURE THAT WE ARE NOT DECEIVED IN THIS MATTER.

*1. Graces of the fifth mansions. 2. Contemplation to be striven for. 3.
Physical effects of the Prayer of union. 4. Amazement of the intellect.
5. The Prayer of union and of quiet contrasted. 6. Divine and earthly
union. 7. Competent directors in these matters. 8. Proof of union. 9.
Assurance left in the soul. 10. Divine union beyond our Power to
obtain*.

1\. OH, my sisters, how shall I describe the riches, treasures, and joys
contained in the fifth mansions! Would it not be better to say nothing
about them? They are impossible to depict, nor can the mind conceive,
nor any comparisons portray them, all earthly things being too vile to
serve the purpose. Send me, O my Lord, light from heaven that I may give
some to these Thy servants, some of whom by Thy good will often enjoy
these delights, lest the devil in the guise of an angel of light should
deceive those whose only desire is to please Thee.

2\. I said 'some,' but in reality there are very *few* <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md) who never enter this mansion: some more
and some less, but most of them may be said at least

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

to gain admittance into these rooms. I think that certain graces I am
about to describe are bestowed on only a few of the nuns, but if the
rest only arrive at the portal they receive a great boon from God, for
'many are called, but few are chosen.' <span
id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_154.md) All we who wear the holy habit of the
Carmelites are called to prayer and contemplation. This was the object
of our Order, <span id="fr_155"></span>[3](#fn_155.md) to this lineage we
belong. Our holy Fathers of Mount Carmel sought in perfect solitude and
utter contempt of the world for this treasure, this precious
pearl, <span id="fr_156"></span>[4](#fn_156.md) of which we speak, and we
are their descendants. How little do most of us care to prepare our
souls, that our Lord may reveal this jewel to us! Outwardly we may
appear to practise the requisite virtues, but we have far more to do
than this before it is possible to attain to contemplation, to gain
which we should neglect no means, either small or great. Rouse
yourselves, my sisters, and since some foretaste of heaven may be had on
earth, beg our Lord to give us grace not to miss it through our own
fault. Ask Him to show us where to find it--ask Him to give us strength
of soul to dig until we find this hidden treasure, which lies buried
within our hearts, as I wish to show you if it please God to enable me.
I said 'strength of *soul*,' that you might understand that strength of
*body* is not indispensable when our Lord God chooses to withhold it. He
makes it impossible for no one to gain these riches,

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

but is content that each should do his best. Blessed be so just a God!

3\. But, daughters, if you would purchase this treasure of which we are
speaking, God would have you keep back nothing from Him, little or
great. He will have it all; <span id="fr_157"></span>[5](#fn_157.md) in
proportion to what you know you have given will your reward be great or
small. There is no more certain sign whether or not we have reached the
prayer of union. Do not imagine that this state of prayer is, like the
one preceding it, a sort of drowsiness (I call it 'drowsiness' because
the soul seems to slumber, being neither quite asleep nor wholly awake).
In the prayer of union the soul is asleep, fast asleep, as regards the
world and itself: in fact, during the short time this state lasts it is
deprived of all feeling whatever, being unable to think on any subject,
even if it wished. No effort is needed here to suspend the thoughts: if
the soul can love it knows not how, nor whom it loves, nor what it
desires. In fact, it has died entirely to this world, to live more truly
than ever in God. This is a delicious death, for the soul is deprived of
the faculties it exercised while in the body: <span
id="fr_158"></span>[6](#fn_158.md) delicious because, (although not really
the case), it seems to have left its mortal covering to abide more
entirely in God. So completely does this take place, that I know not
whether the body retains sufficient life to continue breathing; on

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

consideration, I believe it does not; at any rate, if it still breathes,
it does so unconsciously.

4\. The mind entirely concentrates itself on trying to understand what
is happening, which is beyond its power; it is so astounded that, if
consciousness is not completely lost, at least no movement is possible:
the person may be compared to one who falls into a dead faint with
dismay. <span id="fr_159"></span>[7](#fn_159.md)

5\. Oh, mighty secrets of God! Never should I weary of trying to explain
them if I thought it possible to succeed! I would write a thousand
foolish things that one might be to the point, if only it might make us
praise God more. I said this prayer produced no drowsiness in the mind;
on the other hand, in the prayer (of quiet) described in the last
mansion, until the soul has gained much experience it doubts what really
happened to it. 'Was it nothing but fancy, or was it a sleep? Did it
come from God or from the devil, disguised as an angel of light?' The
mind feels a thousand misgivings, and well for it that it should,
because, at I said, nature may sometimes deceive us in this case.
Although there is little chance of the poisonous reptiles entering here,
yet agile little lizards will try to slip in, though they can do no
harm, especially if they remain unnoticed. These, as I said, are trivial
fancies of the imagination, which are often very troublesome. However
active these small lizards may be, they cannot enter the fifth mansion,
for neither the imagination, the understanding, nor the memory has power
to hinder the graces bestowed on it.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

6\. I dare venture to assert that, if this is genuine union with God,
the devil cannot interfere nor do any harm, for His Majesty is so joined
and united with the essence of the soul, that the evil one dare not
approach, nor can he even understand this mystery. This is certain, for
it is said that the devil does not know our thoughts, much less can he
penetrate a secret so profound that God does not reveal it even to
us. <span id="fr_160"></span>[8](#fn_160.md) Oh, blessed state, in which
this cursed one cannot injure us! What riches we receive while God so
works in us that neither we ourselves nor any one else can impede Him!
What will He not bestow, Who is so eager to give, and Who can give us
all He desires! You may perhaps have been puzzled at my saying 'if this
is genuine union with God,' as if there might be other unions. There are
indeed--not with God, but with vanities--when the devil transports the
soul passionately addicted to them, but the union differs from that
which is divine and the mind misses the delight and satisfaction, peace
and happiness of divine union. These heavenly consolations are above all
earthly joys, pleasure, and satisfaction. As great a difference exists
between their origin and that of worldly pleasures as between their
opposite effects, as you know by experience.

7\. I said somewhere <span id="fr_161"></span>[9](#fn_161.md) that the one
seems only to touch the surface of the body, while the other penetrates
to the very marrow: I believe this is

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

correct, and I cannot express myself better. I fancy that you are not
yet satisfied on this question, but are afraid of deception, for
spiritual matters are very hard to explain. Enough, however, has been
said for those who have received this grace, as the difference between
divine union and any other is very striking. However, I will give you a
clear proof which cannot mislead you, nor leave any doubt whether the
favour comes from God or no. His Majesty brought it back to my memory
this very day; it appears to me to be an unmistakable sign. In difficult
questions, although I think I understand them and am speaking the truth,
I always say 'it appears to me'; for, in case my opinion is wrong, I am
most willing to submit to the judgment of theologians. Although they may
not have had personal experience in such matters, yet in some way I do
not understand, God Who sets them to give light to His Church enables
them to recognize the truth when it is put before them. If they are not
thoughtless and indevout, but servants of God, they are never dismayed
at His mighty works, knowing perfectly well that it is in His power to
perform far greater wonders. If some of the marvels told are new to
them, yet they have read of others of the same kind, showing the former
to be possible. I have had great experience as to this and have also met
with timid, half-instructed people whose ignorance has cost me very
dear. <span id="fr_162"></span>[10](#fn_162.md) I am convinced that those
who refuse to believe that God can do far more than this, and that He is
pleased now, as in the past, to communicate

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Himself to His
creatures, shut fast their hearts against receiving such favours
themselves. Do not imitate them, sisters: be convinced that it is
possible for God to perform still greater wonders. Do not concern
yourselves as to whether those who receive these graces are good or
wicked; as I said, He knows best and it is no business of yours: you
should serve Him with a single heart and with humility, and should
praise Him for His works and wonders. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[11](#fn_163.md)

8\. Let us now speak of the sign which proves the prayer of union to
have been genuine. As you have seen, God then deprives the soul of all
its senses that He may the better imprint in it true wisdom: it neither
sees, hears, nor understands anything while this state lasts, which is
never more than a very brief time; <span
id="fr_164"></span>[12](#fn_164.md) it appears to the soul to be much
shorter than it really is. God visits the soul in a manner which
prevents its doubting, on returning to itself, that it dwelt in Him and
that He was within it, and so firmly is it convinced of this truth that,
although years may pass before this favour recurs, the soul can never
forget it nor doubt the fact, <span id="fr_165"></span>[13](#fn_165.md)
setting aside the effects left by this prayer, to which I will refer
later on. The conviction felt by the soul is the main point.

9\. But, you may ask, how can a person who is incapable of sight and
hearing see <span id="fr_166"></span>[14](#fn_166.md) or know these

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

things? I do not say that she saw it at the time, but that she perceives
it clearly afterwards, not by any vision but by a certitude which
remains in the heart which God alone could give. I know of some one who
was unaware of God's being in all things by presence, power and essence,
yet was firmly convinced of it by a divine favour of this sort. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[15](#fn_167.md) She asked an ill-instructed priest of
the kind I mentioned to tell her in what way God dwelt within us: he was
as ignorant on the subject as she had been before our Lord revealed to
her the truth, and answered that the Almighty was only present in us by
grace. <span id="fr_168"></span>[16](#fn_168.md) Yet so strong was her

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

conviction of the truth learnt during her prayer that she did not
believe him and questioned other spiritual persons on the subject, who
confirmed her in the true doctrine, much to her joy. Do not mistake and
imagine that this certainty of God's having visited the soul concerns
any corporal presence such as that of our Lord Jesus Christ Who dwells
in the Blessed Sacrament, although we do not see Him: it relates solely
to the Divinity. If we did not see it, how can we feel so sure of it?
That I do not know: it is the work of the Almighty and I am certain that
what I say is the fact. I maintain that a soul which does not feel this
assurance has not been united to God entirely, but only by one of its
powers, or has received one of the many other favours God is accustomed
to bestow on men. In all such matters we must not seek to know how
things happened: our understanding could not grasp them, therefore why
trouble ourselves on the subject? It is enough to know that it is He,
the all-powerful God, Who has performed the work. We can do nothing on
our own part to gain this favour; it comes from God alone; therefore let
us not strive to understand it.

10\. Concerning my words: 'We can do nothing on our own part,' I was
struck by the words of the Bride in the Canticles, which you will
remember to have heard: 'The King brought me into the cellar of
wine,' <span id="fr_169"></span>[17](#fn_169.md) (or 'placed me' I think
she says): she does not say she went of her own accord,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

although telling us how she wandered up and down seeking her
Beloved. <span id="fr_170"></span>[18](#fn_170.md) I think the prayer of
union is the 'cellar' in which our Lord places us when and how He
chooses, but we cannot enter it through any effort of our own. His
Majesty alone can bring us there and come into the centre of our souls.
In order to declare His wondrous works more clearly, He will leave us no
share in them except complete conformity of our wills to His and
abandonment of all things: He does not require the faculties or senses
to open the door to Him; they are all asleep. He enters the innermost
depths of our souls without a door, as He entered the room where the
disciples sat, saying 'Pax vobis,' <span
id="fr_171"></span>[19](#fn_171.md) and as He emerged from the sepulchre
without removing the stone that closed the entrance. You will see
farther on, in the seventh mansion, far better than here, how God makes
the soul enjoy His presence in its very centre. O daughters, what
wonders shall we see, if we keep ever before our eyes our own baseness
and frailty and recognize how unworthy we are to be the handmaids of so
great a Lord, Whose marvels are beyond our comprehension! May He be for
ever praised! Amen.

ways in which God is present in the soul. The first is His presence in
essence, not in holy souls only, but in wretched and sinful souls as
well, and also in all created things; for it is by this presence that He
gives life and being, and were it withdrawn at once all things would
return to nothing. This presence never fails in the soul. The second is
His presence by grace, whereby He dwells in the soul, pleased and
satisfied with it. This presence is not in all souls; for those who fall
into mortal sin lose it, and no soul can know in a natural way whether
it has it or not. The third is His presence by spiritual affection. God
is wont to show His presence in many devout souls in divers ways, in
refreshment, joy and gladness.' (St. John of the Cross, *Spiritual
Canticle*, stanza xi. 2.)

'In every soul, even that of the greatest sinner in the world, God
dwells and is substantially present. This way of union or presence of
God, in the order of nature, subsists between Him and all His creatures;
by this He preserves them in being, and if He withdraws it they
immediately perish and cease to be. And so, when I speak of the union of
the soul with God, I do not mean this substantial presence which is in
every creature, but that union and transformation of the soul in God by
love which is only then accomplished when there subsists the likeness
which love begets.' (St. John of the Cross, *Ascent*, bk. ii. ch. v. 3.)
