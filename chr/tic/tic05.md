# THE FIRST MANSIONS

### CHAPTER I.

THIS CHAPTER TREATS OF THE BEAUTY AND DIGNITY OF OUR SOULS AND MAKES A
COMPARISON TO EXPLAIN THIS. THE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING
THIS AND THE FAVOURS GOD GRANTS TO US IS SHOWN, AND HOW PRAYER IS THE
GATE OF THE SPIRITUAL CASTLE.

*1. Plan of this book. 2. The Interior Castle. 3. Our curable self
ignorance. 4. God dwells in the centre of the soul. 5. Why all souls do
not receive certain favours. 6. Reasons for speaking of these favours.
7. The entrance of the Castle. 8. Entering into oneself. 9. Prayer. 10.
Those who dwell in the first mansion. 11. Entering. 12. Difficulties of
the subject*.

1\. WHILE I was begging our Lord to-day to speak for me, since I knew
not what to say nor how to commence this work which obedience has laid
upon me, an idea occurred to me which I will explain, and which will
serve as a foundation for that I am about to write.

2\. I thought of the soul as resembling a castle, <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) formed of a single diamond or a very
transparent crystal, <span id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31.md) and containing
many rooms, just as in

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

heaven there are many mansions. <span id="fr_32"></span>[3](#fn_32.md) If
we reflect, sisters, we shall see that the soul of the just man is but a
paradise, in which, God tells us, He takes His delight. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[4](#fn_33.md) What, do you imagine, must that dwelling
be in which a King so mighty, so wise, and so pure, containing in
Himself all good, can delight to rest? Nothing can be compared to the
great beauty and capabilities of a soul; however keen our intellects may
be, they are as unable to comprehend them as to comprehend God, for, as
He has told us, He created us in His own image and likeness. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[5](#fn_34.md)

3\. As this is so, we need not tire ourselves by trying to realize all
the beauty of this castle, although, being His creature, there is all
the difference between the soul and God that there is between the
creature and the Creator; the fact that it is made in God's image
teaches us how great are its dignity and loveliness. It is no small
misfortune and disgrace that, through our own fault, we neither
understand our nature nor our origin. Would it not be gross ignorance,
my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or country,
or parents, he could not answer? Stupid as this would be, it is
unspeakably more foolish to care to learn

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

nothing of our nature except that we possess bodies, and only to realize
vaguely that we have souls, because people say so and it is a doctrine
of faith. Rarely do we reflect upon what gifts our souls may possess,
Who dwells within them, or how extremely precious they are. Therefore we
do little to preserve their beauty; all our care is concentrated on our
bodies, which are but the coarse setting of the diamond, or the outer
walls of the castle. <span id="fr_35"></span>[6](#fn_35.md)

4\. Let us imagine, as I said, that there are many rooms in this castle,
of which some are above, some below, others at the side; in the centre,
in the very midst of them all, is the principal chamber in which God and
the soul hold their most secret intercourse. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[7](#fn_36.md) Think over this comparison very carefully;
God grant it may enlighten you about the different kinds of graces He is
pleased to bestow upon the soul. No one can know all about them, much
less a person so ignorant as I am. The knowledge that such things are
possible will console you greatly should our Lord ever grant you

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

any of these favours; people themselves deprived of them can then at
least praise Him for His great goodness in bestowing them on others. The
thought of heaven and the happiness of the saints does us no harm, but
cheers and urges us to win this joy for ourselves, nor will it injure us
to know that during this exile God can communicate Himself to us
loathsome worms; it will rather make us love Him for such immense
goodness and infinite mercy.

5\. I feel sure that vexation at thinking that during our life on earth
God can bestow these graces on the souls of others shows a want of
humility and charity for one's neighbour, for why should we not feel
glad at a brother's receiving divine favours which do not deprive us of
our own share? Should we not rather rejoice at His Majesty's thus
manifesting His greatness wherever He chooses? <span
id="fr_37"></span>[8](#fn_37.md) Sometimes our Lord acts thus solely for
the sake of showing His power, as He declared when the Apostles
questioned whether the blind man whom He cured had been suffering for
his own or his parents' sins. <span id="fr_38"></span>[9](#fn_38.md) God
does not bestow these favours on certain souls because they are more
holy than others who do not receive them, but to manifest His greatness,
as in the case of St. Paul and St. Mary Magdalen, and that we may
glorify Him in His creatures.

6\. People may say such things appear impossible and it is best not to
scandalize the weak in faith by

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

speaking about them. But it is better that the latter should disbelieve
us, than that we should desist from enlightening souls which receive
these graces, that they may rejoice and may endeavour to love God better
for His favours, seeing He is so mighty and so great. There is no danger
here of shocking those for whom I write by treating of such matters, for
they know and believe that God gives even greater proofs of His love. I
am certain that if any one of you doubts the truth of this, God will
never allow her to learn it by experience, for He desires that no limits
should be set to His work: therefore, never discredit them because you
are not thus led yourselves.

7\. Now let us return to our beautiful and charming castle and discover
how to enter it. This appears incongruous: if this castle is the soul,
clearly no one can have to enter it, for it is the person himself: one
might as well tell some one to go into a room he is already in! There
are, however, very different ways of being in this castle; many souls
live in the courtyard of the building where the sentinels stand, neither
caring to enter farther, nor to know who dwells in that most delightful
place, what is in it and what rooms it contains.

8\. Certain books on prayer that you have read advise the soul to enter
into itself, <span id="fr_39"></span>[10](#fn_39.md) and this is what I
mean. I was recently told by a great theologian that souls without
prayer are like bodies, palsied and lame, having hands and feet they
cannot use.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Just so, there are
souls so infirm and accustomed to think of nothing but earthly matters,
that there seems no cure for them. It appears impossible for them to
retire into their own hearts; accustomed as they are to be with the
reptiles and other creatures which live outside the castle, they have
come at last to imitate their habits. Though these souls are by their
nature so richly endowed, capable of communion even with God Himself,
yet their case seems hopeless. Unless they endeavour to understand and
remedy their most miserable plight, their minds will become, as it were,
bereft of movement, just as Lot's wife became a pillar of salt for
looking backwards in disobedience to God's command. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[11](#fn_40.md)

9\. As far as I can understand, the gate by which to enter this castle
is prayer and meditation. I do not allude more to mental than to vocal
prayer, for if it is prayer at all, the mind must take part in it. If a
person neither considers to Whom he is addressing himself, what he asks,
nor what he is who ventures to speak to God, although his lips may utter
many words, I do not call it prayer. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[12](#fn_41.md) Sometimes, indeed, one may pray devoutly
without making all these considerations through having practised them at
other times. The custom of speaking to God Almighty as freely as with a
slave--caring nothing whether the words are suitable or not, but simply
saying the first thing that comes to mind from being learnt by rote by
frequent repetition--cannot be called prayer: God grant that

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

no [Christian](errata.htm#1.md) may address Him in this manner. I trust His
Majesty will prevent any of you, sisters, from doing so. Our habit in
this Order of conversing about spiritual matters is a good preservative
against such evil ways.

10\. Let us speak no more of these crippled souls, who are in a most
miserable and dangerous state, unless our Lord bid them rise, as He did
the palsied man who had waited more than thirty years at the pool of
Bethsaida. <span id="fr_42"></span>[13](#fn_42.md) We will now think of the
others who at last enter the precincts of the castle; they are still
very worldly, yet have some desire to do right, and at times, though
rarely, commend themselves to God's care. They think about their souls
every now and then; although very busy, they pray a few times a month,
with minds generally filled with a thousand other matters, for where
their treasure is, there is their heart also. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[14](#fn_43.md) Still, occasionally they cast aside these
cares; it is a great boon for them to realize to some extent the state
of their souls, and to see that they will never reach the gate by the
road they are following.

11\. At length they enter the first rooms in the basement of the castle,
accompanied by numerous reptiles <span id="fr_44"></span>[15](#fn_44.md)
which disturb their peace, and prevent their seeing the beauty of the
building; still, it is a great gain that these persons should have found
their way in at all.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

12\. You may think, my daughters, that all this does not concern you,
because, by God's grace, you are farther advanced; still, you must be
patient with me, for I can explain myself on some spiritual matters
concerning prayer in no other way. May our Lord enable me to speak to
the point; the subject is most difficult to understand without personal
experience of such graces. Any one who has received them will know how
impossible it is to avoid touching on subjects which, by the mercy of
God, will never apply to us.

combat, it shall then pass on to the second; and if it shall be
victorious there also, it shall then pass on to the third; and then
through the seven mansions, the seven degrees of love, until the
Bridegroom shall bring it to the "cellar of wine" of perfect charity.'

<span id="fn_36"></span>[40:7](tic05.htm#fr_36.md) St. John of the Cross on
the words of his stanza: 'In the inner cellar of my Beloved have I
drunk.' 'Here the soul speaks of that sovereign grace of God in taking
it into the house of His love, which is the union or transformation of
love in God . . . The cellar is the highest degree of love to which the
soul can attain in this life, and is therefore said to be the inner. It
follows from this that there are other cellars not so interior; that is,
the degrees of love by which souls reach to this, the last. These
cellars are seven in number, and the soul has entered them all when it
has in perfection the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, so far as it is
possible for it. . . . Many souls reach and enter the first cellar, each
according to the perfection of its love, but the last and inmost cellar
is entered by few in this world, because therein is wrought the perfect
union with God, the union of the spiritual marriage.' *A Spiritual
Canticle*, stanza xxvi. 1-3. Concept. ch. vi. (*Minor Works of St.
Teresa*.)

was provided with a bear-garden where rare animals were kept for the
amusement of the inhabitants. This may have supplied the material for
St. Teresa's comparison.
