### CHAPTER III.

TREATS OF THE SAME SUBJECT AND OF THE WAY GOD IS SOMETIMES PLEASED TO
SPEAK TO THE SOUL. HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE IN SUCH A CASE, IN WHICH WE MUST
NOT FOLLOW OUR OWN OPINION. GIVES SIGNS TO SHOW HOW TO DISCOVER WHETHER
THIS FAVOUR IS A DECEPTION OR NOT: THIS IS VERY NOTEWORTHY.

*1. Locutions. 2. Sometimes caused by melancholia. 3. Caution needed at
first. 4. Locutions frequently occur during prayer. 5. Resist those
containing false doctrine. 6. First sign of genuine locutions. 7. Effect
of the words: 'Be not troubled.' 8. 'It is I, be not afraid.' 9. 'Be at
Peace.' 10. Second sign. 11. Third sign. 12. The devil suggests doubts
about true locutions. 13. Confidence of the soul rewarded. 14. Its joy
at seeing God's words verified. 15. Its zeal for God's honour. 16.
Locutions coining from the fancy. 17. Imaginary answers given to prayer.
18. A confessor should be consulted about locutions. 19. Interior
locutions. 20. First sign of genuine interior locutions. 21. Second
sign. 22. Third sign. 23. Fourth sign. 24. Fifth sign. 25. Results of
true locutions. 26. They should remove alarm. 27. Answer to an
objection*.

1\. GOD arouses the soul in another manner which, though in some ways
apparently a greater favour than the above mentioned, yet may prove more
dangerous, therefore I will give some particulars about it. He does this
by means of words addressed to the soul in many different ways;
sometimes they appear to come from without; at other times

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

from the inner depths of the soul; or again, from its superior part;
while other speeches are so exterior as to be heard by the ears like a
real voice.

2\. At times, indeed very often, this may be only a fancy; especially
with persons of a lively imagination or who are afflicted with
melancholy to any marked extent. I think that no attention should be
paid to either class of people when they say they see, hear, or learn
anything supernaturally. Do not disturb them by saying that it comes
from the devil, <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_237.md) but listen to them
as if they were sick persons. Let the prioress or confessor to whom they
tell their story bid them think no more of it as such matters are not
essential in the service of God: the devil has deceived many Christians
thus, although perhaps it is not so in their case; therefore they need
not trouble themselves about it. Thus we must accomodate ourselves to
their humour: if we tell them their fancies proceed from melancholia,
there will be no end to the matter, for they will persist in maintaining
they have seen and heard these things, for so it seems to them.

3\. The truth is, care should be taken to keep such people from too much
prayer and to persuade them, as far as possible, to take no notice of
their fancies: the devil makes use of these weak souls to injure others,
even if they themselves escape unhurt. There is need for caution both
with feeble and strong souls at first, until it is certain from what
spirit these things proceed. I maintain that, in the beginning, it is
always wiser to resist these

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

communications; if they come from God this is the best way to receive
more, for they increase when discouraged. At the same time the soul
should not be too strictly controlled or disquieted, for it cannot help
itself in the matter.

4\. To return to discuss the words addressed to the soul: any kind I
mentioned may come either from God, the devil, or the imagination. By
the help of God I will endeavour to describe the signs distinguishing
the one from the other, and when these locutions are dangerous, for they
occur to many persons who praise prayer. I do not wish you to think,
sisters, that there is any harm either in believing or in disregarding
them. When they only console you, or warn you of your faults, it matters
not whence they come or whether they are only fancies.

5\. I caution you on one point--although they may come from God, you
must not esteem yourself more highly, for He often spoke to the
Pharisees <span id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_238.md)--all the good consists
in profiting by His words. Take no more notice of any speeches you hear
which disagree with the Holy Scriptures than if you heard them from
Satan himself. Though they may only rise from your vivid imagination,
look upon them as a temptation against the faith. Always resist them;
then they will leave you, and cease, for they have little strength of
their own. <span id="fr_239"></span>[3](#fn_239.md)

6\. Now let us return to the first point--whether these communications
come from the inferior or

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

the superior part of the soul, or from without, does not affect their
originating from God.

7\. In my opinion these are the most certain signs of their being
divine. The first and truest is the power and authority they carry with
them, for these words are operative. <span
id="fr_240"></span>[4](#fn_240.md) For example: a soul is suffering all the
sorrow and disquiet I have described: the mind is darkened and dry; but
it is set at peace, freed from all trouble and filled with light merely
by hearing the words: 'Be not troubled.' These deliver it from all its
pains, although it felt as though, if the whole world and all its
theologians had united in trying to persuade it there was no cause for
grief, it could not, in spite of all their efforts, have been delivered
from its affliction. <span id="fr_241"></span>[5](#fn_241.md)

8\. Again, a person is troubled and greatly terrified at being told by
her confessor and other people that her soul is under the influence of
the evil one: she hears a single sentence which says, 'It is I, be not
afraid,' <span id="fr_242"></span>[6](#fn_242.md) and is at once freed from
all fears and filled with consolation; indeed, she believes it would be
impossible for any one to disturb her confidence. <span
id="fr_243"></span>[7](#fn_243.md)

9\. Again, when exceedingly anxious about important business, not
knowing whether or not it will be successful, on hearing words bidding
her

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Be at peace; all
will go well,' she feels reassured and free from all care in the
matter. <span id="fr_244"></span>[8](#fn_244.md) Many other instances of
the same sort could be mentioned.

10\. The second sign is a great calm and a devout and peaceful
recollection which dwell in the soul together with a desire to praise
God. They say that communications, at any rate in this mansion, are not
uttered direly by God but are transmitted by an angel. <span
id="fr_245"></span>[9](#fn_245.md) Then, O my God, if a word sent to us by
Thee through Thy messenger has such force, what effects wilt Thou not
leave in the soul united to Thee in a mutual bond of love? <span
id="fr_246"></span>[10](#fn_246.md)

11\. The third proof is that these words do not pass from the memory but
remain there for a very long time; sometimes they are never forgotten.
This is not the case with what *men* may utter, which, however grave and
learned they may be, is not thus impressed on our memory. Neither, if
they prophesy of things to come, do we believe them as we do these
divine locutions which leave us so convinced of their truth that,
although their fulfilment sometimes seems utterly impossible and we
vacillate and doubt about them, there still

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

remains in the soul a certainty of their verity which cannot be
destroyed. Perhaps everything may seem to militate against what was
heard and years pass by, yet the spirit never loses its belief that God
will make use of means unknown to men for the purpose and that finally
what was foretold must surely happen; as indeed it does. <span
id="fr_247"></span>[11](#fn_247.md)

12\. Still, as I said, the soul is troubled at seeing many obstacles in
the way of the accomplishment of the prophecy. The words, their effects,
and the assurance they carry with them convinced the soul at the moment
that they came from God. Afterwards, however, doubts arise as to whether
the locutions came from the devil or from the imagination, although
while hearing them the person would have died to defend their
truth. <span id="fr_248"></span>[12](#fn_248.md) But, as I said, these
misgivings must be suggested by the evil one to afflict and intimidate
her, especially if by carrying out a command thus given great good will
result to souls and some work be done conducing notably to the honour
and service of God, concerning which great difficulties have to be
overcome. In such cases, where will Satan stop short? At least, he
weakens faith, and it is a terrible evil to doubt that God has power to
work in a way far beyond our understanding.

13\. Despite all these difficulties and although the confessors
consulted on these matters say the words were but fancies, while events
take such an unfavourable turn as to make the realization of these
predictions seem impossible, yet there remains so

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

lively a spark of certainty in the mind (I know not whence it comes)
that, although all other hopes die out, it cannot, if it would, quench
this ardent spark of confidence. At last, as I said, our Lord's words
are accomplished, at which the soul is so satisfied and joyful that it
can do nothing but praise His Majesty--more because it sees His words
prove true than on account of the thing itself, even though it may be of
consequence to the person concerned.

14\. I know not why the soul attaches such importance to these
communications being verified. I think that if the person herself were
detected in telling falsehoods, she would not be so grieved as at these
locutions proving untrue--as if she could do anything in the matter
beyond repeating what has been said to her! A certain person was
frequently reminded in such a case of the Prophet Jonas, when he found
Ninive was not to be destroyed. <span id="fr_249"></span>[13](#fn_249.md)

15\. In fact, as these words come from the Spirit of God, it is right
thus to trust them and to desire that He Who is supreme truth should not
be thought a deceiver. Justly, therefore, does their hearer rejoice
when, after a thousand delays and enormous difficulties, they are
accomplished. Although this success may entail great suffering on
herself, she prefers it to the nonfulfilment of what she knows our Lord
most certainly foretold. Possibly every one is not so weak as this, if
indeed it

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

is a weakness, though I cannot myself condemn it as an evil.

16\. If these locutions proceed from the imagination <span
id="fr_250"></span>[14](#fn_250.md) they show no such signs, bringing
neither conviction, peace, nor interior joy with them. But in some cases
I have come across, on account of a very weak constitution or vivid
imagination or of other causes I do not know, persons while absorbed in
the prayer of quiet and in spiritual slumber are so entirely carried out
of themselves by their deep state of recollection as to be unconscious
of anything external. All their senses being thus dormant, as if
asleep--as indeed, at times they really are--they thus, in a sort of
dream, fancy they are spoken to or see things they imagine come from
God, but which leave no more effect than dreams.

17\. Again, one who very lovingly asks something of our Lord may fancy
that an answer comes from Him. <span id="fr_251"></span>[15](#fn_251.md)
This often occurs, but I think that no one accustomed to receive divine
communications could be deceived on this point by the imagination.

18\. The devil's deceptions are more dangerous; but if the foregoing
signs are present, we may feel fairly confident that these locutions are
from God, though not so certain but that, if they refer to some weighty
matter in which we are called upon to act or if they concern a third
person, we should consult some confessor who is both learned and a
servant of God, before attempting or thinking of acting on them,
although we may have heard them repeated several times and are convinced
of their

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

truth and divine origin. <span id="fr_252"></span>[16](#fn_252.md) His
Majesty wishes us to take this course; it is not disobedience to His
commands, for He has bidden us hold our confessor as His representative
even where there is no doubt that the communications come from Him: thus
we shall gain courage if the matter is a very difficult one. Our Lord
will reassure our confessor, whom, when He so chooses, He will inspire
with faith that these locutions are from the Holy Ghost. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[17](#fn_253.md) If not, we are freed from all further
obligations in the matter. I think it would be very dangerous to act
against our confessor's advice and to prefer our own opinions in such a
matter. Therefore, sisters, I admonish you in the name of our Lord,
never to do anything of the sort.

19\. God speaks to the soul in another way by a certain intellectual
vision which I think undoubtedly proceeds from Him; it will be described
later on. <span id="fr_254"></span>[18](#fn_254.md)8 It takes place far
within the innermost depths of the soul which appears to hear distinctly
in a most mysterious manner, with its spiritual hearing, the words
spoken to it by our Lord Himself. The way in which the spirit perceives
these words and the results produced by them, convince us that they
cannot in any way come from the devil. Their powerful aftereffects force
us to admit this and plainly show they do not spring from the
imagination. <span id="fr_255"></span>[19](#fn_255.md) Careful
consideration will assure us of this for the following reasons;--

20\. Firstly, the clearness of the language varies

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

in the different kinds of locutions. Those that are divine are so
distinct that the hearer remembers if there were a syllable missing, and
what words were made use of even though a whole sentence was spoken. But
if the speech were only a freak of fancy, it would not be so audible nor
would the words be so distinct but would be only half articulated. <span
id="fr_256"></span>[20](#fn_256.md)

21\. The second reason is that often the person was not thinking of what
is heard; sometimes the locution even comes unexpectedly during
conversation, though at times it refers to some thought that passed
quickly through the mind or to a subject it was before engaged upon.
Frequently it concerns things of whose existence the hearer knew nothing
nor even imagined such events could ever come to pass; therefore it is
impossible for the imagination to have framed such speeches and deceived
the mind by fancies about what it had never wished, nor sought for, nor
even thought about. <span id="fr_257"></span>[21](#fn_257.md)

22\. The third reason is that in a genuine case the soul seems to listen
to the words, whereas when the imagination is at work, little by little
it composes what the person wishes to hear. <span
id="fr_258"></span>[22](#fn_258.md)

23\. The fourth reason is because divine locutions differ immensely from
others, a single word comprising a depth of meaning which our
understanding could not thus quickly condense into one phrase. <span
id="fr_259"></span>[23](#fn_259.md)

24\. Fifthly because, in a manner I cannot explain, these
communications, without any further explanations, frequently give us to
understand far

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

more than is implied by the words themselves. I shall speak farther on
of this way of understanding hidden things which is very subtle and a
favour for which we should thank God. Some people are exceedingly
suspicious about these and other communications of the same kind. I
speak particularly of some one <span id="fr_260"></span>[24](#fn_260.md)
who experienced them herself, though there may be others who cannot
understand them. I know that she has considered the subject very
carefully, God having often bestowed this grace on her. Her principal
difficulty was to discover whether the locutions were merely fancied. It
is easier to know when they come from the devil although being so wily,
he can with facility imitate the spirit of light. However, he would do
this in a form of words pronounced so distinctly that there would be no
more doubt as to their reality than if they came from the spirit of
truth, while those coming from the imagination leave us uncertain
whether we heard the words or not. But Satan could never counterfeit the
effects I spoke of; <span id="fr_261"></span>[25](#fn_261.md) he leaves
neither peace nor light in the soul, only anxiety and confusion. In any
case, he can do little or no harm to one who is humble and who, as I
advised, does not act on what is heard.

25\. If the soul receives favours and caresses from our Lord, let it
examine carefully whether it rates itself more highly in consequence;
unless self-abasement increases with God's expressions of love,

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

they do not come from the Holy Spirit. Inevitably, when they are divine,
the greater the favours, the less the soul esteems itself and the more
keenly it remembers its sins. <span id="fr_262"></span>[26](#fn_262.md) It
becomes more oblivious of self-interest: the will and memory grow more
fervent in seeking solely God's honour with no thought of self. It also
becomes unceasingly careful not to deviate deliberately from the will of
God and feels a keener conviction that instead of meriting such favours,
it deserves hell.

26\. When these results follow, no graces or gifts received during
prayer need alarm the soul which should rather trust in the mercy of
God, Who is faithful and will not allow the devil to deceive it; but it
is always well to be on one's guard.

27\. Those our Lord does not lead by this path may suppose that the soul
can avoid listening to these locutions and that even if they are
interior it is at least possible to distract the attention from them so
as not to hear them and thus escape danger. This cannot be done: I am
not speaking of freaks of fancy which may be prevented by ceasing to
desire certain things or by paying no attention to its inventions. This
is not feasible when these communications come from the Holy Ghost Who,
when He speaks, stops all other thoughts and compels the mind to
listen. <span id="fr_263"></span>[27](#fn_263.md) Mark this: that I believe
it would be easier for a person with very keen ears to avoid hearing a
loud voice, for he could occupy

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

his thoughts and mind in other things. Not so here; the soul can do
nothing, nor has it ears to stop, nor power to think of aught but what
is said to it. For He Who could stay the sun on its course (at the
prayer of Josue, <span id="fr_264"></span>[28](#fn_264) I believe.md) can
so quiet the faculties and the interior of the spirit as to make it
perceive that another and a stronger Lord than itself governs this
castle; it is thus affected with profound devotion and humility, seeing
that it cannot but listen. May the divine Majesty vouchsafe that,
forgetting ourselves, our only aim may be to please Him, as I said.
Amen. God grant I have succeeded in explaining what I wished and that it
may be some guide to those who may experience such favours.
