### INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER III.

###### BY THE EDITOR

THE readers, especially those not well acquainted with Scholastic
philosophy, will, perhaps, be glad to find here a short explanation of
the various kinds. of Vision and Locution, Corporal, Imaginary, and
Intellectual. The senses of Taste, Touch, and Smell are not so often
affected by mystical phenomena, but what we are about to say in respect
of Sight and Hearing applies, mutatis mutandis, to these also.

1\. A CORPORAL VISION is when one sees a bodily object. A Corporal
Locution is when one hears words uttered by a human tongue. In both
cases the respective senses are exercising their normal function, and
the phenomenon differs from ordinary seeing or hearing merely by the
fact that in the latter the object seen is a real body, the words
perceived come from a real tongue, whereas in the Vision or Locution the
object is either only apparent or at any rate is not such as it seems to
be. Thus, when young Tobias set out on a journey, his companion,
Azarias, was not a real human being, but an archangel in human form.
Tobias did really see and hear him, and felt the grip of his hand; Sara
and her parents, as well as Tobias's parents, saw and heard him too, but
all the time the archangel made himself visible and audible by means of
an assumed body, or perhaps of an apparent body. It would be more
correct to describe such a phenomenon as an APPARITION than as a Vision,
and in fact the apparitions of our Risen Lord to the holy women and the
apostles belong to this category. For, though His was a real body, it
was glorified and therefore no longer subject to the same laws which
govern purely human things. (St. Thomas, *Summa theol*. III., qu. 54,
art. I-3).

St. Teresa tells us more than once that she never

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

beheld a Corporal Vision, nor heard a Corporal Locution.

II\. AN IMAGINARY VISION OR LOCUTION is one where nothing is seen or
heard by the senses of seeing or hearing, but where the same impression
is received that would be produced upon the imagination by the senses if
some real object were perceived by them. For, according to the
Scholastics, the Imagination stands half-way between the senses and the
intellect, receiving impressions from the former and transmitting them
to the latter. This is the reason why imaginary Visions and Locutions
are so dangerous that, according to St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross,
and other spiritual writers, they should not only never be sought for,
but as much as possible shunned and under all circumstances
discountenanced. For the Imagination is closely connected with the
Memory, so that it is frequently impossible to ascertain whether a
Vision, etc., is not perhaps a semi-conscious or unconscious
reproduction of scenes witnessed. It is here also that deception, wilful
or unwilful, self-deception or deception by a higher agency, is to be
feared. Hence the general rule that such Visions or Locutions should
only be trusted upon the strongest grounds. According to St. Thomas
Aquinas, (*Summa theol. IIa IIæ*, gu. 175, art. 3 ad q.) the visions of
Isaias, St. John in the Apocalypse etc., were Imaginary.

As an example of Imaginary Visions we may mention St. Stephen, who saw
'the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of
God'; or St. Peter, who saw 'the heaven opened, and a certain vessel
descending, as it were a great linen sheet, let down by the four corners
from heaven to the earth . . . and there came a voice to him: Arise,
Peter, kill and eat.' (Acts, vii. 55; X. 11-13).

These Visions, Locutions, etc., are not hallucinations. The latter are
due to physical disorder which affects the memory and causes it to
represent impressions formerly received by it, in a disorderly and often
grotesque manner. The Imaginary Vision takes place independently of a

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

morbid state, is caused by an extraneous power, good or evil, and has
for its object things of which the memory neither has nor ever has had
cognizance.

III\. AN INTELLECTUAL VISION OR LOCUTION is one where nothing is seen or
heard by the eyes and ears, and where no sensation is received by the
imagination. But the impression which would be delivered by the
imagination to the intellect, had it come through the senses and been
handed on to the imagination, is directly imprinted upon the intellect.
To understand this it is necessary to bear in mind that the impressions
we receive through the senses must undergo a transformation--must be
spiritualized--before they reach the intellect. This is one of the most
difficult problems of psychology; none of the solutions offered by
various schools of philosophy seem to render it entirely free from
obscurity. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the impression received by
the eye (*Species sensibilis*) is spiritualized by a faculty called
*Intellectus agens* by means of abstraction (*Species impressa*), and is
treasured up in the memory, like lantern slides, available at demand.
The mind, identifying itself with the Species impressa, produces the
'Word of the mind' (*Verbum mentis*), wherein consists the act of
Understanding or Mental Conception. In the Intellectual Vision or
Locution, God, without co-operation on the part of the senses, the
imagination, or the memory, produces directly on the mind the *Species
impressa*. As this is supernatural with regard to its origin, and often
also with respect to its object, it stands to reason that it is too
exalted for the memory to receive it, so that such Visions and Locutions
are frequently only imperfectly remembered and sometimes altogether
forgotten, as St. Teresa tells us. On the other hand they are far less
dangerous than Corporal or Imaginary Visions and Locutions, because the
senses and imagination have nothing to do with them, whilst evil spirits
are unable to act directly upon the mind, and self-deception is
altogether excluded for the reasons stated by St. Teresa.

An instance of such a vision is mentioned by St. Paul: 'I know a man in
Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out
of the body I know not: God knoweth), such an one rapt even to the third
heaven. And I know such a man (whether in the body or out of the body, I
know not: God knoweth): that he was caught up into paradise, and heard
secret words, which it is not granted to man to utter' (2 Cor. xii.
2-4).
