### CHAPTER III.

THE GREAT FRUITS PRODUCED BY THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PRAYER. THE WONDERFUL
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE EFFECTS AND THOSE FORMERLY DESCRIBED SHOULD BE
CAREFULLY STUDIED AND REMEMBERED.

*1. Effects of the graces last received. 2. The soul only cares for
God's honour. 3. But still performs its duties. 4. Other fruits of these
favours. 5. The soul's fervent desire to serve God. 6. Christ dwells
within this soul. 7. And recalls it to fervour if negligent. 8. God's
constant care of such souls. 9. Their peace and silence. 10. Few
ecstasies in the Seventh Mansions. 11. Probable reasons for this. 12.
Allusions in Holy Scripture to this state. 13. Watchfulness of such
souls. 14. Crosses suffered in this state*.

1\. THE little butterfly has died with the greatest joy at having found
rest at last, and now Christ lives in her. <span
id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_419.md) Let us see the difference between her
present and her former life, for the effects will prove whether what I
told you was true. As far as can be ascertained they are these: first, a
self-forgetfulness so complete that she really appears not to exist, as
I said, <span id="fr_420"></span>[2](#fn_420.md) for such a transformation
has been worked in her that she no longer recognizes herself; nor does
she remember that heaven, or life, or glory are to be hers, but seems
entirely occupied in seeking God's interests. Apparently the words
spoken by His Majesty have done their work: 'that she was to care for
His affairs, and He would care for hers.' <span
id="fr_421"></span>[3](#fn_421.md)

2\. Thus she recks nothing, whatever happens, but lives in such strange
oblivion that, as I stated, she seems no longer to exist, nor does she
wish to be of

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

any account in anything--*anything*! unless she sees that she can
advance, however little, the honour and glory of God, for which she
would most willingly die.

3\. Do not fancy I mean, daughters, that she neglects to eat and drink,
though it brings no small torment to her, or to perform the duties of
her state. I am speaking of her interior; as regards her exterior
actions there is little to say, for her chief suffering is to see that
she has hardly strength to do anything. For nothing in the world would
she omit doing all she can which she knows would honour our Lord.

4\. The second fruit is a strong desire for suffering, though it does
not disturb her peace as before because the fervent wish of such souls
for the fulfilment of God's will in them makes them acquiesce in all He
does. If He would have her suffer, she is content; if not, she does not
torment herself to death about it as she used to do. She feels a great
interior joy when persecuted, and is far more peaceful than in the
former state under such circumstances: she bears no grudge against her
enemies, nor wishes them any ill. Indeed she has a special love for
them, is deeply grieved at seeing them in trouble, and does all she can
to relieve them, <span id="fr_422"></span>[4](#fn_422.md) earnestly
interceding with God on their behalf. She would be glad to forfeit the
favours His Majesty shows her, if they might be given to her enemies
instead, to prevent their offending our Lord.

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

5\. The most surprising thing to me is that the sorrow and distress
which such souls felt because they could not die and enjoy our Lord's
presence <span id="fr_423"></span>[5](#fn_423.md) are now exchanged for as
fervent a desire of serving Him, of causing Him to be praised, and of
helping others to the utmost of their power. Not only have they ceased
to long for death, but they wish for a long life and most heavy crosses,
if such would bring ever so little honour to our Lord. Thus, if they
knew for certain that immediately on quitting their bodies their souls
would enjoy God, it would make no difference to them, nor do they think
of the glory enjoyed by the saints, and long to share it. Such souls
hold that their glory consists in helping, in any way, Him Who was
crucified, especially as they see how men offend against Him, and how
few, detached from all else, care for His honour alone. True, people in
this state forget this at times, and are seized with tender longings to
enjoy God and to leave this land of exile, especially as they see how
little they serve Him. Then, returning to themselves and reflecting how
they possess Him continually in their souls, they are satisfied,
offering to His Majesty their willingness to live as the most costly
oblation they can make. <span id="fr_424"></span>[6](#fn_424.md) They fear
death no more than they would a delicious trance.

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

\[6. The fact is, that He Who gave them these torturing desires of death
has exchanged them for the others. May He be for ever blessed and
praised! Amen. In fact, such persons no longer wish for consolations nor
delights, since they bear God Himself within them, and it is He Who
lives in them. It is evident that His life was one continual torment: so
would He have ours to be, at least in desire, for as to the rest He
leads us mercifully as our weakness requires, though when He sees the
need He imparts to us His strength.\]

7\. Such a soul, thoroughly detached from all things, wishes to be
either always alone or occupied on what benefits the souls of others:
she feels neither aridity nor any interior troubles, but a constant
tender recollection of our Lord Whom she wishes to praise unceasingly.
When she grows negligent, the same Lord arouses her in the way that I
told you, and it is easy to see that this impulse (I know not what term
to use for it) comes from the interior of the soul, like the former
impetuous desires. <span id="fr_425"></span>[7](#fn_425.md) It is now felt
very sweetly, but is neither produced by the intellect nor the memory,
nor is there reason to believe the soul itself has any share in it. This
is so usual and so frequent that whoever has been in this state must
have noticed it. However large a fire may be, the flame never burns
downwards, but upwards, and so this movement is seen to come from the
centre of the soul whose powers it excites. Indeed, were nothing else
gained by this way of prayer but the knowledge of the special care God
takes to communicate Himself to us and how He entreats us to abide with
Him (for indeed I can describe it in no other way) I think that for the
sake of these sweet and penetrating touches of His love all our past
pains would be well spent.

8\. You will have learnt this by experience, sisters, for I think that
when our Lord has brought us to the prayer of union, He watches over us
in this way unless we neglect to keep His commandments. When these
impulses are given you, remember that they come from the innermost
mansion, where

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God dwells in our
souls. Praise Him fervently, for it is He Who sends you this message, or
love letter, so tenderly written, and in a cipher that only you can
understand and know what He asks. By no means neglect to answer His
Majesty, even though you may be occupied exteriorly and engaged in
conversation. Our Lord may often be pleased to show you this secret
favour in public; but it is very easy, as the reply should be entirely
interior, to respond by an at of love or to ask with Saint Paul: 'Lord,
what wilt Thou have me to do?" <span id="fr_426"></span>[8](#fn_426.md)
Jesus will show you in many ways how to please Him. It is a propitious
moment, for He seems to be listening to us and the soul is nearly always
disposed by this delicate touch to respond with a generous
determination. <span id="fr_427"></span>[9](#fn_427.md) As I told you, this
mansion differs from the rest in that, as I said, <span
id="fr_428"></span>[10](#fn_428.md) the dryness and disturbance felt in all
the rest at times hardly ever enter here, where the soul is nearly
always calm. It does not fear that this sublime favour can be
counterfeited by the devil, but feels a settled conviction that it is of
divine origin because, as above stated, nothing is here perceived

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

by the senses or faculties but His Majesty reveals Himself to the
spirit, which He takes to be with Himself in a place where I doubt not
the devil dares not enter, nor would our Lord ever permit him.

9\. All the graces here divinely bestowed on the soul come, as I said,
through no a Lion of its own except its total abandonment of itself to
God. They are given in peace and silence, like the building of Solomon's
Temple where no sound was heard. <span id="fr_429"></span>[11](#fn_429.md)
It is thus with this temple of God, this mansion of His where He and the
soul rejoice in each other alone in profound silence. The mind need not
act nor search for anything, as the Lord Who created it wishes it to be
at rest and only to watch through a little chink, what passes within.
Though at times it cannot see this, yet such intervals are very short, I
believe because the powers are not here lost but only cease to work,
being, as it were, dazed with astonishment.

10\. I, too, am astonished at seeing that when the soul arrives at this
state it does not go into ecstasies except perhaps on rare
occasions--even then they are not like the former trances and the flight
of the spirit and seldom take place in public as they did before. <span
id="fr_430"></span>[12](#fn_430.md) They are no longer produced by any
special calls to devotion, such as by the sight of a religious picture,
by hearing a sermon (were it only the first few words), or by sacred
music; formerly, like the poor little butterfly, the soul

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

was so anxious that anything used to alarm it and make it take flight.
This may be either because the spirit has at last found repose, or that
it has seen such wonders in this mansion that nothing can frighten it,
or perhaps because it no longer feels solitary since it rejoices in such
Company.

11\. In short, sisters, I cannot tell the reason, but as soon as God
shows the soul what this mansion contains, bringing it to dwell within
the precincts, the infirmity formerly so troublesome to the mind and
impossible to get over, disappears at once. Probably this is because our
Lord has now strengthened, dilated, and developed the soul, or it may be
that He wished to make public (for some end known only to Himself) what
He was doing in secret within such souls, for His judgments are beyond
our comprehension in this life.

12\. These effects, with all the other good fruits I have mentioned of
the different degrees of prayer, are given by God to the soul when it
draws near Him to receive that 'kiss of His mouth' for which the bride
asked, <span id="fr_431"></span>[13](#fn_431.md) and I believe her petition
is now granted. Here the overflowing waters are given to the wounded
hart: here she delights in the tabernacles of God <span
id="fr_432"></span>[14](#fn_432.md): here the dove sent out by Noe to see
whether the flood had subsided, has plucked the olive branch, showing
that she has found firm land amongst the floods and tempests of this
world. <span id="fr_433"></span>[15](#fn_433.md) O Jesus! Who knows how
much in Holy Scripture refers to this peace of soul? Since, O my God,
Thou dost see of what grave import is this peace

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

to us, do Thou incite Christians to strive to gain it! In Thy mercy do
not deprive those of it on whom Thou hast bestowed it, for until Thou
hast given them true peace and brought them to where it is unending,
they must ever live in fear.

13\. I do not mean that peace is unreal on earth because I say 'true
peace,' but that such souls might have to begin all their struggles over
again if they forsook God. What must these people feel at the thought
that it is possible to lose so great a good? Their dread makes them more
careful; they try to gather strength from their weakness lest, through
their own fault, they should miss any opportunity of pleasing God
better. The greater the favours they have received from His Majesty, the
more diffident and mistrustful are they of themselves; the marvels they
have witnessed having revealed more clearly to them their own miseries
and the heinousness of their sins, so that often, like the publican,
they dare not so much as lift up their eyes. <span
id="fr_434"></span>[16](#fn_434.md)

14\. Sometimes they long to die and be in safety, but then their love at
once makes them wish to live in order to serve God, as I told you;
therefore they commit all that concerns them to His mercy. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[17](#fn_435.md) At times they are more crushed than
ever by the thought of the many graces they have received lest, like an
overladen ship, they sink beneath the burden. I assure you, sisters,
such souls have their cross to bear, yet it does not trouble them nor
rob them of their peace, but is quickly gone like a wave or a storm
which is followed by a calm, for God's

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

presence within them soon makes them forget all else. May He be for ever
blessed and praised by all His creatures! Amen,
