*The Interior Castle*, by St. Teresa of Avila, \[1921\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### NOTE

IN this new edition the wording has been revised I and condensed,
chiefly with a view to rendering the translation more pregnant. Only one
passage (VI. Mansion, ch. v. 13) has been substantially changed, in
conformity with an explanation received from a high authority. It is
admittedly a very difficult passage which appears to have been
misunderstood by nearly all translators; but it is gratifying to notice
that the new French translation by the Carmelite nuns of Anderlecht
agrees with our interpretation. The editor is under an obligation to
that translation for several interesting facts embodied in the
Introduction and in the notes to the text.
