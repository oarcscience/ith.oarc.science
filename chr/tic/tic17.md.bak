longings. 3. Courage needed to reach the last mansions. 4. Trials
accompanying divine favours. 5. Outcry raised against souls striving for
perfection. 6. St. Teresa's personal experience of this. 7. Praise
distasteful to an enlightened soul. 8. This changes to indifference. 9.

mansions*.

1\. BY the aid of the Holy Ghost I am now about to treat of the sixth
mansions, where the soul, wounded with love for its Spouse, sighs more
than ever for solitude, withdrawing as far as the duties of its state
permit from all that can interrupt it,

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The sight it has
enjoyed of Him is so deeply imprinted on the spirit that its only desire
is to behold Him again. I have already said that, <span
id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) even by the imagination, nothing is seen
in this prayer that can be called sight. I speak of it as 'sight'
because of the comparison I used.

2\. The soul is now determined to take no other Bridegroom than our
Lord, but He disregards its desires for its speedy espousals, wishing
that these longings should become still more vehement and that this
good, which far excels all other benefits, should be purchased at some
cost to itself. And although for so great a gain all that we must endure
is but a poor price to pay, I assure you, daughters, that this pledge of
what is in store for us is needed to inspire us with courage to bear our
crosses.

3\. O My God, how many troubles both interior and exterior must one
suffer before entering the seventh mansions! Sometimes, while pondering
over this I fear that, were they known beforehand, human infirmity could
scarcely bear the thought nor resolve to encounter them, however great
might appear the gain. If, however, the soul has already reached the
seventh mansions, it fears nothing: boldly undertaking to suffer all
things for God, <span id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_209.md) it gathers
strength from its almost uninterrupted union with Him.

4\. I think it would be well to tell you of some of the trials certain
to occur in this state. Possibly all souls may not be led in this way,
but I think that those who sometimes enjoy such truly heavenly

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

favours cannot be altogether free from some sort of earthly troubles.
Therefore, although at first I did not intend to speak on this subject,
yet afterwards I thought that it might greatly comfort a soul in this
condition if it knew what usually happens to those on whom God bestows
graces of this kind, for at the time they really seem to have lost
everything.

5\. I shall not enumerate these trials in their proper order, but will
describe them as they come to my memory, beginning with the least
severe. This is an outcry raised against such a person by those amongst
whom she lives, and even from others she has nothing to do with but who
fancy that at some time in her life they recollect having seen her. They
say she wants to pass for a saint, that she goes to extremes in piety to
deceive the world and to depreciate people who are better Christians
than herself without making such a parade of it. But notice that she
does nothing except endeavour to carry out the duties of her state more
perfectly. Persons she thought were her friends desert her, making the
most bitter remarks of all. They take it much to heart that her soul is
ruined--she is manifestly deluded--it is all the devil's work--she will
share the fate of so-and-so who was lost through him, and she is leading
virtue astray. They cry out that she is deceiving her confessors, and
tell them so, citing examples of others who came to ruin in the same way
and make a thousand scoffing remarks of the same sort. <span
id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_210.md)

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

6\. I know some one who feared she would be unable to find any priest
who would hear her confession, to such a pass did things come; but as it
is a long story, I will not stop to tell it now. The worst of it is,
these troubles do not blow over but last all her life, for one person
warns the other to have nothing to do with people of her kind. You will
say that, on the other hand, some speak in her favour. O my daughters,
how few think well of her in comparison with the many who hate her!

7\. Besides this, praise pains such a soul more than blame because it
recognizes clearly that any good it possesses is the gift of God and in
no wise its own, seeing that but a short time ago it was weak in virtue
and involved in grave sins. <span id="fr_211"></span>[4](#fn_211.md)
Therefore commendation causes it intolerable suffering, at least at
first, although later on, for many reasons, the soul is comparatively
indifferent to either.

8\. The first is that experience has shown the mind that men are as
ready to speak well as ill of others, so it attaches no more importance
to the one than to the other. Secondly, our Lord having granted it
greater light, it perceives that no good thing in it is its own but is
His gift, and becomes oblivious of self, praising God for His graces as
if they were found in a third person.

9\. The third reason is that, realizing the benefit reaped by others
from witnessing graces given it by God, such a one thinks that it is for
their profit He causes them to discover in her virtues that do not
exist.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

10\. Fourthly, souls seeking God's honour and glory more than their own
are cured of the temptation (which usually besets beginners) of thinking
that human praise will cause them the injury they have seen it do to
others. Nor do these souls care much for men's contempt if only, by
their means, any one should praise God at least once--come what may
afterwards.

11\. These and other reasons to a certain extent allay the great
distress formerly given by human praise which, however, still causes
some discomfort unless the soul has become utterly regardless of men's
tongues. It is infinitely more grieved at being undeservedly esteemed by
the world than by any calumny; and when at last it becomes almost
indifferent to praise, it cares still less for censure, which even
pleases it and sounds like harmonious music to the ears.

12\. This is perfectly true; the soul is rather strengthened than
depressed by its trials, experience having taught it the great
advantages derived from them. It does not think men offend God by
persecuting it, but that He permits them to do so for its greater
gain. <span id="fr_212"></span>[5](#fn_212.md) So strong is this belief
that such a person bears a special affection for these people, holding
them as truer friends and greater benefactors than those who speak well
of her. <span id="fr_213"></span>[6](#fn_213.md)

13\. Our Lord now usually sends severe bodily infirmity. This is a far
heavier cross, especially if acute pain is felt: if this is violent, I
think it is the

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

hardest of earthly trials. I speak of exterior trials; but corporal
pains if of the worst kind enter the interior of our being also,
affecting both spirit and body, so that the soul in its anguish knows
not what to do with itself and would far rather meet death at once by
some quick martyrdom than suffer thus. However, these paroxysms do not
last long, for God never sends us more than we can bear and always gives
us patience first.

14\. Now to speak of other trials and illnesses of many kinds which
generally occur to people in this state. I knew some one who, from the
time when, forty years ago, <span id="fr_214"></span>[7](#fn_214.md) our
Lord began to bestow on her the favour described, could not affirm with
any truth that she had been a single day without pain and other kinds of
suffering: I am speaking of physical infirmities besides heavy crosses
sent her. <span id="fr_215"></span>[8](#fn_215.md) True, she had led a
wicked life and therefore held these troubles very light in comparison
with the hell she had deserved. <span id="fr_216"></span>[9](#fn_216.md)
Our Lord leads those who have offended Him less by some other way, but I
should always choose the way of suffering, if only for the sake of
imitating our Lord Jesus Christ; though, in fact, it profits us in many
other manners. Yet, oh! the rest would seem trifling in comparison could
I relate the interior torments met with here, but they are impossible to
describe.

15\. Let us first speak of the trial of meeting with so timorous and
inexperienced a confessor that

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

nothing seems safe to him; he dreads and suspects everything but the
commonplace, especially in a soul in which he deters any imperfection,
for he thinks people on whom God bestows such favours must be angels,
which is impossible while we live in our bodies. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[10](#fn_217.md) He at once ascribes everything to the
devil or melancholy. As to the latter, I am not surprised; there is so
much of it in the world and the evil one works such harm in this way
that confessors have the strongest reasons for anxiety and watchfulness
about it.

16\. The poor soul, beset by the same fears, seeks its confessor as
judge, and feels a torture and dismay at his condemnation that can only
be realized by those who have experienced it themselves. <span
id="fr_218"></span>[11](#fn_218.md) For one of the severe trials of these
souls, especially if they have lived wicked lives, is their belief that
God permits them to be deceived in punishment for their sins. While
actually receiving these graces they feel secure and cannot but suppose
that these favours proceed from the Spirit of God; but this state lasts
a very short time, while the remembrance of their misdeeds is ever
before them, so that when, as is sure to happen, they discover any
faults in themselves, these torturing thoughts return. <span
id="fr_219"></span>[12](#fn_219.md)

17\. The soul is quieted for a time when the confessor reassures it
although it returns later on to its former apprehensions, but when he
augments its fears they become almost unbearable. Especially is this the
case when such spiritual dryness ensues

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

that the mind feels as if it never had thought of God nor ever will be
able to do so. When men speak of Him, they seem to be talking of some
person heard of long ago.

18\. All this is nothing without the further pain of thinking we cannot
make our confessors understand the case and are deceiving them. <span
id="fr_220"></span>[13](#fn_220.md) Although such a person may examine her
conscience with the greatest care, and may know that she reveals even
the first movement of her mind to her director, it does not help her.
Her understanding being too obscure to discern the truth, she believes
all that the imagination, which now has the upper hand, puts before her
mind, besides crediting the falsehoods suggested to her by the devil,
whom doubtless our Lord gives leave to tempt her. The evil spirit even
tries to make her think God has rejected her. Many are the trials which
assault this soul, causing an internal anguish so painful and so
intolerable that I can compare it to nothing save that suffered by the
lost in hell, for no comfort can be found in this tempest of
trouble. <span id="fr_221"></span>[14](#fn_221.md)

19\. If the soul seeks for consolation from its confessor, all the
demons appear to help him to torment it more. A confessor who dealt with
a person suffering in this manner thought that her state must be very
dangerous as so many things were troubling her; therefore, after she had
recovered from her trials, he bade her tell him whenever they

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

recurred: however, he found this made matters worse than ever. She lost
all control over herself: although she had learnt to read, yet she could
no more understand a book in the vulgar tongue than if she had not known
the alphabet, for her mind was incapable of acting. <span
id="fr_222"></span>[15](#fn_222.md)

20\. In short, there is no other remedy in such a tempest except to wait
for the mercy of God Who, unexpectedly, by some casual word or
unforeseen circumstance, suddenly dispels all these sorrows; then every
cloud of trouble disappears and the mind is left full of light and far
happier than before. <span id="fr_223"></span>[16](#fn_223.md) It praises
our Lord God like one who has come out victorious from a dangerous
battle, for it was He Who won the victory. The soul is fully conscious
that the conquest was not its own as all weapons of self-defence
appeared to be in the enemies' hands. Thus it realizes its weakness and
how little man can help himself if God forsake him.

21\. This truth now needs no demonstration, for past experience has
taught the soul its utter incapacity; it realizes the nothingness of
human nature and what miserable creatures we are. Although in a state of
grace from which it has not fallen--for, in spite of these torments, it
has not offended God, nor would it do so for any earthly thing <span
id="fr_224"></span>[17](#fn_224.md)--yet so hidden is this grace, that the
sufferer believes that neither now, nor in the past, has she ever
possessed the faintest spark of love for God. <span
id="fr_225"></span>[18](#fn_225.md) If at any time she has done good, or if
His Majesty ever bestowed

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

any favours on her, they seem to have been but a dream or a fancy, while
her sins stand clearly before her.

22\. O Jesus! how sad it is to see a soul thus forsaken, and how little,
as I said, can any earthly comfort avail! Do not imagine, sisters, if
you are ever brought to such a state, that rich and independent people
have more resources than yourselves in these troubles. No, no! to offer
such consolations would be like setting all the joys of the world before
people condemned to death: far from mitigating, it would increase their
torture. So with the souls I spoke of: their comfort must come from
above--nothing earthly can help them. This great God wishes us to
acknowledge His sovereignty and our own misery--an important point for
those who are to advance still farther.

23\. What can the poor soul do if such a trial lasts for many days?
Prayer makes no difference as far as comforting the heart, which no
consolation can enter, nor can the mind even grasp the meaning of the
words of vocal prayer: mental prayer is out of the question at such a
time, since the faculties are unequal to it. Solitude harms the soul,
yet society or conversation is a fresh torment. Strive as the sufferer
may to hide it, she is so wearied and out of sorts with all around that
she cannot but manifest her condition.

24\. How can the soul possibly tell what ails it? Its pains are
indescribable; it is wrung with nameless anguish and spiritual
suffering. The best remedy for these crosses (I do not mean for gaining
deliverance

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

from them, for I know of nothing that will do that, but for enabling one
to bear them) is to perform external works of charity and to trust in
the mercy of God, which never fails those who hope in Him. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[19](#fn_226.md) May He be for ever blessed! Amen

25\. The devils also bring about exterior trials which being more
unusual need not be mentioned. They are far less painful, for whatever
the demons may do, I believe they never succeed in paralysing the
faculties or disturbing the soul in the former manner. In fact, the
reason is able to discern that the evil spirits can do no more harm than
God permits; and while the mind has not lost its powers, all sufferings
are comparatively insignificant.

26\. I shall treat of other internal afflictions met with in this
mansion when describing the different kinds of prayer and favours
bestowed here by our Lord. Although some of these latter pains are
harder to endure, as appears by their bodily effects, yet they do not
deserve the name of crosses, nor have we the right to call them so.
Indeed, they are great graces from God as the soul recognizes amidst its
pangs, realizing how far it is from meriting such graces.

27\. This severe torture felt by souls just at the entrance of the
seventh mansion is accompanied by many other sufferings, some of which I
will mention: to speak of them all would be impossible, nor could I
portray them because they come from another and far higher source than
the rest. If I have succeeded so ill in writing of trials of a lower
kind, much less could I treat of the others. May

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God assist me in
all things, through the merits of His Son! Amen.
