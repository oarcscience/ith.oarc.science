### II.

### LETTER TO ALL THE FRIARS.

It was at the end of his days <span id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_441.md) when
he was ill, <span id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_442.md) that St. Francis wrote
this letter to the Minister General and to all the Friars. In it he
confesses all his sins to God, to the Saints and to the Friars, and in
weighty words urges once again what was ever uppermost in his mind and
heart: reverence toward the Blessed Sacrament, observance of the Rule
and the Divine Office. The same desires and counsels contained in this
letter may also be found in the Testament, and there is little doubt
that both works were composed about the same time.

This letter, like the preceding one, was wrongly divided by Rodolfo di
Tossignano. <span id="fr_443"></span>[3](#fn_443.md) Wadding following
suit, made three separate epistles out of it, <span
id="fr_444"></span>[4](#fn_444.md) an error all the more remarkable since
Bartholomew of Pisa in his *Conformities* (fruct. xii, P. 11, n. 47) and
before him Ubertino da Casale in the *Arbor Vitae* (l. v, c. vii, fol.
224) had edited the text correctly. Moreover, this useless division,
which is not called for by the context of the letter but is rather in
conflict with it, is not found in any of the early MS. collections
containing St. Francis’ writings.

The letter to all the Friars may be found in fourteen of the MSS.
mentioned above as containing the letter to all the Faithful, to wit,
those of Assisi, Düsseldorf,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Florence
(Ognissanti), St. Floriano, Foligno, Liegnitz, Munich, Oxford, Paris
(all three MSS.), and Rome (both MSS. at St. Isidore's and cod. 4354 of
the Vatican library). It is also contained in eight other codices: (1)
*Capistran* (munic. lib. cod. xxii, fol. 85 r); (2) *Freiburg* in
Switzerland (lib. ad Conventual Conv., cod. 23, 1. 60); (3) *Paris*
(nat. lib. cod. 18327, fol. 159 v); (4-5) *Subiaco* (monast. lib. cod.
120, fol. 325 and 212, fol. 184); (6-7) *Rome* (St. Antony's cod., fol.
61 r and 80 r, and Vatic. lib., cod. B. 82, fol. 147 v); (8) *Volterra*
(Guarnacci lib., cod. 225, fol. 151 r). Of these last named codices, the
two Roman MSS. and that of Volterra date from the fourteenth century;
the other five from the fifteenth.

For the Quaracchi text of the letter, which is here translated, the MSS.
of Assisi, <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_445.md) St. Antony's,
Ognissanti, and St. Isidore's, were collated with the versions of it
given in the *Arbor Vitae* (l. v, cap. vii, fol. 224 v), *Monumenta*
(fol. 231 v) and *Firmamenta* (fol. 21 r). <span
id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_446.md) It may be noted that in placing the
prayer, "Almighty, Eternal God," etc., at the end of the letter, the
Quaracchi editors have followed the order of the Assisian, Antonian,
Liegnitz, and both Mazarin MSS. <span id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_447.md)
But enough by the way of introduction to Letter II, which St. Francis
addressed:—

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

#### TO ALL THE FRIARS.

In the name of the Highest Trinity and Holy Unity of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. <span
id="fr_448"></span>[1](#fn_448.md)

To all the reverend and much beloved brothers, to <span
id="fr_449"></span>[2](#fn_449.md) the minister general of the Order of
Minors, its lord, and to the other ministers general who shall come
after him, and to all the ministers and custodes and priests of the same
brotherhood, humble in Christ, and to all the simple and obedient
brothers, the first and the last, Brother Francis, a mean and fallen
man, your little servant, gives greeting in Him who has redeemed and
washed us in His Precious Blood, <span id="fr_450"></span>[3](#fn_450.md)
and whom when you hear His Name adore ye with fear and reverence,
prostrate on the ground; <span id="fr_451"></span>[4](#fn_451.md) the Lord
Jesus Christ, such is the Name <span id="fr_452"></span>[5](#fn_452.md) of
the most High Son, blessed forever. Amen.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

Hear, my lords, my sons and my brothers, and with your ears receive my
words. <span id="fr_453"></span>[1](#fn_453.md) Incline the ear <span
id="fr_454"></span>[2](#fn_454.md) of your heart and obey the voice of the
Son of God. Keep His commandments with all your heart and fulfil His
counsels with a perfect mind. Praise Him for He is good <span
id="fr_455"></span>[3](#fn_455.md) and extol Him in your works, <span
id="fr_456"></span>[4](#fn_456.md) for therefore He has sent you through
all the world that by word and deed you may bear witness to His
voice, <span id="fr_457"></span>[5](#fn_457.md) and you may make known to
all that there is no other Almighty besides Him. <span
id="fr_458"></span>[6](#fn_458.md) Persevere under discipline <span
id="fr_459"></span>[7](#fn_459.md) and obedience and with a good and firm
purpose fulfil what you have promised Him. The Lord God offers Himself
to you as to His sons. <span id="fr_460"></span>[8](#fn_460.md)

Wherefore, brothers, kissing your feet and with the charity of which I
am capable, I conjure you all to show all reverence and all honor
possible to the most holy Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, in
whom the things that are in heaven and the things that are on earth are
pacified and reconciled to Almighty God. <span
id="fr_461"></span>[9](#fn_461.md) I also beseech in the Lord all my
brothers who are and shall be and desire to be priests <span
id="fr_462"></span>[10](#fn_462.md) of the Most High that, when they wish
to celebrate Mass, being pure, they offer the true Sacrifice

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ purely, with reverence,
with a holy and clean intention, not for any earthly thing or fear or
for the love of any man, as it were pleasing men. <span
id="fr_463"></span>[1](#fn_463.md) But let every will, in so far as the
grace of the Almighty helps, be directed to Him, <span
id="fr_464"></span>[2](#fn_464.md) desiring thence to please the High Lord
Himself alone because He alone works there \[in the Holy Sacrifice\] as
it may please Him, for He Himself says: "Do this for a commemoration of
Me;" <span id="fr_465"></span>[3](#fn_465.md) "if any one doth otherwise he
becomes the traitor Judas <span id="fr_466"></span>[4](#fn_466.md) and is
made guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord. <span
id="fr_467"></span>[5](#fn_467.md)

Call to mind, priests, my brothers, what is written in the law of Moses:
how those transgressing even materially died by the decree of the Lord
without any mercy. <span id="fr_468"></span>[6](#fn_468.md) How much more
and worse punishments he deserves to suffer "who hath trodden under foot
the Son of God and hath esteemed the Blood of the testament unclean by
which he was sanctified and hath offered an affront to the spirit of
grace." <span id="fr_469"></span>[7](#fn_469.md) For man despises, soils,
and treads under foot the Lamb of God when, as the Apostle says, <span
id="fr_470"></span>[8](#fn_470.md) not discerning and distinguishing the
holy bread of Christ from other nourishments or works, he

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

either eats unworthily or, if he be worthy, he eats in vain and
unbecomingly since the Lord has said by the prophet: Cursed be the man
that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully. <span
id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_471.md) And He condemns the priests who will not
take this to heart saying: "I will curse your blessings." <span
id="fr_472"></span>[2](#fn_472.md)

Hear ye, my brothers: If the Blessed Virgin Mary is so honored, as is
meet, because she bore Him in \[her\] most holy womb; if the blessed
Baptist trembled and did not dare to touch the holy forehead of God; if
the sepulchre in which He lay for some time, is venerated, how holy,
just, and worthy ought he to be who touches with his hands, who receives
with his heart and his mouth, and proffers to be received by others Him
who is now no more to die but to triumph in a glorified eternity: on
whom the angels desire to look. <span id="fr_473"></span>[3](#fn_473.md)

Consider your dignity, brothers, priests, and be holy because He Himself
is holy. <span id="fr_474"></span>[4](#fn_474.md) And as the Lord God has
honored you above all through this mystery, even so do you also love and
reverence and honor Him above all. It is a great misery and a deplorable
weakness when you have Him thus present to care for anything else in the
whole world. Let the entire man be seized with fear; let the whole world
tremble; let heaven exult when Christ, the Son of the Living God, is on
the altar in the hands of the priest. O admirable height and stupendous
condescension!

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O humble
sublimity! O sublime humility! that the Lord of the universe, God and
the Son of God, so humbles Himself that for our salvation He hides
Himself under a morsel of bread. Consider, brothers, the humility of God
and "pour out your hearts before Him, <span
id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_475.md) and be ye humbled that ye may be exalted
by Him. <span id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_476.md) Do not therefore keep back
anything for yourselves that He may receive you entirely who gives
Himself up entirely to you.

Wherefore I admonish and exhort in the Lord, that, in the places in
which the brothers live, only one Mass be celebrated in the day,
according to the form of holy Church. <span
id="fr_477"></span>[3](#fn_477.md) If, however, there be many priests in
the place, let one be contented, through love of charity, by hearing the
celebration of another priest, for the Lord Jesus Christ replenishes
those who are worthy of it, present and absent. He, although He may seem
to be present in many places, nevertheless remains undivided and suffers
no change; but One everywhere He works as it may please Him with the
Lord God the Father, and the

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Holy Ghost the
Paraclete, world without end. Amen.

And since "he that is of God heareth the words of God," <span
id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_478.md) we who have been more specially destined
for the divine offices, ought, in consequence, not only to hear and do
what God says, but also—in order to impress upon ourselves the greatness
of our Creator and our subjection to Him—to watch the vessels and other
objects which contain His holy words. On that account I warn all my
brothers and I strengthen them in Christ, wheresoever they may find the
divine written words to venerate them so far as they are able, and if
they are not well preserved or if they lie scattered disgracefully in
any place, let them, in so far as it concerns them, collect and preserve
them, honoring in the words the Lord who has spoken. For many things are
sanctified by the word of God, <span id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_479.md) and
by the power of the words of Christ the Sacrament of the Altar is
effected.

Moreover I confess all my sins to God the Father and to the Son and to
the Holy Ghost and to the Blessed Mary ever Virgin and to all the Saints
in heaven and on earth and to the minister general of this our religion
as to my venerable Lord, and to all the priests of our order and to all
my other blessed brothers. I have offended in many ways through my
grievous fault, especially because I have not observed the Rule which I
have promised to the Lord and

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I have not said
the office as prescribed by the Rule either by reason of my negligence
or weakness or because I am ignorant and simple. Wherefore, by all means
as far as I am able, I beseech my lord, the general minister, to cause
the Rule to be inviolably observed by all, and let the clerics say the
office with devotion before God, not attending to melody of voice but to
harmony of mind, so that the voice may be in accord with the mind and
the mind in accord with God, so that they may please God by purity of
mind and not coax the ears of the people by voluptuousness of voice. As
for myself I promise to keep these things strictly, as the Lord may give
me grace, and I leave them to the brothers who are with me to be
observed in the office and in the other appointed regulations. But
whosoever of the brothers will not observe them, I do not hold them as
Catholics or as my brothers and I do not wish either to see them or
speak \[with them\], until they have done penance. I say this also of
all others who setting aside the discipline of the Rule, go wandering
about; for our Lord Jesus Christ gave His life lest He might lose the
obedience of the most Holy Father. <span id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_480.md)

I, Brother Francis, a useless man and unworthy creature of the Lord God,
say to Brother Elias, the minister of our whole religion, by our Lord
Jesus Christ, and to all the ministers general who shall be after him
and to the other custodes

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

and guardians of the brothers, who are and shall be, that they have this
writing with them, put it in practice and [sedulously](errata.htm#4.md)
preserve it. And I entreat them to guard jealously those things which
are written in it and to cause them to be carefully observed according
to the good pleasure of the Almighty God now and ever as long as this
world may last.

Blessed be you by the Lord who shall have done these things and may the
Lord be with you forever. Amen.

Almighty, eternal, just, and merciful God, give to us wretches to do for
Thee what we know Thee to will and to will always that which is pleasing
to Thee; so that inwardly purified, inwardly illumined and kindled by
the flame of the Holy Ghost, we may be able to follow in the footsteps
of Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and by Thy grace alone come to Thee
the Most High, who in perfect Trinity and simple Unity livest and
reignest and gloriest God Almighty forever and ever. Amen. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_441"></span>[109:1](wosf13.htm#fr_441.md) So Ubertino da
Casale tells us in his *Arbor Vitae*, finished on Mount La Verna,
September 28, 1305 (l. v, cap. vii).

<span id="fn_442"></span>[109:2](wosf13.htm#fr_442.md) As we learn from the
rubric in the Assisi MS. 338: "De lictera et ammonitione beatissimi
patris nostri Francisci quam misit fratribus ad capitulum quando erat
infirmus."

<span id="fn_443"></span>[109:3](wosf13.htm#fr_443.md) *Hist. Seraph.*,

XII in his edition.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[110:1](wosf13.htm#fr_445.md) Following this MS.,
Mgr. Faloci edited the first part of the letter (to "world without end.
Amen,"—see page 116) in his Miss. Frances, t. VI, P. 94.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[110:2](wosf13.htm#fr_446.md) The *Mon.* and
*Firm.*, like Rodolfo (fol. 273 v), give only the first part of the
letter, which Wadding makes Epis. XII.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[110:3](wosf13.htm#fr_447.md) It is placed
immediately before the letter in the other family of MSS. mentioned in
the Introduction, to which the Ognissanti MS. belongs.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[111:1](wosf13.htm#fr_448.md) Cod. As. omits this
invocation.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[111:2](wosf13.htm#fr_449.md) Cod. As. adds "to
Brother *A*, minister general." It has been surmised that St. Francis
wished this letter to be read at the opening of all subsequent chapters,
with a view to perpetuating his spiritual presence among the brothers.
In this hypothesis, the copyist was supposed to fill in here the initial
of the minister general governing the order at the time he wrote. The
fact that *A* is the initial given at the head of the Assisian MS. may
afford a clue to the date of its composition (Albert of Pisa governed
the order 1239-40, and *A*ymon of Faversham, 1240-44), but in the body
of the letter (see below, [p. 117](#page_117).md) the minister general is
referred to as Brother *H* \[*H*elias (?) 1232-39\]. Cod. An. at the
head of the letter reads Brother *T* \[Thomas of Farignano (?),
1367-73\].

<span id="fn_477"></span>[115:3](wosf13.htm#fr_477.md) Philip Melanchthon
in his Apology (*Augsburg Confession*, art. on the Mass) usurped these
words of St. Francis to defend his erroneous teaching against private
Masses. But there is nothing in this letter or elsewhere to show that
St. Francis reprehended such Masses in any way. On the contrary, as the
Bollandists point out, the words "according to the form of holy Church"
refer to the rite of the Roman Church to be followed in the celebration
of Mass and not to the one Mass to be celebrated daily. (See *Acta
S.S.*, t. II, Oct., pp. 998-999).

<span id="fn_478"></span>[116:1](wosf13.htm#fr_478.md) John 8: 47.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[118:1](wosf13.htm#fr_481.md) This prayer, which,
as I have said, is found in some MSS. at the head and in others at the
foot of the present letter, is separated from it altogether by Wadding,
who (p. rot) places it immediately after the sheet given by St. Francis
to Brother Leo. There it is also found in the new French edition of the
*Opuscula* (p. 25).
