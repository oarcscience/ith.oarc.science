### III.

### TO A CERTAIN MINISTER.

The tenor of this letter seems to indicate that it was written before
the confirmation of the Second Rule by Pope Honorius; <span
id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_482.md) and very likely in the early part of
1223. All the early MSS. attribute it to St. Francis and, as regards
both matter and form, it closely resembles the Saint's other writings.
There is, however, no small diversity of opinion as to whom it was
addressed. But from the wording of the last paragraph of the letter,
referring to the chapter: "thou wilt be there with thy brothers," it
would appear to have been sent to some provincial minister rather than
to the minister general. Moreover, as Professor Goetz rightly
remarks, <span id="fr_483"></span>[2](#fn_483.md) the beginning of the
letter implies that this minister had proposed some doubts or
difficulties as to the manner of dealing with brothers who had fallen
into sin. Hence the abrupt opening of the letter, "I speak to thee on
the subject of thy soul," etc., refers to some question which the letter
is intended to answer, and from the fact that patience is commended
"more than a hermitage," the Quaracchi editors think we might infer that
the minister in question was desirous of embracing a solitary life. Be
this as it may, I am unable to

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

agree with M. Sabatier in so far as he finds in this letter "more
objurgations and reproaches than counsels." <span
id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_484.md)

The letter exists in the Vatican MS. 7650, St. Isidore's MS. 1/25 and
the Ognissanti and St. Floriano codices above described. The first part
of it may also be found in the National Library at Naples (Cod. XII, F.
32). An abridgment of the Letter is given by Rodolfo; <span
id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_485.md) a different abstract is found in the
*Conformities*. <span id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_486.md) In the more
complete summary furnished by Wadding, <span
id="fr_487"></span>[4](#fn_487.md) it might be possible with M.
Sabatier <span id="fr_488"></span>[5](#fn_488.md), and Dr. Lempp, <span
id="fr_489"></span>[6](#fn_489.md) owing to the omission of a large piece
of the letter, to read into St. Francis’ words the precept that a
brother guilty of mortal sin should be absolved without any penance. But
with the full text of the letter before us, any such attempt is,
needless to say, impossible, as Mr. Carmichael has clearly shown. <span
id="fr_490"></span>[7](#fn_490.md)

The complete text of this important letter was first

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

published by Fr. Edouard d’Alençon, Archivist General of the Capuchins,
in his *Spicilegium Franciscanum*, <span id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_491.md)
next by M. Sabatier in his edition of Bartholi, <span
id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_492.md) and again by Dr. Lempp in his monograph
on Elias. <span id="fr_493"></span>[3](#fn_493.md) Besides these we have
now the versions of Professor Boehmer and the Quaracchi edition. The
latter text, which I have here rendered into English, is based on the
MSS. of Ognissanti and St. Isidore's (cod. 1/25) which have been
collated with the Neapolitan MS. already referred to and the editions of
the letter published by Fr. Edouard d’Alençon and M. Sabatier.

Now for the text of the letter

#### TO A CERTAIN MINISTER. <span id="fr_494"></span>[4](#fn_494.md)

*To Brother N. . . Minister; may Me Lord bless thee*.

I speak to thee as best I can on the subject of thy soul; that those
things which impede thee

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

in loving the Lord God and whosoever may be a hindrance to thee, whether
brothers or others, even though they were to strike thee,—all these
things thou oughtest to reckon as a favor. And so thou shouldst desire
and not otherwise. And let this be to thee for true obedience from the
Lord God and from me; for this I know surely to be true obedience. And
love those that do such things to thee and wish not other from them,
save in so far as the Lord may grant to thee; and in this thing love
them,—by wishing that they may be better Christians. <span
id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_495.md) And let this be to thee more than a
hermitage. <span id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_496.md) And by this I wish to
know if thou lovest God and me His servant and thine, to wit: that there
be no brother in the world who has sinned, how great soever his sin may
be, who after he has seen thy face shall ever go away without thy mercy,
if he seek mercy, <span id="fr_497"></span>[3](#fn_497.md) and, if he seek
not mercy, ask

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

thou him if he desires mercy. And if he afterwards appears <span
id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_498.md) before thy face a thousand times, love
him more than me, to the end that thou mayest draw him to the Lord, and
on such ones always have mercy. And this thou shouldst declare to the
guardians, when thou canst, that thou art determined of thyself to do
thus.

Concerning all the chapters that are in the Rule that speak of mortal
sins <span id="fr_499"></span>[2](#fn_499.md) we shall at the chapter of
Whitsuntide, God helping, with the counsel of the brothers, make such a
chapter as this: If any brother, at the instigation of the enemy, sin
mortally, let him be bound by obedience to have recourse to his
guardian. And let all the brothers who know him to have sinned, not
cause him shame or slander him, but let them have great mercy on him and
keep very secret the sin of their brother, for they that are healthy
need not a physician, but they that are ill. <span
id="fr_500"></span>[3](#fn_500.md) And let them be likewise bound by
obedience to send him to his custos with a companion. And let the custos
himself care for him mercifully as he himself would wish to be cared for
by others if he were in a like situation.

\[And if he should fall into any <span id="fr_501"></span>[4](#fn_501.md)
venial sin, let him confess to his brother priest, and if there be no
priest there let him confess to his brother, until he shall find a
priest who shall absolve him

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

canonically, as has been said,\] <span id="fr_502"></span>[1](#fn_502.md)
and let them have absolutely no power of enjoining other penance save
only this: go and sin no more. <span id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_503.md)

In order that this writing may be able to be better observed, have it by
thee until Whitsuntide: thou wilt be there with thy brothers. And these
and all other things which are less in the Rule, thou shalt, the Lord
God helping, take care to fulfil.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_482"></span>[119:1](wosf14.htm#fr_482.md) It refers to "the
chapters which speak of mortal sin" which are only found in the First
Rule (see pp. [37](wosf06.htm#page_37), [47](wosf06.htm#page_47.md),
[53](wosf06.htm#page_53).md), and speaks of proposed changes in the Rule
which could not, as is clear, have been made after November, 1223. In
particular the subject of the tenth chapter of the new Rule discussed in
the Chapter held at Portiuncula, June 11th of that year (see *Spec.
Perf.*, ed. Sabatier, c. t), is mentioned as not yet definitely settled.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[119:2](wosf14.htm#fr_483.md) See *Quellen*, etc
t. XXII, p. 547.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[120:1](wosf14.htm#fr_484.md) " . . . plus des
objurgations et des reproches que des conseils."—Sabatier, Bartholi, p.
120.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[120:2](wosf14.htm#fr_485.md) *Hist. Seraph.*,
fol. 177 v.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[120:3](wosf14.htm#fr_486.md) Fruct. XXII, P. 11,
n. 46. The part here given is that which Wadding exhibits as Epis. VI.
M. Sabatier is clearly mistaken in regarding these different abstracts
of the letter published separately as so many complete epistles. He
says: ". . Frère Elie ne se corrigeant pas, le saint ne cessa pas de lui
faire des recommendations identiques," *l.c.*, p. 119.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[120:4](wosf14.htm#fr_487.md) See Epis. VIII. This
is a different and longer version than that given in the *Conformities*.
Wadding gives yet another abstract of the letter as Epis. VII. This he
translated from the Spanish, though he confesses misgivings as to the
authenticity of its form.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[120:5](wosf14.htm#fr_488.md) See his edition of
Bartholi, pp. 113-131.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[120:6](wosf14.htm#fr_489.md) See *Frère Elie de
Cortone*, p. 51, where the idea of abolishing penances is described as
"so Franciscan."

<span id="fn_490"></span>[120:7](wosf14.htm#fr_490.md) See "The Writings of
St. Francis," in the *Month*, January, 1904, pp. 161-164.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[121:1](wosf14.htm#fr_491.md) In 1899; after the
Vatican MS. 7650, and the Foligno codex. See *Epistola S. Francisci ad
ministrum generalem in sua forma authentica cum appendice de Fr. Petro
Catanii*.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[121:2](wosf14.htm#fr_492.md) In 1900, after the
Ognissanti MS. See his Bartholi, p. 113.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[121:3](wosf14.htm#fr_493.md) In 1900. See his
*Frère Elie de Cortone*, p. 50 seq.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[121:4](wosf14.htm#fr_494.md) This is the
superscription of the Neapolitan MS. According to the greater number of
codices the letter is addressed: "To Brother N . . . Minister." The MSS.
of Foligno and St. Isidore's read: "To Brother N . . . Minister
General," and some Italian versions cited by M. Sabatier (see Bartholi,
p. 121, note 1) add the name of Brother Elias (see also Rodolfo, *l.c.*,
fol. 177 v.). The rubric in the second family of MSS. already described
(See Introd.) reads simply "Letter which St. Francis sent to the
Minister General as to the way to be followed regarding brother subjects
sinning mortally or venially." Wadding (*Opusc.*, p. 25, n. 1) thinks
the letter was addressed to Peter of Catana. See *Speculum Minorum*,
fol. 218 v.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[122:1](wosf14.htm#fr_495.md) For the rendering of
this doubtful passage: *et in hoc dilige eos ut velis quod sint meliores
Christiani*, I have translated the Latin text as given in the Isidorean
MS. 1/25, in the *Conformities* (fol. 132, v), in Wadding's edition
(Epis. VIII), and in that of Quaracchi (p. 108). In the Ognissanti MS.,
however, this passage reads *et non velis* "and do *not* desire that
they be better Christians." This reading has been followed by Fr.
Edouard d’Alençon and M. Sabatier. The latter thinks St. Francis is here
referring to ungrateful and recalcitrant lepers whom he was wont to call
Christians. But in that hypothesis the passage might be translated "and
do not desire to make them better lepers!"

<span id="fn_496"></span>[122:2](wosf14.htm#fr_496.md) Cod. O. for
*eremitorium* reads *meritorium*. But may not this very improbable
reading be that most common thing in early MSS.,—the slip of a copyist?

<span id="fn_497"></span>[122:3](wosf14.htm#fr_497.md) Cod. O. omits the
remainder of this sentence.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[123:1](wosf14.htm#fr_498.md) The Neapolitan MS.
for "appears" reads "sins."

<span id="fn_499"></span>[123:2](wosf14.htm#fr_499.md) Chaps. V, XIII, and
XX of the first Rule. (See above, pp. [37](wosf06.htm#page_37.md),
[47](wosf06.htm#page_47), and [53](wosf06.htm#page_53)..md)

<span id="fn_500"></span>[123:3](wosf14.htm#fr_500.md) See Matt. 9: 12.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[123:4](wosf14.htm#fr_501.md) Cod. O. reads:
"another."

<span id="fn_502"></span>[124:1](wosf14.htm#fr_502.md) In chap. XX of the
First Rule (see above, [p. 53](wosf06.htm#page_53).md). The passage
enclosed in brackets is the part omitted by Wadding and those who have
followed him.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[124:2](wosf14.htm#fr_503.md) See John 8: 11.
