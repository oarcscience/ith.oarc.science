### VI.

### TO BROTHER LEO.

The authenticity of this letter cannot be challenged. The original
autograph is jealously preserved at the Cathedral of Spoleto. In
Wadding's time it was kept at the Conventual church in that place, but
subsequently disappeared in some way and there was no trace of it until
1895, when Father Cardinali, a priest of Spoleto, placed it in the hands
of Mgr. Faloci. The latter presented it to Pope Leo XIII and, after
reposing for some three years in the Vatican, it was, at the request of
Mgr. Serafini, Archbishop of Spoleto, returned to the cathedral
there. <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_516.md) Only one other autograph of
St. Francis is known to exist. <span id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_517.md) The
scope of the letter is obvious: it is a word of tender encouragement and
counsel to the *Frate pecorello de Dio*, St. Francis’ most intimate
companion and friend, who at the time was harassed with doubts and
fears. The form of the letter seems to present some difficulties to
certain critics. For example, St. Francis at the outset uses the words:
*F. Leo F. Francisco tuo salutem et pacem*. It is, of course, clear that
this superscription cannot be interpreted in such a way as to make
Brother Leo the author of the letter; in that case it would be
*Francisco suo*, and no one, so far as I know, has ever attempted this
violence to the text. But there have been some who, thinking St. Francis
did not know the difference between a dative and a nominative,

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

have not hesitated to tamper with the text so as to bring the Latin of
the *Poverello* into conformity with what they think to be better
grammar. <span id="fr_518"></span>[1](#fn_518.md) I confess that .I find no
difficulty in translating the superscription as it stands in the
original autograph. As a general rule, no doubt, it is the sender of a
letter that greets the one to whom it is sent. But, in this case, the
humility of St. Francis has led him to change parts and he appeals for a
blessing instead of bestowing one. I find myself therefore in thorough
accord with Mr. Carmichael's clever solution of this question and agree
with him that St. Francis, always imaginative, meant what he wrote, and
that "there is really a deep, sweet, and most pathetic meaning in the
Saint's peculiar mode of address." Accordingly, the superscription ought
to read "Brother Leo, wish thy brother Francis health and peace." It is
thus, following Mr. Carmichael, that I have translated it here.

As regards the use of the plural (*faciatis*) in the body of the note
which perplexed Wadding, since the singular seems to be called for, some
think with the Quaracchi editors that the Saint, writing so familiarly
to Leo, adopts the Italian form; others, with M. Sabatier, <span
id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_519.md) that Brother Leo had spoken in the name
of a group. Perhaps it may not be amiss to recall in this connection,
what Celano tells us of St. Francis’ method of composition <span
id="fr_520"></span>[3](#fn_520.md) as well as of the letter

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

of the Saint mentioned by Eccleston, in which there was faulty
Latin. <span id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_521.md) A French critic <span
id="fr_522"></span>[2](#fn_522.md) thinks we might perhaps be justified in
identifying the letter referred to by Eccleston with the one to Brother
Leo now under consideration. Be this as it may, the context of the
present letter leads one to suppose that at the time it was written
Brother Leo was not yet habitually with St. Francis. In this hypothesis,
we must fix the date of its composition not later than 1220. <span
id="fr_523"></span>[3](#fn_523.md) It need not be wondered at if, after
nearly seven centuries, some words in the autograph letter preserved at
Spoleto are difficult to read. Hence some trifling variants occur in the
texts published by Wadding <span id="fr_524"></span>[4](#fn_524.md) and
Faloci. <span id="fr_525"></span>[5](#fn_525.md) The Quaracchi text which I
have here translated is edited after the original:—

#### TO BROTHER LEO.

Brother Leo, wish thy brother Francis health and peace!

I say to thee: Yes, my son, and as a mother; for in this word and
counsel I sum up briefly all the words we said on the way, and if
afterwards thou hast need to come to me for advice, thus I advise you:
In whatever way it seemeth best to thee to please the Lord God and to
follow His

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

footsteps and poverty, so do with the blessing of the Lord God and in my
obedience. And if it be necessary for thee on account of thy soul or
other consolation and thou wishest, Leo, to come to me, come! <span
