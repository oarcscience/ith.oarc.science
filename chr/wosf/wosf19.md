### II.

### SALUTATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

This little prayer enjoys the same title to authenticity as the
preceding opuscule, and Professor Boehmer <span
id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_542) and M. Sabatier <span
id="fr_543"></span>[2](#fn_543) are in complete accord with the
Quaracchi editors as to its genuinity. With the exception of the Assisi
codex, it is found in all the early MS. collections containing the
Praises. The text here translated is based on the MS. at Ognissanti and
St. Isidore's (1/25), which were collated by the Quaracchi editors with
the versions given in the *Conformities* (fruct. xii, P. II, c. v.) and
the *Speculum B. Francisci* (ed. 1 and 2, fol. 127 r).

#### SALUTATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN. <span id="fr_544"></span>[3](#fn_544)

Hail, holy Lady, most holy Queen, Mother of God, Mary who art ever
Virgin, chosen from Heaven by the most Holy Father, whom He has
consecrated with the most holy beloved Son and the Ghostly Paraclete, in
whom was and is all the fulness of grace and all good. Hail thou His
palace! <span id="fr_545"></span>[4](#fn_545) Hail thou His
tabernacle.! <span id="fr_546"></span>[5](#fn_546) Hail thou His house.
Hail thou His garment! Hail thou His handmaid! Hail thou His Mother and
all ye holy virtues which by the grace and

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

illumination of the Holy Ghost thou infusest in the heart of the
faithful, that from infidels ye mayest make them faithful to God. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_542"></span>[143:1](wosf19.htm#fr_542) *Analekten*, p.
xxvii.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[143:2](wosf19.htm#fr_543) *Opuscules*, fasc.
x, p. 134.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[143:3](wosf19.htm#fr_544) The text given by
Wadding (*Opusc*., p. 105) was copied by him from an Irish MS. at
Salamanca.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[143:4](wosf19.htm#fr_545) Cod. Is. omits from
"Hail thou His tabernacle" to "Hail thou His handmaid," inclusive.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[143:5](wosf19.htm#fr_546) Wadding omits from
"Hail thou His house" to " Hail thou His handmaid," inclusive.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[144:1](wosf19.htm#fr_547) The text of the
*Conformities* and Wadding here add the second part of the antiphon
given below in the Office of the Passion beginning "Mother of our most
Holy Lord Jesus Christ," etc. In the *Speculum* (ed. Morin, 1509) this
Salutation is followed by another prayer to the Blessed Virgin (see
Sabatier, *Opuscules*, fasc. x, p. 164); but from the beginning of the
seventeenth century, the second prayer is no longer found in the text of
the *Speculum* (see the edition of Spoelberch, P. I, pp. 176-178, and
Wadding, *Opusc.*, p. 107). In the opinion of Professor Boehmer this
Salutation ought to follow immediately after the Salutation of the
Virtues given above ([p. 20](wosf04.htm#page_20)). See his *Analekten*,
pp. vi and xxviii. They are found in this order in the *Spec. Vitae* of
3504 and the Vatican MS. 4354.
