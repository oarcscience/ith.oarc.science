### SECOND RULE OF THE FRIARS MINOR. <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_289.md)

1.—*In the Name of the Lord begins the life of the Minor Brothers*.

The Rule and life of the Minor Brothers is this, namely, to observe the
holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, by living in obedience, without
property and in chastity. Brother Francis promises obedience and
reverence to the Lord Pope Honorius and to his successors canonically
elected and to the Roman Church. And let the other brothers be bound to
obey Brother Francis and his successors.

2.—*Of those who wish to embrace this Life and how they ought to be
received*.

If any wish to embrace this life and come to our brothers, let them send
them to their provincial

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

ministers, to whom alone and not to others is accorded the power of
receiving brothers. But let the ministers diligently examine them
regarding the Catholic faith and the Sacraments of the Church. And if
they believe all these things, and if they will confess them faithfully
and observe them firmly to the end, and if they have no wives, or, if
they have and their wives have already entered a monastery, or have,
with the authority of the diocesan bishop, given them permission after
having made a vow of continence, and if the wives be of such an age that
no suspicion may arise concerning them, let them \[the ministers\] say
to them the word of the holy Gospel, <span
id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_290.md) that they go and sell all their goods
and strive to distribute them to the poor. If they should not be able to
do this, their good will suffices. And the brothers and their ministers
must take care not to be solicitous about their temporal affairs, that
they may freely do with their affairs whatsoever the Lord may inspire
them. If, however, counsel should be required, the ministers shall have
power of sending them to some God-fearing men by whose advice their
goods may be distributed to the poor. Afterwards, let them give them
clothes of probation, to wit, two tunics without a hood and a cord and
breeches and a chaperon reaching to the cord, unless at some time the
same ministers may decide otherwise according to God. The year of
probation being finished, they shall be received

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

to obedience, promising to observe always this life and rule. And
according to the command of the Lord Pope <span
id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_291.md) in no wise shall it be allowed them to
go out of this religion, because, according to the holy Gospel: "No man
putting his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom
of God." <span id="fr_292"></span>[2](#fn_292.md) And let those who have
already promised obedience have one tunic with a hood, and if they wish
it another without a hood. And those who are obliged by necessity may
wear shoes. And let all the brothers be clothed in poor garments and
they may patch them with pieces of sackcloth and other things, with the
blessing of God. I admonish and exhort them not to despise or judge men
whom they see clothed in fine and showy garments using dainty meats and
drinks, but rather let each one judge and despise himself.

3.—*Of the Divine Office, and of Fasting; and how the Brothers must go
through the world*.

Let the clerics perform the Divine Office according to the order of the
holy Roman Church, with the exception of the Psalter; wherefore they may
have breviaries. <span id="fr_293"></span>[3](#fn_293.md) But let the laics
say twenty-four *Paternosters* for Matins; five for

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lauds; for Prime,
Tierce, Sext and Nones,—for each of these, seven; for Vespers, however,
twelve, for Compline seven; and let them pray for the dead.

And let them fast from the feast of All Saints until the Nativity of the
Lord. But the holy Lent which begins from Epiphany and continues for
forty days, which the Lord has consecrated by His holy fast, <span
id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_294.md)—may those who keep it voluntarily be
blessed by the Lord and those who do not wish may not be constrained.
But they must fast during the other one until the Resurrection of the
Lord. At other times, however, they shall not be obliged to fast, except
on Fridays. But in time of manifest necessity the brothers shall not be
bound to corporal fasting.

I indeed counsel, warn, and exhort my brothers in the Lord Jesus Christ
that when they go through the world they be not litigious nor contend in
words, <span id="fr_295"></span>[2](#fn_295.md) nor judge others; but that
they be gentle, peaceful, and modest, meek and humble, speaking honestly
to all as is fitting. And they must not ride on horseback unless
compelled by manifest necessity or infirmity. Into whatsoever house they
may enter let them first say: Peace be to this house! And, according to
the holy Gospel, it is lawful to eat of all foods which are set before
them. <span id="fr_296"></span>[3](#fn_296.md)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

4.—*That the Brothers must not receive money*.

I strictly enjoin on all the brothers that in no wise they receive coins
or money, either themselves or through an interposed person.
Nevertheless, for the necessities of the sick and for clothing the other
brothers, let the ministers and custodes alone take watchful care
through spiritual friends, according to places and times and cold
climates, as they shall see expedient in the necessity, saving always'
that, as has been said, they shall not receive coins or money.

5.—*Of the manner of working*.

Let those brothers to whom the Lord has given the grace of working labor
faithfully and devoutly, so that in banishing idleness, the enemy of the
soul, they do not extinguish the spirit of holy prayer and devotion, to
which all temporal things must be subservient. They may, however,
receive as the reward of their labor, the things needful for the body
for themselves and their brothers, with the exception of coins or money,
and that humbly, as befits the servants of God and the followers of most
holy poverty.

6.—*That the Brothers shall appropriate nothing to themselves: and of
seeking Alms and of the Sick Brothers*.

The brothers shall appropriate nothing to themselves, neither a house
nor place nor any-

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

thing. And as pilgrims and strangers <span
id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_297.md) in this world, serving the Lord in
poverty and humility, let them go confidently in quest of alms, nor
ought they to be ashamed, because the Lord made Himself poor for us in
this world. This, my dearest brothers, is the height of the most sublime
poverty which has made you heirs and kings of the kingdom of heaven:
poor in goods, but exalted in virtue. Let that be your portion, for it
leads to the land of the living; <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_298.md)
cleaving to it unreservedly, my best beloved brothers, for the Name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, never desire to possess anything else under
heaven.

And wheresoever the brothers are and may find themselves, let them
mutually show among themselves that they are of one household. And let
one make known his needs with confidence to the other, for, if a mother
nourishes and loves her carnal son, how much more earnestly ought one to
love and nourish his spiritual brother! And if any of them should fall
into illness, the other brothers must serve him as they would wish to be
served themselves.

7.—*Of the Penance to be imposed on Brothers who sin*.

If any of the brothers, at the instigation of the enemy, sin mortally by
those sins for which it has been ordained among the brothers that

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

recourse should be had to the provincial ministers alone, the aforesaid
brothers are bound to have recourse to them as soon as possible, without
delay. But let the ministers themselves, if they are priests, impose
penance on them with mercy; if however they are not priests, let them
have it imposed by other priests of the Order, as it may seem to them
most expedient, according to God. And they must beware lest they be
angry or troubled on account of the sins of others, because anger and
trouble impede charity themselves and in others.

8.—*Of the Election of the Minister General of this Brotherhood, and of
the Whitsun Chapter*.

All the brothers are bound always to have one of the brothers of this
religion as minister general and servant of the whole brotherhood, and
they are strictly bound to obey him. At his death the election of a
successor must be made by the provincial ministers and custodes in the
Whitsun Chapter, in which the provincial ministers are always bound to
convene at the same time, wheresoever it may be appointed by the
minister general, and that once in three years or at a longer or shorter
interval as may be ordained by the said minister. And if at any time it
should be apparent to the whole of the provincial ministers that the
aforesaid minister general is not sufficient for the service and the
common welfare of the brothers, let the

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

aforesaid ministers, to whom the election has been committed, be bound
to elect for themselves another as custos in the name of the Lord. But
after the Whitsun Chapter the ministers and custodes may each, if they
wish and it seem expedient to them, convoke their brothers to a chapter
in  their custodies once in the same year.

9.—*Of Preachers*.

The brothers must not preach in the diocese of any bishop when their
doing so may be opposed by him. And let no one of the brothers dare to
preach in any way to the people, unless he has been examined and
approved by the minister general of this brotherhood, and the office of
preaching conceded to him by the latter. I also warn and exhort the same
brothers that in the preaching they do their words be fire-tried and
pure <span id="fr_299"></span>[1](#fn_299.md) for the utility and
edification of the people, announcing to them vices and virtues,
punishment and glory, with brevity of speech because the Lord made His
word short upon earth. <span id="fr_300"></span>[2](#fn_300.md)

10.—*Of the Admonition and Correction of the Brothers*.

Those brothers who are ministers and servants of the other brothers,
shall visit and admonish their brothers, and shall humbly and charitably
correct them, not commanding them

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

anything against their souls and our Rule. The brothers however who are
subject must remember that, for God, they have renounced their own will.
Wherefore I order them strictly to obey their ministers in all things
which they have promised the Lord to observe and are not against their
souls and our Rule. And wheresoever there are brothers who see and know
that they are not able to observe the rule spiritually, they ought to
and can recur to their ministers. And let the ministers receive them
charitably and kindly and show so great familiarity toward them that
they \[the culprits\] may speak and act with them as masters with their
servants, for thus it ought to be, since the ministers are the servants
of all the brothers.

I also warn and exhort the brothers in the Lord Jesus Christ that they
beware of all pride, vainglory, envy, covetousness, <span
id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_301.md) the cares and solicitudes of this world,
of detraction and murmuring. Let not those who are ignorant of letters
care to learn letters, but let them consider that, beyond all, they
should desire to possess the spirit of the Lord and His holy operation,
to pray always to Him with a pure heart and to have humility, patience
in persecution and in infirmity and to love those who persecute,
reprove, and accuse us, because the Lord has said: "Love your enemies .
. . and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you." <span
id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_302.md) "Blessed are they that suffer
persecution

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

for justice’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." <span
id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_303.md) "But he that shall persevere to the end,
he shall be saved." <span id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_304.md)

11.—*That the Brothers must not enter the Monasteries of Nuns*.

I strictly command all the brothers not to have suspicious intimacy, or
conferences with women, and let none enter the monasteries of nuns
except those to whom special permission has been granted by the
Apostolic See. And let them not be godfathers of men or women,
that <span id="fr_305"></span>[3](#fn_305.md) scandal may not arise on this
account among the brothers or concerning the brothers.

12.—*Of those who go among the Saracens and other Infidels*.

Let all of the brothers who by divine inspiration desire to go amongst
the Saracens or other infidels, ask leave therefor from their provincial
ministers. But the ministers must give permission to go to none except
to those whom they see are fitted to be sent.

Moreover, I enjoin on the ministers, by obedience, that they ask of the
Lord Pope one of the Cardinals of the holy Roman Church to be governor,
protector, and corrector of this

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

brotherhood, so that being always subject and submissive at the feet of
the same holy Church, grounded in the Catholic faith, <span
id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_306.md) we may observe poverty and humility and
the holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which we have firmly promised.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[64:1](wosf07.htm#fr_289.md) This is the text of
1223 and represents the Rule at present observed throughout the first
Franciscan Order. It is here translated according to the text of the
original Bull which is preserved at the Sacro Convento in Assisi. A
duplicate of this document, contained in the Pontifical Register at the
Vatican Library, has been consulted for certain passages less legible in
the original.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[66:3](wosf07.htm#fr_293.md) This passage: *ex quo
habere poterunt breviaria*, may also be rendered: "as soon as they can
have breviaries." (See Wadding, *Opusc.*, p. 179.) But the latter
translation has less foundation.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[73:3](wosf07.htm#fr_305.md) This is comformable
to the original bull, which reads *nec hac occasione;* but most of the
printed texts give ne, "lest scandal arise," Instead of *nec*.
