### VII.

### OF LIVING RELIGIOUSLY IN A HERMITAGE.

We learn from St. Bonaventure <span id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_354.md) and
the *Fioretti* <span id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_355.md) that as companions
began to flock to St. Francis, the man of God hesitated for a while
between adopting a life of prayer or of preaching. Although, as we know,
he finally decided in favor of the apostolate, yet withal he never
altogether separated the contemplative from the active life. A precious
witness to this fact is found in the Regulation for the brothers during
their sojourn in hermitages with which we are now concerned. To
understand the scope of this peculiar piece of legislation, it must be
borne in mind that at the beginning of the Franciscan movement the
friars had no settled domicile. <span id="fr_356"></span>[3](#fn_356.md)
The wide world was their cloister. <span id="fr_357"></span>[4](#fn_357.md)
Possessing nothing they wandered about like children careless of the
day, teaching or preaching, passing the night in hay-lofts or under
church

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

porches, in lazarettos, or deserted huts and grottoes. <span
id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_358.md) The need of having some kind of
permanent retreat where they might retire at times to pray or rest,
resulted in the institution of hermitages. These little solitudes, to
which Francis loved to withdraw, may be found wherever the Saint went.
The Celle near Cortina, the Careen on Mount Subasio, Greccio in the
valley of Rieti, and the more solitary hermitages, like Lo Speco, form,
as some one has said, a series of documents, about St. Francis’ life,
quite as important as the written ones. And not a little of his spirit
still lingers in such of these hermitages as yet remain. It was for the
government of small *loci* <span id="fr_359"></span>[2](#fn_359.md) like
these that the present special little Rule was written. Its attribution
to St. Francis has not been questioned. The quaint simplicity of its
conception proclaims its authenticity, and in none of the codices does
it bear the name of any other author than St. Francis. It may have been
written about 1217; its composition certainly belongs to the first
decade of. the Order.

In the ancient collections of St. Francis’ writings found in the codices
at Florence (Ognissanti), Foligno, Rome (St. Isidore's MS. 1/25 and the
Vatican MS. 7650), as well as in copies of the compilation which begins
*Fac secundum exemplar*, this Instruction is found at the end of the
Admonitions. But in the greater number of the early Codices the
Admonitions close as in the present translation, and the

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

opuscule on hermitages is preferably separated from them, as it is in
the Assisian codex and that of St. Isidore's, Rome (MS. 1/73). The text
which follows is based on the Assisi MS., which has been collated with
that of Ognissanti and those at St. Isidore's and with the version of
this Regulation given by Bartholomew of Pisa in his
*Conformities*. <span id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_360.md) Here is the text:

#### OF LIVING RELIGIOUSLY IN A HERMITAGE.

Let those who wish to live religiously in hermitages, be three brothers
or four at most. Let two of them be mothers and have two sons, or at
least one. Let the two former lead the life of Martha and the other two
the life of Mary Magdalene. <span id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_361.md)

Let those who lead the life of Mary have one cloister <span
id="fr_362"></span>[3](#fn_362.md) and each his own place, so that they may
not live or sleep together. And let them always say Compline of the day
toward sunset, <span id="fr_363"></span>[4](#fn_363.md) and let them be
careful to keep silence and to say their Hours and to rise for Matins,
and let them

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

seek first "the kingdom of God and His justice." <span
id="fr_364"></span>[1](#fn_364.md) And let them say Prime and Tierce at the
proper time, and, after the hour of Tierce, they may break silence and
may speak and, when it is pleasing to them, they may go to their mothers
and may ask an alms from them for the love of the Lord God, like little
poor ones. <span id="fr_365"></span>[2](#fn_365.md) And after that, let
them say Sext and Nones and Vespers at the appointed time.

And they must not allow any <span id="fr_366"></span>[3](#fn_366.md) person
to enter into the cloister where they live, or let them eat there. Let
those brothers who are mothers endeavor to keep apart from every person
and, by the obedience of their custos, let them guard their sons from
every person, so that no one may speak with them. And let these sons not
speak with any person except with their mothers and with their custos,
when it shall please him to visit them with the blessing of God. <span
id="fr_367"></span>[4](#fn_367.md) But the sons must sometimes in turn
assume the office of mothers, for a time, according as it may seem to
them to dispose. Let them strive to observe all the above diligently and
earnestly. <span id="fr_368"></span>[5](#fn_368.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_354"></span>[87:1](wosf10.htm#fr_354.md) See Bonav. *Leg.
Maj.*, XII, 1, where the Saint is represented as discoursing on the
relative merits and advantages of the active and contemplative life.
Wadding gives this discourse among the Monastic Conferences he
attributes to St. Francis. See *Opuscula*, Coll. XIV, p. 318.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[87:2](wosf10.htm#fr_355.md) See *Floretum S.
Francisci*, ed. Sabatier, cap. 16, p. 60. This chapter, which is one of
the most interesting from a critical point of view, represents St.
Francis as consulting St. Clare and Brother Sylvester on the subject of
his doubt.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[87:3](wosf10.htm#fr_356.md) See First Rule, chap.
vii (above, [p. 40](wosf06.htm#page_40).md); also *Speculum Perf.*, ed.
Sabatier, pp. 25-26.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[87:4](wosf10.htm#fr_357.md) As is most poetically
described by the author of the *Sacrum Commercium*. Show me your
cloister, asks the Lady Poverty of the friars. And they, leading her to
the summit of a hill, showed her the wide world, saying: This is our
cloister, O Lady Poverty. (See *The Lady Poverty*, by M. Carmichael, p.
128.)

<span id="fn_358"></span>[88:1](wosf10.htm#fr_358.md) See 1 Cel. 1, 17; and
*Leg. III Soc.* 55. Such grottoes may still be seen in St. Francis’
country; they serve as a shelter for beggars and gypsies.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[88:2](wosf10.htm#fr_359.md) St. Francis
habitually uses the word *locus* or place to designate the habitations
of the friars (see above, Rule II, chap. vi, p. 68).

<span id="fn_360"></span>[89:1](wosf10.htm#fr_360.md) See "Franciscus in
admonitionibus suis" (fruct. xii, P. 11, cap. 30). It was from this text
that Wadding took the Regulation for his edition of the *Opuscula* in
which it figures under the heading *Collationes Monasticae III*.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[89:2](wosf10.htm#fr_361.md) The figure which
presents Mary and Martha as types of the contemplative and active life
was already a familiar one. See Gregor., *VI Moral.*, c. 37, n. 61:
"Quid per Mariam, quae verba Domini residens audiebat, nisi
contemplativa vita exprimitur? Quid per Martham exterioribus obsequiis
occu patam nisi activa vita signatur?"

<span id="fn_362"></span>[89:3](wosf10.htm#fr_362.md) Cod. As. after
cloister reads: "in which each one shall have his own cell."

<span id="fn_363"></span>[89:4](wosf10.htm#fr_363.md) Cod. As. reads:
"immediately after sunset."

<span id="fn_364"></span>[90:1](wosf10.htm#fr_364.md) Luke 12: 31.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[90:2](wosf10.htm#fr_365.md) This is the reading
of the Cod. As. and Is.; other texts read the "poorest beggars."

<span id="fn_366"></span>[90:3](wosf10.htm#fr_366.md) Cod. O. adds: "any
woman or person whatsoever."

<span id="fn_367"></span>[90:4](wosf10.htm#fr_367.md) The text in Cod. As.
ends here.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[90:5](wosf10.htm#fr_368.md) See 2 Cel. 3, 113.
