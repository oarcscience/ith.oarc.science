### V.

### FRAGMENTS FROM THE RULE OF THE SISTERS OF ST. CLARE.

Of the "many writings" <span id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_307) left by St.
Francis to the Poor Ladies at St. Damian's, only two fragments are known
to exist, and these have been preserved to us through St. Clare herself,
in so far as she incorporated them in the sixth chapter of her Rule. We
have it on the authority of Pope Gregory IX that St. Francis wrote for
St. Clare and her first companions a *formula vitae*, or "little rule,"
at the beginning of their religious life. <span
id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_308) But it was this same Pope Gregory IX,
then known as Cardinal Ugolino, who about 1219 composed a Rule for the
Poor Ladies, which was accepted by St. Francis and confirmed by Honorius
III. <span id="fr_309"></span>[3](#fn_309) This Rule, as the Pontiff
himself declares, was solemnly professed by Clare and her Sisters and
observed by them for many years in a praiseworthy manner. <span
id="fr_310"></span>[4](#fn_310) Pope Innocent IV bears witness to the
same effect. Writing to Blessed Agnes, Princess of Bohemia (who had
founded a house of the Second Order at Prague), of this Rule, written by
Cardinal

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ugolino, he says:
The Sisters of the Monastery of St. Damian and all others of your Order
have laudably observed it from the time of its profession *until
now*." <span id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_311) These words were written on
November 13, 1243.

In view of such testimony it is obviously a mistake to assert, as
Wadding and some other writers do, that St. Clare abandoned this Rule in
1224, and professed another one written by St. Francis. It is also
erroneous to suppose that St. Francis ever wrote a Rule for the Poor
Ladies. <span id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_312) The one written about
1219, by Cardinal Ugolino, was recast by St. Clare herself toward the
close of her life, and made to conform as far as possible to the Second
Rule written by St. Francis for the Friars Minor. The Rule of the Poor
Ladies, thus recast by St. Clare in a new form, was confirmed by
Innocent IV, August 9, 1253, just two days before the death of the holy
abbess. <span id="fr_313"></span>[3](#fn_313)

In the sixth chapter of this Rule, St. Clare describes the circumstances
under which the two fragments of St. Francis’ writings here given were
composed. "After the Most High Heavenly Father deigned by His grace to
enlighten my heart," St. Clare tells us, "to do penance after the
example and teaching of our most blessed father, St. Francis, a little
while after his own conversion, I, together with

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

my sisters, voluntarily promised him obedience. But, seeing that we
feared no poverty, toil, sorrow, abasement and contempt of the world,
nay rather that we held them in great delight, the blessed father, moved
by compassion, wrote us a rule of life <span
id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_314) in this form . . . ." Then follows the
first of the two fragments given below. Further on in the same chapter
of her Rule, the holy abbess adds: "To the end that we and also those
who might come after us should never fall away from the most holy
poverty which we had undertaken, he again wrote to us shortly before his
death <span id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_315) his last wish, saying . . .
." <span id="fr_316"></span>[3](#fn_316) Then follows the second of the
two fragments here given.

Both these pieces, which Wadding took for letters <span
id="fr_317"></span>[4](#fn_317) addressed to St. Clare, are here
translated according to the text of the Rule contained in the original
bull of Innocent IV. <span id="fr_318"></span>[5](#fn_318) They are as
follows:

#### 1. FORM OF LIFE WHICH ST. FRANCIS WROTE FOR ST. CLARE. <span id="fr_319"></span>[6](#fn_319)

Since, by divine inspiration, you have made yourselves daughters and
handmaids of the Most

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> High Sovereign
King, the Heavenly Father, and have espoused yourselves to the Holy
Ghost, choosing to live according to the perfection of the holy Gospel,
I will, and I promise to have always, by myself and my brothers, a
diligent care and special solicitude for you, as for them. <span
id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_320)

#### 2. LAST WISH WHICH ST. FRANCIS WROTE TO ST. CLARE.

I, little brother Francis, wish to follow the life and poverty of Jesus
Christ our Most High Lord and of His Most Holy Mother and to persevere
therein until the end. And I beseech you all, my ladies, and counsel
you, to live always in this most holy life and poverty. And watch
yourselves well that you in no wise depart from it through the teaching
or advice of any one.

Second Order and the early Rule, see Lemmens: "Die Anfänge des
Clarissenordens" in the *Römische Quartalschrift*, t. XVI, 1902, pp.
93-124, which is in the nature of a rejoinder to Dr. Lempp's article
with the same title, published in Brieger's *Zeitschrift für
Kirchengeschichte*, XIII, 181-245.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[76:3](wosf08.htm#fr_313) This Rule is

<span id="fn_315"></span>[77:2](wosf08.htm#fr_315) The biographers place
the writing of this fragment in the autumn of 1220, after St. Francis
returned from the East.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[77:5](wosf08.htm#fr_318) This bull, which had
been lost for several centuries, was brought to light early in 1893,
after a protracted search in different countries; it was found wrapped
within an old mantle of Saint Clare, preserved in the Monastery of Santa
Chiara, at Assisi. See *Seraph. Legislat.*, pp. 2, seq. See also G.
Cozza-Luzi: *Un autografo di Innocenzo IV e Memorie di S. Chiara*, ed.
2da., Rome, 1895.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[77:6](wosf08.htm#fr_319) Some critics regard
this fragment as a promise or engagement accompanying the *formula
vitae* or as the beginning of <span id="page_78">p. 78</span> the
*formula* itself, and believe that the text of the latter, now lost, was
also inserted originally in the sixth chapter of St. Clare's Rule. Be
this as it may, it is certain that this chapter has been completely
changed in several editions. In the vernacular versions of it, based on
Wadding, the two fragments here given do not appear at all. See Fr. Van
Ortroy, S.J., in *Anal. Boll.*, t. xxiv, fasc. iii, p. 412.
