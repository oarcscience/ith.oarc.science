### IV.

### TO THE RULERS OF THE PEOPLE.

This letter is known to us only by the testimony of the Ven. Francis
Gonzaga, O.F.M., <span id="fr_504"></span>[1](#fn_504) who, speaking of
the Province of Aragon in his work on the origin of the Seraphic
Order, <span id="fr_505"></span>[2](#fn_505) mentions that Bl. John
Parenti, first Minister General after St. Francis (1227-1232), brought a
copy of the letter into Spain. On the good faith of Gonzaga, Wadding
included this letter in his edition of the *Opuscula*, where it figures
as Epist. XV. As the style of the letter and the ideas it embodies
corresponded so admirably with the writings of St. Francis, the
Quaracchi editors and Professor Goetz, <span
id="fr_506"></span>[3](#fn_506) have not hesitated to accept it as
genuine. No copy of the letter other than that transcribed by Wadding
has so far been found, and it is according to his text of 1623 that it
is here translated:—

#### TO THE RULERS OF THE PEOPLE.

To all *podestàs*, and consuls, judges and governors, in whatever part
of the world, and to all others to whom this letter may come, Brother
Francis, your little and contemptible servant, wishes health and peace
to you.

Consider and see that the day of death draws nigh. <span
id="fr_507"></span>[4](#fn_507) I ask you, therefore, with such
reverence as I can, not to forget the Lord on account of the cares and
solicitudes of this world and not to

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

turn aside from His commandments, for all those who forget Him and
decline from His commandments are cursed <span
id="fr_508"></span>[1](#fn_508) and they shall be forgotten by
Him. <span id="fr_509"></span>[2](#fn_509) And when the day of death
comes, all that which they think they have shall be taken away from
them. <span id="fr_510"></span>[3](#fn_510) And the wiser and more
powerful they may have been in this world, so much the greater torments
shall they endure in hell. <span id="fr_511"></span>[4](#fn_511)

Wherefore, I strongly advise you, my lords, to put aside all care and
solicitude and to receive readily the most holy Body and Blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ in holy commemoration of Him. And cause so great honor
to be rendered the Lord by the people committed to you, that every
evening it may be announced by a crier or by another sign to the end
that praises and thanks shall resound to the Lord God Almighty from all
the people. And if you do not do this, know that you are beholden to
render an account before your Lord God Jesus Christ on the day of
Judgment. Let those who keep this writing with them and observe it know
that they are blessed by the Lord God.
