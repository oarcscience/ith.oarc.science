### V.

### TO ALL THE CUSTODES.

Wadding seems to have known of this letter indirectly. At least he gives
us a shorter letter addressed to the custodes. The beginning of the
epistle he numbers XIV is similar to the one which is translated here
and seems to be an incomplete summary of the latter. It is difficult,
however, to decide conclusively, since the original form of the letter,
which Wadding translated from the Spanish, is wanting. The solution of
the question would be to ascertain from what source this Spanish letter
was drawn.

The letter was first published in its present form by M. Sabatier in
1900 from a fourteenth century MS. in the Guarnacci library at
Volterra. <span id="fr_512"></span>[1](#fn_512.md) The Quaracchi text is
also based on this codex, than which no other version of the letter is
known to exist. Internal arguments might, however, be adduced to
establish the authenticity of the letter, which is as follows:—

#### TO ALL THE CUSTODES.

To all the custodes of the Brothers Minor to whom this letter shall
come, Brother Francis, your servant and little one in the Lord God,
sends greeting with new signs of heaven and earth <span
id="fr_513"></span>[2](#fn_513.md) which on the part of the Lord are great
and most excellent and which are accounted least of all by many
religious and by other men.

I entreat you more than if it were a question

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

of myself that, when it is becoming and it may seem to be expedient, you
humbly beseech the clerics to venerate above all the most holy Body and
Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ and His Holy Name and written words which
sanctify the body. <span id="fr_514"></span>[1](#fn_514.md) They ought to
hold as precious the chalices, corporals, ornaments of the altar, and
all that pertain to the Sacrifice. And if the most holy Body of the Lord
be lodged very poorly in any place, let It according to the command of
the Church be placed by them and left in a precious place, and let It be
carried with great veneration and administered to others with
discretion. The Names also and written words of the Lord, wheresoever
they may be found in unclean places, let them be collected, and they
ought to be put in a proper place.

And in all the preaching you do, admonish the people concerning penance
and that no one can be saved except he that receives the most sacred
Body and Blood of the Lord. <span id="fr_515"></span>[2](#fn_515.md) And
while It is being sacrificed by the priest on the altar and It is being
carried to any place, let all the people on bended knees render praise,
honor, and glory to the Lord God Living and True.

And you shall so announce and preach His praise to all peoples that at
every hour and when the bells are rung praise and thanks shall always be
given to the Almighty God by all the people through the whole earth.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

And to whomsoever of my brothers, custodes, this writing shall come, let
them copy it and keep it with them and cause it to be copied for the
brothers who have the office of preaching and the care of brothers, and
let them unto the end preach all those things that are contained in this
writing: let them know they have the blessing of the Lord God and mine.
And let these be for them through true and holy obedience.
