### V.

### THE CANTICLE OF THE SUN.

Of the several "cantica in vulgari" which St. Francis composed, the only
one that has come down to us, as far as is known, is the "Praises of the
Creatures," or, as it is now more commonly called, "The Canticle of the
Sun." Celano, who alludes to this laud, says of St. Francis that he was
of the race of Ananias, Azarias and Misael, inviting all creatures with
him to glorify Him who made them. <span id="fr_560"></span>[1](#fn_560)
It is this side of St. Francis’ thoughts which finds expression in the
Canticle; and in this particular order of ideas modern religious poetry
has never produced anything comparable to this sublime improvisation
into which have passed alike "all the wealth of the Saint's imagination
and all the boldness of his genius." <span
id="fr_561"></span>[2](#fn_561) Tradition tells us that Fra Pacifico had
a hand in the embellishment of this laud, <span
id="fr_562"></span>[3](#fn_562) about which a whole controversial
literature has grown. <span id="fr_563"></span>[4](#fn_563) Some light
may perhaps be thrown on this delicate question in the new critical
edition of the Canticle promised by Luigi Suttina.

The Canticle appears to have been composed toward the close of the year
1225 in a poor little hut near the Monastery of San Damiano, whither St.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Francis had
retired on account of his infirmities, and, if we may believe the
tradition which finds formal expression in the *Speculum Perfectionis*,
two strophes were subsequently added by the Saint to the original
composition,—the eighth strophe upon the occasion of a feud between the
Bishop and the magistrates of Assisi, and the ninth one when the Saint
recognized the approach of death. M. Renan, with what Canon Knox
Little <span id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_564) calls "his characteristic
inaccuracy," asserts that we do not possess the Italian original of the
Canticle, but have only an Italian translation from the Portuguese,
which was in turn translated from the Spanish. <span
id="fr_565"></span>[2](#fn_565) And yet the original Italian text
exists, as M. Sabatier notes, <span id="fr_566"></span>[3](#fn_566) not
only in numerous MSS. in Italy and France, notably in the Assisi MS. M
338 <span id="fr_567"></span>[4](#fn_567) and at the Mazarin
Library, <span id="fr_568"></span>[5](#fn_568) but also in the *Book of
the Conformities*.

The Canticle is accepted as authentic by Professors Boehmer and Goetz in
their recent works on the *Opuscula* of St. Francis. If it does not
figure in the Quaracchi edition, the reason is that the *Bibliotheca
Franciscana Ascetica Medii Ævi*, of which the Opuscula forms part, is
confined to works written in Latin, and hence M. Sabatier's
animadversions on the "theological preoccupations" of the Quaracchi
editors are altogether aside the mark.

The text of the Canticle here translated is that of the Assisi MS. 338
(fol. 33), from which the version

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

given in the *Conformities* (pars. 2, fol. ii) <span
id="fr_569"></span>[1](#fn_569) differs only by some unimportant
variants. The following is an attempt to render literally into English
the naïf rhythm of the original Italian, which necessarily disappears in
any formal rhymed translation:

| HERE BEGIN THE PRAISES OF THE CREATURES WHICH THE BLESSED FRANCIS MADE TO THE PRAISE AND HONOR OF GOD WHILE HE WAS ILL AT ST. DAMIAN'S: |

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Most high, omnipotent, good Lord,  
Praise, glory and honor and benediction all, are Thine.  
To Thee alone do they belong, most High,  
And there is no man fit to mention Thee.

Praise be to Thee, my Lord, with all Thy creatures,  
Especially to my worshipful brother sun,  
The which lights up the day, and through him dost Thou brightness
give;  
And beautiful is he and radiant with splendor great;  
Of Thee, most High, signification gives.

Praised be my Lord, for sister moon and for the stars,  
In heaven Thou hast formed them clear and precious and fair. <span
id="page_153">p. 153</span>

Praised be my Lord for brother wind  
And for the air and clouds and fair and every kind of weather,  
By the which Thou givest to Thy creatures nourishment.  
Praised be my Lord for sister water,  
The which is greatly helpful and humble and precious and pure.

Praised be my Lord for brother fire,  
By the which Thou lightest up the dark.  
And fair is he and gay and mighty and strong.

Praised be my Lord for our sister, mother earth,  
The which sustains and keeps us  
And brings forth diverse fruits with grass and flowers bright.

Praised be my Lord for those who for Thy love forgive  
And weakness bear and tribulation.  
Blessed those who shall in peace endure,  
For by Thee, most High, shall they be crowned.  
Praised be my Lord for our sister, the bodily death,  
From the which no living man can flee.  
Woe to them who die in mortal sin;  
Blessed those who shall find themselves in Thy most holy will,  
For the second death shall do them no ill.

Praise ye and bless ye my Lord, and give Him thanks,  
And be subject unto Him with great humility.
