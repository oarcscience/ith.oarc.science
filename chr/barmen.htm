An Appeal to the Evangelical Congregations and Christians in
Germany</strong></font></h2>

<p><a name="01"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.01</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> The Confessional Synod of the German
Evangelical Church met in Barmen, May 29-31, 1934. Here
representatives from all the German Confessional Churches met
with one accord in a confession of the one Lord of the one, holy,
apostolic Church. In fidelity to their Confession of Faith,
members of Lutheran, Reformed, and United Churches sought a
common message for the need and temptation of the Church in our
day. With gratitude to God they are convinced that they have been
given a common word to utter. It was not their intention to found
a new Church or to form a union. For nothing was farther from
their minds than the abolition of the confessional status of our
Churches. Their intention was, rather, to withstand in faith and
unanimity the destruction of the Confession of Faith, and thus of
the Evangelical Church in Germany. In opposition to attempts to
establish the unity of the German Evangelical Church by means of
false doctrine, by the use of force and insincere practices, the
Confessional Synod insists that the unity of the Evangelical
Churches in Germany can come only from the Word of God in faith
through the Holy Spirit. Thus alone is the Church renewed.<br>
</strong></font><a name="02"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.02</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> Therefore the Confessional Synod calls upon
the congregations to range themselves behind it in prayer, and
steadfastly to gather around those pastors and teachers who are
loyal to the Confessions.<br>
</strong></font><a name="03"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.03</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> Be not deceived by loose talk, as if we
meant to oppose the unity of the German nation! Do not listen to
the seducers who pervert our intentions, as if we wanted to break
up the unity of the German Evangelical Church or to forsake the
Confessions of the Fathers!<br>
</strong></font><a name="04"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.04</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> Try the spirits whether they are of God!
Prove also the words of the Confessional Synod of the German
Evangelical Church to see whether they agree with Holy Scripture
and with the Confessions of the Fathers. If you find that we are
speaking contrary to Scripture, then do not listen to us! But if
you find that we are taking our stand upon Scripture, then let no
fear or temptation keep you from treading with us the path of
faith and obedience to the Word of God, in order that God's
people be of one mind upon earth and that we in faith experience
what he himself has said: &quot;I will never leave you, nor
forsake you.&quot; Therefore, &quot;Fear not, little flock, for
it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.&quot; </strong></font></p>

Theological Declaration Concerning the Present Situation of the
German Evangelical Church</strong></font></h2>

<p><a name="05"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>8.05</strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong> According to the opening words of
its constitution of July 11, 1933, the German Evangelical Church
is a federation of Confessional Churches that grew our of the
Reformation and that enjoy equal rights. The theological basis
for the unification of these Churches is laid down in Article 1
and Article 2(1) of the constitution of the German Evangelical
Church that was recognized by the Reich Government on July 14,
1933:</strong></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Article 1. The inviolable
        foundation of the German Evangelical Church is the gospel
        of Jesus Christ as it is attested for us in Holy
        Scripture and brought to light again in the Confessions
        of the Reformation. The full powers that the Church needs
        for its mission are hereby determined and limited.</strong></font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Article 2 (1). The German
        Evangelical Church is divided into member Churches </strong><strong><i>Landeskirchen).</i></strong></font></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="06"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.06</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> We, the representatives of Lutheran,
Reformed, and United Churches, of free synods, Church assemblies,
and parish organizations united in the Confessional Synod of the
German Evangelical Church, declare that we stand together on the
ground of the German Evangelical Church as a federation of German
Confessional Churches. We are bound together by the confession of
the one Lord of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.<br>
</strong></font><a name="07"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.07</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> We publicly declare before all evangelical
Churches in Germany that what they hold in common in this
Confession is grievously imperiled, and with it the unity of the
German Evangelical Church. It is threatened by the teaching
methods and actions of the ruling Church party of the
&quot;German Christians&quot; and of the Church administration
carried on by them. These have become more and more apparent
during the first year of the existence of the German Evangelical
Church. This threat consists in the fact that the theological
basis, in which the German Evangelical Church is united, has been
continually and systematically thwarted and rendered ineffective
by alien principles, on the part of the leaders and spokesmen of
the &quot;German Christians&quot; as well as on the part of the
Church administration. When these principles are held to be
valid, then, according to all the Confessions in force among us,
the Church ceases to be the Church and th German Evangelical
Church, as a federation of Confessional Churches, becomes
intrinsically impossible.<br>
</strong></font><a name="08"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.08 </strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong>As members of Lutheran, Reformed, and United
Churches we may and must speak with one voice in this matter
today. Precisely because we want to be and to remain faithful to
our various Confessions, we may not keep silent, since we believe
that we have been given a common message to utter in a time of
common need and temptation. We commend to God what this may mean
for the intrrelations of the Confessional Churches.<br>

forgiveness of all our sins, so, in the same way and with the

godless fetters of this world for a free, grateful service to his
creatures. <br>

the brethren in which Jesus Christ acts presently as the Lord in

pardoned sinners, it has to testify in the midst of a sinful

with its order, that it is solely his property, and that it lives
and wants to live solely from his comfort and from his direction
in the expectation of his appearance.<br>

Scripture tells us that, in the as yet unredeemed world in which
the Church also exists, the State has by divine appointment the
task of providing for justice and peace. [It fulfills this task]
by means of the threat and exercise of force, according to the
measure of human judgment and human ability. The Church
acknowledges the benefit of this divine appointment in gratitude
and reverence before him. It calls to mind the Kingdom of God,
God's commandment and righteousness, and thereby the
responsibility both of rulers and of the ruled. It trusts and
obeys the power of the Word by which God upholds all things.<br>
