### A Discourse of the Efficient of Regeneration

#### Part II

###### by

#### Stephen Charnock

*Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God.*—John 1:13.

Two doctrines were raised from these words.

1\. That man, in all his capacities, is too weak to produce the work of
regeneration in himself.

This I have despatched, and now proceed to the

2nd Doct. God alone is the prime efficient cause of regeneration.

It is subjectively in the creature, efficiently from God. Ezekiel's dry
bones met not together of their own accord, Ezek. xxxvii. 5, 6, or by
chance, but were gathered by God, and inspired with life; and not only
the last act of life, but the whole formation of them in every part, he
does particularly own as the act of his own power. And doing every part
of it by degrees, they should know, by that admirable work upon them,
that he was God: 'I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall
live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring flesh upon you, and
cover you with skin; and you shall live, and you shall know that I am
the Lord.' This work does as much discover the glory of his deity, and
speaks him God in a more illustrious manner than the creation of the
world. We know him to be the Lord Jehovah by his creation of the world;
but a clearer knowledge of him in his power is added by his regeneration
of the soul. The sinews, flesh, skin, all the preparations to grace, are
from God, as all the preparations of that mass of clay for the breath of
life in Adam were from the power of God, as well as the living soul
itself. Most do understand it of the recovery of the Jews from the
captivity of Babylon; but certainly it has a higher import, and respects
the time of the gospel, and the renewing of life in the soul of all the
Israel of God. (1.) Because the prophecy extends further than the two
tribes captivated in Babylon; for, verse 11, the bones are said to be
'the whole house of Israel,' who despaired of ever seeing and good,
complaining that their bones were dried: ver. 11, 'Our hope is lost, we
are cut off for our parts.' Which could not be rationally the complaint
of the Jews, who had a promise that, after seventy years' captivity,
they should return, and therefore their case was not so desperate. (2.)
Because, verse 14, he speaks of 'putting his Spirit into them;' meaning
thereby that work he had spoken of in the former chapter, Ezek. xxxvi.
7, which certainly, being a covenant of grace, respected the times of
the gospel. If it be said that it is meant of forming the church, it
must also be meant of forming every member of it, since the least member
of Adam was formed by God, as well as the whole body. Certainly, if
renewed men, after some great falls, having still the root of habitual
grace in them, cry to God, out of a sense of their own insufficiency,
for the creating a clean heart, as David does, Ps. li. 10, 'Create in me
a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me;' if he then,
who had this root remaining, and had some sparks which presently were
blown up upon Nathan's speech to him, cries out for a new creation, what
need has he then of an almighty breath who has not any warm ashes of
grace or any one string of a spiritual root in his soul! Whatsoever,
therefore, is holy, good, and spiritual in us, we owe to the
new-creating grace of God. All graces are his "charismata", his free
donatives, over and above his common largeness to nature, a present from
his infinite liberality.

I shall show,

I. That God is the efficient.

II\. That it is necessary he should be so.

III\. From what principles in God it flows.

IV\. How God does it.

V. The use of it.

I. That God is the efficient.

(1.) In the first promise, Gen. iii. 15, 'I will put enmity,' &c. In
which promise is included the whole work of redemption, and new creating
man under another head, with another nature, which should not comply
with the designs of Satan, or gratify the great enemy of God and mankind
by unravelling the work of God, and subjecting himself to misery. It was
necessary to our happiness that the league between Stan and us should be
broken, that we should turn to God, hate the works of the devil, and
join with the interest which Satan endeavoured to overthrow. And God
promises that he would do it; he challenges it as his own work: 'I will
put enmity;' he leaves it not to men or angels to begin hostility. Every
one, therefore, that is at a true variance with Satan is 'God's
workmanship, created in Christ,' by a second creation, as well as he was
created to a natural life in Adam by the first creation, and 'created to
good works, that he may walk in them', Eph. ii. 10. That is, is
fashioned by God to walk in ways contrary to those of Satan, which is
the greatest enmity we can express to the devil, who envied God a
service from the holiness of Adam's nature. And Satan having made that
conquest, and gained man to be his friend, it is not easy to conceive
how any lower power could unfasten this knot, and set them at variance,
since the devil had both wit enough to humour man and strength enough to
keep him.

(2.) In the times of the gospel. No less than seven times *I will* he
does affix to his promise of the covenant, as has been observed before,
Ezek. xxxvi. 25-27. What seed was left to keep up the name of God among
the Jews was of his begetting: Rom. ix. 29, 'Except the Lord of Sabaoth
had left us a seed,' cited out of Isa. i. 9. Their standing was not
their act, but God's: and 1 Kings xix. 18, 'I have left me seven
thousand, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal.' Others were left
to themselves; these were signally wrought upon by his grace. Others are
but instruments; God is the principal agent in all the seed of the
church scattered in the whole earth: Hosea ii. 23, 'I will sow her to me
in the earth,' alluding to the name Jezreel, which signifies the seed of
God. If ever the sons of Japheth 'dwell in the tents of Shem,' it must
be by God's 'persuasion,' Gen. ix. 27. The word rendered *enlarge*
signifies to allure. The Spirit of grace is of God's effusion, Zech.
xii. 10; it is God's pouring out a Spirit of grace on them before their
looking up to God. (Where, by the way, observe a signal testimony of the
deity of Christ; 'They shall look upon me whom they have pierced;' he
that pours upon them the Spirit of grace is he whom they pierced, which
was the Lord Jehovah, verse 8; for where in your Bibles Lord is written
in great letters, the Hebrew word there is *Jehovah*; the highest name
of God is here attributed to Christ.) And even in the last times he will
still be the only agent in it. When God speaks of the Jews' dispersion,
under which they are at this day, he owns this work upon their hearts at
last to be an act of his own power and of covenant mercy: Deut. xxx. 6,
'The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart,' &c., which some of the
Jews understand of the time of the Messiah. God will challenge this work
as his own right to the end of the world.

2\. Christ appropriates it to God, and acknowledges it to depend only
upon his will. Had any other cause been in conjunction with God, our
Saviour would not have deprived it of its due praise, nor with so much
thankfulness and amazement admired the gracious pleasure of his Father
as he did,—Mat. xi. 25, 'At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank
thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes:
even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight,'—at that time,
after he had been discoursing of the judgments upon them for their
refusal of the gospel, worse than Sodom and Gomorrah. It was God's
pleasure not to reveal it to them, and God's justice to punish them for
refusal, because they wilfully refused it. The outward teaching was to
all in the ministry of Christ, the inward revelation only to few
according to the good pleasure of God. Christ was the outward teacher,
but God the inward inspirer. That others are not renewed by him is not
because he cannot, for he is Lord of heaven and earth, but because he
will renew some and not others. Our Saviour refers it here only to the
good pleasure of God; he had erred much in ascribing it to God, if he
had had the assistance of any other cause. Why this part of the clay he
had created was formed into the body of Adam and not another, had no
other cause but his pleasure; why this part of corrupted Adam is formed
into a temple, a divine image, and not another, can be ascribed to no
other but the same cause. He that formed Adam in the earthly paradise,
forms every believer in the church, the spiritual paradise, and neither
has a co-worker nor motive without himself.

3\. The Scripture everywhere appropriates it to God. They are therefore
called his saints, Ps. xxxiv. 9, as being sanctified by him as well as
belonging to him, 'his people,' 'the branch of his planting', 'the work
of his hands,' peculiarly his, as being created for his glory, 'that I
may be glorified,' Isa. lx. 21. Their fitness by grace for glory is the
work of his hands. The vessels of wrath are fitted for destruction, not
by God, but by themselves, Rom. ix. 22. But the vessels of mercy are
prepared by him, ver. 23, 'He had before prepared unto glory.' Adam lost
himself, but whosoever of his posterity are recovered are 'wrought by
God for glory,' 1 Cor. v. 5. It is observable that the apostle ascribes
this in the whole frame of it to God: 1 Cor. i. 30, 'But of him are you
in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness,' &c.,
because he would remove all cause of boasting in the creature. He did
not only set forth Christ at first as a principle of righteousness, and
redemption, and sanctification, but engrafted in him, whosoever is in
him, for the enjoyment of those privileges, and made him not only in
general to the world, but to *us*, in the particular application, a
principle of sanctification as well as righteousness. Union with Christ,
engrafting in him, new creation, putting into another state, are all
purely the work of God. He has no sharer in it. As Christ trod the
winepress alone in the work of redemption, so God engrafts men alone
into this vine. As Christ was the sole worker of redemption, so is God
the sole worker of regeneration. In him we are created, but solely by
God's skill; Christ the vine, and believers the branches, the one
planted and the other engrafted by the same husbandman, John xv. 1, 2;
he only planted and dressed Christ for us, he only plants and dresses us
in Christ. It is 'by his own will,' not any other, that 'he begot us,'
James i. 18. 'Of his own will,' his own good pleasure was the motive,
his own strength the efficient. Hence he is called 'the Father of
spirits,' Heb. xii. 9, not so much (as some interpret it, and that most
probably) as he is the Father of souls by creation, as by regeneration,
which adds a greater strength to the apostle's argument for submission
to him and patience under his strokes. He keeps in his own hand the keys
of the heart, no less than the key of the womb, which was always
acknowledged to be in the hands of God. It is with this prerogative of
God that Jacob silences Rachel, when she so impatiently cried out for
children, as if she had a resolution to kill herself if she had them
not, with this, 'Am I in God's stead?' Gen. xxx. 1, 2. He only opens the
womb of the soul as well as that of the body, impregnates it with grace,
and brings forth the fruit of holy actions, as Philo in his allegory
descants upon the place. The Jews perhaps meant no less in that saying
in their Cabala, Abraham had not had Isaac if a letter of the name of
God had not been added to his name; the power of God, a letter of his
name, must go to regeneration. It is appropriated to none but God in
Scripture: to the whole Trinity, without the conjunction of any
creature, to the Father as the author, therefore called 'Our Father;' to
Christ, as the pattern; to the Spirit, as the inspirer of that grace
whereby we are made the sons of God. The very heathen have acknowledged
this, some philosophers have affirmed, that the great virtue, wherein
they placed the happiness of man, could not be had but by the favour of
God, and all thought their heroes to be born of their gods.

And the Scripture affirms that,

(1.) All preparations to this work, as well as the work itself, are of
God. The removing indispositions, and the putting in good inclinations,
is the work of the same hand; the taking away the heart of stone, as
well as the giving a heart of flesh. He removes the rubbish as well as
rears the building; razes out the old stamp and imprints a new; destroys
sin, which is called the old man, and restores the new by the quickening
of the Spirit. The preparations of the dust of the ground to become a
human body, had the same author as the divine soul wherewith he was
inspired.

(2.) All the parts of the new creature are of God. Faith, which is the
principal part of it, is 'the faith of the operation of God,' Col. ii.
12; not but that love and other graces are wrought by God, but in this
grace, which is a constitutive part of the new creature, God comes in
with a greater irradiation upon the soul, because it has not one
fragment or point in nature to stand upon, carnal reason and mere moral
righteousness being enemies to it, whereas all other graces are but the
rectifying the passions, and setting them upon right objects. Yet all
these, too, own him as the author. Our knowledge of God is a light
growing from his knowledge of us; 'we know God' because we 'are known of
him.' Gal. iv. 9. The elective act of our wills is but a fruit of his
choice of us: John xv. 16, 'You have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you;' our willing of him is a birth of his willing us, our love a spark
kindled by his love to us. God first calls us *my people*, before any of
us call him *my God*, Hosea ii. 23. The moon shines not upon the sun
till it be first illuminated by it. God first shines upon us before we
can reflect upon him; he calls us before we can speak to him in his own
dialect; our coming is an effect of his drawing, and our power of coming
an effect of his quickening. Every member in Adam was a fruit of his
power, as well as the whole body; every line drawn in the new creature
is done by his pencil as well as the whole frame.

(3.) The acts of the new creature. God does not only give us the habit
of faith, but the act of faith: Philip. i. 29, 'Unto you it is given in
the behalf of Christ, not only to believe, but also to suffer for his
sake.' By believing is meant the act of believing, as by suffering is
meant not only the power of suffering, but actual suffering; as the
fruits upon the trees at the first creation were created as well as the
tree which had a power to bear. The very attention of Lydia to the
gospel preached by Paul was wrought by God, as well as the opening of
her heart, Acts xvi. 14. Our walking in his statutes is a fruit of his
grace, as well as the putting in his Spirit to enable us thereunto. The
very act of motion is made by the head and heart, if there he a failing
of spirits there, if any obstruction that they cannot reach the indigent
part, the motion ceases. David acknowledged God his continual strength
in his holy pursuits, 'My soul follows hard after thee,' Ps. lxiii. 8.
But what was the cause? 'Thy right hand upholds me.' His life and power
issued out from the right hand of God. The graces of God's people stand
in need of the irradiations of God, like the *Urim* and *Thummim*,
before any counsel could be given by them.

(4.) The continuance both of the power and acts are from God. Habitual
grace is called the 'fear of the Lord' put into the soul; the
continuance of it is by his constant sustentation, it is that we may not
depart from him Jer. xxxii. 40, 'from upon him,' from leaning upon him,
or believing in him, as the word "me'alaw" imports. If that fear put in
did once depart from us, we should no longer cleave to God; we stick to
him only because he ties us to himself, and cannot be continually with
him unless he 'holds us by his right hand,' Ps. lxxiii. 23. The grace
that is wrought, as well as the gospel which instrumentally wrought it,
is 'kept by the Holy Ghost,' 2 Tim. i. 14; he begins every good work,
and he performs it. He was the sole active cause in the creation of the
faculties, and the principal cause in preserving them; he is the sole
cause of the elevation of the faculties, and the preservation of them in
that elevated state. As the virtue of the loadstone is not only the
cause of the first attraction of the steel, but of its constant
adhesion, therefore it is said: 1 Cor. i. 21, that 'God does establish
us,' not has done, to note the continual influence of his grace upon us.
It was the dropping of the two olive trees that constantly fed the lamps
in the candlesticks, Zech. iv. 2, 8. Take this new birth in all the
denominations of it, it is altogether ascribed to God. As it is a call
out of the world, God is the herald, 2 Tim. i. 9; as it is a creation,
God is the creator Eph. ii. 10; as it is a resurrection, God is the
quickener, Eph. ii. 5; as it is a new birth, God is the begetter, 1
Peter i. 3; as it is a new heart, God is the framer, Ezek. xxxvi. 26; as
it is a law in the heart, God is the penman, Jer. xxxi. 33; as it is a
translation out of Satan's kingdom, and making us denizens of the
kingdom of Christ, God is the translator, Col. i. 13; as it is a coming
to Christ, God is the drawer, John vi. 44; as it is a turning to God,
God is the attracter.

II\. The second thing; it is necessary God should be the efficient of
regeneration. He is, or none.

In regard of God.

1\. As he is the first cause of all things. He is the creator of the
lowest worm, and the highest angel; the glimmering perfections of the
least fly, as well as the more glittering eminencies of the angelical
nature, are distinct beams from that fountain of light and power. Shall
not he then be the cause of the divine motions of the will, as well as
of the natural motions of the creatures? Every perfection in a rational
creature, or any other, supposes that perfection to be somewhere
essentially; every impression supposes a stamp that made it, every
stream a fountain from whence it sprang, every beam a sun, or some lucid
body from whence it darts. Whence should this gracious work then be
derived? Not from nature, which is contrary to it; not from Satan, who
is destroyed by it. It must be then from God, since it must have some
stable and perfect cause. He who was the cause of all the grace in the
head is also the cause of all the grace in the members. The same sun
that enlightens the heavens enlightens the earth. The grace that Christ
had was 'the gift of God,' John iii. 34, much more must it be his gift
to us, though we had souls as capacious as his. If the head derived not
his grace to himself, the members cannot; for Christ being a creature,
in regard of his humanity, must necessarily be dependent; for to make
any creature independent upon God is to advance it above the degree of a
creature-state, and make it God's fellow, yea, to have a godhead in
itself, as being the first principle of its own being. To say any
creature can move to God, without being moved by God, or live without
his influence, is to make the creature independent on God in its
operations; and if it be independent in its operations, it would be so
consequently in its essence, besides, if it be not created by him, it
may subsist without him, it stands in no need of his quickening. The
believers in Scripture were very unadvised then to pray to God for his
quickening and establishing grace, if he were not the enlivener and
author of it. His power works in preservation as well as creation, John
v. 17, and whatsoever is dependent on him in preservation is dependent
on him in creation and the first framing. And if it does not depend upon
him in preservation, it is not his creature, but it is a god. All
creatures have a dependence upon something immediately superior to then.
The moon receives her light and chief beauty from the sun, which else
would be but a dusky body; the earth its influence from the heavens. In
artificial things the little wheels in a watch depend upon the greater,
that upon the string (spring?), that in its motion upon the hand that
winds it up. The higher any creature is, the more immediately it depends
upon God in its production; the waters brought forth the fish, but God
himself formed man.

2\. As he is the promiser of it. The divine promise is only fulfilled by
a divine operation, it is necessary then for the honour of his truth to
be the performer of it. All his promises concerning this matter run in
that strain, I will: Hosea ii. 19, 'I will betroth thee to me for ever;
I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, in judgment, in
loving-kindness, and in mercy: I will even betroth thee unto me in
faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord.' The Lord promises by this
of knowing him all gracious works upon the soul, regeneration, faith,
&c., for this knowledge is an effect of the covenant which God promises
in that great copy of it: Jer. xxxi. 34, 'They shall all know me, from
the least of them to the greatest.' It is not a simple abstracted
knowledge, for so the devils know God, and Christ crucified, but such a
knowledge that implies faith and love, and a new frame of soul. It is
necessary his power should make good what his goodness has promised. It
was not necessary any word of promise should go out of his mouth, there
was no engagement upon God to do it, but it is necessary this promise
should be performed; though he were free before he promised, yet he is
not free after he has promised, because his truth engages him to perform
it, and perform it as his own act, as much as his mercy moved him to
promise it as his own act. As mercy made it, so his mercy is as pressing
for the performance, and there comes in a superadded obligation from
that of his truth over and above his mercy, to perform it in the same
manner he promised it, and in all the circumstances of it. So that,
supposing (which cannot be supposed) that his mercy should repent of
making it, he would not be true if he did not perform it; besides, it
consists not with his truth not to perform that by himself which he has
promised by himself, nor with his wisdom to leave that to an uncertain
cause at the best, and, further, a cause utterly unable (as every
creature is) to produce that which he had promised to do with his own
hand, as the cleansing the soul, pouring clean water upon it, pouring
out a spirit of grace, writing the law in the heart, which imply his own
act principally in this affair, in concurrence with the means he has
ordained to that end. The performance of God's promise is as infallible
as the cause that made the promise. No power can perform that for
another which he promises himself to do; for the thing itself may be
done by another, yet not being done by the party promising to do it, it
is not truly done, and in conformity to the promise made. If it were
possible then to be done by any but a divine hand, it would not be done
truly, because God promises it as his own act, and therefore the working
it must be his own act in conformity to his truth.

3\. As he has the foreknowledge of all things. It is necessary God
should foreknow everything future, and that shall come to pass. This is
a perfection necessarily belonging to God; and to imagine the contrary
is to frame an unworthy notion of God, and infinitely below the great
creator and governor of the world. He therefore wills everything, for if
he foreknew anything before he willed it in itself, or in its necessary
causes, he foreknow nothing. If he did not will it, how can it come to
pass? Therefore he did not foreknow that it would come to pass. If he
did foreknow it, then he willed it, otherwise his foreknowledge depended
upon an uncertain cause, and he might have judged that to come to pass
which never might; unless the cause be determined by God, it is merely
contingent. He willing therefore a work of grace in such and such
persons, did foreknow that it would be wrought, because he did will that
it should be, and his working is done by an act of his will: Rom. viii.
29, 'Whom he did foreknow, he did predestinate to be conformed to the
image of his Son.' The foreknowledge of God being stable and infallible,
and being in this case a foreknowledge of what makes highly for the
glory of all his attributes, can have no dependence upon an uncertain
and fallible cause, but upon a cause as stable as his foreknowledge,
which is his will, himself. His foreknowledge of this is not a
foreknowledge of it in any created cause, but in himself as the cause;
because, as it will appear further, no created cause could accomplish
it.

In regard of the subject of this new birth.

1 In regard of the subject simply considered, the heart and will of man,
none can cork upon it but God, or have any intrinsic influence to cause
it to exercise its vital acts. Angels, though of a very vast power,
cannot work immediately upon the heart and will of another creature, to
incline and change it, by an immediate touch. All that they can do
towards any moving the will, is by presenting some external objects, or
stirring up the inward sensitive appetite to some passion, as anger,
desire; whereby the will is inclined to will something. But the stirring
up those natural affections in an unregenerate man, can never incline
his will to good; for being the affections of the flesh, they are to be
crucified. Angels also may enlighten the understanding, not immediately,
but by presenting similitudes of sensible things, and confirming them in
the fancy; but to remove one ill habit from the will or incline it to
any good, is not in their power. God gave an angel power to purge the
prophet's lips with a coal from the altar, Isa. vi. 6, 7, but that was
done in a vision, and a symbol or sign only that his uncleanness was
removed. A coal could have no virtue in it to purge spiritual pollutions
from the spirit of a man. Neither can man change the will; men by
allurements or threats may change, or rather suspend the action of
another, as a father that threatens to disinherit his son; or a
magistrate that threatens to punish a subject for his debauchery, may
cause a change in the actions of such persons; but the heart stands
still to the same sinful points, and may be vicious under a fair
disguise. He only that made the will, can incline and 'turn it as the
rivers of waters; the heart of the king is in the hands of the Lord,'
Prov. xxi. 1, and so is every man's heart kept in the hands of him that
created it, both cabinet and key. No man knows the heart, no, the heart
itself knows not everything which is in it. God knows all the wards in
the heart, and knows how to move it. If a man could turn the heart of
another, it could only be in one or two points; it cannot be conceived
how he should alter the whole frame of it, make it quite another thing
than it was before. The spirit of man being 'the candle of the Lord,'
Prov. xx. 27, not to give light to him, but lighted by him, can only
when it is out be re-lighted, and, when it burns dim, be snuffed by the
same hand. Or, suppose for the present he could do this, it must be with
much pains and labour, many exhortations and wise management of him upon
several occasions. But to do this by a word, in a trice, to put a law
into the heart in a moment, and give the hidden man of the heart
possession of the will, that a man knows not himself how he came to be
changed, this whole work bears the mark and stamp of God in the forehead
of it. Men may propose arguments to another, and he may understand them
if he has a capacity, but no man can ever make another have a capacity
who is naturally incapable; it is God only can make the heart capable of
understanding, he only can put a new instinct into it, and make it of
another bent; it is he that renews the spirit of the mind to enable it
to understand what he does propose, and elevates the faculty to
apprehend the reason of it.

2\. In regard of the subject, extremely ill qualified. Can any question
the divinity of the work, when stones are made children to Abraham; when
waters of repentance are drawn out of a hard rock, Aaron's dry rod made
to bud and blossom, and bring forth fruit, Num. vii. 8, when souls
deeply allied to the kingdom of darkness are translated into the kingdom
of light? To see habits strengthened by custom, in a consumption, and
hearts filled with multitudes of idols in several shapes, casting them
out with indignation, and flourishing with new springing graces, it is
too great a miracle to be wrought by the hand of any creature. Could
anything but the arm of the Lord change the temper of the thief upon the
cross, to advance further in the space of an hour in the kingdom of God,
than all the apostles had done in the three years' converse with their
Master; to confess him, when one of the most eminent of them had denied
him; to be more knowing in an instant, than they had been in a long
time; and acknowledge his spiritual kingdom, when they even after his
resurrection, and just before his ascension, expected a temporal one?
Acts i. 6, 'Wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?' If a
Socrates, or a Cato, or those braver lights among the heathen, were
turned to God, the interest of God in the work might upon some seeming
ground be questioned; but when the leviathans in sin, drunkards,
extortioners, adulterers, men guilty of the greatest contempt of God and
the light of nature, in whom lust had kept a peaceable possession in its
empire for many years, are thoroughly changed, who can doubt but that
such must indeed be 'washed and sanctified by the Spirit of our God'? 1
Cor. vi. 11. What can this be but the will of God, since their hearts
were so delightfully filled with evil, that they had no room nor love
for any holy thought? It is not conceivable that where sin has made such
a rout, and cut and slashed all morality in pieces, things should he set
in order there, but by a power stronger both than sin and the law, from
whence sin derives its strength. It is no less than a divine miracle to
renew an habituated sinner.

(3.) In regard of the nature of this new birth. It is a change of
nature; a nature where there was as little of spiritual good as there
was of being in nothing before the creation. It is a change of stone
into flesh; a heart that like a stone has a hardness and settledness of
sinful parts, a strong resistance against any instrument, an
incorporation of sin and lust with its nature. Where the heart and sin,
self and sin, are cordially one and the same, none can change such a
nature but the God of all grace, who has all grace to contest with all
the power of old Adam. No man can change the nature of the meanest
creature in the world; he may tame them, bring them to part with some of
their wildness, but he cannot transform them. If no man can transform
the lowest creature from one nature to another, much less can any but
God transform man into another nature.

This nature is changed in every believer; for it is impossible a man
should stand bent to Christ, with his old nature predominant in him, any
more than a pebble can be attracted by a loadstone, till it put on the
nature of steel. An unrighteous nature cannot act righteously, it must
therefore be a God, who is above nature, that can clothe the soul with a
new nature, and incline it to God and goodness in its operations. Now to
see a lump of vice become a model of virtue; for one that drank in
iniquity like water, to change that sinful thirst for another for
righteousness; to crucify his darling flesh; to be weary of the poison
he loved for the purity he hated; to embrace the gospel terms, which not
his passion but his nature abhorred; to change his hating of duty to a
free-will offering of it; to make him cease from a loathing the
obligations of the law, to a longing to come up to the exactness of it;
to count it a burden to have the thoughts at a distance from God, when
before it was a burden to have one serious thought fixed on him, speaks
a supernatural grace transcendently attractive and powerfully operative.
Heavy elements do not ascend against their own nature, unless they be
drawn by some superior force. To see a soul neighed down to the earth,
to be lifted up to heaven, must point us to a greater than created
strength that caused the elevation. These acts are supernatural, and
cannot be done by a natural cause; that is, against the order of working
in all things, for then the effect, as an effect, would be more noble
than its cause.

(4.) In regard of the suddenness of it. Peter and Andrew were called
when they thought of nothing but their nets; and Paul changed by a word
or two, who before was not only unwilling, but rebellious. Some have
gone into a church wolves, and returned lambs. This change comes upon
some that never dreamt of it, and has snatched them out of the arms of
hell; upon others who have resisted with all their might any motion that
way, and were never greater enemies to any, than to those that would
check their sinful pleasures with such admonitions, and yet these have
been on the sudden surprised. What ground is there to ascribe any of
this, but to a divine work? Many have dropped in unto a sermon with no
intention to stay, who have felt God's hook in their souls; have leaped
like fish out of their element for a while, and God has caught them in
his hand. Have you never heard of some who have gone to make sport with
a convincing sermon, or to satisfy lust with unclean glances, who have
been made prisoners by grace before their return? This quickness of the
soul in coming to Christ was promised to be the fruit of the gospel:
Hosea iii. 5, 'They shall fear the Lord and his goodness,' when they
should 'seek the Lord and David their king.' The word "pachad" signifies
not only to fear, but to hasten; both significations may be joined
together in the sense of the verse. They shall make haste to fear the
Lord and his goodness; surely the power that performs it, is the same
with the goodness which promised it. Thus some of the disciples have
followed Christ at the first call, and moved readily to him, as iron to
the loadstone. For a man that was at a great distance from God, and any
affection to him, to be filled on the sudden with a warm love and zeal
for him, when nothing of interest could engage him (and sometimes it has
been with loss of friends, estate, yea, life too), is as great a
discovery of a divine hand, as if a fly were changed into the shape and
spirit of a hero; because a spiritual change is more admirable than a
natural; and the more by how much the enmity, which was greater, is
driven out, for a choice affection to rise up in its stead. The season
when such a work is wrought is more significant of a divine force, when
men have been in the heat and strength of the pursuit of their sinful
pleasures, being then torn out of the embracements of lust with an
outstretched arm of God.

(5.) In regard of the excellency of the new birth. Is it reasonable to
think that the image of God should be wrought by any other hand than the
hand of God, or the divine nature be begotten by anything but the divine
Spirit? Since none but man can beget a child in his own likeness, none
but God can impart to a soul the divine nature. It is not a change only
into the image of God with slight colours, an image drawn as with
charcoal; but a glorious image even in the rough draught, which grows up
into greater beauty by the addition of brighter colours. 'Changed,' says
the apostle, 2 Cor. iii. 18, 'into the same image from glory to glory;'
glory in the first lineaments as well as glory in the last lines. Is it
not too beautiful then, even in the first draught, to be wrought by any
pencil but a divine? It is next to the formation of Christ, for it is an
initial conformity to him. God is the fountain of all our good things.
If 'every good and perfect gift comes from him,' James i. 17, shall not
the best of beings be the author of the best of works? If believers are
'light in the Lord,' Eph. v. 8, they are no less light from him and by
him who is the 'Father of lights.' It is a 'heavenly calling,' Heb. iii.
1, therefore a heavenly birth. The new heart, the spiritual house
wherein God dwells, as well as in the heavens, was not made with a less
power and skill than the earth, which is his footstool, or the heaven,
which is his throne. If none be able to make God a footstool, much less
a throne, as Jerusalem, the church, is called in the times of the
gospel, Jer. iii. 17. (The embroideries and ornaments of the material
tabernacle were not made by common art, but by a Bezaleel inspired by
the Spirit of God, Exod. xxxi. 3); can any but himself rear up a temple
for the God of heaven to dwell in? 1 Cor. iii. 9. Or is the spiritual
house of God fit to be made by and but by that God that dwells in it? It
was according to the image of God that we were first created; it is
according to the image of Christ that we are new created, Rom. viii. 29.
Who understands the image of the Son but the Father? Who knows the
Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him? The new
creature, according to the copy, can only be wrought by him to whom the
copy is only visible. It is for the honour of God to allow him to be the
framer of all creatures in the rank of beings. Is it not a dishonour to
him not to acknowledge him the framer of the new creature in the rank of
spiritual beings, since the later is more excellent than the treasures
of the earth or the stars of heaven, than body or soul; since the image
of God consists not so much in the substance of the soul as in a
likeness to God in a holy nature? Eph. iv. 24. To be a righteous
regenerate man is more excellent than to be a man; the most glorious
effect, then, must have the most glorious cause. One beam of this divine
image is too excellent to be the workmanship of any but a divine hand.
The very first regenerate thought, to the last dropping off of impurity,
is from the same hand. The first drawing us from sin, much more the
stripping us of it, is more admirable than the drawing us out of
nothing.

(6.) The end of regeneration manifests it to be the work of God. It is
to display his goodness. Since this was the end of God in the first
creation, it is much more his end in the second. What creature can
display God's goodness for him, or give him the glory of it, without
first receiving it? Goodness must first be communicated to us, before it
can be displayed or reflected by us. The light that is reflected back
upon the sun by any earthly body beams first from the sun itself. Both
the subject and the end are put together in Isa. xliii. 20, 21, 'The
beasts of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I
give waters in the wilderness, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.'
The Gentiles shall have the gospel, who are beasts of the field for
wildness, dragons for the poison of their nature, owls for their
blindness and darkness. The waters of the gospel shall flow to them to
give drink to their souls. This people have I formed for myself. Even
beasts, dragons, owls, if formed for himself, they could not be formed
but by himself, who only understands what is fit for his own praise. How
can such incapable subjects be formed for such high ends, without a
supernatural power? So in Isa. lx. 21, 'The branch of my planting, the
work of my hands, that I may be glorified.' Planted by God, that God
might be glorified by them. As God only is the proper judge of what may
glorify him, so he is the sole author of what is fitted to glorify him.
Nothing lower than the goodness of God can instil into us such a
goodness as to be made meet to praise, serve, and love him; such a
holiness as may fit us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints
in light, and enjoy him for ever. As infinite wisdom formed us in Adam,
and moulded us with his own hand to be a model of his perfection, so are
we no less his workmanship in Christ by a second creation to good works,
which, as they are ordained by the will of God, so they are wrought in
us by the skill and power of God; what is ordained positively by him and
for him is wrought by him. The whole world consists but of two men and
their offspring the first man, Adam, the second man, Christ; both they,
and all in them, created by God. It is a forming a creature for himself
for his own delight. What delight can God take in anything but himself,
and what is like himself? Man in his best estate is vanity. As his being
is, so are his operations. Vanity, and the operations flowing from
thence, are no fit object for the delight of an infinite excellency and
wisdom. What pleasure can he have in those things which are not wrought
by his own finger? Who knows how to dress anything savoury and pleasant
to God but his own grace? Can a finite thing touch an infinite being to
enjoy him without the operation of an infinite virtue? Can God delight
in anything principally but himself, as he is infinitely good; or in
other things but as they come nearest to that goodness? Whatsoever has a
resemblance to a superior being must be brought forth into that likeness
by something superior to itself.

Now since the ends of this work are so high as to fit us for his praise,
his delight, and a fruition of him; since it is to bring the interest of
God into the soul, set him up highest in the heart who before was
trampled under our feet, enthrone him as king in the soul, cause us to
oppose all that opposes him, cherish everything that is agreeable to
him, this must be his work or the work of none.

(7.) The weakness of the means manifests it to be the work of God. How
could it be possible that such weak means, that were used at the first
plantation of the gospel, should have that transcendent success in the
hearts of men without a divine power? That a doctrine attended with the
cross, resisted by devils with all their subtilty, by the flesh with all
its lusts, the world with all its flatteries, the wise with all their
craft, the mighty with all their power, should be imprinted upon the
hearts of men; a doctrine preached by mean men, without any worldly
help, without learning, eloquence, craft, or human prudence, without the
force, favour, or friendship of men, should get place in men's hearts
without a divine inspiration, cannot well be imagined. If it be said
there were miracles attending it, which wrought upon the minds of men,
it is true; but what little force they had in our Saviour's time the
Scripture informs us, when they were ascribed to Beelzebub, the prince
of devils. Though miracles did attend it after the ascension of our
Saviour, yet the apostle ascribes not so much to them as the means, as
he does to the 'foolishness of preaching, ' it was that which was the
'power of God,' 1 Cor. i. 18; it was that 'whereto God saved them that
believe,' 1 Cor. i. 21. But the greatest change that ever was wrought at
one time was at the first descent of the Spirit, by a plain discourse of
Peter, Acts ii., extolling a crucified God before those that had lately
taken away his life, those that had seen him die, a doctrine which would
find no footing in their reasons, filled with prejudice against him, and
had expectations of a temporal kingdom by him. Must not this change be
ascribed to a higher hand, which removed their rooted prejudices and
vain hopes, and brought so many as three thousand over at once? If there
be 'diversities of operations, it is the same God that works all in
all,' 1 Cor. xii. 6. He conveys this 'treasure in earthen vessels, that
the power might appear to be of God, and not of men,' 2 Cor. iv. 7. Such
weak means as earthen vessels cannot work such miraculous changes.
Therefore perhaps it was that the preaching of Christ in his humiliation
had so little success attending it, that nothing should be ascribed to
the word itself, but to the power of God in it. To evidence that success
depended on the good pleasure of God, who would not make his preaching
in person so successful as that in his Spirit, which appears by Christ's
thanksgiving to his Father for revealing these things to babes, and not
to the wise: 'Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight,' Luke
x. 21. Have you never heard of changes wrought in the spirits of men
against their worldly interest, when they have been made the scorn of
their friends, and a reproach to their neighbours? Can the weakness of
means write a law so deep in the heart, that neither sly allurements nor
blustering temptations can raze out; that a law of a day's standing in
the heart should be able to mate the powers of hell, the cavils of the
flesh, and discouragements from the world, when there are no
unanswerable miracles now to seal the gospel, and second the proposals
of it with amazement in the minds of men? The weakness of the means, and
the greatness of the difficulties, speaks it not only to be the finger
but the arm of God, which causes the triumphs of the foolishness of
preaching. When the proposal crosses the interest of the flesh,
restrains the beloved pleasure, teaches a man the necessity of the
contempt of the world, and that men should exchange their pride for
humility, the pleasure of sin for a life of holiness; for a man not only
to cease to love his vice, but extremely to hate it; to have divine
flights, when before he could not have a divine thought; to put off
earthly affections for heavenly, and all this by the foolishness of
preaching, it is an argument of a divine power, rather than any inherent
strength in the means themselves.

(3.) The differences in the changes of men evidence this to be the work
of God, and that it is from some power superior to the means which are
used. As God puts a difference between men in regard of their
understandings, revealing that to one man which he does not to another,
so he puts a difference between men in regard of their wills, working
upon some and not upon others, working upon some that have known less,
and not working upon some that have known more, some embracing it, and
others rejecting it. We may see,

\[1.\] The difference of this change in men under the same means. One is
struck at a sermon, when multitudes return unshaken. Why is not the case
equal in all, if it were from the power of the word? How successful is
Peter's discourse, closely accusing the Jews of the murdering of their
Lord and Saviour, which is the occasion of pricking three thousand
hearts? Yet Stephen using the same method, and close application of the
same doctrine, Acts vii. 62, had not one convert upon record. While
Peter's hearers were pricked in their hearts, these gnashed with their
teeth, ver. 54. The corruption of the former was drawn out by the
pricking of their souls, the malice of the latter exasperated by the cut
of their hearts. What reason can be rendered of so different an event
from one and the same means in several hands, but the overruling
pleasure of God? The reasons were the same, set off with the same human
power; the hearers were many of the same nation, brought up in the
reading of the prophets, full of the expectations of a Messiah; they had
both reasons and natural desires for happiness, as well as the other,
yet the one are turned lambs, and the others worse lions than before;
the bloody fury of the one is calmed, and the mad rage of the other is
increased. The grace of God wrought powerfully in the one, and lighted
not upon the other. Two are grinding at the same mill of ordinances, one
is taken and another is left. Man breathes into the ears, and God into
what heart he pleases.

\[2.\] The differences in the changes of men under less means. One is
changed by weaker means, another remains in his unregeneracy under means
in themselves more powerful and likely; some are wrought upon by
whispers, when others are stiff under thunders. The Ninevites by one
single sermon from a prophet are moved to repentance; the Capernaites,
by many admonitions from a greater than all the prophets, seconded with
miracles, are not a jot persuaded; some remain refractory under great
blasts, while others bend at lighter breathings. One man may be more
acute than another, of a more apprehensive reason; yet this man remains
obstinate, whilst another becomes pliable. Whence does this difference
arise, but from the will of God drawing the one, and reusing the other
to the conduct of his own will, since both will acknowledge what they
are advised to, to be their interest, to be true in itself, necessary
for their good, yet their affections and entertainment are not the same?
Some of those Jews who had heard the doctrine of Christ, seen the purity
of his life and the power of his miracles, admired his wisdom, yet
crucified his person; they expected a Messiah, yet contemned him when he
came; when the poor thief who, perhaps, had never seen one miracle, nor
heard one sermon of our Saviour, believes in him, acknowledges him to be
the Son of God, whom he saw condemned to the same death with himself,
and dies a regenerate man under great disadvantages. A figure (says one)
of all the elect, who shall only be saved by grace, and a clear
testimony of an outstretched arm of grace. Those that our blessed
Saviour admonished only as a doctor and teacher were unmoved, none
stirred but those he wrought upon as a creator.

\[3.\] Difference of the success of the same means in different places.
How various was the success of the apostles in several parts of their
circuits! Paul finds a great door of faith opened at Corinth, and in
Macedonia, and his nets empty at Athens; multitudes flocking in at one
place, and few at another. He is entertained at Corinth, stoned at
Lystra, Acts xiv. 19, in danger of his life at Jerusalem, while the
Galatians were so affected with the gospel, that they could have 'pulled
out their eyes' for him. The apostle was the same person in all places;
the gospel was the same, and had a like power in itself; men had the
same reasons, they were all fragments from the lump of Adam: the
difference must be then from the influence of the divine Spirit, who
rained down his grace in one place and not in another; on one heart, and
not on another; who left darkness in Egypt, while he diffused light in
Goshen.

\[4.\] Difference in the same person. What is the reason that a man
believes at one time under the proposal of weak arguments, and not at
another under stronger? It is not *ex parte objecti*, for that was more
visible and credible in itself, when attended by strong arguments, than
when accompanied with weaker. Perhaps God has stricken a man's
conscience before, and he has undone that work, shaken off those
convictions; he has contended with his maker, and mustered up the power
of nature against the alarms of conscience; struggled like a wild bull
in a net, and broke it, and blunted those darts which stuck in his soul;
he has afterwards been screwed up again, and the arrow shot so deep,
that with all his pulling he could not draw it out. What but a divine
hand holds it in, in spite of all the former triumphs of nature? How
come convictions at last to be fixed upon men, which many a time before
did but flutter about the soul, and were soon chased away? And God by
such a method keeps up the honour of his grace in men after
regeneration, and teaches them the constant acknowledgement of his power
in the whole management. Do we not daily find that the same reasonings
and considerations which quicken us at one time in the ways of God stir
us not at another, no more than a child can a millstone; that we are
quickened by the same word at one time, under which we were dull and
stupid at another; and the same truth is deliciously swallowed by us,
which seemed unsavoury at another, because God edges it with a secret
virtue at one time more than another? Hereby God would mind us to own
him as the author of all our grace, the second grace as well as the
first. Upon all these considerations this can be no other than the work
of God. Can a corrupt creature elevate himself from a state of being
hated by God, to a state of being delighted in by him? Satan's work none
can judge it to be; the destroyer of mankind would never be the
restorer; the most malicious enemy to God would never contribute to the
rearing a temple to God in the soul, who has usurped God's worship in
all parts of the world. Good angels could never do it, they wonder at
it; the wisdom of God in thus creating all things in Jesus Christ is
made known to them by it, Eph. iii. 9, 10. They never ascribed it to
themselves; if they did, they could never have been good, their goodness
consisting in praising of God, and giving him his due. Good men never
did it; the first planters of the gospel (whereby it is wrought) always
gave God the praise of it, and acknowledged both their own action, and
the success, to be the effect of the grace of God, and upon every
occasion admired it, Acts xi. 21, 23. It was 'the hand of the Lord' and
'the grace of God.'

III\. The third general head, from what principles in God it flows, or
what perfections of God are eminent in this work of regeneration. What
is observable in the forming Christ in the womb of the virgin, is
observable in the forming Christ in the heart of a believer: grace to
choose her to be the holy vessel; sovereignty to pitch upon her rather
than any other of the lineage of David; truth to his promise in forming
him in the womb of a virgin, and one of the house of David; wisdom and
power in the formation of him in a virgin's womb, above the power of
nature; mercy bears the first sway as the motive of the decree, but in a
way of sovereignty to call out some, and not others; truth to himself
obliges, after sovereign mercy had made the resolution; wisdom steps in
to contrive the best way to accomplish what mercy had moved, and
sovereignty had decreed; holiness rises up as the pattern; and power
rides out for the execution. Mercy moves, sovereignty decrees, truth
obliges, wisdom counsels, holiness regulates, power executes.

1\. Mercy and goodness is a principal perfection of God, illustrious in
this work. 'Born not of the will of man, but of God,' of the will of his
mercy. Plato thought that heroes were born "ex erotos Theon", from the
love of God; divine love brings forth an heroic Christian into the
world; all outward mercies are streams of God's goodness, but those are
but trifles if compared with this. There is as much of God in imparting
the holiness of his nature as in imputing the righteousness of his soul.
We are justified by Christ, quickened by grace, saved by grace; grace is
the womb of every spiritual blessing. To be delivered from places and
company wherein we have occasions and temptations to sin, is an act
which God owns as the fruit of his mercy: 'I brought thee out of the
land of Ur of the Chaldees,' Gen. xv. 7, an idolatrous place; it is a
greater fruit of his goodness to be delivered from a nature which is the
seed-plot of sin. 'He heals our backslidden nature,' because he 'loves
us freely.' It is therefore called grace, which is not only goodness and
mercy, but goodness with a more beautiful varnish and ornamental dress.

(1.) Therefore in this take notice of the peculiarity of mercy. Such a
goodness that not one fallen angel ever had, or ever shall have a mite
of; neither did mercy excite one good thought in God of new polishing
any of those rebellious creatures; mercy cast no eye upon them, but
justice left them to their malicious obstinacy. That the rivers of
living water should refuse to run in such a channel, or flow out of such
a belly, to run in the heart of a man more muddy! As peculiar grace
pitched upon the very flesh of Christ, to be limited to the second
person, so the like grace pitches upon this or that particular soul, to
be united to the body of Christ. That singular love which chose Christ
for the head, chose some men in him to be his members: 'Chosen us in
him,' Eph. i. 4. And the anointing which is upon the head is poured out
by such a peculiarity of love upon the members, not only by an act of
his power as God, but by an act of appropriated goodness, thy God, Heb.
i. 9. God anoints his fellows with that holy gracious unction, as their
God, not only as God; for anointing him as the head, under that
particular consideration, he anoints also his fellows, his members,
under the same consideration too, because he is as well their God, the
God of the members, as well as the God of the head, for they are his
fellows in that unction; the difference lies in the greater portion of
grace given to the human nature of Christ. And the apostle Peter, 1
Peter i. 3, intimates in his thanksgiving to God, that God begot us as
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: 'Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ,' the paternal affection he bears to Christ being
the ground of the regeneration of his people; the paternal affection
first pitching upon Christ, then upon others in him. Indeed, it is a
peculiar affection. In his mercy to the world, he acts as a rector or
governor, in that relation he proposes laws, makes offers of peace,
urges them in his word, strives with men by his Spirit, enduing men with
reason, and deals with them as rational creatures; he uses affections
and mercies, which might soften their hearts, did they not wilfully
indulge themselves in their hardness. This is his rectoral mercy, or his
mercy as a governor, and as much as his relation of a governor can
oblige him to. If men will not change their lives, is God bound as a
governor to force them to it, or not rather to punish them for it? But
in regeneration there is a choicer affection, whereby, besides the
relation of a governor, he puts on that of a father, and makes an inward
and thorough change in some which he has chosen into the relation of
children. As a father, who cannot persuade his son lying under a mortal
distemper to take that physic which is necessary for saving his life,
will compel him to it, open his month, and pour it in; but as he is a
governor of his servant, he will provide it for him, and propose it to
him. To do thus is kindness to his servant, though he does not manifest
so peculiar an affection as he does to his son. God governs men as he is
the author of nature; he renews men as he is the author of grace; he is
the lawgiver and governor; it does not follow that where he is so he
should be the new creator too; this is a peculiar indulgence.

(2.) As there is a peculiarity of mercy, so there is the largeness of
his mercy and goodness in this work. It was his goodness to create us,
but a full sea of goodness made us new creatures: 1 Peter i. 3, 'Who
according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to 'a lively
hope,' "kata to polu autou eleos". His own mercy, without any other
motive; much mercy, without any parsimony, not an act of ordinary
goodness, but the deepest bowels of kindness, an everlasting spring of
goodness, an exuberance of goodness. The choice love he bears to them in
election cannot be without some real act; it is a vain love that does
not operate; one great part of affection is to imitate the party
beloved; but since that is unworthy of God to imitate a corrupt
creature, he performs the other act of love, which is to assimilate us
to himself, and bring us into a state of imitation of him, endowing us
with principles of resemblance to him. It is abundant mercy to love
them; it is much more goodness to render them worthy of his love, and
inspire them with those qualities, as effects of his love of
benevolence, which may be an occasion of his love of complacency.
Worldly mercies do many times, yea, for the most part (if you view the
whole globe of the earth) consist with his hatred, but this is a beam
from a clear sun. At best other benefits are but the mercies of his
hand, this of his heart. In those he makes men like others of a higher
rank, in this like himself.

\[1.\] It is a goodness greater than that in creation. It is more an act
of kindness to reform that which is deformed, than to form it at the
beginning, because it is more to have a happy than a simple being. To
repair what is decayed is a testimony of greater goodness than at first
to raise it. Creation is terminated to the good of a mutable nature,
regeneration is terminated to a supernatural good, and partaking of the
divine nature. The creation was an emanation of his goodness, never
entitled the work of his grace. Man's first uprightness was an impress
of God; his second uprightness is far more pleasing to him, as being the
fruit of his Son's death, wherein all his attributes are more highly
glorified. It is a regeneration 'by the resurrection of Christ,' 1 Peter
i. 3; that being the perfection of it, includes his death, which is the
foundation of it, as the perfection of a thing includes the beginning.
God pronounced all the structures of the first creation good, but not
with those magnificent titles of his delighting in it, forming it for
himself, that it might show forth his praise, which expressions testify
a greater efflux of his goodness in this second creation. Nor did Christ
ever say his delight was in that, or in that one man Adam, but in the
sons of men, of apostate Adam, as to be redeemed and renewed by him
after their apostasy: Prov. viii. 31, 'My delights were with the sons of
men.' What sons of men? The exhortation, ver. 32, intimates it, those
that are his children renewed by him that hearken to him and keep his
ways. God pronounced it good, but not his treasure, his portion, his
inheritance, his *segullah*, his house, his diadem. All those things
which he made, even the noblest heaven, as well as the lowest earth, he
overlooks and speaks slightly of them: Isa. lxvi. 1, 2, 'All those
things has my hand made, and all those things have been,' &c., to fix
his eyes, "avit", upon a contrite spirit, a renewed nature. He speaks of
them as things passed away, and is intent only upon the new creation;
values it above heaven and earth, and all the ceremonial worship. What
is the object of his greatest estimation partakes of a greater efflux of
his goodness to make it so. And the apostle Peter aggrandises this
abundant mercy in regeneration, from the term, 'unto a lively hope;' not
such an uncertain hope as Adam had when he was fullest of his mutable
uprightness; a living hope, "elpida dzosan", that grows up more and more
into life, till it comes to an inheritance that fades not away as Adam's
did. Surely there is more of bowels in the Spirit's brooding over a
sinful soul, to bring forth this beautiful frame, than in brooding over
the confused mass to bring forth a world.

\[2.\] All the grace and goodness God has is employed in it. In the
creation you cannot say, all the goodness of God was displayed, as not
all his power nor all his wisdom: for as to his power he might have made
millions of worlds inconceivably more beautiful and more wisely
contrived; for though there be no defect of wisdom and power, yet
neither of those attributes were exerted to that height that they might
have been. So for his goodness, he might have made millions of more
angels and men than he did create, with as (and more) illustrious
natures; for a man may conceive something more than God has displayed in
the creation, as to the extensiveness of his perfections at least. But
in this God has displayed, as it may seem, the utmost of his grace, for
no man or angel can conceive a higher grace than what God shows in this,
of beginning in man a likeness to himself, and perfecting it hereafter
to as high a pitch as a creature is capable of. Therefore called
'unsearchable riches of Christ,' Eph. hi. 7. A further good cannot be
imagined or found out than what is there displayed. Therefore the
apostle Peter speaks of God as effectually calling us into his eternal
glory by Christ, under the title of ' the God of all grace,' 1 Peter v.
10, which calling includes all preparation for glory. All grace does not
less fit us for it, than call us to it, there is more of grace in
fitting us for it than barely in calling us to it; and the call itself
has more of grace in it than the giving the possession of that
inheritance you are called unto. It is not so high a favour in a prince
actually to set his royal bride in the throne with him, as to call her
to and prepare her for so high a dignity. To prepare a soul for it by
regeneration is an act of pure grace; to give it after a preparation for
it, is an act of truth as well as grace; nothing obliged him to the
first, his promise binds him to the latter. What if I should say, this
renewing of us, and subduing our sins in us, is a greater act of grace
than a bare remission! Micah vii. 18, 19, seems to favour it. To pardon
us is an act of his delightful mercy; but to subdue our iniquities is an
act of his most tender compassion. Mercy is there joined with pardon,
and compassion with subduing And the latter expression, 'Thou wilt cast
all their sins into the depths of the sea,' may refer to both those acts
of grace, against the guilt and filth of sin.

\[3.\] The freeness of his mercy is manifest in it. It is as free as
election: Eph. i. 3, 4, 'Who has blessed us with all spiritual
blessings' (of which regeneration is none of the meanest), 'according as
he has chosen us in him', "kathos exelexato". It is as free in the
stream as it is in the fountain. Jesus Christ is as freely formed in us,
as we were freely chosen in him, as freely, *quoad* *nos*, as to us, not
in regard of Christ, who merited the former though not the latter. It is
his own mercy, 1 Peter i. 3, 'his own will,' James i. 18, not moved by
any other, as we do many things by the will of others when our own are
not free, in which are mixed acts. It is in regard of this freeness
called grace. Supposing God would create man, and for such an end as to
enjoy blessedness, he could not create him otherwise than with a
universal rectitude, because, had God created him with a temper contrary
to his law, he had been the author of his sin. Some therefore call not
the righteousness of Adam grace, because it was a perfection due to his
nature upon his creation. But there was no necessity upon God to bestow
new creating grace, after he had stripped himself of the righteousness
of his first creation. And also supposing God will restore man to that
end from which he fell, and refit him for that blessedness, he cannot
fit him otherwise than by restoring him to that righteousness, as a
means of attaining that blessedness. Yet both these are free, because
the original foundation of both is free. God might choose whether he
would create man when he was nothing, and choose whether he would
restore man when he was fallen. Yet there is more freedom in this latter
than in the former, in regard of the measures of the new created
righteousness, and in regard of the immutability of it, in regard also
of demerit. Adam's dust, before creation, as it could merit nothing, so
it had an advantage above us that it could not lie under demerit. But
we, after the fall, are in a state of damnation, children of wrath, so
that regeneration is not a creating us from nothing, but recovering us
from a state worse than nothing. In regard that man was miserable, he
was capable of mercy; but as he was a criminal, he was an object of
severity. That is free mercy to renew any man by grace, when he might
have damned him by justice, to work him for glory when he had wrought
himself for damnation. The apostle therefore excludes all works
whatsoever from any meritoriousness in this case: Titus iii. 5, 'Not by
works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he
saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost.' I say, he excludes all works, because not one work, as good, was
in being before the renewal of the soul, for so verse 3 plainly implies,
when he concludes all men, himself too, in a state incapable of doing
anything that was good; the honour of his truth indeed excites him to
perfect it, but his grace only, without any other motive, moves him to
bestow it. All the grace you have in regeneration sprung only from this;
the righteousness you are arrayed with, the flames of love in your
hearts, the flights of your faith, cost you nothing, they were all the
births of love. Goodness decreed all when you were nothing, grace formed
all when you were worse than nothing, your faith is 'the faith of God's
elect,' Titus i. 1. New creatures were chosen to faith by grace, and by
the same grace was faith formed in the womb of the soul; electing grace
preceded, renewing grace followed, the stream cannot be merited when the
spring was free. Regeneration is an accessory to election. No man can
merit the principle, therefore not the accessory.

2\. As mercy and goodness, so the sovereignty of God is illustrious in
this work. 'Of God,' in the text, is 'of the will of God.' The covenant
runs in a royal style: 'I will put my Spirit into them; I will give a
heart of flesh,' of my own free motion and good pleasure, like the
patents of princes. God reserves this in his own power, to give to whom
he pleases; Cameron says, that faith, which is a great constitutive part
of regeneration, was not purchased meritoriously by Christ's death; and
though Christ does give us faith as well as repentance, yet he does
that, not as considered as a satisfier of God's justice in his death,
but as God's commissioner in his exaltation, being empowered by God to
give the conditions upon which they agreed together in the first compact
about the work of mediation, unto all those that God had given him to
satisfy for. Whether this opinion be well grounded or no, I will not
determine; yet the making it depend solely upon election, and to be
given as a fruit of election, that hereby we may be partakers of Christ,
makes it more fully depend upon the sovereignty of God. God renews when
he pleases. 'The wind blows where it lists,' John iii. 8. To some he
affords means, to others not; he deals not with every nation as he dealt
with Israel. In some, he works by means; to others, he gives only the
means without any inward work; it is his pleasure that he works upon any
one to will, his good pleasure that he gives to and one to do: Philip.
ii. 13, 'of his good pleasure.' Some hear the word, others the Spirit in
the word; some feel the striking of the air upon their ear, others the
stamp of the Spirit upon their hearts. Who chose this rough stone to hew
and polish, and let others lie in the quarry? Who frames this for a
statue, a representation of himself, and leaves another upon the
pavement? What does all this result from, but his sovereign pleasure?

(1.) No ultimate reason can be rendered for this distinction, but God's
sovereignty. We can render an immediate reason of some actions of God:
why the heavens are round, because that is the most capacious figure,
and fittest for motion; why the sun is the centre of the world, as some
think, because it may, at a convenient distance, enlighten the stars
above, and quicken the things below; why our hearts are in the midst of
our bodies, because they may more commodiously afford heat to all the
members; so also, why God loved Adam, because he saw his own image in
him; why he sends judgments upon the world, because of sin; why he saves
believers and condemns unbelievers, because they receive the grace of
Christ, those reject it. We have not recourse immediately to God's will
for a reason; the nature of the things themselves affords us one,
obvious to us. But no reason can be rendered of other actions of God but
his good pleasure. Why he chose Abraham above other men, and delivered
him from Ur of the Chaldees; why Israel above other nations, since all
other men and nations descended from Adam and Noah, and they were in
their natures equally corrupt with others; they were not in themselves
better than others, nor other nations worse than they; so in Esau and
Jacob, why the elder should serve the younger, since they both issued
from the same parents, lay in the same womb, were equally depraved in
their nature, had original sin equally conveyed to them by their
parents: no reason can be rendered but the will of God. So, if it be
asked, why men are condemned, because they do not believe. Why do they
not believe? Because they will not. God has given them means and
faculties. If you ask, why God did not give them grace to believe and
turn their wills, no other answer can be given but because he will not.
It is his free will to choose some and not others. Election is put upon
his pleasure: Eph. i. 5, 'Predestinated according to the good pleasure
of his will;' and the making known the mystery of his will is put upon
his pleasure: Eph. i. 9, 'Having made known unto us the mystery of his
will according to his good pleasure.' As God regards us absolutely, it
is rather mercy than his good pleasure. Why has he changed our wills?
Because he loved us, and bare good will to us in his everlasting
purpose, to which he was incited by his own mercy. But if we compare
ourselves with others, and ask, why he renews this man and not that,
then it is rather an act of the sovereign liberty of his will, for there
cannot be the result of any reason from any thing else; he pitches his
compassion where and upon whom he pleases. The apostle joins mercy and
this sovereignty of his will together: Rom. ix. 15, 'I will have mercy
on whom I will have mercy; and I will have compassion on whom I will
have compassion.' He is so absolute a sovereign, that he will give no
account of these matters but his own good pleasure. Why he renews any
man is merely voluntary; why he saves renewed men is just; why he
justifies those that believe is justice to Christ and mercy to them; but
why he bestows faith on any is merely the good pleasure of his will. The
pharisees believed not, because they were not of Christ's sheep, John x.
26; that is, they were not given to Christ by the Father, as is
intimated, verse 29. And the prosperity of those which are given to
Christ is resolved wholly into the pleasure of God: 'The pleasure of the
Lord shall prosper in his hand,' Isa. liii. 10. In all our searches into
the cause of this, we must rest in his sovereign pleasure; our Saviour
himself renders this only as a reason of his distinguishing mercy,
wherein himself does, and therefore we must, acquiesce: Mat. xi. 27,
'Even so, Father, for so it pleased thee.'

(2.) We may well do so, because he is no debtor to any man in the way of
grace. There is nothing due to man but death; that is his wages; the
other is a gift: Rom. vi. 23, 'To you it is given to know the mysteries
of the kingdom of heaven, to them it is not given,' Mat. xiii. 11. Who
shall control him in the disposal of his own goods? 'Who shall say unto
him, What dost thou?' Grace is his own treasure; if he gives the riches
of it to any, it is his pleasure; if he will not bestow a mite on any
man, it is no wrong; 'if any man has given to him, it shall be
recompensed to him again,' Rom. xi. 35. It is not unjust with God to
deny every man grace; it is not then unjust to deny a great part of men
this grace: 'Who has enjoined him his way?' says Job; or, 'Who can say,
Thou hast wrought iniquity?' Job xxxvi. 23. He is not to be taught by
man how to govern the world, neither can any man justly blame him, if
they judge aright of his actions. Though every man is bound to endeavour
the conversion of others, and every good man has so much charity that he
would turn all to righteousness if he could, and though the love of God
is infinitely greater than man's, it cannot be argued from thence that
therefore God should renew every man. This charity in man is a debt he
owes to his neighbour by communion of blood, upon which the law of
charity is founded, which obliges him to endeavour the happiness and
welfare of his neighbour; but God is free from the engagements of any
law, but the liberty of his own will; he is under no government but his
own; he has none superior, none equal with him, to enjoin him his way,
and to prescribe him rules and methods. If he gives any favour to man,
it is his pleasure; if man improves it well, God is not indebted to him,
and obliged to give him more, no more than a father is bound to give his
son a new stock, because he has improved well the first he has entrusted
him with; it depends only upon his pleasure.

(3.) God's proceedings in this case do wholly declare it. In the first
gift of his people to Christ, he acted like a God greater than all in a
way of super-eminent sovereignty: 'My Father which gave them me is
greater than all', John x. 29. He acts as a potter with his clay; he
softens one heart, and leaves another to its natural hardness. He
converts Paul a persecutor, but none of the other pharisees who spurred
him on in that fury and commissioned him to it; he snatches some from
the embracements of lust, while he suffers others to run their race to
hell. David, by grace, is made a man after God's own heart, and Saul
left to be a man after his own will; some he changes in the heat of
their pursuit of sinful pleasures, others he wounds to death by his
judgments. The reason of the latter is deserved justice; the reason of
the other is undeserved pleasure. He chooses the mean things of the
world to be highest in his favour, and passes over those that the world
esteems most excellent. 'Not many wise, not many mighty,' is his
sovereign method. The amiable endowments esteemed by the men of the
world have no influence upon him. He acts in this way with his own
people; he gives sometimes to will, when he does not give presently to
do; he distributes greater measures of grace to one than to another; he
sometimes excites them by his grace, sometimes lets them lie as logs
before him, that he may be owned by them to be a free agent. And
further, it must needs be thus, because God does not work in
regeneration as a natural agent, and put forth his strength to the
utmost; as the sun shines, and the fire burns, *ad extremum virium*,
unless a cloud interpose to hinder the one, or water quench the other,
but as an arbitrary agent, who exerts his power according to his own
will, and withholds it according to his pleasure. For there are two acts
of his sovereign will: one whereby he does command men to do their duty,
promises rewards, and threatens punishment, but the subject is to be
disposed to do God's will of precept. Here comes in another act of his
sovereignty, whereby he wills the disposing such and such hearts to the
accepting of his grace, and does will not to give others that grace, but
leave them to themselves. This we see practised by God almost in every
day's experience.

3\. The truth of God is apparent in this work. Truth to his own purpose:
1 Tim. i. 9, 'Who has called us with a holy calling, according to his
own purpose and grace, which was given us in Jesus Christ before the
world began.' Sovereignty first singles this or that man out; and truth
to that firm and immutable counsel, and that resolve in his own mind,
steps in to excite his holiness, wisdom, and power, to make every such
person conformed to the image of his Son. It was not from any truth
respecting any condition annexed to any promise he had made which he
might find in the creature, for the apostle plainly excludes it, 'not
according to our work'; for what motion can our work in a state of
nature cause in God but that of anger and aversion arising from truth to
his threatening, the condition whereof is fulfilled by us, but not one
mite of good fruit that could as a condition challenge this great work
at the hands of the truth of God by virtue of his promise. His truth to
his threatening would have raised up thoughts of destroying men; his
truth to his purpose carried on his design of effectually calling them.
It is not an engagement of truth to his creature, but of truth to
himself. So that if you ask why he has Peter, Paul, and others, since
many better conditioned than they have rejected the gospel, the answer
is, because he had so purposed in himself; and he is faithful, and
cannot deny his own counsel, for that were to deny himself, and that
eternal idea in his own mind: 2 Tim. ii. 13, 'He is faithful, and cannot
deny himself,' in regard of his purpose, in regard of his absolute
promise. Truth to his promise; his promise to his Son, for so Titus i. 2
is principally to be understood: 'In hope of eternal life, which God,
that cannot lie, promised before the world began.' There was a donation
of some made to Christ, and a donation of grace to Christ for them,
deposited in his hands as a treasure to be dispensed to every one of
them in their proper time. His truth comes in upon this double donative:
a donative of grace to them in Christ, before the world began, which
would be but as a useless rusty treasure, if not bestowed upon those for
whom it was entrusted in his hands; a donative of some, according to
this purpose, to Christ, whose death, and resurrection, and purchase,
would be ineffectual, if those thus given were not in time engrafted in
him, and renewed by him, to be made partakers of all that which he
purchased and preserved for them. Jesus Christ was to have a seed by
covenant, a people to be conformed to his image. The issue then of
forming a people for his seed, is the effect of God's truth to Christ.
And consequent to this antecedent purpose in himself, and promise to
Christ, he gives him an order to bring in those that were thus designed
to be his sheep, which he calls his sheep by right of donation, before
they were renewed: my sheep, by right of gift from my Father, mine by
right of purchase at my death, mine by right of possession at their
effectual call, these I must bring in; not I may, but I must; and they
shall hear my voice: John x. 16, 'Other sheep I have; them also I must
bring, and they shall hear my voice;' not they may, but they shall be
inclined to comply with my word and call. Satan and their own lusts
shall not hinder them from coming unto me, but they shall be overruled
by a powerful Spirit. So that there is truth to his purpose, truth to
his promise to Christ' truth to the *depositum* in Christ's hands, truth
to his word published, that he would give a new heart. So that
whatsoever heart his work is wrought in, it is a manifest effect of the
truth of God to himself and his Christ. The gift of grace, in
possession, is a necessary consequent of that gift of it, in purpose,
before the world began.

4\. The wisdom of God appears in this work. The secrets of wisdom shine
forth in the great concerns of the soul in Christ, who is made wisdom
principally to us in our sanctification, as well as righteousness and
redemption. Wisdom in the imputation of righteousness, in the draught of
sanctification, and in the perfection of it in a complete redemption;
wisdom, like thread, runs through every part of the web. The new birth
is the great wisdom of the creature; by this he becomes wise, since the
Scripture entitles all fools without it. The inspiration of this wisdom
can own no other but divine wisdom for the author. It is his own wisdom;
for 'Who has been his counsellor?' Rom. xi. 34. He works all things
according to the counsel of his own will, freely, wisely; a work of his
will, a work of his understanding: Eph. i. 11, 12, 'Who works all things
according to the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the
praise of his glory,' that the glory of the Father may shine out in us.
If all things are thus wrought with the choicest counsel, much more the
rarest work of God in the world. If all things are wrought with counsel,
because he will have a praise from them, much more that from whence he
expects to gather the greatest crop of glory. The bringing us to trust
in Christ is for the praise of his glory; a glory redounds to him,
because there is nothing of our own in it, but all his; a farther glory
redounds to him, because it is in the wisest manner. It is to the praise
and the glory of his goodness in the act of his will; to the praise of
the glory of his wisdom in the act of his counsel. There was a mystery
of wisdom in the first secretion and singling out this or that person; a
revelation of wisdom in the preparations to it, and formation of it. If
there be much of his counsel in the minute passages of his providence in
the lowest creatures, which are the subjects of that providence, much
more must there be in the framing the soul to be a living monument of
his glory. It is not a new moulding the outward case of the body, but
the inward jewel wrapped up from the view of men; the spirit of the
mind, which, being more excellent, requires more of skill for the new
forming of it.

(1.) The nature of the new birth declares it to be an effect of his
wisdom. It is a building a divine temple, a spiritual tabernacle, for
his own residence: 'ye are God's building,' 1 Cor. iii. 9. Strength will
not build a house without art to contrive and proportion the materials;
skill is the chief requisite of an architect. The highest pieces of art
come from the most excellent idea in the creature. The beautiful fabric
of grace is modelled by the wisest idea in God; that which is glorious
in the erection, supposes excellent skill in the contrivance. Every
renewed man is a 'lively stone:' 1 Pet. ii. a, 'Ye also as lively
stones,' every one of you polished and carved by the wise Creator for an
everlasting statue. It is he that has 'wrought us to the self-same
thing,' 2 Cor. v. 6, "katergasamenos"; polished us and curiously wrought
us, who were rough stones, covered with the rubbish of sin. As a wise
builder, he lays the foundation in sound habits, whereon to raise a
superstructure of gracious actions. The counterpart in the heart is no
less a fruit of his wisdom than the law in the tables of stone; wisdom
in the first framing the law, wisdom also in the deep imprinting of it.
That which enlightens the eyes, and makes wise to salvation, can be
entitled to no other original cause than divine wisdom. The soul is a
rational work of God. Surely, then, that which is the soul of the soul,
the glory of the creature, the preparation for happiness, more pleasing
to God than the brightest nature, than the natural frame of the highest
soul, that which is the pleasure and delight, must be the fruit, too, of
infinite wisdom. Bare effects of power are not the immediate objects of
God's special delight.

(2.) The means of it declare it to be a fruit of his wisdom. Christ the
exemplar has the treasures of wisdom; grace copied from it is part of
those treasures. The gospel, the instrument, is 'the wisdom of God,' as
well as 'the power of God,' 1 Cor. ii. 7. Divine skill framed the model,
reared the building, no less sows the seed in the heart. What did
partake of wisdom in the contrivance, progress, all the parts and
methods of it, partakes of the same in the inward operations of it upon
the soul.

(3.) The manner of it speaks it to be so. In regard of the enemies he
has to deal with, there must be prudence to countermine the deep and
unsearchable plots of the powers of darkness. As there is the strength
of sin within, the might of Satan without, as fit subjects for his
power, so there are the stratagems of Satan, the subtleties and deceits
of the flesh, as a fit occasion for his almighty skill against hellish
policy. In regard also of his working upon the soul, he works upon those
that are so contrary to his design without imposing upon their
faculties; he moves them according to their physical nature, though
contrary to their moral nature; he makes us do willingly what we would
not; he so tunes the strings that they speak out willingly what
naturally they are most unfit for. The Spirit acts wisely in the
revealing to us the knowledge of Christ, as Eph. i. 17, 'The spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him,' which may note the
manner of his acting in the revelation, which is the first work of the
soul, as well as the effect it does produce, though I suppose the effect
is principally meant. Some question the wisdom of God in acting so upon
the will as not to lease it to its own indifference in this change. What
reason is there to question his wisdom? Do not the angels in heaven
admire God's wisdom as well as his grace, who has immutably fixed them
to that which is good? Do they question the wisdom of God for so happy a
confirmation of them against that indifference which destroyed some of
their fellows by creation? But is there not an evident art in this work,
to make the will willing that had no affection to this change; to fit
the key so to all the wards that not one is disordered; to move us
contrary to our corrupt reason, yet bring us to that pass to acknowledge
we had reason to be so moved; to move our faculties one by another as
wheels in a watch; to present spiritual things with such an evident
light as engages our understandings to believe that which they would not
believe before, and our wills to embrace that which our affections
gainsay? It must therefore be a fruit of divine skill since it is a
fruit of divine teaching, John vi. 45.

(4.) There is a greater wisdom in it than in the creation of the world.
The higher the work rises, the more of skill appears. It is a divine art
to make man to live the life of plants in his growth, the life of beasts
in his sense, the life of angels in his mind; more it is then to make
him live the life of God in his grace. Man in his body partakes of
earth, in his soul of heaven, in his grace of the heaven of heavens, of
the God of heaven. The grace in the new birth is nearer the likeness of
God than the figure of men in the first birth. God therefore does more
observe the numbers and measures in the second creation than he did in
the first. Man was the most excellent piece in the lower creation,
therefore more of art in the framing of him than in the whole celestial
and elementary world. The glorious bodies of sun, moon, and stars had
not such marks upon them. The nearer resemblance anything has to God,
the more of wisdom as well as power is signified in the make of it.

(5.) The holiness of God is seen in this work. The day of God's power
breaks not upon us in the change of our wills, without his appearance in
'the beauties of holiness,' Ps. cx. 3. The Spirit is called a spirit of
holiness, not only as he is the efficient, but as he is the pattern, and
like fire transforms into his own nature; for that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit. The law in the tables of stone was an image; the law
in the heart is an extract of God's holiness. Our first creation in a
mutable state was according to his own image, Gen. i. 26. Our second
creation is more exactly like him, in a gracious immutability. The
holiness in Christ's human nature was an effect of the holiness of God;
the holiness we have then in resemblance to Christ, must be a fruit of
the same perfection. If we are renewed according to his image, it must
be according to his holiness. To be merciful and just, is to have a
moral image; to be holy, is to have a divine. The apostle intimates this
in his exhortation, we must be holy in serving him, because he was holy
in calling us: 1 Peter i. 16, 'As he which has called you is holy, so be
ye holy,' &c. In this respect, God calls himself, not only a holy one,
but the holy one of Israel: Isa. xliii. 15, 'I am the Lord your holy
one, the creator of Israel, your king.' He is not only holy in himself,
but displays his holiness in them, by an act of a new creation. By
*creator* is not meant, his being the creator of them, as he is of all,
even of wicked men and devils; but implies a peculiar relation to them,
as distinguished from others. He is the creator of devils, holy in his
actions towards devils, but not their *holy one* by any inward
renovation, or consecrating them to himself, as he is the holy one of
Israel. As he is a God in covenant, he is our God, therefore our God as
he is a holy God, as well as he is a powerful God, communicating the one
as well as the other in a covenant way, therefore the prophet Habakkuk
joins them both together, 'O Lord my God, my holy one,' Hab. i. 12. His
holiness is no less necessary for the felicity of his people, than his
mercy and power. What happiness could his mercy move, his wisdom
contrive, or his power effect, without the communication of his
holiness? Mercy could not of itself fit a man for it, nor power give a
man possession of it, without holiness attiring him with all those
graces which prepare him for it. God, as sovereign, chose us; as
merciful, pardons us; as wise, guides us; as powerful, protects us; as
true, makes good his promises to us; but as holy, cleanses us from our
old habits, makes us vessels of honour, filled with the savoury and
delicious fruits of his Spirit, his pleasant things. The implantation of
grace in the heart, is no less an effect of his holiness, than the
preservation of it is, which our Saviour intimates, when in his petition
for it he gives his Father rather the title of holy, than of any other
attribute: John xvii. 11, 'Holy Father, keep through thy own name.'

6\. The power of God appears in this work. 'Since the world began was it
not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind,' John
ix. 32; neither was it ever heard that any man could open the
understanding of one that was born dark. Everything that pertains to
life and godliness, of which regeneration is not the meanest, is the
work of divine power: 2 Peter i. 3, 'According as his divine power has
given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the
knowledge of him who has called us to glory and virtue;' glory and
virtue, by a *hendiadis*, for a glorious virtue; and the apostle adds,
that this calling was an effect of a glorious power; it is not "eis",
but "dia", *through* glory and virtue; the same preposition "dia",
which, as joined with knowledge, is translated *through;* as much as to
say, through a glorious virtue or power, both "agete" and *virtus*,
signifying valour and strength in their several languages. When God
hardens a man, he only withdraws his grace. But a divine virtue is
necessary for the cure of our hereditary disease. There is no great
force required to cut a dead man, but to raise him requires an
extraordinary power. We may as well deny this work to be a new creation,
a resurrection, as deny it to be an act of divine power. There is a word
that calls; there is also a power to work: 1 Thes. i. 5. 'Our gospel
came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy
Ghost;' that is, the power of the Holy Ghost. There was not only grace
in the word, to woo, but the power of the Holy Ghost in it, to overcome
the heart. There is not only an act of an almighty Spirit, but an act of
his almightyness. The hand of the Lord created the world, 'the heavens
are the work of his fingers,' Ps. viii. 3; but grace is the work of 'his
arms,' Isa. liii. 1. It may be said of the first grace in the new birth,
as it was of Reuben, Gen. xlix. 3, it is his 'might, the beginning of
his strength, and the excellency of his power.' Though ministerial gifts
were as excellent as Paul's, whose preaching was with demonstration and
power, and who knew the readiest ways to men's hearts, if a man ever
did, yet 'the excellency of the power was of God;' and when he
brandished his spiritual weapons, they were only 'mighty through God,' 2
Cor. x. 4. Though the declaration was his, yet the working was Christ's,
Rom. xv. 18; none of his people are willing, till the day of his power,
Ps. cx. 3.

(1.) It is as great, yea, greater power, than that put forth in
creation. It is as great; it is the introduction of another form, not in
a way of any action or fashion, but in such a manner as was in the
creation, that is, by the mighty operation of God; otherwise it could
not be called a new creature though it might be called a new thing. You
call not that which is made by the art or power of man, as a watch, a
clock, a house, a new creature; for there is nothing of creation in
them, but art and industry, setting the pieces of matter, created to
their hands, together in such a form or figure. But this is called a new
creature, not so much in regard of the newness of the thing, but in
regard of the power that wrought it, and the manner of working it, being
the same with that of creation. And being termed so, it implies the
exerting an efficacious power; for creation is not brought by a
cessation of action (which would be in God, if the will were only the
cause of it) but the employment of an active virtue. God does not hold
his hand in his bosom, but spreads it open, and applies it to an
efficacious action. Since it is a new creation, it implies a creator,
and a creative power, creation cannot be without both. It is a greater
power expended in regeneration than in creation; more power morally in
this, than physically in that. One word created the world; many words
are combined for the new preparation of the heart. It is easier to make
a thousand glasses, than to set together one that is dashed in pieces.
It is easier with God to make a world (*quoad nos*, as to our
conception, for all things are alike easy with God), and create
thousands of men with his image, as bright as Adam's, than to bring that
into form which is so miserably defaced.

\[1.\] First, In regard of the subject, sin has turned man into a beast,
and omnipotence only can turn a bestial man into angelical and divine.
There is a less distance between the least dust and the glorious God,
than there is between the holy God and an impure sinner; sin and grace
are more contrary to one another, than *aliquid* and *nihil*, something
and nothing. A straw may with less power be made a star, than a
corrupted sinner be made a saint. In creation, God was only to put in
nature, here he is to 'put off' one that is strong, and to bring in
another altogether strange and new, it is hard to bring a man off from
his old stock, and as hard to make him nakedly to trust Christ. It is
more difficult to make a man leave his sin, than to change his opinion,
since men are more in love with habitual wickedness than with any
opinion whatsoever. In regard of the indisposedness of the soul. There
is some foundation for a natural religion, there being general notions
of God and his attributes, which would administer some conclusions that
he was to be feared and reverenced; and according to these notions many
cheeks of conscience, which would induce men to some moral behaviour
towards God. But in the setting our hearts right to God, and creating
them in a mediator, there was not the least dust in nature to build
upon. In the creating of Adam's body, there was some pre-existent
matter, the dust of the ground, whereof his body has by a divine power
made and organised; but we meet with no pre-existent matter for the
formation of the soul, which made him a rational creature; that indeed
was the breath of God, not engendered by any concurring cause in nature.
There is no pre-existent matter in the creature, of which this image is
formed, though there be a pre-existent subject to receive the impression
of it; it is not the rearing anything upon the foundation of nature, but
introducing a nature wholly new, which speaks almightyness. In regard of
the contradiction in the subject. The stream of man's natural reason,
the principles, of self, whereby he is guided, run counter to it, there
is a pride of reason which will not stoop to the gospel, which in man's
wisdom is counted foolishness. Man is an untamed heifer, a wild ass that
snuffs up the wind, full of hatred to the ways of God, guided by
gigantic lusts, which make as great a resistance as a mountain of brass;
stoutness of heart, strong prejudices against the law of God, fierceness
of affection, drinking iniquity like water, universal madness, resisting
the spirit, hare-brained imaginations; frowardness in the will,
forwardness to evil, perversity against good; can anything, less than an
almighty power, make a universal cure? It is more easy to make men stoop
to some victorious prince, and become his vassals, than to bring men to
a submission to God and his laws, which they entertain with contempt and
scorn. Nothing obeyed God's word in the creation; though it contributed
not to his design, yet it could not oppose him, it could not swell
against him, because it has nothing. But every sinner is rebellious,
disputes God's commands, fortifies himself against his entrance, gives
not up himself without a contest. This pride is hereditary, it bore sway
in the heart ever since Adam's fall, and has prescription of as long a
standing as the world to plead for possession. What but infinite power
can fling down this pride at the foot of the cross, make the heart
strike its swelling sail to Christ, and become nothing in itself, that
Christ may be all life in him, and all righteousness to him? It is only
possible to God to make a camel, with this bunch on its back, pass
through a needle's eye; no less than divine power can bring down these
armies of opposite imaginations, which have both multitude and strength
(and no man knows either their number or strength), and the whole frame
of contradiction against the grace of Christ. Our Saviour intimates this
creative power in that thanksgiving to his Father: Matt. xi. 25, 'I
thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,' &c. Christ, in all his
addresses to his Father, used attributes and titles suitable to the
business he insisted on. The revelation of divine knowledge to babes,
the moulding their hearts to receive it, was an act of God as he is Lord
of heaven and earth, putting forth an infinite power in the forming of
it. If God were the author of grace in the hearts of those babes,
persons better disposed, and nearer the kingdom of heaven, as he was
Lord of heaven and earth, then there must be some greater power than
that of the creation of the world put forth to conquer the wise and
prudent, whose wisdom and prudence stands armed in the breaches of
nature to beat off the assaults of the gospel.

\[2.\] In regard of the opposition of the present possessors. The
chasing out an armed devil, that has kept the palace in peace so long,
must be by a power superior to his own, Luke xi. 21, 22. This great
Goliath has his armour about him, has had long possession and dearest
affections; the impulses of natural concupiscence take his part; he has
his alluring baits, his pleasing proposals; the world and the flesh are
linked with him in a league to hinder the restoration of the soul to
Christ, and the restoration of God's image to the soul. A threefold cord
is not easily broken. It must be a power superior to those three great
posters in conjunction, that must bind the strong man; and casting him
out, and spoiling his goods, are acts of power, Mat. xii. 29. Satan is
too strong to be easily cast out, and the flesh loves him too dearly to
be easily divorced from him; he is never like to lay down his arms by
persuasions; though all the angels in heaven should entreat him, he
would not give up one foot of his empire. Nay, though what God does
propose has a greater weight of goodness, pleasure, and profit in
itself, than what those three great impostors can offer, yet, since
reason is weak and mightily corrupted under the conduct of sense, which
has an alliance with Satan's proposals, and first sucks them in, it is
not like to meet with any entertainment, as being against the interest
of the flesh; and the will being backed with two such powerful seconds,
as Satan and the world, to assist it in its refusals. Indeed, if he that
is in the regenerate, were not greater and more powerful than he that is
in the world, they would not be able to resist his allurements and
subtilties, 1 John iv. 4. The triumphs of Christ at his ascension
declare his power in his acquisition; with a strong hand he broke the
chain of sinners, and 'led captivity captive' before he gave gifts to
men, Ps. lxviii. 18. He does the like in giving grace to the heart; he
rides upon his white horse in the power of almighty grace, when he
conquers the enmity in the soul, as well as when he overcomes the
enemies of his church, Rev. vi. 2.

(2.) It is a power as great as that which wrought in the resurrection of
Christ. It is considerable how loftily the apostle sets it out: Eph. i.
19, 20, 'And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who
believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought
in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right
hand in heavenly places.' Exceeding greatness of his power,
"huperthallon", with an hyperbole, according to the working or
efficaciousness of his mighty power, noting the infusion of faith in the
soul by a powerful impression, 'according to the working of the might or
strength.' One word was not enough to signify the great power working:
it is strength with a greater edge upon it; as when a man would fetch a
mighty blow, he stirs up all his strength, sets his teeth on edge to
summon all his spirits to assist his arm. The power of God in creation
of nature is never in the whole Scripture set forth so magnificently as
his power in the creation of grace is in this place. The apostle picks
not out any examples of God's power in his ordinary works, or that power
in lesser miracles which exceeded the power of nature, to illustrate
this power by. He does not say, It is that power whereby we work
miracles or speak with tongues: no; neither is it that power whereby our
Saviour wrought such miracles when he was in the world. It is a more
illustrious power than the giving sight to the blind, speech to the
dumb, hearing to the deaf, yea, or life to a putrefied carcass, this is
an extraordinary power. But yet this gracious power is higher than all
this, for it is as great as that which wrought the two greatest miracles
that ever were acted in the creation as great as the raising Jesus
Christ perfectly dead in the grave, and having the weight of the sin of
the world upon him, and as great as that power which, after the raising
of him, set him in his human nature at his right hand, above
principalities and powers, above the whole angelical state, as much as
to say, As great as all that power which wrought the whole scene of the
redemption, from the foundation-stone to the top-stone. It is such an
unconquerable power, whereby God brings about all his decrees which
terminated in Christ. Some say this power is not exercised in the
begetting faith, but in the faithful after faith is begun. It is very
strange that a less power is necessary to beget, than to preserve a
thing after it is brought into being. And the same power is requisite to
raise the heart of the most moral man under heaven out of the grave of
corrupted nature, as well as those that are furthest in their
dispositions from God. As, had not our Saviour had the weight of the
sins of men upon him, had he been dead but an hour or two, lain in the
grave with a little loose or light sand cast upon him, it would have
required infinite power to have restored him to life. The apostle
mentions this in other places, though not so highly as in this: Rom. vi.
4 'That like as Christ was raised up by the glory of the Father, even so
we should walk in newness of life.' It must be understood thus. Even so
we, being raised up by the glory of the Father, should walk in newness
of life. And it may be partly the meaning of the apostle Peter, 1 Peter
i. 3, 'Who has begotten us to a lively hope by, or through, the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,' not only as the foundation
of our hopes, but by a power conformable to that which raised Christ
from the dead. I would only by the way note, that this infers a higher
operation than merely an exhortation and suasion; for would any man say
of a philosopher that had taught him morality, that he had displayed in
him the exceeding greatness of his power, only upon the account of
advising and counselling him to reform his manners, and live more
soberly and honestly in the world? Our Saviour esteemed this one thing
greater than all the other miracles he wrought, and declared himself to
be the Christ more by this than by any other. When John sent to know who
he was. he returns no other account than the list of his miracles: 'The
blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached,' Luke vii. 20. That
which brings up the rear as the greatest is, 'the poor
"euangelidzontai", are evangelised;' it is not to be taken actively of
the preaching of the gospel, but passively, that they were wrought upon
by the gospel, and became gospelled people, transformed into the mould
of it, else it would bear no analogy to the other miracles; the deaf
hear, and the dead were raised; they had not exhortations to hear and
live, but the effects were wrought in them; so those words import not
only the preaching of the gospel to them, but the powerful operation of
the gospel in them. This greatest miracle in the catalogue is the only
miracle our Saviour has left in the world since the cessation of all the
rest.

I have insisted the longer upon these perfections in God apparent in
this work.

1\. To stir up every renewed person to a thankful frame towards God,
that he should engage his choicest attributes for the good of a poor
creature. To what purpose did the apostle so long and so highly speak of
the power of God in raising them from a spiritual death, but that they
should acknowledge it, and admire God for it? It cannot but raise high
admirations and adorations of God, to consider how mercy moved for them,
sovereignty called them out, wisdom modelled them, holiness cleansed
them, and power framed them.

2\. To stir up deep humility. It is a plain declaration of our miserable
estate by nature, and the difficulty of emerging out of it, impossible
for any creature to effect. Had not God been infinitely merciful, wise,
holy, true, and omnipotent, and put forth his power to free men from a
slavery to sin, not a man had been able to escape out of it; and these
two, admiration of God, and humiliation of self, are the two great acts
of a Christian, which set all other graces on work. Mercy speaks us very
miserable, wisdom declares us fools, holiness unclean, and power
extremely weak.

3\. How mightily will it give a ground to the exercise of faith! He that
is deeply sensible of this work of holiness and power in him, cannot but
trust God upon his deed, as well as before he did upon his word. As you
go to the promises without you, consider also the counterpart of the
promise within you, and the efficacy of that power which wrought it. You
have a ground of faith within you; the power extends to every one
wherein this work is wrought: 'What is the exceeding greatness of his
power to us-ward who believe;' this the apostle speaks to all the
believing Ephesians.

4\. Therefore look much into yourselves by way of examination, to
observe the actions of God's wisdom, holiness, and power within you. The
want of this makes many gracious persons live disconsolately. Paul was
certainly diligent in his observation, since he speaks so feelingly and
experimentally of it. It is the way to answer Satan's objections,
silence unbelieving thoughts, when you can trace the steps and
operations of them in you; it would make you strive for an increase of
this work of regeneration, that you may feel in yourselves more
evidences of the holiness and power of God.

5\. Those that want it may well despair of attaining it by themselves
and their own strength. Divine wisdom and power are exerted in this
work, and men may as well think themselves able to raise a dead man,
yea, Christ from the grave, and set him at the right hand of God, as do
this by their own strength. If we want an eye or a hand, all the
creation cannot furnish us with either. How can any power but that which
is infinite give us an eye to look to Christ within the veil, and a hand
to clasp him in heaven?

6\. It directs men where to seek it, and to seek it earnestly. At the
hands of God, since infinite wisdom, holiness, and power, are necessary
for the production of it. With earnestness, because it is so
transcendent a work, has so many perfections of God shining in it, that
creature-strength and wisdom is utterly unable to frame and raise it;
and with hopes too, if they earnestly seek it, since God has hereby
declared himself infinitely loving, in the combination of so many
attributes for the effecting of it. Plead, therefore, the glory of God
in these his attributes, and if God give you a heart to seek it, it is a
probable argument he will give you that grace which he has given you a
heart to desire.

IV\. Quest. How God does this?

1\. This work is secret, and therefore difficult to be described. The
effects are as obvious to a spiritual sense, as the methods of it
obscure to our understandings; secret as the original of winds, sensible
as the sound and bluster of them, John iii. 8. If a dead man were
raised, he would not know the manner how his soul returned into the
body, how it took its former place, and made up a new union, yet he
would know that he lives and moves. A gracious soul knows that he was
carnal, and now spiritual, blind, and that he now sees. He finds
strength instead of weakness, inclinations to good instead of
opposition, sweetness in the ways of God instead of bitterness. The
methods of grace are obscure as those of nature: Eccles. xi. 5, 'Who
knows the way of the spirit, or how the bones grow in the womb of her
that is with child? even so thou knows not the works of God who makes
all.' The manner of the formation of Christ in the soul is as
undiscernible as the formation of a child, or the manner of Christ's
conception in the womb of the virgin, both which are fearful and
wonderful, as it is said of the first, Ps. cxxxix. 14, 'Who can declare
his generation 9' Isa. liii. 8; that is, the generation of Christ,
either in his person or in his people. We cannot give a satisfactory
account of the natural motions of our souls, how one faculty commands
another, how the soul governs the several parts of the body, what the
nature of the action of our mind is in contemplation and reflection, how
our wills move the spirits in the body, whereby the members are acted in
their motion, and the functions of life performed. Much more
undiscernible are the supernatural methods of the Spirit of God. We know
ourselves heirs to the corruption of the first Adam by the inbeing of
it, the light of the grace of the second Adam discovers itself in the
soul, but the manner of the descent of either is not easily to he
determined. The loadstone's attracting of iron is the best
representation of this work; the soul, like that, moves sensibly,
cleaves strongly to God; but wherein this virtue consists, how
communicated, both in that of nature and this of spirit, dazzles the eye
of reason.

2\. Yet this is evident, that it is rational; that is, congruous to the
essential nature of man. God does not deal with us as beasts, or as
creatures destitute of sense, but as creatures of an intelligent order.
Who is there that believes in Christ in such a manner as heavy things
fall to the earth, or light things fly up to the air, or as beasts run
at the beck of their sensual appetite, without rule or reason? If the
Spirit of God wrought so upon man, this were to lay our faculties
asleep, not to act them, but to act only upon them; this were to invert
the natural order by creation, to raze out the foundations of virtue,
and deny the creature the pleasure of his condition, who, according to
such a manner of operation, could not understand his own state, no more
than a brute can the harmony of music, or the pleasing variety of
colours. But grace perfects our souls, possesses them with new
principles, moves one faculty by another, like the motions of the wheels
in a clock or watch; like the common course of providence, wherein he
orders all affairs according to the dependence of them one upon another
by creation, without making any inroad upon the natural rights of any
creature, but preserving them entire, unless in some miraculous action.
He diffuses a supernatural virtue into the soul, not to thwart it in
that course of working he appointed it in the creation, but to move it
agreeably to its nature as a rational being. As the sun conveys a
celestial virtue upon the plants, drawing them forth by its influence
according to their several natures, so the Holy Ghost introduces a
supernatural principle into men, whereby they act as reasonable
creatures in a higher strain. What methods our Saviour used in the first
declaration of the gospel, he uses in the propagation of it in the
hearts of men. The same reason that is used in writing the indenture is
used in writing the counterpart. He might, by his omniscient wisdom,
have found the way to the most secret corner of every man's heart, and
by his power have set up what standard he pleased in every part of the
castle, without proposing the gospel in the way of miracles and
arguments; but he transacts all that affair in such a manner, that men
might be moved in a rational way to their own happiness. He required a
rational belief, as he gave rational evidences: John x. 37, 'If I do not
the works of my Father, believe me not;' that is, the works that none
but one empowered by God could do. God, that requires of us a reasonable
service, would work upon us by a reasonable operation. God therefore
works by way of a spiritual illumination of the understanding, in
propounding the creature's happiness by arguments and reasons, and in a
way of a spiritual impression upon the will, moving it sweetly to the
embracing that happiness, and the means to it which he does propose; and
indeed without this work preceding, the motion of the will could never
be regular.

God does this by a double work.

1\. Upon the understanding.

2\. Upon the will.

1\. Upon the understanding. The opening the eyes precedes the conversion
from darkness to light, in God's operation as well as in the apostles'
commission, Acts xxvi. 18. The first appearance of life, when God raises
the soul, is in the clearness and distinctness of its knowledge of God,
Hos. vi 2, 3. And the apostle, in his exhortation to the Romans, tells
them the way for the transformation of their souls was by the renewing
of their minds: 'Be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds,' Rom.
xii. '2. The light of the sun is seen breaking out at the dawning at the
day, before the heat of the sun be felt. As the action of our sense is
to sensible objects, so is that of our soul to spiritual. Our eye first
sees an object before our hearts desire it, or our members move to it;
so there is an apprehension of the goodness of the thing proposed,
before there be any motion of our wills to it; so God begins his work in
our minds, and terminates it in our wills. In regard of this, as a state
of nature is set forth under the term of darkness, so a state of grace
is often termed light, that being the first work in the new creation, as
it was the first word of command in the old, 'Let there be light,' 2
Cor. iv. 6, Col. iii. 10, and is therefore called a renewing 'in
knowledge,' or unto knowledge or acknowledgement, "anakainoumenon eis
epignosin". If you consider the Scripture, you will find most of the
terms whereby this is set forth to us have relation to the
understanding. The gospel itself is called knowledge, Luke i. 77,
wisdom, 1 Cor. i. 30. What faculty in man is appointed for the
apprehending of a science to gain wisdom, but the understanding? That
whereby we receive the gospel is called 'the spirit of the mind,' 'the
eyes of the understanding' and 'sight,' which is put before believing:
John vi. 40, 'Every one which sees the Son, and believes on him.' The
work of grace is called 'revelation,' Gal. i. 16, 'illumination,' Eph.
i. 18, 'translation from darkness to light,' 'opening the heart.' The
action of our minds being enlightened, is called 'comprehending', Eph.
iii. 18, and 'knowledge,' 2 Peter i. 2. All respect the understanding as
the original wheel which God primarily sets in order, from whence he
does influence secondarily all the other faculties which depend upon its
guidance, God preserving hereby the order which he instituted in nature.
Therefore, when the understanding savingly apprehends the deformity of
sin, the will must needs hate it; when it apprehends the mercy of God,
and the beauty of holiness, the will must needs love him, and the higher
the degrees of this saving illumination are in the mind, the stronger
and firmer are the habits and acts of grace in the will. This
illuminative act of the Spirit is before, *prior natura*, the other of
inclining the will, for the understanding is first exercised about the
word, as *verum*, true, before the will is concerned in it as good. The
understanding takes in the light of the gospel, which, by the working of
the Spirit, is reflected upon the will, whereby it is changed into the
image of Christ, whose gospel it is: 2 Cor. iii. 18, 'Beholding as in a
glass the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image.' The
first act is of the mind, which is the eye of the soul; where the
apostle intimates, that the whole progress, as well as the first change,
is wrought in this manner.

This is wrought,

1\. By removing the indisposition and prejudices which naturally are in
the mind. As a wise physician which orders his medicines for the
removing of the principal humour. Chains of darkness must be broken,
films upon the eye must be removed, which hinder the act of vision; for
what the eye is to the body, that the understanding is to the soul. The
darkness of ignorance is promised in the covenant to be scattered: 'They
shall all know me, from the least to the greatest of them,' Jer. xxxi.
34. This being a law in the inward parts, the eye must be cleared to
read it, as well as the heart cleansed to obey it. The object being
spiritual, requires a spiritual disposition in the faculty for the
reception of it. This is called in Scripture a giving eyes to see, and
ears to hear, Deut. xxix. 4, and the revealing things not only by the
word, but by the Spirit, 1 Cor. ii. 10, which, in regard of rectifying
the reasons and judgments of men, is called a 'spirit of judgment,' Isa
iv. 4, 'and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst
thereof; by the spirit of judgment. and the spirit of burning:' a spirit
of judgment, as it is light in the understanding, removing the darkness,
a spirit of burning, as it is heat in the heart, thawing the hardness.
It reduces the mind into a right order, and teaches it to judge between
truth and falsehood, between good and evil, the want of which is the
cause of sin; whence sins are called "agnoemata", Heb. ix. 7, errors, as
arising from error in judgment. Since the mind is hued with fogs, and
incapable to perceive the splendour of divine truths, God acts upon the
mind by an inward virtue, causing the word proposed to be mixed with an
act of faith, which he begets in the soul, whereby it apprehends the
excellency of that state presented to it in the gospel. As there is a
manifestation of his name in the word, so there is an operation of his
grace, an internal teaching by God, as well as an external by the
gospel; the proposal of the word by man, the opening and fitting the
heart by God: John vi. 45, 'Every man that has heard, and has learned of
the Father, comes unto me'. Christ taught all by his ministry, the
Father only some by his Spirit. Learning of God goes before coming to
Christ, and those two acts are plainly distinguished: Isa. vi. 9, 10,
'Hear and not understand.' The lock of their minds was to be opened, as
well as that of their ears; the prophet's voice could unlock the one,
the Spirit only had the key of the other. Men may enlighten as moral
causes, God only as the efficient cause, to root out the inward
indisposition. The Sprit also removes the prejudices against Christ as
undesirable, against holiness as troublesome, takes down the strength of
corrupt reasonings, pulls down those idols in the mind and false notions
of happiness, out-reasons men out of their inward thoughts of a
happiness in sensual pleasures, pride of life, mammon of honour or
wealth, which are the root of our spiritual disease, and first to be
cured. In this there is a manifest difference between the working of
Satan and the operation of God; he sets his battery against the
affections, because the entry is there easiest; God breaks in upon the
understanding, which, being the chief fort, will quickly be a means to
reduce the lesser citadels. And when the work begins in removing the
blindness, it is the way to a true conversion; when it begins only in
the affections, it is a prognostic of a quick starting aside. In an
outward exhortation, God acts suitably to our nature, since we are
endued with understanding and will; but in acting upon us within, he
does remedy the vice of our nature. since our reason and will are
corrupted.

(2.) It is wrought by bringing the mind and the object close together.
Sight is produced in a blind man by drawing off the scales from his
eyes, and the recourse of spirits to the eye necessary for sight;
besides this, there must be outward light, and objects coloured by that
light; and from the eye so disposed within, and the thing discovered
without, arises the action of sight. So from the preparation of the
understanding, and the application of the object, arises this action of
spiritual vision. There is a double opening, one of the gospel, the
other of the understanding; our Saviour did both, he 'opened the
Scriptures,' Luke xxiv. 32, and 'opened their understandings,' ver. 45,
that there might be a mutual entrance, that the word might dwell in
their hearts, and their hearts have admission into the I ord. The Spirit
shows the great things of the gospel to the soul: John xi. 14,
"anangelei", 'He shall receive of mine, and show it unto you,' not in
general, but bring them near to them, to make them view 'and know the
things that are freely given to them of God,' l Cor. ii. 12, the
benefits of the death and resurrection of Christ. He repeats them again
and again, that there may be an evidence in the mind that they are the
royal gifts of God. There is a knowledge, before this work of the
Spirit, but as of things at a distance. Many know the things proposed in
the gospel, but they know it not as a glorious gospel, nor see the
wonders in this law, till the Spirit brings that and the faculty close
together. As a man may discern a statue or picture at a distance, but
till the eye and the objects meet close together, it cannot discern the
beautiful workmanship upon them with any affection to them. Not that a
man knew nothing, or knows new reasons of those things which he knew
before; but there is a nearer, and therefore clearer, representation of
them, which is *demonstratio ostensiva*, whereby he knows them in
another manner than he did before. As a man may know the promises
before, but they were not brought so near to him as to taste them; taste
being an addition to knowledge, whereby a man knows that sensibly which
before he only knew notionally. It is one thing to know a mechanical
instrument, and another to know it in the operation of it, when it is
applied to its proper use. It is like a man that has his understanding
more cleared by seeing mathematical demonstrations, and lines drawn,
than by all the rules of art in his head.

(3.) By fixing the mind upon the subject so closely presented. The
Spirit settles that light and the object so in the mind, that it can no
more blow it out than puff out the sparklings of a diamond, or than an
artist endued with the habit of some art can divest himself of his
skill. Many men have some convictions of truth, but flashy and
uncertain, and which slip from their minds. But when the Spirit opens
the heart, it holds the object to the mind, and the mind to the object,
starts one holy thought after another about the truth it has darted in,
makes the mind peer about it, and take notice of every lineament of that
truth that we eye, and those thoughts lie down, rise up, and walk with
us. When Lydia's heart was opened, she 'attended to the things spoken by
Paul,' Acts xvi. 14, her whole heart cleaved to them. In this respect
the Spirit is a remembrancer, making the soul ponder and and over again
with all intenseness of mind the goodness and truth of those things in
the gospel which are brought unto it, that the heart is, as Paul was,
'bound in spirit to Jerusalem,' Acts xx. 22. The thoughts of that
journey did so haunt him and follow him, as the shadow does the body,
that no arguments of friends, nor fear of danger, could divert him; the
soul is bound by them, one consideration overtaking another, and all at
work beating upon the mind. Hence consideration is put before
conversion: Ezek. xviii. 28, 'Because he considers and turns away from
all his transgressions.' And it is called the 'engrafted word,' fastened
to the soul as a graft to the stock; when the heart is opened by the
Spirit, the word is inserted in and bound to it, and at last the heart
becomes one with the word, and grows up with it.

(4.) By bringing the soul to an actual reasoning and discourse upon the
sight of the evidence. God convinces the judgment with reasons proper to
evidence the truth and goodness of what he does propose, and that with
pregnant and prevailing demonstrations, which give a competent
satisfaction; therefore called the 'demonstration of the Spirit and
power,' 1 Cor. ii. 4, that is, a spiritual and powerful demonstration.
When the eye is opened, and the revelation made, and held close and fast
to the soul with a divine demonstration, that this is the only means to
elevate him to a high condition, and at last bring him to a blessed
immortality, the understanding is moved to compare the force of those
arguments, and consequently judges that true which before it counted
false and foolishness, and comes by the help of this spiritual light to
reason spiritually, and spiritually to discern the proposition made to
it. It compares its natural state with the happy state offered to it,
its own ignorance with that light, its own misery with that mercy. God
will not have man, that is so far above a beast, do anything without
reason; for this would be to do it brutishly, though the thing done were
never so good, When men act as men, they follow the judgment of the best
reason they can. And shall man, that was created a rational creature, be
renewed without reason, when the very work is to advance him to the true
state of a reasonable creature, and his reason is enlightened by the
Spirit, that it may rightly judge of the demonstrative arguments it
offers to him? Is there not as much reason for the guidance of the will
in the highest concern, as for the conduct of it in affairs of a lower
sphere? Man was first endued with reason, that he might rationally serve
God; and his depraved reason is reformed, that he may rationally return
to God. If, therefore, he act like a man in other things, he does not
surely act like a brute in this; but the Spirit excites that reason he
has enlightened to judge of those excellent things he does propose, and
the strength of the arguments he backs them with, which are so clear and
undeniable that they cannot be refused by a mind divested of those
indispositions which drew out before a contempt of them. The change in
the will being an election and choice, cannot be made without convincing
and satisfying reasons which induce it to that choice, and justify the
election it has made. That can hardly be called faith, when a man
believes that which he does not think upon the highest reason was his
duty to believe. And indeed what man is there that cannot allege some
reason why he is induced to this or that act? God moves men by
presenting things to the understanding under the notion of good, honest,
profitable; and when the understanding is enlightened to judge of things
in some measure under the same notion that God proposes them, a man's
own reason cannot but upon a view of them assent unto them, and that
assent is followed with a change, according to the degrees of that
illumination, if it be a saving one. Upon this account that our own
reason is excited to judge of the proposal, our faith can no more be
said to be a human faith, or the work to proceed from our own power,
than it can be said to be sensitive because it comes by hearing; for
though faith depends upon hearing and reasoning, as upon natural powers,
yet the light whereby the faculties are acted is wholly supernatural,
and from the Spirit of God.

(5.) Hence follows a full conviction of the soul. Both the knowledge of
its own misery, and the amiableness of the gospel offer, whence issues a
weariness under the one and desires for the other. By this enlightening,
the soul sees sin in its empire, God in his wrath, Satan in his tyranny,
and the hardness of the stone within him; he sees the law accusing, sin
triumphing, heaven shut and hell open, God ready to judge him, and his
soul every way deplorable. He sees also in the gospel how Christ has
expiated sin, answered the demands of the law, stills the clamours of
conscience, satisfied the justice of God by bearing his wrath; hereupon
the soul closes with Christ, and is born again. Here are heaps of sin
that cannot be numbered, on the other side are riches of mercy that
cannot be reckoned, there is sin to damn, here is a Christ to save;
heaven and hell, sin and Christ, damnation and salvation, are presented
in their proper colours, and pressed upon the understanding; which
beholds all by a clear light. And thus, by the illuminative virtue of
the Spirit, the soul is laid at God's foot in a sense of its misery, and
then drawn into Christ's arms by a sense of his grace. This is wrought
by a connective persuasion, for so the word "elegchein" signifies, John
xvi. 8, which causes both a sight of sin and a sense of righteousness,
and produces a full assent in the understanding.

2\. The next faculty wrought upon is the will. The will is inclined, as
well as the understanding enlightened, whereby spiritual things are
approved with a spiritual affection, the same hand that darts light into
the mind, puts heat into the will. After the act of understanding has
preceded in a serious consideration, and thorough conviction, the act of
the will, by virtue of the same Spirit, follows in a delightful motion
to the object proposed to it; it is conducted by light, and spirited by
love; the understanding hands the object to the will, as necessary to be
embraced, and the arms of the will are opened to receive it, as the eyes
of the mind are to behold it.

For the understanding of this, take these propositions.

Prop. 1. There seems to me to be an immediate supernatural work upon the
will, as well as upon the understanding: not that the understanding is
only enlightened, and the will follows the dictate of that without any
further touch of the Spirit upon it; but the will, as it is the will,
and therefore cannot be forced, there is need of a moral cause which may
determine it according to its nature, and draw it by the cords of a man.
When a master instructs a youth in his trade, he does it by arguments
morally; when he holds his hand with the instrument in it, and directs
the motion, he acts physically; so does the Spirit exhort us to
spiritual motion, telling us inwardly which is the way, that we may walk
in it, and take our wills by the hand, as it were, and lead them in the
way they are to go. A nurse's tongue and exhortation is not enough to
make a child to go, because of the weakness of its limbs; nor the light
in the understanding sufficient to move the will, wherein there is an
habitual weakness and contradiction. How did God work up the wills of
the Egyptians to lend their jewels to the Israelites, but by some
immediate touch. Their reason might have furnished them with many more
arguments against it than it could for it. They knew the Israelites had
been highly injured, and that very lately, too; that they could not but
have a deep sense of their oppression, and intentions of revenge, as far
as their power extended. They knew that the Israelites prepared for
flight, and might more than conjecture that they intended never to
return or send their jewels to them; for what need had they of so many
goods barely to sacrifice in the wilderness? How were their wills thus
banded against so many arguments against this action, and without any
strong reasons to move them to consent to such a desire of the
Israelites? How must this be but by the efficacious power of God, not
forcing their wills, but taming their fierceness, softening them by a
secret instinct, and exciting them to a grant of the Israelites'
request? The apostle says, God 'gives to will.' If there were not a
particular act upon the will, it had better been said, God gives to
understand and know, and man to will and do. After the evidence set up
in the understanding, there is a secret touch upon the will, opening and
enlarging it to run the way that is proposed in an excellent and
charming manner. As the poser of God raises every part of Christ, so the
same power raises every faculty of the soul; it was also a physical
power, since mere exhortation would never have effected it.

(1.) The Scripture intimates this in the terms whereby it signifies this
work to us, as creation, resurrection, regeneration, new birth, all
which denote some physical operation distinct in each faculty in the new
creation, as there was in the first; not only the law in the mind to
direct, but the heart of flesh to comply, is God's act. The fleshy heart
is wrought by him, as well as the knowledge of the mind lighted by him.
In generation something is removed, another thing introduced; in
regeneration then of the will, there is consonant to that an eradication
of corrupt habits, and an implantation of gracious ones. It is called a
'giving a heart,' a 'circumcision of the heart to love God,' Deut. xxx.
6. Love is an act of the will, though it supposes a knowledge of the
amiable oldest in the understanding. If faith be principally in the
will, as I think it is, as to consent; and the words *leaning, resting,
coming* rather note an act of the will than an act of the understanding;
there is then an operation of God upon the subject, viz. the will, in
the implanting of it.

(2.) The will is corrupted as well as the understanding. The works of
the flesh issue from both; if the corruption were only in the
understanding, then that being removed, the will would be regenerated.
As in a watch, if the fault be only in one wheel, that being mended, the
whole frame is rectified; but if there be a flaw in all, the mending of
one, though the principal one, which moves the rest, will not set every
wheel right, without a particular application of art to restore them to
their due frame. Was not original righteousness subjectively in the will
as well as in the mind? Did not a stoutness in the will succeed in the
place of that righteousness, as well as darkness in the place of light?
Must not there then be a habit of mollifying grace bestowed upon the one
as well as a habit of enlightening truth set up in the other; an
inclination to good in the will, and an aversion from evil, as well as
the knowledge of both? The corrupt proneness in the will is the cause
that it is easily excited to evil by the persuasion of the devil and the
world; and is there not need of an inward rectitude in the will to bias
it to a free embracing and close adherence to the good proposed to it by
God, that his grace may be efficacious in every part? This work is a
quickening a man under a universal spiritual death; the will was dead,
as well as the mind dark, which must have life instead of its deadness,
as the other has light instead of its darkness; and if they be two
distinct faculties, then there are two distinct acts of the Spirit,
though they depend one upon another. There is no less power requisite to
make us spiritually willing than to make us spiritually knowing, since
the corrupt habits in our wills are rather stronger than the prejudices
in our understandings; therefore there seems to be a distinct act in
removing the resistance from the one as well as expelling the darkness
from the other. As the Spirit takes away the wisdom that was sensual,
earthly, and devilish, so it divests the will of that disposition
whereby it was enamoured on that devilish wisdom of the flesh, and makes
it willing to cut off the right hand and right eye, to deny sin, which
is the very self, and engage in an irreconcilable quarrel against all
that which engrossed its choicest affections..

(3.) If the understanding has such a power, by virtue of its
illumination, without an act also of the Spirit upon the will, and a
particular application of the understanding to the will, and the will to
the understanding, why did not Adam's will follow his understanding? His
understanding was clear, without darkness; his affections first made the
rebellion; sense was the leader, and the will the follower. Eve's
understanding was not silent under the temptation of Satan, her
knowledge was actuated in that speech, 'God has said, You shall not eat
of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die,' Gen. iii. 3. She cites
the word, her understanding must needs concur with it, unless it were
corrupted and darkened before the fall. Where lay the resistance? In the
affections, and the will which sided with them. Why may not the will,
possessed with those evil habits, resist the understanding imperfectly
restored to its primitive light, as well as Adam's will did where there
was no scale or film upon the eye of his soul? And likely his affections
had kept their due order, if the will had preserved its due dependence
upon reason, and its sovereignty over the sensitive part. Do we not find
that our wills are oftener in contradiction to the true sentiments of
our understanding, and in conjunction with the affections, than in a due
subordination to the one and commanding over the other? Is it not
frequently seen that men of much light, knowledge, and gifts of reason,
answer not the end of that illumination, and are without a will to turn
to God? Besides, since corruption came in by the way of the affections,
when the understanding was clear, how can regeneration of the will come
in by the illumination of the understanding, without a particular
operation upon the will and affections? If it be said, the will follows
the dictate of the understanding, why did it not so in Adam? If we were
perfectly restored, as Adam was in innocence, without the grace of God
in our wills, as well as light in our understandings, we were not like
to keep up in due order.

(4.) God in his other creatures gives not only a light and fancy in
nature, but endues them with such principles that incline them to their
motion, as connatural to them. Why then, shall we not think, since the
will is an habitual power, that when the will is moved to supernatural
ends, it is endued with such a supernatural habit, whereby it may be
sweetly and readily moved to the chief good as its proper object? Are
there not corrupt habits in the will, which the Scripture calls 'lusts,'
and 'the works of the flesh,' Gal. v. 19-21, which the Spirit mortifies
as well as those of the mind? Why not, then, gracious habits set up in
the room of the other in this faculty as well as in the other?

(5.) If there were not a physical operation and habits in the will, what
would become of infants, who cannot in that state be renewed without
such a kind of working? They are not capable of moral exhortation, we
cannot conceive any other way the Spirit has to work upon them, but by
such a physical operation, putting habits into their wills, whereby they
are renewed and sanctified; they are capable of the habit, though not of
the act. We never find our Saviour spending any exhortations upon
infants, but he took them in his arms and blessed them, and told us that
of such is the kingdom of heaven; and if the kingdom of heaven be of
such, there is some operation upon them different from this method of
working only upon their understanding.

(6.) If there were not some operation of the Spirit upon our wills,
regeneration and conversion would be more our work than God's. If the
Spirit terminates his working only upon the understanding, and the will
be moved by the understanding alone, without any conjunction of the
Spirit in the work upon the will, then the Spirit does not immediately
concur to the chiefest part of regeneration, but as it illuminates the
mind; for the chief part of renewing grace is in the will; so it would
be more our work than God's, if the moral only were his, and the
physical operation only ours. It was in a less affair than this, wherein
David blessed God for the people's willingness, offering so freely,
acknowledging it indeed the people's act, but by God's overruling their
wills, 1 Chron. xxix. 13, 14.

(7.) God is all in all in glory: 1 Cor. xv. 28, 'When Christ shall have
delivered the kingdom to his Father, God then shall be all in all,' all
in their understandings, all in their wills; he shall be the immediate
cause of all things, and govern and dispose all things by himself, and
for himself; binding the souls of all the glorified by everlasting
ligatures to himself; all in all to the glorified, all light in their
understanding, all love and delight in their will, objectively,
efficiently. What efficacy he has in glory, shall we deny him in grace
in every particular faculty?

Prop. 2. Yet this work, though immediate, is not compulsive and by
force. It is a contradiction for the will to be moved unwillingly, any
force upon it destroys the nature of it; if it be forced, it ceases to
be will. It is not forced, because it is according to reason, and the
natural motion of the creature; the understanding proposing, and the
will moved to an embracing; the understanding going before with light,
the will following after with love. The liberty of the will consists in
following the guidance of reason; to have a liberty to go against it, is
the greatest misery of the creature. That is properly constraint, when
we are compelled to work contrary to the natural way of working; there
is no constraint by force, but there is a kind of a constraint by love,
because the Spirit accompanies this operation with so much efficacy,
that instead of that sadness we should have in a thing we were forced
unto, there is an unspeakable joy and contentment in the soul; it not
being possible to taste so much of the love of God, to be delivered from
so fearful a condemnation, to be brought to so glorious a hope, without
being seized upon with much pleasure and delight. God changes the
inclination of the will, but does not force it against its inclination;
the will, being a rational faculty, cannot be wrought upon but
rationally. Since the main work consists in faith and love, it is
impossible there can be any force; no man can be forced to believe
against his reason, or love against his will, or desire against his
inclination. Belief is wrought by persuasion; no man can be persuaded by
force. It cannot be conceived, that the will should will against the
will. No man can be happy against his will, all happiness consisting in
a suitableness of the object to the faculty; those things that in
themselves are the greatest pleasures of the world, if they please not a
man, cannot confer any happiness upon him. The Spirit never works thus,
because 'where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,' 2 Cor. iii.
17; he destroys not the liberty, but reduces it to will more nobly than
before. Besides, the liberty of the will does not stand in indifference
to this or that thing, for then the will would lose its liberty every
time it has determined itself to any one thing, because after the
determination it would be no longer indifferent to the other. But the
liberty of the will consists in being carried out according to the
dictate of the practical judgment, and not by a blind instinct. God does
not deal with us as stones and logs, or slaves, whom the whip makes to
do that which they hate in their hearts; but conducts us in ways
agreeable to our nature; he calls, saying, 'Seek you my face;' and
inclines the will to answer, 'Thy face, Lord, I will seek,' Ps. xxvoo.
8. That God who knows how to make a will with a principle of freedom,
knows how to work upon the will, without entrenching upon, or altering
the essential privilege he bestowed upon it; he that formed us, as a
potter does his vessel, knows very well the handles whereby he may take
hold of us, without making any breach in our nature.

Prop. 3. It is free and gentle. A constraint, not by force, but love,
which is not an extrinsic force, but intrinsic and pleasant to the will;
he bends the creature so, that at the very instant wherein the will is
savingly wrought upon, it delightfully consents to its own happiness; he
draws by the cords of a man, and by a secret touch upon the will makes
it willing to be drawn, and moves it upon its own hinges. It is sweet
and alluring; the Spirit of grace is called 'the oil of gladness;' it is
a delightful and ready motion which it causes in the will, it is a sweet
efficacy, and an efficacious sweetness. At what time God does savingly
work upon the will, to draw the soul from sin and the world to himself,
it does with the greatest willingness, freedom, and delight follow after
God, turn to him, close with him, and cleave to him, with all the heart,
and with purpose never to depart from him: Cant. i. 4, 'Draw me, and we
will run alter thee.' Drawing signifies the efficacious power of grace;
running signifies the delightful motion of grace; the will is drawn, as
if it would not come; it comes, as if it were not drawn. His grace is so
sweet and so strong, that he neither wrongs the liberty of his creature,
nor does prejudice his absolute power. As God moves necessary causes,
necessarily; contingent causes, contingently; so he moves free agents
freely, without offering violence to their natures. The Spirit glides
into the heart by the sweet illapses of grace, and victoriously allures
the soul: Hosea ii. 14, 'I will allure her, and speak to her heart;' not
by crossing, but changing the inclination, by the all-conquering and
alluring charms of love, as a man does that person whom he intends for
his spouse; for to that he alludes, because in the latter part of the
chapter, he speaks of the consummation of his marriage with the church:
ver. 16, 'In that day thou shalt call me Ishi.' In what day? In the day
that he should allure her, and speak to her heart. God puts on the
deportment of a lover in changing the frame of the will. The Spirit is
as one that leads the way into truth (the Spirit 'shall guide you,
"hodegesei", into all truth,' John xvi. 13); not drags; he opens the
heart, not by a forcible entry, but as a key that fits every ward in the
lock. The attraction of the will is much like that of iron by the
loadstone, which had no motion of itself till the powerful emissions of
the loadstone's virtue reached it, and then it seems to move with a kind
of voluntariness; there is no force used, but a delicious virtue emitted

which does, as it were, both persuade and enable it to join itself to
its beloved attracter. There is a secret virtue communicated by God,
which, as soon as it touches the soul, puts life and delightful motion
into it, which before lay like a log. It embraces Christ as its portion,
and passes a decree that it will keep his words: Ps. cxix. 67, 'Thou art
my portion, O Lord. I have said that I will keep thy words.'

Prop. 4. It is insuperably victorious. What the mouth of God speaks,
what his will purposes, his hand does fulfil, 1 Kings viii. 24. It is
not a faint and languishing impression, but a reviving, sprightly, and
victorious touch. As the demonstration of the Spirit is clear and
undeniable, so the power of the Spirit is sweet and irresistible; both
are joined, 1 Cor. ii. 4. An inexpressible sweetness allures the soul,
and an unconquerable power draws the soul; there are clear
demonstrations, charming persuasions, and invincible efficacy combined
together in the work. He leaves not the will in indifference. If God
were the author of faith only by putting the will into an indifference,
though it be determined by its own proper liberty, why may not he also
be said to be the author of unbelief, if by the same liberty of this
indifference it be determined to reject the gospel? For in the same
manner God is author of one motion of the will as well as of the other,
if he does no more than leave the will in an *aequilibrium*. This
irresistibleness takes not away the liberty of the will. Our Saviour's
obedience was free and voluntary, yet necessary and irresistible. He
could not sin in regard of the hypostatical union, yet he had a greater
aversion to sin than all the angels in heaven. Is not God freely and
voluntarily good, yet necessarily so? He cannot be otherwise than good,
he will not be otherwise than good. So the will is irresistibly drawn,
and yet does freely come to its own happiness. The soul is brought over
to God, and adheres to him, not by a necessity of compulsion, but of
immutability. As the angels necessarily obey God, not by compulsion, but
from an immutable love. A sinner is necessarily a servant to sin, a
regenerate man necessarily a servant to God; both by a kind of necessity
of nature. Our main business, then, is to see what new enlightenings
there are in our minds by the Spirit in the gospel, what tastes and
relishes we have of divine truths, how our wills are allured to a
sincere and close compliance with the proposals of God in the gospel,
what vigour is in them. This is God's method, to work first upon the
understanding, then upon the will. That work which begins first in the
affections, without light dawning and breaking in upon the mind, and
growing up by consideration and inquiries into the gospel is to be
suspected, and is not like to be durable.

This is the Scripture method, and every regenerate person may find it
more or less in himself.

V. The use is,

1\. For instruction.

(1.) If God alone be the author and efficient of the new birth, then it
does instruct us how insufficient a good education of itself is to
produce this work in the soul, and how unfit to be rested on, without a
further work. I doubt many may rest upon a religious education, without
searching and inquiring into themselves what further work of God has
been wrought upon them. God has entrusted parents with a power of
instructing their children, but reserves the power of renewing grace to
himself. If parents may set the object before them, God only can give
them a spiritual eye to discern it; if they may inform the
understanding, a divine touch only can bend the will; if they may lay
the wood of spiritual lessons together, yet the fire to kindle them in
the heart, and consume the lusts, must descend from heaven. Education
may correct, but not extirpate the malignity of nature; good
instruction, meeting with an orderly constitution, may sow the seeds of
moral virtue, and restrain natural corruption, but not weed that out of
our nature, or plant the root of grace, any more than the skilful
management of a beast can change its natural inclination, though it may
curb it. The folly bound up in the heart of a child is too strong for
the wisdom of man, and is wholly to be expelled by the wisdom which
comes down from heaven, set up in the heart by Christ, who is the wisdom
of the Father. The little stars of precepts glittering in the mind,
cannot make the young plants sprout up with their heads towards heaven,
without the influence of the sun. Christ, the Sun of righteousness,
fixed in the soul by the Spirit, can do more than all the stars of moral
instructions in the world. Timothy had as religious instruction from his
religious mother and grandmother as any in the world, both being
believers, 2 Tim. i. 5, yet Paul calls him his 'own son in the faith,' 1
Tim. i. 2, as having 'begotten him in the gospel.' Those instructions
did not beget him, though they might facilitate the evangelical work
which was wrought by the gospel in Paul's ministry. Therefore the
apostle manifestly distinguishes between instructors and fathers: 1 Cor.
in 15, 'Though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you
not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the
gospel.' He distinguishes their instructions from Christ, the efficient
cause, and himself through the gospel, the instrumental cause. Yet such
instruction is not to be neglected when children are capable; God may
set home that by the gospel, which has been sucked in in younger years.
Men may as well turn their backs upon the hearing the word, because it
is insufficient without the operation of the almighty grace. Instruction
and prayer should go hand in hand together; but take heed of resting
upon a good education.

(2.) It instructs us that regeneration does not depend merely upon the
word, if God alone be the efficient cause of it. It depends upon the
inward efficacy of the Spirit. Had it depended upon the power of the
apostles, or the outward demonstration of that word, they would have
converted all that they had preached to, they would not have suffered
any to have remained obstinate against the gospel: charity would have
obliged them to the exercise of their power; and their power would have
made their charity effectual. As God does seldom work without means, so
means can never work without God. David had the law of God in his hand,
but could not learn it without God's teaching; therefore he prays, Ps.
lxxxvi. 11, 'Teach me thy way, O Lord: I will walk in thy truth.' And in
many places of the 119th Psalm he takes notice, that all spiritual
knowledge comes from God, though in the way of his precepts: ver. 98
'Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies';
and ver. 104, 'Through thy precepts I get understanding.' While we use
the means, our eye should be upon God. Thomas had his fingers upon our
Saviour's wounds, but his thoughts upon Christ's divinity: 'My Lord, and
my God.' Food maintains the body, but by virtue of the soul animating
it, and enabling it to concoct that food. The Spirit of God is the soul
of the gospel, and of all means, to make them efficacious; and with this
power of the Spirit the weakest means can effect more than the greatest
means without it, which, indeed, can produce little or nothing. Peter's
sermon, Acts ii., was but short, but improved by the Spirit to the
conversion of three thousand souls. Means can do nothing of themselves
to change the heart. When the disciples had two ordinances representing
the death of Christ, i. e. the Passover and the Lord's supper, pride,
the great enemy to regeneration, put up its head above water; they
quarrelled 'who should be greatest,' Luke xxii. 24.

(3.) There is no reason to confide in our own purposes and resolutions,
or any strength of our own, if God alone be the efficient cause of
regeneration; for it depends not upon our resolves without the grace of
God. Satan fears not our vows; he knows, without grace they are but as
light feathers, easily to be puffed away by him; but sparks, which,
without his breath, the flood of corruption in our souls would
extinguish as soon as they begin to appear. How can our resolves without
grace renew us, when Peter's resolve, with his inherent grace, could not
defend him? who, after his boasting, when certainly he sincerely meant
what he said, fell so shamefully, that he stood in need of a new
conversion. How soon do we, after a transient awakening fall to nodding
in our spiritual sleep? If grace be not present with us to cure our
lethargy, our purposes are as empty sails hoisted by us, the breath of
the Spirit only fills with a full gale for motion. We can never
'steadfastly look into heaven, and see the glory of God,' unless we be
'full of the Holy Ghost,' Acts vii. 55. Stephen's eye would have been
twinkling, had not the divine Spirit fixed it. How soon will a slight
blast of a temptation shake a building, which has no other foundation
but the moveable sand of our own purposes, when as slight a temptation
shook the image of God out of Adam with all its brightness, who was
built with God's own hand, with a power also to keep himself! Adam could
not be without purposes of obedience when he heard the precept, yet with
a slender temptation came tumbling to the dust, and fell as low as hell.
A vain confidence in our own resolutions is so far from being a cause of
this spiritual birth, that it is rather a hindrance, and part of the
pride of nature, that must be demolished, and to be reckoned as one of
the eldest things among these old things that are to pass away. Trust
not, therefore, to yourselves; look up daily for the divine influence;
lean not to your own understanding, though in part enlightened; confide
not in your own wills, though in part inclined to the best things,
pursue nothing in your own strength.

(4.) It is an injury to God to associate any thing with him in this
work, which he challenges as his own production. Would it not be a
disparagement to deny him the sole efficiency in one of the noblest
works of his wisdom and holiness? That he who wrought the comely fabric
of the first creation by his power and wisdom, without a co-partner, or
deputing any of the highest angels to bring the world into form, should
not have the honour of a work which bears the stamp of a higher wisdom
and power than the whole creation! That he who contrived the models of
the little creatures in the world, should leave this to the foolish
contrivance of any creature! Why should we imagine that the divine
image, upon whom the highest blessedness of the creature depends, should
be of so little value in the judgment of God's infinite wisdom, as to be
turned over from the care of so wise a workman, to the capriciousness of
a light and uncertain will, more blind and mutable than Fortune the
heathen goddess? It is more (we have heard) to frame so excellent a
piece as the new creature is, out of the rubbish of sin, than to frame
the whole celestial and elementary world out of a rude mass of matter;
since there is a greater gulf to be shot between corruption and grace
than between nothing and the beautiful structure of heaven and earth;
and, therefore, we may less disparage him, in denying him the title of
creator of the world, than that of the creator of a new heart, since he
has promised by his own mouth to do it with his own hand. The apostle
cannot be charged with ignorance, but knew what he said in that
comprehensive thanksgiving for 'all spiritual blessings in Christ;' if
all, then one of the highest, the new creation, is not intended to be
left out of the roll of spiritual blessings, associating none with God,
as the principal, but Christ as the Mediator, conveying this grace by
his Spirit, according to the orders of the Father: 'Blessed be the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all
spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ,' Eph. i. 3.

(5.) See from hence how excellent a thing it is to be born again, if God
be the sole efficient of it! Whatsoever God is the author of in his
ordinary works, is excellent in its kind, they are all the effects of
his will; this is an effect of his gracious will. Other generations are
by the will of man, wherein the will of God concurs with them; this is
solely by the will of God, without any concurrence of the will of man in
the first work, called therefore by way of excellency, 'the faith of the
operation of God,' Col. ii. 12, not a gift conveyed by angels, but his
Spirit. A grain of grace of God's planting is more worth than millions
of gold of man's getting; a more worthy gift than all the gold of Ophir,
which God gives to men by their industry, who shall never see his face;
but this by his own Spirit in order to glory. It is a royal gift he
reserves in his own hands, to bestow upon those that were his favourites
in his eternal purposes; it grows not in every man's ground, neither is
it sown in every man's field. The soul is more excellent than the body,
not only in respect of its nature, but in respect of its immediate
author. God is called particularly, 'The Father of spirits,' not of
bodies, though he is so; but in the production of bodies he acts by the
hand of nature, in the production of the soul by his own hand. In that
work he acts by the intervention of second causes; in this, without.
serving himself of any other efficient cause but his own will. If the
soul, as being the only work of God, is therefore more excellent, then
certainly a new-born soul is more excellent than anything in the world,
in regard God is the author of it in a more peculiar manner, by the
operation of his choicest affections.

(6.) If God be the efficient of regeneration, then there is a necessity
of the influence of God in all the progress of grace. It is yet
imperfect, the same hand that planted it must also water and dress it.
There is a tough sinew left in man's will, which makes him halt after he
has the new name of Israel put upon him, a weakness of faith, a coldness
of love, a faintness of zeal. What he is the creator of, is nursed by
his providence; what he is the new creator of, is fostered by a
succession of grace. The scripture therefore appropriates all to him: he
is the God that calls us, the God that anoints us, the God that carries
us, the God that establishes us, the God that keeps us, and the God that
perfects us. He is the author of grace in its first issue, its fruitful
sproutings, its delicious ripenings, it depends upon him in creation,
preservation, augmentation, as well as natural things depend upon him in
all their progressive motions, from one degree to another, as the author
of nature. When nature was most unspotted, grace was necessary to
preserve and fix it in that state. Adam needed the assistance of grace
with the embellishments of nature. The same power that inspires us with
life, inspires us with a perpetual continuation of it. If the tide that
turns the stream of the river desert it, and return to its own channel,
the river will return to its natural current. Our hearts will decline,
our life languish, unless fed by that supernatural efficacy which did
first produce it. The plants cannot grow merely from their own internal
form, nor trees bring forth their pleasant fruits without the influence
of rain and sun, feeding and hatching their innate spirits, and drawing
them out to make a show of themselves in flowers and fruits; and when
they are brought forth, they stand in need of the same rain to fill
them, the same sun to ripen them.

(7.) If God be the efficient, &c., we see whither we are to have
recourse in all the exigencies of the new creature, to whom, but to the
author of those beginnings of eternal life! God is all, in all parts of
this glorious work: 'The God of all grace, who has called us into his
eternal glory, make you perfect, strengthen, establish, settle you,'
&c., 1 Peter v. 10. There is need of preserving, strengthening,
increasing, quickening, and perfecting grace.

These you need, and these must be sought, and will be had from the same
goodness and power by which you were new born.

\[1.\] Preserving grace.

First, God only can give it. There is a necessity of it; as God rears
it, so he only can keep it from pining away. Plants will wither if the
rain do not descend; the flame will be extinguished if fuel be not
added. There is as much a necessity of a constant influence to keep up
this new nature, as there is of the sun to preserve the horizon from
that darkness which would invade it upon the turning its face to other
parts of the world. The perpetual duration of renewing grace is not
essential to grace, for then Adam and the angels had stood by virtue of
their grace, for nothing ever loses its essential property; but it is by
an additional grace, distinct from the first grace wherein our
regeneration does consist, as the preservation of the creatures in their
natural beings is by an act of God, distinct from his creative act. The
first grace God gives now is a bounty to his creatures, but it is
further an obligation upon himself, not as it is grace, or as it is his
own work, for Adam's grace which failed was brought by his fingers,
inspired by his breath, but as it is a new covenant grace which alters
the condition of it. God's finger wrote the law in the heart, and his
breath can only blow the dust off, that would fill the engraved letters.

Secondly, God will preserve it. Job would argue with God, and ask him,
'Is it good unto thee that thou should despise the work of thine hands?'
Job x. 3. Is it agreeable to his goodness and wisdom to slight and
neglect the work of his own heart; not a fruit of his common liberality
to the creation, but a choice fruit of his redeeming love? His common
love, as he is the author of nature, preserves the old creation; much
more his special love, as he is the author of the new nature, will
preserve the new creation. His general goodness made the world, but his
gracious goodness formed the soul; the one is more splendid than the
other, therefore the effect more durable. Mercy compasses the godly
about. Ps. xxxii. 10, like bulwarks that surround a city for its
defence, against the assaults of spiritual enemies. A higher providence
attends man than other creatures, because he is of a more noble
constitution; upon the same account a higher providence must attend the
new creature, as being far more noble than mere man. God embraces all
creatures in his arms with a common love as creatures, he lays the new
begotten ones in his bosom by a special love. His power too is to be
considered. He will not want a power to preserve that which he did not
want power to new create. The power being the same that raised Christ
from the dead, which raised any from their natural condition, will have
the same issue, since it never suffered Christ to return to the grave
again, neither will it suffer any new born soul to return to a spiritual
death. Every new creature is the Father's by purpose, and by actual
traction; they were his before they were Christ's. The Father draws them
to Christ; and the power of Christ will be as eminent to preserve them,
as the power of the Father was to draw them. Why were the creatures
brought, by that instinct God put into them, into Noah's ark, but to be
preserved from the destroying deluge? Why did he take pains to write the
law anew in the heart, if be would suffer it to be dashed out again? If
he would not preserve his own work, why did he not let the soul lie
wallowing in its old filthiness, and forbear the expense of those fresh
colours he has new drawn his image with? It seems to be a greater power
to take off all that load of sin which lay upon you, than to preserve
you from having so great a burden again upon you. It is not reasonable
to think that God should be at so much cost, only to restore man to
Adam's mutable condition, whereby to incur a greater condemnation.

\[2.\] Strengthening grace. This we need, as well as preserving grace.
It is God that strengthens us in the inward man; by that strengthening
grace the new creature can do all things, without it nothing. Through
him we are more than conquerors over principalities and powers, Rom.
viii. 37, 38. Strength to mount up to heaven as an eagle, to run our
race without weariness, to walk without fainting, to combat difficulties
without sinking fears, is only to be had by waiting upon the Lord, who
is the fountain whence all these flow, Isa. xl. 31, and by his grace
confers a supernatural fortitude: Isa. xl. 31, 'But they that wait upon
the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
eagles they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not
faint.' Look not therefore for strength in your new nature; look for it
in God, in that Spirit which first renewed you, since that glorious
power is imparted to strengthen you. which was at first employed to
new-create you. This was the matter of the apostle's prayer for the
Colossians, and this should be ours: Col. i. 9, 11, 'Strengthened with
all might, according to his glorious power.' There is much weakness in
us, a medley of lusts, an army of enemies, but the way is open for us to
that glorious power, to endue us with a new vigour, which first seized
upon us with an insuperable efficacy, our shattered and weakened sins
shall not be able to resist that glorious power by which they could not
stand the shock of when they were in their full strength. 'God will be a
sun and a shield,' Ps. lxxxiv. 11, a sun to dispel our darkness, a
shield to secure us from darts; a sun against the allurements of the
world, defeating them by a charming light; a shield against the
allurements of the world, overpowering them by an irresistible force;
the sun that gave us life, the shield that secures our strength. The
glorious power which we need in our progress lies in the same arm which
wrought our deliverance, and from thence must be fetched. It is only by
him that we have strength to tread down the wicked one's temptations;
and those fiery darts are made as ashes under the soles of our feet,
Mal. iv. 8.

\[3.\] We need increasing grace; and that is from God. The increase
depends upon him, as well as the first planting. When we want it, he is
the fountain from whence we must draw it; so did the disciples, Luke
xvii. 5, 'Increase our faith,' or add to us faith, "prosthes hemin".
Every new spring, fresh bud, spreading blossom, is an addition by his
influence. When we have it, we must acknowledge his sole hand in it, so
the apostle did when he saw the growth of the Thessalonian faith, and
the abounding of their charity: 2 Thes. i. 3, 'We are bound to thank
(eucharistein ofeilomen) God always for you, because that your faith
grows exceedingly.' He did it by obligation: no such tie had lain upon
him had God left them to increase it themselves. The new fruits you bear
is from his new purging, as the first power to bear was from his
planting, John xv. 2. If you would thrive, it must not be by your own,
but by the increases of God; 'God gives the increase,' both in the
outward administration and inward operation of the gospel, 1 Cor. iii.
7. Faith, in every assent, is conducted by that power which first
settled it in the heart, and without it cannot commence any higher
degree. As every spark of spiritual life is by his kindling, so every
sparkling of that spark is by his blowing. Look for it at God's hands,
beg of him to write that law deeper, which his fingers first engraved in
your hearts. It is God's being 'a dew to Israel' makes him grow up in
beauty as 'the lily and the olive tree,' in strength 'cast out his roots
as the cedars of Lebanon,' Hosea xiv. 5-7. If you would grow up as
calves of the stall, you must lie under the healing wings of the Sun of
righteousness: Mal. iv. 2, 'Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of
righteousness arise with healing in his wings,' &c. That Sun which by
his beams conveyed into you a spiritual life, can only by the same heat
influence you to a taller growth. Every drop of the knowledge of his
will till you come to be filled, every mite of wisdom and spiritual
understanding, is to be drawn from him only, Col. i. 9, both the
additions of knowledge and the deeper impressions and lively sproutings
of what we know.

\[4.\] Quickening grace. This also we need. As our life, so the
liveliness and activity of grace depends upon the divine influence; a
divine motion is necessary to elevate our souls to those actions which
are supernatural; our grace depends upon God in *actu secundo*, as well
as *actu primo*. As God first puts a nature into creatures (in the
exercise as well as the being) and then quickens them by his
providential concurrence in those acts suitable to their nature, which
acts are therefore natural to those creatures, so by a gracious
concurrence he does quicken the new nature in the soul to the exerting
of gracious operations, according to that nature he has endued it with.
As he tunes the strings by his skill to fit them for a divine harmony,
so he enlivens them by his touch to make what music he pleases; every
heavenly prayer, every gracious groan, every start of spiritual
affection, is from the Spirit tuning, quickening, assisting against
infirmities and deadness. There must be a continued drawing to make a
continued running. 'Draw us, and we will run after thee,' Cant. i. 4. It
was the church, the gracious church, the spouse and dove of Christ, yet
sensible of her own inability to quicken her pace to new communion with
Christ, without fresh communications first from him. There is a bias in
the soul to direct it in a right motion; there must be a hand without to
put it upon that motion; Christ must 'put his hand in at the hole of the
door' before a lazy soul, though gracious, will stir at his call, Cant.
v. 3; or as a child, which has a principle of motion, must be assisted
and quickened by the nurse before it can move a step. Grace is more
prevalent to keep us from sin than excite us to holiness, yet neither
can be done by it without new quickenings; our motion is in him and by
him, as well as our life, spiritually as well as naturally Acts xvii.
28, 'In him we live, move, and have our being;' the old stock must have
continual supply. Without Christ we can do nothing, John xv. 5; without
him we cannot have grace in the plant, nor grace in the fruit. As the
soul excites the spirits in the eye to an act of vision,—if they be not
quickened by their governor, though things be before our eyes they see
nothing,—so the Spirit of God excites, as it were, the spirits of grace
to their particular acts, faith to apprehend and love to work. The
goodness that made the promise guides the hand of the soul to fasten
upon it: Ps. cxix. 49, 'Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which
thou hast caused me to hope.' As God makes the promises, so he makes the
meeting between the soul and the promise; every motion proceeds from
God's touch upon the heart enlarging it, therefore our dependence must
be upon God's grace: Ps. cxix. 32, 'I will run the way of thy
commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart.' I will run, not by my
own strength, but by the hand of God enlarging and enlivening my heart.
Indeed, if God did not give to act as well as implant the habit, he
would give no more to us in the new covenant than he gave to Adam in the
old, who had a power to do, but not the act of doing; his power was from
God, but the act of obedience depended upon himself, and for want of
actual obedience he fell. We see whence we must derive our quickenings;
we want them because we expect them from the new nature in us, not from
the author of that nature, and the concurrence of his grace with it, and
depending upon habitual more than actual grace is the cause of our
having many a slip. We are as dead lumps, notwithstanding all the grace
we have, if God did not cause a free life to spring up in us by
successive breathings.

\[5.\] Perfecting grace is only from God. He is the finisher of what he
is the author of, Heb. xii. 2, and in our spiritual warfare supplies us
with new recruits, till the combat end in victory, and the victory in
triumph. He will come 'as the former and the latter rain,' Hosea vi. 3:
as the former rain to open the womb of the earth, and the latter rain to
ripen the fruits of the earth. As he has laid the foundation of mount
Zion, so he will perform the whole work in it; he fulfils the work of
faith with the same power wherewith he begins it, 2 Thes. i. 11. The
power which caused the resurrection of Christ caused his ascension; he
had his forty days upon the earth, after his resurrection, before he was
taken up to glory. There is a continuance of a believer in the world
after his resurrection from a spiritual death, but the same power which
caused his spiritual resurrection will as surely cause his heavenly
ascension. That arm that brought him out of Egypt will conduct him to
the limits of Canaan, the flourishing pastures of the promised land.
Grace is the first gift, glory is the latter; glory follows upon the
heels of grace: 'He will give grace and glory,' Ps. lxxxiv. 11. Grace to
fit for glory, and glory to reward his own grace; all grace till it ends
in glory. God must be sought and depended on for this; we cannot will
our perfection without grace, as we cannot will our regeneration without
grace; God gives the will, the progressive as well as the initial will.
Then seek only to God, depend upon him only, for the warmth of his
goodness, to bring those chickens to perfection which he has gathered
under his wing; his affections are not tired, it is a pure disinterested
love mingled with no defects; his wisdom and power is no less able to
perfect than his love is to incite him to it.

Use 2. The second use is of comfort.

Is God the author of regeneration? He that is the God of all grace is
the God of all comfort too. Where he is the one, he will be the other.
As he creates the soul to good works, so he creates it to heavenly
consolations. When God acts as a God of justice toward sinners, he
appears as a terrible God in his punishments; when he acts towards
saints as a God of grace, he appears as a comforting God, he fills the
one with all terrors, prepares the other for all comforts; he calls you
by a new creation into his eternal glory, and sends therefore some
sparkles of glory into the soul here. Are you born of God? You approach
in excellency as near to Christ as a creature's capacity will admit.
Christ was his natural begotten son, believers his spiritually
regenerated children. Christ is 'the first born,' but 'among many
brethren,' Rom. viii. 29, that Christ 'that sanctifies, and we that are
sanctified, are all of one,' Heb. ii. 11, of one nature, say some, of
one Father, say others; therefore 'he is not ashamed to call them
brethren,' one nature does not so much make us brethren as one father.
Christ was not regenerated, but generated, he stood not in need of the
other, because the first generation failed not, neither could he, being
God, he is the exact image of his Father's person, and so particularly
of all his attributes, because he partakes of his essence. Believers are
the living images of God's holiness, not partaking of all his
attributes, but of that.

Particularly,

(1.) God will rejoice in his own work. If he rejoiced in the first
planting of his image at the creation, he will no less rejoice in it at
the restoration and with more gladness embrace the son that is returned
from death to life by returning from his debauched coarse, than that son
that remained with him all the while. Why does he renew the face of the
earth by the mission of his Spirit, but that he may rejoice in his
works? 'Thou sends forth thy Spirit, they are created: and thou renews
the face of the earth. The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: the
Lord shall rejoice in his works,' Ps. civ. 30, 31. If God shall in time
rejoice in the earth, wherein he had little joy after the creation of
it, and soon repented of his work, he will rejoice in the noblest work,
in the frame of his image, which, next to Christ, makes all other works
of the lower creation pleasant to him. He 'creates Jerusalem a
rejoicing, and her people a joy,' and he will rejoice in the new
creation of his people, in the people he has new created, Isa lxv. 18,
19.

(2.) He will destroy all enemies to his own work. How will his love
pierce into every part, and employ his poser in destroying the enemies
of his work; whip buyers and sellers out of his spiritual temple, cast
out all their remaining rubbish; let not his house be always a den of
thieves, that shall rob God of his glory, and his temple of its beauty!
That God that can raise men five thousand years ago dead as easily as
one dead the last minute, can remove all the bands of corruption, though
never so strong. If he has raised you from death, he will lift you up
from all the remainders of death; the grave-clothes which yet remain
about you, shall be in time untied, as well as the soul unloosed from
the principal bands of death. Though there be in you a ' spirit that
lusts to envy,' as well as a spirit that lusts to love, yet 'God gives
more grace,' James iv. 5, a. Lusts will down, corruptions fall in time
before his grace, darkness must hide its hated head, when that word
breaks louder from his lips, 'Let there be light.' The promises of a
thorough sanctification belong to you, as well as the promises of a
perfect remission. If God be the teacher, no matter what the scholar is;
if God be the workman, no matter what the matter is; if God be the
guardian, no matter what the enemies are; nothing is too rugged for his
skill, or too hard for his power.

(3.) He will order all things for the good of his own work. 'They shall
not labour in vain; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord,'
Isa. lxv. 23. He did not want grace to restore them, he will not want
comforts to support them. Their very afflictions shall be ordered to
preserve the work of his own heart in them; and while he prunes and
cuts, he will purge away the luxuriant corruptions, that his vine may be
more beautiful and delicious. And if he does chasten you sharply, it is
that you may be nearer 'partakers of his holiness,' Heb. xii. 10.

Use 3. The third use is of exhortation.

1\. To the renewed.

(1.) Walk humbly. Swell not big, as if your own power had procured it,
let not pride spread its sails in your souls. Consider, you are
creatures still, though new creatures. As God put into you whatsoever
you have of natural existence, so he has put into you whatsoever you
have of spiritual; you are dust still by your natural creation, though
new formed by the Spirit. There is nothing of grace, no act of grace,
but you receive mediately or immediately from God. You opened not your
own eves, nor thrust back the lock of your own hearts, nor can call one
spark of that spiritual life you have, your own creature; it moved not
at your beck, obeyed not your orders; it is when God says, Go, that it
goes, and, Do this and that, Settle upon this or that soul, and it does
it. How humble should you be, since grace does nothing in any but by
God's order, not your own. God works in us, we add nothing to God. The
melted wax receives the stamp from the seal, but the wax adds nothing to
the seal. 'What hast thou that thou hast not received?' 'If thou did
receive it, why dost thou boast as if thou had not received it?' 1 Cor.
iv. 7. Grace is God's communication to you, not yours to yourselves.
What is received, is not your own work, but another's gift; were it
desert, we had reason to boast; but being a gift, we have no reason to
grow big. Lie therefore before him in your own nothingness. Renewing
grace first lighted upon you when you were humble; and grace in its
increase flourishes when the soul is in the same posture.

(2 ) Ascribe all that you are, as renewed creatures, to God. Ascribe it
wholly to him; let self rub off every filing of this gold from its own
fingers. 'Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord, but unto thy name be the
praise,' Ps. cxv. 1. The repetition removes the glory far from
themselves. If praise be comely for an upright person, it is most comely
in the greatest cause that can happen to him, Ps. xxxiii. 1. Account
yourselves therefore nothing, and God and grace all; and let no
shootings be heard in your souls while God is rearing up the divine
temple, but those of Grace! Grace! Zech. iv. 7, both in the foundation
and superstructure, till he comes to the top stone. Your breathing after
God is but the effect of his breathing after you; the moon has no light
of herself, but what she receives from the sun; nor any creature a spark
of grace, but what is derived from the Father of lights. God's purity is
as the sun, your grace as a beam from that sun, not primitive in your
nature, but derivative from God. Were it not from grace, Saul had never
been Paul, nor Peter a penitent, nor Mary a convert, nor Zacchaeus a
Christian, nor had thou ever been brought to the sweetness of a
spiritual life, or advanced to the state and comforts of another world.
Did you will to run till mercy moved your wills and spirited the feet of
your souls? Your will, your race, was nothing; God's grace was all, Rom
ix. 16. Was it not his word of command, Let there be life? Was it not
his invincible power battered down the strongholds of sin? Oh seriously
think, O Christian, that dry and desert heart of thine could never have
been mollified and watered by rocky nature, nor virtue ever bud and
blossom in that barren soil, unless the soil were mended, as well as the
plant fixed, by some powerful hand. Bless God, therefore, since had it
not been for him, you had never been humbled, never been renewed, never
reached so high as a holy desire, or a penitential tear, but lain till
this day, and for ever, bemired in fallen nature.

That you may know what reason you have to bless God with the highest
praises, consider,

\[1.\] What your obligation is, how great! What good would your creation
have done you since your fall without a new creation by the same hand?
It must have rendered you miserable without this, and could never have
rendered you happy but by the intervention of this. Without this you
might have been his sons and daughters by creation, and devils by
corruption. The heathens were God's offspring, as they were rational
creatures, Acts xvii. 28, and the devil's children, as they were corrupt
creatures. You might have had the image of God in a glimmering reason,
without his image in a divine holiness. Was it not a greater obligation
to restore that with kinder circumstances which you had wilfully thrown
away, when it was in no wise due to you, than it was at first to bestow
it? There was something like debt at first; supposing God would create a
rational creature, integrity and innocence was naturally due to it, in
regard of the holiness and wisdom of God, unless he would have been the
author of the creature's sinfulness; but since that voluntary defection,
the restoration was in no sort due, therefore the obligation greater. If
God had created a thousand worlds, and given you the lordship of them
for some millions of years, had this been such a kindness as to afford
you a new nature, whereby you will be eternally happy in a likeness to
God and enjoyment of him? As the work of redemption, so this of
regeneration, darkens the glory of the work of creation; since more of
grace, wisdom, power, holiness, are the springs of it, the obligation
must be far greater; the difference is as great as between heaven and
earth. Will you not bless God for making you creatures, for recovery
from a fit of sickness? Is the obligation less in delivering you from a
spiritual death? Is not the reason of blessing God greater for the
second creation than the first, since it is the same skill adorns you
with his image in the new creation, which beautified man with that image
at the first?

\[2.\] Was there not as much unfitness in you as in the worst of men by
nature? Not one good disposition grew upon nature, but all was the work
of preventing grace. Could, then, the iron gates of your hearts fly open
of themselves? Or could any else but a God break them open? Was not your
nature carried as violently to sin as any, perhaps not into such brutish
sins as others, yet more refined and devilish? If you did not launch out
into the grossest sins, you owe your preservation to restraining grace.
That Socrates was better and wiser than another, was from God, in the
acknowledgement of a heathen, who says he was chosen to virtue, "Kata
tou Theou cheirotonian", by the divine suffrage. Were your strings
better? Sure they were of God's tuning. Man was not more unfit for a
natural being before God created him, than the best man in the world was
for a spiritual being, till God wrought him with his own finger. Was not
the worst in the world naturally as fit for it as yourselves? Did any
better thing dwell in your flesh than in theirs, to give grace
entertainment? Did not grace at first make its way, conquering, and to
conquer, and not one blow struck by you to facilitate the victory? Nay,
were you not so far from having a grain of grace by nature, that there
was nothing but opposition and rebellion against the Author of it? Did
you not want everything to make you lovely in God's eye? Nay, did you
not hate him while he had a love of benevolence towards you? And have
you not reason to bless him then, that he would not disdain to look upon
you, such an impure and rebellious creature? Perhaps our case was the
same with hers, Hos. ii. 5, who said, 'I will go after my lovers.' She
decreed to follow her idols, and was resolved not to be reclaimed; but
God resolved otherwise, ver. 6, 7, who would not leave her till he had
made her change her base and unworthy resolution for better: 'She shall
say, I will return, &c.' And was it not a happy resolution in the divine
breast, not to suffer you to run mad and furiously to bell? What an
irrecoverable condition had you been in if God had not spoken a powerful
word, 'Hitherto thou art gone, but no further shalt thou go!' Were you
not once in your blood, and pitied by no eye, when God said, Live? And
can you not wonder at the mercy of his lips, and raise your notes above
an ordinary strain? Read over the records of the first work upon thy
heart, and see if anything were written there with thy own finger. The
very sense of thy own wretchedness was God's writing on thy heart; thou
was weighed in the balances and found wanting; lighter than vanity,
nothing of thy own to concur with God, but folly and misery.

\[3.\] If grace found thee unfit and rebellious, there could then be
nothing of the least desert; and this should make you cast a wondering
eye at the greatness of God's kindness. Man's voluntary defection,
without any violence offered to him, had rendered him unworthy of any
recovery; you did no more deserve it than the worst devil, who shall
never have one line of it drawn upon him. Not one previous disposition,
not one sigh or groan for it, could be discerned, much less the draught
itself. Your true earnings were nothing but that death you lay under.
The unloosing any band of it, or knocking off any fetter, was merely
free grace. Is there not, then, reason to bless the Lord, when an
undeserved power has been put forth to new create you, when a deserved
power might have buried you for ever under your own ruins? Suppose you
had been the most exact moralists in the world, the supernatural grace
of the new birth could not be deserved by you, because nothing can be
merited but by an act as excellent as the reward. No man can merit by
any act a thing of a greater value than the act itself; but this grace
is of another order, and far superior to any moral natural work. Indeed,
upon covenant, if a man does such a thing, he shall have such a reward,
the thing promised may be challenged upon the performing the condition,
but cannot be said to be merited, because the act was inferior to the
reward in the true value of it, but this grace could neither be merited
nor challenged at God's hand upon a condition, since he had made no
promise in this kind to give you a right to such a demand. It is one
thing to be capable of it, another thing to have a just right. A sinner
in the state of sin is capable of being changed, but not capable of
having a right to that change. Well, then, you could never deserve such
a mercy; and will you prize it and bless God for it?

\[4 \] Since you did not deserve it, no, nor the proposals of it,
consider what a condition you had been in had God left you to
yourselves, or put your wills only into an indifference. Had it been by
a mere suasion, or a naked proposition of the truth, I suppose you are
so sensible of the mutability of your wills, that you might well believe
you should scarce have complied with God. Your security at best had been
but as good as Adam's, who had his *posse* but not his *velle*. What
furious passions and devils in your souls were set against him! and had
you been left to your own choice, you would not have stirred one foot to
follow his chariot. If you did 'purify your souls in obeying the truth,'
it was 'through the Spirit,' 1 Peter i. 22; and all the faith you have
was from the same fountain, Acts xviii. 27, 'which believed through
grace.' Put it to yourselves: Do you think your hearts were not so
stout, that nothing but divine grace could mollify them? Do you think
there would have been any heat or warmth in you unless God had kindled
the flame? Can you imagine your frozen hearts would have melted but by a
divine breath? It was happy for you that God would put your wills beyond
an indifference, and deal with you by the same power as he dealt with
Christ, not leaving him or you in a doubtful state between life and
death. How happy was it for you that God would be conqueror, and
surmount your resistance, tame your force, scatter your counsels, level
your mountain, and bring your fierceness under the yoke; that he would
not wait your choice and leisure, but make the event certain; that he
had mercy on you, because he would have mercy; that he would turn the
stream of your hearts by the overmastering tide of his grace, and
overpower the flesh in the chief parts of your souls, and secure the
rational powers of mind and will for himself! How glad may you be of the
loss of that indifference that secures your happy estate for ever! Who
that is in favour with a prince would not willingly have his will fixed
to please him, and dread nothing more than such an indifference, whereby
he might hate his prince and lose his favour?

\[5.\] Is there not reason you should bless God, when he has dealt thus
graciously with you, and not with many others in the world, why any of
you should be raised up to a spiritual life, when you see many others
near you stretched out in a spiritual death; why one upon the same bench
and not another; why one should be gathered with his arm, and another
left to the jaws of the devouring lion, why you should have any choice
fruit grow in any of your hearts, when thorns and briers grow in every
hedge? That God should have afforded you means of regeneration, and not
to most others in the world, is a ground of blessing and praise, much
more that he should afford you the grace of regeneration, and not to
many others under the same means. He has not dealt so with every nation
in giving them the means, Ps. cxlvii. 19; he has not dealt so with every
person in giving them the grace. That wind that blows where it lists has
left other dry bones to remain dry still, passed by others more civil
and of sweeter conversations; drawn his image in one, and left others to
tumble down to hell in the likeness of Adam, wherein they were born,
overlooked one that was not far from the kingdom of heaven, and laid
hold on another that was many leagues further from Christ. The Spirit of
God only makes this distinction: he will pour out his grace in Galatia
and Macedonia, and not suffer it to be known in Bithynia: Acts xvi. 6-8,
'And they essayed to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered them
not;' cause it to rain in one city, on one person, and not on another;
call one out of the grave, and leave others under the bands of death and
in the dregs of human nature. You see your calling, and you may see how
distinguishing it is, 'not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty,'
1 Cor. i. 26. Can you see this and not bless the caller, the renewer? A
less favour wrought so much upon David's heart that he would bless God
in spite of mocks and scoffs, 2 Sam. vi. 21. Oh rich discriminating
grace! Where any are peculiar monuments of grace, they should have
peculiar notes of praise. What reason can others have to bless God, if
such should have no hearts to bless him for so great a mercy? All are
under God's will of precept, all are under his will of promise, if they
perform that precept; but all are not under his will of purpose, to give
them strength to perform that precept.

\[6.\] It is to be considered, too, with what pains and patience God
wrought this work in your hearts. You may best know what ado God had
with your hearts before they were thus formed according to his will.
Were they not as clay to the potter, which needed much tempering before
they were fit for use? Did God find that pliableness in you that the
devil found? Had he a cordial welcome at the first proffer? Do you not
remember resistance enough to make you for ever ashamed that ever you
should put the blessed God to that toil? And yet you know not the
thousandth part of that resistance God knew was lodged in your nature.
Do you not remember how he met you at every turn, hedged up your
perverse way with thorns, before he could be admitted to speak a word to
your heart, how he answered one objection after another, whereby you
would have stifled his work? Can you remember this, and not admire the
mercy that took such pains with so unprofitable a heart? It is called a
resurrection, but it is more. Before the resurrection of the body, one
part of man lives and waits for reunion though the body be crumbled into
very dust; but there is no life in you naturally: so little in you to
take part with God, that even that which is the glory of man, his mind,
and reason, and wisdom, were in arms against this work, as well as the
sensitive and brutish part, for 'the carnal mind was enmity against
God,' Rom. viii. 7. What was your language to God at first, but like
that of the hellish spirit in the man in Luke iv. 34: 'What have we to
do with thee?' Yet he dealt with you as the sun with the earth, which
scatters the mists it sends out to choke its light, and spreads its warm
wings over the face of the world. So does God, though men offend him
with the steams of their sins, and uncivilly command him to depart from
them, yet he leaves them not till he has made them willing that he
should do them good.

\[7.\] The work itself requires admiration and blessing in regard of the
excellency of it. It is more admirable than all the miracles of nature;
the whole world can no more compare with it than a dunghill can equal
the worth of a rock of diamonds; all blessings which make you happy
spiritually and eternally are wrapped up in it. What can God give
greater than his own nature? What are you capable of more than what he
has done and will do upon that foundation? If God had only given thee
knowledge, thou might have been a devil for all that; but the new nature
makes you equal with angels. What man or angel could you be born of with
so great advantage as to be born of God? There is no higher being to be
born of. What can he do more than thus to beget you? You are new-born
according to that image after which his only Son was eternally begotten;
conceived by that Spirit whereby Christ was conceived in the womb of the
blesses Virgin; raised by the same almighty hand whereby the great
pattern of the new birth was raised from the dead. It is the highest
elevation of human nature to be united to the Son of God, and to be made
like to that glorious image. Greater gifts cannot be than these two,
Christ to descend to partake of human nature, and the creature elevated
to partake of the divine. If you will not loudly bless him for this,
what can God do that shall deserve your praise, since a greater he
cannot confer, more full of the spirits of his favour towards you?

\[8.\] May there not be some circumstances in your particular new birth
that may raise your hearts to blessing and praise? Perhaps thou were
'born in a day,' as his promise is of a nation, Isa. lxvi. 7, 8, and
without those racking pains which attend the new birth of many. He did
not take thee by the throat, nor arrest thee with legal terrors, but
breathed upon thee with a gentle wind; conceived and formed thee in a
little space of time, that thou were within the prospect of heaven
before thou thought thyself out of the suburbs of hell, and brought thee
forth a man-child before thou didn't imagine thyself to be delivered.
Was it not mercy to renew thee without worrying thee; to melt thee by a
gentle fire of love, not break thee piece-meal by the hammer of wrath,
that thou should scarce discern the lance from the balsam, and the wound
from the plaster? Perhaps he arrested thee in a full course of sin, in
some desperate career, when some plot was laid for a high piece of
wickedness. It had been an act of his power had thou been brought up in
some religious family, tutored in the ways of religion by a choicer
education; but perhaps God took thee from the very steams of hell, when
thou had not one thought of him, and he might have let thee alone as
well as he did others of thy companions. It had been admirable power to
turn clear water into wine, but more to turn stinking and putrefied
water into a generous wine. Do not the visible characters of mercy and
power in such a case call for more praise at thy hands? Can any other
cause have a pretence to put in for a share in thy acknowledgements?

\[9.\] You are not without many examples to move you to this
acknowledgement. Our Saviour himself could not regard the centurion's
faith without astonishment. He wondered at that in his humanity which he
wrought himself by his divinity, Mat. viii. 10. And when Peter professes
his faith in him by acknowledging him to be the Son of God, Christ
presently owns his Father as the author of it: Mat. xvi. 17, 'Flesh and
blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.'
Angels sang both at the first and second creation, and shouted for joy
when the corner-stone thereof was laid, Job xxxviii. 6, 7. When they saw
its beautiful order, they then showed themselves to be the sons of God
indeed, in glorifying their Father for his incomparable works. The
second creation being more glorious than the first, is not celebrated by
them with fainter shootings; if God has then hallelujahs for you, it is
fit he should have hallelujahs from you. If angels speak loud, it is not
fit you should speak low; it is their concern, as they are God's friends
and servants; your concern, as you are his workmanship, of his own
carving. The saints in all ages of the church have led the way in this
acknowledgement. The elders, made kings and priests on earth, in a
conquest of Satan and their own hearts, crowned with a blessed grace,
cast down their crowns at the feet of God Rev. ix. 11, 'For thou hast
created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created,'
both the present new creation and the old. 'Thou hast loosed my bonds,'
Ps. cxvi. 16. What follows? 'I will offer to thee the sacrifice of
thanksgiving.' And God's renewing David's youth like the eagle's, his
changing him into a new man, says Jerome, is one argument of David's
praise, Ps. ciii. 6. Add to this, heathens have acknowledged it to be
the work of God, one examining the reason why Homer calls virtuous men
"dious", answers. Because goodness was not a work of art, but "ergon
Dios". If divining and mystical knowledge be "theiai tini epipnoiai", by
divine inspiration, shall we say of virtue it is "ergon technes
thentes", the work of man's art? Where do you find any like
Nebuchadnezzar, gazing upon the divine formation in his own heart, and
proudly crying out, 'Is not this great Babylon which I have built?' Does
such language drop from a David's mouth? No; but 'thou hast quickened
me.' Or from Paul? No, 'by grace I am what I am.' Every inch, every
spark, every joint of the new man is from grace.

\[10.\] If you do not acknowledge it to God, and bless him for it, you
may justly suspect you are not born of him. It is the nature of true
grace to reflect back upon God, as it is of a sunbeam shining upon a
wall to reflect back upon the sun. Blessing God for it, is a character
of a renewed man. It is an evidence of the ruin of the contradiction of
nature against God, when man can strip himself of all, and own God the
prime fountain of what he is and has. If a man boast of his being the
cause of a new birth in himself by any work of his own, it is a shrewd
sign he is not renewed, because by such boasting he crosses the main end
of the gospel, which is to stain the pride of man, and debase him to the
dust from all grounds of glorying in himself. How jealous was the
apostle in this case, and therefore backs his assertion again and again,
that he might beat man's hands off from fingering anything of God's
glory: Eph. ii. 5, 'By grace you are saved;' again, verse 8, 9, 'and
that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.' Once again, 'Not of
works.' And the reason why he is thus earnest, was perpetually to
discountenance self-confidence, 'lest any man should boast.' The design
of God in all gospel dispensations, is to pull away the stool whereon
the flesh sits to glory: 1 Cor i. 29-31, 'That no flesh should glory in
his presence.' It would seem strange that the new birth, a main gospel
work, should be wrought without promoting a gospel end. To have a new
birth, and such a flourishing pride, opposite to the end of it, is a
contradiction. If the doctrine of faith does exclude boasting, as Rom.
iii. 27, boasting is 'excluded by the law of faith,' the grace of faith
also will exclude it; where the new birth is wrought, pride, the great
enemy to it, will surely be captivated. We are then something in and by
God, when we are most nothing in ourselves.

Well, then, be much in the work of praising God, who shined into thy
heart when it was dark, and sealed instruction to thee; who took away
the stony heart, and introduced one of flesh in the room; who manifested
a day of power in the night of your weakness. Can you, dare you, to
ascribe it to yourselves? Let God then have the praise. It is our fault
we are more in complaints of what we want, than acknowledgements of what
we have. Oh, rob not God of his deity, pretend not yourselves partners
with him in the least of the stock. The more you return the glory of his
grace, the more will he return the comfort of it to you; the more you
give him that glory he is so jealous of, the more he will give you that
grace he is so liberal of.

(3.) A third duty for those that are renewed. Acknowledge God in all the
changes you see in others. Miracles must be regarded. It is greater for
the apostles to act with new hearts than to speak with new tongues;
greater than to stop the sun in its course, which would set all the
world upon an astonished gaze. Shall any such miraculous work be done in
our view, and we stand only as stupid spectators, and not render to God
that glory which is due to him for his choicest work? As the sight and
consideration of the material creation kept up the notion of the being
of God as creator, so the consideration of his works upon the souls of
men will quicken thy sentiments of God as a new creator. One is an
argument to prove the power of his essence, the other an argument of the
power of his grace. Noah does not bless them first for that act of
filial duty showed to his father, but blesses God as the author of that
modesty Shem had shown in covering his father's nakedness: Gen. ix. 26,
'Blessed be the God of Shem.' When a great number were turned to Christ,
Barnabas presently cast up his eye to the grace of God, 'he saw the
grace of God,' Acts xi. 21-23. Let every Lazarus you see raised from the
grave raise up your faith to a higher elevation, and dress it in a
jubilee attire. When you see a new temple reared to God, own it as the
Lord's doing, and let it be marvellous in your eyes.

(4.) Be content with every condition your new creator shall cast you
into. Discontent at any of God's dispensations does ill become one whom
God has new begotten to a glorious inheritance. What can he do more than
he has done, and what he will do upon that foundation? All that he acts
is to further that which he has so powerfully and mercifully begun. What
son would repine at the losing a rattle, as long as he is born to a
never-fading inheritance? If grace has put forth a power to new create
you, it will not use that power otherwise than for your good. It may
contradict your carnal desires, not your spiritual interest. Well may
any man be content with the jewel that is left, though the casket be
lost. All things are too light if put into the balance with the new
birth: the dearest husband or wife, the sweetest children or friends,
the most flourishing inheritance; study, therefore, contentment in the
worst condition upon this ground; you know not how soon you may be put
to practise all your skill. Do you not see the heavens gathering
blackness over your heads? A new birth, that allies us to God as his
children, will be of more force to settle us, than calamities can be to
discompose us; for never was child so dear to an earthly, as a new
created soul is to its heavenly Father.

(5.) Walk worthy of the author of it. A verbal acknowledgement will
signify little without a real imitation of the virtues of him 'that has
called you out of darkness into his marvellous light,' 1 Peter ii. 9. A
holiness is to be expressed by you, like the holiness of that God who
has renewed you. Let no devilish or brutish carriage be yoked with a
divine birth, indeed it cannot; the bespotting corruption of the world
will not agree with the regeneration of the soul; the stains of the
flesh are inconsistent with the purity of the new nature. Belial and
Christ, God and Satan, are not joint begetters; Satan's impure
breathings upon you should not be admitted to mix with the breath of
God. A new nature by grace must not imitate a brutish nature by sin; a
soul born of God must not be fashioned according to the world. If you
differ from the world in your nature by grace, differ from the world
also in your carriage by holiness. It is uncomely for one born of God to
be taken with the foolish, flaunting pride of the world, more than the
pattern God has set him; that is, to imitate beasts, not a heavenly
Father. The world is little, nothing, vanity in the eye of God; so
should it be in the eye of a divinely begotten soul. Use the world as
travellers an inn, to lodge, not to dwell in, to accommodate you in your
journey to that Father of whom you were born. Let a heaven-born nature
be attended with heavenly flights, longing for that happy state wherein
nothing but the divine nature shall be seen in union, as nothing but
fire is seen in melted gold.

(6.) Mourn for your imperfections. Give God his due, and grieve for your
defect in paving him his own. The soul in creation comes pure out of
God's hand, but it is poisoned by the flesh, and the impurity in the
sensitive part of man. Though your grace be from God, yet your
imperfections are from yourselves. The waters that run through sulphur
and alum mines flow from the sea, but the ill taste and scent are
communicated by the matter it mixes with in its passage. God is the
author of your faith, but not of the weakness of your faith; the author
of your love, but not of the coldness of your love; the author of your
zeal, but not of the faintness of your zeal. Chide your hearts,
therefore for your weakness, as Christ did his disciples for their
slowness in faith. 'Rejoice with trembling,' Ps. ii. 11, rejoice in what
you have, and mourn for chat you want and come short in. Reason you
have, since there is too much of the power of nature remaining with our
best grace, so that it may be said of it, as Lot of Zoar, What grace has
enclosed is but a little one.

Exhort. 2. To those that are not born of God. You see at whose hands you
are to seek it. God was the first contriver of the gospel, the first
preacher of the gospel, the sole artist in any gospel operation. No man
can come except the Father draw him; not some men, but no man; every man
must therefore seek to this great attracter. It is a vanity of human
nature, that every man loves to be "autodidaktos", his own teacher; and
no less a vanity it is, that every man loves to be "autogennetos", his
own begetter. Men glory in the knowledge they get without a teacher, and
no less glory in any change they can hammer out without a spiritual
Father. As he that scorns to be taught by another shall surely have a
fool to his tutor, so he that thinks to gain spiritual life by himself,
shall be sure to have death for his quickener. No man would seek life
from death, or light from darkness, and the best natural man is no
better. The glory of the Lord must rise upon us, before we can rise out
of our death in sin: 'Arise, and shine, for thy light is come, and the
glory of the Lord is risen upon thee,' Isa. lx. 1.

(1.) Seek it only at the hands of God. It is not to be had by outward
rules, but divine influence; the streams of life must come from him,
since with him only is the fountain of life: Ps. xxxvi. 9, 'I will give
a heart of flesh;' I alone, without any other co-ordinate cause, either
man or angel. He only has the key of the heart, as well as that of the
womb; confide not in yourselves. Adam was a root to convey sin and
death, but no root to convey spiritual life. Corruption comes by
propagation from him, grace only by spiritual regeneration from God.
Would any wise man seek for water in a desert, or for grace from
himself, who is naturally a dry wilderness? What toad, naturally full of
poison, ever made himself sweet and wholesome? As Christ was by the
grace of God made partaker of our nature in his incarnation, so by the
same grace only can we be made partakers of his nature by regeneration.
We are naturally weeds; if ever we be flowers in God's garden, the
transformation must be God's act alone.

Seek it of God. But,

\[1.\] In the use of means, not abating anything of thine own industry.
Seek, while God offers it; hold your mouth under the fountain while it
runs. Moses hewed the tables, but God wrote the law. God promised David
and Gideon victory, but not with their hands in their pockets, but their
arms and armies about them. Moses must fight with the arms of Israel,
but pray to the God of battles and victory. We must with one hand use
the directions God has given, and lift up the other in spiritual
supplication for success upon them. Therefore let not the doctrine of
God's being the cause of the new birth encourage your laziness and
sloth. This sloth among men Chemnitius thought to be the occasion of
Pelagius his error, who, seeing the laziness of Christians, thought to
correct it by making them think highly of their own strength; but that
was a dangerous extreme.

\[2.\] Yet let your eye be solely upon God in the use of them, since all
the means in the world cannot do it without him. Unless God pull up the
floodgates, no water of life can stream into the soul; means can no more
of themselves cast out death than the disciples could cast out some
devils; but Christ was able to do what they could not. All the angels in
heaven and men upon earth have not been able, these almost six thousand
years, to make one fly; yet all the angels and the whole frame of the
world were made by God in six days. Men speak to the sense, God to the
heart; they to the understanding, and God into it; men argue with the
will, and God persuades it. All the clamours of the whole nation of the
Jews, yea, of all the men in the world, would not have made Lazarus stir
out of the grave, had not our Saviour spoken the word, 'Lazarus, come
forth.' How often do the clouds of heaven drop upon men, yet they still
remain as a dry chip, their stony hearts perhaps moistened with some
transient flashy affections, but not mollified into flesh. Pray
therefore to God, before the use of any means, Lord, breathe life so
powerfully upon me, that I may walk before thee, and never find myself
again in a natural winding-sheet. Let thy voice, Lord, be heard and felt
by me as the voice of thy Son was by Lazarus. To use means without a
seeking to God for his blessing, is to be exercised in divine
institutions with an atheistic spirit. He is an atheist that expects
nourishment from his meat without God's benediction, and he no less that
runs to means without lifting up his heart to God, thinking to get grace
conveyed by the means without God's operation.

(2.) Direction. Plead much with God from the glorious attributes he
honours in this work. Lord, here is a subject for thy power to work
upon. God made the heavens when there was nothing but a rude mass; he
brought forth the sun, moon, and stars, with all their glory, out of the
barren womb of nothing. Is thy heart worse than nothing, more
contradictory to God than nothing? It is so. Assume an argument from
hence: Lord, here is a subject for thy power above what was manifested
in creation; there is not a more tough heart in the world than mine;
lose not the opportunity of displaying the greatness of thy power, since
there is scarce a heart more stout and unwieldy than mine is. Lord,
bestow a vital principle upon me; thou did it to the lifeless body of
Adam; thy power will be more magnified in the breathing upon a lifeless
soul of a son and daughter of Adam. In the same manner plead his wisdom
and holiness. Plead also the enmity thy sin has against him, the wrong
it has done him, in spoiling the creation, changing the end of it,
hindering thee from thy natural duty, and that it is not for the
interest of his glory to let sin bear such a sway and dominion, and
usurp his room in one who would fain be another man.

(3.) Be deeply sensible of the corruption of thy nature; the want of
this is the cause there is so little sense in men and women of the
absolute necessity of the grace of regeneration, and a change of nature.
Therefore labour to see yourselves in a forlorn condition by spiritual
death. Look upon your great fall as a son of Adam, a slave of Satan, and
possessor of a hellish nature, and at a vast distance from God and
happiness.

(4.) Grieve not the Spirit in any of his operations. Quench not the
sparks of the Spirit in any previous preparations and dispositions to
this new birth. Be pliable to his breathings, hoist up your sails to
receive his gales; when he knocks, open thy heart as wide as may be,
push it to the furthest point, that there may be no *remora;* let all
the house be free for his triumphant entrance. Since thy strength is too
weak for it, beg of him at such a season to break it open; set upon
prayer at such a season, and leave not till you have prayed your spirits
up and your resistance out. How ungrateful and foolish is it to grieve
that Spirit, who offers to form you into a new birth, and bring the life
and joy of heaven into your heart! This is the only means to recover the
loss you had by the fall of Adam, and surmount all the misery of it.
Seek to him; he that can gather the dust of your bodies, if blown to the
further part of the world, and knit it together, can overcome the filthy
and deadly noisomeness of your souls; he can make a barren wilderness to
become pools of water, a lump of vanity a garden of pleasure, a heap of
rubbish to sprout up a new-born sun. If you would therefore be animated
with a spirit of life, you must approach the beams of the sun, and lie
under the rich and enlivening influences of it.
