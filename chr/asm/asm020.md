## CHAPTER XVII

###  

### OF KINDLINESS

###  

Out of the same source wherein meekness takes its rise springs
kindliness, for none can be kind save the meek man.

This kindness makes a man show a friendly face, and give a cordial
response, and do compassionate deeds, to those who are quarrelsome, when
he hopes that they will come to know themselves and mend their ways.

By gentleness and kindness, charity is kept quick and fruitful in man,
for a heart full of kindness is like a lamp full of precious oil; for
the oil of mercy enlightens the erring sinner with good example, and
with words and works of comfort it anoints and heals those whose hearts
are wounded or grieved or perplexed. And it is a fire and a light for
those who dwell in the virtues, in the fire of charity; and neither
jealousy nor envy can perturb it.
