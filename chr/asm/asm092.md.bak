## CHAPTER LXII

 

### SHOWING HOW WE SHOULD GO OUT TO MEET GOD

 

Now mark how, in each of our works, we shall go out to meet God, and
shall increase our likeness unto Him, and shall more nobly possess the
fruitive unity. By every good work, how small soever it be, which is
directed to God with love and with an upright and single intention, we
earn a greater likeness, and eternal life in God. A single intention
draws together the scattered powers into the unity of the spirit, and
joins the spirit to God. A single intention is end, and beginning, and
adornment, of all virtues. A single intention offers to God praise and
honour and all virtues: and it pierces and passes through itself, and
all the heavens, and all things, and finds God within the simple ground
of its own being. That intention is single which aims only at God and in
all things only at their connection with God. The single intention casts
out hypocrisy and duplicity, and a man must possess it and practise it
in all his works above all other things; for it is this which keeps man
in the presence of God, clear in understanding, diligent in virtue, and
free from outward fear, both now and in the Day of Doom. Singleness of
intention is the single eye of which Christ speaks, giving light to the
whole body—that is, to the man's works and his whole life and cleansing
it of sin. Singleness of intention is the inward, enlightened, and
loving tendency of the spirit; it is the foundation of all ghostliness;
it includes in itself faith, hope, and charity, for it trusts in God and
is faithful to Him. It casts nature underfoot, it establishes peace, it
drives out ghostly discontent, and preserves fulness of life in all the
virtues. And it gives peace and hope and boldness toward God, both now
and in the Day of Doom.

Thus we shall dwell in the unity of the spirit, in grace and in
likeness; and shall always go out to meet God by means of the virtues,
and offer up to Him with a simple intention our whole life and all our
works; and thus in every work, and ever more and more, we shall increase
our likeness. And thus we rise up out of the ground of our single
intention, and pass through ourselves and go out to meet God without
means, and rest in Him in the abyss of simplicity: there we possess that
heritage which has been prepared for us from all eternity. All ghostly
life and all works of virtue consist in the Divine likeness and in
singleness of intention; and all their supreme rest consists in
simplicity above all likeness. Nevertheless, one spirit surpasses
another in virtue and in likeness, and each possess its own proper being
in itself, according to the degree of its nobleness. And God suffices
each one in particular, and each one, according to the measure of his
love, seeks God in the ground of his spirit; both here and in eternity.
