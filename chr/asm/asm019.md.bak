## CHAPTER XVI

 

### OF MEEKNESS

 

From this patience there spring meekness and kindliness, for none can be
meek in adversity save the patient man.

Meekness gives a man peace and rest in all things. For the meek man can
bear provoking words and ways, uncivil looks and deeds, and every kind
of injustice towards himself and his friends, and yet in all things
remain in peace, for meekness is peaceful endurance.

By meekness the irascible or repulsive power remains unmoved, in
quietude; the desirous power is uplifted toward virtue; the rational
power, perceiving this, rejoices. And the conscience, tasting it, rests
in peace; for the second mortal sin, Anger, fury, or wrath, has been
cast out. For the Spirit of God dwells in the humble and the meek; and
Christ says: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth,
that is, their own nature and all earthly things, in meekness; and after
that the Country of Life in Eternity.
