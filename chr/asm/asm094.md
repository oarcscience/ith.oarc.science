## CHAPTER LXIV

 

### OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF THE MOST INTERIOR LIFE

 

Now understand this well: that measureless Splendour of God, which
together with the incomprehensible brightness, is the cause of all gifts
and of all virtues—that same Uncomprehended Light transfigures the
fruitive tendency of our spirit and penetrates it in a way that is
wayless; that is, through the Uncomprehended Light. And in this light
the spirit immerses itself in fruitive rest; for this rest is wayless
and fathomless, and one can know of it in no other way than through
itself—that is, through rest. For, could we know and comprehend it, it
would fall into mode and measure; then it could not satisfy us, but rest
would become an eternal restlessness. And for this reason, the simple,
loving and immersed tendency of our spirit works within us a fruitive
love; and this fruitive love is abysmal. And the abyss of God calls to
the abyss; that is, of all those who are united with the Spirit of God
in fruitive love. This inward call is an inundation of the essential
brightness, and this essential brightness, enfolding us in an abysmal
love, causes us to be lost to ourselves, and to flow forth from
ourselves into the wild darkness of the Godhead. And, thus united
without means, and made one with the Spirit of God, we can meet God
through God, and everlastingly possess with Him and in Him our eternal
bliss.
