# THE SECOND BOOK

 

## PROLOGUE

 

The wise virgin, that is the pure soul, having abandoned earthly things,
and living according to the virtues for God, has taken in the vessel of
her heart the oil of charity and of godly deeds, with the lamp of an
unsullied conscience. But when Christ the Bridegroom tarries with His
consolations, and the renewed inpouring of His gifts, the soul becomes
drowsy, sleepy, and inert. Then, at midnight, when it is least expected,
a ghostly cry is made within the soul: Behold, the Bridegroom, cometh,
go ye out to meet Him. Of this beholding, and of the inward coming of
Christ, and of a man's ghostly going out, and of his meeting with
Christ; of these four points we will now speak, and we will explain and
apply them according to an inward, lofty, God-desiring life, which all
cannot reach, but which many men attain through the moral virtues and
inward zeal.

By these words Christ teaches us four things. First, that He wills that
our understanding should be enlightened by supernatural light; this we
learn from the word which He speaks: Behold. Secondly, He shows us what
we ought to see: namely, the inward coming of our Bridegroom, the
Eternal Truth; this we understand from His saying: The Bridegroom
cometh. Thirdly, He commands us to go out through inward exercises
according to righteousness; for this reason He says: Go ye out. And, by
the fourth point, He shows us the end and the aim of the whole; that is,
the meeting with our Bridegroom Christ, in the fruitive unity of the
Godhead.
