## CHAPTER L

 

### SHOWING HOW A MAN SHOULD BE ADORNED IF HE IS TO RECEIVE THE MOST INWARD EXERCISE

 

Now consider diligently how we can acquire and possess the most inward
exercise of our spirit in the created light. The man who is well adorned
with the moral virtues of the outward life, and has risen into nobility
and divine peace by inward practices; he possesses the unity of the
spirit, enlightened by supernatural wisdom, flowing forth in generous
love toward heaven and earth and lifting itself up by its reverence and
its merits, and flowing back into that very ground, the most high Unity
of God, from which all things proceed. For each creature, according to
whether it has received more or less from God, has more or less of
ascending love and inward tendency towards its origin; for God and all
His gifts invite us into Him, and through charity and the virtues and
resemblance, we desire to enter into Him.
