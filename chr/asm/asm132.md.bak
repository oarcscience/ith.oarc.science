<span id="fn_37"></span>[38](asm004.htm#fr_37.md) "Light" is the second of
the Divine Names which Dionysius the Areopagite attributes to the
Godhead, being placed by him between "Goodness" and "Beauty"; and his
influence may be traced in Ruysbroeck's frequent use of it. Thus he
says, "Let us now extol the spiritual name of Light, under which we
contemplate the Good; and declare that He is called spiritual Light
because He fills every supercelestial mind with spiritual light,
expelling ignorance and error from all souls in which they may be . . .
the Good is therefore called spiritual Light above all other light: as
fontal Ray and overflowing Stream of light, shining out of its fulness
upon every mind above, around, and in the world, renewing all their
powers, and embracing them in its span. (*Divine Names*, cap. 4.)

<span id="fn_38"></span>[39](asm005.htm#fr_38.md) The word here translated
"conditions" is Ruysbroeck's favourite term, "wise," meaning ways or
modes of being; literally, "how" Christ was as regards each virtue. The
Flemish of this passage reads, "Want alsoe menighe inwendighe doghet,
alsoe menighe inwendighe wise hadde Christus."

<span id="fn_39"></span>[40](asm014.htm#fr_39.md) "Righteousness"
(gherechticheit) must be read here and onwards in the sense, not only of
goodness, but of justice and rightness in the conduct of life. "It is
meet and right so to do."

<span id="fn_40"></span>[41](asm017.htm#fr_40.md) It will be seen that the
description of the virtues in this section, like that of the terraces in
Dante's *Purgatorio*, is arranged upon a definite plan. Each virtue or
group of qualities opposes one of the seven mortal sins, and is
associated with one of the Beatitudes.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[42](asm034.htm#fr_41.md) The three points here
described the enlightenment or impulse of grace, concentration of mind,
and the deliberate expulsion of distracting thoughts and imagesare
summed up in the exercise which ascetic writers call Recollection, and
which prepares consciousness for the contemplative state.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[43](asm038.htm#fr_42.md) The source of this image
seems to be a well-known passage in Dionysius the Areopagite

"That brilliant likeness of the Divine Goodness, our great sun,
all-radiant and ever-shining as a distant echo of the Good, enlightens
all capable of receiving light . . . pouring upon the universe above and
beneath the splendour of its rays. And if anything does not share in
them this is not because of any lack in its distribution of light, but
because of the inaptitude for light of those things which do not unfold
themselves that they may participate in the light." (*Divine Names*,
cap. 4.)

<span id="fn_43"></span>[44](asm049.htm#fr_43.md) The word "weelden," here
translated "rapturous delight," really means a luxury of enjoyment: an
overpassing and voluptuous rapture, in which the soul partakes of the
rich content of God.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[45](asm052.htm#fr_44.md) The "wound of love" as a
metaphor for the rapturous yet piercing entrance of Divine Love into the
heart, meets us again and again in the literature of mysticism. "God,"
says St Basil, "is the Perfect Beauty which inflicts on the soul an
ineffable wound of love." In many cases, as for instance in the
celebrated "transverberation" of St Teresa, this image probably
describes one of those psycho-physical parallelisms—not uncommon in the
records of high religious experience—in which actual bodily pangs
accompany the spiritual crisis. Thus Richard Rolle says, "O thou
everlasting fairness, thou hast wounded my heart; scarcely I live for
joy and almost I die, for I may not in my deadly flesh suffer such a
sweetness of this great majesty." (*The Mending of Life*, cap. 11.)

Thus, too, St John of the Cross  
   
"O burn that burns to heal!  
O more than pleasant wound!  
And O soft hand, O touch most delicate  
That dost new life reveal,  
That dost in grace abound,  
And, slaying, dost from death to life translate."  
(*Llama de Amor Viva*. Trans. by Arthur Symons.)

<span id="fn_45"></span>[46](asm054.htm#fr_45.md) The *Jubilus*, or
inarticulate song of joy, was recognised by medieval writers as a normal
form of religious exaltation: there are many references to it in
mystical literature. Thus Jacopone da Tod in the poem, "*O jubilo del
core"*

   
"The Jubilus in fire awakes  
And straight the man must sing and pray,  
His tongue in childish stammering shakes,  
Nor knows he what his lips may say;  
He cannot quench nor hide away  
That sweetness pure and infinite.  
   
"The Jubilus in flame is lit  
And straight the man must shout and sing;  
So close to love his heart is knit  
He scarce can bear the honeyed sting;  
His clamour and his cries must ring  
And shame for ever take its flight."  
(Laude 76. Trans. by J. Beck.)

<span id="fn_46"></span>[47](asm054.htm#fr_46.md) This is the traditional
Christian test for all visions and revelations. Thus Richard of St.
Victor, the source of so much of Ruysbroeck's teaching, says in a
celebrated passage:

"Even though you believe that you have been taken up into the high
mountain apart, even though you believe that you see Christ
transfigured, be not too ready to believe anything you see in Him or
hear from him, unless Moses and Elias run to meet Him. I hold all truth
in suspicion which Scripture does not confirm: nor do I receive Christ
in His glory unless Moses and Elias are talking with Him." (*Benjamin
Minor*, cap. 81.)

<span id="fn_47"></span>[48](asm055.htm#fr_47.md) Rolle's *Fire of Love*
provides an apt commentary upon this chapter. Thus he says of the devout
and ardent lover who "burns in the fire of the Holy Ghost"

"He utterly burns and longs for light while he thus fervently tastes of
things heavenly . . . as the seraphim, to whom he is like in loving
mind, he cries and says to his noble Lover, 'Behold, loving I burn,
greedily desiring.' Thus with fire untrowed and thirling flame the soul
of a lover is burned. It gladdens all things and heavenlike sparkles:
nor happily do I long to make an end, but, always going to that which I
love, death to me is sweet and sicker." (*Incendium Amoris*, I., cap.
14.)

<span id="fn_48"></span>[49](asm065.htm#fr_48.md) Probably Ruysbroeck had
here in mind such a "fountain" or *lavabo* as was to be seen in almost
any fourteenth century cloister: a cistern or basin fed by a duct of
running water, and pouring itself out in several streams into the lower
basin or trough which provided washing-places for the brethren.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[50](asm066.htm#fr_49.md) It should be remembered
that for the medieval psychologist the term "memory" included all that
we mean by "mind."

<span id="fn_50"></span>[51](asm066.htm#fr_50.md) "The Godhead," says
Dionysius, "is celebrated by religion as One and as Unity, because of
the simplicity and oneness of its supernatural indivisibility. Thereby,
as by a unifying power, we are unified; and, when our various
diversities have been gathered together in a supernatural way, we are
collected into a divine onefoldness and union wherein we are like unto
God." (*Divine Names*, cap. 1.)

<span id="fn_51"></span>[52](asm067.htm#fr_51.md) This wonderful
description of the attributes of God contains many reminiscences of
mystical writers, from St Paul onwards: especially St Augustine,
Dionysius, St Bernard, and Meister Eckhart. Cf. St Augustine,
*Confessions*, bk. 1. caps. 3 and 4, Dionysius the Areopagite, *Divine
Names*, caps. 1 and 7, and *Celestial Hierarchy*, cap. 7, St. Bernard,
*de consideratione*, bk. v. cap. 8, Meister Eckhart, *Predichten.* There
are striking parallels to this and other similar passages in Ruysbroeck
in the *Book of Truth* of his contemporary Suso.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[53](asm078.htm#fr_52.md) The Flemish "welbehagen"
is perhaps more accurately translated "well-being," "comfort" or "good
pleasure." Cf. *The Book of Truth*, cap. 10. The idea intended is the
complete and blissful self-comprehension and self-satisfaction of the
Divine Essence; the "perfect round" which is enringed in love. So Dante

"O luce eterna, che sola in te sidi,  
sola t'intendi, e, da te intelletta  
ed intendente te, ami ed arridi!"  
(Par. xxxiii. 124.)

<span id="fn_53"></span>[54](asm079.htm#fr_53.md) Here again Ruysbroeck and
Dante, both depending upon scholastic conceptions of the Universe, are
in close agreement. Ruysbroeck's "heaven of unmingled radiance" is the
Empyrean "ch' pura luce" (Par. xxx. 39): from this the *Primum Mobile*,
or first revolving heaven, takes and distributes the power by which all
creation is moved.

"E questo cielo non ha altro dove  
che la mente divina, in che s'accende  
l'amor che il volge e la virt ch' ei piove."  
(Par. xxvii. 109.)

<span id="fn_54"></span>[55](asm086.htm#fr_54.md) "Middel en sonder
middel": *i.e.* mediated, through gifts, forms, symbols and conceptual
images; and unmediated, being given as a direct intuitive experience to
the soul in the unity of the spirit.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[56](asm087.htm#fr_55.md) The word is
"levendicheit," really meaning the vital essence of the soul: that
"life-giving life" which Ruysbroeck, following St Bernard, regards as
the link between the soul's essence and the Divine Essence, and the
vivid source of our life in time. Thus for him the spiritual man is a
"levende mensche": more vividly alive than those in whom this germ of
Eternity has not been quickened.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[57](asm087.htm#fr_56.md) Thus Dionysius

"Every essence, power, energy, condition, perception, reason,
conception, contact, knowledge and union—in a word, all things
existing—are from the Beautiful and Good, and in the Beautiful and Good,
and return towards the Beautiful and Good." (*Divine Names*, cap. 4.)

<span id="fn_57"></span>[58](asm088.htm#fr_57.md) This is the scholastic
doctrine of the *lumen gloriae*. *See* Introduction, p. xxv.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[59](asm088.htm#fr_58.md) "Onsinct die gheest hem
selven in ghebrukeliker minnen"—the spirit, as regards its separate
consciousness, drowns and loses itself in the Eternal Love of God. This
immersion, self-mergence, or sinking of the spirit into the One which is
its home, is the "completing opposite" of that other action of grace,
which thrusts the self out with its powers as a free and energetic
instrument of the Divine Will: thus perfecting the soul's dual likeness
to God, in work and in rest. Compare Ch. LXIII, "The Gift of
Understanding."

<span id="fn_59"></span>[60](asm089.htm#fr_59.md) By the "effective
understanding" Ruysbroeck probably meant the faculty, sometimes called
the "higher reason" or "pure intellect" which the Victorine mystics
described as "beyond and beside reason," and whereby the mind
contemplates *intellectibilia*: the "invisible things which may not be
comprehended by human reason." Cf. Richard of St Victor, *Benjamin
Major*, bk. i. caps. 6 and 7.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[61](asm089.htm#fr_60.md) "Ghebrukelike
gheneychtheit." This, one of Ruysbroeck's favourite terms, is generally
translated "inclination"; but really includes the meaning—so
characteristic of his doctrine—of a perceptual willed and active tending
or drawing-nigh of the spirit to the enjoyment and possession of God:
and instinctive effort of the soul to achieve its goal. It is the
tendency immortalised in St Augustine's saying, "Thou hast made us for
Thyself, and our heart can find no rest except in Thee." (*Confessions*,
bk. i. cap. 7.)

<span id="fn_61"></span>[62](asm091.htm#fr_61.md) So Dionysius:
"God-receptive minds, being the images of God, are the Divine abodes
wherein above all God rests." (*Celestial Hierarchy*, cap. 7.)

<span id="fn_62"></span>[63](asm093.htm#fr_62.md) "Smakender wijsheit":
"tasting wisdom." Taste and touch, the most intimate of the bodily
senses, are those most frequently used by Ruysbroeck as images of the
soul's apprehensions of God.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[64](asm095.htm#fr_63.md) This is that
"contemplation *in caligine*" celebrated by all Christian mystics of the
Dionysian tradition. It introduces consciousness into a universe which
seems dark, bare, and nought to the intellect, because it transcends all
the conceptions with which that intellect is able to deal; being indeed
"dark with excess of light." Thus Dionysius says:

"We pray that we may enter the Radiant Darkness, and through blindness
and ignorance may see and know that this blindness and ignorance is
itself above sight and knowledge" (*Mystic Theology*, cap. 1); and
again, "The Divine Dark is the inaccessible Light in which God is said
to dwell. Into this dark, invisible because of its surpassing brightness
and unsearchable because of the abundance of its supernatural torrents
of light, all enter who are deemed worthy to know and see God: and by
the very fact of not seeing or knowing, are truly *in* Him Who is above
all sight and knowledge." (*Letter to Dorothy the Deacon.*)

So, too, the author of *The Cloud of Unknowing*"Let be this everywhere
and this aught, in comparison of this nowhere and this nought. Reck thee
never if thy wits cannot reason of this nought; for surely I love it
much the better. It is so worthy a thing in itself that they cannot
reason thereupon. this nought may better be felt than seen: for it is
full blind and full dark to them that have but little while looked
thereupon. Nevertheless, if I shall soothlier say, a soul is more
blinded in feeling of it for abundance of ghostly light, than for any
darkness or wanting of bodily light."

(*The Cloud of Unknowing*, cap. 68.)

<span id="fn_64"></span>[65](asm095.htm#fr_64.md) The Flemish "inblicke
Gods" suggests the sudden flashing glance of Divine enlightenment: keen,
vivid, but transitory, like lightning in the sky.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[66](asm095.htm#fr_65.md) This conception of the
dual life which man possesses in the likeness of God appears to be
derived from Dionysius, who says:

"That which is established above both every rest and every movement, and
moves each thing according to the law of its own being in its own
movement, is both the Rest and the Movement of all." (*Divine Names*,
cap. 1.)

<span id="fn_66"></span>[67](asm096.htm#fr_66.md) This adherence or
deliberate cleaving of the loving will to God is the supreme work of the
self in the Divine union and is never transcended. Its absence marks the
distinction between heretical quietism and true contemplation.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[68](asm096.htm#fr_67.md) Ruysbroeck's word
"ledich" means both empty and idle: a blank passivity of the mind and of
the will.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[69](asm097.htm#fr_68.md) "God-lidende": *i.e*.
passively suffering God to act in and through them.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[70](asm098.htm#fr_69.md) This entrance of the soul
into the God-seeing life is the equivalent of Dante's entrance into the
Empyrean.

   
". . . noi semo usciti fuore  
del maggior corpo al ciel, ch' pura luce;  
luce intellettual piena d'amore,  
amor di vero ben pien di letizia,  
letizia che trascende ogni dolzore."  
(Par. xxx. 38.)

<span id="fn_70"></span>[71](asm098.htm#fr_70.md) So Dionysius: "The
Beginning and Cause beyond all beginning of every being, grasping all
things superessentially in an irresistible embrace." (*Celestial
Hierarchy*, cap. 7.)

<span id="fn_71"></span>[72](asm098.htm#fr_71.md) "When this takes place,"
says Plotinus, "the soul will see both God and herself, so far as it is
lawful for her to see Him. And she will see herself indeed illumined,
and full of intelligible light; or rather, she will perceive herself to
*be* pure light." (*On the Good, or the One*.)

<span id="fn_72"></span>[73](asm100.htm#fr_72.md) "In levenden redenen,"
perhaps more exactly "in *life-giving* ideas." Surius, in his great
Latin translation renders, this, "sub vividis rationibus." This is one
of the passages in which the Platonic character of Ruysbroeck's doctrine
is specially marked.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[74](asm100.htm#fr_73.md) Suso expresses this
doctrine with even greater daring

"Mark this: in eternity, all creatures are God in God; and there, there
is no fundamental difference between them, save that which we have said.
And in so much as they are in God, they are the same life, the same
being, the same power: they are the same One, and nothing less. (Suso,
*The Book of Truth*, cap. 3.)

<span id="fn_74"></span>[75](asm100.htm#fr_74.md) Thus Dionysius says, "We
should know that our mind has the power of thought, through which it
perceives intellectual things: but the union through which it is brought
into contact with things beyond itself surpasses the nature of the mind.
We must therefore contemplate Divine things by means of this union; not
in ourselves, but by standing out of ourselves with our whole selves and
becoming wholly of God. For it is better to be of God than of
ourselves." (*Divine Names*, cap 7.)

<span id="fn_75"></span>[76](asm101.htm#fr_75.md) Cf. The Twelve Béguines,
cap. 8

"That which is wayless is above reason, not without it,  
And it perceives all things without wonder.  
Wonder is far beneath it,  
And the life of contemplation is without wonder."

<span id="fn_76"></span>[77](asm101.htm#fr_76.md) The last phrases of this
passage are written in the irregular rhymed verse which Ruysbroeck so
often interpolated in his prose writings. It has been found impossible
to give a sufficiently close English rendering of this. I therefore give
the original Flemish as an example of his poetic style

"En dit is in dat wiselose wesen dat age ynnighe gheeste boven alle dinc
hebben vercoren,  
Dit is die donkere stille daer alle minnende in sijn verloren:  
Maer moche wi ons aldus in doghenden ghereden,  
Wi souden ons schiere van den live ontcleden,  
En souden vlieten in wilde zeebaren:  
Nemmermeer en mochte ons creature verhalen."

<span id="fn_77"></span>[78](asm104.htm#fr_77.md) These are the mystical
forms of the Evangelical Counsels of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[79](asm106.htm#fr_78.md) Ruysbroeck wrote, or
dictated, *terdelinc*, literally "tread-ling," probably imagining some
relation between *calculus* (pebble), from *calx* (stone), and *calcare*
(to tread), from *calx* (knuckle, heel).

<span id="fn_79"></span>[80](asm110.htm#fr_79.md) "Een eenformich leven met
Gode draghen." Here Ruysbroeck accepts in the most extreme form possible
to a Catholic Christian the dangerous doctrine of the "deification" of
the soul; its total transformation in God. We must, however, read such
passages in the light thrown upon them by his distinct declarations in
other places concerning the "invincible otherness" of God and the human
spirit. Cf. *infra* cap. 10, where it is shown that this transmutation
within the Divine Essence cannot and does not involve identity. Compare
*The Book of Truth*, cap. 11. So, too, in *The Twelve Béguines*, cap.
14: "The spirit of man doth not become God, but is God-formed, and knows
itself to be breadth and length and height and depth."

<span id="fn_80"></span>[81](asm111.htm#fr_80.md) This "death in God" or
total self-loss in the Divine Abyss was one of the favourite doctrines
of the Friends of God, with whom Ruysbroeck appears to have been closely
connected.

Thus Tauler says

"Everything depends on this: a fathomless sinking into a fathomless
nothingness. . . . The Heavenly Father says, 'Thou shalt call Me Father,
and shalt never cease to enter in; entering ever further, ever nearer,
so as to sink ever deeper into an unknown and unnamed Abyss, and, above
all ways, images and forms, above an powers, to lose thyself, deny
thyself, and even unform thyself.' In this lost state, nothing is seen
but a ground which rests upon itself: everywhere one being, one life.
Thus, man may say, he becomes without knowledge, without love, without
feeling. But this does not come from our natural qualities; but from the
transformation of the created spirit by the Spirit of God, in the
fathomless self-immersion of the created spirit, and its fathomless
resignation." (*Sermon on St Matthew*.)

<span id="fn_81"></span>[82](asm111.htm#fr_81.md) Compare St Augustine

"In this seeing and beholding of Truth, which is the seventh and last
stage of the soul (and not indeed a stage but a habitation to which she
attains by these stages), what shall I say of the joys, of the fruition
of the Supreme and True Good, of the perfect peace and breath of
Eternity. (*De Quantitate Animae*, cap. 33.)

<span id="fn_82"></span>[83](asm113.htm#fr_82.md) This, too, seems to have
an Augustinian source

"I heard Thy voice from on high crying unto me, 'I am the Food of the
full-grown: grow, and thou shalt feed on Me; nor shalt thou change Me
into thine own substance, as thou changest the food of the flesh, but
thou shalt be changed into Mine.'" (*Confessions*, bk. vii. cap. 10.)

<span id="fn_83"></span>[84](asm114.htm#fr_83.md) Ruysbroeck wrote "*bloter
ghedacten*"; probably meaning the simple and undifferentiated
consciousness, above the discursive reason, which is attained in high
contemplative states: the "pure intellect" of Plotinus.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[85](asm114.htm#fr_84.md) "Dat wide onploken
behagene Gods." Compare note 53.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[86](asm122.htm#fr_85.md) It will be seen that this
is another aspect of that balanced life of action and fruition described
in *The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage*, which parallels on the
human plane the essentially static and personally dynamic aspects of the
Divine life. Compare note 66.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[87](asm125.htm#fr_86.md) This ancient simile for
the union of the soul with God is constantly used by Ruysbroeck. It goes
back at least to the fourth century A.D.; being found in the sermons of
St Macarius. Ruysbroeck probably took it from St Bernard (*De diligendo
Deo*, cap. 10), or possibly Richard of St Victor (*De Quatuor Gradibus
Violentae Charitatis*).

<span id="fn_87"></span>[88](asm128.htm#fr_87.md) "Hi gheeft hem in dat
wesen der sielen, dar der sielen crachten, boven redene, gheenvoldicht
sijn en ghedaghen die overforminghen Gods eenvoldigher wijs."

Reason, will and love must here be fused in one simple state, in order
that they may apprehend the Unity in which an wisdom, love and will are
resumed. This doctrine of self-simplification was well understood by the
Platonic mystics and has passed from them into the Christian tradition.
Thus Plotinus says, "The soul must ascend to the principle which is in
herself, and become one instead of many, in order that she may
contemplate the Principle of all things, and the One." (*On the Good, or
the One*.)

<span id="fn_88"></span>[89](asm130.htm#fr_88.md) The Flemish word
"instaerne," which Ruysbroeck here uses, conveys the idea of an absorbed
inward gazing, for which we have no exact expression in English.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[90](asm130.htm#fr_89.md) "Staende in syn abijt."
This phrase has puzzled all translators, from Surius onwards. Taken with
its context, it seems to mean that the self's ascent to the heights of
Divine fruition does not entail any impoverishment of the lower levels
of existence. The senses, the intellect, the normal religious faculty,
each continue to exist "in their own place." This is another statement
of the profound truth insisted upon in *The Sparkling Stone*: that the
completed life of man, like that of its Pattern Christ, is both active
and contemplative, both human and divine"living wholly in God where we
possess our blessedness, and wholly in ourselves where we exercise
ourselves in love to God."
