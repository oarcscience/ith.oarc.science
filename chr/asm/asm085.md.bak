## CHAPTER LV

 

### OF THE FRUITFUL WORKS OF THE SPIRIT, THE WHICH ARE ETERNAL

 

Now our spirit and this love are living and fruitful in virtues; and for
this reason the powers can no longer remain idle in the unity of the
spirit. For the incomprehensible brightness of God and His boundless
love brood above the spirit, and touch the loving power; and the spirit
goes forth once more into its works, but with a more sublime and inward
striving than ever before. And the more noble and inward it is, the more
quickly it is spent and brought to nought in love, and goes forth once
more into fresh works. And this is heavenly love. For ever does the
craving spirit yearn to eat and to swallow God; but itself is swallowed
up in the touch of God, and fails in all its works. For the highest
powers are made one in the unity of the spirit. Here are grace and love
in their essence, above all works; for here is the source of charity and
every virtue. Here there is an eternal outflow into charity and the
virtues, and an eternal return with inward hunger for the taste of God,
and an eternal dwelling within in pure love. And all this is in a
creaturely way and below God; it is the most inward exercise which one
can perform in the created light, in heaven and on earth; and above it
there is nothing but the God-seeing life in the Divine light and in the
Godlike way. In this exercise one cannot go astray, nor can one be
deceived; and it begins in grace, and shall for ever last in glory.
