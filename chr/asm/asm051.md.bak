## CHAPTER XXI

 

### A SIMILITUDE HOW A MAN SHOULD ACT AND BEAR HIMSELF IN THIS CASE

 

Now I will give you a short similitude, that you may not err in this
case, but may govern yourselves prudently. You should watch the wise bee
and do as it does. It dwells in unity, in the congregation of its
fellows, and goes forth, not in the storm, but in calm and still
weather, in the sunshine, towards all those flowers in which sweetness
may be found. It does not rest on any flower, neither on any beauty nor
on any sweetness; but it draws from them honey and wax, that is to say,
sweetness and light-giving matter, and brings both to the unity of the
hive, that therewith it may produce fruits, and be greatly profitable.
Christ, the Eternal Sun, shining into the open heart, causes that heart
to grow and to bloom, and it overflows with all the inward powers with
joy and sweetness.

So the wise man will do like the bee, and he will fly forth with
attention and with reason and with discretion, towards all those gifts
and towards all that sweetness which he has ever experienced, and
towards all the good which God has ever done to him. And in the light of
love and with inward observation, he will taste of the multitude of
consolations and good things; and will not rest upon any flower of the
gifts of God, but, laden with gratitude and praise, will fly back into
the unity, wherein he wishes to rest and to dwell eternally with God.

This is the second degree of that inward working which adorns the lower
part of man in many ways.
