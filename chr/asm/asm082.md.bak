## CHAPTER LII

 

### SHOWING HOW THE SPIRIT GOES OUT THROUGH THE DIVINE STIRRING

 

Now, through this touch, Christ says inwardly within the spirit: Go ye
out with practices in conformity with this touch. For this deep touch
draws and invites our spirit to the most inward practices which a
creature is able to fulfil in a creaturely way in the created light.
Here the spirit raises itself, through the power of love, above all
works, into the unity where this life-giving spring or touch gushes
forth. And this touch invites the understanding to know God in His
brightness, and it draws and invites the power of love to enjoy God
without intermediary. And this the loving spirit desires to do, both in
a natural and a supernatural way, above all other things. By means of
the enlightened reason the spirit lifts itself up in inward observation,
and it beholds and observes the most inward part of itself, where this
touch lives. Here reason and every created light fail and can go no
further. For the Supernal Brightness brooding over all, which gives rise
to this touch, blinds in its coming every created sight; for it is
abysmal. And all understanding in the created light is here like the
eyes of a bat in the light of the sun. Yet the spirit is continually
invited and urged anew by God and by itself to sound and to know that
which is stirring these deeps, and what God is, and what this touch is.
And the enlightened reason ever asks anew, whence this comes, and ever
seeks to explore further, that it may follow back this stream of honey
to its source. But in this it is, on the first day, as wise as it shall
ever be. And this is why reason and all observation say: "I know not
what it is," for the Supernal Brightness brooding over all, strikes back
all understanding and blinds it whenever they meet.

So God abides in His brightness above all spirits who are in heaven and
on earth. And those who have pierced through their ground by means of
the virtues and inward practices, to their source, that is, to the door
of eternal life, may feel this touch. There the Brightness of God shines
so mightily that reason and all understanding fail and can go no
further, but must be overcome and give way before the incomprehensible
Brightness of God. But when the spirit feels this in its ground, then,
though its reason and understanding fail before the Divine Brightness,
and must remain outside the door, the power of love desires to go
forward; for it too, like the understanding, has been invited and urged.
And it is blind and desires fruition; and fruition abides more in
tasting and feeling than in understanding. Therefore would love go
forward, whilst understanding stays outside.
