## CHAPTER II

 

### A SHORT REPETITION OF ALL THE HIGHEST TEACHINGS WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR

 

Behold, I have said this: that the contemplative lover of God is united
with God through means, and also without means, and thirdly, without
difference or distinction; and this I find in nature, and in grace, and
also in glory. Further I have said that never creature may be or become
so holy that it loses its created being and becomes God; even the soul
of our Lord Jesus Christ shall ever remain creature, and other than God.
Yet, none the less, we must all be lifted up above ourselves into God,
and become one spirit with God in love; and then we shall be blessed.
And therefore mark my words and my meaning, and understand me aright as
to what is the condition and the way to our eternal blessedness.
