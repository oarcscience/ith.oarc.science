## CHAPTER XXXV

 

### OF THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST, OR, THE FOUNTAIN WITH THREE RILLS

 

Now we will speak further of the second manner of the coming of Christ,
in those inward exercises by which a man is adorned, enlightened, and
enriched in the three highest powers of the soul. This coming we will
liken to a living fountain with three rills. <span

The fountain-head, from which the rills flow forth, is the fulness of
Divine grace within the unity of our spirit. There grace dwells
essentially; abiding as a brimming fountain, and actively flowing forth
in rills into all the powers of the soul, each according to its need.
These rills are special inflowings or workings of God in the higher
powers, wherein God works by means of grace in many diverse ways.
