## CHAPTER LXI

 

### OF HOW GOD AND OUR SPIRIT VISIT EACH OTHER IN THE UNITY AND IN THE LIKENESS

 

Now God sees the dwelling and the resting-place which He has made within
us and through us; namely, the unity and the likeness. <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](asm132.htm#fn_61) And He wills to visit this
unity without interruption, with a new coming of His most high birth and
with a rich pouring forth of his fathomless love; for He wills to dwell
in bliss within the loving spirit. And He wills to visit the likeness of
our spirit with rich gifts, so that we become more like unto Him and
more enlightened in the virtues. Now it is Christ's will that we should
dwell and abide within the essential unity of our spirit, rich with Him
above all creaturely works and above all virtues; and that we should
dwell actively in that same unity, rich and fulfilled with virtues and
heavenly gifts. And He wills that we shall visit that unity and that
likeness without interruption, by means of every work which we do: for
in every new "Now," God is born in us, and from this most high birth the
Holy Ghost flows forth with all His gifts. Therefore we should go out to
meet the gifts of God through the likeness; and the most high birth,
through the unity.
