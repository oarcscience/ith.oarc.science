## CHAPTER IX

 

### SHOWING WHAT CHRIST WILL DO IN THE DAY OF DOOM

 

In this Judgment Christ, our Bridegroom and our Judge, will reward and
punish, according to justice; for He will give every man that which he
has earned. He will give to the good, for every good work done in God, a
wage without measure, that is to say, God's very Self, Whom no creature
of itself can earn. But when God works these works with and through the
creature, then by His power the creature gains His very Self as wage.
And with due justice He will give eternal woe and eternal sorrow to the
damned; for these despised and rejected the Eternal Good for a good that
cannot endure. And of their own free will they have turned away from
God, and have set themselves against His glory and His will, and have
sought after creatures; and so shall they be justly condemned.

Those who bear witness at the Judgment are the angels and the conscience
of men. And the adversary is the hellish fiend; and the Judge is Christ,
Whom none can deceive.
