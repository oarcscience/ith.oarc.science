## CHAPTER XXVI

 

### ANOTHER EXAMPLE

 

And now I will warn you against another thing which may cause great
harm. Sometimes in that hot season there falls the honey-dew of a
certain false sweetness, which pollutes the fruit, or utterly spoils it.
And it is most apt to fall at noon, in bright sunshine, and in big
drops; and it is hardly to be distinguished from rain. So likewise, some
men may be robbed of their outward senses by a certain light produced by
the devil. And in this light they are enwrapped and ensnared, and at the
same time many kinds of images, both false and true, are shown to them,
and they are spoken to in diverse ways; and all this is seen and
received of them with great delight. And here there fall sometimes the
honey-drops of a false sweetness, in which a man may find his pleasure.
He who esteems it much receives much of it: and thereby the man is
easily polluted, for if he will hold for true those things which are not
like to truth, for the reason that they have been shown or spoken to
him, he falls into error and the fruit of virtue is lost. But those who
have trodden the ways whereof I have written before, though they may be
tempted by this spirit and this light, they will recognise them and will
not be harmed.
