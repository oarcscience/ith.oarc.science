## CHAPTER XLVIII

 

### OF THE UNITY OF THE DIVINE NATURE IN THE TRINITY OF THE PERSONS

 

The most high and superessential Unity of the Divine Nature, where the
Father and the Son possess Their nature in the unity of the Holy
Ghost—above the comprehension and understanding of all our powers, in
the naked being of our spirit—is a supernal stillness, wherein God
broods above all creatures in the created light. This most high Unity of
the Divine Nature is living and fruitful; for, out of this same Unity,
the Eternal Word is incessantly born of the Father. And, through this
birth, the Father knows the Son; and, in the Son, all things. And the
Son knows the Father; and all things in the Father. For they are one
Simple Nature. From this mutual contemplation of the Father and the Son,
in the eternal radiance, there flow forth an eternal content <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](asm132.htm#fn_52) and a fathomless love, and that
is the Holy Ghost. And through the Holy Ghost, and through the Eternal
Wisdom, God inclines Himself towards each creature in particular, and
lovingly endows and enkindles each one, according to its worth and the
state into which it has been put and to which it has been destined by
its virtues and by the Eternal Providence of God. And thereby all good
spirits, in heaven and on earth, are moved to virtue and righteousness.
