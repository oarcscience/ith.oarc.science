## CHAPTER LVI

 

### SHOWING THE WAY IN WHICH WE SHALL MEET GOD IN A GHOSTLY MANNER BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT MEANS <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](asm132.htm#fn_54.md)

 

Now I have shown you how the free and uplifted man becomes, through the
grace of God, seeing in his inward practices. And we see that this is
the first point which Christ demands and desires of us where He says:
Behold. As to the second and third points, wherein He says: The
Bridegroom cometh, and: Go ye out, I have shown you the three ways of
the inward coming of Christ; and further that the first coming has four
degrees, and how we are to go out with practices answering to each way
in which God inwardly enkindles, teaches, and moves us. Now we must
consider the fourth point, which is the last. This is the meeting with
Christ our Bridegroom. For all our inward and ghostly vision, in grace
or in glory, and all our going out in the virtues, in whatsoever
practices this be done, it is all for the sake of a meeting and a union
with Christ our Bridegroom: for He is our eternal rest and the end and
wage of all our labour.

You know that every meeting is a coming together of two persons, who
come from different places, which are separated from, and opposite to,
each other. Now Christ comes from above as a Lord and generous Giver,
who can do all things. And we come from below as the poor servants, who
can do nothing of ourselves, but have need of everything. The coming of
Christ to us is from within outwards, and we go towards Him from without
inwards; and this is why a ghostly meeting must here take place. And
this coming and this meeting of ourselves and Christ takes place in two
ways, to wit, with means and without means.
