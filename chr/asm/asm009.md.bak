## CHAPTER VI

 

### OF THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST

 

The second coming of Christ our Bridegroom takes place every day within
good men; often and many times, with new graces and gifts, in all those
who make themselves ready for it, each according to his power. We would
not speak here of a man's first conversion, nor of the first grace which
was given to him when he turned from sin to the virtues. But we would
speak of an increase of new gifts and new virtues from day to day, and
of the present coming of Christ our Bridegroom which takes place daily
within our souls.

Now we must consider the why and the wherefore, the way and the working
of this coming. Its wherefore is fourfold: God's mercy and our
destitution, God's generosity and our desire. These four things cause
the growth of virtue and of nobleness.

Now understand this: when the sun sends its beams and its radiance into
a deep valley between two high mountains, and, standing in the zenith,
can yet shine upon the bottom and ground of the valley, then three
things happen: the valley becomes full of light by reflection from the
mountains, and it receives more heat, and becomes more fruitful, than
the plain and level country. And so likewise, when a good man takes his
stand upon his own littleness, in the most lowly part of himself, and
confesses and knows that he has nothing, and is nothing, and can
nothing, of himself, neither stand still nor go on, and when he sees how
often he fails in virtues and good works: then he confesses his poverty
and his helplessness, then he makes a valley of humility. And when he is
thus humble, and needy, and knows his own need; he lays his distress,
and complains of it, before the bounty and the mercy of God. And so he
marks the sublimity of God and his own lowliness; and thus he becomes a
deep valley. And Christ is a Sun of righteousness and also of mercy, Who
stands in the highest part of the firmament, that is, on the right hand
of the Father, and from thence He shines into the bottom of the humble
heart; for Christ is always moved by helplessness, whenever a man
complains of it and lays it before Him with humility. Then there arise
two mountains, that is, two desires; one to serve God and praise Him
with reverence, the other to attain noble virtues. Those two mountains
are higher than the heavens, for these longings touch God without
intermediary, and crave His ungrudging generosity. And then that
generosity cannot withhold itself, it must flow forth; for then the soul
is made ready to receive, and to hold, more gifts.

These are the wherefore, and the way of the new coming with new virtues.
Then, this valley, the humble heart, receives three things: it becomes
more radiant and enlightened by grace, it becomes more ardent in
charity, and it becomes more fruitful in perfect virtues and in good
works. And thus you have the why, the way, and the work of this coming.
