## CHAPTER XVI

 

### ANOTHER SIMILITUDE CONCERNING THE SAME EXERCISE

 

When summer draws near and the sun rises higher, it draws the moisture
out of the earth through the roots, and through the trunks of the trees,
into the twigs; and hence come foliage, flower, and fruit.

So likewise, when Christ the Eternal Sun rises and ascends in our
hearts, so that it is summer in the adornment of our virtues, He gives
His light and His heat to our desires, and draws the heart from all the
multiplicity of earthly things, and brings about unity and inwardness;
and makes the heart grow and bring forth the leaves of inward love, the
flowers of ardent devotion, and the fruits of thanksgiving and praise,
and makes these fruits to endure eternally, in humble grief, because of
our shortcomings.

Here ends the first of the four chief degrees of that inward working
whereby the lowest part of man is adorned.
