## CHAPTER VII

 

### OF THE THIRD COMING OF OUR LORD

 

The third way in which our Lord comes inwardly is by an inward stirring
or touch in the unity of the spirit, wherein are the higher powers of
the soul; wherefrom they flow forth, and to which they return again, and
with which they always remain united in the bonds of love and through
the natural unity of the spirit. In this coming consists the highest and
most interior condition of the inward life; and by it the unity of the
spirit is adorned in many ways.

Now, in each coming, Christ desires of us a special going out of
ourselves, toward a life that shall accord with the way of His coming.
And therefore He says in ghostly wise within our hearts at each coming:
Go ye out in your lives and in your practices in the way in which My
graces and My gifts shall urge you. For according to the manner and way
in which the Spirit of God urges, and drives, and draws, and streams
into us, and stirs us; in this way we must go out and progress in our
inward practices, if we are to become perfect. But if we withstand the
Spirit of God by a life that does not accord with it, we lose that
inward urge, and then the virtues will depart from us.

These are the three comings of Christ, in inward exercises. We will now
explain and set forth each coming separately. Attend therefore with
diligence; for he who never has himself felt or experienced this he
shall not easily understand it.
