## CHAPTER IX

 

### OF UNITY OF HEART

 

Of this ardour there springs unity of heart; for we cannot achieve true
unity unless the Spirit of God blows to a flame His fire in our hearts.
For this fire makes one with itself and like to itself all that it can
master and re-shape.

Unity is this: that a man feel himself to be gathered together with all
his powers in the unity of his heart. Unity brings inward peace and
restfulness of heart. Unity of heart is a bond which draws together body
and soul, heart and senses, and all the outward and inward powers and
encloses them in the union of love.
