## CHAPTER LVII

 

### OF THE ESSENTIAL MEETING WITH GOD WITHOUT MEANS IN THE NAKEDNESS OF OUR NATURE

 

Now understand and mark this well. The unity of our spirit has two
conditions: it is essential, and it is active. You must know that the
spirit, according to its essence, receives the coming of Christ in the
nakedness of its nature, without means and without interruption. For the
being and the life which we are in God, in our Eternal Image, and which
we have within ourselves according to our essence, this is without means
and indivisible. And this is why the spirit, in its inmost and highest
part, that is in its naked nature, receives without interruption the
impress of its Eternal Archetype, and the Divine Brightness; and is an
eternal dwelling-place of God in which God dwells as an eternal
Presence, and which He visits perpetually, with new comings and with new
instreamings of the ever-renewed brightness of His eternal birth. For
where He comes, there He is; and where He is, there He comes. And where
He has never been, thereto He shall never come; for neither chance nor
change are in Him. And everything in which He is, is in Him; for He
never goes out of Himself. And this is why the spirit in its essence
possesses God in the nakedness of its nature, as God does the spirit:
for it lives in God and God in it. And it is able, in its highest part,
to receive, without intermediary, the Brightness of God, and all that
God can fulfil. And by means of the brightness of its Eternal Archetype,
which shines in it essentially and personally, the spirit plunges itself
and loses itself, as regards the highest part of its life, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](asm132.htm#fn_55.md) in the Divine Being, and there
abidingly possesses its eternal blessedness; and it flows forth again,
through the eternal birth of the Son, together with all the other
creatures, and is set in its created being by the free will of the Holy
Trinity. And here it is like unto the image of the most high Trinity in
Unity, in which it has been made. And, in its created being, it
incessantly receives the impress of its Eternal Archetype, like a
flawless mirror, in which the image remains steadfast, and in which the
reflection is renewed without interruption by its ever-new reception in
new light. This essential union of our spirit with God does not exist in
itself, but it dwells in God, and it flows forth from God, and it
depends upon God, and it returns to God as to its Eternal Origin. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](asm132.htm#fn_56.md) And in this wise it has never
been, nor ever shall be, separated from God; for this union is within us
by our naked nature, and, were this nature to be separated from God, it
would fall into pure nothingness. And this union is above time and
space, and is always and incessantly active according to the way of God.
But our nature, forasmuch as it is indeed like unto God but in itself is
creature. receives the impress of its Eternal Image passively. This is
that nobleness which we possess by nature in the essential unity of our
spirit, where it is united with God according to nature. This neither
makes us holy nor blessed, for all men, whether good or evil, possess it
within themselves; but it is certainly the first cause of all holiness
and all blessedness. This is the meeting and the union between God and
our spirit in the nakedness of our nature.
