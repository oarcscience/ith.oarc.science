## CHAPTER LVIII

 

### SHOWING HOW ONE IS LIKE UNTO GOD THROUGH GRACE AND UNLIKE UNTO GOD THROUGH MORTAL SIN

 

Now consider this thought earnestly; for if you understand well that
which I will now tell you, and that which I have told you, you will have
understood all the Divine truth which any creature can teach you, and
far more besides. Otherwise does our spirit keep itself in that same
unity when it is conceived as acting or working: for then it exists in
itself as in its created and personal being. This is the source of the
higher powers, and here there are beginning and end of all the
creaturely works which are worked in a creaturely way, both in nature
and above nature. Yet here the unity does not work forasmuch as it is
unity; but all the powers of the soul, in what way soever they work,
derive their strength and their power from their proper source, that is,
from the unity of the spirit, where it dwells in its personal being.

In this unity, the spirit must always either be like unto God through
grace and virtue, or unlike unto God through mortal sin. For, that man
has been made after the likeness of God, means that he has been created
in the grace of God; the which grace is a God-formed light, which shines
through us and makes us like to God; and without this light, which makes
us God-like, we cannot be united with God supernaturally, even though we
cannot lose the image of God nor our natural unity with Him <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](asm132.htm#fn_57.md). If we lose the likeness, that
is, the grace of God, we are damned. And therefore, whenever God finds
within us some capacity for the reception of His grace, it is His
pleasure and His free goodness to make us through His gifts, full of
life, and like unto Him. This always happens whenever we turn to Him
with our whole will; for at that very moment, Christ comes to us and in
us, both with means and without means, that is, with the virtues and
above the virtues. And He impresses His image and His likeness in us,
namely Himself and His gifts: and He redeems us from sin, and makes us
free and like unto Himself. And in that same working, through which God
redeems us from sins, and makes us free and like unto Him through
charity, the spirit immerses itself in fruitive love <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](asm132.htm#fn_58.md). And here there take place a
meeting and a union which are without means and above nature, and
wherein our highest blessedness consists. Although all that He gives us
from love and free goodness is natural to God, for us, according to our
condition, it is accidental and supernatural. For before, we were
strangers and unlike unto God; and afterwards, becoming like Him, have
received union with God.
