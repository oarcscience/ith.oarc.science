## CHAPTER XXXIX

 

### SHOWING HOW THE ESTABLISHED MAN SHALL GO OUT IN FOUR WAYS

 

Now the man who is established in the bonds of love shall dwell in the
unity of the spirit; and he shall go out with enlightened reason and
with overflowing love in heaven and on earth; and he shall mark all
things with clear discernment; and he shall dispense and distribute all
things, out of true generosity, and because of his richness in God.

In four ways this enlightened man is invited and urged to go out. The
first going out shall be towards God and towards all saints; the second
going out shall be towards sinners and towards all perverted men; the
third going out shall be towards purgatory; and the fourth, towards
himself and towards all good men.
