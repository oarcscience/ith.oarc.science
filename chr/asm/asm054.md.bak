## CHAPTER XXIV

###  

### OF ECSTACIES AND DIVINE REVELATIONS

###  

By this fierce ardour and this impatience some men are at times caught
into the spirit, above the senses; and there words are spoken to them
and images and similitudes shown to them, teaching them some truth of
which they or other men have need, or else things that are to come.
These are called revelations or visions. If they are bodily images, they
are received in the imagination. This may be the work of an angel in
man, through the power of God. If it be an intellectual truth, or a
ghostly image, through which God reveals Himself in His
unfathomableness, this is received in the understanding; and the man can
clothe it in words in so far as it can be expressed in words. Sometimes
a man may also be drawn above himself and above the spirit (but not
altogether outside himself) into an Incomprehensible Good, which he
shall never be able either to utter or to explain in the way in which he
heard and saw; for in this simple act and this simple vision, to hear
and to see are one. And none can work this in man, without intermediary
and without the co-operation of any creature, save God alone. It is
called Raptus; which means, rapt away, or uplifted, or carried away. At
times God grants to such men a sudden spiritual glimpse, like the
lightning in the sky. It comes like a sudden glimpse of strange
brightness, shining forth from the Simple Nudity. And thereby for an
instant the spirit is raised above itself; but the light passes at once
and the man returns to himself again. This is the work of God Himself;
it is something very sublime; for those to whom it happens often become
illuminated men.

Other things sometimes happen to those who live in the fierce ardour of
love; for often another light shines into them, and this is the work of
God through means. In this light the heart and the desirous powers
uplift themselves towards that light; and, in the meeting with that
light, the joy and the satisfaction are so great that the heart cannot
contain them, but breaks out in a loud voice with cries of joy. And this
is called the Jubilus, or jubilation; that is, a joy which cannot be
uttered in words. <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](asm132.htm#fn_45.md) And one
cannot contain oneself; but if one would go out with an opened and
uplifted heart to meet this light the voice must follow, so long as this
exercise and this light endure. Some inward men are at times taught in a
dream by their guardian angels or by other angels, concerning many
things of which they have need. Some men too are found who have many
sudden intuitions, or inspirations, or imaginations, and also have
miraculous dreams, and yet remain in their outward senses. But these
know nothing of the tumult of love; for they dwell in outward
multiplicity, and love has not wounded them. These things may be
natural, or they may come from the devil, or from good angels, and
therefore we may have faith in them so far as they accord with Holy
Writ, and with the truth, but no more. If we trust them beyond this, we
may easily be deceived. <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](asm132.htm#fn_46.md)
