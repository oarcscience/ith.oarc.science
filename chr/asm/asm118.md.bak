## CHAPTER I

 

### WHEREFORE THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN

 

Certain of my friends have desired and besought me, that I should show
and make plain in a few words and according to my best cunning, shortly
and clearly, how I understand and feel the truth of all the highest
teachings that I have written before; so that none should take offense
at my words, but everyone should profit by them. And this I willingly
consent to do. I will, with God's help, teach the humble who love virtue
and truth; and, with the same words, I shall inwardly vex and darken the
false and the proud: for to these my words will be displeasing and
contrary, and this the proud cannot endure, but it provokes them to
anger.
