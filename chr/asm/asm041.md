## CHAPTER XI

 

### OF SENSIBLE LOVE

 

From inwardness there springs a sensible love, which fulfills the man's
heart and the desirous power of the soul. This yearning love, and this
sensible fruition of the heart, none can have save he who is inward of
heart.

Sensible love is a yearning and savouring delight which we feel in God
as the eternal Good, wherein are all other goods. Sensible love forsakes
all creatures as regards pleasure, not as regards need. Inward love
feels itself moved from within by the Eternal Love; and this it must
ever cherish. Inward love easily foregoes and despises all things that
it may obtain that which it loves.
