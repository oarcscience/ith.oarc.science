## CHAPTER II

 

### HOW THE ETERNAL BIRTH OF GOD IS RENEWED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION IN THE NOBILITY OF THE SPIRIT

 

When we have thus become seeing, we can behold in joy the eternal coming
of our Bridegroom; and that is the second point of which we would speak.
What is this coming of our Bridegroom which is eternal? It is the new
birth and a new enlightenment without interruption; for the ground from
which the Light shines forth, and which is the Light itself, is
life-giving and fruitful, and therefore the manifestation of the Eternal
Light is renewed without ceasing in the hiddenness of the spirit.
Behold, every creaturely work, and every exercise of virtue, must here
cease; for here God works alone in the high nobility of the spirit. And
here there is nothing but an eternal seeing and staring at that Light,
by that Light, and in that Light. And the coming of the Bridegroom is so
swift that He is perpetually coming, and yet dwelling within with
unfathomable riches; and ever coming anew, in His Person, without
interruption, with such new brightness that it seems as though he had
never come before. For His coming consists, beyond time, in an eternal
Now, which is ever received with new longings and new joy. Behold, the
delight and the joy which this Bridegroom brings with Him in His coming
are boundless and without measure, for they are Himself. And this is why
the eyes with which the spirit sees and gazes at its Bridegroom, have
opened so wide that they can never close again. For the spirit continues
for ever to see and to stare at the secret manifestation of God. And the
grasp of the spirit is opened so wide for the coming in of the
Bridegroom, that the spirit itself becomes that Breadth Which it grasps.
And so God is grasped and beheld through God; wherein rests all our
blessedness. This is the second point: in which we receive, without
interruption, the eternal coming of our Bridegroom in our spirit.
