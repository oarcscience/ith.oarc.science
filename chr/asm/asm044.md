## CHAPTER XIV

 

### OF TWO GRIEFS WHICH ARISE FROM INWARD GRATITUDE

 

From inward gratitude and praise there arises a two fold grief of the
heart and torment of desire. The first grief is, that we feel ourselves
to lag behind in thanking, praising, glorifying and serving God. The
second is, that we do not grow in charity, in virtue, in faith, and in
perfect behaviour as much as we desire, that we may become worthy to
thank and praise and serve God as it is proper to do. This is the second
grief. These two are root and fruit, beginning and end, of all inward
virtues.

Inward grief and pain for our shortcomings in virtue and the praise of
God, is the highest effect of this first degree of the inward exercise;
and by it this degree is perfectly achieved.
