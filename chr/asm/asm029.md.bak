## CHAPTER XXVI

###  

### OF THE DESIRE TO KNOW THE BRIDEGROOM IN HIS NATURE

###  

A Man who lives this life in its perfection, as it has here been shown,
and who is offering up his whole life, and all his works, to the worship
and praise of God, and who wills and loves God above all things, is
often stirred by a desire to see, to know, and to prove what, in
Himself, this Bridegroom Christ is; Who for man's sake became man and
laboured in love unto death, and delivered us from sin and the devil,
and has given us Himself and His grace, and left us His sacraments, and
has promised us His kingdom and Himself as an eternal wage; Who also
gives us all that is needful for the body, and inward consolation and
sweetness, and innumerable gifts of all kinds, according to the needs of
each.

When a man beholds all this, he feels an unmeasured impulse to see
Christ his Bridegroom, and to know Him as He is in Himself. Though he
knows Him in His works, this does not seem to him enough. Then he must
do as the publican Zaccheus did, who longed to see Jesus, who He was. He
must run before the crowd, that is the multiplicity of creatures; for
these make us so little and so low that we cannot see God. And he must
climb up into the tree of faith, which grows from above downwards, for
its roots are in the Godhead. This tree has twelve branches, which are
the twelve articles of faith. The lower speak of the Divine Humanity,
and of those things which belong to our salvation of soul and of body.
The upper part of the tree tells of the Godhead, of the Trinity of
Persons, and of the Unity of the Nature of God. And the man must cling
to that unity, in the highest part of the tree; for there it is that
Jesus must pass with all His gifts.

Here comes Jesus, and sees the man, and shows to him, in the light of
faith, that He is according to His Godhead immeasurable and
incomprehensible and inaccessible and abysmal, transcending every
created light and every finite conception. And this is the highest
knowledge of God which any man may have in the active life: that he
should confess in this light of faith that God is incomprehensible and
unknowable. And in this light Christ says to man's desire: Make haste
and come down, for to-day I must abide at thy house. This hasty descent,
to which he is summoned by God, is nothing else than a descent through
desire and through love into the abyss of the Godhead, which no
intelligence can reach in the created light. But where intelligence
remains without, desire and love go in. When the soul is thus stretched
towards God, by intention and by love, above everything that it can
understand, then it rests and dwells in God, and God in it. When the
soul climbs with desire above the multiplicity of creatures, and above
the works of the senses, and above the light of nature, then it meets
Christ in the light of faith, and becomes enlightened, and confesses
that God is unknowable and incomprehensible. When it stretches itself
with longing towards this incomprehensible God, then it meets Christ,
and is filled with His gifts. And when it loves and rests above all
gifts, and above itself, and above all creatures, then it dwells in God,
and God dwells in it.

This is the way in which we shall meet Christ on the summit of the
active life. When you have laid the foundation of righteousness,
charity, and humility; and have established on it a dwelling-place, that
is, those virtues which have been named heretofore; and have met Christ
through faith, by intention and by love; then you dwell in God and God
dwells in you, and you possess the true active life.

And this was the first of which we would speak.
