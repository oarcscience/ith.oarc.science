<p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">OF THE PURE DELIGHT OF THE HEART AND THE SENSIBLE POWERS</h3>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>From this sweetness there springs a well-being of the heart and of all the bodily powers, so that a man thinks himself to be inwardly enfolded in the divine embrace of love. This delight and this consolation are greater and more pleasant to the soul and the body than all the satisfactions of the earth, even though one man should enjoy them all together. In this well-being God sinks into the heart by means of His gifts; with so much savoury solace and joy that the heart overflows from within. This makes a man comprehend the misery of those who live outside love. This well-being melts the heart to such a degree, that the man cannot contain himself through the fulness of inward joy.</p>
