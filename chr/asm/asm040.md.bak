## CHAPTER X

 

### OF INWARDNESS

 

From this unity springs inwardness; for none can be inward save him who
is gathered together in unity within himself. Inwardness means that a
man is turned within, into his own heart, that thereby he may understand
and feel the interior workings, and the interior words of God.
Inwardness is a sensible fire of love, which the Spirit of God has blown
to a flame, and which urges a man from within; and he knows not whence
it comes nor what has befallen him.
