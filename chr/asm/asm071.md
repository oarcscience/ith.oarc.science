## CHAPTER XLI

 

###  

 

At times this same man shall descend towards sinners, with great
compassion, and with generous mercy, and shall bring them before God
with fervent devotion and with much prayer; bringing to God's
remembrance all the good which He is, and all His power, and all that He
has done for us, and has promised us, right as though He had forgotten
all this: for God wills that we beseech Him. And charity shall obtain
all that it desires; nevertheless it must not be stubborn and
self-willed, but must leave all to the rich goodness and to the
generosity of God: for God loves without measure, and herein the lover
best finds his peace. Now, since this man bears a common love to all, he
prays and beseeches God that His love and His mercy may flow forth
towards Pagans and towards Jews and towards all unbelievers, that He may
be loved and known and praised in heaven, and that our glory, our joy
and our peace may spread to all the ends of the earth.

This is the second going out, towards sinners.
