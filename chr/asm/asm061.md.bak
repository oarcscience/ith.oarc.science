## CHAPTER XXXI

 

### OF ANOTHER HINDRANCE

 

If a man thus falls into sickness and cold, he is sometimes caught by
dropsy, that is to say, he has an inclination towards the outward
possession of earthly things. The more such men acquire, the more they
desire; for they straightway become dropsical. The belly, that is, the
appetites or lusts, swells terribly, and the thirst will not be
quenched. But the face of conscience and discretion becomes small and
thin, for these men put hindrances against the inflow of the grace of
God. If they thus accumulate the waters of earthly possessions about the
heart, that is, if they cling to them with desire, they cannot progress
in works of charity; for they are sick, they lack the inward spirit of
life and breath, that is to say, they lack the grace of God and inward
charity. And therefore they cannot rid themselves of the waters of
earthly riches: the heart is submerged in them, and they are often
choked therein and die an eternal death. But those who keep the waters
of earthly riches far below the heart, so that they are master of their
possessions and can renounce them whenever it is needful: these, though
they may suffer long from inordinate inclinations, may yet be cured.
