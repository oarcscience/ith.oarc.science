## CHAPTER X

###  

### OF THE FIVE KINDS OF MEN WHO SHALL APPEAR AT THE JUDGMENT

 

Five kinds of men shall appear before this Judge.

The first, and the worst, are those Christians who have died in mortal
sin, without repentance and without regret; for these have despised the
death of Christ and His sacraments, or else they have received them
unworthily and in vain. And they have not practised the works of mercy,
showing charity toward their neighbours, as God has commanded. And for
this they are doomed to the depths of hell.

The second kind are the unbelievers, Pagans and Jews. These must all
appear before Christ, though they were damned already during their
lives; for, in their time, they possessed neither Divine grace nor
Divine love, and for this reason they have always dwelt in the eternal
death of damnation. But these shall have less pain than the evil
Christians; for, since they received fewer gifts of God, they owed Him
less loyalty.

The third kind are those good Christians who, from time to time, fell
into sin, and rose again through contrition and penance; but who have
not made full satisfaction for their sins according to justice. These
belong to purgatory.

The fourth kind consists of those men who have kept God's commandments;
or, when they broke them, they have returned to God with contrition and
with penance, and with works of charity and mercy and so have made
satisfaction; so that their souls coming forth from their mouths go
straight to heaven, without passing through purgatory.

The fifth kind are all those who, above all outward works of charity,
have their sojourn in heaven, and are noughted and lost in God, and God
in them, so that there is no other thing between God and them but time
and their mortal nature. When these men are made free from their bodies,
they enjoy, in that very moment, eternal bliss; and they are not judged,
but shall themselves judge other men, with Christ, in the Day of Doom.
And then all mortal life, and all temporal sorrows, both on earth and in
purgatory, shall end, and all the souls of the damned, together with the
Fiend and his companions, shall sink and disappear in the deeps of hell,
in a corruption and everlasting horror without end. And in the twinkling
of an eye the blessed shall be with Christ their Bridegroom in eternal
glory; and they shall see and taste and enjoy the fathomless riches of
the Being of God, eternally and for ever.

This is the third coming, which all of us await, and which is still to
happen. The first coming, when God became man and lived in humility
among us, and died for the love of us, this coming we should imitate,
outwardly by fulfilling the perfect moral virtues, inwardly by the
practice of charity and true humility. In the second coming, which
happens in the present time, He comes with grace within each loving
heart; and this coming we should long for and pray for every day, that
we may remain steadfast and grow in new virtues. The third coming, at
the Judgment, or in the hour of death, we should expect with longing,
with trust, and with awe; that we may be set free from this misery and
enter into the house of glory.

This coming in its three ways is the second point of the four chief
points, wherein Christ says: *Sponsus venit*, The Bridegroom cometh.
