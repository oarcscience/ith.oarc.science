## CHAPTER XVII

 

### OF THE SECOND DEGREE OF OUR INWARD EXERCISE, WHICH INCREASES INWARDNESS BY HUMILITY

 

But, having likened the four degrees of the first coming of Christ to
the splendour and the power of the sun, we also find in the sun another
power and another action, which hastens the ripening, and increases the
numbers, of the fruit.

When the sun rises very high, and enters the sign of *Gemini* (that is,
the Twins; or a twofold thing of one nature), which happens in the
middle of the month of May: then it has a double power over flowers and
herbs and everything that grows out of the earth. If, then, the planets
which govern nature are well ordered according to the need of the
season, the sun shines upon the earth and draws the moisture into the
air. Thence come dew and rain; and the fruits increase and multiply.

So likewise, when Christ that bright Sun has risen in our hearts above
all things; when the demands of our bodily nature which are opposed to
the spirit have been curbed and discreetly set in order; when we have
achieved the virtues in the way of which you have heard in the first
degree; when, lastly, through the ardour of our charity, all the
pleasure, and all the peace, which we experience in these virtues, have
been offered up and devoted to God, with thanksgiving and praise:then,
of all this there may come down a sweet rain of new inward consolation
and the heavenly dew of the sweetness of God. This makes the virtues
grow, and multiplies them twofold if we hinder it not. This is a new and
special working, and a new coming, of Christ into the loving heart. And
by it a man is lifted up into a higher state than that in which he was
before. On this height Christ says: Go ye out according to the way of
this coming.
