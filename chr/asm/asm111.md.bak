## CHAPTER IX

 

### HOW WE MAY BECOME HIDDEN SONS OF GOD, AND ATTAIN TO THE GOD-SEEING LIFE

 

But I still longed to know how we may become hidden sons of God, and may
attain to the God-seeing life. And as to this I have apprehended the
following. As it has been said before, we must always live and be
watchful in all virtues, and beyond all virtues must forsake this life
and die in God; for we must die to sin and be born of God into a life of
virtue, and we must renounce ourselves and die in God into an eternal
life. And as to this ensues the following instruction:

If we are born of the Spirit of God, we are the sons of grace; and so
our whole life is adorned with virtues. Thereby we overcome all that is
contrary to God; for St John says, Whatsoever is born of God overcometh
the world. In this birth all good men are sons of God. And the Spirit of
God kindles and stirs each one of them in particular to those virtues
and to those good works for which he is in readiness and of which he is
capable. And so they please God all in common, and each in particular,
according to the measure of his love and the nobleness of his exercise;
nevertheless, they do not feel established nor possessed of God, nor
assured of eternal life, for they may still turn away and fall into sin.
And that is why I call them rather servants and friends, than sons. But
when we transcend ourselves, and become in our ascent towards God, so
simple that the naked love in the height can lay hold of us, where love
enfolds love, above every exercise of virtuethat is, in our Origin, of
Which we are spiritually bornthen we cease, and we and all our selfhood
die in God. And in this death we become hidden sons of God, and find a
new life within us: and that is eternal life And of these sons, St Paul
says: You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. <span

Now understand, the explanation of this is as follows. In our approach
to God, we must carry with us ourselves and all our works, as a
perpetual sacrifice to God; and in the Presence of God, we must forsake
ourselves and all our works, and, dying in love, go forth from all
creatureliness into the superessential richness of God: there we shall
possess God in an eternal death to ourselves. And that is why the Spirit
of God says in the book of the Divine Secrets: Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord. Justly He calls them the blessed dead, for they
remain eternally dead and lost to themselves in the fruitive Unity of
God. And they die in love ever anew, through the indrawing
transformation of that same Unity. Further, the Spirit of God says: They
may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them. In the
ordinary state of grace, when we are born of God into a ghostly and
virtuous life, we carry our works before us, as an offering to God; but
in the wayless state, where we die back into God in an eternal and
blessed life, there our good works follow us, for they are one life with
us. When we go towards God by means of the virtues, God dwells in us;
but when we go out from ourselves and from all else, then we dwell in
God. So soon as we have faith, hope and charity, we have received God,
and He dwells in us with His grace, and He sends us out as His faithful
servants, to keep His commandments. And He calls us in again as His
secret friends, so soon as we are willing to follow His counsels; and He
names us openly as His sons so soon as we live in opposition to the
world. But if above all things we would taste God, and feel eternal life
in ourselves, we must go forth into God with our feeling, above reason;
and there we must abide, onefold, empty of ourselves, and free from
images, lifted up by love into the simple bareness of our intelligence.
For when we go out in love beyond and above all things, and die to all
observation in ignorance and in darkness, then we are wrought and
transformed through the Eternal Word, Who is the Image of the Father. In
this idleness of our spirit, we receive the Incomprehensible Light,
which enwraps us and penetrates us, as the air is penetrated by the
light of the sun. And this Light is nothing else than a fathomless
staring and seeing. What we are, that we behold; and what we behold,
that we are: for our thought, our life, and our being are uplifted in
simplicity, and made one with the Truth which is God. And therefore in
this simple staring we are one life and one spirit with God: and this I
call a contemplative life. <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](asm132.htm#fn_81.md) As soon as we cleave to God
through love, we practise the better part; but when we gaze thus into
our superessence, we possess God utterly. With this contemplation, there
is bound up an exercise which is wayless, that is to say, a noughting of
life; for, where we go forth out of ourselves into darkness and the
abysmal Waylessness, there shines perpetually the simple ray of the
Splendour of God, in which we are grounded, and which draws us out of
ourselves into the superessence, and into the immersion of love. And
with this sinking into love there is always bound up a practice of love
which is wayless; for love cannot be lazy, but would search through and
through and taste through and through the fathomless richness which
lives in the ground of her being, and this is a hunger which cannot be
appeased. But a perpetual striving after the unattainable—this is
swimming against the stream. One can neither leave it nor grasp it,
neither do without it nor attain it, neither be silent on it nor speak
of it, for it is above reason and understanding, and it transcends all
creatures; and therefore we can never reach nor overtake it. But we
should abide within ourselves: there we feel that the Spirit of God is
driving us and enkindling us in this restlessness of love. And we should
abide above ourselves. And then we feel that the Spirit of God is
drawing us out of ourselves and burning us to nothingness in His
Selfhood; that is, in the Superessential Love with which we are one, and
which we possess more deeply and more widely than all else.

This possession is a simple and abysmal tasting of all good and of
eternal life; and in this tasting we are swallowed up above reason and
without reason, in the deep Quiet of the Godhead, which is never moved.
That this is true we can only know by our own feeling, and in no other
way. For how this is, or where, or what, neither reason nor practice can
come to know: and therefore our ensuing exercise always remains wayless,
that is, without manner. For that abysmal Good which we taste and
possess, we can neither grasp nor understand; neither can we enter into
it by ourselves or by means of our exercises. And so we are poor in
ourselves, but rich in God; hungry and thirsty in ourselves, drunken and
fulfilled in God; busy in ourselves, idle in God. And thus we shall
remain throughout eternity. But without the exercise of love, we can
never possess God; and whosoever thinks or feels otherwise is deceived.
And thus we live wholly in God, where we possess our blessedness; and we
live wholly in ourselves, where we exercise ourselves in love towards
God. And though we live wholly in God and wholly in ourselves, yet it is
but one life; but it is twofold and opposite according to our feeling,
for poor and rich, hungry and satisfied, busy and idle, these things are
wholly contrary to one another. Yet with this our highest honour is
bound up, now and in eternity: for we cannot wholly become God and lose
our created being, this is impossible. Did we, however, remain wholly in
ourselves, sundered from God, we should be miserable and unblest. And
therefore we should feel ourselves living wholly in God and wholly in
ourselves; and between these two feelings we should find nothing else
but the grace of God and the exercise of our love. For out of our
highest feeling, the brightness of God shines into us, which teaches us
truth, and moves us towards every virtue and in eternal love towards
God. If we follow this brightness without pause, back into that Source
from whence it comes forth, there we feel nothing but a quenching of our
spirit and an irretrievable down-sinking into simple and fathomless
love. Could we continue to dwell there with our simple gaze, we should
always so feel it; for our immersion and transformation in God continues
without ceasing in eternity, if we have gone forth from ourselves, and
God is ours in the immersion of love. For if we possess God in the
immersion of love—that is, if we are lost to ourselves—God is our own
and we are His own: and we sink ourselves eternally and irretrievably in
our own possession, which is God. This immersion is essential, and is
closely bound up with the state of love: and so it continues whether we
sleep or whether we wake, whether we know it or whether we know it not.
And so it does not earn for us any new degree of reward; but it
maintains us in the possession of God and of all that good which we have
received. And this down-sinking is like a river, which without pause or
turning back ever pours into the sea; since this is its proper
resting-place. So likewise when we possess God alone, the down-sinking
of our being, with the love that belongs to it flows forth, without
return, into a fathomless experience which we possess, and which is our
proper resting-place. Were we always simple, and could we always
contemplate with the same recollection, we should always have the same
experience. Now this immersion is above all virtues, and above every
exercise of love; for it is nothing else than an eternal going out from
ourselves, with a clear looking forward, into an otherness or difference
towards which, outside ourselves, we tend as towards our blessedness.
For we feel an eternal yearning toward something other than what we are
ourselves. And this is the most inward and hidden distinction which we
can feel between God and ourselves, and beyond it there is no difference
any more. But our reason abides here with open eyes in the darkness,
that is, in an abysmal ignorance; and in this darkness, the abysmal
splendour remains covered and hidden from us, for its overwhelming
unfathomableness blinds our reason. But it enwraps us in simplicity, and
transforms us through its selfhood: and thus we are brought forth by
God, out of our selfhood, into the immersion of love, in which we
possess blessedness, and are one with God.

When we are thus made one with God, there abides within us a quickening
knowledge and an active love; for without our own knowledge, we cannot
possess God; and without the practice of love, we cannot be united with
God, nor remain one with Him. For if we could be blessed without our
knowledge, then a stone, which has no knowledge, could also be blessed.
Were I lord over all the world and knew it not, how would it profit me?
And therefore we shall ever know and feel that we taste and possess; and
this is testified by Christ Himself, where He speaks thus of us to His
Father: This, he says, is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, Whom Thou hast sent. And by this you
may understand that our eternal life consists in knowledge with
discernment.
