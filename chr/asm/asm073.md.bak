## CHAPTER XLIII

 

### HE SHALL GO OUT TOWARDS HIMSELF AND TOWARDS ALL GOOD MEN

 

Now the man shall go out towards himself and towards all men of
good-will, and shall taste and behold how that they are tied and bound
together in love; and he shall beseech and pray God that He may let His
customary gifts flow forth, that thereby all may be confirmed in His
love and His eternal worship. This enlightened man shall faithfully and
discreetly teach and instruct, reprove and serve, all men; for he bears
in him a love towards all. And thereby is he a mediator between God and
all men. And then he shall turn wholly inwards upon himself with all the
saints and with all the just, and possess in peace the unity of his
spirit, and therewith the most high Unity of God, wherein all spirits
rest. This is a true ghostly life; for all the degrees and all the
virtues, inward as well as outward, and the highest powers of the soul,
are supernaturally adorned by it in a right and profitable way.
