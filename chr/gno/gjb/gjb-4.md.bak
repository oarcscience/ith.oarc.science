## IV.

## THE FOURTH GOSPEL PROEM:

A NEW VERSION VENTURE.

 

CONNECTION.

   AFTER I had for some time been making a close study of Lidzbarski's
translations of the Mandæan John-Book and Liturgies, I had occasion in
another connection to refer to the Greek text (Westcott & Hort) of the
prologue to the fourth gospel. As I read, I found that a number of
Mandæan associations came welling up from the preconscious, especially
with regard to Life and Light, the use of the term Man and the way the
sentences about John the Baptist linked on to these concepts. I found I
was almost automatically construing parts of this familiar text from a
new angle or at any rate envisaging them in a new perspective. I had
already for long been convinced that the historical references broke
awkwardly into the doctrinal proem proper, and that this contained what
may be called some characteristic general gnostic notions. Moreover I
had long been of the opinion that the proem was based on a 'source'; but
thought that this 'source' was most probably already in Greek when it
was made such deft use of by the inspired writer of the 'pneumatic'
gospel. I now asked myself, could it possibly have been originally in
Aramaic, for there are indubitably some strained constructions in it,
that might be explicable as literal renderings of Semitic idioms.
Translation into Greek would doubtless make the original appear to be
more hellenistically coloured than was actually the case and so
'philosophize' it somewhat. The main difficulty seemed to lie in
determining <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> what could have been the
Semitic original of the leading term rendered by *Logos*? Was it Word or
Wisdom or some other Divine Power or Potency? On this I could form no
conclusion. But further, whatever it was, could it have been translated
by any other Greek term than *Logos*? For the student of comparative
Hellenistic theology is not confined to seeking for parallels or
associations with the idea behind this term in Stoicism and Philo
simply; he has to take into consideration a far wider field of research.
In the Trismegistic literature, for instance, in which the Heavenly Man
doctrine is prominent, the parallel notion is rendered by *Noûs*, Mind,
and in the Hellenistic poem so beloved by the Later Platonists and
generally known as the 'Chaldæan Oracles,'<span
id="page_121_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_121_note_1.md) the Mind of the Father
stands at the summit; while in allied Gnostic tradition connected with
the 'Chaldæan Mysteries' or even said to be based on the 'Chaldæan
Books,' where again the Divine Man doctrine is prominent, the term
preferred is Mind. Mind, moreover, in the Valentinian system stands at
the head of the Plērōma. This is solely with regard to translation into
Greek in the general Hellenistic theological language of the time, and
says nothing about the Semitic or Chaldæan original terms, which may
have been numerous, apart from the very general (notably Egyptian)
Oriental magical notion of creation by the word. Certainly the
Man-doctrine was wide-spread and where personifications were the order
of the day, Man and Mind would go better together than Man and Word or
Reason or even Wisdom. It is, however, with all hesitation that I have
ventured to use the term Mind in my translation, <span id="page_122">p.
122</span> find more to call attention to the problem than anything
else.

   With these ideas—namely the supposal of a probable Aramaic original
of the proem-source and the consequent 'philosophizing' by translation
into Hellenistic Greek of some terms that in the original were more
concretely presented, I attempted the following version. This I did
before I had read Prof. C. F. Burney's recent (1922) arresting study,
entitled *The Aramaic Origin of the Fourth Gospel* (Oxford, The
Clarendon Press). The contention of the Professor of the Interpretation
of Holy Scripture at Oxford, who is so great an authority on the O.T.,
is that not only for the proem but for much, if not the whole, of the
gospel there is an Aramaic background. Whatever may be ultimately
decided on this novel and far-reaching hypothesis, it should inaugurate
a fruitful line of N.T. research. My own venture is far more modest in
every way; I deal with a single 'source' only, and have not the
competence to treat even that technically from the Semitic side. The
only remark I would venture to make on Prof. Burney's labours is in
respect to the Johannine Greek quotations from the O.T. The problem
whether the few of them which differ from the LXX. Greek Targum or
Translation,—the Authorised Version of the time so to say,—were made
freshly from the Hebrew, does not seem to me necessarily to help to
prove the author's contention. They are far more likely to have been
taken from what is said to have been probably the earliest Christian
Greek document,—a collection of proof-texts to establish the claims of
Christian Messianism from O.T. prophecy, at times not without
accommodation. They sometimes agree with and sometimes diverge from the
Septuagint rendering. <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> All this has
been most thoroughly worked out by Proff. Rendel Harris and Vacher Burch
in their indispensable work (Pt. I., 1916, Pt. II., 1920) on the now
famous Testimony Book (*Testimonia contra Judæos*).

   I also conjectured, presumably owing to the rhythms of the Mandæan
books running in my head, that the 'source' might have been in verse;
and found that the Greek broke up easily into some sort of rhythmic
lines. But of course this was pure guesswork on my part. Professor
Burney, however, with his wide knowledge of Hebrew and Palestinian
Aramaic, has come most definitely to this conclusion as to the proem. If
the rest of the gospel cannot be so treated, this seems to me to be an
additional indication that in the prologue we are dealing with a
'source.' Though my tentative translation from the Greek differs both in
analysis and phrasing from Prof. Burney's, I so far see no compelling
reason to alter the phrasing by his, and let the breaking up of the
lines stand to indicate rhythm rather than the measured lines he has so
ingeniously endeavoured to reconstruct into Aramaic.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_121">p. 121</span>

<span id="page_121_note_1"></span>[1](#page_121_fr_1.md) See my 'Echoes
from the Gnosis' series, vols. viii. and ix., *The Chaldæan Oracles*,
London, 1908.

<span id="footnotes_page_123">p. 123</span>

<span id="page_123_note_1"></span>[1](#page_123_fr_1.md) In the original
this was probably the usual cosmological formula 'in the beginning.' The
Greek may suggest a more metaphysical meaning and the Vulgate Latin
seems to continue the process, for *principium* might carry the weaning
of 'primality'; cp. Cicero, *Tusc*. i. 23, 54: "There is no origin of
primality (*principii*); for it is out of primality that all things
originate"; Tertullian, *Adv. Hermog.* 19: "In Greek the term primality,
namely ἀρχή, takes the primacy (*principatum*), not only in the category
of order (*ordinativum*), but also in that of potency (*potestivum*)."

<span id="page_123_note_2"></span>[2](#page_123_fr_2.md) If there is any
Mandæan term with which to seek a parallel it might perhaps be Mānā,
which seems generally to mean Mind. Prof. Rendel Harris in his
illuminating study of the Proem, would make the original of Logos
'Wisdom' (Ḥokhmah), and brings forward some striking quotations from the
O.T. sapiential literature and Patristic commentaries in justification.
This Hebrew (O.T.) and Greek (Apocryphal) Wisdom-literature is clearly
influenced Hellenistically, and the equation Logos = Sophia in the *Gk.
version* of the 4th gospel is of great interest. In addition to R. H.'s
*Origin of the Prologue to St. John.'s Gospel*, see his interesting
paper 'Athena, Sophia and the Logos,' pp. 56-72 of the *Bulletin* of the
John Rylands Library, Manchester, July, 1922. It may be objected that
'Word' is to be preferred, seeing that in the Targums Memrah = the
Creative Word, Logos; but my contention is that the Greek Noûs is nearer
to the Deity than the Greek Logos.

<span id="footnotes_page_124">p. 124</span>

<span id="page_124_note_1"></span>[1](#page_124_fr_1.md) The Gk. phrase
πρὸς τὸν θεόν is a grammatical puzzle; this is, however, probably solved
by the hypothesis of a literal translation from a Semitic original. The
Gnostic Heracleon (2nd cent.); the first known commentator on the fourth
gospel, who was apparently ignorant of Semitics, conjectured that
ἡνωμένος ('at-one-with,' 'in-co-adunition-with') should be supplied;
others think the phrase is Hellenistic (Koinē) for παρὰ τῳ̑ θεόῳ̑—*i.e.*,
'along with,' 'by the side of,' or simply 'with' God. In the Greek text
ὁ θεός is distinguished (and I think deliberately), by the prefixing of
the definite article, from the following simple θεός. But 'The God' is
clumsy in English, and so I resort to the type-trick of capitalization
to mark the distinction.

<span id="page_124_note_2"></span>[2](#page_124_fr_2.md) The Gk. καὶ
renders probably a Semitic particle that serves several other purposes
than that of a purely copulative function.

<span id="page_124_note_3"></span>[3](#page_124_fr_3.md) *Sc*. Mind or God,
not as a second God, but as the Divine or Creative Intelligence of GOD.

<span id="page_124_note_4"></span>[4](#page_124_fr_4.md) Or 'continued to
become' (impf.),—the idea of 'perpetual creation.'

<span id="page_124_note_5"></span>[5](#page_124_fr_5.md) The Old Syriac
versions (*e.g.* C.) read 'in' and not 'through'; see F. C. Burkitt,
*Evangelion da-Mepharreshe: The Curetonian Version of the Four Gospels,
with the Readings of the Sinai Palimpsest and the Early Syriac Patristic
Evidence* (Cambridge, 1904), i. 423. The Old (*i.e.* pre-Peshītṭā)
Syriac versions should be a great help in determining the Aram.
original, as the two dialects are closely related.

<span id="page_124_note_6"></span>[6](#page_124_fr_6.md) *Sc*. Mind.

<span id="page_124_note_7"></span>[7](#page_124_fr_7.md) *Sc*. Mind.

<span id="page_124_note_8"></span>[8](#page_124_fr_8.md) That would be the
Mandæan Second Life.

<span id="page_124_note_9"></span>[9](#page_124_fr_9.md) Or 'The Life'—the
same distinction as with the terms for 'God.'

<span id="page_124_note_10"></span>[10](#page_124_fr_10.md) The article
cannot be neglected; it signifies those who are really Men, *i.e.*
conscious members of the celestial or angelic humanity or true Race. All
this connects with the Anthrōpos-doctrine of the Gnosis. Man (the Aram.
idiom 'Son of Man,' if translated literally, is misleading in Gk.) is
the Celestial or Primal Man, Adam Qadmon. As Thrice-greatest Hermes
says, the vast majority of mortals are not worthy to be called 'Men';
all men have Reason, but few as yet have Mind (*i.e*. are spiritual).
The true Men who have the Light of Life are the Prophets and Perfect.

<span id="page_124_note_11"></span>[11](#page_124_fr_11.md) 'Suppress,'
'hold back,' 'detain.' Burney has 'obscured it not.'

<span id="footnotes_page_125">p. 125</span>

<span id="page_125_note_1"></span>[1](#page_125_fr_1.md) This paragraph

<span id="page_125_note_3"></span>[3](#page_125_fr_3.md) *This* world (Gk.
κόσμος, Heb. *tebel*, Mand. *tibil*); there were other worlds according

world in the wider meaning would be the Heb. *'olam*.

<span id="page_125_note_4"></span>[4](#page_125_fr_4.md) *Sc*. the Light,
*i.e.* the Life of Mind.

<span id="page_125_note_5"></span>[5](#page_125_fr_5.md) If the reader
prefers to personify the Light and its synonyms, he can substitute 'him'
for 'it'; and so also in the following phrases.

<span id="page_125_note_6"></span>[6](#page_125_fr_6.md) *Sc*. creations
(n.pl.), world and other creations up or down to man; cp. [Jn.
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#19:27.md), where the 'disciple whom he
loved' is said to have taken the Mother 'unto his own' (εἰς τὰ ἴδια),
which is generally supposed to mean 'his own home.' 'Its own' therefore
signifies 'habitations.' The following 'its own' (m.pl.) refers to the
'inhabitants.'

<span id="page_125_note_7"></span>[7](#page_125_fr_7.md) *Sc*. spiritual
power—lit. 'allowance,' 'possibility,' generally translated 'authority';
it is not physical power (δύναμις, 'lordship,' 'domination'), but moral
power—'grace.'

<span id="page_125_note_8"></span>[8](#page_125_fr_8.md) That is of Mind.

<span id="page_125_note_9"></span>[9](#page_125_fr_9.md) That is who have
faith in the still higher Power (the mystic 'Name' or Soul, or Mind, or
Primality) of Great Life—GOD.

<span id="footnotes_page_126">p. 126</span>

<span id="page_126_note_1"></span>[1](#page_126_fr_1.md) That is, of
earthly parents; for they were born from Above, *i.e.* were spiritual
births.

<span id="page_126_note_2"></span>[2](#page_126_fr_2.md) It means 'wish'
rather than 'will'—'desire,' 'urge.'

<span id="page_126_note_3"></span>[3](#page_126_fr_3) Lit. 'and' (καὶ.md);
but clearly meaning 'by such birth from above.'

<span id="page_126_note_4"></span>[4](#page_126_fr_4.md) This seems to mean
simply 'was enfleshed.' The Old Syriac has 'body,' not 'flesh'; so also
in 11.

<span id="page_126_note_5"></span>[5](#page_126_fr_5.md) Lit. 'pitched its
tent'; this refers to the extended *sh<sup>e</sup>kīnah*-doctrine. In
the Mandæan tradition *škīnā* is the frequently-recurring technical term
for the 'dwelling,' 'housing,' 'tenting,' or 'spiritual body' or
'glory,' of the celestials—the *ūthrā's* or 'treasures' or perhaps
'fulnesses' (lit. 'riches'). Burney has: "And set his
*sh<sub>e</sub>kīntā* among us," referring solely to Yeshū' Messiah.
*Sh<sup>e</sup>kīntā* is Palestinian Aramaic for Heb.
*sh<sup>e</sup>kīnah*.

<span id="page_126_note_6"></span>[6](#page_126_fr_6.md) Namely the
Prophets or Perfect.

<span id="page_126_note_7"></span>[7](#page_126_fr_7.md) *Mono-genēs*,—this
in pre- and post-Christian Gnostic tradition is the general technical
term for 'born,' 'emanated' or 'created' from a 'single source (μονο-),
*i.e.* one-and-only parent, and is used of spiritual beings who are
superior to the conditions of sex-generation. Cp. the *perikopē* on
Melchi Sedek (King of Peace, Prince of Righteousness) in [Heb.
7:1-21](../../../bib/kjv/heb.htm#7:1.md). He is there said to be
"father-less, mother-less, \[earthly\] genealogy-less, without beginning
of days or end of life, but made-in-the-likeness of GOD'S Son." In
common speech *monogenēs* is usually found as meaning the only one of a
kind; if only one daughter has been born to a man, she would be
characterized as *monogenēs*. But the vulgar tongue is *not* the
language of mysticism. In the above-referred to article (p. 123) Prof.
Rendel Harris thinks that the meaning of *monogenēs* as 'child of one
parent only,' as applied to Athena born from the head of Zeus, which he
suggests, but rejects, is a 'quite new' idea; but I have been insisting
on it for a score of years at least. He would render it as 'darling,'
but this is really too *bourgeois*.

in 12<span class="small">1</span>; it is m. sing.

<span id="page_126_note_9"></span>[9](#page_126_fr_9.md) The root-meaning
of χάρις.

<span id="page_126_note_10"></span>[10](#page_126_fr_10.md) This is the
second redactorial interpolation or overworking.

<span id="page_126_note_11"></span>[11](#page_126_fr_11.md) The Greek
translator unquestionably understood this as referring to Yeshū'
Messiah. But the puzzling phrasing of the quotation from the Baptist
*logoi*-tradition—'my First'—seems to require 'it' instead of 'him,'
*viz*., the Mind-Life-Light of the 'source,' as in the first
interpolation.

<span id="footnotes_page_127">p. 127</span>

<span id="page_127_note_1"></span>[1](#page_127_fr_1.md) Cp. L. and S. Lex.
*s.v.* ἔμπροσθεν: "The *future* is unseen and was therefore regarded as
*behind* us, whereas the *past* is known and therefore *before* our
eyes."

<span id="page_127_note_2"></span>[2](#page_127_fr_2.md) Inexplicable in
the usual translation, but it might refer to First Life in Mandæan
tradition.

<span id="page_127_note_3"></span>[3](#page_127_fr_3.md) Or *plērōma*
picking up the 'full' of 13<span class="small">3</span>.

<span id="page_127_note_4"></span>[4](#page_127_fr_4.md) This seems to me
to be a distinct reference to the Gnostic notion of pairs or syzygies in
the Plērōma; cp. the "Hence pairing with each other (ἀντιστοιχου̑ντες)"
of the *Apophasis* ascribed to Simon Magus (Hippolytus, *Ref*. vi. 18).
The term is used by Xenophon (*Ana*. v. 4, 12) of two bands of dancers
facing each other in rows or pairs (see my *Simon Magus*, 1892, p. 20).

<span id="page_127_note_5"></span>[5](#page_127_fr_5.md) The third
interpolation or overworking of the 'source.'

<span id="page_127_note_6"></span>[6](#page_127_fr_6.md) Ιησου̑ς
Χριστός—Yēsūs Ḥristos. I have, however, kept what I hold to be the
Heb.-Aram. original name-combination. It means the Anointed Saviour or
Liberator—that is Saviour or Vindicator anointed by the Divine Spirit or
Creative and Perfecting Life of God; cp, the O.T. Joshua. (LXX. Jesus).

<span id="page_127_note_7"></span>[7](#page_127_fr_7.md) Cp. the Jewish
Gnostic commentator of the Naassene Document, quoting from a prior
'scripture,' or an oral '*logos*' ('what was spoken'): "His voice we
heard, but his form we have not seen." (See my analysis of this very
important Gnostic Document in *Thrice-greatest Hermes*, London, 1906, in
Prolegomena, § 'The Myth of Man in the Mysteries'; the quotation is to
be found in i. 169.) Compare with this [Jn.
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#5:37.md): "Ye have never at any time heard
his voice, nor have ye seen his form," addressed to the Jews in general;
whereas the Naassene quotation refers to the Perfect. This is very
important, for if my analysis of the NN. document, which Hippolytus
copied, is correct, the Jewish mystic, who commented on the Hellenistic
source, was in all probability contemporary with Philo (c. 30 B.C. -45
A.D.), and therefore we have here an indication of another 'source' of
the fourth gospel (of which there may have been a number).

<span id="page_127_note_8"></span>[8](#page_127_fr_8.md) The Gk. ὁ ὢν εἰς
τὸν κόλπον ('*into* the bosom') is grammatically impossible: it must
rest on a Semitic idiom. The Old Syriac (C.) has Son *from* the bosom of
the Father.

<span id="page_127_note_9"></span>[9](#page_127_fr_9.md) Cp. the Commentary
of Ephraim Syrus, which runs: "The word of the Father came from His
bosom, and clothed itself with a body in another bosom; from bosom to
bosom it went forth, and pure bosoms have been filled from it: blessed
is He who dwelleth in us!" (Burkitt, *op. cit.*, ii. 1-10).

<span id="page_127_note_10"></span>[10](#page_127_fr_10.md) Namely the
gospel which follows; the verb has no object. The Gk. ἐξηγήσατο means
also 'related in full,' 'set forth'; the Mandæan technical term is
'discoursed.'
