## III.

## THE SLAVONIC JOSEPHUS' ACCOUNT OF THE BAPTIST AND JESUS.

IN The *Antiquities* of the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus there are
three passages of outstanding importance for Christian readers, seeing
that they are the only external witnesses to Christianity from the first
century. As such they have been submitted to the closest
cross-examination and scrutiny. The general result of the enquiry into
the authenticity of their testimony has established for most scholars
the judgment, that we have here to deal not with a homogeneous body of
evidence, but with three different witnesses, one of which is distinctly
good, another as distinctly bad, and a third very probably good. The
passage on John the Baptist is well-nigh universally accepted as
affording no grounds for reasonable scepticism, and as therefore
providing a most valuable external proof that John was a historical
character. The account of Jesus, on the other hand, has been called into
most serious question by the vast majority of liberal scholars, and by
very many conservatives, on numerous grounds, and chiefly because the
writer unequivocally affirms that Jesus was the Messiah,—a statement
which no Jew could have made. The third is a reference to James, the
brother of Jesus 'called' or 'said to be Messiah'—a hesitation which may
fairly be ascribed to Josephus <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> himself.
Many then who reject the Jesus-passage as indubitably spurious, accept
the James-reference as free from reasonable suspicion, and thus obtain a
brief but valuable external first-century evidence for earliest
Christianity.

   Josephus composed his *Antiquities* in Greek, and completed them in
93/94 A.D. They are a general survey of the traditions and history of
his people up to the special period of which he had already treated in
detail in his first and most famous work, *The Jewish War*. In
describing there the events which led up to the outbreak of the revolt,
he treats of all the other religious and political movements in
Palestine, even the most insignificant, contemporary with the beginnings
of Christianity, and yet he says not a single word about the Baptist or
Jesus. This is a very striking and puzzling omission. Where precisely we
should expect to find such mention, and where far greater opportunities
occur for bringing it in than in *The Antiquities*, we are confronted
with 'the silence of Josephus.' The *War* was first of all composed in
Aramaic and circulated among the Jews of Palestine and Babylonia,
doubtless to convince them of the futility of resisting the might of the
Roman arms. Of this original edition, however, no trace has so far been
discovered. The work known to us is in Greek. It is not a translation so
much as a re-composition very carefully prepared on the models of Greek
history; and in this Josephus sought the help of Greek stylists. It
reads indeed like an original composition; whatever the Aramaic
contained, the work as it now stands has been clearly adapted to suit
the mentality of the wider public of the Greco-Roman world and the
literary circles of the day to whom it was presented. <span
id="page_99">p. 99</span> This Greek edition was composed between 75 and
79 A.D. It is of course not impossible to suppose that in the Aramaic
there may have been reference to the John- and Jesus- movements. But why
then should Josephus have cut them out, when there is an indubitable
passage concerning John and a higher probable reference to Jesus in *The
Antiquities*? To conjecture a satisfactory answer to this dilemma is
exceedingly difficult; it remains an unsolved *crux*. For had there been
any such passages in the Aramaic edition of the *War*, surely Christian
apologists would have seized upon them and insisted that they should be
restored to the Greek text?—unless by chance they contained matter they
would not like to see in wider circulation. That clear light will ever
be thrown on this 'silence of Josephus' problem is hardly to be
expected.

   Nevertheless the subject may be said to have recently entered on a
new phase: certain hitherto unknown material has been brought forward,
which has forced the problem once more into the arena of controversy;
and it may very well be that in the future this new material will have
always, directly or indirectly, to be taken into consideration whenever
the familiar Josephean passages are reviewed or rediscussed.

   There is extant in a number of MSS. a Slavonic or Old Russian
translation of the *War*. In this version there are no less than eight
pieces referring to John the Baptist (3), Jesus (4) and the first
Christians (1). These remarkable passages, of which the Greek text shows
no trace, have been excerpted and the Slavonic text of them critically
established by the collation of four MSS.

   In the first place it is agreed on all hands by the German scholars
who have investigated them, that <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> these
pieces were not originally composed in Slavonic and interpolated into
the translation. Not only is the style foreign to correct Slavonic
idiom, but the peculiar nature of the contents is so alien to Slavonic
mentality, that to suppose so late a writer as a Slavonic translator,
who could at the very earliest be assigned only to the 10th century, is
out of the question. They are indubitably translations, and moreover
clearly rendered from Greek. This is shown not only by the construction
of the sentences in general, but also by the clumsiness and uncertainty
of the translator in his rendering of particles and conjunctions;
moreover the Greek original for the veil or curtain of the temple
(*katapetasma*) is retained.

   These eight pieces were excerpted from the rest of the text and first
made accessible for the general world of scholarship, in German
translation, by A. Berendts, in 1906.<span
id="page_100_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_100_note_1.md)

   The consensus of learned opinion in Germany (and elsewhere apparently
no notice whatever has been taken of the 'find') from the start has been
entirely unfavourable to their authenticity. That is to say, no one has
so far ventured to claim them for Josephus himself. They were
immediately and almost unanimously dismissed as transparent Christian
forgeries, and that too of a late date and of no sort of historic value
of any kind. Here and there, however, were signs of some hesitation in
endorsing so wholesale and precise a verdict; for a few, the matter
seemed not so simple as it appeared at first sight. The first *caveat*
was entered and the subject brought into a new perspective by R. Seeberg
in a somewhat popular but <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> highly
suggestive treatment, which he boldly entitled 'A New Source for the
Earliest History of Christianity.'<span
id="page_101_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_101_note_1.md) Though Seeberg's
reputation as a specialist on questions of origins forbade the rejection
of his view as that of an irresponsible eccentric, no attention was paid
to it, perhaps because he had not attempted to work out his theory in
detail. This task, however, was speedily undertaken by Johannes Frey, of
the University of Dorpat, who had just published a very valuable and
thorough-going study of the History of the Passion. In 1908 Frey
produced a substantial volume,<span
id="page_101_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_101_note_2.md) in which he treated the
material to an acute analysis and with minute elaboration, and in other
respects showed a remarkable grasp of all the puzzling complexities of a
whole series of problems which an intensive scrutiny of the passages
brought out.

   In the first place Frey called attention to the fact that the general
characteristics of these pieces were very different from those of all
other ancient Christian forgeries known to us. His main contention
throughout this very thorough enquiry is that the author, whoever he may
have been precisely, must be held in general to be a Jew and not a
Christian. There is no evidence of direct dependence on early canonical
Christian literature, no sign that he had any acquaintance with the
precision of written tradition. In so far as there is agreement with the
Gospels or Acts, it is only in respect to the barest generalities; there
is nothing even to show acquaintance with the precise inner oral
traditions of the Christians themselves. It is all set forth from an
external standpoint. Nevertheless <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> the
writer is not simply fabricating freely out of his imagination. He has
traditional material of some sort to go on. He is trying to set forth
what he has heard and gathered, and what at times puzzles him
considerably. He reports opinion—what people say; some this, others
that. He would also play the part of the impartial historian,
considering probabilities and even possibilities. He is not a hostile
critic by any means; on the contrary, he is in general sympathetic.
Indeed he regards both John and Jesus as outstanding personalities, even
astonishingly so, and his sympathies are enlisted for them because he
thinks they have both been most unjustly done to death. His attitude is
thus in general that of a friendly Jewish outsider—a very difficult part
for a convinced Christian to play without betraying himself in some
fashion as a believer in the full Christian claims. He, however, nowhere
asserts that Jesus was the Messiah. Frey's main contention, then,
following Seeberg, is that the writer worked on Jewish general popular
oral sources; in other words, he had at his disposal traditions
proximate to the occurrences, and therefore worthy of attention as
giving a picture of an early outside view of nascent Christianity.

   Seeberg thinks that Christian manipulation must be admitted in three
or four places; but Frey tries to show that he is here mistaken. Frey is
perhaps not sufficiently cautious in thus leaving no loophole. But even
with this qualification, if the main contention of both scholars can
stand, the possibility of our being faced with early external traditions
of some kind is a matter of quite extraordinary interest, and deserves
the careful attention of all students of Christian beginnings.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

   As practically nothing is known of these passages by English readers,
it may be of service to present those few of them who see this study,
with a translation of the German version of these eight extracts. They
may then judge for themselves how the contents strike them. But whatever
may be their opinion as to their value or worthlessness, it cannot be
denied that every scrap of material, however intractible, that can be
held by any trained mind to contain the possibility of having even the
remotest bearing on the surroundings of earliest Christianity, possesses
a unique interest and fascination of its own; for the first century is
otherwise practically silent outside the New Testament documents.

   The version that follows is made from the German translation given in
Frey's volume; I have, however, added the sub-titles. It is literal and
clumsy, like the German, which faithfully follows the Slavonic. The
variant readings in the MSS. are slight, and I have not noted them in
detail. For the present paper is intended for the general reader solely,
and not for the specialist, who must deal at first hand with Frey's
technical exposition, which, as far as I am aware, has not yet been
disposed of, or indeed in any way answered.

   In conclusion a few very general remarks may be added calling
attention to the most salient points.

   In the John-pieces (I.-III.) there is nothing sufficiently
distinctive to show any literary dependence on the New Testament
accounts. On the contrary, there are entire novelties and wide
divergences. In the first place the strong political colouring given by
the writer to the proclamation of the prophet is quite out of keeping
with anything to be found in the Christian presentation. But the most
striking difference is the protracted period assigned to John's
activity. 'At that time' means during the ethnarchy of Archelaus. Now
Herod the Great died in 4 B.C., and Archelaus, who succeeded him, was
deposed in 6 A.D. It is quite inconceivable that any Christian writer
who had the gospel-story before him, could have made what would be so
astounding a statement to Christian ears,—one that would at once appear
to the most moderately instructed as an egregious blunder. Surely the
last thing an intelligent forger would desire to do would be to give
occasion to his readers to call the canonical narrative into question
concerning so prominent a feature as John's almost equal age with Jesus,
and so practically invite them to dismiss all the graphic details of the
birth-stories as fictitious?—unless <span id="page_111">p. 111</span> it
be that he wrote before these stories were in circulation. No one short
of a lunatic would concoct 'evidence' against his own side. The writer
must therefore have moved in circles who would see no difficulty in
assigning to John a public activity of at least 30 years; for he tells
us that John survived the death of Philip, which took place somewhere
between 33 and 36 A.D.

   The cross-examination of John by the authorities and the incident of
Simon the Essene are also arresting novelties; but there is nothing
improbable in them. The introduction of the name Essene does not in any
way depend on Christian tradition; for the surprising fact is that,
though there are close parallels between some of the doctrines of the
Essenes and gospel-ethics, and between some of their practices and the
regulations, for instance, laid down for the mission of the apostles and
the communal observances of the earliest Christian communities, the New
Testament writers never mention the name. The wording of the refusal of
John at the end of his rebuke to disclose a certain mystery to his
official opponents has led some to the supposition that this is a
cryptic reference to Jesus,—meaning 'the mystery dwelling among you.'
That of course would be impossible at so early a date as prior to A.D.
6. But surely, quite apart from this, a Christian apologist would have
been at pains to bring out clearly so essential a feature as John's
acknowledgment of the Messiahship of Jesus, and not go out of his way to
disguise it? It is a curious and thought-provoking phrase. It may refer
to the 'kingdom,' to the indwelling rule and law of God, that is brought
to consciousness in the hearts of the repentant; or it may possibly be
that John had <span id="page_112">p. 112</span> some inner mystical
doctrine to reveal, for we have to remember that the Mandæan or Gnostic
John-tradition, which has come down to our own days, has ever laid the
greatest stress on the mystical element in the teaching of the Baptizer.

   The interpretation of the dream of Philip, like the stress laid upon
John's strange appearance and dress and his extraordinary mode of life,
is just such a detail as would strike the imagination and linger in the
memory of the people. What more likely and in keeping with precedent
than that a prophet should interpret the dream of the king? But here we
have, not only a novelty for readers of the gospel-account, but also a
contradiction with Josephus himself. The unfavourable character given to
Philip, the stress laid on his 'venality,' is in complete contrast with
the reputation given him by Josephus in his *Antiquities* (XVIII. iv.
6), where he is praised for the mild and peaceable disposition he
displayed in his government, and for the personal interest he took in
the administration of justice. Now the *Antiquities* was completed in
93/94 A.D. Had then our writer known it, he would not presumably have
made Josephus contradict himself so egregiously. This raises the
question as to the possibility of his having written before the
*Antiquities* got into wide circulation.

   Piece III. in some respects agrees with and in others differs from
the synoptic account of the marriage of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of
Galilee and Peræa, with the wife (Slav. Jos. widow) of his brother
Philip. But Josephus himself in his *Antiquities* (XVIII. v. 1 and 4)
tells the story quite differently from both. There we read that Herodias
was married first of all to Herod Boëthus, and that the wife of Philip
was Salome, the <span id="page_113">p. 113</span> daughter of this
union; so that Philip was son-in-law of Herodias. Herod Antipas, says
Josephus, was the second husband of Herodias, and the marriage took
place while the first husband, Boëthus, was still alive. Josephus,
moreover, says that Philip died childless; while our author avers that
he left four children surviving him. Moreover Josephus in the famous
passage concerning John in the *Antiquities* (XVIII. v. 2) knows nothing
of John's execution being due to so personal a cause as is depicted both
by the gospels and our author, though very differently; it is in the
*Antiquities* ascribed solely to Antipas' apprehension of the political
consequences of the John-movement. Our author is then clearly ignorant
of both the *Antiquities*-account and also of the most characteristic
feature of the gospel-narrative, the graphic story of the dancing of the
daughter of Herodias. Everything therefore goes to show that he is
drawing on some other traditional source.

   Finally, as the climax to John's extraordinary scruples about food,
it is asserted that he would not touch unleavened bread even at
Passover-time,—an absolutely obligatory observance in Jewry. Moreover he
is made to give an exegetical justification for his abstention. This is
the distinctive touch of a Jewish hand; it is exceedingly unlikely that
it would ever have occurred to a late Christian.

   As to the John-pieces then we seem to be moving in a thoroughly
Jewish atmosphere, and there is nothing characteristically Christian
about them.

   The Jesus-pieces (IV. and VI. to VIII.) are naturally the most
arresting and form the main *crux* of the whole matter. It seems to be
generally held that all the eight pieces are by the same hand. They
<span id="page_114">p. 114</span> may be said to have in general the
same terms of expression, to breathe the same spirit and present similar
characteristics. In the main Jesus-pieces the author makes a show of
trying to get at a reasonable point of view; but he hesitates in his
judgment and frankly confesses his inability to make up his mind. He is
convinced that the more generally credible events themselves are
historic; but as to the sheerly miraculous elements he is content to set
them forth as rumours giving rise to absolutely contradictory opinions.
So non-committal and rationalistic a proceeding is quite foreign to the
mentality of a convinced Christian. This attitude of reserve and the
very striking divergences of the writer from the gospel-accounts are in
the sharpest possible distinction to the perspective and procedure of
the compilers of such apocryphal documents as the *Acts of Pilate* and
*The Gospel of Peter*. In the latter the literary dependence on the
gospels is manifest on all hands; what is added is in no way
contradictory, but adduced solely to exalt the greatness of Jesus and
heighten the impression of the miraculous element.

   If piece IV. is carefully and critically compared with the famous
spurious passage concerning Jesus in our text of the *Antiquities*
(XVIII. iii. 3), it will at once be seen that if there is any possible
question of dependence between them, it is not on the side of our
author. Even among the opinions he cites, there is no hint of
Messiahship. When he says that some "supposed that he had been sent by
God," it means no more than what he makes John assert of
himself,—namely, that he was a prophet. It seems to me moreover highly
improbable that any late Christian could have referred to his Lord, the
one and only Son <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> of God, as 'that
wonder-doer' or the 'crucified wonder-doer Jesus.'

   The divergences from the gospel-account of the Jesus-story are so
striking that they need not be dwelt on. To every instructed Christian
the gospel-narratives are presumably so familiar in all their details,
that the contradictions with our author's account will present
themselves automatically. Nevertheless the more one meditates on the
account in piece IV. of the typical external acts of the ministry and
the intrigues of the Jewish authorities to compass the death of Jesus,
the more does it seem within its own measures not to be inconsistent; in
fact it hangs very well together from an outside point of view. That
view is in no way due to a manipulation of gospel-information; it is
based on very different data, and has all the appearance of an honest
attempt to piece together and interpret floating traditions and
conjectures reflected from days contemporaneous perchance with the
attempts of the 'many' to set forth the events, as the introduction to
the Lukan gospel informs us.

   The phrase 'servants' as applied to the disciples, it may be noted,
is a thoroughly Jewish conception; it was used by the Rabbis to
emphasize the relationship between pupils and teacher. The precise
figure 150 may be a round number; otherwise it depends on a tradition
for which the 12 and the 70 were of no importance.

   The final sentence, which avers, not only that the Jewish authorities
themselves crucified Jesus, but that this was in accordance with the
Law, is so astonishing in the latter respect that it has been set down
to a gross blunder of the Slavonic translator from the Greek original,
which may have read 'contrary to the <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>
Law'—κυτὺ with the genitive and not the accusative. This seems a
reasonable supposition; though we must remember that Jewish rulers in
Maccabæan days did crucify their political opponents.

   The trilingual inscription statement (VI.) is a wild piece of
fanciful combination. The writer has heard of an inscription connected
with the execution of Jesus; indeed it was required by law that the
formal charge should be placarded in all cases of capital punishment.
Moreover he has heard that this particular notice was set forth in three
languages; and he also has heard that there were trilingual inscriptions
outside the inner court of the Temple. In combining the two he departs
so far from his general sobriety that we might almost think the passage
was by another hand; but this is otherwise not probable. The first
charge against Jesus was that he had excited the people to revolt; of
this he was acquitted by Pilate. The authorities had then to give some
other excuse: Jesus was executed not because of any Messianistic
agitation, but because he prophesied disaster to the temple and the holy
city. Some excuse had to be found that would placate the people.

   In piece VII. the rending of the veil and the reference to many other
portents seem to depend on characteristically Christian tradition; but
it need not be supposed that this tradition was in the fixed gospel-form
in which we now have it. The phrase 'prior to this generation' is
intended to mean some 30/40 years before Josephus wrote his History
(75-79 A.D.). It is interesting to note that at that time similar
portents were in the air; for Jewish tradition (the Talmūds and Josephus
himself, *B.J.* VI. v. 3) makes mention of a mysterious spontaneous
opening of the heavy iron <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> temple-doors
40 years before the destruction of Jerusalem) and the *Gospel of the
Hebrews* refers to a similarly mysterious breach in the iron threshold
of the same doors. There were widespread legends of portents current in
the folk-memory. Our author then goes on to treat of the rumours and
contradictory statements about the resurrection; and here, as before, he
ruminates on possibilities, giving the conjectural pros and cons, but
declining to commit himself on the side of the most vital belief of
Christendom.

   Piece V., concerning the early Christians, is equally as far from
literary dependence on the canonical Acts as are the Jesus-pieces on the
Gospels. There are wide divergences; and the whole produces an
impression of utter ignorance of the detailed, methodical setting-forth
of the thirty years of history contained in the Acts. Isolated facts,
such as Paul's being sent to Cæsar at Rome, are absurdly generalized on
the one hand, and on the other the events of decades are crammed into
the narrow time-frame of some four years, the period of office of the
two governors mentioned (44-48 A.D.). The phrase "But if they do not
issue from the counsel of God, they will quickly be convicted" is
thought by some to indicate literary dependence on a similar saying in
the Acts. But the latter famous utterance, ascribed to Gamaliel (prior
to 7 A.D.), is worded so very differently that, if any connection
between them can be supposed, it may well be ascribed in both cases to
the uncertain echoing in the popular mind of a well-known Rabbinical
pronouncement.

   In conclusion, then, it may be said that the hope of extracting
anything of value out of these astonishing and puzzling interpolations
depends on establishing <span id="page_118">p. 118</span> the
reasonableness of the hypothesis, that they are based on echoes of
popular traditions still floating about in the Jewish environment of
Christianity in, say, the last third of the first century. There is, I
think, much that goes to show the likelihood of this supposal, or at
least to deter us from summarily dismissing it. But even if we are
persuaded to this extent, we are confronted with the still more
difficult task of imagining a satisfactory conjecture as to the status
and motive of the writer.

   If we hold him to have been a Jew, as the above analysis seems to
require, what plausible motive can we ascribe to him for interpolating
the matter into the text of Josephus? Was he a disinterested lover of
history who thought that Josephus had fallen short of historical
impartiality by neglecting to mention two such remarkable personages as
John and Jesus and two such important movements as those associated with
their names, and desired to amend the historian in this respect in days
when copyright had not yet been dreamed of? Or may we assume that a
pupil of Josephus would think himself entitled to amend the narrative?

   If, on the contrary, he was a Christian, the interest in filling the
gaps would be easily understandable, had he based himself on canonical
tradition. But the divergences from and flat contradictions of that
tradition are so extraordinary, that one is all the time kept asking in
astonishment: What sort of a Christian could this man ever have been?

   To have succeeded in producing such an impression designedly argues
the procedure of a mind of such extraordinary subtlety and psychological
dexterity that it is too uncanny for credence. Any deliberate attempt
<span id="page_119">p. 119</span> of this kind would surely have
betrayed itself in some way; but as a matter of fact there is no
indication of subtle manipulation of gospel-data anywhere. It is not
only very difficult but entirely out of the question to think that any
late Christian forger could have thus deliberately challenged the firmly
established canonical tradition on so many points. Therefore if the
writer were a Christian, he must have been a first-century man; that is
to say he wrote before the Greek canonical gospels were in general
circulation or at any rate before they had penetrated to his
environment.

   There remains only one other possible conjecture—from which everybody
has so far instinctively shrunk: Can the writer after all have been
Josephus himself? But if so, why does he contradict himself so
flatly,—to say nothing of the difficulty of conjecturing his motive for
cutting out the passages?

   It thus appears that, whatever hypothesis of authorship we
make—whether Christian, Jew or Josephus, we are left floundering in a
welter of inconsistencies; all that can be said is that the Jew
alternative is the least improbable.

   And there we must leave this baffling problem, in the hope that our
readers will at any rate be interested in having it brought to their
notice; for in any case these passages must be considered striking
curiosities, even perhaps the greatest to be found, in the ancient
literature that is generally classed under the caption—'Christian
forgeries.'
