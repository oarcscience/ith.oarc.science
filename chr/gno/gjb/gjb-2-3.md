### III.—SOME TYPICAL EXTRACTS.

UNDER the first two headings readers have been made acquainted with all
those pieces from the Mandæan John-Book that can be held to have in any
sense a historic intention. To these are now added a few extracts of
such specimens of the rest of the contents as do not require a
commentary.

   We will begin with 'The Fisher of Souls' tractate from the John-Book.
It seems to me to throw great light on the symbolic phrase of the
gospels, indeed to give it a background, and not to be explained in
reverse order as the Mandæan expansion of an isolated Christian
expression.

 

> THE FISHER OF SOULS SAGA (§§ 36-39)<span
> id="page_71_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span

>
> In the Name of Great Life may hallowed Light be glorified.
>
>    A FISHER am I, a Fisher who elect is among fishers. A Fisher am I
> who among the fishers is chosen, the Head of all catchers of fish. I
> know the shallows of the waters, the inner . . . and the . . . I
> fathom; I come to the net-grounds, to the shallows and all
> fishing-spots, and search the marsh in the dark all over. My boat is
> not cut off \[from the others\] and I shall not be stopped in the
> night.
>
>    I see the fish<span id="page_71_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
> class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_71_note_2) in (? on.md) the dike. I
> pressed forward on the way with a . . . that was not of iron. I
> covered (?) the . . . which was for us an obstruction. Aside did I
> push the swimmers <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> who hinder Life's
> way. On my head I set up a . . . in whose shadow the fish sit. The
> fisher-trident which I have in my hand, is instead a *margnā* select,
> a staff of pure water, at whose sight tremble the fishers.
>
>    I sit in a boat of glory and come into this world (Tibil) of the
> fleeting. I come to the water's surface; thither to the surface of the
> water I drew, and I drew to the crossing's surface. I come in a . . .
> , in slow, steady course. The water by my boat is not ruffled, and no
> sound of my boat is heard. Before me stands Hibil (Abel), at my side
> Shitil (Seth) of sweet name is to be seen, close by me, close in front
> of me, Anōsh (Enoch) sits and proclaims.
>
>    They say: "O Father, Good Fisher, hallo! O Fisher of loveable
> name!"
>
>    Close by me, close near my boat, I hear the uproar (?) of the
> fishers, the fishers who eat fish,<span
> id="page_72_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
> class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_72_note_1.md) and their stench rushes
> on me,—the uproar of the fishers and the uproar of their mongers who
> revile and curse one another. Everyone accuses the other. The buyer
> says to the fisher: "\[Take back?\] thy fish! They are stinking
> already, and no one wants to buy them off of me. Thou makest the catch
> far out at sea,<span id="page_72_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
> class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_72_note_2.md) so that loss falls on
> the buyer."
>
>    Thereon speaks the fisher and makes the man, his customer, hear: "A
> curse on thee, a curse on thy buyers, a curse on thy bell,<span
> id="page_72_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
> class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_72_note_3.md) a curse on thy boat for
> not filling up. Thou hast brought no salt and sprinkled it over thy
> fish which thou boughtest, so that the fish of thy boat will not be
> stinking and thou then canst sell for hard cash. Next, hast thou no
> meal and no dates brought, no salt . . . hast thou brought. If then
> thou comest with empty hands, one who is of fair favour has no dealing
> with thee. Go, go, thou godless \[fellow\], buy not from us to do
> business with thy fraudulent scales. Thou holdest them down to buy at
> false weight, \[then in selling\] keepest them up with thy elbow and
> gettest ten for five. Now does thy buying flee away, and thy buyer,

> men and dost cherish no noble thought."

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

>    When the Chief Fisher, the Head of the race of the Living, the
> highest of all catchers of fish, heard this, he said to him (? Anōsh):
> "Bring me my . . . , hand me the *squbrā*,<span
> id="page_73_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
> class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_73_note_1.md) that I may make a call
> sound forth into the marsh, that I may warn the fish of the depths and
> scare away the foul-smelling birds that pursue after my fish. I will
> catch the great *sidmā*,<span id="page_73_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
> class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_73_note_2.md) and tear off his wings
> on the spot. I will take from him \* \* \* and will blow into my
> *squbrā*. A true *squbrā* is it, so that the water may not mix with
> pitch."
>
>    When the fishers heard the call, their heart fell down from its
> stay. One calls to the other and speaks to him: "Go into thy inner
> ground. For there is the call of the Fisher, the Fisher who eats no
> fish. His voice is not like that of a fisher, his *squbrā* not like
> our *squbrā*. His voice is not like our voice, his discourse not like
> to this world."
>
>    But the fishers stand there; they seek not shelter in their inner
> ground. As the fishers stand there and are thinking it over, the

> He cast them bound into the ... . He tied them up with knots. They
> speak to him: "Free us from our bonds, so that thy fish may not leap
> up to our boat. We catch not those who name thy Name."
>
>    When the fishers thus spake to me, I smote them with a club made of
> iron. I bound their traders on the shore which lends not . . . (?). I
> roped them with ropes of bast and broke up their ships \* \* \* \* . I

> id="page_73_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span

> They cast not the cast-net therein and take not . . . and aloe.
>
>    I spake to those who eat the . . . of the fish whose name is eel.
> They eat the eel and the . . . , which stands upright on its forefeet.
> They eat the ... ... ... ... . I bound them in the marshes of

> "Draw your boat up here, so that it runs not into the dike."
>
>    As the Chief of the fish-catchers thus spake, the fishers made
> answer unto him and said; "Blessed be thou, a Fisher, and blessed be

> be thy hired servants. We will bake and stir about broth and bring it
> before thee. Eat, and the crumbs which fall from thy hand,—these will
> we eat and therewith be filled."
>
>    But I made answer unto them: "O ye fishers, who lap up your filth,
> no fisher am I who fishes for fish, and I was not formed for an eater

   Other pieces set forth such figures as those of 'The <span
id="page_81">p. 81</span> Heavenly Plough' and of 'The Sowers'; but
perhaps the most interesting is the saga of 'The Good Shepherd.' Here
again it is difficult to believe that it was derived from Christian
sources; it seems to be as independent as the 'Fisher of Souls' figure.
The 'discourse' runs as follows:

>    A SHEPHERD am I who loves his sheep; sheep and lambs I watch over.

   The next piece I have selected, treats of the source of all glory and
enlightenment, called the Treasury of Life, that in which all spiritual
powers and blessings are stored. The origin of the motive is without
doubt the Iranian concept of the *ḥvareno*, the divine and kingly glory.
In the Mandæan tradition it has become highly developed and is
frequently personified as a female greatness. Thus in the Oxford MS. F.
it is spoken of as "the Mother of all the Kings \[of the Light\], from
whom all worlds have come forth, who separated herself from the fervency
of the Hidden Mysteries." Many *rôles* are assigned to this Light of
Life in the complexities of the celestial and cosmic dramas; and in the
human stage it shines forth as the glory with which the perfected are
vestured and <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> crowned. I have chosen the
simplest of the narratives or discourses on the topic. In the still more
complex system of the phase of development represented by the *Pistis
Sophia* collection there is no mention of the Treasury of Life, but the
Treasury of Light is one of its most important conceptions. The Mandæan
tradition conserves the echoes of an earlier phase, for it is
indubitably less over-worked.

   That the Mandæan religion preserves echoes of a wealth of ancient
mythical elements found in Iranian, Babylonian and Semitic traditions is
evident on all hands. A process of syncretism had presumably gone on for
generations before an impulse from within caused the blending to assume
a distinctively Mandæan form; and when this emerged, the preservation of
the memory of the process had no interest for the faith and fell back
into the depths of the subconscious. At any-rate the writers or
recorders of the tractates throughout seem honestly persuaded of the
complete independence of their tradition from every other form of
religion. They are for ever proclaiming the blessings of loyalty to what
they claim to be the original, the one and only, revelation of Truth
vouchsafed to the world throughout the ages, and declaring that
continued spiritual contact with instructors from on high who mediated
this divine wisdom, was still possible. They certainly do not give one
the idea of being intellectualists consciously at work on a syncretic
synthesis of prior material; on the contrary they seem to live and move
in a milieu of prophetical outpourings and to have been extremely
sensitive to psychical impressions. Inspirational discourses and
intuitive interpretations of prophetical <span id="page_89">p. 89</span>
utterances seem to have been their delight. The following piece may
enable the reader to sense somewhat of the peculiar atmosphere of
mystical expectancy in which they sought instruction. The topic is one
of the chief points of their questioning—the conflict that arose between
the Light and the Darkness in the beginnings and how victory is to be
achieved. They were not of course absolute Dualists, for always and
everywhere victory lies with Life Everlasting, who transcends not only
the Darkness but also the Light.

   That the moral instruction given to the Mandæans is excellent may be
seen in almost any piece; but there are distinctive collections of
ethical exhortation of which the following is an example.

 

> EXHORTATIONS (§ 47).
>
>    FROM the Light-region have I (Life's Gnosis) come forth, from thee,

   The Mandæans possess a rich collection of liturgical songs and hymns
which Lidzbarski has translated for the first time in his excellent
edition of them (*Mandäische Liturgien*, Berlin, 1920). From these 236
hymns we choose one of the most typical as a specimen, and as perhaps of
more than ordinary interest to the general reader who may have puzzled
over the unqualified beatitude "Blessed are the poor." It is taken from
the Oxford Collection (Bk. I., No. lvi.) and may be entitled:

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_71">p. 71</span>

<span id="page_71_note_1"></span>[1](#page_71_fr_1.md) This section is the
most difficult of all to translate owing to the abundance of technical
fishing terms. In spite of marvellous philological industry and
wide-flung enquiries L. has been unable to identify a number of words.

<span id="page_71_note_2"></span>[2](#page_71_fr_2.md) *Sc*. the faithful.

<span id="footnotes_page_72">p. 72</span>

<span id="page_72_note_1"></span>[1](#page_72_fr_1.md) *Sc*. the Seven.

<span id="page_72_note_2"></span>[2](#page_72_fr_2.md) Lit. 'on the high
seas' L. glosses this as meaning that they are not river fish; but this
seems to me unnecessary, as my rendering suggests.

<span id="page_72_note_3"></span>[3](#page_72_fr_3.md) Used apparently by
the fish-seller for advertising his wares.

<span id="footnotes_page_73">p. 73</span>

<span id="page_73_note_1"></span>[1](#page_73_fr_1.md) Evidently a
wind-instrument of some kind.

<span id="page_73_note_2"></span>[2](#page_73_fr_2.md) Presumably a
water-bird.

<span id="page_73_note_3"></span>[3](#page_73_fr_3.md) *Sc*. to dry in the
sun.

<span id="footnotes_page_74">p. 74</span>

<span id="page_74_note_1"></span>[1](#page_74_fr_1.md) K. is the infernal
river which the souls have to cross after death; its waters are figured
as dragons and its waves as scorpions (§ 51). Ulai is also a river. If
it is in any way connected with the Eulæus from which the Kings of
Persia are fabled to have drunk, the sense is hard to find. It is more
probably an infernal stream, at any rate one from which the evil fishers
drank.

<span id="footnotes_page_76">p. 76</span>

<span id="page_76_note_1"></span>[1](#page_76_fr_1.md) Uncertain. Père
Anastase of Baghdad informs L. that now-a-days a bell is attached to the
rudder-bar; but here it seems to have some connection with the axe.

<span id="footnotes_page_77">p. 77</span>

<span id="page_77_note_1"></span>[1](#page_77_fr_1.md) L. suggests so as to
seek the spawning places or in order to hide themselves.

<span id="page_77_note_2"></span>[2](#page_77_fr_2.md) The numerous gaps
which have to be left owing to uncertainty of translation make a number
of the above sentences unintelligible. The concluding paragraphs are
presumably an allegory of the attractions of false religions, and can
hardly be thought to be part of the speech of the fishers.

<span id="page_77_note_3"></span>[3](#page_77_fr_3.md) Presumably as the
waves made by the foundering ships reach the shore.

<span id="footnotes_page_78">p. 78</span>

<span id="page_78_note_1"></span>[1](#page_78_fr_1.md) The Mandæan colour
is white.

<span id="page_78_note_2"></span>[2](#page_78_fr_2.md) In the M. text, 146,
12, this is given as Sidmā. L. thinks it is a water-fowl of some kind.

<span id="page_78_note_3"></span>[3](#page_78_fr_3.md) Presumably because
it is always diving after its prey.

<span id="page_78_note_4"></span>[4](#page_78_fr_4.md) *Sc*. the Seven.

<span id="footnotes_page_79">p. 79</span>

<span id="page_79_note_1"></span>[1](#page_79_fr_1.md) *Sc*. to frighten
the fish into the nets.

<span id="page_79_note_2"></span>[2](#page_79_fr_2.md) The Jordan-Watchers.

<span id="footnotes_page_80">p. 80</span>

<span id="page_80_note_1"></span>[1](#page_80_fr_1.md) Bait of some kind
presumably.

<span id="page_80_note_2"></span>[2](#page_80_fr_2.md) Detailing probably
the remaining two of the four objects referred to.

<span id="footnotes_page_81">p. 81</span>

<span id="page_81_note_1"></span>[1](#page_81_fr_1.md) The salt, bitter,
water of the sea of death and destruction, as opposed to the fresh,
sweet water, the living water or water of Life.

<span id="page_81_note_2"></span>[2](#page_81_fr_2.md) Equating with the
Heavenly Jordan.

<span id="page_81_note_3"></span>[3](#page_81_fr_3.md) All symbolic objects
in the cult.

<span id="page_81_note_4"></span>[4](#page_81_fr_4.md) *Sc*. the knife or
sword of the Angel of Death.

<span id="footnotes_page_82">p. 82</span>

<span id="page_82_note_1"></span>[1](#page_82_fr_1.md) This may mean at a
certain period or appointed time.

<span id="page_82_note_2"></span>[2](#page_82_fr_2.md) The faithful are
figured as birds as well as sheep.

<span id="page_82_note_3"></span>[3](#page_82_fr_3.md) An untranslatable
idiom.

<span id="page_82_note_4"></span>[4](#page_82_fr_4.md) *Sc*. of this world.

<span id="page_82_note_5"></span>[5](#page_82_fr_5.md) That is, the living
water.

<span id="page_82_note_6"></span>[6](#page_82_fr_6.md) This is conjectural.

<span id="footnotes_page_83">p. 83</span>

<span id="page_83_note_1"></span>[1](#page_83_fr_1) Lidzbarski (p. 465.md)
thinks this refers to the Moslim period. Elsewhere we find the parallel
phrase 'age of Bizbat,' which L. also refers to Muhammad. But Bizbat is
clearly a corrupt form of Baal-Zebul, and therefore the reference should
be more general.

<span id="page_83_note_2"></span>[2](#page_83_fr_2.md) Presumably stars.

<span id="footnotes_page_84">p. 84</span>

<span id="page_84_note_1"></span>[1](#page_84_fr_1) Spirit or jinn (?.md)

<span id="footnotes_page_85">p. 85</span>

<span id="page_85_note_1"></span>[1](#page_85_fr_1.md) A still more
degraded form of cult is mentioned, but the meaning baffles the
translator; it is referred to those who bow down before Rūhā, here in
mockery called 'Holy' Spirit.

<span id="page_85_note_2"></span>[2](#page_85_fr_2.md) The above is
obscure, especially the 'pen-demon' reference. The general sense.
however, seems to be that those who fall away from the Mandæan faith are
not to be restrained by force, but let go their way.

<span id="page_85_note_3"></span>[3](#page_85_fr_3.md) *Sc*. Life. The
concluding paragraph runs on without break in the German, being assigned
to the same speaker; but the subject is clearly changed and the whole
spirit is different. The Good Shepherd now seeks for the lost sheep and
does not leave it to perish.

<span id="footnotes_page_86">p. 86</span>

<span id="page_86_note_1"></span>[1](#page_86_fr_1.md) In § 9 ([p.
39](gjb-2-1.htm#page_39).md) N. is called the Watcher who has his station
in every region, *i.e.* the Great Watcher.

<span id="footnotes_page_87">p. 87</span>

<span id="page_87_note_1"></span>[1](#page_87_fr_1.md) Y. is the Helper or
Saviour. The shekīnah or celestial abode of Yawar, the Chosen, is the
Home of the Blessed (*cp*. J.B. 189<span class="small">4</span>).

<span id="footnotes_page_90">p. 90</span>

<span id="page_90_note_1"></span>[1](#page_90_fr_1.md) *Kannā*. L. leaves
this technical term untranslated; but in note 4 to p. 4 he shows that it
frequently means a wine-cup or wine-bowl. I would therefore venture to
connect it with the widespread notion of the *kratēr* or mixing-bowl of
souls as handed on, for instance, by Plato in the Timæus, presumably
from Hither Asian sources. One of the treatises of the *Corpus
Hermeticum* is called 'The Cup' or 'The Bowl,' or alternatively 'The
Monad.' It was not only the source of souls, but also the Mind into
which they had to be dowsed for spiritual baptism or regeneration.

<span id="page_90_note_2"></span>[2](#page_90_fr_2.md) Presumably the rays
of glory, signifying a state of contemplation.

<span id="page_90_note_3"></span>[3](#page_90_fr_3.md) The supernal powers.

<span id="page_90_note_4"></span>[4](#page_90_fr_4.md) I can find no
explanation of this occasionally recurring figure; it indubitably goes
back to some ancient myth.

<span id="footnotes_page_91">p. 91</span>

<span id="page_91_note_1"></span>[1](#page_91_fr_1.md) In a number of the
Gnostic systems of the Early Christian period the body of the first man
is said to lie like a log till the light-spark is breathed into him.

<span id="page_91_note_2"></span>[2](#page_91_fr_2.md) *Sc*. the heavenly
powers.

<span id="page_91_note_3"></span>[3](#page_91_fr_3.md) Presumably Adam

<span id="footnotes_page_92">p. 92</span>

<span id="page_92_note_1"></span>[1](#page_92_fr_1.md) The region of the
lower world-rulers.

<span id="footnotes_page_93">p. 93</span>

<span id="page_93_note_1"></span>[1](#page_93_fr_1.md) Or "One of the Poor
am I," Compare the Ebionīm or Poor of early Christianity; the Poor
(spiritually) are those who have voluntarily renounced this world's
goods.
