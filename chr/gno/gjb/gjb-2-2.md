above eloquent invitation to return the similar motive in the Talmūd
Jesus stories: (1) "When King Jannai directed the destruction of the
Rabbis. R. Joshua ben Perachiah and Jeshu went to Alexandria. When
security returned, R. Simeon ben Shetach sent him a letter to this
effect: From me, Jerusalem the holy city, to thee, Alexandria in Egypt,
my sister. My spouse tarries in thee, and I dwell desolate'" (*Bab.
Sandedrim*, 107b, *Sota*, 47a). (2) "The inhabitants of Jerusalem
intended to appoint Jehuda ben Tabbai as Nasi \[Prince or President of
the Sanhedrim\] in Jerusalem. He fled and went away to Alexandria, and
the inhabitants of Jerusalem wrote: 'From Jerusalem the Great to
Alexandria the Little: How long lives my betrothed with thee, whilst I
am sitting grieving for him?'" (*Pal. Chagiga*, 77d). See my *D. J. L.
100 B.C.?*—pp. 137ff., 148ff.—for a discussion of these passages. Can
Tabbai possibly in any way connect with the Ṭāb-Yōmīn of the
Portents-piece § 18 {[p. 35](gjb-2-1.md)}?

<span id="page_69_note_3"></span>[3](#page_69_fr_3.md) Cp. L.'s note (p.
114<sup>2</sup>), referring to the above-quoted (p. 68, n. 2) Talmūd
passage (1), where the same bowing down is recorded of Jeshu, namely:
"he set up a brick-bat and worshipped it." L. again prefers to render
the two words here as 'vault' simply. The Talmūd puzzle has never been
solved; but the passage of the J. B. above ([p.
55](gjb-2-1.htm#page_55).md) connects it with a coffin, and strongly
suggests an Egyptian atmosphere. Cp. now what Josephus (*Antiqq*. I.
ii.; Cory's *An. Fragg*. pp. 171, 172), Hebraïzing the Egyptian
tradition, says of the Sons of Sēth ( = Sōthis = Sirius), how "they made
two \[kinds of\] monuments, one of brick and the other of stone, and on
each engraved their discoveries." This passage is from Manetho's lost
work *Sothis*, on the authenticity of which and its implications, I
would refer the reader to my lengthy researches in *Thrice-greatest
Hermes*, i. 99-127: the above passage will be found on p. 114. From this
I would venture to suggest that the Talmūd charge against Jeshu of
learning 'magic' in Egypt is reflected in the queer term 'brick-bat' or
'bricking.' According to Manetho's legend or tradition the most ancient
lore of the priests, of the period of the First Thoth or Hermes, before
the Flood, was preserved in the most primitive brick pyramids. The
pyramids were originally tombs. That my suggested version is in the
right direction is borne out by the following sentence of the text:
"They shall be buried in the Darkness."

figure, appearing frequently in Manichæism. In the Christianized Gnosis
it is the technical term for the unripe birth from Achamōth, the Wisdom
Without. For the most interesting echo in the N.T. cp. Paul's famous
utterance: "And last of all he appeared unto me also, as unto 'the
Abortion'"—*sc*. of whom you have all heard.

ironical = "who thought that ye were not of this world."

believed that the destruction of Jerusalem was a retribution for the
persecution of their community.
