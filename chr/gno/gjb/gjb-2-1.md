### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_35">p. 35</span>

<span id="page_35_note_1"></span>[1](#page_35_fr_1.md) Because Yōhānā is
mentioned only once in the *Genzā*, Brandt supposes that the John-Book
pieces must be later in date. But surely this is not a scientific
conjecture. It is rather to be supposed that the John-pieces were
naturally gathered together from the general mass of material when the
collection-process began. Though Yahyā is the Arabic form of the name,
Yōhānā alternates with it; this shows a later redaction in the
Mohammedan period, when the people vulgarly spoke Arabic, but says
nothing as to the date of earlier writings from which the pieces were
copied out.

<span id="page_35_note_2"></span>[2](#page_35_fr_2.md) *Ur-ashlam*, a
mock-name or derisive caricature-permutation = 'Ur perfected' it. Ur is
originally the Chaldæan Deus Lunus; he is the eldest son of Rūhā, the
World-Mother, and corresponds in some respects with the Yaldabaōth of
'Ophite' gnosticism.

<span id="page_35_note_3"></span>[3](#page_35_fr_3.md) Who it was is not
disclosed. The dreamer's report is at first utterly discredited.

<span id="page_35_note_4"></span>[4](#page_35_fr_4.md) The Elizabeth of
Luke. The name may be some mystical echo of Elisheba, the wife of Aaron,
the first priest, just as the Miriam of the Jesus birth-story reminds us
of Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Moses, the first prophet. If the
pre-Christian Palestinian Dorshē Reshumōth may be thought incapable of
going so far, the Alexandrian Jewish allegorists, to whose school Philo
belonged, would, and did, sublimate the sister or wife of a sage into a
figure of his spiritual virtue or power. This will become clearer later
on.

<span id="page_35_note_5"></span>[5](#page_35_fr_5.md) The Zacharias of
Luke.

<span id="page_35_note_6"></span>[6](#page_35_fr_6.md) Cp. the more
concrete three Magi motive. It should, however, be noted that Origen
(1st half of 3rd cent.) is the first of the Fathers to state that the
number of the Magi was 3; Chrysostom, 150 years later, gives their
number as 12 (see Lynn Thorndike, *A History of Magic and Experimental
Science* London, 1923, i. 472ff.).

<span id="footnotes_page_36">p. 36</span>

<span id="page_36_note_1"></span>[1](#page_36_fr_1.md) Merkabah; here
presumably meaning heaven generally.

<span id="page_36_note_2"></span>[2](#page_36_fr_2.md) The narrative is
largely in the familiar style of Danielic and Talmūdic chronological
camouflage; the Daniel Book (*c*. 164 B.C.) throws back the
religio-political conflict of the Jews with the kingdorn and Hellenistic
religion of Antiochus Epiphanes to the days of Nebuchhadnezzar (*c*. 600
B.C.), and the Talmūd Jesus stories, for instance, throw back the
setting to some 100 years B.C. or advance it to some 100 years A.D. See
my *Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?—An Enquiry into the Talmūd-Jesus Stories,
the Toldoth Jushu and Some Curious Statements of Epiphanius—Being a
Contribution to the Study of Christian Origins* (London, 1903). It is to
be noted that the Talmūd knows nothing of John; it evidently regards the
John-Jesus movement as one and the same kind of heresy. Y. and B. may
perhaps be personified types of members of certain contemporary
communities or mystical groups. In §54 Y. and B. are called the 'Two
Gold-sons.' This reminds us of alchemical symbolism; see my tracing of
'psychical' alchemy to Babylon in *The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in
Western Tradition* (London, 1919), Proem, pp. 25ff. They may have
belonged to the early 'Sons of the Sun' tradition—the later Sampsæans of
Epiphanius, still later in wider distribution known to the Moslim
historians as Shemsīyeh (Shamish = the Sun). This hypothesis is
strengthened by the apparently cryptic gloss Beni-Amin, 'Sons of (the)
Amēn' (cp. Rev. iii. 14: These things saith the Amēn, the faithful and
true witness, the beginning of the creation of God."). I have no space
here to follow up this conjecture; but L. seems to me to be, not only
nodding, but fast asleep, when he assumes that the Mandæan writers were
simply ignoramuses who mistook Ben-Yamin for Beni-Amin. The Heb.
derivation of Benjamin is given very variously In the Apocrypha and
Pseudepigrapha of the O.T. L. refers to Yaqif (clearly Jacob) as Joseph.

<span id="page_36_note_3"></span>[3](#page_36_fr_3.md) Of whom we have no
further information.

<span id="page_36_note_4"></span>[4](#page_36_fr_4.md) Can this be
camouflage for Rabbi Eliazer ben Hyrcanus, the founder of the famous
Rabbinical school at Lud (Lydda) and teacher of Akiba? He flourished
70-100 A.D. R. Eliazer was imprisoned for heresy; the Talmūd account
connects this accusation of heresy with an interview between him and a
certain Jacob of Kephar Sechania, a city in lower Galilee, who is said
to have been one of the disciples of Jeshu ha-Notzri, *i.e.* J. the
Nāzōræan (see *D.J.L. 100 B.C.?*—pp. 216 ff. for reference and
discussion). But Eliazer is a name of great distinction in Pharisaic
priestly tradition, especially that of the Maccabæan proto-martyr
priest, the teacher of the martyred Seven Sons and the Mother in IV.
*Maccabees*.

<span id="footnotes_page_37">p. 37</span>

<span id="page_37_note_1"></span>[1](#page_37_fr_1.md) Unidentified by L.
Can it be camouflage for Tabbai, father of R. Jehuda, who was 'pair' to
Simeon ben Shetach, in the Pal. Talmūd Jesus-story (*Chag*. 77d), see
Mead, *op. cit.*, pp. 148f.

<span id="page_37_note_2"></span>[2](#page_37_fr_2.md) The source of E.'s
inspiration is the Earth; the source of John's is the Sun (see below
§20—[p. 43](#page_43).md).

<span id="page_37_note_3"></span>[3](#page_37_fr_3.md) This is most
probably Elijah (the Eliyahū of the O.T.); I owe this illuminating
conjecture to Dr. M. Gaster. Is there here also a hidden reference to an
existing 'School of the Prophets'?

<span id="footnotes_page_38">p. 38</span>

<span id="page_38_note_1"></span>[1](#page_38_fr_1.md) This is the same
motive as that in the Talmūd Jesus-stories and Toldoth. It is the
language of popular, Bazaar theological controversy, and is in keeping
with Jewish figurative diction in which 'fornication' is the general
term for all lapses from right religious beliefs and views.

<span id="page_38_note_2"></span>[2](#page_38_fr_2.md) ? in vision.

<span id="page_38_note_3"></span>[3](#page_38_fr_3.md) Moses, son of
'Amram.

<span id="page_38_note_4"></span>[4](#page_38_fr_4.md) Elsewhere we learn
that Zakhriā was 99 and Enishbai 88 at John's birth and that John
himself began his ministry at the age of 22. A mystic psephology is here
clearly employed.

<span id="footnotes_page_39">p. 39</span>

<span id="page_39_note_1"></span>[1](#page_39_fr_1.md) *Sc*. the race of
the righteous, of the spiritual or perfect. It has many names in
mystical literature of the first centuries, as for instance in Philo,
who distinguishes 'race' and 'kin' of God from 'people' of God. See for
references and quotations my *Thrice-greatest Hermes* (London, 1906),
Index *s.v.* 'Race.'

<span id="page_39_note_2"></span>[2](#page_39_fr_2.md) The same mystic idea
underlies the words of Philo about the women Therapeuts (*D.V.C.*):
"Their longing is not for mortal children, but for a deathless progeny
which the soul that is in love with God can alone bring forth." See my
translation in *Fragments of a Faith Forgotten* (London, 2nd ed., 1906),
p. 75. It is the Melchisedec motive also.

<span id="footnotes_page_40">p. 40</span>

<span id="page_40_note_1"></span>[1](#page_40_fr_1.md) The prophets are
god-sons of their god-parents; father and son are the usual terms for
the relationship between master and pupil in sacred things.

heavenly messengers.

<span id="page_40_note_3"></span>[3](#page_40_fr_3.md) The Heavenly Man of
Light. The Man-doctrine is an essential element of the Gnosis, as it was
also with Jesus. ('Son of Man' is the Aramæan idiom for 'Man' simply.)
See Reitzenstein's *Poimandres* (Leipzig, 1904), my *Thrice-greatest
Hermes* (1906), and Bousset, *op. cit.* (1907), indexes.

<span id="page_40_note_4"></span>[4](#page_40_fr_4.md) This introductory
formula, as is the case with other headings and conclusions, is due to
the collectors and editors. It is unexplained, but seems to refer to the
dark period before the dawn of the Day of Light which was expected. The
days of *this* age are spiritual nights. *N.B.* (a prophet 'proclaims,'
he does not 'preach.'

<span id="page_40_note_5"></span>[5](#page_40_fr_5.md) This-World-rulers or

<span id="page_41_note_1"></span>[1](#page_41_fr_1.md) A technical term—the
things that 'fall short' as compared with the 'fulness' of perfection;
cp. the plērōma and hysterēma of numerous Greek Gnostic documents.

<span id="page_41_note_2"></span>[2](#page_41_fr_2.md) Brandt (Art.
*E.R.E.*) apologetically conjectures that this observance of Sun-day
(*hab šabbā*) was taken over from Syro-Christian usage. But reverence
for Sun-day is fundamental with the MM., and it is one of their
celestial personifications. The MM. loathed idolatry and sun-worship;
they worshipped Life and Light, but may have venerated the light as the
symbol of that Light. The same puzzle occurs with the prayer-custom of
the Essenes, who turned to the rising sun in their morning orisons. The
problem we have here to face is the existence of a pre-Christian Sun-day
as rigidly observed as the Jews and others kept the Sabbath, and not a
'Pagan' holy-day.

Cosmic Animal-life Circle or Zodiac, which were held by the MM. to be
equally inimical with the Seven. Both orders were sons of the
World-mother Namrūs, generally called Rūhā, *i.e.* Spirit, the
World-spirit, spirit here being used in the wide-spread sense of the
lower, animal spirit.

Man or Adam of Light.

<span id="page_41_note_7"></span>[7](#page_41_fr_7.md) Rām the Great,

The first age or world-period was that of Adam; the second, of Rām and
Rūd (fem.); the third, of Shurbai and Sharhab-ēl; the fourth, that of
the Flood. The second generation perished by the sword and pestilence,
the third by fire (cp. § 25 [below](#page_45).md). The Indian *yugas* came
from the same source. As to the prophetica1 vesture in this special
connection, apart from the more general wide-spread notion of the
garment of light or robe of glory, cp. the Rabbinical tradition in the
mediæval *Yaschar* or *Sepher Hai-yaschar* (*The Book of the Just*, more
commonly known as *The Book of the Generations of Adam* or *The Book of
the History of Man*) which contains ancient material, translated into
French by Chevalier P. L. B. Drach: "After the death of Adam and Eve the
coats \[*sc*. of skin—see R. Eisler's brilliant conjecture that J. the
B. outwardly assumed his camel's hair robe in memory of the first
garments of the fallen protoplasts, as a sign of repentance, in the
preceding study\] were given to Enoch, son of Jared. Enoch, at the time
of his being taken to God, gave them to his son Methusaleh. After the
death of Methusaleh, Noah took them and hid them in the Ark. Ham stole
them, and hid them so successfully that his brethren were unable to find
them. Ham gave them secretly to his eldest son, Chus, who made a mystery
of it to his brothers and sons. When Nimrod \[ = Zoroaster, see Bousset,
*op. cit.*, index\] reached the age of 20 years, he (Chus) clothed him
with the vesture, which gave him extraordinary strength" Migne, *Dic.
des Apocryphes*, ii. 1102, 1150; and see my *World-Mystery* (London, 2nd
ed., 1907), § 'The Soul-Vestures,' pp. 115ff.). It would not be
difficult to penetrate under the *camouflage* of the Rabbinic tradition,
but space does not serve.

cp. the miraculous spiritual outpouring of the Last Days expected by
John, based on O.T. prophecies, as set forth in the previous
introductory study; also one of the *Odes of Solomon*, quoted in the
*Pistis Sophia* (ch. 65, pag. 131, Mead p. 110): "A stream came forth
and became a great wide flood. It tore away all to itself and turned
itself against the temple," etc. The whole Ode is most instructive in
this connection, and the Odes in general move in a very similar
atmosphere to the John-lore. (See for Trans. from Syriac, Rendel Harris
and Mingana, *The Odes and Psalms of Solomon*, Manchester, 1920). The
'fish' and 'birds' of the next sentences are the faithful.

retains this as a proper name—*e.g.* 'in the Tibil'—and alternates it
with the common noun 'world.' Whether there is a distinction in the

world, earth). Where L. has Tibil, I shall render it by 'this world.'

<span id="page_46_note_3"></span>[3](#page_46_fr_3.md) Kushṭā is the
general term for the religious ideal of the MM.; it is elastic in
meaning and cannot be translated by a single rigid concept. The original
sense seems to have been 'Truth,' 'Righteousness' and perhaps 'Order'
(cp. the Avestan Asha and the Vedic Ṛita). It thus means the true
religion, loyalty, trust and faith (see J.B. xvii.f.). Kushtā is fem. It
is to be noted that in Avestan literature Ashi (fem.) is the heavenly
impersonation of rectitude, fortune, chastity, riches (cp. *ūthrā's*),
and Chisti (fem.) of religious wisdom (? = gnōsis)—see M. N. Dhalla,

With the frequent recurrence of the letter-symbol in M. scripture, cp.
the Syriac 'Hymn of the Soul,' or 'of the Pearl,' which belengs to the
same main stream of the Gnosis (see my *Hymn of the Robe of Glory*,
'Echoes from the Gnosis' series, vol. x., London, 1908).

<span id="page_47_note_4"></span>[4](#page_47_fr_4.md) Ṣúfis would at once
conclude that this refers to the Dīvān, the nightly Meeting of the
Perfect in spirit presided over by the Quṭb (Pillar or Axis), the Head
of the age. Mt. Karmel is identified with the story of Elijah and has
always continued to be a sacred mount. Doubtless communities of 'Sons of
the Prophets' and the rest had coutinuously there their retreats. Can it
be that Ṭāb Yōmīn went to Mt. Karmel to find Lilyukh (Eli-yahu)? Karmel
= the Garden or Garden-land. It had been a sacred spot long before the
days of Elijah, who hid there from his pursuors in its numerous grottos.
The Arabs still call it Jebal Mar Elyas (Mount Lord Elijah). Yamblichus
in his *Life* of the sage says that Pythagoras visited it.

taken over from the Christians, as Brandt supposes.

Perachiah Jesus story in the Talmūd (*B. Sanhedrin* 107b, *Sota* 47a):

<span id="page_50_note_3"></span>[3](#page_50_fr_3.md) L. thinks that by
zanḍīq (heretic) is meant a Zoroastrian or Manichæan who comes down from
the mountains to join the Mandæans who live in the plains. This seems to
me entirely mistaken. The Z.'s and M.'s lived as well on plains as on
mountains. In every probability it means the Mount of Darkness on which
the Seven assemble to plot against the righteous. The Seven are the
lords of all the false religions. For the Mount of Hades, the Prison
Mount of the Underworld in Bab. tradition, see my paper 'New-found
Fragments of a Babylonian Mystery-play and the Passion-story,' *Quest*,

<span id="page_51_note_2"></span>[2](#page_51_fr_2.md) *Sc*. of light; cp.
the great light that shone on Jordan at the baptizing of Jesus in 'The
Gospel according to the Hebrews,' Tatian's *Diatessaron* (Syriac, 2nd
half of 2nd cent.) also preserves this feature. Bar Ṣalibi ({d.} 1171)
glosses this as follows: "And immediately, as the Gospel of the
Diatessaron testifies, a mighty light flashed upon Jordan and the river
was girdled with white clouds, and there appeared his many hosts that
were uttering praise in the air; and Jordan stood still from its
flowing, though its waters were not troubled, and a pleasant odour
therefrom was wafted." There is a strong Mandæan flavour about this
gloss, which doubtless rested on early tradition. See F. C. Burkitt,
*Evangelion da-Mepharreshe* (Cambridge, 1904), ii. 115. This is the
Christian and not the M. 'cross,' as *e.g.* used in the baptismal
ceremony, which is made of a number of long sticks or wands, the ends of
which are stuck in the ground and the tops crossed one over the other to
represent rays of light.

<span id="page_51_note_3"></span>[3](#page_51_fr_3.md) The Jordan is white
for the MM.; the various colours signify heresies.

<span id="page_51_note_4"></span>[4](#page_51_fr_4.md) L. thinks that this
stands for Paul, and this is very probably so. But at the same time he
informs us that 'Paulus,' as Lorsback has shewn, is the equivalent of a
Persian word meaning 'Deceiver.' It therefore may mean simply the
Messiah Deceiver.

<span id="page_51_note_5"></span>[5](#page_51_fr_5.md) Evidently a 'font.'

<span id="page_53_note_2"></span>[2](#page_53_fr_2.md) This is unexplained,
Lidzbarski thinks it means three births; but more probably it means
three hours for sleep and three hours for prayer, and three again
repeated.

<span id="page_53_note_4"></span>[4](#page_53_fr_4.md) That is, those

Kushṭā. She is thus the personified Mother of the wife of Yahyā.

<span id="page_53_note_5"></span>[5](#page_53_fr_5.md) These are elsewhere
mostly names of heavenly beings and are in part to be paralleled with
the children of Eve (Hawwā) in the *Genzā* (R. 108). Handan is otherwise
unknown. Shar-rath may be Shar. who is elsewhere called "the great,
hidden First Vine, who bears a thousand times a thousand fruits and ten
thousand times ten thousand shoots." Bihrām is a later form of the
Avestan Verethragna; he is generally called 'the Great.' R'himath-Haiyē
= the Living or Life's R. In the *Qolastā* or Liturgies there is a
R'hum-Hai twice mentioned; he is 'Life's Beloved,' one of the four Sons
of Light, or alternately of Salvation. Nṣab is elsewhere (§ 4, 8) called
N. Zīwā, that is Radiant N.; he is regarded as the Great Watcher (§ 9),
and his name means 'Planter,' 'Fashioner.' Sām is also called S.-Haiyē.
S. the Living; he too is 'Watcher of the æons' (G. R. 313, 12ff.), and
his name means 'Stablisher.' Anhar-Zīwā or the Radiant A. is feminine
(cp. § 69, 7); Anhar is elsewhere called the 'Hidden Light,' and her
name means 'Lightener.' Can she then have any connection with the Iexai
or Yechai, the complement of Elxai (the 'Hidden Power'), mentioned by
Epiphanius? The muddled-up account of the Eschasæans in the
heresiological Fathers seems to me to have a close connection with the
Mandæan notions (see my *D. J. L. 100 B.C.?*—ch. xviii, 'Concerning the
Book of Elxai,' pp. 365-387 (London, 1903), and Brandt's study,
*Elchasai: ein Religionsstifter und sein Werk* (Leipzig, 1912). The
second Sherrath is evidently a doublet.

<span id="footnotes_page_54">p. 54</span>

<span id="page_55_note_2"></span>[2](#page_55_fr_2.md) It was the popular
custom apparently, which, however, the Mandæans did not follow, when a
woman was in labour, to ring a bell to ward off evil influences (cp. the
Egyptian sistrum); and a picture (or pantacle) also, with a similar
apotropaic purpose, was painted. If the birth was successful, a
birth-feast was given. It was also the custom, when bride and groom were
poor, for their friends to borrow money or to bail for the expenses of
the wedding-festivities.

<span id="page_55_note_3"></span>[3](#page_55_fr_3.md) L. prefers to
translate this as 'vault,' but he seems to me to miss the meaning and
that too in face of his own note, where he admits that the first word
simply means 'brick.'

<span id="page_55_note_4"></span>[4](#page_55_fr_4.md) Both references seem
to refer to Egyptian motives in burial customs. For the extraordinarily
interesting deduction to be made from this hint in connection with a
striking phrase in one of the following Miryai-pieces (§ 35) see the

<span id="page_57_note_4"></span>[4](#page_57_fr_4) *Uthra* (*ūtrā*.md) is
a frequently occurring general term in Mandæan, of which the precise
meaning has not yet been determined; L. leaves it untranslated. *Uthra*
means literally 'Riches,' 'Wealth'; and may very well then stand for the
notion of Treasure. It might even convey the idea of Fulness (Gk.
*Plērōma*), but this is hazardous. The difficulty with Treasure is that
there are also two technical M. terms for Treasure, Treasury or
Treasure-house (*sc*. of Life, cp. § 57, forewords). *Uthra* seems
sometimes to equate with Angel; but again this has a term for itself
(*malaka*). In any case it means a heavenly or spiritual being,
excarnate or incarnate, and therefore the phrase signifies the Heavenly
or Spiritual Enoch. See L.'s dissertation. '*Uthra und Malaka*,' in
*Orientalische Studien Theodor Nöldtke zum siebzigsten Geburtstag (12
Marz, 1906) gewidmet* (Giesgen, 1906), pp. 537-545.

threat of killing and the removal of the child the 'Slaughter of the
Innocents' and the 'Flight into Egypt' motives of the parallel Chriatian
stories. The 'little ones' is elsewhere found frequently in Mandæan as a
technicnl term for the initiates of the community. The sacred drink, the
*mambūhā* of the M. 'eucharist,' doubtless throws back to the
Mazda-yasnian *haōma*. Parwan is mentioned only in this passage. It may,
however, be a clerical error; for occasionally mention is made of a land
called the 'pure Tarwan.' Or is it Mt. Karmel?

<span id="page_57_note_6"></span>[6](#page_57_fr_6.md) The numbers 99, 88,
and 22 seem to belong to some system of mystic psephology, Or *gematria*
as the Kabbalists afterwards called it. Cp. the 888 value of the name of
Christ in the second-century system of the Gnostic Markos and the 666 of
the Beast in the Apacalypse. I would suggest, though with hesitation,
that 10's, l00's and 1000's represent 'powers,' *i.e.* so-called higher
or wider planes of activity or development, and digits certain
fundamental characteristics. In this connection it is of interest to
note that such numbers as 1111, 2222, occur in classical Pythagorean
psephology.

<span id="footnotes_page_58">p. 58</span>

<span id="page_58_note_1"></span>[1](#page_58_fr_1.md) This is a reference

(p. 115; Mead<sup>2</sup>, p. 97), where Jesus is made to say to his

Great Mother\], according to matter, and hast received likeness which is
in the Virgin of Light, according to light . . . ; and on thy account
the darkness hath arisen, and moreover out of thee did come forth the
material body in which I am, which I have purified and refined." Again
(p. 120; M. p. 100): "Mary, my mother according to matter, thou in whom
I have sojourned." And again, Mary speaking (p. 120; M. p. 103): "'Grace
and Truth met together,'—it is I, Mary, thy mother, and Elizabeth,
mother of John, whom I have met. 'Grace' then is the power of Sabaōth in
me, which went forth out of me, which thou art. . . . . 'Truth' on the
other hand is the power in Elizabeth, which is John, who did come and
hath made proclamation concerning the way of Truth \[the M. Kushṭā\]
which thou art,—who hath made proclamation before thee."
