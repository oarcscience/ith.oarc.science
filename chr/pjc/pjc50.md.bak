# CHAPTER XXXVI

### Jesus on Mount Golgotha.--Sixth and seventh Falls of Jesus.

THE procession again moved on; the road was very steep and rough between
the walls of the town and Calvary, and Jesus had the greatest difficulty
in walking with his heavy burden on his shoulders; but his cruel
enemies, far from feeling the slightest compassion, or giving the least
assistance, continued to urge him on by the infliction of hard blows,
and the utterance of dreadful curses. At last they reached a. spot where
the pathway turned suddenly to the south; here he stumbled and fell for
the sixth time. The fall was a dreadful one, but the guards only struck
him the harder to force him to get up, and no sooner did he reach
Calvary than he sank down again for the seventh time.

Simon of Cyrene was filled with indignation and pity; notwithstanding
his fatigue, he wished to remain that he might assist Jesus, but the
archers first reviled, and then drove him away, and he soon after joined
the body of disciples. The executioners then ordered the workmen and the
boys who had carried the instruments for the execution to depart, and
the Pharisees soon arrived, for they were on horseback, and had taken
the smooth and easy road which ran to the east of Calvary. There was a
fine view of the whole town of Jerusalem from the top of Calvary. This
top was circular, and about the size of an ordinary riding-school,
surrounded by a low wall, and with five separate entrances. This
appeared to be the usual number in those parts, for there were five
roads at the baths, at the place where they baptised, at the pool of
Bethsaida, and there were likewise many towns with five gates. In this,
as in many other peculiarities of the Holy Land, there was a deep
prophetic signification; that number five, which so often occurred, was
a type of those five sacred wounds of our Blessed Saviour, which were to
open to us the gates of Heaven.

The horsemen stopped on the west side of the mount,

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

where the declivity was not so steep; for the side up which the
criminals were brought was both rough and steep. About a hundred
soldiers were, stationed on different parts of the mountain, and as
space was required, the thieves were not brought to the top, but ordered
to halt before they reached it, and to lie on the ground with their arms
fastened to their crosses. Soldiers stood around and guarded them, while
crowds of persons who did not fear defiling themselves, stood near the
platform or on the neighbouring heights; these were mostly of the lower
classes--strangers, slaves, and pagans, and a number of them were women.

It wanted about a quarter to twelve when Jesus, loaded with his cross,
sank down at the precise spot where he was to be crucified. The
barbarous executioners dragged him up by the cords which they had
fastened round his waist, and then untied the arms of the cross, and
threw them on the ground. The sight of our Blessed Lord at this moment
was, indeed, calculated to move the hardest heart to compassion; he
stood or rather bent over the cross, being scarcely able to support
himself; his heavenly countenance was pale and wan as that of a person
on the verge of death, although wounds and blood disfigured it to a
frightful degree; but the hearts of these cruel men were, alas! harder
than iron itself, and far from showing the slightest commiseration, they
threw him brutally down, exclaiming in a jeering tone, 'Most powerful
king, we are about to prepare thy throne.' Jesus immediately placed
himself upon the cross, and they measured him and marked the places for
his feet and hands, whilst the Pharisees continued to insult their
unresisting Victim. When the measurement was finished, they led him to a
cave cut in the rock, which had been used formerly as a cellar, opened
the door, and pushed him in so roughly that had it not been for the
support of angels, his legs must have been broken by so hard a fall on
the rough stone floor. I most distinctly heard his groans of pain, but
they closed the door quickly, and placed guards before it, and the
archers continued their preparations for the crucifixion. The

centre of the platform mentioned above was the most elevated part of
Calvary,--it was a round eminence, about two feet high, and persons were
obliged to ascend two or three steps to reach its top. The executioners
dug the holes for the three crosses at the top of this eminence, and
placed those intended for the thieves one on the right and the other on
the left of our Lord's; both were lower and more roughly made than his.
They then carried the cross of our Saviour to the spot where they
intended to crucify him, and placed it in such a position that it would
easily fall into the hole prepared for it. They fastened the two arms
strongly on to the body of the cross, nailed the board at the bottom
which was to support the feet, bored the holes for the nails, and cut
different hollows in the wood in the parts which would receive the head
and back of our Lord, in order that his body might rest against the
cross, instead of being suspended from it. Their aim in this was the
prolongation of his tortures, for if the whole weight of his body was
allowed to fall upon the hands the holes might be quite torn open, and
death ensue more speedily than they desired. The executioners then drove
into the ground the pieces of wood which were intended to keep the cross
upright, and made a few other similar preparations.
