This is an account of the events leading up to the Crucifixion of Christ
by a 19th century German stigmatic and visionary, Anne Catherine
Emmerich. This once-obscure book recently achieved a much higher profile
because it was used as an inspiration for the screenplay of Mel Gibson's
controversial movie, The Passion of the Christ. A riveting 'you are
there' account of this pivotal event, the story is told with great
attention to small details, many not mentioned in the Gospels. This is
not a novelization; it is a recounting of Emmerich's ecstatic visions,
which were accompanied by painful and mysterious physical torments.
Emmerich was practically illiterate and this book was dictated by her,
which makes the fact that the narrative is so internally coherent all
the more compelling.

Some readers will note passages which by contemporary standards might be
considered anti-Semitic, particularly in the way that the Jewish
population is presented as having collective responsibility for the
death of Christ. Of course, without apologizing for this in the
slightest, it is to be noted that religious and secular institutions of
the time sanctioned anti-Semitism in one form or another, so this view
was not atypical. On the whole, however, the account considers each of
the numerous actors in the drama, Christian, Jewish, or Roman, as
individuals with particular motivations, strengths and weaknesses.

Emmerich was beatified on Sunday, October 3rd, 2004 by Pope John Paul
II, the final step before sainthood. Her feast day is the anniversary of
her death on February 9th, 1824.
