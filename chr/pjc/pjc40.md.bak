# CHAPTER XXVI.

### The Crowning with Thorns.

No sooner did Sister Emmerich recommence the narrative of her visions on
the Passion than she again became extremely ill, oppressed with fever,
and so tormented by violent thirst that her tongue was perfectly parched
and contracted; and on the Monday after Mid-Lent Sunday, she was so
exhausted that it was not without great difficulty, and after many
intervals of rest, that she narrated all which our Lord suffered in his
crowning with thorns. She was scarcely able to speak, because she
herself felt every sensation which she described in the following
account:

Pilate harangued the populace many times during the time of the
scourging of Jesus, but they interrupted him once, and vociferated, 'He
shall be executed, even if we die for it.' When Jesus was led into the
guard-house, they all cried out again, 'Crucify him, crucify him!'

After this there was silence for a time. Pilate occupied himself in
giving different orders to the soldiers, and the servants of the High
Priests brought them some refreshments; after which Pilate, whose
superstitious tendencies made him uneasy in mind, went into the inner
part of his palace in order to consult his gods, and to offer them
incense.

When the Blessed Virgin and the holy women had gathered up the blood of
Jesus, with which the pillar and the adjacent parts were saturated, they
left the forum, and went into a neighbouring small house, the owner of
which I do not know. John was not, I think, present at the scourging of
Jesus.

A gallery encircled the inner court of the guard-house where our Lord
was crowned with thorns, and the doors were open. The cowardly ruffians,
who were eagerly waiting to gratify their cruelty by torturing and
insulting our Lord, were about fifty in number, and the greatest part
slaves or servants of the jailers and soldiers. The mob gathered round
the building, but were soon displaced

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

by a thousand Roman soldiers, who were drawn up in good order and
stationed there. Although forbidden to leave their ranks, these soldiers
nevertheless did their utmost by laughter and applause to incite the
cruel executioners to redouble their insults; and as public applause
gives fresh energy to a comedian, so did their words of encouragement
increase tenfold the cruelty of these men.

In the middle of the court there stood the fragment of a pillar, and on
it was placed a very low stool which these cruel men maliciously covered
with sharp flints and bits of broken potsherds. Then they tore off the
garments of Jesus, thereby reopening all his wounds; threw over his
shoulders an old scarlet mantle which barely reached his knees; dragged
him to the seat prepared, and pushed him roughly down upon it, having
first placed the crown of thorns upon his head. The crown of thorns was
made of three branches plaited together, the greatest part of the thorns
being purposely turned inwards so as to pierce our Lord's head. Having
first placed these twisted branches on his forehead, they tied them
tightly together at the back of his head, and no sooner was this
accomplished to their satisfaction than they put a large reed into his
hand, doing all with derisive gravity as if they were really crowning
him king. They then seized the reed, and struck his head so violently
that his eyes were filled with blood; they knelt before him, derided
him, spat in his face, and buffeted him, saying at the same time,
'*Hail, King of the Jews*!' Then they threw down his stool, pulled him
up again from the ground on which he had fallen, and reseated him with
the greatest possible brutality.

It is quite impossible to describe the cruel outrages which were thought
of and perpetrated by these monsters under human form. The sufferings of
Jesus from thirst, caused by the fever which his wounds and sufferings
had brought on, were intense. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) He
trembled all over, his

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

flesh was torn piecemeal, his tongue contracted, and the only
refreshment he received was the blood which trickled from his head on to
his parched lips. This shameful scene was protracted a full half-hour,
and the Roman soldiers continued during the whole time to applaud and
encourage the perpetration of still greater outrages.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[221:1](pjc40.htm#fr_12.md) These meditations on
the sufferings of Jesus filled Sister Emmerich with such feelings of
compassion that she begged of God <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> to
allow her to suffer as he had done. She instantly became feverish and
parched with thirst, and, by morning, was speechless from the
contraction of her tongue and of her lips. She was in this state when
her friend came to her in the morning, and she looked like a victim
which had just been sacrificed. Those around succeeded, with some
difficulty, in moistening her mouth with a little water, but it was long
before she could give any further details concerning her meditations on
the Passion.
