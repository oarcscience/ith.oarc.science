# CHAPTER XXI.

### Jesus led back from the Court of Herod to that of Pilate.

THE enemies of Jesus were perfectly infuriated at being obliged to take
Jesus back, still uncondemned, to Pilate, who had so many times declared
his innocence. They led him round by a much longer road, in order in the
first place to let the persons of that part of the town see him in the
state of ignominy to which he was reduced, and in the second place to
give their emissaries more time to stir up the populace.

This road was extremely rough and uneven; and the soldiers, encouraged
by the Pharisees, scarcely refrained a moment from tormenting Jesus. The
long garment with which he was clothed impeded his steps, and caused him
to fall heavily more than once; and his cruel guards, as also many among
the brutal populace, instead of assisting him in his state of
exhaustion, endeavoured by blows and kicks to force him to rise.

To all these outrages Jesus offered not the smallest resistance; he
prayed constantly to his Father for grace and strength that he might not
sink under them, but accomplish the work of his Passion for our
redemption.

It was about eight o'clock when the procession reached the palace of
Pilate. The crowd was dense, and the Pharisees might be seen walking to
and fro, endeavouring to incite and infuriate them still more. Pilate,
who remembered an insurrection which had taken place the year before at
the Paschal time, had assembled upwards of a thousand soldiers, whom he
posted around the Prætorium, the Forum, and his palace.

The Blessed Virgin, her elder sister Mary (the daughter of Heli), Mary
(the daughter of Cleophas), Magdalen, and about twenty of the holy
women, were standing in a room from whence they could see all which took
place, and at first John was with them.

The Pharisees led Jesus, still clothed in the fool's garment, through
the midst of the insolent mob, and

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

had done all in their power to gather together the most vile and wicked
of miscreants from among the dregs of the people. A servant sent by
Herod had already reached Pilate, with a message to the effect that his
master had fully appreciated his polite deference to his opinion, but
that be looked upon the far-famed Galilæan as no better than a fool,
that he had treated him as such, and now sent him back. Pilate was quite
satisfied at finding that Herod had come to the same conclusion as
himself, and therefore returned a polite message. From that hour they
became friends, having been enemies many years; in fact, ever since the
falling-in of the aqueduct. <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) Jesus
was

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

again led to the house of Pilate. The archers dragged him up the stairs
with their usual brutality; his feet became entangled in his long robe,
and he fell upon the white marble steps, which were stained with blood
from his sacred head. His enemies had again taken their seats at the
entrance of the forum; the mob laughed at his fall, and the archers
struck their innocent victim, instead of assisting him to rise. Pilate
was reclining on a species of easy-chair, with a little table before
him, and surrounded with officers and persons who held strips of
parchment covered with writing in their hands. He came forward and said
to the accusers of Jesus: '*You have presented unto me. this man, as one
that perverteth the people, and behold I, having examined him before
you, find no came in this man in those things wherein you accuse him.
No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold*,

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

*nothing worthy of death is done to him. I will chastise him, therefore,
and release him*.'

When the Pharisees heard these words, they became furious, and
endeavoured to the utmost of their power to persuade the people to
revolt, distributing money among them to effect this purpose. Pilate
looked around with contempt, and addressed them in scornful words.

It happened to be the precise time when, according to an ancient custom,
the people had the privilege of demanding the deliverance of one
prisoner. The Pharisees had dispatched emissaries to persuade the people
to demand the death, and not the life, of our Lord. Pilate hoped that
they would ask for Jesus, and determined to give them to choose between
him and a criminal called Barabbas, who had been convicted of a dreadful
murder committed during a sedition, as also of many other crimes, and
was, moreover, detested by the people.

There was considerable excitement among the crowd; a certain portion
came forward, and their orators, addressing Pilate in a loud voice,
said: 'Grant us the favour you have always granted on the festival day.'
Pilate made answer: 'It is customary for me to deliver to you a criminal
at the Paschal time; *whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas, or
Jesus that is called Christ*?'

Although Pilate did not in his own mind feel at all certain that Jesus
was the King of the Jews, yet he called him so, partly because his Roman
pride made him take delight in humbling the Jews by calling such a
despicable-looking person their king; and partly because he felt a kind
of inward belief that Jesus might really be that miraculous king, that
Messiah who had been promised. He saw plainly that the priests were
incited by envy alone in their accusations against Jesus; this made him
most anxious to disappoint them; and the desire was increased by that
glimmering of the truth which partly enlightened his mind. There was
some hesitation among the crowd when Pilate asked this question, and a
few voices answered, '*Barabbas*.' A servant sent by Pilate's wife asked
for him at this moment; he left the platform, and the messenger

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

presented the pledge which he had given her, saying at the same time:
'Claudia Procles begs you to remember your promise this morning.' The
Pharisees and the priests walked anxiously and hastily about among the
crowd, threatening some and ordering others, although, in fact, little
was required to incite the already infuriated multitude.

Mary, with Magdalen, John, and the holy women, stood in a corner of the
forum, trembling and weeping; for although the Mother of Jesus was fully
aware that the redemption of man could not be brought about by any other
means than the death of her Son, yet she was filled with the anguish of
a mother, and with a longing desire to save him from those tortures and
from that death which he was about to suffer. She prayed God not to
allow such a fearful crime to be perpetrated; she repeated the words of
Jesus in the Garden of Olives: 'If it is possible, let this chalice pass
away.' She still felt a glimmering of hope, because there was a report
current that Pilate wished to acquit Jesus. Groups of persons, mostly
inhabitants of Capharnaum, where Jesus had taught, and among whom he had
wrought so many miraculous cures, were congregated in her vicinity; they
pretended not to remember either her or her weeping companions; they
simply cast a glance now and then, as if by chance, at their
closely-veiled figures. Many thought, as did her companions likewise,
that these persons at least would reject Barabbas, and beg for the life
of their Saviour and Benefactor; but these hopes were, alas, fallacious.

Pilate sent back the pledge to his wife, as an assurance of his
intention to keep his promise. He again came forward on the platform,
and seated himself at the little table. The Chief Priests took their
seats likewise, and Pilate once more demanded: '*Which of the two am I
to deliver up to you*?' A general cry resounded through the hall: '*Not
this man, but Barabbas*!' '*But what am I to do with Jesus, who is
called Christ*?' replied Pilate. All exclaimed in a tumultuous manner:
'*Let him be crucified! let him be crucified*!' '*But what evil has he
done*?' asked

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pilate for the
third time. '*I find no cause in him. I will scourge and then acquit
him*.' But the cry, '*Crucify him! Crucify him!*' burst from the crowd,
and the sounds echoed like an infernal tempest; the High Priests and the
Pharisees vociferated and hurried backwards and forwards as if insane.
Pilate at last yielded; his weak pusillanimous character could not
withstand such violent demonstrations; he delivered up Barabbas to the
people, and condemned Jesus to be scourged.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_10"></span>[201:1](pjc35.htm#fr_10.md) The cause of the
quarrel between Pilate and Herod was, according to the account of Sister
Emmerich, simply this: Pilate had undertaken to build an aqueduct on the
south-east side of the mountain on which the Temple stood, at the edge
of the torrent into which the waters of the pool of Bethsaida emptied
themselves, and this aqueduct was to carry off the refuse of the Temple.
Herod, through the medium of one of his confidants, who was a member of
the Sanhedrim, agreed to furnish him with the necessary materials, as
also with twenty-eight architects, who were also Herodians. His aim was
to set the Jews still more against the Roman governor, by causing the
undertaking to fail. He accordingly came to a private understanding with
the architects, who agreed to construct the aqueduct in such a manner
that it would be certain to fall. When the work was almost finished, and
a number of bricklayers from Ophel were busily employed in removing the
scaffolding, the twenty-eight builders went on to the top of the Tower
of Siloe to contemplate the crash which they knew must take place. Not
only did the whole of the building crumble to pieces, fall, and kill
ninety-three workmen, but even the tower containing the twenty-eight
architects came down, and not one escaped death. This accident occurred
a short time previous to the 8th of January, two years after Jesus had
commenced preaching; it took place on Herod's birthday, the same day
that John the Baptist was beheaded in the Castle of Marcherunt. No Roman
officer attended these festivities on account of the affair of the
aqueduct, although Pilate had, with hypocritical politeness, been
requested to take a part in them. Sister Emmerich saw some of the
disciples of Jesus carry the news of this event into Samaria, where he
was teaching, on the 8th of January. Jesus went from thence to Hebron,
to comfort the family of John; and she saw him, on the 13th of January,
cure many among the workmen of Ophel who had been injured by the fall of
the aqueduct. We have seen by the relation previously given how little
gratitude they <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> showed him. The enmity
of Herod towards Pilate was still farther increased by the manner in
which the latter revenged himself on the followers of Herod. We will
insert here a few details which were communicated at different times to
Sister Emmerich. On the 25th of March, of the second year of our Lord's
preaching, when Jesus and his disciples were in the neighbourhood of
Bethania, they were warned by Lazarus that Judas of Gaulon intended to
excite an insurrection against Pilate. On the 28th of March, Pilate
issued a proclamation to the effect that he intended to impose a tax,
the proceeds of which were partly to cover the expenses he had incurred
in raising the building which had just fallen to the ground. This
announcement was followed by a sedition headed by Judas of Gaulon, who
always stood up for liberty, and who was (unknown to himself) a tool in
the hands of the Herodians. The Herodians were rather like our
Freemasons. On the 30th of March, at ten o'clock P.M., Jesus, dressed in
a dark garment, was teaching in the Temple, with his Apostles and thirty
disciples. The revolt of the Galilæans against Pilate burst forth on
this very day, and the rebels set free fifty of their number who had
been imprisoned the day before; and many among the Romans were killed.
On the 6th of April, Pilate caused the Galilæans to be massacred at the
moment of offering sacrifice, by disguised soldiers whom he had
concealed in the Temple. Judas was killed with his companions. This
massacre exasperated Herod still more against Pilate, and we have just
seen by what means their reconciliation was affected.
