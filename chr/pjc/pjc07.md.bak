# MEDITATION III.

### Arrangements for eating the Paschal Lamb.

WHEN the disciples had spoken to Heli of Hebron, the latter went back
into the house by the court, but they turned to the right, and hastened
down the north side of the hill, through Sion. They passed over a
bridge, and walking along a road covered with brambles, reached the
other side of the ravine, which was in front of the Temple, and of the
row of houses which were to the south of that building. There stood the
house of the aged Simeon, who died in the Temple after the presentation
of our Lord; and his sons, some of whom were disciples of Jesus in

secret, were actually living there. The Apostles spoke to one of them, a
tall dark-complexioned man, who held some office in the Temple. They
went with him to the eastern side of the Temple, through that part of
Ophel by which Jesus made his entry into Jerusalem on Palm-Sunday, and
thence to the cattle-market, which stood in the town, to the north of
the Temple. In the southern part of this market I saw little enclosures
in which some beautiful lambs were gambolling about. Here it was that
lambs for the Pasch were bought. I saw the son of Simeon enter one of
these enclosures; and the lambs gambolled round him as if they knew him.
He chose out four, which were carried to the supper-room. In the
afternoon I saw him in the supper-room, engaged in preparing the Paschal
Lamb.

I saw Peter and John go to several different parts of the town, and
order various things. I saw them also standing opposite the door of a
house situated to the north of Mount Calvary, where the disciples of
Jesus lodged the greatest part of the time, and which belonged to
Seraphia (afterwards called Veronica). Peter and John sent some
disciples from thence to the supper-room, giving them several
commissions, which I have forgotten.

They also went into Seraphia's house, where they had several
arrangements to make. Her husband, who was a member of the council, was
usually absent and engaged in business; but even when he was at home she
saw little of him. She was a woman of about the age of the Blessed
Virgin, and had long been connected with the Holy Family; for when the
Child Jesus remained the three days in Jerusalem after the feast, she it
was who supplied him with food.

The two Apostles took from thence, among other things, the chalice of
which our Lord made use in the institution of the Holy Eucharist.
