# CHAPTER XIX.

### Pilate and his Wife.

WHILST the Jews were leading Jesus to Herod, I saw Pilate go to his
wife, Claudia Procles. She hastened to meet him, and they went together
into a small garden-house which was on one of the terraces behind the
palace. Claudia appeared to be much excited, and under the influence of
fear. She was a tall, fine-looking woman, although extremely pale. Her
hair was plaited and slightly ornamented, but partly covered by a long,
veil which fell gracefully over her shoulders. She wore earrings, a
necklace, and her flowing dress was drawn together and held up by a
species of clasp. She conversed with Pilate for a long time, and
entreated him by all that he held sacred not to injure Jesus, that
Prophet, that saint of saints; and she related the extraordinary dreams
or visions which she had had on the previous night concerning him.

Whilst she was speaking I saw the greatest part of

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

these visions: the following were the most striking. In the first place,
the principal events in the life of our Lord--the annunciation, the
nativity, the adoration of the shepherds and that of the kings, the
prophecy of Simeon and that. of Anna, the flight into Egypt, the
massacre of the Innocents, and our Lord's temptation in the wilderness.
She had likewise been shown in her sleep the most striking features of
the public life of Jesus. He always appeared to her environed with a
resplendent light, but his malicious and cruel enemies were under the
most horrible and disgusting forms imaginable. She saw his intense
sufferings, his patience, and his inexhaustible love, likewise the
anguish of his Mother, and her perfect resignation. These visions filled
the wife of Pilate with the greatest anxiety and terror, particularly as
they were accompanied by symbols which made her comprehend their
meaning, and her tender feelings were barrowed by the sight of such
dreadful scenes. She had suffered from them during the whole of the
night; they were sometimes obscure, but more often clear and distinct;
and when morning dawned and she was roused by the noise of the
tumultuous mob who were dragging Jesus to be judged, she glanced at the
procession and instantly saw that the unresisting victim in the midst of
the crowd, bound, suffering, and so inhumanely treated as to be scarcely
recognisable, was no other than that bright and glorious being who had
been so often brought before her eyes in the visions of the past night.
She was greatly affected by this sight, and immediately sent for Pilate,
and gave him an account of all that had happened to her. She spoke with
much vehemence and emotion; and although there was a great deal in what
she had seen which she could not understand, much less express, yet she
entreated and implored. her husband in the most touching terms to grant
her request.

Pilate was both astonished and troubled by the words of his wife. He
compared the narration with all he had previously heard concerning
Jesus; and reflected on the hatred of the Jews, the majestic silence of
our Saviour,

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

and the mysterious answers he had given to all his questions. He
hesitated for some time, but was at last overcome by the entreaties of
his wife, and told her that he had already declared his conviction of
the innocence of Jesus, and that he would not condemn him, because he
saw that the accusations were mere fabrications of his enemies. He spoke
of the words of Jesus to himself, promised his wife that nothing should
induce him to condemn this just man, and even gave her a ring before
they parted as a pledge of his promise.

The character of Pilate was debauched and undecided, but his worst
qualities were an extreme pride and meanness which made him never
hesitate in the performance of an unjust action, provided it answered
his ends. He was excessively superstitious, and when in any difficulty
had recourse to charms and spells. He was much puzzled and alarmed about
the trial of Jesus; and I saw him running backwards and forwards,
offering incense first to one god and then to another, and imploring
them to assist him; but Satan filled his imagination with still greater
confusion; he first instilled one false idea and then another into his
mind. He then had recourse to one of his favourite superstitious
practices, that of watching the sacred chickens eat, but in vain,--his
mind remained enveloped in darkness, and he became more and more
undecided. He first thought that he would acquit our Saviour, whom he
well knew to be innocent, but then he feared incurring the wrath of his
false gods if he spared him, as he fancied he might be a species of
demigod, and obnoxious to them 'It is possible,' said he inwardly, 'that
this man may really be that king of the Jews concerning whose coming
there are so many prophecies. It was a king of the Jews whom the Magi
came from the East to adore. Perhaps he is a secret enemy both of our
gods and of the emperor; it might be most imprudent in me to spare his
life. Who knows whether his death would not be a triumph to my gods?'
Then he remembered the wonderful dreams described to him by his wife,
who had never seen Jesus, and he again changed, and decided that it
would be safer

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

not to condemn him. He tried to persuade himself that he wished to pass
a just sentence; but he deceived himself, for when he asked himself,
'What is the truth?' he did not wait for the answer. His mind was filled
with confusion, and he was quite at a loss how to act, as his sole
desire was to entail no risk upon himself.
