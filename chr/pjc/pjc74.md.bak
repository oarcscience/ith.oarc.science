# CHAPTER LX.

### The Eve of the Resurrection.

TOWARDS the close of the Sabbath-day, John came to see the holy women.
He endeavoured to give some consolation, but could not restrain his own
tears, and only remained a short time with them. They had likewise a
short visit from Peter and James the Greater, after which they retired
to their cells, and gave free vent to grief, sitting upon ashes, and
veiling themselves even more closely.

The prayer of the Blessed Virgin was unceasing. She ever kept her eyes
fixed interiorly on Jesus, and was perfectly consumed by her ardent
desire of once more beholding him whom she loved with such inexpressible
love. Suddenly an angel stood by her side, and bade her arise and go to
the door of the dwelling of Nicodemus, for that the Lord was very near.
The heart of the Blessed Virgin leaped for joy. She hastily wrapped her
cloak about her, and left the holy women, without informing them where
she was going. I saw her walk quickly to a small entrance which was cut
in the town wall, the identical one through which she had entered when
returning with her companions from the sepulchre.

It was about nine o'clock at night, and the Blessed Virgin had almost
reached the entrance, when I saw her stop suddenly in a very solitary
spot, and look upwards

in an ecstasy of delight, for on the top of the town wall She beheld the
soul of our Lord, resplendent with light without the appearance of a
wound, and surrounded by patriarchs. He descended towards her, turned to
his companions, and presenting her to them, said, 'Behold Mary, behold
my Mother.' He appeared to me to salute her with a kiss, and he then
disappeared. The Blessed Virgin knelt down, and most reverently kissed
the ground on which he had stood, and the impression of her hands and
knees remained imprinted upon the stones. This sight filled her with
inexpressible joy, and she immediately rejoined the holy women, who were
busily employed in preparing the perfumes and spices. She did not tell
them what she had seen, but her firmness and strength of mind were
restored. She was perfectly renovated, and therefore comforted all the
rest, and endeavoured to strengthen their faith.

All the holy women were sitting by a long table, the cover of which hung
down to the floor, when Mary returned; bundles of herbs were heaped
around them, and these they mixed together and arranged; small flasks,
containing sweet unctions and water of spikenard, were standing near, as
also bunches of natural flowers, among which I remarked one in
particular, which was like a streaked iris or a lily. Magdalen, Mary the
daughter of Cleophas, Salome, Johanna, and Mary Salome, had bought all
these things in the town during the absence of Mary. Their intention was
to go to the sepulchre before sunrise on the following day, in order to
strew these flowers and perfumes over the body of their beloved Master.
