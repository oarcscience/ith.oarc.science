# CHAPTER XXV.

### Description of the personal Appearance of the Blessed Virgin.

WHILE these sad events were taking place I was in Jerusalem, sometimes
in one locality and sometimes in another; I was quite overcome, my
sufferings were intense, and I felt as if about to expire. During the
time of the scourging of my adorable Spouse, I sat in the vicinity, in a
part which no Jew dared approach, for fear of defiling himself; but I
did not fear defilement, I was only anxious for a drop of our Lord's
blood to fall upon me, to purify me. I felt so completely heartbroken
that I thought I must die as I could not relieve Jesus, and each blow
which he received drew from me such sobs and moans that I felt quite
astonished at not being driven away. When the executioners took Jesus
into the guardhouse, to crown him with thorns, I longed to follow that I
might again contemplate him in his sufferings. Then it was that the
Mother of Jesus, accompanied by the holy women, approached the pillar
and wiped up the blood with which it and the ground around were
saturated. The door of the guard-house was open, and I heard the brutal
laughter of the heartless men who were busily employed in finishing off
the crown of thorns which they had prepared for our Lord. I was too much
affected to weep, but I endeavoured to drag myself near to the place
where our Lord was to be crowned with thorns.

I once more saw the Blessed Virgin; her countenance was wan and pale,
her eves red with weeping, but the

simple dignity of her demeanour cannot be described. Notwithstanding her
grief and anguish, notwithstanding the fatigue which she had endured
(for she had been wandering ever since the previous evening through the
streets of Jerusalem, and across the Valley of Josaphat), her appearance
was placid and modest, and not a fold of her dress out of place. She
looked majestically around, and her veil fell gracefully over her
shoulders. She moved quietly, and although her heart was a prey to the
most bitter grief, her countenance was calm and resigned. Her dress was
moistened by the dew which had fallen upon it during the night, and by
the tears which she had shed in such abundance; otherwise it was totally
unsoiled. Her beauty was great, but indescribable, for it was
superhuman--a mixture of majesty, sanctity, simplicity, and purity.

The appearance of Mary Magdalen was totally different; she was taller
and more robust, the expression of her countenance Showed greater
determination, but its beauty was almost destroyed by the strong
passions which she had so long indulged, and by the violent repentance
and grief she had since felt. It was painful to look upon her; she was
the very picture of despair, her long dishevelled hair was partly
covered by her torn and wet veil, and her appearance was that of one
completely absorbed by woe, and almost beside herself from sorrow. Many
of the inhabitants of Magdalum were standing near, gazing at her with
surprise and curiosity, for they had known her in former days, first in
prosperity and afterwards in degradation and consequent misery. They
pointed, they even cast mud upon her, but she saw nothing, knew nothing,
and felt nothing, save her agonising grief.
