# INTRODUCTION.

THE following meditations will probably rank high among many similar
works which the contemplative love of Jesus has produced; but it is our
duty, here plainly to affirm that they have no pretensions whatever to
be regarded as history. They are but intended to take one of the lowest
places among those numerous representations of the Passion which have
been given us by pious writers and artists, and to be considered at the
very utmost as the Lenten meditations of a devout nun, related, in all
simplicity, and written down in the plainest and most literal language,
from her own dictation. To these meditations, she herself never attached
more than a mere human value, and never related them except through
obedience, and upon the repeated commands of the directors of her
conscience.

The writer of the following pages was introduced to this holy religious
by Count Leopold de Stolberg. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) Dean
Bernard Overberg, her director extraordinary, and Bishop Michael
Sailer, <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) who had often been her
counsellor and consoler, urged her to relate to us in detail all that
she experienced; and the latter, who survived her, took the deepest
interest in the arrangement and publication of the notes taken down from
her dictation. These illustrious and holy men, now dead, and whose
memory is blessed, were in continual communion of prayer with Anne
Catherine,

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

whom they loved and respected, on account of the singular graces with
which God had favoured her. The editor of this book received equal
encouragement, and met with no less sympathy in his labours, from the
late Bishop of Ratisbonne, Mgr. Wittman. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) This holy Bishop, who was so deeply versed
in the ways of Divine grace, and so well acquainted with its effects on
certain souls, both from his private investigations of the subject, and
his own experience, took the most lively interest in all that concerned
Anne Catherine, and on hearing of the work in which the editor of this
book was engaged, he strongly exhorted him to publish it. 'These things
have not been communicated to you for nothing,' would he often say; 'God
has his views in all. Publish something at least of what you know, for
you will thereby benefit many souls.' He at the same time brought
forward various instances from his own experience and that of others,
showing the benefit which had been derived from the study of works of a
similar character. He delighted in calling such privileged souls as Anne
Catherine *the marrow of the bones of the Church*, according to the
expression of St. John Chrysostom, *medulla enim hujus mundi sunt*, and
he encouraged the publication of their lives and writings as far as lay
in. his power.

The editor of this book being taken by a kind friend to the dying bed of
the holy Bishop, had no reason whatever to expect to be recognised, as
he had only once in his life conversed with him for a few minutes;
nevertheless the dying saint knew him again, and after a few most kind
words blessed and exhorted him to continue his work for the glory of
God.

Encouraged by the approbation of such men, we therefore yield to the
wishes of many virtuous friends in publishing the Meditations on the
Passion, of this humble religious, to whom God granted the favour of
being at times simple, ingenuous, and ignorant as a child, while at
others

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

she was clear-sighted, sensible, possessed of a deep insight into the
most mysterious and hidden things, and consumed with burning and heroic
zeal, but ever forgetful of self, deriving her whole strength from Jesus
alone, and steadfast in the most perfect humility and entire
self-abnegation.

We give our readers a slight sketch of her life, intending at some
future they to publish her biography more in full.
