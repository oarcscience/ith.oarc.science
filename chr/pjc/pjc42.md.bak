# CHAPTER XXVIII.

### Reflections on the Visions.

WHENEVER, during my meditations on the Passion of our Lord, I imagine I
hear that frightful cry of the Jews, '*His blood be upon us, and upon
our children*,' visions of a wonderful and terrible description display
before my eyes at the same moment the effect of that solemn curse. I
fancy I see a gloomy sky covered with clouds, of the colour of blood,
from which issue fiery swords and darts, lowering over the vociferating
multitude; and this curse, which they have entailed upon themselves,
appears to me to penetrate even to the very marrow of their bones, even
to the unborn infants. They appear to me encompassed on all sides by
darkness; the words they utter take, in my eyes, the form of black
flames, which recoil upon them, penetrating the bodies of some, and only
playing around others.

The last-mentioned were those who were converted after the death of
Jesus, and who were in considerable numbers, for neither Jesus nor Mary
ever ceased praying, in the midst of their sufferings, for the salvation
of these miserable beings.

When, during visions of this kind, I turn my thoughts to the holy souls
of Jesus and Mary, and to those of the enemies of Christ, all that takes
place within them is

shown me under various forms. I see numerous devils among the crowd,
exciting and encouraging the Jews, whispering in their ears, entering
their months, inciting them still more against Jesus, but nevertheless
trembling at the sight of his ineffable love and heavenly patience.
Innumerable angels surrounded Jesus, Mary, and the small number of
saints who were there. The exterior of these angels denotes the office
they fall; some represent consolation, others prayer, or some of the
works of mercy.

I likewise often see consolatory, and at other times menacing voices,
under the appearance of bright or coloured gleams of light, issuing from
the mouths of these different apparitions; and I see the feelings of
their souls, their interior sufferings, and in a word, their every
thought, under the appearance of dark or bright rays. I then understand
everything perfectly, but it is impossible for me to give an explanation
to others; besides which, I am so ill, and so totally overcome by the
grief which I feel for my own sins and for those of the world, I am so
overpowered by the sight of the sufferings of our Lord, that I can
hardly imagine how it is possible for me to relate events with the
slightest coherency. Many of these things, but more especially the
apparitions of devils and of angels, which are related by other persons
who have had visions of the Passion of Jesus Christ, are fragments of
symbolical interior perceptions of this species, which vary according to
the state of the soul of the spectator. Hence the numerous
contradictions, because many things are naturally forgotten or omitted.

Sister Emmerich sometimes spoke on these subjects, either during the
time of her visions on the Passion, or before they commenced; but she
more often refused to speak at all concerning them, for fear of causing
confusion in the visions. It is easy to see how difficult it must have
been for her, in the midst of such a variety of apparitions, to preserve
any degree of connection in her narrations. Who can therefore be
surprised at finding some omissions and confusion in her descriptions?
