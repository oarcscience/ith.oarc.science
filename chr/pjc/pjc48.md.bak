# CHAPTER XXXIV.

### The Veil of Veronica.

WHILE the procession was passing through a long street, an incident took
place which made a strong impression upon Simon. Numbers of respectable
persons were hurrying towards the Temple, of whom many got out of the
way when they saw Jesus, from a Pharisaical fear of defilement, while
others, on the contrary, stopped and expressed pity for his sufferings.
But when the procession had advanced about two hundred steps from the
spot where Simon began to assist our Lord in carrying his cross, the
door of a beautiful house on the left opened, and a woman of majestic
appearance, holding a young girl by the hand, came out, and walked up to
the very head of the procession. Seraphia was the name of the brave
woman who thus dared to confront the enraged multitude; she was the wife
of Sirach, one of the councillors belonging to the Temple, and was
afterwards known by the name of Veronica, which name was given from the
words *vera icon* (true portrait), to commemorate her brave conduct on
this day.

Seraphia had prepared some excellent aromatic wine, which she piously
intended to present to our Lord to refresh him on his dolorous way to
Calvary. She had been standing in the street for some time, and at last
went back into the house to wait. She was, when I first saw her,
enveloped in a long veil, and holding a little girl of nine years of
age, whom she had adopted, by the hand; a large veil was likewise
hanging on her arm, and the little girl endeavoured to hide the jar of
wine when the procession approached. Those who were marching at the head
of the

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

procession tried to push. her back; but she made her way through the
mob, the soldiers, and the archers, reached Jesus, fell on her knees
before him, and presented the veil, saying at the same time, 'Permit me
to wipe the face of my Lord.' Jesus took the veil in his left hand,
wiped his bleeding face, and returned it with thanks. Seraphia kissed
it, and put it under her cloak. The girl then timidly offered the wine,
but the brutal soldiers would not allow Jesus to drink it. The
suddenness of this courageous act of Seraphia had surprised the guards,
and caused a momentary although unintentional halt, of which she had
taken advantage to present the veil to her Divine Master. Both the
Pharisees and the guards were greatly exasperated, not only by the
sudden halt, but much more by the public testimony of veneration which
was thus paid to Jesus, and they revenged themselves by striking and
abusing him, while Seraphia returned in haste to her house.

No sooner did she reach her room than she placed the woollen veil on a
table, and fell almost senseless on her knees. A friend who entered the
room a short time after, found her thus kneeling, with the child weeping
by her side, and saw, to his astonishment, the bloody countenance of our
Lord imprinted upon the veil, a perfect likeness, although heartrending
and painful to look upon. He roused Seraphia, and pointed to the veil.
She again knelt down before it, and exclaimed through her tears, 'Now I
shall indeed leave all with a happy heart, for my Lord has given me a
remembrance of himself.' The texture of this veil was a species of very
fine wool; it was three times the length of its width, and was generally
worn on the shoulders. It was customary to present these veils to
persons who were in affliction, or over-fatigued, or ill, that they
might wipe their faces with them, and it was done in order to express
sympathy or compassion. Veronica kept this veil until her death, and
hung it at the head of her bed; it was then given to the Blessed Virgin,
who left It to the Apostles, and they afterwards passed it on to the
Church.

Seraphia and John the Baptist were cousins, her father

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

and Zacharias being brothers. When Joachim and Anna brought the Blessed
Virgin, who was then only four years old, up to Jerusalem, to place her
among the virgins in the Temple, they lodged in the house of Zacharias,
which was situated near the fish-market. Seraphia was at least five
years older than the Blessed Virgin, was present at her marriage with
St. Joseph, and was likewise related to the aged Simeon, who prophesied
when the Child Jesus was put into his arms. She was brought up with his
sons, both of whom, as well as Seraphia, he imbued with his ardent
desire of seeing our Lord. When Jesus was twelve years old, and remained
teaching in the Temple, Seraphia, who was not then married, sent food
for him every day to a little inn, a quarter of a mile from Jerusalem,
where he dwelt when he was not in the Temple. Mary went there for two
days, when on her way from Bethlehem to Jerusalem to offer her Child in
the Temple. The two old men who kept this inn were Essenians, and well
acquainted with the Holy Family; it contained a kind of foundation for
the poor, and Jesus and his disciples often went there for a night's
lodging.

Seraphia married rather late in life; her husband, Sirach, was descended
from the chaste Susannah, and was a member of the Sanhedrim. He was at
first greatly opposed to our Lord, and his wife suffered much on account
of her attachment to Jesus, and to the holy women, but Joseph of
Arimathea and Nicodemus brought him to a better state of feeling, and he
allowed Seraphia to follow our Lord. When Jesus was unjustly accused in
the court of Caiphas, the husband of Seraphia joined with Joseph and
Nicodemus in attempts to obtain the liberation of our Lord, and all
three resigned their seats in the Council.

Seraphia was about fifty at the time of the triumphant procession of our
Lord when he entered into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, and I then saw her
take off her veil and spread it on the ground for him to walk upon. It
was this same veil, which she presented to Jesus, at this his second
procession, a procession which outwardly appeared

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

to be far less glorious, but was in fact much more so. This veil
obtained for her the name of Veronica, and it is still shown for the
veneration of the faithful.
