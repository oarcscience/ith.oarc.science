# CHAPTER XXIV.

### Interruption of the Visions of the Passion by the Appearance of St. Joseph under the form of a Child.

DURING the whole time of the visions which we have just narrated (that
is to say, from the 18th of February until the 8th of March), Sister
Emmerich continued to suffer all the mental and bodily tortures which
were once endured by our Lord. Being totally immersed in these
meditations, and, as it were, dead to exterior objects, she wept and
groaned like a person in the hands of an executioner, trembled,
shuddered, and writhed on her couch.. while her face resembled that of a
man about to expire under torture, and a bloody sweat often trickled
over her chest and shoulders. She generally perspired so profusely that
her bed and clothes were saturated. Her sufferings from thirst were
likewise fearful, and she might truly be compared to a person perishing
in a desert from the want of water. Generally speaking, her mouth was so
parched in the morning, and her tongue so contracted and dried up, that
she could not speak, but was obliged by signs and inarticulate sounds to
beg for relief. Her constant state of fever was probably brought on by
the great pains she endured, added to which she likewise often took upon
herself the illnesses and temporal calamities merited by others. It was
always necessary for her to rest for a time before relating the
different scenes of the Passion, nor was it always that she could speak
of what she had seen, and she was even often obliged to discontinue her
narrations for the day. She was in this state of suffering on Saturday
the 8th of March, and with the greatest difficulty and

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

suffering described the scourging of our Lord which she had seen in the
vision of the previous night, and which appeared to be present to her
mind during the greatest part, of the following day. Towards evening,
however, a change took place, and there was an interruption in the
course of meditations on the Passion which had latterly followed one
another so regularly. We will describe this interruption, in order, in
the first place, to give our readers a more full comprehension of the
interior life of this most extraordinary person; and, in the second, to
enable them to pause for a time to rest their minds, as I well know that
meditations on the Passion of our Lord exhaust the weak, even when they
remember that it was for their salvation that he suffered and died.

The life of Sister Emmerich, both as regarded her spiritual and
intellectual existence, invariably harmonised with the spirit of the
Church at different seasons of the year. It harmonised even more
strongly than man's natural life does with the seasons, or with the
hours of the day, and this caused her to be (if we may thus express
ourselves) a realisation of the existence and of the various intentions
of the Church. Her union with its spirit was so complete, that no sooner
did a festival day begin (that is to say, on the eve), than a perfect
change took place within her, both intellectually and spiritually. As
soon as the spiritual sun of these festival days of the Church was set,
she directed all her thoughts towards that which would rise on the
following day, and disposed all her prayers, good works, and sufferings
for the attainment of the special graces attached to the feast about to
commence, like a plant which absorbs the dew, and revels in the warmth
and light of the first rays of the sun. These changes did not, as will
readily be believed, always take place at the exact moment when the
sound of the Angelus announced the commencement of a festival, and
summoned the faithful to prayer; for this bell is often, either through
ignorance or negligence, rung at the wrong time; but they commenced at
the time when the feast really began.

If the Church commemorated a sorrowful mystery, she

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

appeared depressed, faint, and almost powerless; but the instant the
celebration of a joyful feast commenced, both body and soul revived to a
new life, as if refreshed by the dew of new graces, and she continued in
this calm, quiet, and happy state, quite released from every kind of
suffering, until the evening. These things took place in her soul quite
independently of her will; but as she had had from infancy the most
ardent desire of being obedient to Jesus and to his Church, God had
bestowed upon her those special graces which give a natural facility for
practising obedience. Every faculty of her soul was directed towards the
Church, in the same manner as a plant which, even if put into a dark
cellar, naturally turns its leaves upwards, and appears to seek the
light.

On Saturday, 8th of March 1823, after sunset, Sister Emmerich had, with
the greatest difficulty, portrayed the different events of the scourging
of our Lord, and the writer of these pages thought that her mind was
occupied in the contemplation of the 'crowning with thorns,' when
suddenly her countenance, which was previously pale and haggard, like
that of a person on the point of death, became bright and serene, and
she exclaimed in a coaxing tone, as if speaking to a child, 'O, that
dear little boy! Who is he?--Stay, I will ask him. His name is Joseph.
He has pushed his way through the crowd to come to me. Poor child, he is
laughing; he knows nothing at all of what is going on. How light his
clothing is! I fear he must be cold, the air is so sharp this morning.
Wait, my child; let me put something more over you.' After saying these
words in such a natural tone of voice that it was almost impossible for
those present not to turn round and expect to see the child, she held up
a dress which was near her, as would be done by a kind-hearted person
wishing to clothe a poor frozen child. The friend who was standing by
her bedside had not sufficient time to ask her to explain the words she
had spoken, for a sudden change took place, both in her whole appearance
and manner, when her attendant pronounced the word *obedience*,--one of
the vows by which she had consecrated herself to our

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

Lord. She instantly came to herself, and, like an obedient child
awakening from a sound sleep and starting up at the voice of its mother,
she stretched forth her hand, took the rosary and crucifix which were
always at her side, arranged her dress, rubbed her eyes, and sat up. She
was then carried from her bed to a chair, as she could neither stand nor
walk; and it being the time for making her bed, her friend left the room
in order to write out what he had heard during the day.

On Sunday, the 9th of March, the friend asked her attendant what Sister
Emmerich meant the evening before when she spoke of a child called
Joseph. The attendant answered, 'She spoke of him again many times
yesterday evening; he is the son of a cousin of mine, and a great
favourite of hers. I fear that her talking so much about him is a sign
that he is going to have an illness, for she said so many times that the
poor child was almost without clothing and that he must be cold.'

The friend remembered having often seen this little Joseph playing on
the bed of Sister Emmerich, and he supposed that she was dreaming about
him on the previous day. When the friend went to see her later in the
day to endeavour to obtain a continuation of the narrations of the
Passion, he found her, contrary to his expectation, more calm, and
apparently better in health than on the previous day. She told him that
she had seen nothing more after the scourging of our Lord; and when he
questioned her concerning what she had said about little Joseph, she
could not remember having spoken of the child at all. He then asked the
reason of her being so calm, serene, and apparently well in health; and
she answered, 'I always feel thus when Mid-Lent comes, for then the
Church sings with Isaias in the introit at Mass; "Rejoice, O, Jerusalem,
and come together all you that love her; rejoice with joy, you that have
been in sorrow, that you may exult and be filled from the breasts of
your consolation." Mid-Lent Sunday is consequently a day of rejoicing;
and you may likewise remember that, in the gospel of this day, the
Church relates how our Lord fed

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, of which twelve
baskets of fragments remained, consequently we ought to rejoice.'

She likewise added, that our Lord had deigned to visit her on that day
in the Holy Communion, and that she always felt especial spiritual
consolation when she received him on that particular day of the year.
The friend cast his eyes on the calendar of the diocese of Munster, and
saw that on that day they not only kept Mid-Lent Sunday, but likewise
the Feast of St. Joseph, the foster-father of our Lord; he was not aware
of this before, because in other places the feast of St. Joseph is kept
on the 19th, and he remarked this circumstance to Sister Emmerich, and
asked her whether she did not think that was the cause of her speaking
about Joseph. She answered that she was perfectly aware of its being the
feast of the foster-father of Jesus, but that she had not been thinking
of the child of that name. However, a moment after, she suddenly
remembered what her thoughts had been the day before, and explained to
her friend that the moment the feast of St. Joseph began, her visions of
the sorrowful mysteries of the Passion ceased, and were superseded by
totally different scenes, in which St. Joseph appeared under the form of
a child, and that it was to him that the words we have mentioned above
were addressed.

We found that when she received these communications the vision was
often in the form of a child, especially in those cases when an artist
would have made use of that simile to express his ideas. If, for
instance, the accomplishment of some Scripture prophecy was being shown
to her, she often saw by the side of the illustration a child, who
clearly designated the characteristics of such or such a prophet, by his
position, his dress, and the manner in which he held in his hand and
waved to and fro the prophetic roll appended to a staff.

Sometimes, when she was in extreme suffering, a beautiful child, dressed
in green, with a calm and serene countenance, would approach, and seat
himself in a posture of resignation at the side of her bed, allowing
himself to be

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

moved from one side to the other, or even put down on to the ground,
without the smallest opposition and constantly looking at her
affectionately and consoling her. If, when quite prostrate from illness
and the sufferings of others which she had taken upon herself, she
entered into communication with a saint, either by participation in the
celebration of his feast, or from his relics being brought to her, she
sometimes saw passages of the childhood of this saint, and at others the
most terrible scenes of his martyrdom. In her greatest sufferings she
was usually consoled, instructed, or reproved (whichever the occasion
called for) by apparitions under the form of children. Sometimes, when
totally overcome by trouble and distress, she would fall asleep, and be
carried back in imagination to the scenes and perils of her childhood.
She sometimes dreamed, as her exclamations and gestures demonstrated,
that she was once more a little country girl of five years old, climbing
over a hedge, caught in the briars, and weeping with fear.

These scenes of her childhood were always events which had really
occurred, and the words which escaped her showed what was passing in her
mind. She would exclaim (as if repeating the words of others): 'Why do
you call out so?' 'I will not hold the hedge back until you are quiet
and ask me gently to do so.' She had obeyed this injunction when she was
a child and caught in the hedge, and she followed the same rule when
grown up and suffering from the most terrible trials. She often spoke
and joked about the thorn hedge, and the patience and prayer which had
then been recommended to her, which admonition she, in after-life, had
frequently neglected, but which had never failed her when she had
recourse to it. This symbolical coincidence of the elements of her
childhood with those of her riper years shows that, in the individual no
less than in humanity at large, prophetic types may be found. But, to
the individual as well as to mankind in general, a Divine Type has been
given in the person of our Redeemer, in order that both the one and the
other, by walking in his footsteps and with his assistance,

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

may surpass human nature and attain to perfect wisdom and grace with God
and man. Thus it is that the will of God is done on earth as in heaven,
and that his kingdom is attained by 'men of good will.'

She then gave a short account of the visions which had, on the previous
night, interrupted her visions of the Passion at the commencement of the
feast of St. Joseph.
