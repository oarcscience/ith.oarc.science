# CHAPTER LIII.

### The Return from the Sepulchre.--Joseph of Arimathea is put in Prison.

THE Sabbath was close at hand, and Nicodemus and Joseph returned to
Jerusalem by a small door not far from the garden, and which Joseph had
been allowed by special favour to have made in the city wall. They told
the Blessed Virgin, Magdalen, John, and some of the women, who were
returning to Calvary to pray there, that this door, as well as that of
the supper-room, would be opened to them whenever they knocked. The
elder sister of the Blessed Virgin, Mary of Heli, returned to the town
with Mary the mother of Mark, and some other women. The servants of
Nicodemus and Joseph went to Calvary to fetch several things which had
been left there.

The soldiers joined those who were guarding the city gate near Calvary;
and Cassius went to Pilate with the lance, related all that he had seen,
and promised to give him an exact account of everything that should
happen, if he would put under his command the guards whom the Jews would
not fail to ask to have put round the tomb. Pilate listened to his words
with secret terror, but only told him in reply that his superstition
amounted to madness.

Joseph and Nicodemus met Peter and the two Jameses in the town. They all
shed many tears, but Peter was perfectly overwhelmed by the violence of
his grief. He embraced them, reproached himself for not having been
present at the death of our Saviour, and thanked them for having
bestowed the rites of sepulture upon his sacred body. It was agreed that
the door of the supper-room should be opened to them whenever they
knocked, and then they went away to seek some other disciples who were
dispersed in various directions. Later I saw the Blessed Virgin and her
companions enter the supper-room; Abenadar next came and was admitted;
and by

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

degrees the greatest part of the Apostles and disciples assembled there.
The holy women retired to that part of the building where the Blessed
Virgin was living. They took some food, and spent a few minutes more in
tears, and in relating to one another what each had seen. The men
changed their dresses, and I saw them standing under the lamp, and
keeping the Sabbath. They ate some lambs in the supper-room, but without
observing any ceremony, for they had eaten the Paschal lamb the evening
before. They were all perturbed in spirit, and filled with grief. The
holy women also passed their time in praying with the Blessed Virgin
under the lamp. Later, when night had quite fallen, Lazarus, the widow
of Naïm, Dina the Samaritan woman, and Mara of Suphan, <span

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

from Bethania, and then, once more, descriptions were given of all that
had taken place, and many tears shed.

Joseph of Arimathea returned home late from the supper-room, and he was
sorrowfully walking along the streets of Sion, accompanied by a few
disciples and women, when all on a sudden a band of armed men, who were
lying in ambuscade in the neighbourhood of Caiphas's tribunal, fell upon
them, and laid hands upon Joseph, whereupon his companions fled,
uttering loud cries of terror. He was confined in a tower contiguous to
the city wall, not far from the tribunal. These soldiers were pagans,
and had not to keep the Sabbath, therefore Caiphas had been able to
secure their services on this occasion. The intention was to let Joseph
die of hunger, and keep his disappearance a secret.

Here conclude the descriptions of all that occurred on the day of the
Passion of our Lord; but we will add some supplementary matter
concerning Holy Saturday, the Descent into Hell, and the Resurrection.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_21"></span>[303:1](pjc67.htm#fr_21.md) According to the
visions of Sister Emmerich, the three women named in the text had been
living for some time at Bethania, in a sort of community established by
Martha for the purpose of providing for the maintenance of the disciples
when our Lord wag moving about, and for the division and distribution of
the alms which were collected. The widow of Naïm, whose son Martial was
raised from the dead by Jesus, according to Sister Emmerich, on the 28th
Marcheswan (the 18th of November), was named Maroni. She was the
daughter of an uncle, on the father's side, of St. Peter. Her first
husband was the son of a sister of Elizabeth, who herself was the
daughter of a sister of the mother of St. Anne. Maroni's first husband
having died without children, she had married Elind, a relation of St.
Anne, and had left Chasaluth, near Tabor, to take up her abode at Naïm,
which was not far off, and where she soon lost her second husband.

Dina, the Samaritan woman, was the same who conversed with Jesus by
Jacob's well. She was born near Damascus, of parents who were half
Jewish and half Pagan. They died while she was yet very young, and she
being brought up by a woman of bad character, the seeds of the most evil
passions were early sown in her heart. She had had several husbands, who
supplanted one another in turn, and the last lived at Sichar, whither
she had followed him and changed her name from Dina to Salome. She had
three grown-up daughters and two sons, who afterwards joined the
disciples. Sister Emmerich used to say that the life of this Samaritan
woman was prophetic--that Jesus had spoken to the entire sect of
Samaritans in her person, and that they were attached to their errors by
as many ties as she had committed adulteries.

Mara of Suphan was a Moabitess, came from the neighbourhood of Suphan,
and was a descendant of Orpha, the widow of Chélion, Noëmi's son. Orpha
had married again in Moab. By <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> Orpha,
the sister-in-law of Ruth, Mara was connected with the family of David,
from whom our Lord was descended. Sister Emmerich saw Jesus deliver Mara
from four devils and grant her forgiveness of her sins on the 17th Elud
(9th September) of the second year of his public life. She was living at
Ainon, having been repudiated by her husband, a rich Jew, who had kept
the children he had had by her with him. She had with her three others,
the offspring of her adulteries.

'I saw,' Sister Emmerich would say,--'I saw how the stray branch of the
stock of David was purified within her by the grace of Jesus, and
admitted into the bosom of the Church. I cannot express how many of
these roots and offshoots I see become entwined with each other, lost to
view, and then once more brought to light.'
