# TO THE READER

WHOEVER compares the following meditations with the short history of the
Last Supper given in the Gospel will discover some slight differences
between them. An explanation should be given of this, although it can
never be sufficiently impressed upon the reader that these writings have
no pretensions whatever to add an iota to Sacred Scripture as
interpreted by the Church.

Sister Emmerich saw the events of the Last Supper take place in the
following order:--The Paschal Lamb was immolated and prepared in the
supper-room; our Lord held a discourse on that occasion--the guests were
dressed as travellers, and ate, standing, the lamb and other food
prescribed by the law--the cup of wine was twice presented to our Lord,
but he did not drink of it the second time; distributing it to his
Apostles with these words: *I shall drink no more of the fruit of the
vine*, &c. Then they sat down; Jesus spoke of the traitor; Peter feared
lest it should be himself; Judas received from our Lord the piece of
bread dipped, which was the sign that it was he; preparations were made
for the washing of the feet; Peter strove against his feet being washed;
then came the institution of the Holy Eucharist: Judas communicated, and
afterwards left the apartment; the oils were consecrated, and
instructions given concerning them; Peter and the other Apostles
received ordination; our Lord made his final discourse; Peter protested
that he would never abandon him; and then the Supper concluded. By
adopting this order, it appears, at first, as though it were in
contradiction to the passages of St. Matthew (xxxi. 29), and of St. Mark
(xiv. 26), in which the words: *I will drink no more of the fruit of the
vine*,

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> &c., come after
the consecration, but in St. Luke, they come before. On the contrary,
all that concerns the traitor Judas comes here, as in St. Matthew and
St. Mark, before the consecration; whereas in St. Luke, it does not come
till afterwards. St. John, who does not relate the history of the
institution of the Holy Eucharist, gives us to understand that Judas
went out immediately after Jesus had given him the bread; but it appears
most probable, from the accounts of the other Evangelists, that Judas
received the Holy Communion under both forms, and several of the
fathers--St. Augustin, St. Gregory the Great, and St. Leo the Great--as
well as the tradition of the Catholic Church, tell us expressly that
such was the case. Besides, were the order in which St. John presents
events taken literally, he would contradict, not only St. Matthew and
St. Mark, but himself, for it must follow, from verse 10, chap. xiii.,
that Judas also had his feet washed. Now, the washing of the feet took
place after the eating of the Paschal Lamb, and it was necessarily
whilst it was being eaten that Jesus presented the bread to the traitor.
It is plain that the Evangelists here, as in several other parts of
their writings, gave their attention to the sacred narrative as a whole,
and did not consider themselves bound to relate every detail in
precisely the same order, which fully explains the apparent
contradictions of each other, which are to be found in their Gospels.
The following pages will appear to the attentive reader rather a simple
and natural concordance of the Gospels than a history differing in any
point of the slightest importance than that of Scripture.
