# CHAPTER XI.

### Mary in the House of Caiphas.

THE Blessed Virgin was ever united to her Divine Son by interior
spiritual communications; she was, therefore, fully aware of all that
happened to him--she suffered with him, and joined in his continual
prayer for his murderers. But her maternal feelings prompted her to
supplicate Almighty God most ardently not to suffer the crime to be
completed, and to save her Son from such dreadful torments. She eagerly
desired to return to him; and when John, who had left the tribunal at
the moment the frightful cry, '*He is guilty of death*,' was raised,
came to the house of Lazarus to see after her, and to relate the
particulars of the dreadful scene he had just witnessed, she, as also
Magdalen and some of the other holy women, begged to be taken to the
place where Jesus was suffering John, who had only left our Saviour in
order to console her whom he loved best next to his Divine Master,
instantly acceded to their request, and conducted them through the
streets, which were lighted up by the moon alone, and crowded with
persons hastening to their homes. The holy women were closely veiled;
but the sobs which they could not restrain made many who passed by
observe them, and their feelings were harrowed by the abusive epithets
they overheard bestowed upon Jesus by those who were conversing on the
subject of his arrest. The Blessed Virgin, who ever beheld in spirit the
opprobrious treatment her dear Son was receiving, continued

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> '*to lay up all
these things in her heart*;' like him she suffered in silence; but more
than once she became totally unconscious. Some disciples of Jesus, who
were returning from the hall of Caiphas, saw her fainting in the arms of
the holy women, and, touched with pity, stopped to look at her
compassionately, and saluted her in these words: 'Hail! unhappy
Mother--hail, Mother of the Most Holy One of Israel, the most afflicted
of all mothers!' Mary raised her head, thanked them gratefully, and
continued her sad journey.

When in the vicinity of Caiphas's house, their grief was renewed by the
sight of a group of men who were busily occupied under a tent, making
the cross ready for our Lord's crucifixion. The enemies of Jesus had
given orders that the cross should be prepared directly after his
arrest, that they might without delay execute the sentence which they
hoped to persuade Pilate to pass on him. The Romans had already prepared
the crosses of the two thieves, and the workmen who were making that of
Jesus were much annoyed at being obliged to labour at it during the
night; they did not attempt to conceal their anger at this, and uttered
the most frightful oaths and curses, which pierced the heart of the
tender Mother of Jesus through and through; but she prayed for these
blind creatures who thus unknowingly blasphemed the Saviour who was
about to die for their salvation, and prepared the cross for his cruel
execution.

'Mary, John, and the holy women traversed the outer court attached to
Caiphas's house. They stopped under the archway of a door which opened
into the inner court. Mary's heart was with her Divine Son, and she
desired most ardently to see this door opened, that she might again have
a chance of beholding him, for she knew that it alone separated her from
the prison where he was confined. The door was at length opened, and
Peter rushed out, his face covered with his mantle, wringing his hands,
and weeping bitterly. By the light of the torches he soon recognised
John and the Blessed Virgin, but the sight of them only renewed those
dreadful feelings of remorse

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

which the look of Jesus had awakened in his breast, Mary approached him
instantly, and said, 'Simon, tell me, I entreat you, what is become of
Jesus, my Son!' These words pierced his very heart; he could not even
look at her, but turned away, and again wrung his hands. Mary drew close
to him, and said in a voice trembling with emotion: 'Simon, son of John,
why dost thou not answer me?'--'Mother!' exclaimed Peter, in a dejected
tone, 'O, Mother, speak not to me--thy Son is suffering more than words
can express: speak not to me! They have condemned him to death, and I
have denied him. three times.' John came up to ask a few more questions,
but Peter ran out of the court as if beside himself, and did not stop
for a single moment until he reached the cave at Mount Olivet--that cave
on the stones o which the impression of the hands of our Saviour had b
en miraculously left. I believe it is the cave in which Adam took refuge
to weep after his fall.

The Blessed Virgin was inexpressibly grieved at hearing of the fresh
pang inflicted on the loving heart of her Divine Son, the pang of
hearing himself denied by that disciple who had first acknowledged him
as the Son of the Living God; she was unable to support herself, and
fell down on the door-stone, upon which the impression of her feet and
hands remains to the present day. I have seen the stones, which are
preserved somewhere, but I cannot at this moment remember where. The
door was not again shut, for the crowd was dispersing, and when the
Blessed Virgin came to herself, she begged to be taken to some place as
near as possible to her Divine Son. John, therefore, led her and the
holy women to the front of the prison where Jesus was confined. Mary was
with Jesus in spirit, and Jesus was with her; but this loving Mother
wished to hear with her own ears the voice of her Divine Son. She
listened and heard not only his moans, but also the abusive language of
those around him. It was impossible for the holy women to remain in the
court any longer without attracting attention. The grief of Magdalen was
so violent that she was unable to conceal

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

it; and although the Blessed Virgin, by a special grace from Almighty
God, maintained a calm and dignified exterior in the midst of her
sufferings, yet even she was recognised, and overheard harsh words, such
as these: '*Is not that the Mother of the Galilæan*? Her Son will most
certainly be executed, but not before the festival, unless, indeed, he
is the greatest of criminals.'

The Blessed Virgin left the court, and went up to the fireplace in the
vestibule, where a certain number of persons were still standing. When
she reached the spot where Jesus had said that he was the Son of God,
and the wicked Jews cried out, '*He is guilty of death*,' she again
fainted, and John and the holy women carried her away, in appearance
more like a corpse than a living person. The bystanders said not a word;
they seemed struck with astonishment, and silence, such as might have
been produced in hell by the passage of a celestial being, reigned in
that vestibule.

The holy women again passed the place where the cross was being
prepared; the workmen appeared to find as much difficulty in completing
it as the judges had found in pronouncing sentence, and were obliged to
fetch fresh wood every moment, for some bits would not fit, and others
split; this continued until the different species of wood were placed in
the cross according to the intentions of Divine Providence. I saw angels
who obliged these men to recommence their work, and who would not let
them rest, until all was accomplished in a proper manner; but my
remembrance of this vision is indistinct.
