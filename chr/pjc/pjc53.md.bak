# CHAPTER XXXIX.

### Erection of the Cross.

WHEN the executioners had finished the crucifixion of our Lord, they
tied ropes to the trunk of the cross, and fastened the ends of these
ropes round a long beam which was fixed firmly in the ground at a little
distance, and by means of these ropes they raised the cross. Some of
their number supported it while others shoved its foot towards the hole
prepared for its reception--the heavy cross fell into this hole with a
frightful shock--Jesus uttered a faint cry, and his wounds were torn
open in the most fearful manner, his blood again burst forth, and his
half dislocated bones knocked one against the other. The archers pushed
the cross to get it thoroughly into the hole, and caused it to vibrate
still more by planting five stakes around to support it.

A terrible, but at the same time a touching sight it was to behold the
cross raised up in the midst of the vast concourse of persons who were
assembled all around; not only insulting soldiers, proud Pharisees, and
the brutal Jewish mob were there, but likewise strangers from all parts.
The air resounded with acclamations and derisive cries when they beheld
it towering on high, and after vibrating for a moment in the air, fall
with a heavy crash into the hole cut for it in the rock. But words of
love and compassion resounded through the air at the same moment; and
need we say that these words, these sounds, were emitted by the most
saintly of human beings--Mary--John--the holy women, and all who were
pure of heart? They bowed down and adored the 'Word made flesh,' nailed
to the cross; they stretched forth their hands as if desirous of giving
assistance to the Holy of Holies, whom they beheld nailed to a cross and
in the power of his furious enemies. But when the solemn sound of the
fall of the cross into the hole prepared for it in the rock was heard, a
dead silence ensued, every heart was filled with an undefinable feeling
of awe--a feeling never before experienced, and for

which no one could account, even to himself; all the inmates of hell
shook with terror, and vented their rage by endeavouring to stimulate
the enemies of Jesus to still greater fury and brutality; the souls in
Limbo were filled with joy and hope, for the sound was to them a
harbinger of happiness, the prelude to the appearance of their
Deliverer. Thus was the blessed cross of our Lord planted for the first
time on the earth; and well might it be compared to the tree of life in
Paradise, for the wounds of Jesus were as sacred fountains, from which
flowed four rivers destined both to purify the world from the curse of
sin, and to give it fertility, so as to produce fruit unto salvation.

The eminence on which the cross was planted was about two feet higher
than the surrounding parts; the feet of Jesus were sufficiently near the
ground for his friends to be able to reach to kiss them, and his face
was turned to the north-west.
