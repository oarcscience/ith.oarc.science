by the Rev. Dr. Watts.
 HOW glorious is our heavenly King,
Who reigns above tha Sky!
How shall a Child presume to sing
His dreadful Majesty!
 How great his Power is none can tell,
Nor think how large his grace:
Nor men below, nor Saints that dwell,
On high before his Face.
 Nor Angels that stand round the Lord,
Can search his secret will;
But they perform his heav'nly Word,
And sing his Praises still.
 Then let me join this holy Train;
And my first Off'rings bring;
The eternal GOD will not disdain
To hear an Infant sing.
 My Heart resolves, my Tongue obeys,
And Angels shall rejoice,
To hear their mighty Maker's Praise,
Sound from a feeble Voice.</td>

THose days which God to me doth send, <br />
In pleasure I'm resolv'd to spend; <br />
Like as the birds in th' lovely spring, <br />
Sit chirping on the bough, and sing; <br />
Who straining forth those warbling notes, <br />
Do make sweet music in their throats, <br />
So I resolve in this my prime, <br />
In sports and plays to spend my time. <br />
Sorrow and grief I'll put away, <br />
Such things agree not with my day; </td>

Though parents grieve and me correct, <br />
Yet I their counsel will reject.

The resolution which you take, <br />
Sweet youth it doth me merry make. <br />
If thou my counsel wilt embrace, <br />
And shun the ways of truth and grace, <br />
And learn to lie, and curse and swear, <br />
And be as proud as any are; <br />
And with thy brothers wilt fall out, <br />
And fisters with vile language flout: <br />
Yea, fight and scratch, and also bite, <br />
Then in thee I will take delight. <br />
If thou wilt but be rul'd by me, <br />
An artist thou shalt quickly be, <br />
In all my ways which lovely are, <br />
Ther'e few with thee who shall compare. <br />
Thy parents always disobey; <br />
Don't mind at all what they do say: <br />
And also pout and sullen be, <br />
