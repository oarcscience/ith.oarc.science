OFFICES OF HUMANITY.

THOU shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide
thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy
brother.

And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or thou know him not, then
thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee
until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him agian.

In like manner shalt thou do with his ass, and so shalt thou do with his
raiment, and with all lost things of thy brother's, which he hath lost
and and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewse thou mayest not hide
thyself.

Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and
hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up
again.
