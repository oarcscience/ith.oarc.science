<I><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Of the Fear of God</I></FONT>.</P>
<FONT SIZE=5><P>T</FONT>HEY that fear God least, have the greatest reason to fear him.</P>
<P>A fear of departing from God is a good means to keep us from departing from him.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></P>
<P>The more we fear God, the less we shall fear men,</P>
<P>They that will not fear God in prosperity, will be afraid of him in adversity.</P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Means to preserve Mercies</I></FONT>.</P>
<P>1. BE thankful for them.<BR>
2. Receive them as mercies, not as dues.<BR>
3. Prepare to part with them.<BR>
4. Expect the continuance of mercies from God; he is the strength of our life, the staff of our bread, the breath of our nostrils, and the length of our days.</P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Of the Soul</I></FONT>.</P>
<P>IT matters not what a man loses, if he saves his soul; but if he loses his soul, it matters not what he saves.</P>
<P>They that are least sensible of their souls wants are most miserable.</P>
<P>It is our greatest wisdom to be watchful over the frame of our spirit--to observe what helps it and what injures it.</P>
<P>If you lose your time, you lose your hopes; and if you lose your hopes, you lose your souls; and when your souls are lost, they shall never be ransomed: when your hopes are lost, they shall never be recovered; and when your time is lost, it shall never be redeemed.</P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Of Death</P>
</I></FONT><P>THF longest life is a lingering death,<BR>
First infancy dies, then childhood, then youth.</P>
