you rest.

correction will drive it from him.

brinistone

of them all.

NOW is the accepted time; now is the day of salvation.

PRAY to thy Father who is in secret, and, thy Father who sees in secret
will reward thee openly.

QUIT you like men; be strong; stand fast in the faith.

REMEMBER thy Creator in the days of thy youth.

SALVATION belongeth unto the Lord.

TRUST in God at all times, ye people; pour out your hearts before him.

WOE to the wicked; it will be ill with him, for the reward of his hand
will be given  
him.

hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

YOUNG men, you have overcome the wicked one.
