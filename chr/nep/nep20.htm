<FONT SIZE=6><P>H</FONT>USH, my dear; lie still and slumber<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy angels guard thy bed;<BR>
Heavenly blessings, without number,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently falling on thy head.</P>
<P>Sleep, my babe! Thy food and raiment,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;House and home, thy friends provide,<BR>
All without thy care or payment;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All thy wants are well supplied.</P>
<P>How much better thou'rt attended<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the Son of God could be,<BR>
When from heaven he descended,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And became a child like thee!</P>
<P>Soft and easy is thy cradle;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Coarse and hard thy Savior lay,<BR>
When his birthplace was a stable,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his softest bed was hay.</P>
<P>Blessed Babe! what glorious features.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotless, fair, divinely bright! <A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A><BR>
Must he dwell with brutal creatures?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How could angels bear the sight?</P>
<P>Was there nothing but a manger<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed sinners could afford<BR>
To receive the heavenly Stranger?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did they thus affront the Lord?</P>
<P>Soft, my child! I did not chide thee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my song may sound too hard<BR>
'Tis thy mother sits beside thee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And her arms shall be thy guard.</P>
<P>Yet to read the shameful story,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Jews abused their King,<BR>
How they served the Lord of glory,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes me angry while I sing.</P>
<P>See the kinder shepherds round him,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling wonders from the sky;<BR>
There they sought him, there they found him,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his virgin mother by.</P>
<P>See the lovely Babe a-dressing--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely Infant! how he smiled!<BR>
When he wept, his mother's blessing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothed and hushed the holy Child.</P>
<P>Lo! he slumbers in a manger,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the horned oxen fed<BR>
Peace, my darling! here's no danger<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's no oxen near thy bed.</P>
<P>'Twas to save thee, child, from dying,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save my dear from burning flame,<BR>
Bitter groans and endless crying,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That thy blest Redeemer came.</P>
<P>May'st thou live to know and fear him,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust and love him, all thy days; <A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A><BR>
Then go dwell forever near him,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;See his face, and sing his praise.</P>
<P>I could give thee thousand kisses,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping what I most desire;<BR>
Not a mother's fondest wishes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can to greater joy aspire.</P></DIR>

<P>O GREAT Almighty God above,<BR>
Plant in my breast a fund of love,<BR>
That I thy mercies may adore,<BR>
And bless and praise thee evermore.</P></DIR>

<P>THE boy that's to his book inclined<BR>
Will soon a golden treasure find.</P></DIR>
