This was a standard reader in New England in the 18th and 19th
centuries. It was apparently used in both public and Sunday (religious)
schools. At that time children of all ages [studied in the same
classroom](nep01.md), so it has portions oriented towards younger and older
students.

Besides [instruction in the alphabet](nep06.md), the New England Primer
also served to indoctrinate young minds in the stern and [somewhat
morbid](nep12.md) Protestantism of that time and place. Depending on your
viewpoint, it is either yet another example of how religion has been
excised from the public schools in the United States, or a quaint sample
of what our forefathers considered acceptable as 'moral education'.

The New England Primer also has examples of religious intolerance,
specifically anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic statements, which reflect
then-contemporary attitudes.

This particular book went through a number of editions. This version was
scanned from an copy in the possession of my family which was published
in 1843. An earlier version, dated 1777, is also available
[here](1777/index.md).
