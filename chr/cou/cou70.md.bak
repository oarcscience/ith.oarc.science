### <span id="an_lxxi-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE FIVE AND SIXTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxxi-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxxi-p3"></span>Of the first secondary power, Imagination
by name; and of the works and the obedience of it unto Reason, before
Sin and after.

<span id="an_lxxi-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxxi-p5"></span>IMAGINATION is a power through the which we
portray all images of absent and present things, and both it and the
thing that it worketh in be contained in the Memory. Before ere man
sinned, was Imagination so obedient unto the Reason, to the which it is
as it were servant, that it ministered never to it any unordained image
of any bodily creature, or any fantasy of any ghostly creature: but now
it is not so. For unless it be refrained by the light of grace in the
Reason, else it will never cease, sleeping or waking, for to portray
<span id="an_lxxi-p5.1"></span><span id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span
id="an_lxxi-Page_281"></span> diverse unordained images of bodily
creatures; or else some fantasy, the which is nought else but a bodily
conceit of a ghostly thing, or else a ghostly conceit of a bodily thing.
And this is evermore feigned and false, and next unto error.

<span id="an_lxxi-p6"></span>This inobedience of the Imagination may
clearly be conceived in them that be newlings turned from the world unto
devotion, in the time of their prayer. For before the time be, that the
Imagination be in great part refrained by the light of grace in the
Reason, as it is in continual meditation of ghostly things—as be their
own wretchedness, the passion and the kindness of our Lord God, with
many such other—they may in nowise put away the wonderful and the
diverse thoughts, fantasies, and images, the which be ministered and
printed in their mind by the light of the curiosity of Imagination. And
all this inobedience is the pain of the original sin. <span
