### <span id="an_lxix-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE THREE AND SIXTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxix-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxix-p3"></span>Of the powers of a soul in general, and how
Memory in special is a principal power, comprehending in it all the
other powers and all those things in the which they work.

<span id="an_lxix-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxix-p5"></span>MEMORY is such a power in itself, that
properly to speak and in manner, it worketh not itself. But Reason and
Will, they be two working powers, and so is Imagination and Sensuality
also. And all these four powers and their works, Memory containeth and
comprehendeth in itself. And otherwise it is not said that the Memory
worketh, unless such a comprehension be a work.

<span id="an_lxix-p6"></span>And therefore it is that I call the powers
of a soul, some principal, and <span id="an_lxix-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_276">p. 276</span> <span id="an_lxix-Page_276"></span> some
secondary. Not because a soul is divisible, for that may not be: but
because all those things in the which they work be divisible, and some
principal, as be all ghostly things, and some secondary, as be all
bodily things. The two principal working powers, Reason and Will, work
purely in themselves in all ghostly things, without help of the other
two secondary powers. Imagination and Sensuality work beastly in all
bodily things, whether they be present or absent, in the body and with
the bodily wits. But by them, without help of Reason and of Will, may a
soul never come to for to know the virtue and the conditions of bodily
creatures, nor the cause of their beings and their makings.

<span id="an_lxix-p7"></span>And for this cause is Reason and Will
called principal powers, for they work in pure spirit without any manner
of bodilyness: and Imagination and Sensuality secondary, for they work
in the body with bodily instruments, <span
id="an_lxix-p7.1"></span><span id="page_277">p. 277</span> <span
id="an_lxix-Page_277"></span> the which be our five wits. Memory is
called a principal power, for it containeth in it ghostly not only all
the other powers, but thereto all those things in the which they work.
See by the proof. <span id="an_lxix-p7.2"></span><span id="page_278">p.
278</span> <span id="an_lxix-Page_278"></span>
