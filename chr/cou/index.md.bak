This is Evelyn Underhill's translation of the medieval spiritual
guidebook called The Cloud of Unknowing, written by an anonymous English
monk. At the core is a mystical approach to Christian prayer, in which
God is found not through rote knowledge, but through 'blind love.' It
has been described as Christianity with a Zen outlook. --J.B. Hare
