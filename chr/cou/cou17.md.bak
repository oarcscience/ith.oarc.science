### <span id="an_xviii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE TWELFTH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xviii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xviii-p3"></span>That by Virtue of this word sin is not
only destroyed, but also Virtues begotten.

<span id="an_xviii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xviii-p5"></span>AND, therefore, if thou wilt stand and not
fall, cease never in thine intent: but beat evermore on this cloud of
unknowing that is betwixt thee and thy God with a sharp dart of longing
love, and loathe for to think on aught under God, and go not thence for
anything that befalleth. For this is only by itself that work that
destroyeth the ground and the root of sin. Fast thou never so much, wake
thou never so long, rise thou never so early, lie thou never so hard,
wear thou never so sharp; yea, and if it were lawful to do—as it is
not—put thou out thine eyes, cut thou out thy tongue of thy mouth, stop
thou thine ears and thy <span id="an_xviii-p5.1"></span><span
id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span id="an_xviii-Page_114"></span> nose
never so fast, though thou shear away thy members, and do all the pain
to thy body that thou mayest or canst think: all this would help thee
right nought. Yet will stirring and rising of sin be in thee.

<span id="an_xviii-p6"></span>Yea, and what more? Weep thou never so
much for sorrow of thy sins, or of the Passion of Christ, or have thou
never so much mind of the joys of heaven, what may it do to thee? Surely
much good, much help, much profit, and much grace will it get thee. But
in comparison of this blind stirring of love, it is but a little that it
doth, or may do, without this. This by itself is the best part of Mary
without these other. They without it profit but little or nought. It
destroyeth not only the ground and the root of sin as it may be here,
but thereto it getteth virtues. For an it be truly conceived, all
virtues shall truly be, and perfectly conceived, and feelingly
comprehended, in it, without any mingling of the intent. And have a man
never so many virtues <span id="an_xviii-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span id="an_xviii-Page_115"></span> without
it, all they be mingled with some crooked intent, for the which they be
imperfect.

<span id="an_xviii-p7"></span>For virtue is nought else but an ordained
and a measured affection, plainly directed unto God for Himself. For
why? He in Himself is the pure cause of all virtues: insomuch, that if
any man be stirred to any one virtue by any other cause mingled with
Him, yea, although that He be the chief, yet that virtue is then
imperfect. As thus by example may be seen in one virtue or two instead
of all the other; and well may these two virtues be meekness and
charity. For whoso might get these two clearly, him needeth no more: for
why, he hath all. <span id="an_xviii-p7.1"></span><span id="page_116">p.

and when it is imperfect.](cou18.md)
