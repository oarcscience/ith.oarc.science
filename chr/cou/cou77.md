### <span id="an_lxxviii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE TWO AND SEVENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxxviii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxxviii-p3"></span>That a worker in this work should not
deem nor think of another worker as he feeleth in himself.

<span id="an_lxxviii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxxviii-p5"></span>LO! hereby mayest thou see that he that
may not come for to see and feel the perfection of this work but by long
travail, and yet is it but seldom, may lightly be deceived if he speak,
think, and deem other men as he feeleth in himself, that they may not
come to it but seldom, and that not without great travail. And on the
same manner may he be deceived that may have it when he will, if he deem
all other thereafter; saying that they may have it when they will. Let
be this: nay, surely he may not think thus. For peradventure, when it

that may not at the first time have it but seldom, and that not without
great travail, sithen after they shall have it when they will, as oft as
them liketh. Ensample of this we have of Moses, that first but seldom,
and not without great travail, in the mount might not see the manner of
the Ark: and sithen after, as oft as by him liked, saw it in the Veil.

[Next: Chapter 73: How that after the likeness of Moses, of Bezaleel and
of Aaron meddling them about the Ark of the Testament, we profit on
three manners in this grace of contemplation, for this grace is figured
in that Ark](cou78)
