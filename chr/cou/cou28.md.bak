### <span id="an_xxix-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE THREE AND TWENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxix-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxix-p3"></span>How God will answer and purvey for them in
spirit, that for business about His love list not answer nor purvey for
themselves

<span id="an_xxix-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxix-p5"></span>AND truly an we will lustily conform our
love and our living, inasmuch as in us is, by grace and by counsel, unto
the love and the living of Mary, no doubt but He shall answer on the
same manner now for us ghostly each day, privily in the hearts of all
those that either say or think against us. I say not but that evermore
some men shall say or think somewhat against us, the whiles we live in
the travail of this life, as they did against Mary. But I say, an we
will give no more heed to their saying nor to their <span
id="an_xxix-p5.1"></span><span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span
id="an_xxix-Page_152"></span> thinking, nor no more cease of our ghostly
privy work for their words and their thoughts, than she did—I say, then,
that our Lord shall answer them in spirit, if it shall be well with them
that so say and so think, that they shall within few days have shame of
their words and their thoughts.

<span id="an_xxix-p6"></span>And as He will answer for us thus in
spirit, so will He stir other men in spirit to give us our needful
things that belong to this life, as meat and clothes with all these
other; if He see that we will not leave the work of His love for
business about them. And this I say in confusion of their error, that
say that it is not lawful for men to set them to serve God in
contemplative life, but if they be secure before of their bodily
necessaries. For they say, that God sendeth the cow, but not by the
horn. And truly they say wrong of God, as they well know. For trust
steadfastly, thou whatsoever that thou be, that truly turnest thee from
the world unto God, that one of these <span
id="an_xxix-p6.1"></span><span id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span
id="an_xxix-Page_153"></span> two God shall send thee, without business
of thyself: and that is either abundance of necessaries, or strength in
body and patience in spirit to bear need. What then recketh it, which
man have? for all come to one in very contemplatives. And whoso is in
doubt of this, either the devil is in his breast and reeveth him of
belief, or else he is not yet truly turned to God as he should be; make
he it never so quaint, nor never so holy reasons shew there again,
whatnot ever that he be.

<span id="an_xxix-p7"></span>And therefore thou, that settest thee to be
contemplative as Mary was, choose thee rather to be meeked under the
wonderful height and the worthiness of God, the which is perfect, than
under thine own wretchedness, the which is imperfect: that is to say,
look that thy special beholding be more to the worthiness of God than to
thy wretchedness. For to them that be perfectly meeked, no thing shall
defail; neither bodily thing, nor ghostly. For <span
id="an_xxix-p7.1"></span><span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="an_xxix-Page_154"></span> why? They have God, in whom is all plenty;
and whoso hath Him—yea, as this book telleth—him needeth nought else in
this life. <span id="an_xxix-p7.2"></span><span id="page_155">p.
155</span> <span id="an_xxix-Page_155"></span>
