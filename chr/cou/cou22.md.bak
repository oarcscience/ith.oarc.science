### <span id="an_xxiii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxiii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxiii-p3"></span>That a Very contemplative list not meddle
him with active life, nor of anything that is done or spoken about him,
nor yet to answer to his blamers in excusing of himself.

<span id="an_xxiii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxiii-p5"></span>IN the gospel of Saint Luke it is written,
that when our Lord was in the house of Martha her sister, all the time
that Martha made her busy about the dighting of His meat, Mary her
sister sat at His feet. And in hearing of His word she beheld not to the
business of her sister, although her business was full good and full
holy, for truly it is the first part of active life; nor yet to the
preciousness of His blessed body, nor to the sweet voice and the words
of His manhood, although it is better and holier, for <span
id="an_xxiii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span
id="an_xxiii-Page_132"></span> it is the second part of active life and
the first of contemplative life.

<span id="an_xxiii-p6"></span>But to the sovereignest wisdom of His
Godhead lapped in the dark words of His manhood, thither beheld she with
all the love of her heart. For from thence she would not remove, for
nothing that she saw nor heard spoken nor done about her; but sat full
still in her body, with many a sweet privy and a listy love pressed upon
that high cloud of unknowing betwixt her and her God. For one thing I
tell thee, that there was never yet pure creature in this life, nor
never yet shall be, so high ravished in contemplation and love of the
Godhead, that there is not evermore a high and a wonderful cloud of
unknowing betwixt him and his God. In this cloud it was that Mary was
occupied with many a privy love pressed. And why? Because it was the
best and the holiest part of contemplation that may be in this life, and
from this part her list not remove for nothing. Insomuch, that when
<span id="an_xxiii-p6.1"></span><span id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span
id="an_xxiii-Page_133"></span> her sister Martha complained to our Lord
of her, and bade Him bid her sister rise and help her and let her not so
work and travail by herself, she sat full still and answered not with
one word, nor shewed not as much as a grumbling gesture against her
sister for any plaint that she could make. And no wonder: for why, she
had another work to do that Martha wist not of. And therefore she had no
leisure to listen to her, nor to answer her at her plaint.

<span id="an_xxiii-p7"></span>Lo! friend, all these works, these words,
and these gestures, that were shewed betwixt our Lord and these two
sisters, be set in ensample of all actives and all contemplatives that
have been since in Holy Church, and shall be to the day of doom. For by
Mary is understood all contemplatives; for they should conform their
living after hers. And by Martha, actives on the same manner; and for
the same reason in likeness. <span id="an_xxiii-p7.1"></span><span

[Next: Chapter 18: How that yet unto this day all actives complain of
contemplatives as Martha did of Mary. Of the which complaining ignorance
is the cause](cou23.md)
