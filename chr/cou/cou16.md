### <span id="an_xvii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xvii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xvii-p3"></span>That a man should weigh each thought and
each stirring after that it is, and always eschew recklessness in venial
sin.

<span id="an_xvii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xvii-p5"></span>I SAY not this for that I trow that thou,
or any other such as I speak of, be guilty and cumbered with any such
sins; but for that I would that thou weighest each thought and each
stirring after that it is, and for I would that thou travailedst busily
to destroy the first stirring and thought of these things that thou
mayest thus sin in. For one thing I tell thee; that who weigheth not, or
setteth little by, the first thought—yea, although it be no sin unto
him—that he, whosoever that he be, shall not eschew recklessness in
venial sin. Venial sin shall no man utterly eschew in this deadly life.
But <span id="an_xvii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_112">p. 112</span>
<span id="an_xvii-Page_112"></span> recklessness in venial sin should
always be eschewed of all the true disciples of perfection; and else I
have no wonder though they soon sin deadly. <span

destroyed, but also virtues begotten.](cou17)
