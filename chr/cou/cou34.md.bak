### <span id="an_xxxv-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE NINE AND TWENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxxv-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxxv-p3"></span>That a man should bidingly travail in this
work, and suffer the pain thereof, and judge no man.

<span id="an_xxxv-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxxv-p5"></span>AND therefore, whoso coveteth to come to
cleanness that he lost for sin, and to win to that well‑being where all
woe wanteth, him behoveth bidingly to travail in this work, and suffer
the pain thereof, whatsoever that he be: whether he have been an
accustomed sinner or none.

<span id="an_xxxv-p6"></span>All men have travail in this work; both
sinners, and innocents that never sinned greatly. But far greater
travail have those that have been sinners than they that have been none;
and that is great reason. Nevertheless, ofttimes it befalleth that some
that have been <span id="an_xxxv-p6.1"></span><span id="page_170">p.
170</span> <span id="an_xxxv-Page_170"></span> horrible and accustomed
sinners come sooner to the perfection of this work than those that have
been none. And this is the merciful miracle of our Lord, that so
specially giveth His grace, to the wondering of all this world. Now
truly I hope that on Doomsday it shall be fair, when that God shall be
seen clearly and all His gifts. Then shall some that now be despised and
set at little or nought as common sinners, and peradventure some that
now be horrible sinners, sit full seemly with saints in His sight: when
some of those that seem now full holy and be worshipped of men as
angels, and some of those yet peradventure, that never yet sinned
deadly, shall sit full sorry amongst hell caves.

<span id="an_xxxv-p7"></span>Hereby mayest thou see that no man should
be judged of other here in this life, for good nor for evil that they
do. Nevertheless deeds may lawfully be judged, but not the man, whether
they be good or evil. <span id="an_xxxv-p7.1"></span><span
