### <span id="an_xxxviii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE TWO AND THIRTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxxviii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxxviii-p3"></span>Of two ghostly devices that be helpful
to a ghostly beginner in the work of this book.

<span id="an_xxxviii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxxviii-p5"></span>NEVERTHELESS, somewhat of this subtlety
shall I tell thee as me think. Prove thou and do better, if thou better
mayest. Do that in thee is, to let be as thou wist not that they press
so fast upon thee betwixt thee and thy God. And try to look as it were
over their shoulders, seeking another thing: the which thing is God,
enclosed in a cloud of unknowing. And if thou do thus, I trow that
within short time thou shalt be eased of thy travail. I trow that an
this device be well and truly conceived, it is nought else but a longing
desire unto God, to feel Him <span id="an_xxxviii-p5.1"></span><span
id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span id="an_xxxviii-Page_175"></span> and
see Him as it may be here: and such a desire is charity, and it
obtaineth always to be eased.

<span id="an_xxxviii-p6"></span>Another device there is: prove thou if
thou wilt. When thou feelest that thou mayest on nowise put them down,
cower thou down under them as a caitiff and a coward overcome in battle,
and think that it is but a folly to thee to strive any longer with them,
and therefore thou yieldest thee to God in the hands of thine enemies.
And feel then thyself as thou wert foredone for ever. Take good heed of
this device I pray thee, for me think in the proof of this device thou
shouldest melt all to water. And surely me think an this device be truly
conceived it is nought else but a true knowing and a feeling of thyself
as thou art, a wretch and a filthy, far worse than nought: the which
knowing and feeling is meekness. And this meekness obtaineth to have God
Himself mightily descending, to venge thee of thine enemies, for to take
<span id="an_xxxviii-p6.1"></span><span id="page_176">p. 176</span>
<span id="an_xxxviii-Page_176"></span> thee up, and cherishingly dry
thine ghostly eyen; as the father doth the child that is in point to
perish under the mouths of wild swine or wode biting bears. <span
id="an_xxxviii-p6.2"></span><span id="page_177">p. 177</span> <span

special sins and of the pain of them, and yet how there is no perfect
rest in this life](cou38.md)
