<span id="an_xxxi-p1"></span> 

### <span id="an_xxxi-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE FIVE AND TWENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxxi-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxxi-p3"></span>That in the time of this work a perfect
soul hath no special beholding to any one man in this life.

<span id="an_xxxi-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxxi-p5"></span>I SAY not that in this work he shall have a
special beholding to any man in this life, whether that he be friend or
foe, kin or stranger; for that may not be if this work shall perfectly
be done, as it is when all things under God be fully forgotten, as
falleth for this work. But I say that he shall be made so virtuous and
so charitable by the virtue of this work, that his will shall be
afterwards, when he condescendeth to commune or to pray for his
even‑christian—not from all this work, for that may not be without great
sin, but from the height of this <span id="an_xxxi-p5.1"></span><span
id="page_159">p. 159</span> <span id="an_xxxi-Page_159"></span> work,
the which is speedful and needful to do some time as charity asketh—as
specially then directed to his foe as to his friend, his stranger as his
kin. Yea, and some time more to his foe than to his friend.

<span id="an_xxxi-p6"></span>Nevertheless, in this work he hath no
leisure to look after who is his friend or his foe, his kin or his
stranger. I say not but he shall feel some time—yea, full oft—his
affection more homely to one, two, or three, than to all these other:
for that is lawful to be, for many causes as charity asketh. For such an
homely affection felt Christ to John and unto Mary, and unto Peter
before many others. But I say, that in the time of this work shall all
be equally homely unto him; for he shall feel then no cause, but only
God. So that all shall be loved plainly and nakedly for God, and as well
as himself.

<span id="an_xxxi-p7"></span>For as all men were lost in Adam and all
men that with work will witness their will of salvation are saved or
<span id="an_xxxi-p7.1"></span><span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="an_xxxi-Page_160"></span> shall be by virtue of the Passion of only
Christ: not in the same manner, but as it were in the same manner, a
soul that is perfectly disposed to this work, and oned thus to God in
spirit as the proof of this work witnesseth, doth that in it is to make
all men as perfect in this work as itself is. For right as if a limb of
our body feeleth sore, all the tother limbs be pained and diseased
therefore, or if a limb fare well, all the remnant be gladded
therewith—right so is it ghostly of all the limbs of Holy Church. For
Christ is our head, and we be the limbs if we be in charity: and whoso
will be a perfect disciple of our Lord’s, him behoveth strain up his
spirit in this work ghostly, for the salvation of all his brethren and
sisters in nature, as our Lord did His body on the Cross. And how? Not
only for His friends and His kin and His homely lovers, but generally
for all mankind, without any special beholding more to one than to
another. For all that will leave sin <span
id="an_xxxi-p7.2"></span><span id="page_161">p. 161</span> <span
id="an_xxxi-Page_161"></span> and ask mercy shall be saved through the
virtue of His Passion. And as it is said of meekness and charity, so it
is to be understood of all other virtues. For all they be truly
comprehended in this little pressing of love, touched before. <span

[Next: Chapter 26: That without full special grace, or long use in
common grace, the work of this book is right travailous; and in this
work, which is the work of the soul helped by grace, and which is the
work of only God](cou31.md)
