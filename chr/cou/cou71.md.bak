### <span id="an_lxxii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SIX AND SIXTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxxii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxxii-p3"></span>

<span id="an_lxxii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxxii-p5"></span>SENSUALITY is a power of our soul, recking
and reigning in the bodily wits, through the which we have bodily
knowing and feeling of all bodily creatures, whether they be pleasing or
unpleasing. And it hath two parts: one through the which it beholdeth to
the needfulness of our body, another through the which it serveth to the
lusts of the bodily wits. For this same power is it, that grumbleth when
the body lacketh the needful things unto it, and that in the taking of
the need stirreth us to take more than needeth in feeding <span
id="an_lxxii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span
id="an_lxxii-Page_283"></span> and furthering of our lusts: that
grumbleth in lacking of pleasing creatures, and lustily is delighted in
their presence: that grumbleth in presence of misliking creatures, and
is lustily pleased in their absence. Both this power and the thing that
it worketh in be contained in the Memory.

<span id="an_lxxii-p6"></span>Before ere man sinned was the Sensuality
so obedient unto the Will, unto the which it is as it were servant, that
it ministered never unto it any unordained liking or grumbling in any
bodily creature, or any ghostly feigning of liking or misliking made by
any ghostly enemy in the bodily wits. But now it is not so: for unless
it be ruled by grace in the Will, for to suffer meekly and in measure
the pain of the original sin, the which it feeleth in absence of needful
comforts and in presence of speedful discomforts, and thereto also for
to restrain it from lust in presence of needful comforts, and from lusty
plesaunce in the absence <span id="an_lxxii-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span id="an_lxxii-Page_284"></span> of
speedful discomforts: else will it wretchedly and wantonly welter, as a
swine in the mire, in the wealths of this world and the foul flesh so
much that all our living shall be more beastly and fleshly, than either
manly or ghostly. <span id="an_lxxii-p6.2"></span><span id="page_285">p.

manner of her working, may lightly be deceived in understanding of
ghostly words and of ghostly working; and how a soul is made a God in
grace](cou72.md)
