### <span id="an_lxxix-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE THREE AND SEVENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxxix-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxxix-p3"></span>How that after the likeness of Moses, of
Bezaleel, and of Aaron meddling them about the Ark of the Testament, we
profit on three manners in this grace of contemplation, for this grace
is figured in that Ark.

<span id="an_lxxix-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxxix-p5"></span>THREE men there were that most principally
meddled them with this Ark of the Old Testament: Moses, Bezaleel, Aaron.
Moses learned in the mount of our Lord how it should be made. Bezaleel
wrought it and made it in the Veil after the ensample that was shewed in
the mountain. And Aaron had it in keeping in the Temple, to feel it and
see it as oft as him liked.

<span id="an_lxxix-p6"></span>At the likeness of these three, we profit
on three manners in this grace <span id="an_lxxix-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span id="an_lxxix-Page_306"></span> of
contemplation. Sometime we profit only by grace, and then we be likened
unto Moses, that for all the climbing and the travail that he had into
the mount might not come to see it but seldom: and yet was that sight
only by the shewing of our Lord when Him liked to shew it, and not for
any desert of his travail. Sometime we profit in this grace by our own
ghostly cunning, helped with grace, and then be we likened to Bezaleel,
the which might not see the Ark ere the time that he had made it by his
own travail, helped with the ensample that was shewed unto Moses in the
mount. And sometime we profit in this grace by other men’s teaching, and
then be we likened to Aaron, the which had it in keeping and in custom
to see and feel the Ark when him pleased, that Bezaleel had wrought and
made ready before to his hands.

<span id="an_lxxix-p7"></span>Lo! ghostly friend, in this work, though
it be childishly and lewdly spoken, I bear, though I be a wretch <span
id="an_lxxix-p7.1"></span><span id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span
id="an_lxxix-Page_307"></span> unworthy to teach any creature, the
office of Bezaleel: making and declaring in manner to thine hands the
manner of this ghostly Ark. But far better and more worthily than I do,
thou mayest work if thou wilt be Aaron: that is to say, continually
working therein for thee and for me. Do then so I pray thee, for the
love of God Almighty. And since we be both called of God to work in this
work, I beseech thee for God’s love fulfil in thy part what lacketh of
mine. <span id="an_lxxix-p7.2"></span><span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

[Next: Chapter 74: How that the matter of this book is never more read
or spoken, nor heard read or spoken, of a soul disposed thereto without
feeling of a very accordance to the effect of the same work: and of
rehearsing of the same charge that is written in the prologue](cou79.md)
