### <span id="an_lvii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE ONE AND FIFTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lvii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lvii-p3"></span>That men should have great wariness so that
they understand not bodily a thing that is meant ghostly; and specially
it is good to be wary in understanding of this word “in,” and of this
word “up.”

<span id="an_lvii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lvii-p5"></span>AND therefore lean meekly to this blind
stirring of love in thine heart. I mean not in thy bodily heart, but in
thy ghostly heart, the which is thy will. And be well wary that thou
conceive not bodily that that is said ghostly. For truly I tell thee,
that bodily and fleshly conceits of them that have curious and
imaginative wits be cause of much error.

<span id="an_lvii-p6"></span>Ensample of this mayest thou see, by that
that I bid thee hide thy desire from God in that that in thee is. For
peradventure an I had bidden thee <span id="an_lvii-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span id="an_lvii-Page_234"></span> shew thy
desire unto God, thou shouldest have conceived it more bodily than thou
dost now, when I bid thee hide it. For thou wottest well, that all that
thing that is wilfully hidden, it is cast into the deepness of spirit.
And thus me thinketh that it needeth greatly to have much wariness in
understanding of words that be spoken to ghostly intent, so that thou
conceive them not bodily but ghostly, as they be meant: and specially it
is good to be wary with this word *in,* and this word *up.* For in
misconceiving of these two words hangeth much error, and much deceit in
them that purpose them to be ghostly workers, as me thinketh. Somewhat
wot I by the proof, and somewhat by hearsay; and of these deceits list
me tell thee a little as me thinketh.

<span id="an_lvii-p7"></span>A young disciple in God’s school new turned
from the world, the same weeneth that for a little time that he hath
given him to penance and to prayer, taken by counsel in confession,
<span id="an_lvii-p7.1"></span><span id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span
id="an_lvii-Page_235"></span> that he be therefore able to take upon him
ghostly working of the which he heareth men speak or read about him, or
peradventure readeth himself. And therefore when they read or hear
spoken of ghostly working—and specially of this word, “how a man shall
draw all his wit within himself,” or “how he shall climb above
himself”—as fast for blindness in soul, and for fleshliness and
curiosity of natural wit, they misunderstand these words, and ween,
because they find in them a natural covetyse to hid things, that they be
therefore called to that work by grace. Insomuch, that if counsel will
not accord that they shall work in this work, as soon they feel a manner
of grumbling against their counsel, and think—yea and peradventure say
to such other as they be—that they can find no man that can wit what
they mean fully. And therefore as fast, for boldness and presumption of
their curious wit, they leave meek prayer and penance over <span
id="an_lvii-p7.2"></span><span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="an_lvii-Page_236"></span> soon; and set them, they ween, to a full
ghostly work within in their soul. The which work, an it be truly
conceived, is neither bodily working nor ghostly working; and shortly to
say, it is a working against nature, and the devil is the chief worker
thereof. And it is the readiest way to death of body and of soul, for it
is madness and no wisdom, and leadeth a man even to madness. And yet
they ween not thus: for they purpose them in this work to think on
nought but on God. <span id="an_lvii-p7.3"></span><span id="page_237">p.
237</span> <span id="an_lvii-Page_237"></span>
