### <span id="an_lxx-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE FOUR AND SIXTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxx-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxx-p3"></span>Of the other two principal powers Reason and
Will; and of the work of them before sin and after.

<span id="an_lxx-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxx-p5"></span>REASON is a power through the which we
depart the evil from the good, the evil from the worse, the good from
the better, the worse from the worst, the better from the best. Before
ere man sinned, might Reason have done all this by nature. But now it is
so blinded with the original sin, that it may not con work this work,
unless it be illumined by grace. And both the self Reason, and the thing
that it worketh in, be comprehended and contained in the Memory.

<span id="an_lxx-p6"></span>Will is a power through the which we choose
good, after that it be determined <span id="an_lxx-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span id="an_lxx-Page_279"></span> with
Reason; and through the which we love good, we desire good, and rest us
with full liking and consent endlessly in God. Before ere man sinned,
might not Will be deceived in his choosing, in his loving, nor in none
of his works. For why, it had then by nature to savour each thing as it
was; but now it may not do so, unless it be anointed with grace. For
ofttimes because of infection of the original sin, it savoureth a thing
for good that is full evil, and that hath but the likeness of good. And
both the Will and the thing that is willed, the Memory containeth and
comprehendeth in it. <span id="an_lxx-p6.2"></span><span

and of the works and of the obedience of it unto Reason, before sin and
