### <span id="an_xxxvii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE ONE AND THIRTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxxvii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxxvii-p3"></span>How a man should have him in beginning of
this work against all thoughts and stirrings of sin.

<span id="an_xxxvii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxxvii-p5"></span>AND from the time that thou feelest that
thou hast done that in thee is, lawfully to amend thee at the doom of
Holy Church, then shalt thou set thee sharply to work in this work. And
then if it so be that thy foredone special deeds will always press in
thy remembrance betwixt thee and thy God, or any new thought or stirring
of any sin either, thou shalt stalwartly step above them with a fervent
stirring of love, and tread them down under thy feet. And try to cover
them with a thick cloud of forgetting, as they never had been done in
this life of thee <span id="an_xxxvii-p5.1"></span><span
id="page_173">p. 173</span> <span id="an_xxxvii-Page_173"></span> nor of
other man either. And if they oft rise, oft put them down: and shortly
to say, as oft as they rise, as oft put them down. And if thee think
that the travail be great, thou mayest seek arts and wiles and privy
subtleties of ghostly devices to put them away: the which subtleties be
better learned of God by the proof than of any man in this life. <span
