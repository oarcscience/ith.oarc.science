### <span id="an_xlviii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE TWO AND FORTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xlviii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xlviii-p3"></span>That by indiscretion in this, men shall
keep discretion in all other things; and surely else never

<span id="an_xlviii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xlviii-p5"></span>BUT peradventure thou askest me, how thou
shalt govern thee discreetly in meat and in sleep, and in all these
other. And hereto I think to answer thee right shortly: “Get that thou
get mayest.” Do this work evermore without ceasing and without
discretion, and thou shalt well ken begin and cease in all other works
with a great discretion. For I may not trow that a soul continuing in
this work night and day without discretion, should err in any of these
outward doings; and else, me think that he should always err. <span

<span id="an_xlviii-p6"></span>And therefore, an I might get a waking
and a busy beholding to this ghostly work within in my soul, I would
then have a heedlessness in eating and in drinking, in sleeping and in
speaking, and in all mine outward doings. For surely I trow I should
rather come to discretion in them by such a heedlessness, than by any
busy beholding to the same things, as I would by that beholding set a
mark and a measure by them. Truly I should never bring it so about, for
ought that I could do or say. Say what men say will, and let the proof
witness. And therefore lift up thine heart with a blind stirring of
love; and mean now sin, and now God. God wouldest thou have, and sin
wouldest thou lack. God wanteth thee; and sin art thou sure of. Now good
God help thee, for now hast thou need! <span

must needs be lost if the perfection of this work shall verily be felt
in any soul in this life](cou48)
