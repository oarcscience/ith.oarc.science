### <span id="an_xxxix-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE THREE AND THIRTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxxix-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxxix-p3"></span>That in this work a soul is cleansed both
of his special sins and of the pain of them, and yet how there is no
perfect rest in this life.

<span id="an_xxxix-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxxix-p5"></span>MORE devices tell I thee not at this time;
for an thou have grace to feel the proof of these, I trow that thou
shalt know better to learn me than I thee. For although it should be
thus, truly yet me think that I am full far therefrom. And therefore I
pray thee help me, and do thou for thee and for me.

<span id="an_xxxix-p6"></span>Do on then, and travail fast awhile, I
pray thee, and suffer meekly the pain if thou mayest not soon win to
these arts. For truly it is thy purgatory, and then when thy pain is all
<span id="an_xxxix-p6.1"></span><span id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span
id="an_xxxix-Page_178"></span> passed and thy devices be given of God,
and graciously gotten in custom; then it is no doubt to me that thou art
cleansed not only of sin, but also of the pain of sin. I mean, of the
pain of thy special foredone sins, and not of the pain of the original
sin. For that pain shall always last on thee to thy death day, be thou
never so busy. Nevertheless, it shall but little provoke thee, in
comparison of this pain of thy special sins; and yet shalt thou not be
without great travail. For out of this original sin will all day spring
new and fresh stirrings of sin: the which thee behoveth all day to smite
down, and be busy to shear away with a sharp double‑edged dreadful sword
of discretion. And hereby mayest thou see and learn, that there is no
soothfast security, nor yet no true rest in this life.

<span id="an_xxxix-p7"></span>Nevertheless, herefore shalt thou not go
back, nor yet be overfeared of thy failing. For an it so be that thou
mayest have grace to destroy the pain <span
id="an_xxxix-p7.1"></span><span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="an_xxxix-Page_179"></span> of thine foredone special deeds, in the
manner before said—or better if thou better mayest—sure be thou, that
the pain of the original sin, or else the new stirrings of sin that be
to come, shall but right little be able to provoke thee. <span
