### <span id="an_lxvi-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SIXTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxvi-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxvi-p3"></span>That the high and the next way to heaven is
run by desires, and not by paces of feet.

<span id="an_lxvi-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxvi-p5"></span>BUT now peradventure thou sayest, that how
should it then be? For thee thinkest that thou hast very evidence that
heaven is upwards; for Christ ascended the air bodily upwards, and sent
the Holy Ghost as He promised coming from above bodily, seen of all His
disciples; and this is our belief. And therefore thee thinkest since
thou hast thus very evidence, why shalt thou not direct thy mind upward
bodily in the time of thy prayer?

<span id="an_lxvi-p6"></span>And to this will I answer thee so feebly as
I can, and say: since it so was, that Christ should ascend bodily <span
id="an_lxvi-p6.1"></span><span id="page_268">p. 268</span> <span
id="an_lxvi-Page_268"></span> and thereafter send the Holy Ghost bodily,
then it was more seemly that it was upwards and from above than either
downwards and from beneath, behind, or before, on one side or on other.
But else than for this seemliness, Him needed never the more to have
went upwards than downwards; I mean for nearness of the way. For heaven
ghostly is as nigh down as up, and up as down: behind as before, before
as behind, on one side as other. Insomuch, that whoso had a true desire
for to be at heaven, then that same time he were in heaven ghostly. For
the high and the next way thither is run by desires, and not by paces of
feet. And therefore saith Saint Paul of himself and many other thus;
although our bodies be presently here in earth, nevertheless yet our
living is in heaven. He meant their love and their desire, the which is
ghostly their life. And surely as verily is a soul there where it
loveth, as in the body that Doeth by it and to the which <span
id="an_lxvi-p6.2"></span><span id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span
id="an_lxvi-Page_269"></span> it giveth life. And therefore if we will
go to heaven ghostly, it needeth not to strain our spirit neither up nor
down, nor on one side nor on other. <span id="an_lxvi-p6.3"></span><span
id="page_270">p. 270</span> <span id="an_lxvi-Page_270"></span>

and is ruled thereafter by the course of nature, and not
contrariwise](cou66.md)
