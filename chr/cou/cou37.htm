<p><A NAME="an_xxxviii-p2"></A>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_xxxviii-p3"></A>Of two ghostly devices that be helpful to a ghostly beginner in the work of this book.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_xxxviii-p5"></A>NEVERTHELESS, somewhat of this subtlety shall I tell thee as me think. Prove thou and do better, if thou better mayest. Do that in thee is, to let be as thou wist not that they press so fast upon thee betwixt thee and thy God. And try to look as it were over their shoulders, seeking another thing: the which thing is God, enclosed in a cloud of unknowing. And if thou do thus, I trow that within short time thou shalt be eased of thy travail. I trow that an this device be well and truly conceived, it is nought else but a longing desire unto God, to feel Him <A NAME="an_xxxviii-p5.1"></A><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A> <A NAME="an_xxxviii-Page_175"></A> and see Him as it may be here: and such a desire is charity, and it obtaineth always to be eased.</p>  
<p><A NAME="an_xxxviii-p6"></A>Another device there is: prove thou if thou wilt. When thou feelest that thou mayest on nowise put them down, cower thou down under them as a caitiff and a coward overcome in battle, and think that it is but a folly to thee to strive any longer with them, and therefore thou yieldest thee to God in the hands of thine enemies. And feel then thyself as thou wert foredone for ever. Take good heed of this device I pray thee, for me think in the proof of this device thou shouldest melt all to water. And surely me think an this device be truly conceived it is nought else but a true knowing and a feeling of thyself as thou art, a wretch and a filthy, far worse than nought: the which knowing and feeling is meekness. And this meekness obtaineth to have God Himself mightily descending, to venge thee of thine enemies, for to take <A NAME="an_xxxviii-p6.1"></A><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></A> <A NAME="an_xxxviii-Page_176"></A> thee up, and cherishingly dry thine ghostly eyen; as the father doth the child that is in point to perish under the mouths of wild swine or wode biting bears. <A NAME="an_xxxviii-p6.2"></A><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></A> <A NAME="an_xxxviii-Page_177"></A> </p>
