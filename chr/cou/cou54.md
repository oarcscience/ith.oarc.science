### <span id="an_lv-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE NINE AND FORTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lv-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lv-p3"></span>The substance of all perfection is nought
else but a good will; and how that all sounds and comfort and sweetness
that may befall in this life be to it but as it were accidents.

<span id="an_lv-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lv-p5"></span>AND therefore I pray thee, lean listily to
this meek stirring of love in thine heart, and follow thereafter: for it
will be thy guide in this life and bring thee to bliss in the tother. It
is the substance of all good living, and without it no good work may be
begun nor ended. It is nought else but a good and an according will unto
God, and a manner of well‑pleasedness and a gladness that thou feelest
in thy will of all that He doth.

<span id="an_lv-p6"></span>Such a good will is the substance <span
id="an_lv-p6.1"></span><span id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span
id="an_lv-Page_229"></span> of all perfection. All sweetness and
comforts, bodily or ghostly, be to this but as it were accidents, be
they never so holy; and they do but hang on this good will. Accidents I
call them, for they may be had and lacked without breaking asunder of
it. I mean in this life, but it is not so in the bliss of heaven; for
there shall they be oned with the substance without departing, as shall
the body in the which they work with the soul. So that the substance of
them here is but a good ghostly will. And surely I trow that he that
feeleth the perfection of this will, as it may be had here, there may no
sweetness nor no comfort fall to any man in this life, that he is not as
fain and as glad to lack it at God’s will, as to feel it and have it.
