### <span id="an_xvi-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE TENTH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xvi-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xvi-p3"></span>How a man shall know when his thought is no
sin; and if it be sin, when it is deadly and when it is venial.

<span id="an_xvi-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xvi-p5"></span>BUT it is not thus of the remembrance of any
man or woman living in this life, or of any bodily or worldly thing
whatsoever that it be. For why, a naked sudden thought of any of them,
pressing against thy will and thy witting, although it be no sin imputed
unto thee—for it is the pain of the original sin pressing against thy
power, of the which sin thou art cleansed in thy baptism—nevertheless
yet if this sudden stirring or thought be not smitten soon down, as fast
for frailty thy fleshly heart is strained thereby: with some manner of
liking, if it be a thing that pleaseth thee or <span
id="an_xvi-p5.1"></span><span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="an_xvi-Page_108"></span> hath pleased thee before, or else with some
manner of grumbling, if it be a thing that thee think grieveth thee, or
hath grieved thee before. The which fastening, although it may in
fleshly living men and women that be in deadly sin before be deadly;
nevertheless in thee and in all other that have in a true will forsaken
the world, and are obliged unto any degree in devout living in Holy
Church, what so it be, privy or open, and thereto that will be ruled not
after their own will and their own wit, but after the will and the
counsel of their sovereigns, what so they be, religious or seculars,
such a liking or a grumbling fastened in the fleshly heart is but venial
sin. The cause of this is the grounding and the rooting of your intent
in God, made in the beginning of your living in that state that ye stand
in, by the witness and the counsel of some discreet father.

<span id="an_xvi-p6"></span>But if it so be, that this liking or
grumbling fastened in thy fleshly heart <span
id="an_xvi-p6.1"></span><span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="an_xvi-Page_109"></span> be suffered so long to abide unreproved,
that then at the last it is fastened to the ghostly heart, that is to
say the will, with a full consent: then, it is deadly sin. And this
befalleth when thou or any of them that I speak of wilfully draw upon
thee the remembrance of any man or woman living in this life, or of any
bodily or worldly thing other: insomuch, that if it be a thing the which
grieveth or hath grieved thee before, there riseth in thee an angry
passion and an appetite of vengeance, the which is called Wrath. Or else
a fell disdain and a manner of loathsomeness of their person, with
despiteful and condemning thoughts, the which is called Envy. Or else a
weariness and an unlistiness of any good occupation bodily or ghostly,
the which is called Sloth.

<span id="an_xvi-p7"></span>And if it be a thing that pleaseth thee, or
hath pleased thee before, there riseth in thee a passing delight for to
think on that thing what so it be. Insomuch, <span
id="an_xvi-p7.1"></span><span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="an_xvi-Page_110"></span> that thou restest thee in that thought, and
finally fastenest thine heart and thy will thereto, and feedest thy
fleshly heart therewith: so that thee think for the time that thou
covetest none other wealth, but to live ever in such a peace and rest
with that thing that thou thinkest upon. If this thought that thou thus
drawest upon thee, or else receivest when it is put unto thee, and that
thou restest thee thus in with delight, be worthiness of nature or of
knowing, of grace or of degree, of favour or of fairhead, then it is
Pride. And if it be any manner of worldly good, riches or chattels, or
what that man may have or be lord of, then it is Covetyse. If it be
dainty meats and drinks, or any manner of delights that man may taste,
then it is Gluttony. And if it be love or plesaunce, or any manner of
fleshly dalliance, glosing or flattering of any man or woman living in
this life, or of thyself either: then it is Lechery. <span

stirring after that it is, and always eschew recklessness in venial
sin.](cou16.md)
