### <span id="an_xxiv-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE EIGHTEENTH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxiv-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxiv-p3"></span>How that yet unto this day all actives
complain of contemplatives as Martha did of Mary. Of the which
complaining ignorance is the cause.

<span id="an_xxiv-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxiv-p5"></span>AND right as Martha complained then on Mary
her sister, right so yet unto this day all actives complain of
contemplatives. For an there be a man or a woman in any company of this
world, what company soever it be, religious or seculars—I out‑take
none—the which man or woman, whichever that it be, feeleth him stirred
through grace and by counsel to forsake all outward business, and for to
set him fully for to live contemplative life after their cunning and
their conscience, their counsel according; as fast, their own brethren
and their sisters, and <span id="an_xxiv-p5.1"></span><span
id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span id="an_xxiv-Page_135"></span> all
their next friends, with many other that know not their stirrings nor
that manner of living that they set them to, with a great complaining
spirit shall rise upon them, and say sharply unto them that it is nought
that they do. And as fast they will reckon up many false tales, and many
true also, of falling of men and women that have given them to such life
before: and never a good tale of them that stood.

<span id="an_xxiv-p6"></span>I grant that many fall and have fallen of
them that have in likeness forsaken the world. And where they should
have become God’s servants and His contemplatives, because that they
would not rule them by true ghostly counsel they have become the devil’s
servants and his contemplatives; and turned either to hypocrites or to
heretics, or fallen into frenzies and many other mischiefs, in slander
of Holy Church. Of the which I leave to speak at this time, for
troubling of our matter. But nevertheless here <span
id="an_xxiv-p6.1"></span><span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="an_xxiv-Page_136"></span> after when God vouchsafeth and if need be,
men may see some of the conditions and the cause of their failings. And
therefore no more of them at this time; but forth of our matter. <span
id="an_xxiv-p6.2"></span><span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="an_xxiv-Page_137"></span>

teaching how all contemplatives should have all actives fully excused of
their complaining words and deeds](cou24.md)
