### <span id="an_lxiv-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE EIGHT AND FIFTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxiv-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxiv-p3"></span>That a man shall not take ensample of Saint
Martin and of Saint Stephen, for to strain his imagination bodily
upwards in the time of his prayer.

<span id="an_lxiv-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxiv-p5"></span>FOR that that they say of Saint Martin and
of Saint Stephen, although they saw such things with their bodily eyes,
it was shewed but in miracle and in certifying of thing that was
ghostly. For wit they right well that Saint Martin’s mantle came never
on Christ’s own body substantially, for no need that He had thereto to
keep Him from cold: but by miracle and in likeness for all us that be
able to be saved, that be oned to the body of Christ ghostly. And whoso
clotheth a poor man and doth any other good deed <span
id="an_lxiv-p5.1"></span><span id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span
id="an_lxiv-Page_258"></span> for God’s love bodily or ghostly to any
that hath need, sure be they they do it unto Christ ghostly: and they
shall be rewarded as substantially therefore as they had done it to
Christ’s own body. Thus saith Himself in the gospel. And yet thought He
it not enough, but if He affirmed it after by miracle; and for this
cause He shewed Him unto Saint Martin by revelation. All the revelations
that ever saw any man here in bodily likeness in this life, they have
ghostly bemeanings. And I trow that if they unto whom they were shewed
had been so ghostly, or could have conceived their bemeanings ghostly,
that then they had never been shewed bodily. And therefore let us pick
off the rough bark, and feed us off the sweet kernel.

<span id="an_lxiv-p6"></span>But how? Not as these heretics do, the
which be well likened to madmen having this custom, that ever when they
have drunken of a fair cup, cast it to the wall and break it. Thus
should not we do if we will well do. <span
id="an_lxiv-p6.1"></span><span id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span
id="an_lxiv-Page_259"></span> For we should not so feed us of the fruit,
that we should despise the tree; nor so drink, that we should break the
cup when we have drunken. The tree and the cup I call this visible
miracle, and all seemly bodily observances, that is according and not
letting the work of the spirit. The fruit and the drink I call the
ghostly bemeaning of these visible miracles, and of these seemly bodily
observances: as is lifting up of our eyes and our hands unto heaven. If
they be done by stirring of the spirit, then be they well done; and else
be they hypocrisy, and then be they false. If they be true and contain
in them ghostly fruit, why should they then be despised? For men will
kiss the cup for wine is therein.

<span id="an_lxiv-p7"></span>And what thereof, though our Lord when He
ascended to heaven bodily took His way upwards into the clouds, seen of
His mother and His disciples with their bodily eyes? Should we therefore
in our ghostly work ever stare <span id="an_lxiv-p7.1"></span><span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span id="an_lxiv-Page_260"></span> upwards
with our bodily eyes, to look after Him if we may see Him sit bodily in
heaven, or else stand, as Saint Stephen did? Nay, surely He shewed Him
not unto Saint Stephen bodily in heaven, because that He would give us
ensample that we should in our ghostly work look bodily up into heaven
if we might see Him as Saint Stephen did, either standing, or sitting,
or else lying. For howso His body is in heaven—standing, sitting, or
lying—wots no man. And it needeth not more to be witted, but that His
body is oned with the soul, without departing. The body and the soul,
the which is the manhood, is oned with the Godhead without departing
also. Of His sitting, His standing, His lying, needeth it not to wit;
but that He is there as Him list, and hath Him in body as most seemly is
unto Him for to be. For if He shew Him lying, or standing, or sitting,
by revelation bodily to any creature in this life, it is done for some
ghostly bemeaning: and <span id="an_lxiv-p7.2"></span><span
id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span id="an_lxiv-Page_261"></span> not for
no manner of bodily bearing that He hath in heaven. See by ensample. By
standing is understood a readiness of helping. And therefore it is said
commonly of one friend to another, when he is in bodily battle: “Bear
thee well, fellow, and fight fast, and give not up the battle over
lightly; for I shall stand by thee.” He meaneth not only bodily
standing; for peradventure this battle is on horse and not on foot, and
peradventure it is in going and not standing. But he meaneth when he
saith that he shall stand by him, that he shall be ready to help him.
For this reason it was that our Lord shewed Him bodily in heaven to
Saint Stephen, when he was in his martyrdom: and not to give us ensample
to look up to heaven. As He had said thus to Saint Stephen in person of
all those that suffer persecution for His love: “Lo, Stephen! as verily
as I open this bodily firmament, the which is called heaven, and let
thee see My bodily standing, trust fast that as verily stand I beside
<span id="an_lxiv-p7.3"></span><span id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span
id="an_lxiv-Page_262"></span> thee ghostly by the might of My Godhead.
And I am ready to help thee, and therefore stand thou stiffly in the
faith and suffer boldly the fell buffets of those hard stones: for I
shall crown thee in bliss for thy meed, and not only thee, but all those
that suffer persecution for Me on any manner.” And thus mayest thou see
that these bodily shewings were done by ghostly bemeanings. <span

[Next: Chapter 59: That a man shall not take ensample at the bodily
ascension of Christ, for to strain his imagination upwards bodily in the
time of prayer: and that time, place, and body, these three should be
forgotten in all ghostly working](cou64.md)
