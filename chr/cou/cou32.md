### <span id="an_xxxiii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SEVEN AND TWENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxxiii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxxiii-p3"></span>Who should work in the gracious work of
this book.

<span id="an_xxxiii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxxiii-p5"></span>FIRST and foremost, I will tell thee who
should work in this work, and when, and by what means: and what
discretion thou shalt have in it. If thou asketh me who shall work thus,
I answer thee—all that have forsaken the world in a true will, and
thereto that give them not to active life, but to that life that is
called contemplative life. All those should work in this grace and in
this work, whatsoever that they be; whether they have been accustomed
sinners or none. <span id="an_xxxiii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_167">p.

before the time that he be lawfully cleansed in conscience of all his
special deeds of sin](cou33)
