### <span id="an_xxxiv-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE EIGHT AND TWENTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xxxiv-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xxxiv-p3"></span>That a man should not presume to work in
this work before the time that he be lawfully cleansed in conscience of
all his special deeds of sin.

<span id="an_xxxiv-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xxxiv-p5"></span>BUT if thou asketh me when they should
work in this work, then I answer thee and I say: that not ere they have
cleansed their conscience of all their special deeds of sin done before,
after the common ordinance of Holy Church.

<span id="an_xxxiv-p6"></span>For in this work, a soul drieth up in it
all the root and the ground of sin that will always live in it after
confession, be it never so busy. And, therefore, whoso will travail in
this work, let him first cleanse his conscience; and afterward when he
hath done that in him is lawfully, let him dispose him <span
id="an_xxxiv-p6.1"></span><span id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span
id="an_xxxiv-Page_168"></span> boldly but meekly thereto. And let him
think, that he hath full long been holden therefrom. For this is that
work in the which a soul should travail all his lifetime, though he had
never sinned deadly. And the whiles that a soul is dwelling in this
deadly flesh, it shall evermore see and feel this cumbrous cloud of
unknowing betwixt him and God. And not only that, but in pain of the
original sin it shall evermore see and feel that some of all the
creatures that ever God made, or some of their works, will evermore
press in remembrance betwixt it and God. And this is the right wisdom of
God, that man, when he had sovereignty and lordship of all other
creatures, because that he wilfully made him underling to the stirring
of his subjects, leaving the bidding of God and his Maker; that right so
after, when he would fulfil the bidding of God, he saw and felt all the
creatures that should be beneath him, proudly press above him, betwixt
him and his God. <span id="an_xxxiv-p6.2"></span><span id="page_169">p.

suffer the pain thereof, and judge no man](cou34)
