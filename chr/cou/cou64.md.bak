### <span id="an_lxv-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE NINE AND FIFTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lxv-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lxv-p3"></span>That a man shall not take ensample at the
bodily ascension of Christ, for to strain his imagination upwards bodily
in the time of prayer: and that time, place, and body, these three
should be forgotten in all ghostly working.

<span id="an_lxv-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lxv-p5"></span>AND if thou say aught touching the ascension
of our Lord, for that was done bodily, and for a bodily bemeaning as
well as for a ghostly, for both He ascended very God and very man: to
this will I answer thee, that He had been dead, and was clad with
undeadliness, and so shall we be at the Day of Doom. And then we shall
be made so subtle in body and in soul together, that we shall be then as
swiftly where us list bodily as we be <span
id="an_lxv-p5.1"></span><span id="page_264">p. 264</span> <span
id="an_lxv-Page_264"></span> now in our thought ghostly; whether it be
up or down, on one side or on other, behind or before, all I hope shall
then be alike good, as clerks say. But now thou mayest not come to
heaven bodily, but ghostly. And yet it shall be so ghostly, that it
shall not be on bodily manner; neither upwards nor downwards, nor on one
side nor on other, behind nor before.

<span id="an_lxv-p6"></span>And wit well that all those that set them to
be ghostly workers, and specially in the work of this book, that
although they read “lift up” or “go in,” although all that the work of
this book be called a stirring, nevertheless yet them behoveth to have a
full busy beholding, that this stirring stretch neither up bodily, nor
in bodily, nor yet that it be any such stirring as is from one place to
another. And although that it be sometime called a rest, nevertheless
yet they shall not think that it is any such rest as is any abiding in a
place without removing therefrom. For the <span
id="an_lxv-p6.1"></span><span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="an_lxv-Page_265"></span> perfection of this work is so pure and so
ghostly in itself, that an it be well and truly conceived, it shall be
seen far removed from any stirring and from any place.

<span id="an_lxv-p7"></span>And it should by some reason rather be
called a sudden changing, than any stirring of place. For time, place,
and body: these three should be forgotten in all ghostly working. And
therefore be wary in this work, that thou take none ensample at the
bodily ascension of Christ for to strain thine imagination in the time
of thy prayer bodily upwards, as thou wouldest climb above the moon. For
it should on nowise be so, ghostly. But if thou shouldest ascend into
heaven bodily, as Christ did, then thou mightest take ensample at it:
but that may none do but God, as Himself witnesseth, saying: “There is
no man that may ascend unto heaven but only He that descended from
heaven, and became man for the love of man.” And if it were possible, as
it on nowise may <span id="an_lxv-p7.1"></span><span id="page_266">p.
266</span> <span id="an_lxv-Page_266"></span> be, yet it should be for
abundance of ghostly working only by the might of the spirit, full far
from any bodily stressing or straining of our imagination bodily, either
up, or in, on one side, or on other. And therefore let be such
falsehood: it should not be so. <span id="an_lxv-p7.2"></span><span
