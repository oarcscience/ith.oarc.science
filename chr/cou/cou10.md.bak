### <span id="an_xi-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE FIFTH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xi-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xi-p3"></span>That in the time of this word all the
creatures that ever have been, be now, or ever shall be, and all the
works of those same creatures, should be hid under the cloud of
forgetting.

<span id="an_xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="an_xi-p5"></span>AND if ever thou shalt come to this cloud and
dwell and work therein as I bid thee, thee behoveth as this cloud of
unknowing is above thee, betwixt thee and thy God, right so put a cloud
of forgetting beneath thee; betwixt thee and all the creatures that ever
be made. Thee thinketh, peradventure, that thou art full far from God
because that this cloud of unknowing is betwixt thee and thy God: but
surely, an it be well conceived, thou art well further from Him when
thou hast no cloud of forgetting betwixt thee and all the <span
id="an_xi-p5.1"></span><span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="an_xi-Page_86"></span> creatures that ever be made. As oft as I say,
all the creatures that ever be made, as oft I mean not only the
creatures themselves, but also all the works and the conditions of the
same creatures. I take out not one creature, whether they be bodily
creatures or ghostly, nor yet any condition or work of any creature,
whether they be good or evil: but shortly to say, all should be hid
under the cloud of forgetting in this case.

<span id="an_xi-p6"></span>For although it be full profitable sometime
to think of certain conditions and deeds of some certain special
creatures, nevertheless yet in this work it profiteth little or nought.
For why? Memory or thinking of any creature that ever God made, or of
any of their deeds either, it is a manner of ghostly light: for the eye
of thy soul is opened on it and even fixed thereupon, as the eye of a
shooter is upon the prick that he shooteth to. And one thing I tell
thee, that all thing that thou thinketh <span
id="an_xi-p6.1"></span><span id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span
id="an_xi-Page_87"></span> upon, it is above thee for the time, and
betwixt thee and thy God: and insomuch thou art the further from God,
that aught is in thy mind but only God.

<span id="an_xi-p7"></span>Yea! and, if it be courteous and seemly to
say, in this work it profiteth little or nought to think of the kindness
or the worthiness of God, nor on our Lady, nor on the saints or angels
in heaven, nor yet on the joys in heaven: that is to say, with a special
beholding to them, as thou wouldest by that beholding feed and increase
thy purpose. I trow that on nowise it should help in this case and in
this work. For although it be good to think upon the kindness of God,
and to love Him and praise Him for it, yet it is far better to think
upon the naked being of Him, and to love Him and praise Him for Himself.
