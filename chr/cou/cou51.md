### <span id="an_lii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SIX AND FORTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_lii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_lii-p3"></span>A good teaching how a man shall flee these
deceits, and work more with a listiness of spirit, than with any
boisterousness of body

<span id="an_lii-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_lii-p5"></span>AND therefore for God’s love be wary in this
work, and strain not thine heart in thy breast over‑rudely nor out of
measure; but work more with a list than with any worthless strength. For
ever the more Mistily, the more meekly and ghostly: and ever the more
rudely, the more bodily and beastly. And therefore be wary, for surely
what beastly heart that presumeth for to touch the high mount of this
work, it shall be beaten away with stones. Stones be hard and dry in
their kind, and they hurt full sore where they hit. And surely such rude
<span id="an_lii-p5.1"></span><span id="page_219">p. 219</span> <span
id="an_lii-Page_219"></span> strainings be full hard fastened in
fleshliness of bodily feeling, and full dry from any witting of grace;
and they hurt full sore the silly soul, and make it fester in fantasy
feigned of fiends. And therefore be wary with this beastly rudeness, and
learn thee to love listily, with a soft and a demure behaviour as well
in body as in soul; and abide courteously and meekly the will of our
Lord, and snatch not overhastily, as it were a greedy greyhound, hunger
thee never so sore. And, gamingly be it said, I counsel that thou do
that in thee is, refraining the rude and the great stirring of thy
spirit, right as thou on nowise wouldest let Him wit how fain thou
wouldest see Him, and have Him or feel Him.

<span id="an_lii-p6"></span>This is childishly and playingly spoken,
thee think peradventure. But I trow whoso had grace to do and feel as I
say, he should feel good gamesome play with Him, as the father doth with
the child, kissing and clipping, that well were him so. <span

[Next: Chapter 47: A slight teaching of this work in purity of spirit;
declaring how that on one manner a soul should shew his desire unto God,
and on ye contrary, unto man](cou52)
