### <span id="an_xli-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE FIVE AND THIRTIETH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xli-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xli-p3"></span>Of three means in the which a contemplative
Prentice should be occupied, in reading, thinking, and praying.

<span id="an_xli-p4"></span>* *

<span id="an_xli-p5"></span>NEVERTHELESS, means there be in the which a
contemplative prentice should be occupied, the which be these—Lesson,
Meditation, and Orison: or else to thine understanding they may be
called—Reading, Thinking, and Praying. Of these three thou shalt find
written in another book of another man’s work, much better than I can
tell thee; and therefore it needeth not here to tell thee of the
qualities of them. But this may I tell thee: these three be so coupled
together, that unto them that be beginners and profiters—but not to them
that be <span id="an_xli-p5.1"></span><span id="page_186">p. 186</span>
<span id="an_xli-Page_186"></span> perfect, yea, as it may be
here—thinking may not goodly be gotten, without reading or hearing
coming before. All is one in manner, reading and hearing: clerks reading
on books, and lewd men reading on clerks when they hear them preach the
word of God. Nor prayer may not goodly be gotten in beginners and
profiters, without thinking coming before.

<span id="an_xli-p6"></span>See by the proof. In this same course, God’s
word either written or spoken is likened to a mirror. Ghostly, the eyes
of thy soul is thy reason; thy conscience is thy visage ghostly. And
right as thou seest that if a foul spot be in thy bodily visage, the
eyes of the same visage may not see that spot nor wit where it is,
without a mirror or a teaching of another than itself; right so it is
ghostly, without reading or hearing of God’s word it is impossible to
man’s understanding that a soul that is blinded in custom of sin should
see the foul spot in his conscience. <span id="an_xli-p6.1"></span><span
id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span id="an_xli-Page_187"></span>

<span id="an_xli-p7"></span>And so following, when a man seeth in a
bodily or ghostly mirror, or wots by other men’s teaching, whereabouts
the foul spot is on his visage, either bodily or ghostly; then at first,
and not before, he runneth to the well to wash him. If this spot be any
special sin, then is this well Holy Church, and this water confession,
with the circumstances. If it be but a blind root and a stirring of sin,
then is this well merciful God, and this water prayer, with the
circumstances. And thus mayest thou see that no thinking may goodly be
gotten in beginners and profiters, without reading or hearing coming
before: nor praying without thinking. <span
