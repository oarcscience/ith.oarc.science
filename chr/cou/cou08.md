### <span id="an_ix-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE THIRD CHAPTER

<span id="an_ix-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_ix-p3"></span>How the work of this book shall be wrought,
and of the worthiness of it before all other works.

<span id="an_ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="an_ix-p5"></span>LIFT up thine heart unto God with a meek
stirring of love; and mean Himself, and none of His goods. And thereto,
look the loath to think on aught but Himself. So that nought work in thy
wit, nor in thy will, but only Himself. And do that in thee is to forget
all the creatures that ever God made and the works of them; so that thy
thought nor thy desire be not directed nor stretched to any of them,
neither in general nor in special, but let them be, and take no heed to
them. This is the work of the soul that most pleaseth God. All saints
and angels have joy of this work, and hasten them <span
id="an_ix-p5.1"></span><span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="an_ix-Page_72"></span> to help it in all their might. All fiends be
furious when thou thus dost, and try for to defeat it in all that they
can. All men living in earth be wonderfully holpen of this work, thou
wottest not how. Yea, the souls in purgatory be eased of their pain by
virtue of this work. Thyself art cleansed and made virtuous by no work
so much. And yet it is the lightest work of all, when a soul is helped
with grace in sensible list, and soonest done. But else it is hard, and
wonderful to thee for to do.

<span id="an_ix-p6"></span>Let not, therefore, but travail therein till
thou feel list. For at the first time when thou dost it, thou findest
but a darkness; and as it were a cloud of unknowing, thou knowest not
what, saving that thou feelest in thy will a naked intent unto God. This
darkness and this cloud is, howsoever thou dost, betwixt thee and thy
God, and letteth thee that thou mayest neither see Him clearly by light
of understanding in thy reason, nor feel Him in sweetness of love in
thine affection. <span id="an_ix-p6.1"></span><span id="page_73">p.
73</span> <span id="an_ix-Page_73"></span>

<span id="an_ix-p7"></span>And therefore shape thee to bide in this
darkness as long as thou mayest, evermore crying after Him that thou
lovest. For if ever thou shalt feel Him or see Him, as it may be here,
it behoveth always to be in this cloud in this darkness. And if thou
wilt busily travail as I bid thee, I trust in His mercy that thou shalt
come thereto. <span id="an_ix-p7.1"></span><span id="page_74">p.
74</span> <span id="an_ix-Page_74"></span>

come to by the curiosity of wit, nor by imagination](cou09)
