### <span id="an_xiii-p1.1"></span>HERE BEGINNETH THE SEVENTH CHAPTER

<span id="an_xiii-p2"></span> 

<span id="an_xiii-p3"></span>How a man shall have him in this work
against all thoughts, and specially against all those that arise of his
own curiosity, of cunning, and of natural wit.

<span id="an_xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="an_xiii-p5"></span>AND if any thought rise and will press
continually above thee betwixt thee and that darkness, and ask thee
saying, “What seekest thou, and what wouldest thou have?” say thou, that
it is God that thou wouldest have. “Him I covet, Him I seek, and nought
but Him.”

<span id="an_xiii-p6"></span>And if he ask thee, “What is that God?” say
thou, that it is God that made thee and bought thee, and that graciously
hath called thee to thy degree. “And in Him,” say, “thou hast no skill.”
And therefore say, “Go thou down again,” and tread him <span
id="an_xiii-p6.1"></span><span id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span
id="an_xiii-Page_91"></span> fast down with a stirring of love, although
he seem to thee right holy, and seem to thee as he would help thee to
seek Him. For peradventure he will bring to thy mind diverse full fair
and wonderful points of His kindness, and say that He is full sweet, and
full loving, full gracious, and full merciful. And if thou wilt hear
him, he coveteth no better; for at the last he will thus jangle ever
more and more till he bring thee lower, to the mind of His Passion.

<span id="an_xiii-p7"></span>And there will he let thee see the
wonderful kindness of God, and if thou hear him, he careth for nought
better. For soon after he will let thee see thine old wretched living,
and peradventure in seeing and thinking thereof he will bring to thy
mind some place that thou hast dwelt in before this time. So that at the
last, or ever thou wit, thou shalt be scattered thou wottest not where.
The cause of this scattering is, that thou heardest him first wilfully,
then answeredest <span id="an_xiii-p7.1"></span><span id="page_92">p.
92</span> <span id="an_xiii-Page_92"></span> him, receivedest him, and
lettest him alone.

<span id="an_xiii-p8"></span>And yet, nevertheless, the thing that he
said was both good and holy. Yea, and so holy, that what man or woman
that weeneth to come to contemplation without many such sweet
meditations of their own wretchedness, the passion, the kindness, and
the great goodness, and the worthiness of God coming before, surely he
shall err and fail of his purpose. And yet, nevertheless, it behoveth a
man or a woman that hath long time been used in these meditations,
nevertheless to leave them, and put them and hold them far down under
the cloud of forgetting, if ever he shall pierce the cloud of unknowing
betwixt him and his God. Therefore what time that thou purposest thee to
this work, and feelest by grace that thou art called of God, lift then
up thine heart unto God with a meek stirring of love; and mean God that
made thee, and bought thee, and that graciously hath called thee to thy
<span id="an_xiii-p8.1"></span><span id="page_93">p. 93</span> <span
id="an_xiii-Page_93"></span> degree, and receive none other thought of
God. And yet not all these, but if thou list; for it sufficeth enough, a
naked intent direct unto God without any other cause than Himself.

<span id="an_xiii-p9"></span>And if thee list have this intent lapped
and folden in one word, for thou shouldest have better hold thereupon,
take thee but a little word of one syllable: for so it is better than of
two, for ever the shorter it is the better it accordeth with the work of
the Spirit. And such a word is this word GOD or this word LOVE. Choose
thee whether thou wilt, or another; as thee list, which that thee liketh
best of one syllable. And fasten this word to thine heart, so that it
never go thence for thing that befalleth.

<span id="an_xiii-p10"></span>This word shall be thy shield and thy
spear, whether thou ridest on peace or on war. With this word, thou
shalt beat on this cloud and this darkness above thee. With this word,
thou shall smite down all manner of <span
id="an_xiii-p10.1"></span><span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="an_xiii-Page_94"></span> thought under the cloud of forgetting.
Insomuch, that if any thought press upon thee to ask thee what thou
wouldest have, answer them with no more words but with this one word.
And if he proffer thee of his great clergy to expound thee that word and
to tell thee the conditions of that word, say him: That thou wilt have
it all whole, and not broken nor undone. And if thou wilt hold thee fast
on this purpose, be thou sure, he will no while abide. And why? For that
thou wilt not let him feed him on such sweet meditations of God touched
before. <span id="an_xiii-p10.2"></span><span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

ever have been, be now, or ever shall be, and all the works of those
creatures, should be hid under the cloud of forgetting](cou13.md)
