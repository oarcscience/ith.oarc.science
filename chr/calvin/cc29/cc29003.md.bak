<span id="iii.i-p1"></span>Calvin’s Preface to Habakkuk

<span id="iii.i-p2"></span>Now follows The Prophet Habakkuk;  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) but the time in which he discharged his
office of a Teacher is not quite certain. The Hebrews, according to
their usual manner, unhesitatingly assert that he prophesied under the
king Manasseh; but this conjecture is not well founded. We are however
led to think that this prophecy was announced when the contumacy of the
people had become irreclaimable. It is indeed probable, from the
complaint which we shall have presently to notice, that the people had
previously given many proofs of irremediable wickedness. To me it
appears evident that the Prophet was sent, when others had in vain
endeavored to correct the wickedness of the people. But as he denounces
an approaching judgement on the Chaldeans, he seems to have prophesied
either under Manasseh or under the other kings before the time of
Zedechiah; but we cannot fix the exact time.  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md)

<span id="iii.i-p7"></span>The substance of the Book may be thus stated:
— In the First chapter he complains of the rebellious obstinacy of the
people, and deplores the corruptions which then prevailed; he then
appears as the herald of God, and warns the Jews of their approaching
ruin; he afterwards applies consolation, as God would punish the
Chaldeans when their pride became intolerable. In the second chapter he
exhorts the godly to patience by his own example, and speaks at large of
the near ruin of Babylon; and in the third chapter, as we shall see, he
turns to supplication and prayer.

<span id="iii.i-p8"></span>We shall now come to the words.

<span id="iii.i-p3"></span> Who Habakkuk was is uncertain. Some have
concluded, from chapter 3:19, that he was of the tribe of Levi; but the
premises do not warrant the conclusion. “He was probably,” says *Adam
Clarke*, “of the tribe of *Simeon*, and a native of Beth-zacar.” The
grounds for this probability are not stated. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_6"></span>[7](cc29003.htm#fr_6.md) <span
id="iii.i-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p4"></span> *Newcome’s* opinion is the following: — “It
seems probable that Habakkuk lived after the taking of Nineveh, as he
prophesies of the Chaldeans, and is silent on the subject of the
Assyrians. We have also reason to conclude that he prophesied not long
before the Jewish captivity. See chapter 1:5; 2:3; 3:2,6-19. He may
therefore be placed in the reign of Jehoiakim, between the years 606 and
598 before Christ.”

<span id="iii.i-p5"></span>*Henderson* agrees with this view.

<span id="iii.i-p6"></span>“<span id="iii.i-p6.1"></span>Hunc librum
canonicum esse constat,” — tum 1. quia in Bibliis Hebrais extat; tum 2.
quia in N.T. allegatum, <span id="iii.i-p6.2"></span>[Ac
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041.md)<span id="iii.i-p6.2"></span>;
<span id="iii.i-p6.3"></span>[Ro

<span id="iii.i-p6.4"></span>[Ga
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md)<span id="iii.i-p6.4"></span>;
<span id="iii.i-p6.5"></span>[Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md)<span id="iii.i-p6.5"></span>. It
appears that this book is canonical, 1., because it is extant in Hebrew;
2., because it is quoted in the New Testament,” etc. — *Tarnovius.*
