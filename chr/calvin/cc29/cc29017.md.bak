<span id="vi.i-p1"></span>A TRANSLATION of

<span id="vi.i-p2"></span>CALVIN’S VERSION of

<span id="vi.i-p3"></span>THE BOOK OF HABAKKUK.

<span id="vi.i.i"></span>

<span id="vi.i.i-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.i-p2"></span><span id="vi.i.i-p2.1"></span>chapter 1

<span id="vi.i.i-p3"></span>**1** the burden which Habakkuk the Prophet
saw:

<span id="vi.i.i-p4"></span>**2** How long, Jehovah, shall I cry, And
thou wilt not hear? *And* cry aloud to thee of violence, And thou wilt
not save?

<span id="vi.i.i-p5"></span>**3** Why showest thou me iniquity, And
makest me to see trouble? And *why* are violence and plunder in my
sight, And he who excites strife and contention? (**19**)

<span id="vi.i.i-p6"></span>**4** Therefore dissolved is the law, And
judgment does not continually go forth; For the wicked surrounds the
just, Therefor go forth does perverted judgment. (**21**)

<span id="vi.i.i-p7"></span>**5** Look ye among the Gentiles and see,
And be astonished, be astonished; For a work will I work in your days,
Which ye will not believe, though it be told you:

<span id="vi.i.i-p8"></span>**6** For behold, I will rouse the Chaldeans
— A nation bitter and hasty, Which shall march through the breadths of
the earth, To possess habitations not its own:

<span id="vi.i.i-p9"></span>**7** Terrible and fearful *shall it* be,
From itself shall its judgment and its dignity proceed:

<span id="vi.i.i-p10"></span>**8** And swifter than leopards *shall be*
its horses, And fiercer than the evening wolves; And numerous shall be
its horsemen; And its horsemen from far shall come, They shall fly as an
eagle hastening to devour: (**30**)

<span id="vi.i.i-p11"></span>**9** The whole *of it* for booty shall
come; The aspect of their faces will be like the east-wind; And he will
gather captives like the sand:

<span id="vi.i.i-p12"></span>**10** And at kings he will laugh, And
princes *shall be* a scorn to him: Every fortress he will scorn, He will
gather dust and take it:

<span id="vi.i.i-p13"></span>**11** Then will be change his spirit, And
pass through and act impiously, *Ascribing* this his power to his god.
(**37**)

<span id="vi.i.i-p14"></span>**12** Art not thou, Jehovah, from the
beginning, my God? My holy One! we shall not die: Thou, Jehovah, for
judgment hast set him; And thou strong One, for correction hast
established him.

<span id="vi.i.i-p15"></span>**13** Pure art thou of eyes, so as not to
behold evil, And on trouble thou canst not look: — Why lookest thou on
transgressors, And takest no notice, when the ungodly devours One more
righteous than himself?

<span id="vi.i.i-p16"></span>**14** Thou makest man like the fish of the
sea, Like the reptile, which is without a leader: (**46**)

<span id="vi.i.i-p17"></span>**15** The whole by his hook will he draw
up, Collect into his drag, and gather into his net; He will therefore
rejoice and exult: (**48**)

<span id="vi.i.i-p18"></span>**16** Hence sacrifice will he to his drag,
And incense will he offer to his net; For through them fat *will be* his
portion, And his meat *will be* rich. —

<span id="vi.i.i-p19"></span>**17** Shall he therefore extend his drag,
And continue to slay the nations, so as not to spare *them*?

<span id="vi.i.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.i.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="vi.i.ii-p3"></span>**1** On my watch-tower will I stand, And
set myself on a citadel; And I will watch to see what he may say to me,
And what I may answer to the reproof given me.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p4"></span>**2** Then answer me did Jehovah and said,
Write the vision, and make it plain on tables, That run may he who reads
it;

<span id="vi.i.ii-p5"></span>**3** For yet the vision shall be for an
appointed time, And will speak at the end, and will not deceive: If it
tarry, wait for it; (**66**) for coming it will come, and will not
delay.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p6"></span>**4** Behold the elated! not right is his
soul within him; But the just, by his faith, shall he live.” (**72**)

<span id="vi.i.ii-p7"></span>**5** Yea, truly! as by wine, transgress
does the proud man, And he will not rest; (**87**) For he enlarges as
the grave his soul, And is like to death, and is not satisfied; Yea, he
collects to himself all nations, And heaps together for himself all the
people.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p8"></span>**6** Shall not all these take up against
him a parable, And against him an enigmatical taunt, and say, — “Ho! he
multiplies what is not his own! how long! And he accumulates on himself
thick clay!

<span id="vi.i.ii-p9"></span>**7** Shall they not suddenly rise up who
shall bite thee, And awake, who shall torment thee? And shalt not thou
become tramplings to them?

<span id="vi.i.ii-p10"></span>**8** As thou has spoiled many nations,
Spoil thee shall all the remnant of the people, On account of men’s
blood, and of violence To the land, to the city and to all its
inhabitants.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p11"></span>**9** Ho! he covets an evil covetousness
to his house, In order to set on high his nest, That he may keep himself
from the hand of evil!

<span id="vi.i.ii-p12"></span>**10** Thou hast provided shame for thine
own house, By cutting off many nations, And thou hast sinned against
thine own soul.”

<span id="vi.i.ii-p13"></span>**11** For the stone from the wall shall
cry,  <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) And the wood from the
chamber shall answer it, —

<span id="vi.i.ii-p31"></span>**12** “Ho! he builds a town by blood, And
sets up a city by iniquity!”

<span id="vi.i.ii-p32"></span>**13** Behold, shall nothing be from
Jehovah of hosts? Hence labour shall the people in the fire, And weary
themselves in vain;

<span id="vi.i.ii-p33"></span>**14** For filled shall be earth with the
knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, As the waters cover the sea.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p34"></span>**15** Wo to him who gives his friend
drink! — Uniting thy heat, thou makes them also to drink, That thou
mayest look on their nakedness. (**112**)

<span id="vi.i.ii-p35"></span>**16** Thou art filled with shame for the
sake of glory; Drink thou also, and be thou uncovered: Poured forth to
thee shall be the cup of Jehovah’s right hand, And shameful spewing
shall be on thy glory:

<span id="vi.i.ii-p36"></span>**17** For overwhelm thee shall the
violence done to Lebanon, And the spoiling of beasts, which terrified
them; On account of men’s blood, and of violence To the land, to the
city, and to all its inhabitants.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p37"></span>**18** What avails the graven image? For
graven it hath its framer, *Even* the molten image and the teacher of
falsehood; For trust does the framer in his own work, when he makes dumb
idols. (**122**)

<span id="vi.i.ii-p38"></span>**19** Wo to him who saith to wood,
“Awake;” *And* “Arise,” to a dumb stone; — it will teach: Behold, it is
covered with gold and silver; And *there is* no spirit in the midst of
it. (**124**) But Jehovah is in his holy Temple: Silent at his presence
let the whole earth be.

<span id="vi.i.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.i.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3.

<span id="vi.i.iii-p3"></span>**1** The prayer of Habakkuk the Prophet
respecting ignorances:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p4"></span>**2** Jehovah! I heard thy voice, and was
terrified; Jehovah! thy work in the midst of the years, revive it; In
the midst of the years, make it know; In wrath thy mercy remember.
(**137**)

<span id="vi.i.iii-p5"></span>**3** God! from Teman he came; And the
holy One from mount Paran: Selah: Cover the heaven did his glory; Of his
praise full was the earth:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p6"></span>**4** And brightness, — as the light it
was; Horns, — from his hands they were; (**143**) And there was the
hiding of his strength:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p7"></span>**5** Before his face walked the
pestilence, And come forth did burning coals at his feet:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p8"></span>**6** He stood, and he measured the earth;
He looked, and he dissolved nations; Yea, shattered were perennial
mountains, Bent down were hills of antiquity; The ways of ages were his.

<span id="vi.i.iii-p9"></span>**7** For iniquity saw I the tents of
Chusan; (**150**) Tremble did the curtains of the land of Madian.

<span id="vi.i.iii-p10"></span>**8** Wert thou angry with rivers, O
Jehovah? Was thine indignation against rivers? Was thy wrath against the
sea? For thou didst ride on thy horses, Thy chariots *were* salvation.

<span id="vi.i.iii-p11"></span>**9** Quite bare was made thy bow: The
oaths to the tribes *was thy* word: Selah: (155) With rivers didst thou
cleave the earth.

<span id="vi.i.iii-p12"></span>**10** See thee did mountains, they fell
down; The stream of waters passed away; Utter its voice did the deep, On
high did it raise its hands. (**158**)

<span id="vi.i.iii-p13"></span>**11** The sun *and* moon stood still *in
their* habitation; At the light of thy arrows did they proceed, At the
brightness of the glittering of thy spear. (**160**)

<span id="vi.i.iii-p14"></span>**12** In wrath didst thou tread on the
land, In anger didst thou thresh the nations:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p15"></span>**13** Go forth didst thou for the
salvation of thy people, For *their* salvation, with thy Christ: Strike
didst thou the head From the house of the wicked, Making bare the
foundation even to the neck: (**164**)

<span id="vi.i.iii-p16"></span>**14** Smite didst thou with his own
staffs The head of his villages: They rushed as a whirlwind to drive me
away; Their joy was to devour the poor in secret:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p17"></span>**15** A way hast thou made in the sea
for thy horses, *Through* the heap of great waters. (**168**)

<span id="vi.i.iii-p18"></span>**16** I heard, — and tremble did my
bowels, At *thy* voice quiver did my lips; Enter did rottenness into my
bones, And within me I made a great noise; That I might rest in the day
of affliction, When he ascends against the people, Who shall cut them
off. (**171**)

<span id="vi.i.iii-p19"></span>**17** For the fig-tree shall not
flourish, And no fruit shall be on the vines, Fail shall the produce of
the olive, And the fields shall not bring forth food; cut off from the
fold shall be the flock, And there shall be no ox in the stalls:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p20"></span>**18** But I — in Jehovah will I exult, I
will rejoice in the God of my salvation:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p21"></span>**19** Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength;
And he will set my feet as those of hinds, And on my high places will he
make me to walk — To the leader on my beatings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_153"></span>[154](cc29017.htm#fr_153.md) <span
id="vi.i.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.ii-p14"></span> *Calvin* makes here a change in the
discourse; but the whole to the end of the chapter may be viewed as the
parable or the taunt mentioned in verse 6, and the particle Ho! may be
retained instead of Wo. The taunt seems to have been formed so as to
have been especially suitable to be used by the Jews.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p15"></span>By regarding the passage in this light, we
can understand the sudden change off person in verse 16, if the proposed
emendation be disapproved; for we see the same in the former portions of
the “taunt.” See 6 and 7, and also 9 and 10. That the reader may see the
whole of this passage, containing the “taunt,” in the light in which I
am now fully inclined to regard it, it shall be presented to him
complete: —

<span id="vi.i.ii-p16"></span>**6.** Will not these, every one of them,
Raise up a proverb concerning him, And a taunt, enigmas for him, and
say, — “Ho! He increases what is not his! how long! And he accumulates
on himself thick clay! —

<span id="vi.i.ii-p17"></span>**7.** Will they not suddenly rise up —
thy biters, And awake — thy tormentors, And thou become booties to them?

<span id="vi.i.ii-p18"></span>**8.** For thou hast spoiled many nation,
And spoil thee shall all the remnant of the people, On account of men’s
blood, and of violence To the land, to the city, and to all its
inhabitants.”

<span id="vi.i.ii-p19"></span>**9.** “Ho! he has coveted an evil
covetousness to his house, To set on high his nest, In order to save
himself from the hand of evil! —

<span id="vi.i.ii-p20"></span>**10.** Thou hast consulted shame to thine
house, By cutting off many nations And by sinning against thine own
soul:

<span id="vi.i.ii-p21"></span>**11.** For the stone — from the wall it
cries, And the beam — from the woodwork it answers it, —

<span id="vi.i.ii-p22"></span>**12.** ‘Ho! he builds a town by blood,
And sets up a city by oppression!’ —

<span id="vi.i.ii-p23"></span>**13.** Shall nothing *be*, lo! From
Jehovah of hosts? Yea, labor shall the people for the fire, And nations
— for vanity shall they weary themselves:

<span id="vi.i.ii-p24"></span>**14.** For filled shall be the earth With
the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, Like the waters which spread over
the sea.”

<span id="vi.i.ii-p25"></span>**15.** “Ho! he gives drink to his
neighbour! — Thou addest thy bottle and also strong drink, In order to
look on their nakedness!

<span id="vi.i.ii-p26"></span>**16.** Thou hast been filled with
reproach rather than with glory: Drink thou also, and be uncovered; Come
round to thee shall the cup Of the right hand of Jehovah; And shameful
spewing shall be on thy glory:

<span id="vi.i.ii-p27"></span>**17.** For the violence done to Lebanon —
it shall overwhelm thee, And the plunder of beasts — it shall rend thee;
On account of men’s blood, and of violence To the land, to the city, and
to all its inhabitants.”

<span id="vi.i.ii-p28"></span>**18.** “What avails the graven image! For
its graver — he forms it — Even the molten image and the teacher of
falsehood: Yea, trust in it does the former of its form, After having
made dumb idols!

<span id="vi.i.ii-p29"></span>**19.** Ho! he saith to the wood, ‘Arise,
Awake;’ To the dumb stone, ‘It will teach?’ Behold it! covered it is
with gold and silver, Yet there is no spirit within it! But Jehovah is
in his holy temple: Silent at his presence let the whole earth be.”

<span id="vi.i.ii-p30"></span>The “taunt” *may* be deemed as terminating
at the end of the 17th verse; but I regard it as continuing to the end
of the chapter. The word “neighbour,” in the 15th verse, is a collective
singular, meaning every neighbour: hence “their” at the end of the
verse. The same may be said of “image” in verse 18, which means every
image or images, as “idols” are mentioned afterwards. Such are common
instances in the Prophets. “It will teach,” in verse 19, most evidently
refers to “the dumb stone” — the idol; for it is expressly called “the
teacher of falsehood” in verse 17. — *Ed*
