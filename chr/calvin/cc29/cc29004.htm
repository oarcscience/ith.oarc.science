<p><a name="iii.ii.ii-p5"></A>The greater part of interpreters refer this burden to the Chaldeans and the monarchy of Babylon; but of this view I do not approve, and a good reason compels me to dissent from their opinion: for as the Prophet addresses the Jews, and without any addition calls his prophecy a burden, there is no doubt but that he refers to them. Besides, their view seems wholly inconsistent, because the Prophet dreads the future devastation of the land, 				and complains to God for allowing His chosen and elect people to be so cruelly treated. What others think is more correct &#8212; that this burden belonged to the Jews.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.ii-p6"></A>What the Prophet understood by the word <a name="iii.ii.ii-p6.1"></A>&#1502;&#1513;&#1488;, <i>mesha</i>, has been elsewhere stated. Habakkuk then reproves here his own nation, and shows that they had in vain disdainfully resisted all God&#8217;s prophets, for they would at length find that their threatening would be 				accomplished. The burden, then, which the Prophet Habakkuk saw, was this &#8212; That God, after having exercised long forbearance towards the Jews, would at length be the punisher of their many sins. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.iii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.ii.iii-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002">Hab. 1:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#003">3</a><a name="iii.ii.iii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p6"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.ii.iii-p7"></A><a name="iii.ii.iii-p7.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p8"></A>As I have already reminded you, interpreters think that the Prophet speaks here of future things, as though he had in his view the calamity which he afterwards mentions; but this is too strained a meaning; I therefore doubt not but that the Prophet expostulates here with God for so patiently indulging a reprobate people. For though the Prophets felt a real concern for the safety of the people, there is yet no doubt but that they burned 				with zeal for the glory of God; and when they saw that they had to contend with refractory men, they were then inflamed with a holy displeasure, and undertook the cause of God; and they implored His aid to bring a remedy when the state of things had become desperate. I therefore consider that the Prophet here solicits God to visit these many sins in which the people had hardened themselves. And hence we conclude that he had previously exercised his office of a teacher; for it would have been 				otherwise improper for him to begin his work with such a complaint and expostulation. He had then by experience found that the people were extremely perverse. When he saw that there was no hope of amendment, and that the state of things was becoming daily worse, burning with zeal for God, he gave full vent to his feelings. Before, then, he threatens the people with the future vengeance of God, he withdraws himself, as it were, from intercourse with men, and in private addresses God himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p9"></A>We must bear this first in mind, that the Prophet relates here the secret colloquy he had with God: but it ought not to be ascribed to an unfeeling disposition, that in these words he wished to hasten God&#8217;s vengeance against his own kindred; for it behaved the Prophet not only to be solicitous for the salvation of the people, but also to feel a concern for the glory of God, yea, to burn with a holy zeal. As, then, he had in vain labored 				for a length of time, I doubt not but that, being as it were far removed from the presence of all witnesses, he here asks God, how long he purposed thus to bear with the wickedness of the people. We now apprehend the design of the Prophet and the import of his words.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p10"></A>But he says first, <i>How long, Jehovah, shall I cry, and thou hearest not? How long shall I cry to thee for violence, that is, on account of violence, and thou savest not?</i> We hence learn, that the Prophet had often prayed God to correct the people for their wickedness, or to contrive some means to prevent so much licentiousness in sinning. It is indeed probable that the 				Prophet had prayed as long as there was any hope; but when he saw that things were past recovery, he then prayed more earnestly that God would undertake the office of a judge, and chastise the people. For though the Prophet really condoled with those who perished, and was touched, as I have said, with a serious concern for their public safety, he yet preferred the glory of God: when, therefore, he saw that boldness in sin increased through impunity, and that the Jews in a manlier mocked God 				when they found that they could sin without being punished, he could not endure such unbridled wantonness. Besides, the Prophet may have spoken thus, not only as expressing his own feeling, but what he felt in common with all the godly; as though he had undertaken here a public duty, and utters a complaint common to all the faithful: for it is probable that all the godly, in so disordered a state of things, mourned alike. <i>How long, then, shall I cry? How long, he says, 				shall I cry on account of violence?</i> that is, When all things are in disorder, when there is now no regard for equity and justice, but men abandon themselves, as it were with loose reins, unto all kinds of wickedness, how long, Lord, wilt thou take no notice? But in these words the Prophet not only egresses his own feelings, but makes this kind of preface, that the Jews might better understand that the time of vengeance was come; for they were become not only altogether 				intolerable to God, but also to his servants. God indeed had suspended his judgement, though he had been often solicited to execute it by his Prophet. It hence appears, that their wickedness had made such advances that it would be no wonder if they were now severely chastised by the Lord; for they had by their sins not only provoked him against them, but also all the godly and the faithful.</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.ii.iii-p11"></A><a name="iii.ii.iii-p11.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p12"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>How long wilt thou show me iniquity, and make me to see trouble?</i> Here the Prophet briefly relates the cause of his indignation, &#8212; that he could not, without great grief, yea, without anguish of mind, behold such evils prevailing among God&#8217;s chosen people; for they who apply this to the Chaldeans, do so strainedly, and without any necessity, and they 				have not observed the reason which I have stated &#8212; that the Prophet does not here teach the Jews, but prepares them for a coming judgement, as they could not but see that they were justly condemned, since they were proved guilty by the cry and complaints made by all the godly.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p13"></A>Now this passage teaches us, that all who really serve and love God, ought, according to the Prophet&#8217;s example, to burn with holy indignation whenever they see wickedness reigning without restraint among men, and especially in the Church of God. There is indeed nothing which ought to cause us more grief than to see men raging with profane contempt for God, and no regard had for his law and for divine truth, and all order trodden under 				foot. When therefore such a confusion appears to us, we must feel roused, if we have in us any spark of religion. If it be objected, that the Prophet exceeded moderation, the obvious answer is this, &#8212; that though he freely pours forth his feelings, there was nothing wrong in this before God, at least nothing wrong is imputed to him: for wherefore do we pray, but that each of us may unburden his cares, his griefs, and anxieties, by pouring them into the bosom of God? Since, then, God allows us 				to deal so familiarly with him, nothing wrong ought to be ascribed to our prayers when we thus freely pour forth our feelings, provided the bridle of obedience keeps us always within due limits, as was the case with the Prophet; for it is certain that he was retained under the influence of real kindness. Jeremiah did indeed pray with unrestrained fervor (<a name="iii.ii.iii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010">Jer 15:10</a><a name="iii.ii.iii-p13.1"></A>): but his case was different from 				that of our Prophet; for he proceeds not here to an excess, as Jeremiah did when he cursed the day of his birth, and when he expostulated with God for being made a man of contention. But our Prophet undertakes here the defense of justice; for he could not endure the law of God to be made a sport, and men to allow themselves every liberty in sinning.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p14"></A>We now, then, see that the Prophet can be justly excused, though he expostulates here with God, for God does not condemn this freedom in our prayers; but, on the contrary, the end of praying is, that every one of us pour forth, as it is said in the Psalms, his heart before God. As, then, we communicate our cares and sorrows to God, it is no wonder that the Prophet, according to the manner of men, says, Why dost thou 				show me iniquity, and make me to see trouble? Trouble is to be taken here in an active sense, and the verb <a name="iii.ii.iii-p14.1"></A>&#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1502;, <i>tabith</i>, has a transitive meaning.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>
 				 Some render it, Why dost thou look on trouble? as though the Prophet indignantly bore the connivance of God. But the context necessarily requires that this verb should be taken in a transitive sense. &#8220;Why dost thou show me iniquity?&#8221; and then, &#8220;and makest me to look on violence?&#8221; He says afterwards, in the third place, in my sight is violence. But I have said, that the word trouble is to be taken actively; for the prophet means not that he was worn out with 				weariness, but that wicked men were troublesome to the good and the innocent, as it is usually the case when a freedom in sinning prevails.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p20"></A>And <i>why</i>, he says, <i>are violence and plunder in my sight? and there is he who excites, etc.?</i> The verb <a name="iii.ii.iii-p20.1"></A>&#1504;&#1513;&#1488;, <i>nusha</i> means not here to undertake, as some render it; 				but, on the contrary, to raise. Others render it, &#8220;Who supports,&#8221; but this is frigid. Therefore the translation which I have stated is the most suitable &#8212; <i>And why is there one who excites strife and contention?</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p21"></A>But the Prophet here accuses them only of sins against the second table of the law: he speaks not of the superstitions of people, and of the corrupted worship of God; but he briefly says, that they had no regard for what was just and right: for the stronger any one was, the more he distressed the helpless and the innocent. It was then for this reason that he mentioned iniquity, trouble, plunder, violence, contention, strife. In short, 				the Prophet here deplores, that there was now no equity and no brotherly kindness among the people, but that robberies, rapines, and tyrannical violence prevailed everywhere. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.iv"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.ii.iv-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.iv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004">Habakkuk 1:4</a><a name="iii.ii.iv-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p2"></A><b>4.</b> Therefore the law is slacked, and judgement doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgement proceedeth.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p3"></A><b>4.</b> Propterea dissolvitur (<i>vel</i>, debilitatur) lex, et non egredietur perpetuo judicium (<i>vel</i>, non egreditur:) quia impius circumdat justum, propterea impius circumdat justum, propterea egredietur judicium perversum.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.ii.iv-p5"></A><a name="iii.ii.iv-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p6"></A>The Prophet confirms here what I have already said, and brings an excuse for his zeal; he proves that he was not without reason led to so great a warmth; for he saw that the law of God was trodden as it were under foot; he saw men so hardened in every kind of sin, that all religion and the fear of God had nearly been extinguished. Hence I have already said, that the Prophet was not here impelled by a carnal passion, as it often happens to 				us, when we defend ourselves from wrongs done to us; for when any one of us is injured, he immediately becomes incensed, while, at the same time, we suffer God&#8217;s law to be a sport, His whole truth to be despised, and everything that is just to be violated. We are only tender on what concerns us individually, and in the meantime we easily forgive when God is wronged, and His truth despised. But the Prophet shows here that he was not made indignant through a private feeling, but because he could 				not bear the profanation of God&#8217;s worship and the violation of His holy law.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p7"></A>He therefore says, that the law was dissolved or weakened, as though he said that God&#8217;s law had no longer any authority or regard. Let us hence learn to rouse up ourselves, for we are very frigid, when the ungodly openly despise and even mock God. As, then, we are too unconcerned in this respect, let us learn, by the Prophet&#8217;s example, to stimulate ourselves. For even Paul also shows, in an indirect way, that there is just reason for 				indignation &#8212; &#8216;Be ye angry,&#8217; he says, &#8216;and sin not,&#8217; (<a name="iii.ii.iv-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026">Eph 4:26</a><a name="iii.ii.iv-p7.1"></A>); that is, every one ought to regard his own sins, so as to become an enemy to himself; and he ought also to feel indignant whenever he sees God offended.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p8"></A>This rule the Prophet now follows, <i>Weakened</i>, he says, <i>is the law</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>
 				 We know that when a sinful custom prevails, there is but little authority in what is taught: nor are human laws only despised when men&#8217;s audacity breaks through all restraints, but even the very law of God is esteemed as nothing; for they think that everything erroneously done, by the consent of all, is lawful. We now then see that the Prophet felt great anguish of mind, like holy Lot (<a name="iii.ii.iv-p11.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001">Ge 19:1-38</a><a name="iii.ii.iv-p11.5"></A>.), when he saw every regard for God almost extinct in the land, and especially among the chosen people, whom God had above all others consecrated to himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p12"></A>He then adds, <i>judgement goes not forth perpetually</i>. Absurdly do many regard this as having been said in the person of foolish men, who think that there is no such thing as divine providence, when things in the world are in a disordered state: but the Prophet simply says, that all justice was suppressed. We have nearly the very same complaint in <a name="iii.ii.iv-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004">Isa 59:4</a><a name="iii.ii.iv-p12.1"></A>. He then says, that judgement did not go forth perpetually, because the ungodly thought that no account was to be given by them. When, therefore, any one dared to say a word against them, they immediately boiled with rage, and like wild beasts fiercely attacked him. All then were silent, and nearly made dumb, when the ungodly thus prevailed and gathered boldness from the daily practice of 				licentiousness. Hence, &#8216;Go forth perpetually does not judgement;&#8217; that is, &#8220;O Lord, things are now past hope, and there appears to be no end to our evils, except thou comest soon and applies a remedy beyond what our flesh can conceive.&#8221; <i>For the wicked</i>, he says, <i>surround the righteous</i>; that is, when there was any one who continued to retain some regard for religion and justice, immediately the 				wicked rose up against him on every side and surrounded him before and behind; so it happened, that no one dared to oppose the torrent, though frauds, rapines, outrages, cruelty, and even murders everywhere prevailed; if any righteous men still remained, they dared not come forth into the public, for the wicked beset them on all sides.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p13"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>Therefore perverted judgement goes forth</i>. The Prophet now rises higher, that even the rulers themselves increased the rage for evils, and as it were supplied fuel to their wickedness, as they confounded all distinction between right and wrong: for the Prophet speaks not here of private wrongs which any one might have done, but he speaks of the very 				rulers, as though he said, &#8220;There might have been one remedy, the judges might have checked so great an audacity; but they themselves stretch out their hands to the wicked and help them.&#8221; Hence the tribunals, which ought to have been sacred, were become as it were dens of thieves. The word <a name="iii.ii.iv-p13.1"></A>&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;, <i>meshiphith</i> is taken properly in a good 				sense: Is not judgement then a desirable thing? Yes, but the Prophet says, that it was perverted. It was then by way of concession that judgement is mentioned; for he afterwards adds a word to it, by which he shows that the administration of the laws was evil and injurious: for when any one oppressed had recourse to the assistance of the laws, he was plundered. In short, the Prophet means, that all things in private and in public were corrupt among the people. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.v"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.ii.v-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.v-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005">Habakkuk 1:5</a><a name="iii.ii.v-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p2"></A><b>5.</b> Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <i>I</i> will work a work in your days, <i>which</i> ye will not believe, though it be told <i>you</i></p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p3"></A><b>5.</b> Videte in gentibus, et aspicite, et admiramini, admiramini; quia opus operans in diebus vestris, non credetis, quum narratum fuerit.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.ii.v-p5"></A><a name="iii.ii.v-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p6"></A>The Prophet turns his discourse to the Jews, after having related the private colloquy, in which he expostulated with God for having so patiently borne with the obstinate wickedness of the nation. Being now as it were furnished with God&#8217;s command, (as the case really was,) he performs the office of a herald, and proclaims an approaching destruction. He indeed adopts a preface, which ought to have awakened drowsy and 				careless minds. He says &#8212; <i>look, see, be astonished, be astonished</i>; these repetitions do not a little increase the alarm; he twice bids them to see, and he twice exhorts them to be astonished, or to wonder. He then briefly proclaims the judgement of God, which he afterwards more fully describes. We now, then, perceive the object of the Prophet, and the manner in which he proceeds with his subject.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p7"></A>And he bids those among the nations to behold, as though he had said, that they were unworthy to be taught in the school of God; he therefore appointed other masters for them, even the Chaldeans, as we shall presently see. He might have said &#8212; look to God; but as the Prophet had so long spent his labor in vail and without profit while teaching them, he sets over them the Chaldeans as teachers. Behold, he says, ye teachers among the 				Gentiles. There is here indeed an implied contrast, as thought he said &#8212; &#8220;God has hitherto often recalled you to himself, and has offered himself to you, but ye have refused to look to him; now then, as he is wearied with exercising patience so long, he appoints for you other teachers; learn now from the Gentiles what ye leave hitherto refused to learn from the holy mouth of Cod himself&#8221;.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p8"></A>The Greek translators no doubt read <a name="iii.ii.v-p8.1"></A>&#1489;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, for their version is &#8212; &#8220;Behold, ye despisers.&#8221;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>
 				 But in Hebrew there is no ambiguity as to the word.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p10"></A>He afterwards adds &#8212; <i>And wonder ye, wonder</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>
 				 By these words the prophets express how dreadful God&#8217;s judgement would be, which would astonish the Jews themselves. Had they not been extremely refractory they might have quietly received instruction, for God would have addressed them by his prophets, as though they had been his own children. They might thus, with composed minds, have listened to God speaking to them; but the time was now come when they were to be filled with astonishment. We hence see that the 				Prophet meant this in a few words &#8212; that there would be a new mode of teaching, which would overwhelm the unwilling with astonishment, because they would not endure to be ruled in a gentle manner, when the Lord required nothing from them but to render themselves teachable.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p12"></A>After having said that God&#8217;s judgement would be dreadful, he adds that it was nigh at hand &#8212; <i>a work</i>, he says, <i>will he work in your days</i>, etc. They had already been often warned of that vengeance, but as they had for a long time disregarded it, they did ever remain sunk in their own self-delusions, like men who are wont to 				protract time and hunt on every side for some excuse for indulging themselves. So then when the people became hardened against all threatening, they thought that God would ever bear with them; hence the Prophet expressly declares, that the execution of that which they regarded as a fable was near at hand &#8212; <i>He will work</i>, he says, <i>this work in your days</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p13"></A>He then subjoins &#8212; <i>ye will not believe when it shall be told you</i>; that is, God will execute such a punishment as will be incredible and exceed all belief. The Prophet no doubt alludes to the want of faith in the people, and indirectly reproves them, as though he said &#8212; &#8220;Ye have hitherto denied faith to God&#8217;s word, but ye shall at length find that he has told the truth; 				and this ye shall find to your astonishment; for as his word has been counted by you incredible, so also incredible shall be his judgement.&#8221; In short, the Prophet intimates this &#8212; that though the Prophets had been derided by the Jews, and despised as inventors of fables, yet nothing had been said by them which would not be fully accomplished. This reward then was to be paid to all the unbelieving; for God would in the most dreadful manner avenge their impiety, so that they should themselves be 				astonished and become an astonishment to others. We now perceive what the Prophet meant by saying that the Jews would not believe the work of God when told them, that is, the vengeance which he will presently describe.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.v-p14"></A>This passage is quoted by Paul, and is applied to the punishment then awaiting the Jews; for Paul, after having offered Christ to them, and seeing that many of them regarded the preaching of Gospel with scorn, added these words &#8212; &#8220;see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and be astonished, for God will work a work in your days which ye shall not believe.&#8221; Paul at the same time made a suitable application of the Prophet&#8217;s words; for as God had once threatened his 				people by his Prophet Habakkuk, so he was still like himself; and since had so severely vindicated the contempt of his law as to his ancient people, he could not surely bear with the impiety of that people whom he found to have acted so malignantly and so ungratefully, yea so wantonly and perversely, as to reject his grace; for this was the last remedy for the Jews. No wonder then that Paul set before them this vengeance, when the Jews of his time persisted through their unbelief to reject 				Christ. Now follows the explanation -</p>  <a name="iii.ii.vi"></A>

<p><a name="iii.ii.vi-p6"></A>This verse is added by the Prophet as an explanation; for it was not enough to speak generally of God&#8217;s work, without reminding them that their destruction by the Chaldeans was nigh at hand. He does not indeed in this verse explain what would be the character of that judgement which he had mentioned in the last verse <a name="iii.ii.vi-p6.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005">Hab 1:5</a><a name="iii.ii.vi-p6.1"></A>; but he will do this in 				what follows. Now the Prophets differ from Moses in this respect, for they show, as it were by the finger, what he threatened generally, and they declare the special judgements of God; as it is indeed evident from the demonstrative adverb, &#8220;Behold.&#8221; How necessary this was, we may gather from the perverseness of that people; for how distinctly soever the Prophets showed to them God&#8217;s judgements, so that they saw them with their eyes, yet so great was their insensibility, that they despised 				denunciations so apparent. What, then, would have been done, if the Prophets had only said in general, &#8216;God will not spare you!&#8217; This, then, is the reason why the Prophet, having spoken of God&#8217;s terrible vengeance, now declares in express terms, that the Chaldeans were already armed by Him to execute His judgement. The rest we leave for tomorrow.</p>  <a name="iii.ii.vii"></A>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref26"><a name="iii.ii.viii-p1"></A>Lecture One Hundred and Seventh</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.viii-p2"></A>In the lecture of yesterday the Prophet began to show from whom the Jews were to expect the vengeance of God, even from the Chaldeans, who would come, not by their own instinct, but by the hidden impulse of God. God indeed testifies that he should be the author of this war, and that the Chaldeans would fight, as it were, under his auspices. <i>I am he</i>, <i>he says</i>, <i>who excites</i>, etc. Then by calling the Chaldeans <i>a bitter and hasty nation</i>, he intended seriously to terrify the Jews, who had heedlessly despised all threatenings.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>
 				 It was not indeed a subject of praise to the Chaldeans, that they were bitter and impetuous: but the Lord could turn these vices to a good purpose, inasmuch as he elicits light from darkness. When, therefore, we read that the Chaldeans were bitter, and also hasty, God thus intimates that he can employ the vices of men in executing his judgements, and yet contract hence no spot nor blemish; for we cannot possibly pollute him with our filth, as he scatters it far 				away by the brightness of his justice and equity.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.viii-p4"></A>He afterwards adds, <i>They shall march through the latitudes</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>
 				<i> of the earth, to possess habitations not their own</i>. He means that there would be no obstacles in the way of the Chaldeans, but that they would spread themselves over the whole earth, and occupy regions far remote. For they who fear, dare not thus disperse themselves, but, on the contrary, they advance cautiously with a collected army; but those, who have already obtained victory, march on to lay waste the land. This is what the Prophet 				says the Chaldeans would do.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.viii-p6"></A>The meaning is &#8212; that they would not come to carry on an uncertain warfare, but that they would enjoy a victory; for they would by an impetuous course fill the land, so as to occupy tents or habitations not their own. It was indeed a matter of blame in the Chaldeans, that they thus made inroads on their own neighbors: but, as I have said, God intended only to fill the Jews with terror, because he found that all threatenings were 				despised. He therefore meant to show how terrible the Chaldeans would be, and he confirms the same in the next verse.</p>  <a name="iii.ii.ix"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.ii.ix-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.ix-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#007">Habakkuk 1:7</a><a name="iii.ii.ix-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iii.ii.ix-p3"></A><b>7.</b> Terribilis et metuenda ipsa, ab ipsa judicium ejus (pro jure ponitur hoc nomen,) et exultatio (vel, dignitas) ejus egredietur.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.ix-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.ii.ix-p5"></A><a name="iii.ii.ix-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.ix-p6"></A>By saying that the Chaldeans would be terrible and dreadful, he praises not their virtues; but, as I have already reminded you, he shows that they would be prepared to do his service by executing his vengeance: and he so regulated his judgement, that he used their cruelty for a good purpose. Thus we see that the worst of men are in God&#8217;s hand, as Satan is, who is their head; and yet that God is not implicated in their wickedness, as some 				insane men maintain; for they say &#8212; That if God governs the world by his providence, he becomes thus the author of sin, and men&#8217;s sins are to be ascribed to him. But Scripture teaches us far otherwise, &#8212; that the wicked are led here and there by the hidden power of God, and that yet the fault is in them, when they do anything in a deceitful and cruel manner, and that God ever remains just, whatever use he may make of instruments, yea, the very worst.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.ix-p7"></A>But when the Prophet adds, that <i>its judgement would be from the nation itself</i>, he means that the Chaldeans would act according to their own will. When any one indeed obeys laws, and willingly submits to them, he will freely allow either judges or umpires in case of a dispute; but he who will have all things done according to his own purpose repudiates all judges. The 				Prophet therefore means, that the Chaldeans would be their own judges, so that the Jews or others would complain in vain for any wrongs done to them. &#8220;They shall be,&#8221; he says, &#8220;their own judges, and shall execute judgement, for they will not accept any arbitrators.&#8221; The word <i>judgement</i>, taken in a good sense, is put here for law (<i>jus</i>); as though he said, &#8220;Whatever the Chaldeans will claim for 				themselves, theirs shall it be; for no one will dare to interfere, and they will not submit to the will of others; but their power shall be for law, and their sword for a tribunal.&#8221; We now understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning; and we must ever bear in mind what I have already said, &#8212; That God had no participation in these vices; but it was necessary that the stubbornness of an irreclaimable people should be thus corrected, or at least broken down. The Lord in the meantime could use such instruments 				in such a way as to preserve some moderation in his judgements. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.x"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.ii.x-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.x-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008">Habakkuk 1:8</a><a name="iii.ii.x-p1.1"></A></p>

<p><a name="iii.ii.x-p3"></A><b>8.</b> Et velociores pardis equi ejus, et acutiores lupis vespertinis: et multiplicati sunt equites ejus, et equites ejus e longinquo venient; volabunt quasi aquila festinans ad comedendum (<i>vel</i>, ad cibum.)</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.x-p4"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.ii.x-p5"></A><a name="iii.ii.x-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.x-p6"></A>The design of these figurative expressions is the same. The Prophet had spoken of the cruelty of those enemies whom the Jews despised: he now adds, that they would be so active as to surpass in velocity both leopards and eagles, or to be at least equal to them. He then says first, that their horses would be swifter then leopards. The Jews might have eluded his threatenings, or at least have cherished their insensibility by a vain 				confidence, as we see how this vice prevails in the world; for they might have thought thus within themselves, &#8220;The Chaldeans are far away, and the danger of which the Prophet speaks cannot be so near at hand.&#8221; Hence he declares that their horses would be swifter than leopards.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.x-p7"></A>He then adds, that <i>they would be fiercer than the evening wolves</i>. The wolf is a rapacious animal; and when he ranges about all the day in vain seeking what he may devour, then in the evening hunger kindles his rage. There is, therefore, nothing more dreadful than hungry wolves. But, as I have said, except they find some prey about the evening, they become the more furious. 				We shall meet with the same simile in <a name="iii.ii.x-p7.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001">Zep 3:1</a><a name="iii.ii.x-p7.1"></A>. We now see the drift of the Prophet&#8217;s words.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.x-p8"></A>He adds that <i>their horsemen would be numerous</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>
 				 He now sets forth their power, lest the Jews should have recourse to vain hopes, because they might obtain some help either from the Egyptians or other neighbors. The Prophet shows that all such hopes would be wholly vain; for had they gathered auxiliaries from all quarters, still the Chaldeans would exceed them in power and number.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.x-p12"></A>He afterwards says, that <i>their horsemen would come from a distance</i>. Though they should have a long journey, yet weariness would not hinder and delay them in coming from a remote part. The toil of travelling would not weaken them, until they reached Judea. How so? Because it will fly, he says, (he speaks throughout of the nation itself,) <i>as an 				eagle hastening to devour</i>. This metaphor is also most suitable to the present purpose; for it signifies, that wherever the Chaldeans saw a prey, they would instantly come, as an eagle to any carcass it may observe. Let the distance be what it may, as soon as it sees a prey, it takes a precipitate flight, and is soon present to devour; for the rapidity of eagles, as it is well known, is astonishing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.x-p13"></A>We now see that what we learn from the Prophet&#8217;s words is substantially this, &#8212; that God&#8217;s judgement ought to have been feared, because he purposed to employ the Chaldeans as his servants, whose cruel disposition and inhumanity would be dreadful: he also shows that the Chaldeans would be far superior in power and number; and in third place he makes it known, that they would possess an astonishing rapidity, and that though length of 				journey might be deemed a hindrance, they would yet be like eagles, which come like an arrow from heaven to earth, whenever a prey is observed by them. And eagles are not only rapid in their flight, but they possess also sharpness of sight; for we know that the eyes of eagles are remarkably keen and strong: and it is said that they cast away their young, if they find that they cannot look steadily at the sun; for they regard them as spurious. The Prophet then intimates that the Chaldeans would 				from a distance observe their prey: as the eagles, who are endued with incredible quickness of sight, see from mid air every carcass lying on the ground; so also would the Chaldeans quickly discover a prey, and come upon it in an instant. Let us proceed.</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xi"></A>

<p><a name="iii.ii.xi-p6"></A>By saying that they would come to the prey, he means that they would have no trouble or labor, for they would be victorious before they had any contest, or had any war with their enemies. The meaning then is, that the Chaldeans would not come to spend much time in warfare, as when there is a strong power to resist; but that they would only come for the booty, for the Jews would be frightened, and instantly submit themselves. And by these 				words the Prophet intimates, that there would be neither strength nor courage in a people so refractory: for God thus debilitates the hearts of those who fiercely resist his word. Whenever, then, men become strong against God, he so melts their hearts, that they cannot resist their fellow-mortals; and thus he mocks their confidence, or rather their madness. Lest then the Jews should still harbor any hope from the chance of war, the Prophet says that the Chaldeans would only come for the prey, 				for all would become subject to them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xi-p7"></A>He afterwards adds, that <i>the meeting of their faces would be like the oriental wind</i>. The word <a name="iii.ii.xi-p7.1"></A>&#1490;&#1502;&#1492;, <i>gime</i>, means what is opposite; and its derivative signifies meeting or opposition (<i>occursus</i>.) We indeed know that the east wind was very injurious to the land of Judea, that it dried up vegetation, yea, that it consumed as it were the whole produce of the earth. The violence of that wind was also very great. Hence whenever the Prophets wished to express a violent impetuosity, they added this comparison of the east wind. It was therefore the same as though the Prophet had said that the Jews would now in vain flatter themselves; for as soon 				as they perceived the blowing of the east wind, they would flee away, knowing that they would be wholly unable to stand against it.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xi-p14"></A>Hence follows what is added by the Prophets, <i>He shall gather the captivity like the sand</i>; that is, the king of Babylon shall without any trouble subdue all the people, and collect captives innumerable as the sand; for by the sand of the sea is meant an immense number of men. In short, the Prophet shows that the Jews were already conquered; because their striving and 				their contest had been with God, whom they had so often and so obstinately provoked; and also, because God had chosen for himself such servants as excelled in quickness, and power, and cruelty. This is the sum of the whole. He afterwards adds &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xii"></A>

<p><a name="iii.ii.xii-p6"></A>The Prophet concludes the subject which he has been hitherto pursuing. He says that the Chaldeans would not come to engage in a doubtful war, but only to triumph over conquered nations. We indeed know that the Jews, though not excelling either in number or in riches, were yet so proud, that they looked down, as it were, with contempt on other nations, and we also know, that they vainly trusted in vain helps; for as they 				were in confederacy with the Egyptians, they thought themselves to be beyond the reach of danger. Hence the Prophet says, that kings and princes would be only a sport to the Chaldeans, and their fortresses would be only a derision to them. How so? For <i>they will gather dust</i>, he says; that is, will make a mound of the dust of the earth, and will thus penetrate into all fortified cities.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xii-p7"></A>In short the Prophet intended to cut off every hope from the Jews, that they might humble themselves before God; or he intended to take away every excuse if they repented not, as it indeed happened; for we know that they did not repent notwithstanding these warnings, until vengeance at length fully overtook them. He then adds &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xiii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011">Habakkuk 1:11</a><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p1.1"></A></p>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p5"></A><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p6"></A>The Prophet now begins to give some comfort to the faithful, lest they should succumb under so grievous evils. He has hitherto directed his discourse to that irreclaimable people, but he now turns to the remnant; for there were always among them some of the faithful, though few, whom God never neglected; yea, for their sake often he sent his prophets; for though the multitude derived no benefit, yet the faithful understood that God did 				not threaten in vain, and were thus retained in his fear. This was the reason why the prophets were wont, after having spoken generally, to come down to the faithful, and as it were to comfort them apart and privately. And this difference ought to be noticed, as we have said elsewhere; for when the prophets denounce God&#8217;s wrath, the discourse then is directed indiscriminately to the whole body of the people; but when they add promises, it is then as though they called the faithful to a private 				conference, and spake in their ear what had been committed to them by the Lord. The truth might have been useful to all, had they returned to a right mind; but as almost the whole people had hardened themselves in their vices, and as Satan had rendered stupid the minds and hearts of nearly all, it behaved the Prophet to have a special regard to the chosen of God. We now then apprehend his design.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p7"></A>And he says &#8212; <i>now he will change his spirit</i>. He bids the faithful to entertain hope, because the Chaldeans, after having poured forth all their fury, will be punished by the Lord for their arrogance, for it will be intolerable. This may indeed seem frigid to ungodly men; for what wonder is it that the Chaldeans, after having obtained so many victories, should grow 				haughty and exult in their success, as is commonly the case? But as this is a fixed principle with us, that men&#8217;s pride becomes intolerable to God when they extremely exult and preserve no moderation &#8212; this is a very powerful argument &#8212; that is, that whosoever thus raises his horns shall suddenly be laid prostrate by the Lord. And Scripture also ever sets this before us, that God beats down supercilious pride, and does this that we may know that destruction is nigh all the ungodly, when they 				thus grow violently mad, and know not that they are mortals. It was then for this reason that the Prophet mentions what he says here; it was that the faithful might hope for some end to the violence of their enemies, for God would check their pride when they should transgress. But he says &#8212; <i>then He will change his spirit</i>; not that there was before any humility in the Chaldeans, but that success inebriated them, yea, and deprived them of all 				reason. And it is a common thing that a person who has fortune as it were in his hand, forgets himself, and thinks himself no longer a mortal. Great kings do indeed confess that they are men; but we see how madness lays hold on them; for, as I have said, being deluded by prosperity, they deem themselves to be nothing less than gods.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p8"></A>The Prophet refers here to the king of Babylon and all his people. He will change, he says, his spirit; that is, success will take away from him whatever reason and moderation he had. Now since the proud betray themselves and their disposition when fortune smiles on them, let us learn to form our judgement of men according to this experiment. If we would judge rightly of any man we must see how he bears good and bad fortune; for it may 				be that he who has borne adversity with a patient, calm and resigned mind, will disappoint us in prosperity, and will so elate himself as to be wholly another man. The Prophet then does not without reason speak of a change of spirit; for though the Chaldeans were before proud, they were not so extremely haughty as when their pride passed all bounds, after their many victories. He will change then his spirit; not that the Chaldeans were another kind of people, but that the Lord thus discovered 				their madness which was before hid.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p9"></A>He then adds &#8212; <i>he will pass over</i>. The Prophet intended to express that when the Lord suffered the Chaldeans to rule far and wide, a way was thus opened for his judgements, which is far different from the judgement of the flesh. For the more power men acquire the more boldness they assume; and it seemed to tend to the establishing of their power that they knew how to use 				their success. But the Lord, as I have said, was secretly preparing a way to destroy them, when they thus became proud and passed all bounds; hence the Prophet does not simply condemn the haughtiness and pride of the Chaldeans, but shows that a way is already open, as it were, for God&#8217;s judgement, that he might destroy them, inasmuch as they would render themselves intolerable.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p10"></A>He afterwards adds &#8212; <i>and shall act impiously</i>. The verb <a name="iii.ii.xiii-p10.1"></A>&#1488;&#1513;&#1501;, <i>ashem</i> I refer to the end of the verse &#8212; where he ascribes his power to his own god. And the Prophet adds this explanation, in order that the Jews 				might know what kind of sin would be the sin of the king of Babylon. He then charges him with sacrilege, because he would think that he had become the conqueror of Judea through the kindness of his idol, so that he would make nothing of the power and glory of the true God. Since then the Babylonian would transfer God&#8217;s glory to his own idol, his own ruin would be thus made ripe; for the Lord would undertake his own cause, and execute vengeance on such a sacrilege; for he speaks here no doubt of 				the Babylonian, and according to his view, when he says &#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p11"></A><i>This his strength is that of his god</i>; but were any inclined to explain this of the true God, as some do, he would make a harsh and a forced construction; for the Babylonians did not worship the true God, but were devoted, as it is well known, to their own superstitions. The Prophet then no doubt makes known here to the faithful the pride with which the Babylonians would become elated, and thus 				provoke God&#8217;s wrath against themselves; and also the sacrilegious boasting in which they would indulge, ascribing the victories given them to their own idols, which could not be done without daring reproach to the true God.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.ii.xiv-p6"></A>The Prophet now exulting, according to what all the faithful feel, shows the effect of what he has just mentioned; for as ungodly men wantonly rise up against God, and, while Satan renders them insane, throw out swelling words of vanity, as though they could by speaking confound earth and heaven; so also the faithful derive a holy confidence from God&#8217;s word, and set themselves against them, and overcome their ferocity by the magnanimity 				and firmness of their own minds, so that they can intrepidly boast that they are happy and blessed even in the greatest miseries.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiv-p7"></A>This then is what the prophet means when he adds &#8212; <i>Art not thou our God?</i> The question is much more emphatical than if he had simply declared that the true God was worshipped in Judea, and would therefore be the protector of that nation; for when the Prophet puts a question, he means, according to what is commonly understood in Hebrew, that the thing admits of no doubt. 				&#8220;What! art not thou our God?&#8221; We hence see that there is a contrast between the wicked and impious boastings in which the profane indulge, and the holy confidence which the faithful have, who exult in their God. But that the discourse is addressed to God rather than to the ungodly is not done without reason, for it would have been useless to contend with the wicked. This is indeed sometimes necessary, for when the reprobate openly reproach God we cannot restrain ourselves; nor is it right that 				we refrain from testifying that we regard all their slanders as of no account; but we cannot so courageously oppose their audacity as when we have the matter first settled between us and God, and be able to say with the Prophets &#8212; &#8220;Thou art our God.&#8221; Whosoever then would boldly contend with the ungodly must first have to do with God, and confirm and ratify as it were that compact which God has proposed to us, even that we are his people, and that he in his turn will be always our God. As then 				God thus covenants with us, our faith must be really made firm, and then let us go forth and contend against all the ungodly. This is the order which the Prophet observes here, and what is to be observed by us &#8212; Art not thou our God?</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiv-p8"></A>He also adds &#8212; <i>long since</i>, <a name="iii.ii.xiv-p8.1"></A>&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, <i>mekodam</i>, by which word the Prophet invites the attention of the faithful to the covenant which God had made, not yesterday nor the day before that, with his people, but many ages 				before, even 400 years before he redeemed their fathers from Egypt. Since then the favor of God to the Jews had been confirmed for so long a time, it is not without reason that the Prophet says here &#8212; <i>Thou art our God from the beginning</i>; that is, &#8220;the religion which we embrace has been delivered to us by thy hands, and we know that thou art its author; for our faith recumbs not on the opinion of men, but is sustained by thy word. Since, then, we 				have found so often and in so many ways, and for so many years, that thou art our God, there is now no room for doubt.&#8221;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiv-p12"></A>He then subjoins &#8212; <i>we shall not die</i>. What the Jews say of this place, that it had been corrected by the scribes, seems not to me probable; for the reason they give is very frivolous. They suppose that it was written lo tamut, Thou diest not, and that the letter nun had been introduced, &#8220;we shall not die,&#8221; because the expression offended those scribes, as though the 				Prophet compared God to men, and ascribed to him a precarious immortality; but they would have been very foolish critics. I therefore think that the word was written by the Prophet as we now read it, Thou art our God, we shall not die. Some explain this as a prayer &#8212; &#8220;let us not die;&#8221; and the future is often taken in this sense in Hebrew; but this exposition is not suitable to the present passage; for the Prophet, as I have already said, rises up here as a conqueror, and disperses as mists all 				those foolish boastings of which he had been speaking, as though he said &#8212; &#8220;we shall not die, for we are under the protection of God.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiv-p13"></A>I have already explained why he turns his discourse to God: but this is yet the conclusion of the argument, &#8212; that as God had adopted that people, and received them into favor, and testified that he would be their defender, the Prophet confidently draws this inference, &#8212; that this people cannot perish, for they are preserved by God. No power of the world, nor any of its defences, can indeed afford us this security; for whatever forces 				may all mortals bring either to protect or help us, they shall all perish together with us. Hence, the protection of God alone is that which can deliver us from the danger of death. We now perceive why the Prophet joins together these two things, &#8220;Thou art our God,&#8221; and &#8220;We shall not die;&#8221; nor can indeed the one be separated from the other; for when we are under the protection of God, we must necessarily continue safe and safe for ever; not that we shall be free from evils, but that the Lord 				will deliver us from thousand deaths, and ever preserve our life in safety. When only he affords us a taste of eternal salvation, some spark of life will ever continue in our hearts, until he shows to us, when at length redeemed, as I have already said, from thousand deaths, the perfection of that blessed life, which is now promised to us, but as yet is looked for, and therefore hid under the custody of hope.</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xv"></A>  			 
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld27"><a name="iii.ii.xv-p1"></A>Prayer</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xv-p2"></A>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou settest around us so many terrors, we may know that we ought to be roused, and to resist the sloth and tardiness of our flesh, so that thou mayest fortify us by a different confidence: and may we so recumb on thine aid, that we may boldly triumph over our enemies, and never doubt, but that thou wilt at length give us the victory over all the assaults of Satan and of the wicked; and may we also so look to thee, 				that our faith may wholly rest on that eternal and immutable covenant, which has been confirmed for us by the blood of thy only Son, until we shall at length be united to him who is our head, after having passed through all the miseries of the present life, and having been gathered into that eternal inheritance, which thy Son has purchased for us by his own blood.

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref26"><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p1"></A>Lecture One hundred and Eighth</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p2"></A>We began yesterday to explain the words of the Prophet, by which he encouraged himself and the faithful, and obtained support under circumstances bordering on despair; for he turned to God, when he saw the wicked, not only elated with prosperity, but also pouring forth blasphemies against the living God. The Prophet then says, that those who are under God&#8217;s protection shall not perish. Of this he felt assured within himself. The 				declaration, as I have said, is much more striking, as the Prophet turns all his thoughts towards God, than if he had publicly and loudly declared what he testified, as it were, in a private conference.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p3"></A>But it was not without reason that he said, "Thou, my God, my holy one;&#8221; as though he had said, &#8220;I trust in thee, inasmuch as I am one of thy chosen people.&#8221; He does not indeed speak here in his own private name, but includes with himself the whole Church; for this privilege belonged to all the children of Abraham, as they had been set apart by the gratuitous adoption of God, and were a royal priesthood. This is the 				reason why the Prophet says, <i>Thou, my God, my holy one</i>. For the Jews were wont thus to call God, because they had been chosen from the rest of the world. And their holiness was, that God had deigned to take them as his people, having rejected others, while yet there was by nature no difference between them.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p5"></A>There is, moreover, much weight in the words which follow, <i>Jehovah! for judgement has thou set him</i>. This temptation ever occurs to us, whenever we strive to put our trust in God &#8212; What does this mean? for God now forsakes us, and exposes us to the caprice of the wicked they are allowed to do what they please, and God interferes not. How, then, can we cherish hope under 				these perplexities?&#8221; The Prophet now sets up a shield against this temptations &#8212; &#8220;Thou,&#8221; he says, &#8220;hast appointed him for judgement.&#8221; For he ascribes it to God&#8217;s providence, that the Assyrians had with so much wantonness wasted the land, or would waste it when they came; for he speaks of things yet future &#8212; &#8220;Thou,&#8221; he says, &#8220;hast appointed him for judgement.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p6"></A>This is a truth much needed: for Satan darkens, as with clouds, the favor of God, when any adversity happens to us, and when God himself thus proves our faith. But adversities are as it were clouds, excluding us from seeing God&#8217;s fervor, as the light of the sun appears not to us when the sky is darkened. If, indeed, the mass of evils be so great and so thick, that our minds are overwhelmed, they are not clouds, but the 				thick darkness of night. In that case our faith cannot stand firm, except the providence of God comes to our view, so that we may know, in the midst of such confusion, why he permits so much liberty to the wicked, and also how their attempts may turn out, and what may be the issue. Except then we be fully persuaded, that God by his secret providence regulates all these confusions, Satan will a hundred times a day, yea every moment, shake that confidence which ought to repose in God. We now see 				how opportunely the Prophet adds this clause. He had said, &#8220;Art not thou our God? we shall not die.&#8221; He now subjoins this by way of anticipation, &#8220;The Assyrians indeed do lay waste thy land as with an unbridled wantonness, they plunder thy people, and with impunity slay the innocent; but, O Lord, this is not done but by thy permission: Thou overrules all these confused proceedings, nor is all this done by thee without a cause. Thou, Jehovah, <i>hast for judgement appointed 				him</i>. &#8212; Judgement is to be taken for chastisement.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p7"></A>But the Prophet repeats the same thing, <i>and, being strong, thou hast for correction established him</i>. Some render <a name="iii.ii.xvi-p7.1"></A>&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, <i>tsur</i> strong, in the accusative case, and give a twofold explanation. One party apply the term 				to the Jews, who were to be subdued by hard means, since they were so refractory; and hence they think that the Jews are called strong, because they were like stones. Others give this meaning, <i>Thou hast made him strong to correct</i>; that is, Thou hast given him strength, by which he will chastise us. But as this is one of God&#8217;s titles, I doubt not but that the two clauses correspond. He now, then, gives this name to God. Having given him his name 				as an eternal God, <i>Thou, Jehovah</i>, etc.; he now calls him <i>strong</i>. He puts <a name="iii.ii.xvi-p7.2"></A>&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, <i>tsur</i> to correspond with Jehovah; and then to <i>correct</i>, to correspond with <i>judgement</i>. We hence see how well the whole context agrees, and how the words answer, the one to the other. Then it is, <i>Thou, strong one, hast established him to correct</i>. But why does the Prophet call him <i>strong</i>? though this title, as I have said, is commonly ascribed to God, yet the Prophet, I have no doubt, had regard to the circumstances at the time. It is 				indeed difficult to retain this truth, &#8212; that the world is ruled by the secret counsel of God, when things are turned upside down: for the profane then glamour against God, and charge him with listlessness; and others cry out, that all things are thus changed fortuitously and at random; and hence they call fortune blind. It is then difficult, as I have said, to retain a fast hold on this truth. The Prophet, therefore, in order to support his own weakness, sets before himself this title of God, 				<i>Thou, the strong God</i>, or the <i>rock</i>, etc.; for <a name="iii.ii.xvi-p7.3"></A>&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;, <i>tsur</i> means properly a rock, but it is to be taken here for God of strength. Why? &#8220;Behold, we indeed see revolutions, which not only make our faith to totter, but also dissipate as it were 				all our thoughts: but how much soever the world revolve in confusion, yet God is a rock; His purpose fails not, nor wavers; but remains ever firm.&#8221; We now then see why the Prophet calls God strong.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p11"></A>Thou the strong one, he says, hast established him. He expresses more by the word <i>established</i>, than in the first clause: for he prepared himself with firmness against continued evils, in case God (as it might be easily conjectured) would not give immediate relief to his people, but add calamities to calamities. Should God then join evils to evils, the Prophet prepares himself for perseverance; &#8220;Thou,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the strong one 				hast established him;&#8221; that is, &#8220;Though the Assyrian should not only like a whirlwind or a violent tempest rush upon us, but also continue to oppress us, as though he were a pestilence attached to the land, or some fixed mountain, yet thou, Lord, hast established him.&#8221; For what purpose? <i>to correct</i>. But the Prophet could not have said this, had he not known that God justly chastised his people. Not only for his own sake did he say this; but he intended also, by his own example, to lead 				the faithful to make the same holy and pious confession.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p12"></A>The two clauses of this sentence then are these, that though the Assyrian would rage with unbridled wantonness, like a cruel wild beast, he would yet be restrained by the hidden power of God, to whom it peculiarly belongs to overrule by his secret providence the confusions of this world. This is one thing. The Prophet also ascribes justice to God&#8217;s power, and thus confesses his own guilt and that of the people; for the Lord would justly 				use so severe a scourge, because the people needed such a correction. Let us now go on &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xvii"></A>

<p><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p6"></A>The Prophet here expostulates with God, not as at the beginning of the chapter; for he does not here, with a holy and calm mind, undertake the defense of God&#8217;s glory, but complains of injuries, as men do when oppressed, who go to the judge and implore his protection. This complaint, then, is to be distinguished from the former one; for at the beginning of the chapter the Prophet did not plead his own cause or that of the people; but 				zeal for God&#8217;s glory roused him, so that he in a manner asked God to take vengeance on so great an obstinacy in wickedness; but he now comes down and expresses the feelings of men; for he speaks of the thoughts and sorrows of those who had suffered injuries under the tyranny of their enemies.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p7"></A>And he says, O God, <i>thou art pure in eyes, thou lookest not on evil</i>. Some render the verb <a name="iii.ii.xvii-p7.1"></A>&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;, <i>theur</i> in the imperative mood, <i>clear the eyes</i>; but they are 				mistaken; for the verse contains two parts, the one contrary to the other. The Prophet reasons from the nature of God, and then he states what is of an opposite character. Thou, God, he says, <i>art pure in eyes</i>; hence thou canst not look on evil; it is not consistent with thy nature to pass by the vices of men, for every iniquity is hateful to thee. Thus the Prophet sets before himself the nature of God. Then he adds, that experience is opposed to 				this; for the wicked, he says, exult; and while they miserably oppress the innocent, no one affords any help. How is this, except that God sleeps in heaven, and neglects the affairs of men? We now then understand the Prophet&#8217;s meaning in this verse.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p12"></A>By saying that God is <i>pure in eyes</i>, he assumes what ought to be deemed certain and indubitable by all men of piety. But as God&#8217;s justice does not always appear, the Prophet has a struggle; and he shows that he in a manner vacillated, for he did not see in the state of things before him what yet his piety dictated to him, that is, that God was just and upright. It is 				indeed true, that the second part of the verse borders on blasphemy: for though the Prophet ever thought honourably and reverently of God, yet he murmurs here, and indirectly charges God with too much tardiness, as he connived at things, while he saw the just shamefully oppressed by the wicked. But we must notice the order which the Prophet keeps. For by saying that God is pure in eyes, he no doubt restrains himself. As there was danger lest this temptation should carry him too far, he meets it 				in time, and includes himself, in a manner, within this boundary &#8212; that we ought to retain a full conviction of God&#8217;s justice. The same order is observed by Jeremiah when he says, &#8216;I know, Lord, that thou art just, but how is it that the ungodly do thus pervert all equity? and thou either takest no notice, or dost not apply any remedy. I would therefore freely contend with thee.&#8217; The Prophet does not immediately break out into such an expression as this, &#8220;O Lord, I will contend with thee in 				judgement:&#8221; but before he mentions his complaint, knowing that his feelings were strongly excited, he makes a kind of preface, and in a manner restrains himself, that he might check that extreme ardor which might have otherwise carried him beyond due bounds; &#8220;Thou art just, O Lord,&#8221; he says. In a similar manner does our prophet speak here, <i>Thou art pure in eyes, so as not to behold evil; and thou canst not look on trouble</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p13"></A>Since, he says, <i>thou canst not look on trouble</i>, we find that he confirms himself in that truth &#8212; that the justice of God cannot be separated from his very nature: and by saying, <a name="iii.ii.xvii-p13.1"></A>&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1500;, <i>la</i> <i>tucal</i>, &#8220;thou canst not,&#8221; it is the same as though he had said, &#8220;Thou, O Lord, art just, because thou art God; and God, because thou art just.&#8221; For these two things cannot be separated, as both the eternity, and the very being of God, cannot stand without his justice. We hence see how strenuously the Prophet struggled against his own impetuosity, so that he might not too much indulge himself in the complaint, which immediately follows.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p14"></A>For he then asks, according to the common judgement of the flesh, <i>Why dost thou look on, when the ungodly devours one more just than himself?</i> The Prophet here does not divest God of his power, but speaks in doubt, and contends not so much with God as with himself. A profane man would have said, &#8220;There is no God, there is no providence,&#8221; or, &#8220;He cares not for the world, 				he takes his pleasure in heaven.&#8221; But the Prophet says, &#8220;Thou seest, Lord.&#8221; Hence he ascribes to God what peculiarly belongs to him &#8212; that he does not neglect the world which he has created. At the same time he here inclines two ways, and alternates; <i>Why does thou look on, when the ungodly devours one more just than himself?</i> He says not that the world revolves by chance, nor that God takes his delight and ease in heaven, as the Epicureans hold; 				but he confesses that the world is seen by God, and that he exercises care over the affairs of men: notwithstanding, as he could not see his way clear in a state of things so confused, he argues the point rather with himself than with God. We now see the import of this sentence. The Prophet, however, proceeds &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xviii"></A>

<p><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p8"></A>He goes on, as it has been said, in his complaint; and by a comparison he shows that the judgement would be such as though God turned away from men, so as not to check the violence of the wicked, nor oppose his hand to their wantonness, in order to restrain them. Since, then, every one would oppress another as he exceeded him in power, and would with increased insolence rise up against the miserable and the poor, the 				Prophet compares man to the fish of the sea, &#8212; &#8220;What can this mean?&#8221; he says. &#8220;For men have been created after God&#8217;s image: why then does not some justice appear among them? When one devours another, and even one man oppresses almost the whole world, what can be the meaning of this? God seems to sport with human affairs. For if he regards men as his children, why does he not defend them by his power? But we see one man (for he speaks of the Assyrian king) so enraged and so cruel, as though the 				rest of the world were like fish or reptiles.&#8221; <i>Thou makes men</i>, he says, <i>like reptiles or fishes</i>; and then he adds, <i>He draws up the whole by his hook, he collects them into his drag, he gathers then into his net, he exults</i>    				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p13"></A>We now see what the Prophet means &#8212; that God would, as it were, close his eyes, while the Assyrians wantonly laid waste the whole world: and when this tyranny should reach the holy land, what else could the faithful think but that they were forsaken by God? And there is nothing, as I have already said, more monstrous, than that iniquitous tyranny should thus prevail among men; for they have all, from the least to the greatest, been 				created after God&#8217;s image. God then ought to exercise peculiar care in preserving mankind; his paternal love and solicitude ought in this respect to appear evident: but when men are thus destroyed with impunity, and one oppresses almost all the rest, there seems indeed to be no divine providence. For how will it be that he will care for either birds, or oxen, or asses, or trees, or plants, when he will thus forsake men, and bring no aid in so confused a state? We now understand the drift of 				what the Prophet says.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p14"></A>But yet he does not, as I have already said, take away from God his power, nor does he here rail against fortune, as many cavillers do. Thou makest men, he says: he ascribes to God what cannot be taken from him, &#8212; that he governs the world. But as to God&#8217;s justice, he hesitates, and appeals to God. Though the Prophet seems here to rush headlong like insane men; yet if we consider all things, we shall see that he strenuously contended 				with his temptations, and even in these words some sparks at least of faith will shine forth, which are sufficient to show to us the great firmness of the Prophet. For this especially is worthy of being noticed, &#8212; that the Prophet turns himself to God. The Epicureans, when they glamour against God, for the most part, seek the ear of the multitude; and so they speak evil of God and withdraw themselves at a distance from him; for they do not think that he exercises any care over the world. But 				the Prophet continually addresses God. He knew then that God was the governor of all things. He also desires to be extricated from thoughts so thorny and perplexing; and from whom does he seek relief? From God himself. When the profane wantonly deride God, they indulge themselves, and seek nothing else but to become hardened in their own impious conjectures: but the Prophet comes to God himself, &#8220;How does this happen, O Lord?&#8221; As though he had said,</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p15"></A>&#8220;Thou sees how I am distracted, and also held fast bound &#8212; distracted by many absurd thoughts, so that I am almost confounded, and held fast bound by great perplexities, from which I cannot extricate myself. Do thou, O Lord, unfold to me these knots, and concentrate my scattered thoughts, that I may understand what is true, and what I am to believe; and especially remove from me this doubt, lest it should shake my faith; O Lord, grant that I 				may at length know and fully understand how thou art just, and overrules, consistently with perfect equity, those things which seem to be so confused.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p16"></A>It also happens sometimes that the ungodly, as it were, openly revile God, a satanic rage having taken possession on them. But the case was far different with the Prophet; for finding himself overwhelmed and his mind not able to sustain him under so heavy trials, he sought relief, and as we have said, applied to God himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p17"></A>By saying, <i>He therefore rejoices and exults</i>, he increases the indignity; for though the Lord may for a time permit the wicked to oppress the innocent, yet when he finds them glorying in their vices and triumphing, so great a wantonness ought the more to kindle his vengeance. That the Lord then should still withhold himself, seems indeed very strange. But the Prophet 				proceeds &#8212;</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xix"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption28"><a name="iii.ii.xix-p1"></A><a name="iii.ii.xix-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016">Habakkuk 1:16</a><a name="iii.ii.xix-p1.1"></A></p>

<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref30"><a name="iii.ii.xix-p5"></A><a name="iii.ii.xix-p5.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xix-p6"></A>The Prophet confirms the closing sentence of the last verse; for he explains what that joy was of which he had spoken, even the joy by which the wicked, as it were, designedly provoke God against themselves. It is indeed an abominable thing when the ungodly take delight in their vices; but it is still more atrocious when they deride God himself. Such, then, is the account now added by the Prophet, as though he had said, &#8220;Not only do the 				ungodly felicitate themselves while thou sparest them, or for a time bearest with them; but they now rise up against thee and deride all thy majesty, and openly blaspheme against heaven itself; for they sacrifice to their own net, and offer incense to their drag.&#8221; By this metaphor the Prophet intimates, that the wicked do not only become hardened when they succeed in their vices, but that they also ascribe to themselves the praise of justice; for they consider that to be rightly done which has 				been attended with success. They thus dethrone God, and put themselves in his place. We now then see the Prophet&#8217;s meaning.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xix-p7"></A>But this passage discovers to us the secret impiety of all those who do not serve God sincerely and with an honest mind. There is indeed imprinted on the hearts of men a certain conviction respecting the existence of a God; for none are so barbarous as not to have some sense of religion: and thus all are rendered inexcusable, as they carry in their hearts a law which is sufficient to make them a thousand times guilty. 				But at the same time the ungodly, and those who are not illuminated by faith, bury this knowledge, for they are enveloped in themselves: and when some recollection of God creeps in, they are at first impressed, and ascribe some honor to him; but this is evanescent, for they soon suppress it as much as they can; yea they even strive to extinguish (though they cannot) this knowledge and whatever light they have from heaven. This is what the Prophet now graphically sets forth in the person of the 				Assyrian king. He had before said, &#8220;This power is that of his God.&#8221; He had complained that the Assyrians would give to their idols what was peculiar to God alone, and thus deprive him of his right: but he says now, that they would <i>sacrifice to their own drag, and offer incense to their net</i>. This is a very different thing: for how could they sacrifice to their idols, if they ascribed to their drag whatever victories they had gained? Now, by the 				words drag and net, the Prophet means their efforts, strength, forces, power, counsels, and policies as they call them, and whatever else there be which profane men arrogate to themselves. But what is it to sacrifice to their own net? The Assyrian did this, because he thought that he surpassed all others in craftiness, because he thought himself so courageous as not to hesitate to make war with all nations, regarding himself well prepared with forces and justified in his proceedings; and 				because he became successful and omitted nothing calculated to ensure victory. Thus the Assyrian, as I have said, regarded as nothing his idols; for he put himself in the place of all the gods. But if it be asked whence came his success, we must answer, that the Assyrian ought to have ascribed it all to the one true God: but he thought that he prospered through his own velour. If we refer to counsel, it is certain that God is he who governs the counsels and minds of men; but the Assyrian 				thought that he gained everything by his own skill. If, again, we speak of strength, whence was it? and of courage, whence was it, but from God? but the Assyrian appropriated all these things to himself. What regard, then, had he for God? We see how he now takes away all honor even from his own idols, and attributes everything to himself.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xix-p8"></A>But this sin, as I have already said, belongs to all the ungodly; for where God&#8217;s Spirit does not reign, there is no humility, and men ever swell with inward pride, until God thoroughly cleanse them. It is then necessary that God should empty us by his special grace, that we may not be filled with this satanic pride, which is innate, and which cannot by any means be shaken off by us, until the Lord regenerates us by his Spirit. And this 				may be seen es specially in all the kings of this world. They indeed confess that kings rule through God&#8217;s grace; and then when they gain any victory, supplications are made, vows are paid. But were any one to say to those conquerors, &#8220;God had mercy on you,&#8221; the answer would be, &#8220;What! was then my preparation nothing? did I not provide many things beforehand? did I not attain the friendship of many? did I not form confederacies? did I not foresee such and such disadvantages? did I not 				opportunely provide a remedy?&#8221; In a word, they sacrifice apparently to God, but afterwards they have a regard mainly to their drag and their net, and make nothing of God. Well would it be were these things not so evident. But since the Spirit of God sets before us a lively image of the fact, let us learn what true humility is, and that we then only have this, when we think that we are nothing, and can do nothing, and that it is God alone who not only supports and continues us in life, but also 				governs us by his Spirit, and that it is he who sustains our hearts, gives courage, and then blesses us, so as to render prosperous what we may undertake. Let us hence learn that God cannot be really glorified, except when men wholly empty themselves.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ii.xix-p9"></A>He then adds, <i>because in </i>(<i>or by</i>) <i>them is his fat portion and his rich meat</i>. Though some render <a name="iii.ii.xix-p9.1"></A>&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, <i>berae</i>, 				<i>choice</i> meat, and others, <i>fat</i> meat, I yet prefer the meaning of rich.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>
 				 His meat then will be rich. The Prophet intimates here that men are so blinded by prosperity that they sacrifice to themselves, and hence the more deserving of reproof is their ingratitude; for the more liberally God deals with us the more reason, no doubt, there is why we ought to glorify him. But when men, well supplied and fully satisfied, thus swell with pride and sacrifice to themselves, is not their impiety in this manner more completely discovered? But the 				Prophet not only proves that the Assyrians abused God&#8217;s bounty, but he shows in their person what is the disposition of the whole world. For when men accumulate great wealth, and pile up a great heap from the property of others, they become more and more blinded. We hence see that we ought justly to fear the evil of prosperity, lest our fatness should so increase that we can see nothing; for the eyes are dimmed by excessive fatness. Let this then be ever remembered by us. The Prophet then 				concludes his discourse: but as one verse of the first chapter only remains, I shall briefly notice it.</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xx"></A>

<p><a name="iii.ii.xx-p7"></A>This is an affirmative question, &#8220;Shall they therefore;&#8221; which, however, requires a negative answer. Then all interpreters are mistaken; for they think that the Prophet here complains, that he presently extends his net after having made a capture, but he rather means, &#8220;Is he ever to extend his net?&#8221; that is, &#8220;How long, O Lord, wilt thou permit the Assyrians to proceed to new plunders, so as to be like the hunter, who after having taken a 				boar or a stag, is more eager, and immediately renews his hunting; or like the fisherman, who having filled his little ship, with more avidity pursues his vocation? Wilt thou, Lord, he says, suffer the Assyrians to become more assiduous in their work of destruction?&#8221; And he shows how unworthy they were of God&#8217;s forbearance, for they slew the nations. &#8220;I speak not here,&#8221; he says, &#8220;either of fish or of any other animal, nor do I speak of this or that man, but I speak of many nations. As these 				slaughters are thus carried on through the whole world, how long, Lord, shall they be unpunished? for they will never cease.&#8221; We now see the purport of the Prophet&#8217;s complaint; but we shall find in the next lecture how he recovers himself.</p>  <a name="iii.ii.xxi"></A>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.iii-p15"></A> Rather, a causative meaning; for so does <i>Calvin</i> take it; and <i>Junius </i>and <i>Tremelius, Piscator, Grotius, </i>and <i>Newcome, </i>agree with him: but <i>Drusius, Marckius, Henderson, </i>and others, consider it simply in the sense of seeing or beholding, and say with truth, that there is no other instance in which it has, though it be often found, as here, in Hiphil, a causative sense. The context, as <i>Calvin </i>says, seems 					 certainly to favor this meaning; and we might suppose that Habakkuk used it in a sense different from others, were it not that he uses it at least twice in this very chapter, verses 5 and 13, simply in the sense of seeing or beholding.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p16"></A>In these two verses there is no need of continuing the interrogatory form throughout, nor is this justified by the original. A strictly literal rendering, such as the following, would be the most appropriate:</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p17"></A><b>2.</b> How long, Jehovah, have I cried, and thou hearest not? I cry aloud to thee, "oppression,&#8221; and thou savest not:</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p18"></A><b>3.</b> Why showest thou to me iniquity? Yea, wickedness is what thou seest; Even wasting and oppression are before me; Then there is strife, and contention arises.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.iii-p19"></A>Some think that there is to be understood a preposition before [<a name="iii.ii.iii-p19.1"></A>&#1495;&#1502;&#1501;], which I render &#8220;oppression,&#8221; in the second line; but there is no need of it. The word means outrage, wrong forcibly done, violent injustice. [<a name="iii.ii.iii-p19.2"></A>&#1506;&#1502;&#1500;], wickedness, in the second line of the third verse, in its primary sense, is labor, toil; it means also what produces toil, mischief, wickedness. <i>Henderson </i>renders it misery; but it is not so suitable; for it must be something that corresponds with iniquity in the previous line. Wickedness is the word adopted by <i>Newcome</i>. [<a name="iii.ii.iii-p19.3"></A>&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;], strife, is a verbal contention or quarrel; and [<a name="iii.ii.iii-p19.4"></A>&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1494;] contention, is a judicial contest, or a trial by law. Then in the next verse we see how unjustly this trial was conducted. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.iv-p9"></A> <i>Calvin </i>omits to notice &#8220;therefore,&#8221; [<a name="iii.ii.iv-p9.1"></A>&#1506;&#1500;-&#1499;&#1494;], at the beginning of the verse. <i>Henderson</i> says, that the connection is with the second verse: but this can hardly be the case; and certainly what this verse contains is no 					 reason for what is stated in the previous verse. [<a name="iii.ii.iv-p9.2"></A>&#1500;&#1499;&#1494;], a similar proposition with this, when followed by [<a name="iii.ii.iv-p9.3"></A>&#1499;&#1497;], as the case is here, refers sometimes to what follows and not to what precedes. See <a name="iii.ii.iv-p9.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010">Ps. 16:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011">11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#021">Ps. 78:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#022">22</a><a name="iii.ii.iv-p9.4"></A>. The meaning of the verse will be elicited, as I can conceive, by the following version: &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iii.ii.iv-p10"></A><i>On this account the law fails, <br> 					 And judgment goeth not forth to victory, </i>&#8212;<i> <br> 					 Because wickedness surrounds the righteous; <br> 					 </i>Yea, <i>on this account perverted judgment goeth forth.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.iv-p11"></A>The expression, [<a name="iii.ii.iv-p11.1"></A>&#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;], is rendered &#8220;never&#8221; in our version, and by <i>Newcome;</i> but it never means this: &#8220;not for ever, or not always,&#8221; it is rendered in other places. See <a name="iii.ii.iv-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019">Ps. 9:19</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019">Ps. 74:19</a><a name="iii.ii.iv-p11.2"></A>. But [<a name="iii.ii.iv-p11.3"></A>&#1504;&#1510;&#1495;] means as a noun, superiority, excellency, strength, victory; and this, according to <i>Parkhurst</i>, is what it means here. It seems better to render [<a name="iii.ii.iv-p11.4"></A>&#1512;&#1513;&#1506;], 					 wickedness, than wicked. It means injustice, the perversion of right, and by this the just man was surrounded or completely beset, so that he had no chance of having justice done to him. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.v-p9"></A> This may perhaps be considered one of the <i>very few </i>instances in which the <i>Septuagint</i> seems to have retained the true reading without the countenance of a single MS.; for the word &#8220;despisers&#8221; is more suitable to the context. The very same word is found in the 13th verse of this chapter. The omission is very trifling, only of the 					 letter [<a name="iii.ii.v-p9.1"></A>&#1491;], and Paul in quoting this passage, in <a name="iii.ii.v-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041">Ac 13:41</a><a name="iii.ii.v-p9.2"></A>, retains this word, while in the other clauses he departs from the <i>Septuagint</i>, and comes nearer to the Hebrew text. <i>Pocock</i> 					 thought that [<a name="iii.ii.v-p9.3"></A>&#1489;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;] is a noun from the Arabic [<a name="iii.ii.v-p9.4"></A>&#1489;&#1490;&#1488;], which means to be unjust or injurious; and thus the Hebrew is made the same with the <i>Septuagint</i>, and St. Paul, &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;, 					 despisers &#8212; the insolent; but the former supposition seems the more probable &#8212; that the letter [<a name="iii.ii.v-p9.5"></A>&#1491;] has been omitted. <i>Dathius</i> renders the word &#8220;<a name="iii.ii.v-p9.6"></A><i>perfidi</i> &#8212; perfidious,&#8221; and <i>Newcome </i>&#8220;transgressors.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

Others, as <i>Newcome</i> and 					 <i>Drusius </i>render it, supping up, or absorption, and derive it from [<a name="iii.ii.xi-p8.2"></A>&#1490;&#1502;&#1488;], to drink up, to absorb; and they regard the idea to be, that the very presence of the Chaldeans would absorb every thing like a scorching wind. But &#8220;the supping up of their faces <i>shall</i> <i>be as 					 </i>the east wind,&#8221; which is <i>Newcome&#8217;s </i>version, is an odd phrase. The last word has [<a name="iii.ii.xi-p8.3"></A>&#1492;] affixed to it, which is never the case when it means the east wind. It is by all admitted, that &#8220;towards the east&#8221; is its proper construction. Hence the most probable rendering of this passage is, &#8220;The aspect of their faces shall 					 be towards the east;&#8221; and with this corresponds what follows, that they should &#8220;gather captives as the sand;&#8221; that is, that they might carry them away to the place where they turned their faces.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xi-p9"></A>The version of <i>Henderson</i>, which is essentially that of <i>Symmachus</i>, is the following, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.ii.xi-p10"></A>The aspect of their faces is like the east wind.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xi-p11"></A>He owns the difficulty as to the last word, and views it here as in an irregular form. <i>Dathius </i>gives this paraphrase, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.ii.xi-p12"></A>It will have its face direct towards the east.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xi-p13"></A>He says that the word [<a name="iii.ii.xi-p13.1"></A>&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;], by itself never means the pestilential wind from the east; but that when it means this, it has another word attached to it. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p12"></A> The foregoing verse is one on which no satisfactory explanation has been given. The one adopted here has been materially followed by <i>Vatablus, Druius, </i>and <i>Dathius</i>, except as to the last clause. As to the first part of the verse <i>Henderson </i>gives the best sense, for it 					 corresponds with &#8220;changing&#8221; to [<a name="iii.ii.xiii-p12.1"></A>&#1495;&#1500;&#1507;] and &#8220;courage&#8221; to [<a name="iii.ii.xiii-p12.2"></A>&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;], (see <a name="iii.ii.xiii-p12.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011">Josh. 2:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001">Josh. 5:1</a><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p12.3"></A>;) and of &#8220;passing onward&#8221; to [<a name="iii.ii.xiii-p12.4"></A>&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;], and not of &#8220;passing over,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i> bounds or moderation, which it seems not to have, when used, as here, intransitively. The passing here is evidently what is referred to in verse 6, as the renewing of courage would arise, from the success mentioned in verse 10.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p13"></A>The best exposition of the last clause is what <i>Grotius</i> has suggested, and has been followed by <i>Marckius</i> and <i>Dathius</i> &#8212; that the Chaldeans made their own strength their God; (see verse 16;) the rendering then would be this, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p14"></A><i>Then will it renew courage, And pass through, <br> 					 and become guilty; </i>&#8212;<i> This is strength being its god, <br> 					 </i>or literally, <i>This is strength for its god.</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiii-p15"></A>There is an inconsistency in our version, and also in <i>Calvin</i>, as to this passage, from verse 6 to the end of this verse. The number is changed. The &#8220;bitter nation,&#8221; mentioned in verse 6, is meant throughout; and we ought to adopt the plural number throughout, as <i>Newcome </i>does, or, according to <i>Henderson</i>, the singular. There is no change of person, as some suppose, at the beginning of verse 10; for [<a name="iii.ii.xiii-p15.1"></A>&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;], there, and [<a name="iii.ii.xiii-p15.2"></A>&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;] in verse 6 is the same &#8212; the &#8220;bitter nation.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_16"></A><A HREF="cc29004.htm#fr_16">17</A> <a name="iii.ii.xiv-p8.2"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.xiv-p9"></A> Most commentators agree with our version in connecting &#8220;from the beginning,&#8221; or &#8220;from eternity,&#8221; with Jehovah, and not as <i>Calvin </i>seems to do, with &#8220;God.&#8221; His view is evidently the most consonant with the design of the passage, and countenanced by the Septuagint, for Jehovah is rendered &#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#949;, in the vocative case. To assert 					 the eternity of God seems not to be necessary here; but to say that he had been from old times the God of Israel is what is suitable to the context. The Prophet in saying &#8220;my God,&#8221; identifies himself with the people; for he says afterwards, &#8220;we shall not die.&#8221; Viewed in this light the former part of the verse may be thus rendered, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.ii.xiv-p10"></A>Art not thou from of old, O Jehovah, <br> 					 my God! My holy one, we shall not die.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xiv-p11"></A>The reason for which he calls him &#8220;holy&#8221; will appear from what the next verse contains. The Prophet seems to sustain himself by two considerations &#8212; that Jehovah was the God of Israel, and that he was a holy God. When he says &#8220;we shall not die,&#8221; he means, no doubt, as <i>Marckius </i>observes, that the people as a nation would not be destroyed, for he had prophesied of their subjugation and captivity by the Chaldeans. What he had in view 					 was the Church of God, respecting which promises had been made. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p4"></A> It seems that <i>Calvin</i> regarded &#8220;my holy one,&#8221; as equivalent to &#8220;my sanctifier;&#8221; he who had separated the people from others to be his own. The primary meaning of [<a name="iii.ii.xvi-p4.1"></A>&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;] is no doubt to separate a thing from a common use to a sacred one; but whether in this connection it 					 has this meaning is not quite certain. &#8220;The holy one of Israel&#8221; is a phrase several times used by Isaiah, see <a name="iii.ii.xvi-p4.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#011">Isa. 30:11</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003">Isa. 43:3</a><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p4.2"></A>, etc. The sentence here may be rendered, &#8220;God of my holiness,&#8221; or &#8220;My God, my holiness.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_18"></A><A HREF="cc29004.htm#fr_18">19</A> <a name="iii.ii.xvi-p7.4"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p8"></A> Many agree in this view, <i>Drusius, Piscator, Marckius, Henderson, </i>etc. The Septuagint affords no help. The rendering of <i>Symmachus </i>is &#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;, strong, and of <i>Aquila</i>, &#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#959;&#957;, 					 firm; then it would be, &#8220;and strong (or firm) for correction hast thou established him.&#8221; <i>Grotius</i>, and also <i>Newcome</i>, adopt this meaning.</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p9"></A><i>And thous hast founded them on a rock to chasten </i>us</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p10"></A>This is, no doubt, the easiest and most natural construction. See <a name="iii.ii.xvi-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009">Eze 3:9</a><a name="iii.ii.xvi-p10.1"></A>. God rendered the Chaldean nation firm, and strong, and resolute, to punish the Jews. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_19"></A><A HREF="cc29004.htm#fr_19">20</A> <a name="iii.ii.xvii-p7.2"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p8"></A> Adjectives and participles in Hebrew commonly take a plural form, but not always, as evidently in the present case; for the word for &#8220;pure,&#8221; though singular, will admit of a better construction with &#8220;eyes&#8221; than in any other way; and so <i>Grotius </i>renders the clause, &#8220;Purer are thine eyes,&#8221; etc.; which is better than our version, followed by <i>Newcome </i>and <i>Henderson</i>. The whole passage will thus read better: &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent04"><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p9"></A><i>Purer </i>are thine <i>eyes than to behold evil, <br> 					 And to look on wickedness thou art not able: <br> 					 Why </i>then<i> lookest thou on the perfidious, <br> 					 </i>And <i>art still when the wicked swallows up <br> 					 One more righteous than himself? <br> 					 And makest man to be like the fish of the sea, <br> 					 Like the reptile which has no ruler?</i></p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p10"></A>&#8220;Evil&#8221; means here wrong, injustice; the corresponding clause is &#8220;the wicked&#8221; swallowing up or oppressing his better. The Jews were bad, but better than the Chaldeans. &#8220;Wickedness,&#8221; [<a name="iii.ii.xvii-p10.1"></A>&#1506;&#1502;&#1500;], is such a mischief as is done through treachery: hence in the next line, which, according to the style of the Prophets, 					 corresponds with this, &#8220;the perfidious&#8221; are mentioned, improperly rendered &#8220;plunderers&#8221; by <i>Henderson</i>, and &#8220;transgressors&#8221; by <i>Newcome</i>. The Chaldeans had been the allies of the Jews.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xvii-p11"></A>With respect to the reptile or the crawling fish, such as keep to the bottom of the waters, why is it said to be without a ruler? Is it more insulated and less gregarious, so to speak, than other fish? If so, &#8220;without a ruler&#8221; has an obvious meaning. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_20"></A><A HREF="cc29004.htm#fr_20">21</A> <a name="iii.ii.xviii-p8.1"></A>   				  
<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p9"></A> The construction of this verse can only be understood by a reference to the preceeding verse; where two things are mentioned, the fish of the sea and the reptile: as it is customary with the Prophets, the first clause was rasied up by a hook, and the fish were enclosed in a net, or collected by a drag. The reptile, [<a name="iii.ii.xviii-p9.1"></A>&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;], is in the singular number, and used in a collective sense, and [<a name="iii.ii.xviii-p9.2"></A>&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;], every one, at the beginning of this verse, is in the same number. This entirely removes the difficulty which critics have felt, and made them to propose emendations. The verse then would read thus: &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent05"><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p10"></A>Every one (i.e. every reptile) by a hook he raises up <br> 					 He draws them out (i.e. the fish) by his net, <br> 					 And collects them by his drag; <br> 					 He therefore rejoices, and exults.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p11"></A>To &#8220;gather then <i>into</i> the net&#8221; can hardly be sense; nor is &#8220;<i>in</i> the net&#8221; much better. The drawing out and the collecting were evidently <i>by</i> the net and the drag; the preposition, [<a name="iii.ii.xviii-p11.1"></A>&#1489;], has very commonly this meaning, as &#7952;&#957; in Greek.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xviii-p12"></A>The representation here is, that every means would be employed: men being compared to fishes, some are set forth as creeping along the bottom, and others as swimming at large at all depths; and then the fisherman, the Chaldean comes, and draws out the first by a fishing-hook, and the rest by a net and a ddrag; so that he takes them all. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.xix-p10"></A> &#8220;His fat portion and rich meat&#8221; were the people whom he conquered. The words verbatim are these, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p class="Center"><a name="iii.ii.xix-p11"></A>For through them abundant his portion, <br> 					 And his meat well-fed.</p>  				  
<p><a name="iii.ii.xix-p12"></A>The comparison of the drag and net is continued; by which is signified military strength and power. See <a name="iii.ii.xix-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013">Isa 10:13</a><a name="iii.ii.xix-p12.1"></A>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="iii.ii.xx-p4"></A> The verb is [<a name="iii.ii.xx-p4.1"></A>&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;], a hiphil form, and means, to evacuate, to empty, to empty out, and this is the sense in which it is taken here by <i>Drusius</i>, <i>Marckius</i>, <i>Newcome</i>, and 						  <i>Henderson</i>. But the verb means also to draw out, <i>i.e.,</i> a sword, <a name="iii.ii.xx-p4.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#009">Ex 15:9</a><a name="iii.ii.xx-p4.2"></A>, <a name="iii.ii.xx-p4.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033">Le 26:33</a><a name="iii.ii.xx-p4.3"></A>, and to draw forth, <i>i.e.,</i> an 						  army, <a name="iii.ii.xx-p4.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014">Ge 14:14</a><a name="iii.ii.xx-p4.4"></A>, and this is the meaning given to it by <i>Grotius, Junius,</i> and the Septuagint. To draw forth, to extend, or to expand, seems most in accordance with the drift of the passage. To empty his net, and that for the sake of filling it again, which must be what is implied, is rather a farfetched notion. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 					 </P>
