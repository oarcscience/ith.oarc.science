<p><a name="iii.xxxix-p1"></A>This, however, does not prevent us from praying specially for  ourselves, and certain others, provided our mind is not withdrawn from the view  of this community, does not deviate from it, but constantly refers to it. For  prayers, though couched in special terms, keeping that object still in view,  cease not to be common. All this may easily be understood by analogy. There is a  general command from God to relieve the necessities of all the poor, and yet  this command is obeyed by those who with that view give succour to all whom they  see or know to be in distress, although they pass by many whose wants are not  less urgent, either because they cannot know or are unable to give supply to  all. In this way there is nothing repugnant to the will of God in those who,  giving heed to this common society of the Church, yet offer up particular  prayers, in which, with a public mind, though in special terms, they commend to  God themselves or others, with whose necessity he has been pleased to make them  more familiarly acquainted.</p> 
<p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xxxix-p2"></A>It is true that prayer and the giving of our substance are not in all  respects alike. We can only bestow the kindness of our liberality on those of  whose wants we are aware, whereas in prayer we can assist the greatest  strangers, how wide soever the space which may separate them from us. This is  done by that general form of prayer which, including all the sons of God,  includes them also. To this we may refer the exhortation which Paul gave to the  believers of his age, to lift up "holy hands without wrath and doubting"  (<a name="iii.xxxix-p2.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008">1 Timothy 2:8</a><a name="iii.xxxix-p2.1"></A>). By reminding them that dissension is a bar to prayer, he shows it to be  his wish that they should with one accord present their prayers in common.</p>
