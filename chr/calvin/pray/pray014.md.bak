#### <span id="iii.xii-p0.1"></span>12.

<span id="iii.xii-p1"></span>This necessity our opponents do not at all
consider. Therefore, when we say that believers ought to feel firmly
assured, they think we are saying the absurdest thing in the world. But
if they had any experience in true prayer, they would assuredly
understand that God cannot be duly invoked without this firm sense of
the Divine benevolence. But as no man can well perceive the power of
faith, without at the same time feeling it in his heart, what profit is
there in disputing with men of this character, who plainly show that
they have never had more than a vain imagination? The value and
necessity of that assurance for which we contend is learned chiefly from
prayer. Every one who does not see this gives proof of a very stupid
conscience. Therefore, leaving those who are thus blinded, let us fix
our thoughts on the words of Paul, that God can only be invoked by such
as have obtained a knowledge of his mercy from the Gospel, and feel
firmly assured that that mercy is ready to be bestowed upon them. What
kind of prayer would this be? "O Lord, I am indeed doubtful whether or
not thou art inclined to hear me; but being oppressed with anxiety I fly
to thee that if I am worthy, thou mayest assist me." None of the saints
whose prayers are given in Scripture thus supplicated. Nor are we thus
taught by the Holy Spirit, who tells us to "come boldly unto the throne
of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of
need" (<span id="iii.xii-p1.1"></span>[Hebrews
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016)<span id="iii.xii-p1.1"></span>.md);
and elsewhere teaches us to "have boldness and access with confidence by
the faith of Christ" (<span id="iii.xii-p1.2"></span>[Ephesians
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012)<span id="iii.xii-p1.2"></span>.md).
This confidence of obtaining what we ask, a confidence which the Lord
commands, and all the saints teach by their example, we must therefore
hold fast with both hands, if we would pray to any advantage. The only
prayer acceptable to God is that which springs (if I may so express it)
from this presumption of faith, and is founded on the full assurance of
hope. He might have been contented to use the simple name of faith, but
he adds not only confidence, but liberty or boldness, that by this mark
he might distinguish us from unbelievers, who indeed like us pray to
God, but pray at random. Hence, the whole Church thus prays "Let thy
mercy O Lord, be upon us, according as we hope in thee" (<span
id="iii.xii-p1.3"></span>[Psalm
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#022)<span id="iii.xii-p1.3"></span>.md).
The same condition is set down by the Psalmist in another passage, "When
I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know, for God
is for me" (<span id="iii.xii-p1.4"></span>[Psalm
56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009)<span id="iii.xii-p1.4"></span>.md).
Again, "In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look
up" (<span id="iii.xii-p1.5"></span>[Psalm
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003)<span id="iii.xii-p1.5"></span>.md).
From these words we gather, that prayers are vainly poured out into the
air unless accompanied with faith, in which, as from a watchtower, we
may quietly wait for God. With this agrees the order of Paul's
exhortation. For before urging believers to pray in the Spirit always,
with vigilance and assiduity, he enjoins them to take "the shield of
faith," " the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is
the word of God" (<span id="iii.xii-p1.6"></span>[Ephesians
6:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.xii-p1.6"></span>).

<span id="iii.xii-p2"></span>Let the reader here call to mind what I
formerly observed, that faith by no means fails though accompanied with
a recognition of our wretchedness, poverty, and pollution. How much
soever believers may feel that they are oppressed by a heavy load of
iniquity, and are not only devoid of everything which can procure the
favour of God for them, but justly burdened with many sins which make
him an object of dread, yet they cease not to present themselves, this
feeling not deterring them from appearing in his presence, because there
is no other access to him. Genuine prayer is not that by which we
arrogantly extol ourselves before God, or set a great value on anything
of our own, but that by which, while confessing our guilt, we utter our
sorrows before God, just as children familiarly lay their complaints
before their parents. Nay, the immense accumulation of our sins should
rather spur us on and incite us to prayer. Of this the Psalmist gives us
an example, "Heal my soul: for I have sinned against thee" (<span
id="iii.xii-p2.1"></span>[Psalm
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004)<span id="iii.xii-p2.1"></span>.md).
I confess, indeed, that these stings would prove mortal darts, did not
God give succour; but our heavenly Father has, in ineffable kindness,
added a remedy, by which, calming all perturbation, soothing our cares,
and dispelling our fears he condescendingly allures us to himself; nay,
removing all doubts, not to say obstacles, makes the way smooth before
us.
