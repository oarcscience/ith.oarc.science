<span id="iii.xxx-p1"></span>As God in his word enjoins common prayer,
so public temples are the places destined for the performance of them,
and hence those who refuse to join with the people of God in this
observance have no ground for the pretext, that they enter their chamber
in order that they may obey the command of the Lord. For he who promises
to grant whatsoever two or three assembled in his name shall ask (<span
id="iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>[Matthew
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020)<span id="iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>),
declares, that he by no means despises the prayers which are publicly
offered up, provided there be no ostentation, or catching at human
applause, and provided there be a true and sincere affection in the
secret recesses of the heart. <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15) If
this is the legitimate use of churches (and it certainly is), we must,
on the other hand, beware of imitating the practice which commenced some
centuries ago, of imagining that churches are the proper dwellings of
God, where he is more ready to listen to us, or of attaching to them
some kind of secret sanctity, which makes prayer there more holy. For
seeing we are the true temples of God, we must pray in ourselves if we
would invoke God in his holy temple. Let us leave such gross ideas to
the Jews or the heathen, knowing that we have a command to pray without
distinction of place, "in spirit and in truth" (<span
id="iii.xxx-p1.3"></span>[John
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023)<span id="iii.xxx-p1.3"></span>).
It is true that by the order of God the temple was anciently dedicated
for the offering of prayers and sacrifices, but this was at a time when
the truth (which being now fully manifested, we are not permitted to
confine to any material temple) lay hid under the figure of shadows.
Even the temple was not represented to the Jews as confining the
presence of God within its walls, but was meant to train them to
contemplate the image of the true temple. Accordingly, a severe rebuke
is administered both by Isaiah and Stephen, to those who thought that
God could in any way dwell in temples made with hands (<span
id="iii.xxx-p1.4"></span>[Isaiah
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002)<span id="iii.xxx-p1.4"></span>;
<span id="iii.xxx-p1.5"></span>[Acts
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048)<span id="iii.xxx-p1.5"></span>).
