*Of Prayer*, by John Calvin, tr. Henry Beveridge \[1845\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

#### <span id="iii.vii-p0.1"></span>7.

<span id="iii.vii-p1"></span>If it is objected, that the necessity which
urges us to pray is not always equal, I admit it, and this distinction
is profitably taught us by James: " Is any among you afflicted? let him
pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms" (<span
id="iii.vii-p1.1"></span>[James
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013)<span id="iii.vii-p1.1"></span>.md).
Therefore, common sense itself dictates, that as we are too sluggish, we
must be stimulated by God to pray earnestly whenever the occasion
requires. This David calls a time when God "may be found" (a seasonable
time); because, as he declares in several other passages, that the more
hardly grievances, annoyances, fears, and other kinds of trial press us,
the freer is our access to God, as if he were inviting us to himself.
Still not less true is the injunction of Paul to pray "always" (<span
id="iii.vii-p1.2"></span>[Ephesians
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018)<span id="iii.vii-p1.2"></span>.md);
because, however prosperously according to our view, things proceed, and
however we may be surrounded on all sides with grounds of joy, there is
not an instant of time during which our want does not exhort us to
prayer. A man abounds in wheat and wine; but as he cannot enjoy a morsel
of bread, unless by the continual bounty of God, his granaries or
cellars will not prevent him from asking for daily bread. Then, if we
consider how many dangers impend every moment, fear itself will teach us
that no time ought to be without prayer. This, however, may be better
known in spiritual matters. For when will the many sins of which we are
conscious allow us to sit secure without suppliantly entreating freedom
from guilt and punishment? When will temptation give us a truce, making
it unnecessary to hasten for help? Moreover, zeal for the kingdom and
glory of God ought not to seize us by starts, but urge us without
intermission, so that every time should appear seasonable. It is not
without cause, therefore, that assiduity in prayer is so often enjoined.
I am not now speaking of perseverance, which shall afterwards be
considered; but Scripture, by reminding us of the necessity of constant
prayer, charges us with sloth, because we feel not how much we stand in
need of this care and assiduity. By this rule hypocrisy and the device
of lying to God are restrained, nay, altogether banished from prayer.
God promises that he will be near to those who call upon him in truth,
and declares that those who seek him with their whole heart will find
him: those, therefore, who delight in their own pollution cannot surely
aspire to him.

<span id="iii.vii-p2"></span>One of the requisites of legitimate prayer
is repentance. Hence the common declaration of Scripture, that God does
not listen to the wicked; that their prayers, as well as their
sacrifices, are an abomination to him. For it is right that those who
seal up their hearts should find the ears of God closed against them,
that those who, by their hardheartedness, provoke his severity should
find him inflexible. In Isaiah he thus threatens: "When ye make many
prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood" (<span
id="iii.vii-p2.1"></span>[Isaiah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)<span id="iii.vii-p2.1"></span>.md).
In like manner, in Jeremiah, "Though they shall cry unto me, I will not
hearken unto them" (<span id="iii.vii-p2.2"></span>[Jer.
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.vii-p2.2"></span><span id="iii.vii-p2.3"></span>[Jer.
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#008.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#011)<span id="iii.vii-p2.3"></span>.md);
because he regards it as the highest insult for the wicked to boast of
his covenant while profaning his sacred name by their whole lives. Hence
he complains in Isaiah: "This people draw near to me with their mouth,
and with their lips do honour me; but have removed their heart far from
men" (<span id="iii.vii-p2.4"></span>[Isaiah
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013)<span id="iii.vii-p2.4"></span>.md).
Indeed, he does not confine this to prayers alone, but declares that he
abominates pretense in every part of his service. Hence the words of
James, "Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may
consume it upon your lusts" (<span id="iii.vii-p2.5"></span>[James
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003)<span id="iii.vii-p2.5"></span>.md).
It is true, indeed (as we shall again see in a little), that the pious,
in the prayers which they utter, trust not to their own worth; still the
admonition of John is not superfluous: "Whatsoever we ask, we receive of
him, because we keep his commandments" (<span
id="iii.vii-p2.6"></span>[1 John
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022)<span id="iii.vii-p2.6"></span>.md);
an evil conscience shuts the door against us. Hence it follows, that
none but the sincere worshippers of God pray aright, or are listened to.
Let every one, therefore, who prepares to pray feel dissatisfied with
what is wrong in his condition, and assume, which he cannot do without
repentance, the character and feelings of a poor suppliant.
