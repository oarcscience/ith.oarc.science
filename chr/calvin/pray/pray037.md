*Of Prayer*, by John Calvin, tr. Henry Beveridge \[1845\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

#### <span id="iii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>35.

<span id="iii.xxxv-p1"></span>This form or rule of prayer is composed of
*six petitions*. For I am prevented from agreeing with those who divide
it into *seven* by the adversative mode of diction used by the
Evangelist, who appears to have intended to unite the two members
together; as if he had said, Do not allow us to be overcome by
temptation, but rather bring assistance to our frailty, and deliver us
that we may not fall. Ancient writers <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) also agree with us, that what is added by
Matthew as a seventh head is to be considered as explanatory of the
sixth petition. <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) But though in every
part of the prayer the first place is assigned to the glory of God,
still this is more especially the object of the three first petitions,
in which we are to look to the glory of God alone, without any reference
to what is called our own advantage. The three remaining petitions are
devoted to our interest, and properly relate to things which it is
useful for us to ask. When we ask that the name of God may be hallowed,
as God wishes to prove whether we love and serve him freely, or from the
hope of reward, we are not to think at all of our own interest; we must
set his glory before our eyes, and keep them intent upon it alone. In
the other similar petitions, this is the only manner in which we ought
to be affected. It is true, that in this way our own interest is greatly
promoted, because, when the name of God is hallowed in the way we ask,
our own sanctification also is thereby promoted. But in regard to this
advantage, we must, as I have said, shut our eyes, and be in a manner
blind, so as not even to see it; and hence were all hope of our private
advantage cut off, we still should never cease to wish and pray for this
hallowing, and everything else which pertains to the glory of God. We
have examples in Moses and Paul, who did not count it grievous to turn
away their eyes and minds from themselves, and with intense and fervent
zeal long for death, if by their loss the kingdom and glory of God might
be promoted (<span id="iii.xxxv-p1.4"></span>[Exodus
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md)<span id="iii.xxxv-p1.4"></span>;
<span id="iii.xxxv-p1.5"></span>[Romans
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003)<span id="iii.xxxv-p1.5"></span>.md).
On the other hand, when we ask for daily bread, although we desire what
is advantageous for ourselves, we ought also especially to seek the
glory of God, so much so that we would not ask at all unless it were to
turn to his glory. Let us now proceed to an exposition of the Prayer.

<span id="iii.xxxv-p2"></span>

<span id="iii.xxxv-p3"></span>OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN.

facile de juger que ce qui est adjousté en S. Matthieu, et qu’aucuns ont
pris pour une septieme requeste, n’est qu’un explication de la sixieme,
et se doit a icelle rapporter;"—Whence it is easy to perceive that what
is added in St Matthew, and which some have taken for a seventh
petition, is only an explanation of the sixth, and ought to be referred
to it.
