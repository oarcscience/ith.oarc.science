#### <span id="iii.xix-p0.1"></span>19.

<span id="iii.xix-p1"></span>Moreover since he himself is the only way
and the only access by which we can draw near to God, those who deviate
from this way, and decline this access, have no other remaining; his
throne presents nothing but wrath, judgment, and terror. In short, as
the Father has consecrated him our guide and head, those who abandon or
turn aside from him in any way endeavour, as much as in them lies, to
sully and efface the stamp which God has impressed. Christ, therefore,
is the only Mediator by whose intercession the Father is rendered
propitious and exorable (<span id="iii.xix-p1.1"></span>[1 Timothy
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)<span id="iii.xix-p1.1"></span>.md).
For though the saints are still permitted to use intercessions, by which
they mutually beseech God in behalf of each other's salvation, and of
which the Apostle makes mention (<span id="iii.xix-p1.2"></span>[Eph.
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md)<span id="iii.xix-p1.2"></span>;
<span id="iii.xix-p1.3"></span>[1 Timothy
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001)<span id="iii.xix-p1.3"></span>.md);
yet these depend on that one intercession, so far are they from
derogating from it. For as the intercessions which, as members of one
body we offer up for each other, spring from the feeling of love, so
they have reference to this one head. Being thus also made in the name
of Christ, what more do they than declare that no man can derive the
least benefit from any prayers without the intercession of Christ? As
there is nothing in the intercession of Christ to prevent the different
members of the Church from offering up prayers for each other, so let it
be held as a fixed principle, that all the intercessions thus used in
the Church must have reference to that one intercession. Nay, we must be
specially careful to show our gratitude on this very account, that God
pardoning our unworthiness, not only allows each individual to pray for
himself, but allows all to intercede mutually for each other. God having
given a place in his Church to intercessors who would deserve to be
rejected when praying privately on their own account, how presumptuous
were it to abuse this kindness by employing it to obscure the honour of
Christ?
