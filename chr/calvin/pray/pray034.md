<span id="iii.xxxii-p1"></span>It is certain that the use of singing in
churches (which I may mention in passing) is not only very ancient, but
was also used by the Apostles, as we may gather from the words of Paul,
"I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding
also" (<span id="iii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015)<span
id="iii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>). In like manner he says to the Colossians,
"Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and
spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord" (<span
id="iii.xxxii-p1.2"></span>[Colossians
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#016)<span
id="iii.xxxii-p1.2"></span>). In the former passage, he enjoins us to
sing with the voice and the heart; in the latter, he commends spiritual
Songs, by which the pious mutually edify each other. That it was not an
universal practice, however, is attested by Augustine (Confess. Lib. ix.
cap. 7), who states that the church of Milan first began to use singing
in the time of Ambrose, when the orthodox faith being persecuted by
Justina, the mother of Valentinian, the vigils of the people were more
frequent than usual; <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16) and that the
practice was afterwards followed by the other Western churches. He had
said a little before that the custom came from the East. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17) He also intimates (Retract. Lib. ii).
that it was received in Africa in his own time. His words are,
"Hilarius, a man of tribunitial rank, assailed with the bitterest
invectives he could use the custom which then began to exist at
Carthage, of singing hymns from the book of Psalms at the altar, either
before the oblation, or when it was distributed to the people; I
answered him, at the request of my brethren." <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18) And certainly if singing is tempered to a
gravity befitting the presence of God and angels, it both gives dignity
and grace to sacred actions, and has a very powerful tendency to stir up
the mind to true zeal and ardour in prayer. We must, however, carefully
beware, lest our ears be more intent on the music than our minds on the
spiritual meaning of the words. Augustine confesses (Confess. Lib. x.
cap. 33) that the fear of this danger sometimes made him wish for the
introduction of a practice observed by Athanasius, who ordered the
reader to use only a gentle inflection of the voice, more akin to
recitation than singing. But on again considering how many advantages
were derived from singing, he inclined to the other side. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19) If this moderation is used, there cannot
be a doubt that the practice is most sacred and salutary. On the other
hand, songs composed merely to tickle and delight the ear are unbecoming
the majesty of the Church, and cannot but be most displeasing to God.

se souvenoit du fruict et de l’edification qu’il avoit recue en oyant
chanter àl’Eglise il enclinoit plus à l’autre partie, c’est, approuver
le chant;"—but he adds on the other hand that when he called to mind the
fruit and edification which he had received from hearing singing in the
church, he inclined more to the other side; that is, to approve singing.
