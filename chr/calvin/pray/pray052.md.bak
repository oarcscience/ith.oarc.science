<span id="iii.l-p1"></span>But although it has been said above (sec. 7,
27, &c.), that we ought always to raise our minds upwards towards God,
and pray without ceasing, yet such is our weakness, which requires to be
supported, such our torpor, which requires to be stimulated, that it is
requisite for us to appoint special hours for this exercise, hours which
are not to pass away without prayer, and during which the whole
affections of our minds are to be completely occupied; namely, when we
rise in the morning, before we commence our daily work, when we sit down
to food, when by the blessing of God we have taken it, and when we
retire to rest. This, however, must not be a superstitious observance of
hours, by which, as it were, performing a task to God, we think we are
discharged as to other hours; it should rather be considered as a
discipline by which our weakness is exercised, and ever and anon
stimulated. In particular, it must be our anxious care, whenever we are
ourselves pressed, or see others pressed by any strait, instantly to
have recourse to him not only with quickened pace, but with quickened
minds; and again, we must not in any prosperity of ourselves or others
omit to testify our recognition of his hand by praise and thanksgiving.
Lastly, we must in all our prayers carefully avoid wishing to confine
God to certain circumstances, or prescribe to him the time, place, or
mode of action. In like manner, we are taught by this prayer not to fix
any law or impose any condition upon him, but leave it entirely to him
to adopt whatever course of procedure seems to him best, in respect of
method, time, and place. For before we offer up any petition for
ourselves, we ask that his will may be done, and by so doing place our
will in subordination to his, just as if we had laid a curb upon it,
that, instead of presuming to give law to God, it may regard him as the
ruler and disposer of all its wishes.
