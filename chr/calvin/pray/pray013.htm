<p><a name="iii.xi-p1"></A>The fourth rule of prayer is, that notwithstanding of our being  thus abased and truly humbled, we should be animated to pray with the sure hope  of succeeding. There is, indeed, an appearance of contradiction between the two  things, between a sense of the just vengeance of God and firm confidence in his  favour, and yet they are perfectly accordant, if it is the mere goodness of God  that raises up those who are overwhelmed by their own sins. For, as we have  formerly shown (chap. iii. sec. 1, 2) that repentance and faith go hand in hand,  being united by an indissoluble tie, the one causing terror, the other joy, so  in prayer they must both be present. This concurrence David expresses in a few  words: "But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy,  and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple" (<a name="iii.xi-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007">Psalm 5:7</a><a name="iii.xi-p1.1"></A>). Under the  goodness of God he comprehends faith, at the same time not excluding fear; for  not only does his majesty compel our reverence, but our own unworthiness also  divests us of all pride and confidence, and keeps us in fear. The confidence of  which I speak is not one which frees the mind from all anxiety, and soothes it  with sweet and perfect rest; such rest is peculiar to those who, while all their  affairs are flowing to a wish are annoyed by no care, stung with no regret,  agitated by no fear. But the best stimulus which the saints have to prayer is  when, in consequence of their own necessities, they feel the greatest  disquietude, and are all but driven to despair, until faith seasonably comes to  their aid; because in such straits the goodness of God so shines upon them, that  while they groan, burdened by the weight of present calamities, and tormented  with the fear of greater, they yet trust to this goodness, and in this way both  lighten the difficulty of endurance, and take comfort in the hope of final  deliverance. It is necessary therefore, that the prayer of the believer should  be the result of both feelings, and exhibit the influence of both; namely, that  while he groans under present and anxiously dreads new evils, he should, at the  same times have recourse to God, not at all doubting that God is ready to  stretch out a helping hand to him. For it is not easy to say how much God is  irritated by our distrust, when we ask what we expect not of his goodness.  Hence, nothing is more accordant to the nature of prayer than to lay it down as  a fixed rule, that it is not to come forth at random, but is to follow in the  footsteps of faith. To this principle Christ directs all of us in these words,  " Therefore, I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe  that ye receive them, and ye shall have them" (<a name="iii.xi-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#024">Mark 11:24</a><a name="iii.xi-p1.2"></A>). The same thing he  declares in another passage, "All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,  believing, ye shall receive" (<a name="iii.xi-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#022">Matthew 21:22</a><a name="iii.xi-p1.3"></A>). In accordance with this are the  words of James, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to  all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him. But let him  ask in faith, nothing wavering" (<a name="iii.xi-p1.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005">James 1:5</a><a name="iii.xi-p1.4"></A>). He most aptly expresses the power  of faith by opposing it to wavering. No less worthy of notice is his additional  statement, that those who approach God with a doubting, hesitating mind, without  feeling assured whether they are to be heard or not, gain nothing by their  prayers. Such persons he compares to a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and  tossed. Hence, in another passage he terms genuine prayer "the prayer of faith"  (<a name="iii.xi-p1.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015">James 5:15</a><a name="iii.xi-p1.5"></A>). Again, since God so often declares that he will give to every man  according to his faith he intimates that we cannot obtain anything without  faith. In short, it is faith which obtains everything that is granted to prayer.  This is the meaning of Paul in the well known passage to which dull men give too  little heed, "How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed?  and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" "So then faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" (<a name="iii.xi-p1.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014">Rom. 10:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017">17</a><a name="iii.xi-p1.6"></A>). Gradually  deducing the origin of prayer from faith, he distinctly maintains that God  cannot be invoked sincerely except by those to whom, by the preaching of the  Gospel, his mercy and willingness have been made known, nay, familiarly  explained.</p>
