<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Of Prayer</I>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <a name="iii.xxxviii"></A> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxxviii-p0.1"></A>38. </h4> 
<p><a name="iii.xxxviii-p1"></A>The instruction given us, however, is not that every individual in  particular is to call him Father, but rather that we are all in common to call  him Our Father. By this we are reminded how strong the feeling of brotherly love  between us ought to be, since we are all alike, by the same mercy and free  kindness, the children of such a Father. For if He from whom we all obtain  whatever is good is our common Father (<a name="iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009">Matthew 23:9</a><a name="iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></A>), everything which has been  distributed to us we should be prepared to communicate to each other, as far as  occasion demands. But if we are thus desirous as we ought, to stretch out our  hands and give assistance to each other, there is nothing by which we can more  benefit our brethren than by committing them to the care and protection of the  best of parents, since if He is propitious and favourable nothing more can be  desired. And, indeed, we owe this also to our Father. For as he who truly and  from the heart loves the father of a family, extends the same love and good-will  to all his household, so the zeal and affection which we feel for our heavenly  Parent it becomes us to extend towards his people, his family, and, in fine, his heritage, which he has honoured so highly as to give them the appellation of the  " fulness" of his only begotten Son (<a name="iii.xxxviii-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023">Ephesians 1:23</a><a name="iii.xxxviii-p1.2"></A>). Let the Christian, then, so  regulate his prayers as to make them common, and embrace all who are his  brethren in Christ; not only those whom at present he sees and knows to be such,  but all men who are alive upon the earth. What God has determined with regard to  them is beyond our knowledge, but to wish and hope the best concerning them is  both pious and humane. Still it becomes us to regard with special affection  those who are of the household of faith, and whom the Apostle has in express  terms recommended to our care in everything (<a name="iii.xxxviii-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010">Galatians 6:10</a><a name="iii.xxxviii-p1.3"></A>). In short, all our  prayers ought to bear reference to that community which our Lord has established  in his kingdom and family.</p>
