<p><a name="iii.lii-p1"></A>But if our sense is not able till after long expectation to  perceive what the result of prayer is, or experience any benefit from it, still  our faith will assure us of that which cannot be perceived by sense, viz., that  we have obtained what was fit for us, the Lord having so often and so surely  engaged to take an interest in all our troubles from the moment they have been  deposited in his bosom. In this way we shall possess abundance in poverty, and  comfort in affliction. For though all things fail, God will never abandon us,  and he cannot frustrate the expectation and patience of his people. He alone  will suffice for all, since in himself he comprehends all good, and will at last  reveal it to us on the day of judgment, when his kingdom shall be plainly  manifested. We may add, that although God complies with our request, he does not  always give an answer in the very terms of our prayers but while apparently  holding us in suspense, yet in an unknown way, shows that our prayers have not  been in vain. This is the meaning of the words of John, "If we know that he hear  us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of  him" (<a name="iii.lii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#015">1 John 5:15</a><a name="iii.lii-p1.1"></A>). It might seem that there is here a great superfluity of  words, but the declaration is most useful, namely, that God, even when he does  not comply with our requests, yet listens and is favourable to our prayers, so  that our hope founded on his word is never disappointed. But believers have  always need of being supported by this patience, as they could not stand long if  they did not lean upon it. For the trials by which the Lord proves and exercises  us are severe, nay, he often drives us to extremes, and when driven allows us  long to stick fast in the mire before he gives us any taste of his sweetness. As  Hannah says, "The Lord killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to the grave,  and bringeth up" (<a name="iii.lii-p1.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#006">1 Samuel 2:6</a><a name="iii.lii-p1.2"></A>). What could they here do but become dispirited and  rush on despair, were they not, when afflicted, desolate, and half dead,  comforted with the thought that they are regarded by God, and that there will be  an end to their present evils. But however secure their hopes may stand, they in  the meantime cease not to pray, since prayer unaccompanied by perseverance leads  to no result.</p>
