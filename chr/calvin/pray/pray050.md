*Of Prayer*, by John Calvin, tr. Henry Beveridge \[1845\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

#### <span id="iii.xlviii-p0.1"></span>48.

<span id="iii.xlviii-p1"></span>All things that we ought, indeed all
that we are able, to ask of God, are contained in this formula, and as
it were rule, of prayer delivered by Christ, our divine Master, whom the
Father has appointed to be our teacher, and to whom alone he would have
us to listen (<span id="iii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>[Matthew
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>). For he ever was the eternal wisdom of the
Father, and being made man, was manifested as the Wonderful, the
Counsellor (<span id="iii.xlviii-p1.2"></span>[Isaiah
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.xlviii-p1.2"></span>; <span id="iii.xlviii-p1.3"></span>[Isaiah
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.xlviii-p1.3"></span>). Accordingly, this prayer is complete in
all its parts, so complete, that whatever is extraneous and foreign to
it, whatever cannot be referred to it, is impious and unworthy of the
approbation of God. For he has here summarily prescribed what is worthy
of him, what is acceptable to him, and what is necessary for us; in
short, whatever he is pleased to grant. Those, therefore, who presume to
go further and ask something more from God, first seek to add of their
own to the wisdom of God (this it is insane blasphemy to do); secondly,
refusing to confine themselves within the will of God, and despising it,
they wander as their cupidity directs; lastly, they will never obtain
anything, seeing they pray without faith. For there cannot be a doubt
that all such prayers are made without faith, because at variance with
the word of God, on which if faith do not always lean it cannot possibly
stand. Those who, disregarding the Master's rule, indulge their own
wishes, not only have not the word of God, but as much as in them lies
oppose it. Hence Tertullian (De Fuga in Persecutione) has not less truly
than elegantly termed it *Lawful Prayer*, tacitly intimating that all
other prayers are lawless and illicit.
