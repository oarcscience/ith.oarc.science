#### <span id="iii.xlii-p0.1"></span>42.

<span id="iii.xlii-p1"></span>The second petition is, THY KINGDOM COME.
This contains nothing new, and yet there is good reason for
distinguishing it from the first. For if we consider our lethargy in the
greatest of all matters, we shall see how necessary it is that what
ought to be in itself perfectly known should be inculcated at greater
length. Therefore, after the injunction to pray that God would reduce to
order, and at length completely efface every stain which is thrown on
his sacred name, another petition, containing almost the same wish, is
added, viz., Thy kingdom come. Although a definition of this kingdom has
already been given, I now briefly repeat that God reigns when men, in
denial of themselves and contempt of the world and this earthly life,
devote themselves to righteousness and aspire to heaven (see Calvin,
Harm. <span id="iii.xlii-p1.1"></span>[Matth.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#000)<span id="iii.xlii-p1.1"></span>.md).
Thus this kingdom consists of two parts; the first is, when God by the
agency of his Spirit corrects all the depraved lusts of the flesh, which
in bands war against Him; and the second, when he brings all our
thoughts into obedience to his authority. This petition, therefore, is
duly presented only by those who begin with themselves; in other words,
who pray that they may be purified from all the corruptions which
disturb the tranquillity and impair the purity of God's kingdom. Then as
the word of God is like his royal sceptre, we are here enjoined to pray
that he would subdue all minds and hearts to voluntary obedience. This
is done when by the secret inspiration of his Spirit he displays the
efficacy of his word, and raises it to the place of honour which it
deserves. We must next descend to the wicked, who perversely and with
desperate madness resist his authority. God, therefore, sets up his
kingdom, by humbling the whole world, though in different ways, taming
the wantonness of some, and breaking the ungovernable pride of others.
We should desire this to be done every day, in order that God may gather
churches to himself from all quarters of the world, may extend and
increase their numbers, enrich them with his gifts, establish due order
among them; on the other hand, beat down all the enemies of pure
doctrine and religion, dissipate their counsels, defeat their attempts.
Hence it appears that there is good ground for the precept which enjoins
daily progress, for human affairs are never so prosperous as when the
impurities of vice are purged away, and integrity flourishes in full
vigour. The completion, however, is deferred to the final advent of
Christ, when, as Paul declares, "God will be all in all" (<span
id="iii.xlii-p1.2"></span>[1 Corinthians
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.xlii-p1.2"></span>). This prayer, therefore, ought to withdraw
us from the corruptions of the world which separate us from God, and
prevent his kingdom from flourishing within us; secondly, it ought to
inflame us with an ardent desire for the mortification of the flesh;
and, lastly, it ought to train us to the endurance of the cross; since
this is the way in which God would have his kingdom to be advanced. It
ought not to grieve us that the outward man decays provided the inner
man is renewed. For such is the nature of the kingdom of God, that while
we submit to his righteousness he makes us partakers of his glory. This
is the case when continually adding to his light and truth, by which the
lies and the darkness of Satan and his kingdom are dissipated,
extinguished, and destroyed, he protects his people, guides them aright
by the agency of his Spirit, and confirms them in perseverance; while,
on the other hand, he frustrates the impious conspiracies of his
enemies, dissipates their wiles and frauds, prevents their malice and
curbs their petulance, until at length he consume Antichrist "with the
spirit of his mouth," and destroy all impiety "with the brightness of
his coming" (<span id="iii.xlii-p1.3"></span>[2 Thessalonians
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md)<span id="iii.xlii-p1.3"></span>,
Calv. Comm.).
