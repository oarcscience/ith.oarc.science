#### <span id="iii.xl-p0.1"></span>40.

<span id="iii.xl-p1"></span>The next words are, WHICH ART IN HEAVEN.
From this we are not to infer that he is enclosed and confined within
the circumference of heaven, as by a kind of boundaries. Hence Solomon
confesses, "The heaven of heavens cannot contain thee" (<span
id="iii.xl-p1.1"></span>[1 Kings
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027)<span id="iii.xl-p1.1"></span>.md);
and he himself says by the Prophet, "The heaven is my throne, and the
earth is my footstool" (<span id="iii.xl-p1.2"></span>[Isaiah
56:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001)<span id="iii.xl-p1.2"></span>.md);
thereby intimating, that his presence, not confined to any region, is
diffused over all space. But as our gross minds are unable to conceive
of his ineffable glory, it is designated to us by *heaven*, nothing
which our eyes can behold being so full of splendour and majesty. While,
then, we are accustomed to regard every object as confined to the place
where our senses discern it, no place can be assigned to God; and hence,
if we would seek him, we must rise higher than all corporeal or mental
discernment. Again, this form of expression reminds us that he is far
beyond the reach of change or corruption, that he holds the whole
universe in his grasp, and rules it by his power. The effect of the
expressions therefore, is the same as if it had been said, that he is of
infinite majesty, incomprehensible essence, boundless power, and eternal
duration. When we thus speak of God, our thoughts must be raised to
their highest pitch; we must not ascribe to him anything of a
terrestrial or carnal nature, must not measure him by our little
standards, or suppose his will to be like ours. At the same time, we
must put our confidence in him, understanding that heaven and earth are
governed by his providence and power. In short, under the name of Father
is set before us that God, who hath appeared to us in his own image,
that we may invoke him with sure faith; the familiar name of Father
being given not only to inspire confidence, but also to curb our minds,
and prevent them from going astray after doubtful or fictitious gods. We
thus ascend from the only begotten Son to the supreme Father of angels
and of the Church. Then when his throne is fixed in heaven, we are
reminded that he governs the world, and, therefore, that it is not in
vain to approach him whose present care we actually experience. "He that
cometh to God," says the Apostle, "must believe that he is, and that he
is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him" (<span
id="iii.xl-p1.3"></span>[Hebrews
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006)<span id="iii.xl-p1.3"></span>.md).
Here Christ makes both claims for his Father, *first*, that we place our
faith in him; and, *secondly*, that we feel assured that our salvation
is not neglected by him, inasmuch as he condescends to extend his
providence to us. By these elementary principles Paul prepares us to
pray aright; for before enjoining us to make our requests known unto
God, he premises in this way, "The Lord is at hand. Be careful for
nothing" (<span id="iii.xl-p1.4"></span>[Phil.
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006)<span id="iii.xl-p1.4"></span>.md).
Whence it appears that doubt and perplexity hang over the prayers of
those in whose minds the belief is not firmly seated, that "the eyes of
the Lord are upon the righteous" (<span id="iii.xl-p1.5"></span>[Psalm
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015)<span id="iii.xl-p1.5"></span>.md).
