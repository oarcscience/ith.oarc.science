#### <span id="iii.x-p0.1"></span>10.

<span id="iii.x-p1"></span>Sometimes, however, the saints in
supplicating God, seem to appeal to their own righteousness, as when
David says, "Preserve my soul; for I am holy" (<span
id="iii.x-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
86:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#002)<span id="iii.x-p1.1"></span>.md).
Also Hezekiah, "Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee how I have walked
before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which
is good in thy sight" (<span id="iii.x-p1.2"></span>[Isaiah
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#002)<span id="iii.x-p1.2"></span>.md).
All they mean by such expressions is, that regeneration declares them to
be among the servants and children to whom God engages that he will show
favour. We have already seen how he declares by the Psalmist that his
eyes "are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry"
(<span id="iii.x-p1.3"></span>[Psalm
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.x-p1.3"></span><span id="iii.x-p1.4"></span>[Ps.
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016)<span id="iii.x-p1.4"></span>.md)
and again by the apostle, that "whatsoever we ask of him we obtain,
because we keep his commandments" (<span id="iii.x-p1.5"></span>[John
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#022)<span id="iii.x-p1.5"></span>.md). In
these passages he does not fix a value on prayer as a meritorious work,
but designs to establish the confidence of those who are conscious of an
unfeigned integrity and innocence, such as all believers should possess.
For the saying of the blind man who had received his sight is in perfect
accordance with divine truth, And God heareth not sinners (<span
id="iii.x-p1.6"></span>[John 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.x-p1.6"></span>); provided we take the term sinners in the sense
commonly used by Scripture to mean those who, without any desire for
righteousness, are sleeping secure in their sins; since no heart will
ever rise to genuine prayer that does not at the same time long for
holiness. Those supplications in which the saints allude to their purity
and integrity correspond to such promises, that they may thus have, in
their own experience, a manifestation of that which all the servants of
God are made to expect. Thus they almost always use this mode of prayer
when before God they compare themselves with their enemies, from whose
injustice they long to be delivered by his hand. When making such
comparisons, there is no wonder that they bring forward their integrity
and simplicity of heart, that thus, by the justice of their cause, the
Lord may be the more disposed to give them succour. We rob not the pious
breast of the privilege of enjoying a consciousness of purity before the
Lord, and thus feeling assured of the promises with which he comforts
and supports his true worshippers, but we would have them to lay aside
all thought of their own merits and found their confidence of success in
prayer solely on the divine mercy.
