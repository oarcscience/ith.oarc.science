<span id="iii.xlvi"></span>

#### <span id="iii.xlvi-p0.1"></span>46.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p1"></span>The sixth petition corresponds (as we have
observed) to the promise <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) of
*writing the law upon our hearts;* but because we do not obey God
without a continual warfare, without sharp and arduous contests, we here
pray that he would furnish us with armour, and defend us by his
protection, that we may be able to obtain the victory. By this we are
reminded that we not only have need of the gift of the Spirit inwardly
to soften our hearts, and turn and direct them to the obedience of God,
but also of his assistance, to render us invincible by all the wiles and
violent assaults of Satan. The forms of temptation are many and various.
The depraved conceptions of our minds provoking us to transgress the law
— conceptions which our concupiscence suggests or the devil excites, are
temptations; and things which in their own nature are not evil, become
temptations by the wiles of the devil, when they are presented to our
eyes in such a way that the view of them makes us withdraw or decline
from God. <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) These temptations are
both on the right hand and on the left. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) On the right, when riches, power, and
honours, which by their glare, and the semblance of good which they
present, generally dazzle the eyes of men, and so entice by their
blandishments, that, caught by their snares, and intoxicated by their
sweetness, they forget their God: on the left, when offended by the
hardship and bitterness of poverty, disgrace, contempt, afflictions, and
other things of that description, they despond, cast away their
confidence and hope, and are at length totally estranged from God. In
regard to both kinds of temptation, which either enkindled in us by
concupiscence, or presented by the craft of Satan's war against us, we
pray God the Father not to allow us to be overcome, but rather to raise
and support us by his hand, that strengthened by his mighty power we may
stand firm against all the assaults of our malignant enemy, whatever be
the thoughts which he sends into our minds; next we pray that whatever
of either description is allotted us, we may turn to good, that is, may
neither be inflated with prosperity, nor cast down by adversity. Here,
however, we do not ask to be altogether exempted from temptation, which
is very necessary to excite, stimulate, and urge us on, that we may not
become too lethargic. It was not without reason that David wished to be
tried, <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) nor is it without cause that
the Lord daily tries his elect, chastising them by disgrace, poverty,
tribulation, and other kinds of cross. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) But the temptations of God and Satan are
very different: Satan tempts, that he may destroy, condemn, confound,
throw headlong; God, that by proving his people he may make trial of
their sincerity, and by exercising their strength confirm it; may
mortify, tame, and cauterize their flesh, which, if not curbed in this
manner, would wanton and exult above measure. Besides, Satan attacks
those who are unarmed and unprepared, that he may destroy them unawares;
whereas whatever God sends, he "will with the temptation also make a way
to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) Whether by the term evil we understand
the devil or sin, is not of the least consequence. Satan is indeed the
very enemy who lays snares for our life, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) but it is by sin that he is armed for our
destruction.

<span id="iii.xlvi-p2"></span>Our petition, therefore, is, that we may
not be overcome or overwhelmed with temptation, but in the strength of
the Lord may stand firm against all the powers by which we are assailed;
in other words, may not fall under temptation: that being thus taken
under his charge and protection, we may remain invincible by sin, death,
the gates of hell, and the whole power of the devil; in other words, be
delivered from evil. Here it is carefully to be observed, that we have
no strength to contend with such a combatant as the devil, or to sustain
the violence of his assault. Were it otherwise, it would be mockery of
God to ask of him what we already possess in ourselves. Assuredly those
who in self-confidence prepare for such a fight, do not understand how
bold and well-equipped the enemy is with whom they have to do. Now we
ask to be delivered from his power, as from the mouth of some furious
raging lion, who would instantly tear us with his teeth and claws, and
swallow us up, did not the Lord rescue us from the midst of death; at
the same time knowing that if the Lord is present and will fight for us
while we stand by, through him "we shall do valiantly" (<span
id="iii.xlvi-p2.1"></span>[Psalm
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.xlvi-p2.1"></span>). Let others if they will confide in the
powers and resources of their free will which they think they possess;
enough for us that we stand and are strong in the power of God alone.
But the prayer comprehends more than at first sight it seems to do. For
if the Spirit of God is our strength in waging the contest with Satan,
we cannot gain the victory unless we are filled with him, and thereby
freed from all infirmity of the flesh. Therefore, when we pray to be
delivered from sin and Satan, we at the same time desire to be enriched
with new supplies of divine grace, until completely replenished with
them, we triumph over every evil. To some it seems rude and harsh to ask
God not to lead us into temptation, since, as James declares (<span
id="iii.xlvi-p2.2"></span>[James
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013)<span id="iii.xlvi-p2.2"></span>.md),
it is contrary to his nature to do so. This difficulty has already been
partly solved by the fact that our concupiscence is the cause, and
therefore properly bears the blame of all the temptations by which we
are overcome. All that James means is, that it is vain and unjust to
ascribe to God vices which our own consciousness compels us to impute to
ourselves. But this is no reason why God may not when he sees it meet
bring us into bondage to Satan, give us up to a reprobate mind and
shameful lusts, and so by a just, indeed, but often hidden judgment,
lead us into temptation. Though the cause is often concealed from men,
it is well known to him. Hence we may see that the expression is not
improper, if we are persuaded that it is not without cause he so often
threatens to give sure signs of his vengeance, by blinding the
reprobate, and hardening their hearts.
