<span id="iii.xxi-p1"></span>In regard to the saints who having died in
the body live in Christ, if we attribute prayer to them, let us not
imagine that they have any other way of supplicating God than through
Christ who alone is the way, or that their prayers are accepted by God
in any other name. Wherefore, since the Scripture calls us away from all
others to Christ alone, since our heavenly Father is pleased to gather
together all things in him, it were the extreme of stupidity, not to say
madness, to attempt to obtain access by means of others, so as to be
drawn away from him without whom access cannot be obtained. But who can
deny that this was the practice for several ages, and is still the
practice, wherever Popery prevails? To procure the favour of God, human
merits are ever and anon obtruded, and very frequently while Christ is
passed by, God is supplicated in their name. I ask if this is not to
transfer to them that office of sole intercession which we have above
claimed for Christ? Then what angel or devil ever announced one syllable
to any human being concerning that fancied intercession of theirs? There
is not a word on the subject in Scripture. What ground then was there
for the fiction? Certainly, while the human mind thus seeks help for
itself in which it is not sanctioned by the word of God, it plainly
manifests its distrust (see s. 27). But if we appeal to the consciences
of all who take pleasure in the intercession of saints, we shall find
that their only reason for it is, that they are filled with anxiety, as
if they supposed that Christ were insufficient or too rigorous. By this
anxiety they dishonour Christ, and rob him of his title of sole
Mediator, a title which being given him by the Father as his special
privilege, ought not to be transferred to any other. By so doing they
obscure the glory of his nativity and make void his cross; in short,
divest and defraud of due praise everything which he did or suffered,
since all which he did and suffered goes to show that he is and ought to
be deemed sole Mediator. At the same time, they reject the kindness of
God in manifesting himself to them as a Father, for he is not their
Father if they do not recognize Christ as their brother. This they
plainly refuse to do if they think not that he feels for them a
brother's affection; affection than which none can be more gentle or
tender. Wherefore Scripture offers him alone, sends us to him, and
establishes us in him. "He," says Ambrose, "is our mouth by which we
speak to the Father; our eye by which we see the Father; our right hand
by which we offer ourselves to the Father. Save by his intercession
neither we nor any saints have any intercourse with God" (Ambros. Lib.
de Isaac et Anima). If they object that the public prayers which are
offered up in churches conclude with the words, *through Jesus Christ
our Lord*, it is a frivolous evasion; because no less insult is offered
to the intercession of Christ by confounding it with the prayers and
merits of the dead, than by omitting it altogether, and making mention
only of the dead. Then, in all their litanies, hymns, and proses where
every kind of honour is paid to dead saints, there is no mention of
Christ.
