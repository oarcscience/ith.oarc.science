<span id="iii.xlv"></span>

#### <span id="iii.xlv-p0.1"></span>45.

<span id="iii.xlv-p1"></span>The next petition is, FORGIVE ITS OUR
DEBTS. In this and the following petition our Saviour has briefly
comprehended whatever is conducive to the heavenly life, as these two
members contain the spiritual covenant which God made for the salvation
of his Church, "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it on
their hearts." "I will pardon all their iniquities" (<span
id="iii.xlv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md)<span id="iii.xlv-p1.1"></span>;
<span id="iii.xlv-p1.2"></span>[Jeremiah
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008)<span id="iii.xlv-p1.2"></span>.md).
Here our Saviour begins with the forgiveness of sins, and then adds the
subsequent blessing, viz., that God would protect us by the power, and
support us by the aid of his Spirit, so that we may stand invincible
against all temptations. To sins he gives the name of *debts*, because
we owe the punishment due to them, a debt which we could not possibly
pay were we not discharged by this remission, the result of his free
mercy, when he freely expunges the debt, accepting nothing in return;
but of his own mercy receiving satisfaction in Christ, who gave himself
a ransom for us (<span id="iii.xlv-p1.3"></span>[Romans
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024)<span id="iii.xlv-p1.3"></span>.md).
Hence, those who expect to satisfy God by merits of their own or of
others, or to compensate and purchase forgiveness by means of
satisfactions, have no share in this free pardon, and while they address
God in this petition, do nothing more than subscribe their own
accusation, and seal their condemnation by their own testimony. For they
confess that they are debtors, unless they are discharged by means of
forgiveness. This forgiveness, however, they do not receive, but rather
reject, when they obtrude their merits and satisfactions upon God, since
by so doing they do not implore his mercy, but appeal to his justice.
Let those, again, who dream of a perfection which makes it unnecessary
to seek pardon, find their disciples among those whose itching ears
incline them to imposture, <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) (see
Calv. on <span id="iii.xlv-p1.6"></span>[Daniel
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020)<span id="iii.xlv-p1.6"></span>.md);
only let them understand that those whom they thus acquire have been
carried away from Christ, since he, by instructing all to confess their
guilt, receives none but sinners, not that he may soothe, and so
encourage them in their sins, but because he knows that believers are
never so divested of the sins of the flesh as not to remain subject to
the justice of God. It is, indeed, to be wished, it ought even to be our
strenuous endeavour, to perform all the parts of our duty, so as truly
to congratulate ourselves before God as being pure from every stain; but
as God is pleased to renew his image in us by degrees, so that to some
extent there is always a residue of corruption in our flesh, we ought by
no means to neglect the remedy. But if Christ, according to the
authority given him by his Father, enjoins us, during the whole course
of our lives, to implore pardon, who can tolerate those new teachers
who, by the phantom of perfect innocence, endeavour to dazzle the
simple, and make them believe that they can render themselves completely
free from guilt? This, as John declares, is nothing else than to make
God a liar (<span id="iii.xlv-p1.7"></span>[1 John
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010)<span id="iii.xlv-p1.7"></span>.md).
In like manner, those foolish men mutilate the covenant in which we have
seen that our salvation is contained by concealing one head of it, and
so destroying it entirely; being guilty not only of profanity in that
they separate things which ought to be indissolubly connected; but also
of wickedness and cruelty in overwhelming wretched souls with despair —
of treachery also to themselves and their followers, in that they
encourage themselves in a carelessness diametrically opposed to the
mercy of God. It is excessively childish to object, that when they long
for the advent of the kingdom of God, they at the same time pray for the
abolition of sin. In the former division of the prayer absolute
perfection is set before us; but in the latter our own weakness. Thus
the two fitly correspond to each other — we strive for the goal, and at
the same time neglect not the remedies which our necessities require.

<span id="iii.xlv-p2"></span>In the next part of the petition we pray to
be forgiven, "*as we forgive our debtors;*" that is, as we spare and
pardon all by whom we are in any way offended, either in deed by unjust,
or in word by contumelious treatment. Not that we can forgive the guilt
of a fault or offence; this belongs to God only; but we can forgive to
this extent: we can voluntarily divest our minds of wrath, hatred, and
revenge, and efface the remembrance of injuries by a voluntary oblivion.
Wherefore, we are not to ask the forgiveness of our sins from God,
unless we forgive the offenses of all who are or have been injurious to
us. If we retain any hatred in our minds, if we meditate revenge, and
devise the means of hurting; nay, if we do not return to a good
understanding with our enemies, perform every kind of friendly office,
and endeavour to effect a reconciliation with them, we by this petition
beseech God not to grant us forgiveness. For we ask him to do to us as
we do to others. This is the same as asking him not to do unless we do
also. What, then, do such persons obtain by this petition but a heavier
judgment? Lastly, it is to be observed that the condition of being
forgiven as we forgive our debtors, is not added because by forgiving
others we deserve forgiveness, as if the cause of forgiveness were
expressed; but by the use of this expression the Lord has been pleased
partly to solace the weakness of our faith, using it as a sign to assure
us that our sins are as certainly forgiven as we are certainly conscious
of having forgiven others, when our mind is completely purged from all
envy, hatred, and malice; and partly using as a badge by which he
excludes from the number of his children all who, prone to revenge and
reluctant to forgive, obstinately keep up their enmity, cherishing
against others that indignation which they deprecate from themselves; so
that they should not venture to invoke him as a Father. In the Gospel of
Luke, we have this distinctly stated in the words of Christ.
