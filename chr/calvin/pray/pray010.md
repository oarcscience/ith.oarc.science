#### <span id="iii.viii-p0.1"></span>8.

<span id="iii.viii-p1"></span>The third rule to be added is: that he who
comes into the presence of God to pray must divest himself of all
vainglorious thoughts, lay aside all idea of worth; in short, discard
all self-confidence, humbly giving God the whole glory, lest by
arrogating anything, however little, to himself, vain pride cause him to
turn away his face. Of this submission, which casts down all
haughtiness, we have numerous examples in the servants of God. The
holier they are, the more humbly they prostrate themselves when they
come into the presence of the Lord. Thus Daniel, on whom the Lord
himself bestowed such high commendation, says, "We do not present our
supplications before thee for our righteousness but for thy great
mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are
called by thy name." This he does not indirectly in the usual manner, as
if he were one of the individuals in a crowd: he rather confesses his
guilt apart, and as a suppliant betaking himself to the asylum of
pardon, he distinctly declares that he was confessing his own sin, and
the sin of his people Israel (<span id="iii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
9:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018)<span
id="iii.viii-p1.1"></span>). David also sets us an example of this
humility: " Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified" (<span
id="iii.viii-p1.2"></span>[Psalm
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002)<span
id="iii.viii-p1.2"></span>). In like manner, Isaiah prays, "Behold, thou
art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be
saved. But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses
are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities,
like the wind, have taken us away. And there is none that calleth upon
thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast
hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.
But now, O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our
potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. Be not wroth very sore, O
Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever: Behold, see, we beseech thee,
we are all thy people." (<span id="iii.viii-p1.3"></span>[Isaiah
64:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005)<span
id="iii.viii-p1.3"></span>). You see how they put no confidence in
anything but this: considering that they are the Lord's, they despair
not of being the objects of his care. In the same way, Jeremiah says, "O
Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy
name's sake" (<span id="iii.viii-p1.4"></span>[Jeremiah
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007)<span id="iii.viii-p1.4"></span>).
For it was most truly and piously written by the uncertain author
(whoever he may have been) that wrote the book which is attributed to
the prophet Baruch, <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) "But the soul that
is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping and feeble, and the eyes that
fail, and the hungry soul, will give thee praise and righteousness, O
Lord. Therefore, we do not make our humble supplication before thee, O
Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings."
"Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; for thou art merciful: and have pity upon
us, because we have sinned before thee" (<span
id="iii.viii-p1.7"></span>[Bar. 2:18](../../../bib/apo/bar002.htm#018),
[19](../../../bib/apo/bar002.htm#019)<span id="iii.viii-p1.7"></span>;
<span id="iii.viii-p1.8"></span>[Baruch
3:2](../../../bib/apo/bar003.htm#002)<span id="iii.viii-p1.8"></span>).

id="iii.viii-p1.6"></span>Pourtant ce qui est escrit en la prophetie
qu’on attribue à Baruch, combien que l’autheur soit incertain, est tres
sainctement dit;"—However, what is written in the prophecy which is
attributed to Baruch, though the author is uncertain, is very holily
said.
