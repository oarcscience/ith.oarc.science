#### <span id="iii.xiv-p0.1"></span>14.

<span id="iii.xiv-p1"></span>It is strange that these delightful
promises affect us coldly, or scarcely at all, so that the generality of
men prefer to wander up and down, forsaking the fountain of living
waters, and hewing out to themselves broken cisterns, rather than
embrace the divine liberality voluntarily offered to them (<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>.md).
"The name of the Lord," says Solomon, "is a strong tower; the righteous
runneth into it, and is safe." (<span id="iii.xiv-p1.2"></span>[Proverbs
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.2"></span>.md)
Joel, after predicting the fearful disaster which was at hand, subjoins
the following memorable sentence: " And it shall come to pass, that
whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered." (<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.3"></span>[Joel
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.3"></span>.md)
This we know properly refers to the course of the Gospel. Scarcely one
in a hundred is moved to come into the presence of God, though he
himself exclaims by Isaiah, "And it shall come to pass, that before they
call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear."
(<span id="iii.xiv-p1.4"></span>[Isaiah
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.4"></span>.md)
This honour he elsewhere bestows upon the whole Church in general, as
belonging to all the members of Christ: "He shall call upon me, and I
will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and
honour him." (<span id="iii.xiv-p1.5"></span>[Psalm
91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.5"></span>.md)
My intention, however, as I already observed, is not to enumerate all,
but only select some admirable passages as a specimen how kindly God
allures us to himself, and how extreme our ingratitude must be when with
such powerful motives our sluggishness still retards us. Wherefore, let
these words always resound in our ears: "The Lord is nigh unto all them
that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth" (<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.6"></span>[Psalm
145:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.6"></span>). Likewise those passages which we have quoted
from Isaiah and Joel, in which God declares that his ear is open to our
prayers, and that he is delighted as with a sacrifice of sweet savour
when we cast our cares upon him. The special benefit of these promises
we receive when we frame our prayer, not timorously or doubtingly, but
when trusting to his word whose majesty might otherwise deter us, we are
bold to call him Father, he himself deigning to suggest this most
delightful name. Fortified by such invitations it remains for us to know
that we have therein sufficient materials for prayer, since our prayers
depend on no merit of our own, but all their worth and hope of success
are founded and depend on the promises of God, so that they need no
other support, and require not to look up and down on this hand and on
that. It must therefore be fixed in our minds, that though we equal not
the lauded sanctity of patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, yet as the
command to pray is common to us as well as them, and faith is common, so
if we lean on the word of God, we are in respect of this privilege their
associates. For God declaring, as has already been seen, that he will
listen and be favourable to all, encourages the most wretched to hope
that they shall obtain what they ask; and, accordingly, we should attend
to the general forms of expression, which, as it is commonly expressed,
exclude none from first to last; only let there be sincerity of heart,
self-dissatisfaction, humility, and faith, that we may not, by the
hypocrisy of a deceitful prayer, profane the name of God. Our most
merciful Father will not reject those whom he not only encourages to
come, but urges in every possible way. Hence David's method of prayer to
which I lately referred: "And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and
thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy
servant, that it may continue for ever before thee" (<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.7"></span>[2 Samuel
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#028)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.7"></span>.md).
So also, in another passage, "Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be
for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant" (<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.8"></span>[Psalm
119:76](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#076.md)<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.8"></span>). And the whole body of the Israelites,
whenever they fortify themselves with the remembrance of the covenant,
plainly declare, that since God thus prescribes they are not to pray
timorously (<span id="iii.xiv-p1.9"></span>[Genesis
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#013)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.9"></span>.md).
In this they imitated the example of the patriarchs, particularly Jacob,
who, after confessing that he was unworthy of the many mercies which he
had received of the Lord's hand, says, that he is encouraged to make
still larger requests, because God had promised that he would grant
them. But whatever be the pretexts which unbelievers employ, when they
do not flee to God as often as necessity urges, nor seek after him, nor
implore his aid, they defraud him of his due honour just as much as if
they were fabricating to themselves new gods and idols, since in this
way they deny that God is the author of all their blessings. On the
contrary, nothing more effectually frees pious minds from every doubt,
than to be armed with the thought that no obstacle should impede them
while they are obeying the command of God, who declares that nothing is
more grateful to him than obedience. Hence, again, what I have
previously said becomes still more clear, namely, that a bold spirit in
prayer well accords with fear, reverence, and anxiety, and that there is
no inconsistency when God raises up those who had fallen prostrate. In
this way forms of expression apparently inconsistent admirably
harmonize. Jeremiah and David speak of humbly laying their
supplications <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) before God (<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.13"></span>[Jeremiah
42:9;](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#009.md)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.13"></span>
<span id="iii.xiv-p1.14"></span>[Daniel
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.14"></span>.md).
In another passage Jeremiah says "Let, we beseech thee, our supplication
be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the Lord thy God, even for
all this remnant" (<span id="iii.xiv-p1.15"></span>[Jeremiah
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.15"></span>.md).
On the other hand, believers are often said to *lift up prayer*. Thus
Hezekiah speaks, when asking the prophet to undertake the office of
interceding (<span id="iii.xiv-p1.16"></span>[2 Kings
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#004)<span id="iii.xiv-p1.16"></span>.md).
And David says, "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and
the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice" (<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.17"></span>[Ps.
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.xiv-p1.17"></span>). The explanation is, that though believers,
persuaded of the paternal love of God, cheerfully rely on his
faithfulness, and have no hesitation in imploring the aid which he
voluntarily offers, they are not elated with supine or presumptuous
security; but climbing up by the ladder of the promises, still remain
humble and abased suppliants.
