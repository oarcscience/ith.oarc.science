*Of Prayer*, by John Calvin, tr. Henry Beveridge \[1845\], at Intangible

<span id="iii.xxxiv-p1"></span>We must now attend not only to a surer
method, but also form of prayer, that, namely, which our heavenly Father
has delivered to us by his beloved Son, and in which we may recognize
his boundless goodness and condescension (<span
id="iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>[Matthew
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md)<span id="iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>;
<span id="iii.xxxiv-p1.2"></span>[Luke
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.xxxiv-p1.2"></span>). Besides admonishing and exhorting us to
seek him in our every necessity (as children are wont to betake
themselves to the protection of their parents when oppressed with any
anxiety), seeing that we were not fully aware how great our poverty was,
or what was right or for our interest to ask, he has provided for this
ignorance; that wherein our capacity failed he has sufficiently
supplied. For he has given us a form in which is set before us as in a
picture everything which it is lawful to wish, everything which is
conducive to our interest, everything which it is necessary to demand.
From his goodness in this respect we derive the great comfort of
knowing, that as we ask almost in his words, we ask nothing that is
absurd, or foreign, or unseasonable; nothing, in short, that is not
agreeable to him. Plato, seeing the ignorance of men in presenting their
desires to God, desires which if granted would often be most injurious
to them, declares the best form of prayer to be that which an ancient
poet has furnished: "O king Jupiter, give what is best, whether we wish
it or wish it not; but avert from us what is evil even though we ask it"
(Plato, Alcibiad. ii). This heathen shows his wisdom in discerning how
dangerous it is to ask of God what our own passion dictates; while, at
the same time, he reminds us of our unhappy condition in not being able
to open our lips before God without dangers unless his Spirit instruct
us how to pray aright (<span id="iii.xxxiv-p1.3"></span>[Romans
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.xxxiv-p1.3"></span>). The higher value, therefore, ought we to
set on the privilege, when the only begotten Son of God puts words into
our lips, and thus relieves our minds of all hesitation.
