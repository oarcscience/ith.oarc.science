<span id="iii.xxxvii-p1"></span>Nor let us allege that we are justly
rendered timid by a consciousness of sin, by which our Father, though
mild and merciful, is daily offended. For if among men a son cannot have
a better advocate to plead his cause with his father, and cannot employ
a better intercessor to regain his lost favour, than if he come himself
suppliant and downcast, acknowledging his fault, to implore the mercy of
his father, whose paternal feelings cannot but be moved by such
entreaties, what will that "Father of all mercies, and God of all
comfort," do? (<span id="iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>). Will he not rather listen to the tears
and groans of his children, when supplicating for themselves (especially
seeing he invites and exhorts us to do so), than to any advocacy of
others to whom the timid have recourse, not without some semblance of
despair, because they are distrustful of their father's mildness and
clemency? The exuberance of his paternal kindness he sets before us in
the parable (<span id="iii.xxxvii-p1.2"></span>[Luke
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.xxxvii-p1.2"></span>; see Calv. Comm). when the father with open
arms receives the son who had gone away from him, wasted his substance
in riotous living, and in all ways grievously sinned against him. He
waits not till pardon is asked in words, but, anticipating the request,
recognizes him afar off, runs to meet him, consoles him, and restores
him to favour. By setting before us this admirable example of mildness
in a man, he designed to show in how much greater abundance we may
expect it from him who is not only a Father, but the best and most
merciful of all fathers, however ungrateful, rebellious, and wicked sons
we may be, provided only we throw ourselves upon his mercy. And the
better to assure us that he is such a Father if we are Christians, he
has been pleased to be called not only a Father, but our Father, as if
we were pleading with him after this manner, O Father, who art possessed
of so much affection for thy children, and art so ready to forgive, we
thy children approach thee and present our requests, fully persuaded
that thou hast no other feelings towards us than those of a father,
though we are unworthy of such a parent. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) But as our narrow hearts are incapable of
comprehending such boundless favour, Christ is not only the earnest and
pledge of our adoption, but also gives us the Spirit as a witness of
this adoption, that through him we may freely cry aloud, Abba, Father.
Whenever, therefore, we are restrained by any feeling of hesitation, let
us remember to ask of him that he may correct our timidity, and placing
us under the magnanimous guidance of the Spirit, enable us to pray
boldly.
