<p><a name="iii.iii-p1"></A>But some one will say, Does he not know without a monitor both what  our difficulties are, and what is meet for our interest, so that it seems in  some measure superfluous to solicit him by our prayers, as if he were winking,  or even sleeping, until aroused by the sound of our voice?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>
 Those who  argue thus attend not to the end for which the Lord taught us to pray. It was  not so much for his sake as for ours. He wills indeed, as is just, that due  honour be paid him by acknowledging that all which men desire or feel to be  useful, and pray to obtain, is derived from him. But even the benefit of the  homage which we thus pay him redounds to ourselves. Hence the holy patriarchs,  the more confidently they proclaimed the mercies of God to themselves and others  felt the stronger incitement to prayer. It will be sufficient to refer to the  example of Elijah, who being assured of the purpose of God had good ground for  the promise of rain which he gives to Ahab, and yet prays anxiously upon his  knees, and sends his servant seven times to inquire (<a name="iii.iii-p1.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#042">1 Kings 18:42</a><a name="iii.iii-p1.3"></A>); not that he  discredits the oracle, but because he knows it to be his duty to lay his desires  before God, lest his faith should become drowsy or torpid. Wherefore, although  it is true that while we are listless or insensible to our wretchedness, he  wakes and watches for use and sometimes even assists us unasked; it is very much  for our interest to be constantly supplicating him; first, that our heart may  always be inflamed with a serious and ardent desire of seeking, loving and  serving him, while we accustom ourselves to have recourse to him as a sacred  anchor in every necessity; secondly, that no desires, no longing whatever, of  which we are ashamed to make him the witness, may enter our minds, while we  learn to place all our wishes in his sight, and thus pour out our heart before  him; and, lastly, that we may be prepared to receive all his benefits with true  gratitude and thanksgiving, while our prayers remind us that they proceed from  his hand. Moreover, having obtained what we asked, being persuaded that he has  answered our prayers, we are led to long more earnestly for his favour, and at  the same time have greater pleasure in welcoming the blessings which we perceive  to have been obtained by our prayers. Lastly, use and experience confirm the  thought of his providence in our minds in a manner adapted to our weakness, when  we understand that he not only promises that he will never fail us, and  spontaneously gives us access to approach him in every time of need, but has his  hand always stretched out to assist his people, not amusing them with words, but  proving himself to be a present aid. For these reasons, though our most merciful  Father never slumbers nor sleeps, he very often seems to do so, that thus he may  exercise us, when we might otherwise be listless and slothful, in asking,  entreating, and earnestly beseeching him to our great good. It is very absurd,  therefore, to dissuade men from prayer, by pretending that Divine Providence,  which is always watching over the government of the universes is in vain  importuned by our supplications, when, on the contrary, the Lord himself  declares, that he is "nigh unto all that call upon him, to all that call upon  him in truth (<a name="iii.iii-p1.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018">Psalm 145:18</a><a name="iii.iii-p1.4"></A>). No better is the frivolous allegation of others, that  it is superfluous to pray for things which the Lord is ready of his own accord  to bestow; since it is his pleasure that those very things which flow from his  spontaneous liberality should be acknowledged as conceded to our prayers. This  is testified by that memorable sentence in the psalms to which many others  corresponds: "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open  unto their cry" (<a name="iii.iii-p1.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015">Psalm 34:15</a><a name="iii.iii-p1.5"></A>). This passage, while extolling the care which Divine  Providence spontaneously exercises over the safety of believers, omits not the  exercise of faith by which the mind is aroused from sloth. The eyes of God are  awake to assist the blind in their necessity, but he is likewise pleased to  listen to our groans, that he may give us the better proof of his love. And thus  both things are true, "He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep"  (<a name="iii.iii-p1.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#004">Psalm 121:4</a><a name="iii.iii-p1.6"></A>); and yet whenever he sees us dumb and torpid, he withdraws as if he  had forgotten us.</p>
