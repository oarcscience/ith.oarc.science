### <span id="iv.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 1.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p1"></span>THROUGH THE FALL AND REVOLT OF ADAM, THE
WHOLE HUMAN RACE MADE ACCURSED AND DEGENERATE. OF ORIGINAL SIN.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>I. How necessary the knowledge of
ourselves is, its nature, the danger of mistake, its leading parts,
sect. 1, 2, 3. II. The causes of Adam’s fearful fall, sect. 4. III. The
effects of the fall extending to Adam’s posterity, and all the
creatures, sect. 5, to the end of the Chapter, where the nature,
propagation, and effect of original sin are considered.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p3"></span>*Sections.*

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p4"></span>1. The knowledge of ourselves most
necessary. To use it properly we must be divested of pride, and clothed
with true humility, which will dispose us to consider our fall, and
embrace the mercy of God in Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p5"></span>2. Though there is plausibility in the
sentiment which stimulates us to self-admiration, the only sound
sentiment is that which inclines us to true humbleness of mind. Pretexts
for pride. The miserable vanity of sinful man.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p6"></span>3. Different views taken by carnal wisdom
and by conscience, which appeals to divine justice as its standard. The
knowledge of ourselves, consisting of two parts, the former of which
having already been discussed, the latter is here considered.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p7"></span>4. In considering this latter part, two
points to be considered; 1. How it happened that Adam involved himself
and the whole human race in this dreadful calamity. This the result not
of sensual intemperance, but of infidelity (the source of other heinous
sins), which led to revolt from God, from whom all true happiness must
be derived. An enumeration of the other sins produced by the infidelity
of the first man.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p8"></span>5. The second point to be considered is,
the extent to which the contagious influence of the fall extends. It
extends, 1. To all the creatures, though unoffending; and, 2. To the
whole posterity of Adam. Hence hereditary corruption, or original sin,
and the depravation of a nature which was previously pure and good. This
depravation communicated to the whole posterity of Adam, but not in the
way supposed by the Pelagians and Celestians.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p9"></span>6. Depravation communicated not merely by
imitation, but by propagation. This proved, 1. From the contrast drawn
between Adam and Christ. Confirmation from passages of Scripture; 2 From
the general declaration that we are the children of wrath.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p10"></span>7. Objection, that if Adam’s sin is
propagated to his posterity, the soul must be derived by transmission.
Answer. Another objection—viz. that children cannot derive corruption
from pious parents. Answer.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p11"></span>8. Definition of original sin. Two parts
in the definition. Exposition of the latter part. Original sin exposes
us to the wrath of God. It also produces in us the works of the flesh.
Other definitions considered.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p12"></span>9. Exposition of the former part of the
definition—viz. that hereditary depravity extends to all the faculties
of the soul.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p13"></span>10. From the exposition of both parts of
the definition it follows that God is not the author of sin, the whole
human race being corrupted by an inherent viciousness.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p14"></span>11. This, however, is not from nature,
but is an adventitious quality. Accordingly, the dream of the Manichees
as to two principles vanishes.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p15"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p16"></span>1. It was not without reason that the
ancient proverb so strongly recommended to man the knowledge of himself.
For if it is deemed disgraceful to be ignorant of things pertaining to
the business of life, much more disgraceful is self-ignorance, in
consequence of which we miserably deceive ourselves in matters of the
highest moment, and so walk blindfold. But the more useful the precept
is, the more careful we must be not to use it preposterously, as we see
certain philosophers have done. For they, when exhorting man to know
himself, state the motive to be, that he may not be ignorant of his own
excellence and dignity. They wish him to see nothing in himself but what
will fill him with vain confidence, and inflate him with pride. But
self-knowledge consists in this, *first*, When reflecting on what God
gave us at our creation, and still continues graciously to give, we
perceive how great the excellence of our nature would have been had its
integrity remained, and, at the same time, remember that we have nothing
of our own, but depend entirely on God, from whom we hold at pleasure
whatever he has seen it meet to bestow; *secondly*, When viewing our
miserable condition since Adam’s fall, all confidence and boasting are
overthrown, we blush for shame, and feel truly humble. For as God at
first formed us in his own image, that he might elevate our minds to the
pursuit of virtue, and the contemplation of eternal life, so to prevent
us from heartlessly burying those noble qualities which distinguish us
from the lower animals, it is of importance to know that we were endued
with reason and intelligence, in order that we might cultivate a holy
and honourable life, and regard a blessed immortality as our destined
aim. At the same time, it is impossible to think of our primeval dignity
without being immediately reminded of the sad spectacle of our ignominy
and corruption, ever since we fell from our original in the person of
our first parent. In this way, we feel dissatisfied with ourselves, and
become truly humble, while we are inflamed with new desires to seek
after God, in whom each may regain those good qualities of which all are
found to be utterly destitute.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p17"></span>2. In examining ourselves, the search
which divine truth enjoins, and the knowledge which it demands, are such
as may indispose us to every thing like confidence in our own powers,
leave us devoid of all means of boasting, and so incline us to
submission. This is the course which we must follow, if we would attain
to the true goal, both in speculation and practice. I am not unaware how
much more plausible the view is, which invites us rather to ponder on
our good qualities, than to contemplate what must overwhelm us with
shame—our miserable destitution and ignominy. There is nothing more
acceptable to the human mind than flattery, and, accordingly, when told
that its endowments are of a high order, it is apt to be excessively
credulous. Hence it is not strange that the greater part of mankind have
erred so egregiously in this matter. Owing to the innate self-love by
which all are blinded, we most willingly persuade ourselves that we do
not possess a single quality which is deserving of hatred; and hence,
independent of any countenance from without, general credit is given to
the very foolish idea, that man is perfectly sufficient of himself for
all the purposes of a good and happy life. If any are disposed to think
more modestly, and concede somewhat to God, that they may not seem to
arrogate every thing as their own, still, in making the division, they
apportion matters so, that the chief ground of confidence and boasting
always remains with themselves. Then, if a discourse is pronounced which
flatters the pride spontaneously springing up in man’s inmost heart,
nothing seems more delightful. Accordingly, in every age, he who is most
forward in extolling the excellence of human nature, is received with
the loudest applause. But be this heralding of human excellence what it
may, by teaching man to rest in himself, it does nothing more than
fascinate by its sweetness, and, at the same time, so delude as to drown
in perdition all who assent to it. For what avails it to proceed in vain
confidence, to deliberate, resolve, plan, and attempt what we deem
pertinent to the purpose, and, at the very outset, prove deficient and
destitute both of sound intelligence and true virtue, though we still
confidently persist till we rush headlong on destruction? But this is
the best that can happen to those who put confidence in their own
powers. Whosoever, therefore, gives heed to those teachers, who merely
employ us in contemplating our good qualities, so far from making
progress in self-knowledge, will be plunged into the most pernicious
ignorance.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p18"></span>3. While revealed truth concurs with the
general consent of mankind in teaching that the second part of wisdom
consists in self-knowledge, they differ greatly as to the method by
which this knowledge is to be acquired. In the judgment of the flesh man
deems his self-knowledge complete, when, with overweening confidence in
his own intelligence and integrity, he takes courage, and spurs himself
on to virtuous deeds, and when, declaring war upon vice, he uses his
utmost endeavour to attain to the honourable and the fair. But he who
tries himself by the standard of divine justice, finds nothing to
inspire him with confidence; and hence, the more thorough his
self-examination, the greater his despondency. Abandoning all dependence
on himself, he feels that he is utterly incapable of duly regulating his
conduct. It is not the will of God, however, that we should forget the
primeval dignity which he bestowed on our first parents—a dignity which
may well stimulate us to the pursuit of goodness and justice. It is
impossible for us to think of our first original, or the end for which
we were created, without being urged to meditate on immortality, and to
seek the kingdom of God. But such meditation, so far from raising our
spirits, rather casts them down, and makes us humble. For what is our
original? One from which we have fallen. What the end of our creation?
One from which we have altogether strayed, so that, weary of our
miserable lot, we groan, and groaning sigh for a dignity now lost. When
we say that man should see nothing in himself which can raise his
spirits, our meaning is, that he possesses nothing on which he can
proudly plume himself. Hence, in considering the knowledge which man
ought to have of himself, it seems proper to divide it thus, *first*, to
consider the end for which he was created, and the qualities—by no means
contemptible qualities—with which he was endued, thus urging him to
meditate on divine worship and the future life; and, *secondly*, to
consider his faculties, or rather want of faculties—a want which, when
perceived, will annihilate all his confidence, and cover him with
confusion. The tendency of the former view is to teach him what his duty
is, of the latter, to make him aware how far he is able to perform it.
We shall treat of both in their proper order.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p19"></span>4. As the act which God punished so
severely must have been not a trivial fault, but a heinous crime, it
will be necessary to attend to the peculiar nature of the sin which
produced Adam’s fall, and provoked God to inflict such fearful vengeance
on the whole human race. The common idea of sensual intemperance is
childish. The sum and substance of all virtues could not consist in
abstinence from a single fruit amid a general abundance of every
delicacy that could be desired, the earth, with happy fertility,
yielding not only abundance, but also endless variety. We must,
therefore, look deeper than sensual intemperance. The prohibition to
touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a trial of
obedience, that Adam, by observing it, might prove his willing
submission to the command of God. For the very term shows the end of the
precept to have been to keep him contented with his lot, and not allow
him arrogantly to aspire beyond it. The promise, which gave him hope of
eternal life as long as he should eat of the tree of life, and, on the
other hand, the fearful denunciation of death the moment he should taste
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, were meant to prove and
exercise his faith. Hence it is not difficult to infer in what way Adam
provoked the wrath of God. Augustine, indeed, is not far from the mark,
when he says (in <span id="iv.ii.ii-p19.1"></span>[Psal.
19](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#000)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p19.1"></span>.md),
that pride was the beginning of all evil, because, had not man’s
ambition carried him higher than he was permitted, he might have
continued in his first estate. A further definition, however, must be
derived from the kind of temptation which Moses describes. When, by the
subtlety of the devil, the woman faithlessly abandoned the command of
God, her fall obviously had its origin in disobedience. This Paul
confirms, when he says, that, by the disobedience of one man, all were
destroyed. At the same time, it is to be observed, that the first man
revolted against the authority of God, not only in allowing himself to
be ensnared by the wiles of the devil, but also by despising the truth,
and turning aside to lies. Assuredly, when the word of God is despised,
all reverence for Him is gone. His majesty cannot be duly honoured among
us, nor his worship maintained in its integrity, unless we hang as it
were upon his lips. Hence infidelity was at the root of the revolt. From
infidelity, again, sprang ambition and pride, together with ingratitude;
because Adam, by longing for more than was allotted him, manifested
contempt for the great liberality with which God had enriched him. It
was surely monstrous impiety that a son of earth should deem it little
to have been made in the likeness, unless he were also made the equal of
God. If the apostasy by which man withdraws from the authority of his
Maker, nay, petulantly shakes off his allegiance to him, is a foul and
execrable crime, it is in vain to extenuate the sin of Adam. Nor was it
simple apostasy. It was accompanied with foul insult to God, the guilty
pair assenting to Satan’s calumnies when he charged God with malice,
envy, and falsehood. In fine, infidelity opened the door to ambition,
and ambition was the parent of rebellion, man casting off the fear of
God, and giving free vent to his lust. Hence, Bernard truly says, that,
in the present day, a door of salvation is opened to us when we receive
the gospel with our ears, just as by the same entrance, when thrown open
to Satan, death was admitted. Never would Adam have dared to show any
repugnance to the command of God if he had not been incredulous as to
his word. The strongest curb to keep all his affections under due
restraint, would have been the belief that nothing was better than to
cultivate righteousness by obeying the commands of God, and that the
highest possible felicity was to be loved by him.14  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) Man, therefore, when carried away by
the blasphemies of Satan, did his very utmost to annihilate the whole
glory of God.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p21"></span>5. As Adam’s spiritual life would have
consisted in remaining united and bound to his Maker, so estrangement
from him was the death of his soul. Nor is it strange that he who
perverted the whole order of nature in heaven and earth deteriorated his
race by his revolt. “The whole creation groaneth,” saith St Paul, “being
made subject to vanity, not willingly,” (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p21.1"></span>[Rom. 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p21.1"></span>.md).
If the reason is asked, there cannot be a doubt that creation bears part
of the punishment deserved by man, for whose use all other creatures
were made. Therefore, since through man’s fault a curse has extended
above and below, over all the regions of the world, there is nothing
unreasonable in its extending to all his offspring. After the heavenly
image in man was effaced, he not only was himself punished by a
withdrawal of the ornaments in which he had been arrayed—viz. wisdom,
virtue, justice, truth, and holiness, and by the substitution in their
place of those dire pests, blindness, impotence, vanity, impurity, and
unrighteousness, but he involved his posterity also, and plunged them in
the same wretchedness. This is the hereditary corruption to which early
Christian writers gave the name of Original Sin, meaning by the term the
depravation of a nature formerly good and pure. The subject gave rise to
much discussion, there being nothing more remote from common
apprehension, than that the fault of one should render all guilty, and
so become a common sin. This seems to be the reason why the oldest
doctors of the church only glance obscurely at the point, or, at least,
do not explain it so clearly as it required. This timidity, however,
could not prevent the rise of a Pelagius with his profane fiction—that
Adam sinned only to his own hurt, but did no hurt to his posterity.
Satan, by thus craftily hiding the disease, tried to render it
incurable. But when it was clearly proved from Scripture that the sin of
the first man passed to all his posterity, recourse was had to the
cavil, that it passed by imitation, and not by propagation. The
orthodoxy, therefore, and more especially Augustine, laboured to show,
that we are not corrupted by acquired wickedness, but bring an innate
corruption from the very womb. It was the greatest impudence to deny
this. But no man will wonder at the presumption of the Pelagians and
Celestians, who has learned from the writings of that holy man how
extreme the effrontery of these heretics was. Surely there is no
ambiguity in David’s confession, “I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin
did my mother conceive me,” (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p21.2"></span>[Ps.
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p21.2"></span>). His object in the passage is not to throw
blame on his parents; but the better to commend the goodness of God
towards him, he properly reiterates the confession of impurity from his
very birth. As it is clear, that there was no peculiarity in David’s
case, it follows that it is only an instance of the common lot of the
whole human race. All of us, therefore, descending from an impure seed,
come into the world tainted with the contagion of sin. Nay, before we
behold the light of the sun we are in God’s sight defiled and polluted.
“Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one,” says the Book
of Job (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p21.3"></span>[Job
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p21.3"></span>).

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p22"></span>6. We thus see that the impurity of
parents is transmitted to their children, so that all, without
exception, are originally depraved. The commencement of this depravity
will not be found until we ascend to the first parent of all as the
fountain head. We must, therefore, hold it for certain, that, in regard
to human nature, Adam was not merely a progenitor, but, as it were, a
root, and that, accordingly, by his corruption, the whole human race was
deservedly vitiated. This is plain from the contrast which the Apostle
draws between Adam and Christ, “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered
into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for
that all have sinned; even so might grace reign through righteousness
unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord,” (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p22.1"></span>[Rom.
5:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p22.1"></span>). To what quibble will the Pelagians here
recur? That the sin of Adam was propagated by imitation! Is the
righteousness of Christ then available to us only in so far as it is an
example held forth for our imitation? Can any man tolerate such
blasphemy? But if, out of all controversy, the righteousness of Christ,
and thereby life, is ours by communication, it follows that both of
these were lost in Adam that they might be recovered in Christ, whereas
sin and death were brought in by Adam, that they might be abolished in
Christ. There is no obscurity in the words, “As by one man’s
disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
many be made righteous.” Accordingly, the relation subsisting between
the two is this, As Adam, by his ruin, involved and ruined us, so
Christ, by his grace, restored us to salvation. In this clear light of
truth I cannot see any need of a longer or more laborious proof. Thus,
too, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, when Paul would confirm
believers in the confident hope of the resurrection, he shows that the
life is recovered in Christ which was lost in Adam (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p22.2"></span>[1 Cor.
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p22.2"></span>). Having already declared that all died in
Adam, he now also openly testifies, that all are imbued with the taint
of sin. Condemnation, indeed, could not reach those who are altogether
free from blame. But his meaning cannot be made clearer than from the
other member of the sentence, in which he shows that the hope of life is
restored in Christ. Every one knows that the only mode in which this is
done is, when by a wondrous communication Christ transfuses into us the
power of his own righteousness, as it is elsewhere said, “The Spirit is
life because of righteousness,” (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p22.3"></span>[1
Cor. 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p22.3"></span>). Therefore, the only explanation which can
be given of the expression, “in Adam all died,” is, that he by sinning
not only brought disaster and ruin upon himself, but also plunged our
nature into like destruction; and that not only in one fault, in a
matter not pertaining to us, but by the corruption into which he himself
fell, he infected his whole seed. Paul never could have said that all
are “by nature the children of wrath,” (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p22.4"></span>[Eph.
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p22.4"></span>.md),
if they had not been cursed from the womb. And it is obvious that the
nature there referred to is not nature such as God created, but as
vitiated in Adam; for it would have been most incongruous to make God
the author of death. Adam, therefore, when he corrupted himself,
transmitted the contagion to all his posterity. For a heavenly Judge,
even our Saviour himself, declares that all are by birth vicious and
depraved, when he says that “that which is born of the flesh is fleshy”
(<span id="iv.ii.ii-p22.5"></span>[John
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p22.5"></span>.md),
and that therefore the gate of life is closed against all until they
have been regenerated.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p23"></span>7. To the understanding of this subject,
there is no necessity for an anxious discussion (which in no small
degree perplexed the ancient doctors), as to whether the soul of the
child comes by transmission from the soul of the parent.14  <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) It should be enough for us to know
that Adam was made the depository of the endowments which God was
pleased to bestow on human nature, and that, therefore, when he lost
what he had received, he lost not only for himself but for us all. Why
feel any anxiety about the transmission of the soul, when we know that
the qualities which Adam lost he received for us not less than for
himself, that they were not gifts to a single man, but attributes of the
whole human race? There is nothing absurd, therefore, in the view, that
when he was divested, his nature was left naked and destitute that he
having been defiled by sin, the pollution extends to all his seed. Thus,
from a corrupt root corrupt branches proceeding, transmit their
corruption to the saplings which spring from them. The children being
vitiated in their parent, conveyed the taint to the grandchildren; in
other words, corruption commencing in Adam, is, by perpetual descent,
conveyed from those preceding to those coming after them. The cause of
the contagion is neither in the substance of the flesh nor the soul, but
God was pleased to ordain that those gifts which he had bestowed on the
first man, that man should lose as well for his descendants as for
himself. The Pelagian cavil, as to the improbability of children
deriving corruption from pious parents, whereas, they ought rather to be
sanctified by their purity, is easily refuted. Children come not by
spiritual regeneration but carnal descent.14  <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) Accordingly, as Augustine says, “Both
the condemned unbeliever and the acquitted believer beget offspring not
acquitted but condemned, because the nature which begets is corrupt.”14
 <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) Moreover, though godly parents
do in some measure contribute to the holiness of their offspring, this
is by the blessing of God; a blessing, however, which does not prevent
the primary and universal curse of the whole race from previously taking
effect. Guilt is from nature, whereas sanctification is from
supernatural grace.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p27"></span>8. But lest the thing itself of which we
speak be unknown or doubtful, it will be proper to define original sin.
(Calvin, in Conc. Trident. 1, Dec. Sess. 5). I have no intention,
however, to discuss all the definitions which different writers have
adopted, but only to adduce the one which seems to me most accordant
with truth. Original sin, then, may be defined a hereditary corruption
and depravity of our nature, extending to all the parts of the soul,
which first makes us obnoxious to the wrath of God, and then produces in
us works which in Scripture are termed works of the flesh. This
corruption is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term sin14  <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p28.1"></span>[Gal.
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p28.1"></span>); while the works which proceed from it,
such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he
terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin, though in various passages of
Scripture, and even by Paul himself, they are also termed sins. The two
things, therefore, are to be distinctly observed—viz. that being thus
perverted and corrupted in all the parts of our nature, we are, merely
on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom
nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity. This is
not liability for another’s fault. For when it is said, that the sin of
Adam has made us obnoxious to the justice of God, the meaning is not,
that we, who are in ourselves innocent and blameless, are bearing his
guilt, but that since by his transgression we are all placed under the
curse, he is said to have brought us under obligation.14  <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) Through him, however, not only has
punishment been derived, but pollution instilled, for which punishment
is justly due. Hence Augustine, though he often terms it another’s sin
(that he may more clearly show how it comes to us by descent), at the
same time asserts that it is each individual’s own sin.14  <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) And the Apostle most distinctly
testifies, that “death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned,”
(<span id="iv.ii.ii-p30.1"></span>[Rom.
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p30.1"></span>); that is, are involved in original sin, and
polluted by its stain. Hence, even infants bringing their condemnation
with them from their mother’s womb, suffer not for another’s, but for
their own defect. For although they have not yet produced the fruits of
their own unrighteousness, they have the seed implanted in them. Nay,
their whole nature is, as it were, a seed-bed of sin, and therefore
cannot but be odious and abominable to God. Hence it follows, that it is
properly deemed sinful in the sight of God; for there could be no
condemnation without guilt. Next comes the other point—viz. that this
perversity in us never ceases, but constantly produces new fruits, in
other words, those works of the flesh which we formerly described; just
as a lighted furnace sends forth sparks and flames, or a fountain
without ceasing pours out water. Hence, those who have defined original
sin as the want of the original righteousness which we ought to have
had, though they substantially comprehend the whole case, do not
significantly enough express its power and energy. For our nature is not
only utterly devoid of goodness, but so prolific in all kinds of evil,
that it can never be idle. Those who term it *concupiscence* use a word
not very inappropriate, provided it were added (this, however, many will
by no means concede), that everything which is in man, from the
intellect to the will, from the soul even to the flesh, is defiled and
pervaded with this concupiscence; or, to express it more briefly, that
the whole man is in himself nothing else than concupiscence.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31"></span>9. I have said, therefore, that all the
parts of the soul were possessed by sin, ever since Adam revolted from
the fountain of righteousness. For not only did the inferior appetites
entice him, but abominable impiety seized upon the very citadel of the
mind, and pride penetrated to his inmost heart (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p31.1"></span>[Rom.
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31.1"></span>;
Book 4, chap. 15, sec. 10–12), so that it is foolish and unmeaning to
confine the corruption thence proceeding to what are called sensual
motions, or to call it an excitement, which allures, excites, and drags
the single part which they call sensuality into sin. Here Peter Lombard
has displayed gross ignorance (Lomb., lib. 2 Dist. 31). When
investigating the seat of corruption, he says it is in the flesh (as
Paul declares), not properly, indeed, but as being more apparent in the
flesh. As if Paul had meant that only a part of the soul, and not the
whole nature, was opposed to supernatural grace. Paul himself leaves no
room for doubt, when he says, that corruption does not dwell in one part
only, but that no part is free from its deadly taint. For, speaking of
corrupt nature, he not only condemns the inordinate nature of the
appetites, but, in particular, declares that the understanding is
subjected to blindness, and the heart to depravity (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p31.2"></span>[Eph. 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31.2"></span>.md).
The third chapter of the Epistle to the Romans is nothing but a
description of original sin; The same thing appears more clearly from
the mode of renovation. For the spirit, which is contrasted with the old
man, and the flesh, denotes not only the grace by which the sensual or
inferior part of the soul is corrected, but includes a complete
reformation of all its parts (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31.3"></span>[Eph.
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p31.3"></span>). And, accordingly, Paul enjoins not only
that gross appetites be suppressed, but that we be renewed in the spirit
of our mind (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31.4"></span>[Eph.
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p31.4"></span>), as he elsewhere tells us to be transformed
by the renewing of our mind (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31.5"></span>[Rom.
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p31.5"></span>). Hence it follows, that that part in which
the dignity and excellence of the soul are most conspicuous, has not
only been wounded, but so corrupted, that mere cure is not sufficient.
There must be a new nature. How far sin has seized both on the mind and
heart, we shall shortly see. Here I only wished briefly to observe, that
the whole man, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, is so
deluged, as it were, that no part remains exempt from sin, and,
therefore, everything which proceeds from him is imputed as sin. Thus
Paul says, that all carnal thoughts and affections are enmity against
God, and consequently death (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31.6"></span>[Rom.
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31.6"></span>.md).

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p32"></span>10. Let us have done, then, with those
who dare to inscribe the name of God on their vices, because we say that
men are born vicious. The divine workmanship, which they ought to look
for in the nature of Adam, when still entire and uncorrupted, they
absurdly expect to find in their depravity. The blame of our ruin rests
with our own carnality, not with God, its only cause being our
degeneracy from our original condition. And let no one here glamour that
God might have provided better for our safety by preventing Adam’s fall.
This objection, which, from the daring presumption implied in it, is
odious to every pious mind, relates to the mystery of predestination,
which will afterwards be considered in its own place (Tertull. de
Præscript., Calvin, Lib. de Predest). Meanwhile let us remember that our
ruin is attributable to our own depravity, that we may not insinuate a
charge against God himself, the Author of nature. It is true that nature
has received a mortal wound, but there is a great difference between a
wound inflicted from without, and one inherent in our first condition.
It is plain that this wound was inflicted by sin; and, therefore, we
have no ground of complaint except against ourselves. This is carefully
taught in Scripture. For the Preacher says, “Lo, this only have I found,
that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions,”
(<span id="iv.ii.ii-p32.1"></span>[Eccl.
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p32.1"></span>). Since man, by the kindness of God, was
made upright, but by his oven infatuation fell away unto vanity, his
destruction is obviously attributable only to himself (Athanas. in Orat.
Cont. Idola).

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p33"></span>11. We say, then, that man is corrupted
by a natural viciousness, but not by one which proceeded from nature. In
saying that it proceeded not from nature, we mean that it was rather an
adventitious event which befell man, than a substantial property
assigned to him from the beginning.15  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) We, however call it *natural* to
prevent any one from supposing that each individual contracts it by
depraved habit, whereas all receive it by a hereditary law. And we have
authority for so calling it. For, on the same grounds the apostle says,
that we are “by nature the children of wrath,” (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p34.1"></span>[Eph.
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p34.1"></span>.md).
How could God, who takes pleasure in the meanest of his works be
offended with the noblest of them all? The offence is not with the work
itself, but the corruption of the work. Wherefore, if it is not improper
to say, that, in consequence of the corruption of human nature, man is
naturally hateful to God, it is not improper to say, that he is
naturally vicious and depraved. Hence, in the view of our corrupt
nature, Augustine hesitates not to call those sins natural which
necessarily reign in the flesh wherever the grace of God is wanting.
This disposes of the absurd notion of the Manichees, who, imagining that
man was essentially wicked, went the length of assigning him a different
Creator, that they might thus avoid the appearance of attributing the
cause and origin of evil to a righteous God.
