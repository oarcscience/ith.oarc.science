### <span id="iv.iii.xvii-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 16.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p1"></span>REFUTATION OF THE CALUMNIES BY WHICH IT
IS ATTEMPTED TO THROW ODIUM ON THIS DOCTRINE.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p2"></span>The divisions of this chapter are,—I.
The calumnies of the Papists against the orthodox doctrine of
Justification by Faith are reduced to two classes. The first class, with
its consequences, refuted, sec. 1-3. II. The second class, which is
dependent on the first, refuted in the last section.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p3"></span>*Sections*.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p4"></span>1. Calumnies of the Papists. 1. That we
destroy good works, and give encouragement to sin. Refutation of the
first calumny. 1. Character of those who censure us. 2. Justification by
faith establishes the necessity of good works.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p5"></span>2. Refutation of a consequent of the
former calumny—viz. that men are dissuaded from well-doing when we
destroy merit. Two modes of refutation. First mode confirmed by many
invincible arguments.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p6"></span>3. The Apostles make no mention of
merit, when they exhort us to good works. On the contrary, excluding
merit, they refer us entirely to the mercy of God. Another mode of
refutation.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p7"></span>4. Refutation of the second calumny and
of an inference from it,—viz. that the obtaining righteousness is made
too easy, when it is made to consist in the free remission of sins.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p8"></span>1. Our last sentence may refute the
impudent calumny of certain ungodly men, who charge us, first, with
destroying good works and leading men away from the study of them, when
we say, that men are not justified, and do not merit salvation by works;
and, secondly, with making the means of justification too easy, when we
say that it consists in the free remission of sins, and thus alluring
men to sin to which they are already too much inclined. These calumnies,
I say, are sufficiently refuted by that one sentence; however, I will
briefly reply to both. The allegation is that justification by faith
destroys good works. I will not describe what kind of zealots for good
works the persons are who thus charge us. We leave them as much liberty
to bring the charge, as they take license to taint the whole world with
the pollution of their lives.43  <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md)
They pretend to lament43  <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) that
when faith is so highly extolled, works are deprived of their proper
place. But what if they are rather ennobled and established? We dream
not of a faith which is devoid of good works, nor of a justification
which can exist without them: the only difference is, that while we
acknowledge that faith and works are necessarily connected, we, however,
place justification in faith, not in works. How this is done is easily
explained, if we turn to Christ only, to whom our faith is directed and
from whom it derives all its power. Why, then, are we justified by
faith? Because by faith we apprehend the righteousness of Christ, which
alone reconciles us to God. This faith, however, you cannot apprehend
without at the same time apprehending sanctification; for Christ “is
made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
redemption,” (<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p10.1"></span>[1 Cor.
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvii-p10.1"></span>). Christ, therefore, justifies no man
without also sanctifying him. These blessings are conjoined by a
perpetual and inseparable tie. Those whom he enlightens by his wisdom he
redeems; whom he redeems he justifies; whom he justifies he sanctifies.
But as the question relates only to justification and sanctification, to
them let us confine ourselves. Though we distinguish between them, they
are both inseparably comprehended in Christ. Would ye then obtain
justification in Christ? You must previously possess Christ. But you
cannot possess him without being made a partaker of his sanctification:
for Christ cannot be divided. Since the Lord, therefore, does not grant
us the enjoyment of these blessings without bestowing himself, he
bestows both at once but never the one without the other. Thus it
appears how true it is that we are justified not without, and yet not by
works, since in the participation of Christ, by which we are justified,
is contained not less sanctification than justification.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p11"></span>2. It is also most untrue that men’s
minds are withdrawn from the desire of well-doing when we deprive them
of the idea of merit. Here, by the way, the reader must be told that
those men absurdly infer merit from reward, as I will afterwards more
clearly explain. They thus infer, because ignorant of the principle that
God gives no less a display of his liberality when he assigns reward to
works, than when he bestows the faculty of well-doing. This topic it
will be better to defer to its own place. At present, let it be
sufficient merely to advert to the weakness of their objection. This may
be done in two ways.44  <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) For,
*first*, they are altogether in error when they say that, unless a hope
of reward is held forth, no regard will be had to the right conduct of
life. For if all that men do when they serve God is to look to the
reward, and hire out or sell their labour to him, little is gained: he
desires to be freely worshipped, freely loved: I say he approves the
worshipper who, even if all hope of reward were cut off, would cease not
to worship him. Moreover, when men are to be urged, there cannot be a
stronger stimulus than that derived from the end of our redemption and
calling, such as the word of God employs when it says, that it were the
height of impiety and ingratitude not to “love him who first loved us;”
that by “the blood of Christ” our conscience is purged “from dead works
to serve the living God;” that it were impious sacrilege in any one to
count “the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy
thing;” that we have been “delivered out of the hands of our enemies,”
that we “might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness
before him, all the days of our life;” that being “made free from sin,”
we “become the servants of righteousness;” “that our old man is
crucified with him,” in order that we might rise to newness of life.
Again, “if ye then be risen with Christ (as becomes his members), seek
those things which are above,” living as pilgrims in the world, and
aspiring to heaven, where our treasure is. “The grace of God has
appeared to all men, bringing salvation, teaching us that, denying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the
glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ.” “For
God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our
Lord Jesus Christ.” “Know ye not that ye are the temples of the Holy
Spirit,” which it were impious to profane? “Ye were sometimes darkness,
but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as the children of light.” “God
has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.” “For this is the
will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain” from all
illicit desires: ours is a “holy calling,” and we respond not to it
except by purity of life. “Being then made free from sin, ye became the
servants of righteousness.” Can there be a stronger argument in
eliciting us to charity than that of John? “If God so loved us, we ought
also to love one another.” “In this the children of God are manifest,
and the children of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness is not
of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.” Similar is the argument
of Paul, “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?” “For
as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that
one body being many, are one body, so also is Christ.” Can there be a
stronger incentive to holiness than when we are told by John, “Every man
that has this hope in him purifieth himself; even as he is pure?” and by
Paul, “Having, therefore, these promises, dearly beloved, cleanse
yourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit;” or when we hear
our Savior hold forth himself as an example to us that we should follow
his steps?44  <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md)

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p14"></span>3. I have given these few passages
merely as a specimen; for were I to go over them all, I should form a
large volume. All the Apostles abound in exhortations, admonitions and
rebukes, for the purpose of training the man of God to every good work,
and that without any mention of merit. Nay, rather their chief
exhortations are founded on the fact, that without any merit of ours,
our salvation depends entirely on the mercy of God. Thus Paul, who
during a whole Epistle had maintained that there was no hope of life for
us save in the righteousness of Christ, when he comes to exhortations
beseeches us by the mercy which God has bestowed upon us (<span
id="iv.iii.xvii-p14.1"></span>[Rom.
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvii-p14.1"></span>). Andy indeed this one reason ought to
have been sufficient, that God may be glorified in us. But if any are
not so ardently desirous to promote the glory of God, still the
remembrance of his kindness is most sufficient to incite them to do good
(see Chrysost. Homily. in Genes). But those men,44  <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) because, by introducing the idea of
merit, they perhaps extract some forced and servile obedience of the
Law, falsely allege, that as we do not adopt the same course, we have no
means of exhorting to good works. As if God were well pleased with such
services when he declares that he loves a cheerful giver, and forbids
any thing to be given him grudgingly or of necessity (<span
id="iv.iii.xvii-p15.1"></span>[2 Cor.
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvii-p15.1"></span>). I say not that I would reject that or
omit any kind of exhortation which Scripture employs, its object being
not to leave any method of animating us untried. For it states, that the
recompense which God will render to every one is *according to his
deeds*; but, first, I deny that that is the only, or, in many instances,
the principal motive; and, secondly, I admit not that it is the motive
with which we are to begin. Moreover, I maintain that it gives not the
least countenance to those merits which these men are always preaching.
This will afterwards be seen. Lastly, there is no use in this
recompense, unless we have previously embraced the doctrine that we are
justified solely by the merits of Christ as apprehended by faith, and
not by any merit of works; because the study of piety can be fitly
prosecuted only by those by whom this doctrine has been previously
imbibed. This is beautifully intimated by the Psalmist when he thus
addresses God, “There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
feared,” (<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p15.2"></span>[Ps.
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvii-p15.2"></span>). For he shows that the worship of God
cannot exist without acknowledging his mercy, on which it is founded and
established. This is specially deserving of notice, as showing us not
only that the beginning of the due worship of God is confidence in his
mercy; but that the fear of God (which Papists will have to be
meritorious) cannot be entitled to the name of merit, for this reason,
that it is founded on the pardon and remission of sins.

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p16"></span>4. But the most futile calumny of all
is, that men are invited to sin when we affirm that the pardon in which
we hold that justification consists is gratuitous. Our doctrine is, that
justification is a thing of such value, that it cannot be put into the
balance with any good quality of ours; and, therefore, could never be
obtained unless it were gratuitous: moreover, that it is gratuitous to
us, but not also to Christ, who paid so dearly for it; namely his own
most sacred blood, out of which there was no price of sufficient value
to pay what was due to the justice of God. When men are thus taught they
are reminded that it is owing to no merit of theirs that the shedding of
that most sacred blood is not repeated every time they sin. Moreover, we
say that our pollution is so great, that it can never be washed away
save in the fountain of his pure blood. Must not those who are thus
addressed conceive a greater horror of sin than if it were said to be
wiped off by a sprinkling of good works? If they have any reverence for
God, how can they, after being once purified, avoid shuddering at the
thought of again wallowing in the mire, and as much as in them lies
troubling and polluting the purity of this fountain? “I have washed my
feet,” (says the believing soul in the Song of Solomon, 5:3), “how shall
I defile them?” It is now plain which of the two makes the forgiveness
of sins of less value, and derogates from the dignity of justification.
They pretend that God is appeased by their frivolous satisfactions; in
other words, by mere dross. We maintain that the guilt of sin is too
heinous to be so frivolously expiated; that the offense is too grave to
be forgiven to such valueless satisfactions; and, therefore, that
forgiveness is the prerogative of Christ’s blood alone. They say that
righteousness, wherever it is defective, is renewed and repaired by
works of satisfaction. We think it too precious to be balanced by any
compensation of works, and, therefore, in order to restore it, recourse
must be had solely to the mercy of God. For the other points relating to
the forgiveness of sins, see the following chapter.
