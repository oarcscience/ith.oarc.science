### <span id="iv.i.xvi-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 15.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p1"></span>STATE IN WHICH MAN WAS CREATED. THE
FACULTIES OF THE SOUL—THE IMAGE OF GOD—FREE WILL—ORIGINAL RIGHTEOUSNESS.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p2"></span>This chapter is thus divided:—I. The
necessary rules to be observed in considering the state of man before
the fall being laid down, the point first considered is the creation of
the body, and the lesson taught by its being formed out of the earth,
and made alive, sec. 1. II. The immortality of the human soul is proved
by various solid arguments, sec. 2. III. The image of God (the strongest
proof of the soul’s immortality) is considered, and various absurd
fancies are refuted, sec. 3. IV. Several errors which obscure the light
of truth being dissipated, follows a philosophical and theological
consideration of the faculties of the soul before the fall.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p3"></span>*Sections.*

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p4"></span>1. A twofold knowledge of God—viz. before
the fall and after it. The former here considered. Particular rules or
precautions to be observed in this discussion. What we are taught by a
body formed ant of the dust, and tenanted by a spirit.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p5"></span>2. The immortality of the soul proved
from, 1. The testimony of conscience. 2. The knowledge of God. 3. The
noble faculties with which it is endued. 4. Its activity and wondrous
fancies in sleep. 5. Innumerable passages of Scripture.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p6"></span>3. The image of God one of the strongest
proofs of the immortality of the soul. What meant by this image. The
dreams of Osiander concerning the image of God refuted. Whether any
difference between “image” and “likeness.” Another objection of Osiander
refuted. The image of God conspicuous in the whole Adam.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p7"></span>4. The image of God is in the soul. Its
nature may be learnt from its renewal by Christ. What comprehended under
this renewal. What the image of God in man before the fall. In what
things it now appears. When and where it will be seen in perfection.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p8"></span>5. The dreams of the Manichees and of
Servetus, as to the origin of the soul, refuted. Also of Osiander, who
denies that there is any image of God in man without essential
righteousness.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p9"></span>6. The doctrine of philosophers as to the
faculties of the soul generally discordant, doubtful, and obscure. The
excellence of the soul described. Only one soul in each man. A brief
review of the opinion of philosophers as to the faculties of the soul.
What to be thought of this opinion.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p10"></span>7. The division of the faculties of the
soul into intellect and will, more agreeable to Christian doctrine.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p11"></span>8. The power and office of the intellect
and will in man before the fall. Man’s free will. This freedom lost by
the fall—a fact unknown to philosophers. The delusion of Pelagians and
Papists. Objection as to the fall of man when free, refuted.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p12"></span>1. We have now to speak of the creation
of man, not only because of all the works of God it is the noblest, and
most admirable specimen of his justice, wisdom, and goodness, but, as we
observed at the outset, we cannot clearly and properly know God unless
the knowledge of ourselves be added. This knowledge is
twofold,—relating, first, to the condition in which we were at first
created; and, secondly to our condition such as it began to be
immediately after Adam’s fall. For it would little avail us to know how
we were created if we remained ignorant of the corruption and
degradation of our nature in consequence of the fall. At present,
however, we confine ourselves to a consideration of our nature in its
original integrity. And, certainly, before we descend to the miserable
condition into which man has fallen, it is of importance to consider
what he was at first. For there is need of caution, lest we attend only
to the natural ills of man, and thereby seem to ascribe them to the
Author of nature; impiety deeming it a sufficient defence if it can
pretend that everything vicious in it proceeded in some sense from God,
and not hesitating, when accused, to plead against God, and throw the
blame of its guilt upon Him. Those who would be thought to speak more
reverently of the Deity catch at an excuse for their depravity from
nature, not considering that they also, though more obscurely, bring a
charge against God, on whom the dishonour would fall if anything vicious
were proved to exist in nature. Seeing, therefore, that the flesh is
continually on the alert for subterfuges, by which it imagines it can
remove the blame of its own wickedness from itself to some other
quarter, we must diligently guard against this depraved procedure, and
accordingly treat of the calamity of the human race in such a way as may
cut off every evasion, and vindicate the justice of God against all who
would impugn it. We shall afterwards see, in its own place (Book 2 chap.
1 sec. 3), how far mankind now are from the purity originally conferred
on Adam. And, first, it is to be observed, that when he was formed out
of the dust of the ground a curb was laid on his pride—nothing being
more absurd than that those should glory in their excellence who not
only dwell in tabernacles of clay, but are themselves in part dust and
ashes. But God having not only deigned to animate a vessel of clay, but
to make it the habitation of an immortal spirit, Adam might well glory
in the great liberality of his Maker.12  <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p14"></span>2. Moreover, there can be no question
that man consists of a body and a soul; meaning by soul, an immortal
though created essence, which is his nobler part. Sometimes he is called
a spirit. But though the two terms, while they are used together differ
in their meaning, still, when spirit is used by itself it is equivalent
to soul, as when Solomon speaking of death says, that the spirit returns
to God who gave it (<span id="iv.i.xvi-p14.1"></span>[Eccles.
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p14.1"></span>). And Christ, in commending his spirit to
the Father, and Stephen his to Christ, simply mean, that when the soul
is freed from the prison-house of the body, God becomes its perpetual
keeper. Those who imagine that the soul is called a spirit because it is
a breath or energy divinely infused into bodies, but devoid of essence,
err too grossly, as is shown both by the nature of the thing, and the
whole tenor of Scripture. It is true, indeed, that men cleaving too much
to the earth are dull of apprehension, nay, being alienated from the
Father of Lights, are so immersed in darkness as to imagine that they
will not survive the grave; still the light is not so completely
quenched in darkness that all sense of immortality is lost. Conscience,
which, distinguishing, between good and evil, responds to the Judgment
of God, is an undoubted sign of an immortal spirit. How could motion
devoid of essence penetrate to the Judgment-seat of God, and under a
sense of guilt strike itself with terror? The body cannot be affected by
any fear of spiritual punishment. This is competent only to the soul,
which must therefore be endued with essence. Then the mere knowledge of
a God sufficiently proves that souls which rise higher than the world
must be immortal, it being impossible that any evanescent vigour could
reach the very fountain of life. In fine, while the many noble faculties
with which the human mind is endued proclaim that something divine is
engraven on it, they are so many evidences of an immortal essence. For
such sense as the lower animals possess goes not beyond the body, or at
least not beyond the objects actually presented to it. But the swiftness
with which the human mind glances from heaven to earth, scans the
secrets of nature, and, after it has embraced all ages, with intellect
and memory digests each in its proper order, and reads the future in the
past, clearly demonstrates that there lurks in man a something separated
from the body. We have intellect by which we are able to conceive of the
invisible God and angels—a thing of which body is altogether incapable.
We have ideas of rectitude, justice, and honesty—ideas which the bodily
senses cannot reach. The seat of these ideas must therefore be a spirit.
Nay, sleep itself, which stupefying the man, seems even to deprive him
of life, is no obscure evidence of immortality; not only suggesting
thoughts of things which never existed, but foreboding future events. I
briefly touch on topics which even profane writers describe with a more
splendid eloquence. For pious readers, a simple reference is sufficient.
Were not the soul some kind of essence separated from the body,
Scripture would not teach12  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)
that we dwell in houses of clay, and at death remove from a tabernacle
of flesh; that we put off that which is corruptible, in order that, at
the last day, we may finally receive according to the deeds done in the
body. These, and similar passages which everywhere occur, not only
clearly distinguish the soul from the body, but by giving it the name of
man, intimate that it is his principal part. Again, when Paul exhorts
believers to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and the
spirit, he shows that there are two parts in which the taint of sin
resides. Peter, also, in calling Christ the Shepherd and Bishop of
souls, would have spoken absurdly if there were no souls towards which
he might discharge such an office. Nor would there be any ground for
what he says concerning the eternal salvation of souls, or for his
injunction to purify our souls, or for his assertion that fleshly lusts
war against the soul; neither could the author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews say, that pastors watch as those who must give an account for
our souls, if souls were devoid of essence. To the same effect Paul
calls God to witness upon his soul, which could not be brought to trial
before God if incapable of suffering punishment. This is still more
clearly expressed by our Saviour, when he bids us fear him who, after he
has killed the body, is able also to cast into hell fire. Again when the
author of the Epistle to the Hebrews distinguishes the fathers of our
flesh from God, who alone is the Father of our spirits, he could not
have asserted the essence of the soul in clearer terms. Moreover, did
not the soul, when freed from the fetters of the body, continue to
exist, our Saviour would not have represented the soul of Lazarus as
enjoying blessedness in Abraham s bosom, while, on the contrary, that of
Dives was suffering dreadful torments. Paul assures us of the same thing
when he says, that so long as we are present in the body, we are absent
from the Lord. Not to dwell on a matter as to which there is little
obscurity, I will only add, that Luke mentions among the errors of the
Sadducees that they believed neither angel nor spirit.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p16"></span>3. A strong proof of this point may be
gathered from its being said, that man was created in the image of God.
For though the divine glory is displayed in man’s outward appearance, it
cannot be doubted that the proper seat of the image is in the soul. I
deny not, indeed, that external shape, in so far as it distinguishes and
separates us from the lower animals, brings us nearer to God; nor will I
vehemently oppose any who may choose to include under the image of God
that

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p17"></span>“While the mute creation downward bend

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p18"></span>Their sight, and to their earthly mother
tend,

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p19"></span>Man looks aloft, and with erected eyes,

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p20"></span>Beholds his own hereditary skies.”12
 <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p22"></span>Only let it be understood, that the image
of God which is beheld or made conspicuous by these external marks, is
spiritual. For Osiander (whose writings exhibit a perverse ingenuity in
futile devices), extending the image of God indiscriminately as well to
the body as to the soul, confounds heaven with earth. He says, that the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, placed their image in man,
because, even though Adam had stood entire, Christ would still have
become man. Thus, according to him, the body which was destined for
Christ was a model and type of that corporeal figure which was then
formed. But where does he find that Christ is an image of the Spirit? I
admit, indeed, that in the person of the Mediator, the glory of the
whole Godhead is displayed: but how can the eternal Word, who in order
precedes the Spirit, be called his image? In short, the distinction
between the Son and the Spirit is destroyed when the former is
represented as the image of the latter. Moreover, I should like to know
in what respect Christ in the flesh in which he was clothed resembles
the Holy Spirit, and by what marks, or lineaments, the likeness is
expressed. And since the expression, “Let us make man in our own image,”
is used in the person of the Son also, it follows that he is the image
of himself—a thing utterly absurd. Add that, according to the figment of
Osiander,12  <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) Adam was formed
after the model or type of the man Christ. Hence Christ, in as much as
he was to be clothed with flesh, was the idea according to which Adam
was formed, whereas the Scriptures teach very differently—viz. that he
was formed in the image of God. There is more plausibility in the
imagination of those who interpret that Adam was created in the image of
God, because it was conformable to Christ, who is the only image of God;
but not even for this is there any solid foundation. The “image” and
“likeness” has given rise to no small discussion; interpreters searching
without cause for a difference between the two terms, since “likeness”
is merely added by way of exposition. First, we know that repetitions
are common in Hebrew, which often gives two words for one thing; And,
secondly, there is no ambiguity in the thing itself, man being called
the image of God because of his likeness to God. Hence there is an
obvious absurdity in those who indulge in philosophical speculation as
to these names, placing the *Zelem*, that is the image, in the substance
of the soul, and the *Demuth*, that is the likeness, in its qualities,
and so forth. God having determined to create man in his own image, to
remove the obscurity which was in this terms adds, by way of
explanation, in *his likeness*, as if he had said, that he would make
man, in whom he would, as it were, image himself by means of the marks
of resemblance impressed upon him. Accordingly, Moses, shortly after
repeating the account, puts down the image of God twice, and makes no
mention of the likeness. Osiander frivolously objects that it is not a
part of the man, or the soul with its faculties, which is called the
image of God, but the whole Adam, who received his name from the dust
out of which he was taken. I call the objection frivolous, as all sound
readers will judge. For though the whole man is called mortal, the soul
is not therefore liable to death, nor when he is called a rational
animal is reason or intelligence thereby attributed to the body. Hence,
although the soul is not the man, there is no absurdity in holding that
he is called the image of God in respect of the soul; though I retain
the principle which I lately laid down, that the image of God extends to
everything in which the nature of man surpasses that of all other
species of animals. Accordingly, by this term is denoted the integrity
with which Adam was endued when his intellect was clear, his affections
subordinated to reason, all his senses duly regulated, and when he truly
ascribed all his excellence to the admirable gifts of his Maker. And
though the primary seat of the divine image was in the mind and the
heart, or in the soul and its powers, there was no part even of the body
in which some rays of glory did not shine. It is certain that in every
part of the world some lineaments of divine glory are beheld and hence
we may infer, that when his image is placed in man, there is a kind of
tacit antithesis, as it were, setting man apart from the crowd, and
exalting him above all the other creatures. But it cannot be denied that
the angels also were created in the likeness of God, since, as Christ
declares (<span id="iv.i.xvi-p23.2"></span>[Mt.
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p23.2"></span>), our highest perfection will consist in
being like them. But it is not without good cause that Moses commends
the favour of God towards us by giving us this peculiar title, the more
especially that he was only comparing man with the visible creation.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p24"></span>4. But our definition of the image seems
not to be complete until it appears more clearly what the faculties are
in which man excels, and in which he is to be regarded as a mirror of
the divine glory. This, however, cannot be better known than from the
remedy provided for the corruption of nature. It cannot be doubted that
when Adam lost his first estate he became alienated from God. Wherefore,
although we grant that the image of God was not utterly effaced and
destroyed in him, it was, however, so corrupted, that any thing which
remains is fearful deformity; and, therefore, our deliverance begins
with that renovation which we obtain from Christ, who is, therefore,
called the second Adam, because he restores us to true and substantial
integrity. For although Paul, contrasting the quickening Spirit which
believers receive from Christ, with the living soul which Adam was
created (<span id="iv.i.xvi-p24.1"></span>[1 Cor.
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md)<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p24.1"></span>), commends the richer measure of grace
bestowed in regeneration, he does not, however, contradict the
statement, that the end of regeneration is to form us anew in the image
of God. Accordingly, he elsewhere shows that the new man is renewed
after the image of him that created him (<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p24.2"></span>[Col.
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p24.2"></span>). To this corresponds another passage, “Put
ye on the new man, who after God is created,” (<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p24.3"></span>[Eph.
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p24.3"></span>). We must now see what particulars Paul
comprehends under this renovation. In the first place, he mentions
knowledge, and in the second, true righteousness and holiness. Hence we
infer, that at the beginning the image of God was manifested by light of
intellect, rectitude of heart, and the soundness of every part. For
though I admit that the forms of expression are elliptical, this
principle cannot be overthrown—viz. that the leading feature in the
renovation of the divine image must also have held the highest place in
its creation. To the same effect Paul elsewhere says, that beholding the
glory of Christ with unveiled face, we are transformed into the same
image. We now see how Christ is the most perfect image of God, into
which we are so renewed as to bear the image of God in knowledge,
purity, righteousness, and true holiness. This being established, the
imagination of Osiander, as to bodily form, vanishes of its own accord.
As to that passage of St Paul (<span id="iv.i.xvi-p24.4"></span>[1 Cor.
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p24.4"></span>), in which the man alone to the express
exclusion of the woman, is called the image and glory of God, it is
evident from the context, that it merely refers to civil order. I
presume it has already been sufficiently proved, that the image
comprehends everything which has any relation to the spiritual and
eternal life. The same thing, in different terms, is declared by St John
when he says, that the light which was from the beginning, in the
eternal Word of God, was the light of man (<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p24.5"></span>[John
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)<span id="iv.i.xvi-p24.5"></span>.md).
His object being to extol the singular grace of God in making man excel
the other animals, he at the same time shows how he was formed in the
image of God, that he may separate him from the common herd, as
possessing not ordinary animal existence, but one which combines with it
the light of intelligence. Therefore, as the image of God constitutes
the entire excellence of human nature, as it shone in Adam before his
fall, but was afterwards vitiated and almost destroyed, nothing
remaining but a ruin, confused, mutilated, and tainted with impurity, so
it is now partly seen in the elect, in so far as they are regenerated by
the Spirit. Its full lustre, however, will be displayed in heaven. But
in order to know the particular properties in which it consists, it will
be proper to treat of the faculties of the soul. For there is no
solidity in Augustine’s speculation,12  <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) that the soul is a mirror of the
Trinity, inasmuch as it comprehends within itself, intellect, will, and
memory. Nor is there probability in the opinion of those who place
likeness to God in the dominion bestowed upon man, as if he only
resembled God in this, that he is appointed lord and master of all
things. The likeness must be within, in himself. It must be something
which is not external to him but is properly the internal good of the
soul.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p26"></span>5. But before I proceed further, it is
necessary to advert to the dream of the Manichees, which Servetus has
attempted in our day to revive. Because it is said that God breathed
into man’s nostrils the breath of life (<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p26.1"></span>[Gen.
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007)<span id="iv.i.xvi-p26.1"></span>.md),
they thought that the soul was a transmission of the substance of God;
as if some portion of the boundless divinity had passed into man. It
cannot take long time to show how many gross and foul absurdities this
devilish error carries in its train. For if the soul of man is a portion
transmitted from the essence of God, the divine nature must not only be
liable to passion and change, but also to ignorance, evil desires,
infirmity, and all kinds of vice. There is nothing more inconstant than
man, contrary movements agitating and distracting his soul. He is ever
and anon deluded by want of skill, and overcome by the slightest
temptations; while every one feels that the soul itself is a receptacle
for all kinds of pollution. All these things must be attributed to the
divine nature, if we hold that the soul is of the essence of God, or a
secret influx of divinity. Who does not shudder at a thing so monstrous?
Paul, indeed, quoting from Aratus, tells us we are his offspring (<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p26.2"></span>[Acts
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p26.2"></span>); not in substance, however, but in quality,
in as much as he has adorned us with divine endowments. Meanwhile, to
lacerate the essence of the Creator, in order to assign a portion to
each individual, is the height of madness. It must, therefore, be held
as certain, that souls, notwithstanding of their having the divine image
engraven on them, are created just as angels are. Creation, however, is
not a transfusion of essence,12  <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md)
but a commencement of it out of nothing. Nor, though the spirit is given
by God, and when it quits the flesh again returns to him, does it follow
that it is a portion withdrawn from his essence.12  <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) Here, too, Osiander, carried away by
his illusions entangled himself in an impious error, by denying that the
image of God could be in man without his essential righteousness; as if
God were unable, by the mighty power of his Spirit, to render us
conformable to himself, unless Christ were substantially transfused into
us. Under whatever colour some attempt to gloss these delusions, they
can never so blind the eyes of intelligent readers as to prevent them
from discerning in them a revival of Manicheism. But from the words of
Paul, when treating of the renewal of the image (<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p28.1"></span>[2 Cor.
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.i.xvi-p28.1"></span>), the inference is obvious, that man was
conformable to God, not by an influx of substance, but by the grace and
virtue of the Spirit. He says, that by beholding the glory of Christ, we
are transformed into the same image as by the Spirit of the Lord; and
certainly the Spirit does not work in us so as to make us of the same
substance with God.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p29"></span>6. It were vain to seek a definition of
the soul from philosophers, not one of whom, with the exception of
Plato, distinctly maintained its immortality. Others of the school of
Socrates, indeed, lean the same way, but still without teaching
distinctly a doctrine of which they were not fully persuaded. Plato,
however, advanced still further, and regarded the soul as an image of
God. Others so attach its powers and faculties to the present life, that
they leave nothing external to the body. Moreover, having already shown
from Scripture that the substance of the soul is incorporeal, we must
now add, that though it is not properly enclosed by space, it however
occupies the body as a kind of habitation, not only animating all its
parts, and rendering the organs fit and useful for their actions, but
also holding the first place in regulating the conduct. This it does not
merely in regard to the offices of a terrestrial life, but also in
regard to the service of God. This, though not clearly seen in our
corrupt state, yet the impress of its remains is seen in our very vices.
For whence have men such a thirst for glory but from a sense of shame?
And whence this sense of shame but from a respect for what is
honourable? Of this, the first principle and source is a consciousness
that they were born to cultivate righteousness,—a consciousness akin to
religion. But as man was undoubtedly created to meditate on the heavenly
life, so it is certain that the knowledge of it was engraven on the
soul. And, indeed, man would want the principal use of his understanding
if he were unable to discern his felicity, the perfection of which
consists in being united to God. Hence, the principal action of the soul
is to aspire thither, and, accordingly, the more a man studies to
approach to God, the more he proves himself to be endued with reason.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p30"></span>Though there is some plausibility in the
opinion of those who maintain that man has more than one soul, namely, a
sentient and a rational, yet as there is no soundness in their
arguments, we must reject it, unless we would torment ourselves with
things frivolous and useless. They tell us (see chap. 5 sec. 4), there
is a great repugnance between organic movements and the rational part of
the soul. As if reason also were not at variance with herself, and her
counsels sometimes conflicting with each other like hostile armies. But
since this disorder results from the depravation of nature, it is
erroneous to infer that there are two souls, because the faculties do
not accord so harmoniously as they ought. But I leave it to philosophers
to discourse more subtilely of these faculties. For the edification of
the pious, a simple definition will be sufficient. I admit, indeed, that
what they ingeniously teach on the subject is true, and not only
pleasant, but also useful to be known; nor do I forbid any who are
inclined to prosecute the study. First, I admit that there are five
senses, which Plato (in Theæteto) prefers calling organs, by which all
objects are brought into a common sensorium, as into a kind of
receptacle:12  <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) Next comes the
imagination (*phantasia*), which distinguishes between the objects
brought into the sensorium: Next, reason, to which the general power of
Judgment belongs: And, lastly, intellect, which contemplates with fixed
and quiet look whatever reason discursively revolves. In like manner,12
 <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) to intellect, fancy, and
reason, the three cognitive faculties of the soul, correspond three
appetite faculties—viz. will—whose office is to choose whatever reason
and intellect propound; irascibility, which seizes on what is set before
it by reason and fancy; and concupiscence, which lays hold of the
objects presented by sense and fancy.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p33"></span>Though these things are true, or at least
plausible, still, as I fear they are more fitted to entangle, by their
obscurity, than to assist us, I think it best to omit them. If any one
chooses to distribute the powers of the mind in a different manner,
calling one appetive, which, though devoid of reason, yet obeys reason,
if directed from a different quarter, and another intellectual, as being
by itself participant of reason, I have no great objection. Nor am I
disposed to quarrel with the view, that there are three principles of
action—viz. sense, intellect, and appetite. But let us rather adopt a
division adapted to all capacities—a thing which certainly is not to be
obtained from philosophers. For they,12  <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) when they would speak most plainly,
divide the soul into appetite and intellect, but make both double. To
the latter they sometimes give the name of *contemplative*, as being
contented with mere knowledge and having no active powers (which
circumstance makes Cicero designate it by the name of intellect,
*ingenii*) (De Fin. lib. 5). At other times they give it the name of
*practical*, because it variously moves the will by the apprehension of
good or evil. Under this class is included the art of living well and
justly. The former—viz. appetite—they divide into will and
concupiscence, calling it βούλεσις, so whenever the appetite, which they
call ὁρμή, obeys the reason. But when appetite, casting off the yoke of
reason, runs to intemperance, they call it πάτηος. Thus they always
presuppose in man a reason by which he is able to guide himself aright.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p35"></span>7. From this method of teaching we are
forced somewhat to dissent. For philosophers, being unacquainted with
the corruption of nature, which is the punishment of revolt, erroneously
confound two states of man which are very different from each other. Let
us therefore hold, for the purpose of the present work, that the soul
consists of two parts, the intellect and the will (Book 2 chap. 2 sec.
2, 12),—the office of the intellect being to distinguish between
objects, according as they seem deserving of being approved or
disapproved; and the office of the will, to choose and follow what the
intellect declares to be good, to reject and shun what it declares to be
bad (Plato, in Phædro). We dwell not on the subtlety of Aristotle, that
the mind has no motion of itself; but that the moving power is choice,
which he also terms the appetite intellect. Not to lose ourselves in
superfluous questions, let it be enough to know that the intellect is to
us, as it were, the guide and ruler of the soul; that the will always
follows its beck, and waits for its decision, in matters of desire. For
which reason Aristotle truly taught, that in the appetite there is a
pursuit and rejection corresponding in some degree to affirmation and
negation in the intellect (Aristot. Ethic. lib. 6 sec. 2). Moreover, it
will be seen in another place (Book 2 c. 2 see. 12-26), how surely the
intellect governs the will. Here we only wish to observe, that the soul
does not possess any faculty which may not be duly referred to one or
other of these members. And in this way we comprehend sense under
intellect. Others distinguish thus: They say that sense inclines to
pleasure in the same way as the intellect to good; that hence the
appetite of sense becomes concupiscence and lust, while the affection of
the intellect becomes will. For the term appetite, which they prefer, I
use that of will, as being more common.

<span id="iv.i.xvi-p36"></span>8. Therefore, God has provided the soul
of man with intellect, by which he might discern good from evil, just
from unjust, and might know what to follow or to shun, reason going
before with her lamp; whence philosophers, in reference to her directing
power, have called her τὸ ἑγεμονικὸν. To this he has joined will, to
which choice belongs. Man excelled in these noble endowments in his
primitive condition, when reason, intelligence, prudence, and Judgment,
not only sufficed for the government of his earthly life, but also
enabled him to rise up to God and eternal happiness. Thereafter choice
was added to direct the appetites, and temper all the organic motions;
the will being thus perfectly submissive to the authority of reason. In
this upright state, man possessed freedom of will, by which, if he
chose, he was able to obtain eternal life. It were here unseasonable to
introduce the question concerning the secret predestination of God,
because we are not considering what might or might not happen, but what
the nature of man truly was. Adam, therefore, might have stood if he
chose, since it was only by his own will that he fell; but it was
because his will was pliable in either directions and he had not
received constancy to persevere, that he so easily fell. Still he had a
free choice of good and evil; and not only so, but in the mind and will
there was the highest rectitude, and all the organic parts were duly
framed to obedience, until man corrupted its good properties, and
destroyed himself. Hence the great darkness of philosophers who have
looked for a complete building in a ruin, and fit arrangement in
disorder. The principle they set out with was, that man could not be a
rational animal unless he had a free choice of good and evil. They also
imagined that the distinction between virtue and vice was destroyed, if
man did not of his own counsel arrange his life. So far well, had there
been no change in man. This being unknown to them, it is not surprising
that they throw every thing into confusion. But those who, while they
profess to be the disciples of Christ, still seek for free-will in man,
notwithstanding of his being lost and drowned in spiritual destruction,
labour under manifold delusion, making a heterogeneous mixture of
inspired doctrine and philosophical opinions, and so erring as to both.
But it will be better to leave these things to their own place (see Book
2 chap. 2) At present it is necessary only to remember, that man, at his
first creation, was very different from all his posterity; who, deriving
their origin from him after he was corrupted, received a hereditary
taint. At first every part of the soul was formed to rectitude. There
was soundness of mind and freedom of will to choose the good. If any one
objects that it was placed, as it were, in a slippery position, because
its power was weak, I answer, that the degree conferred was sufficient
to take away every excuse. For surely the Deity could not be tied down
to this condition,—to make man such, that he either could not or would
not sin. Such a nature might have been more excellent;13  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) but to expostulate with God as if he
had been bound to confer this nature on man, is more than unjust, seeing
he had full right to determine how much or how little He would give. Why
He did not sustain him by the virtue of perseverance is hidden in his
counsel; it is ours to keep within the bounds of soberness. Man had
received the power, if he had the will, but he had not the will which
would have given the power; for this will would have been followed by
perseverance. Still, after he had received so much, there is no excuse
for his having spontaneously brought death upon himself. No necessity
was laid upon God to give him more than that intermediate and even
transient will, that out of man’s fall he might extract materials for
his own glory.
