## <span id="ii.i-p0.1"></span>PREFACE TO THE ELECTRONIC EDITION.

<span id="ii.i-p1"></span>In an attempt to assist you in your efforts,
this electronic publication has been updated to include a new series of
footnotes in addition to the notes from the original Beveridge
Translation. These footnotes were written by Robert J. Dunzweiler,
Professor of Systematic Theology, Biblical Theology Seminary, Hatfield
Pennsylvania. In both systems the footnotes are indicated by superscript
numbers. To distinguish the two systems from each other, Professor
Dunzweiler’s notes are all proceeded by a capital D. We hope you like
this new addition and that it will aid you in your studies.
