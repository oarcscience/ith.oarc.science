### <span id="iv.iii.i-p0.1"></span>ARGUMENT.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p1"></span>The two former Books treated of God the
Creator and Redeemer. This Book, which contains a full exposition of the
Third Part of the Apostles’ Creed, treats of the mode of procuring the
grace of Christ, the benefits which we derive and the effects which
follow from it, or of the operations of the Holy Spirit in regard to our
salvation.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p2"></span>The subject is comprehended under seven
principal heads, which almost all point to the same end, namely, the
doctrine of faith.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p3"></span>I. As it is by the secret and special
operation of the Holy Spirit that we enjoy Christ and all his benefits,
the First Chapter treats of this operation, which is the foundation of
faith, new life, and all holy exercises.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p4"></span>II. Faith being, as it were, the hand by
which we embrace Christ the Redeemer, offered to us by the Holy Spirit,
Faith is fully considered in the Second Chapter.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p5"></span>III. In further explanation of Saving
Faith, and the benefits derived from it, it is mentioned that true
repentance always flows from true faith. The doctrine of Repentance is
considered generally in the Third Chapter, Popish Repentance in the
Fourth Chapter, Indulgences and Purgatory in the Fifth Chapter. Chapters
Sixth to Tenth are devoted to a special consideration of the different
parts of true Repentance—viz. mortification of the flesh, and quickening
of the Spirit.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p6"></span>IV. More clearly to show the utility of
this Faith, and the effects resulting from it, the doctrine of
Justification by Faith is explained in the Eleventh Chapter, and certain
questions connected with it explained from the Twelfth to the Eighteenth
Chapter. Christian liberty a kind of accessory to Justification, is
considered in the Nineteenth Chapter.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p7"></span>V. The Twentieth Chapter is devoted to
Prayer, the principal exercise of faith, and, as it were, the medium or
instrument through which we daily procure blessings from God.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p8"></span>VI. As all do not indiscriminately embrace
the fellowship of Christ offered in the Gospel, but those only whom the
Lord favors with the effectual and special grace of his Spirit, lest any
should impugn this arrangement, Chapters Twenty-First to Twenty-Fourth
are occupied with a necessary and apposite discussion of the subject of
Election.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p9"></span>VII. Lastly, As the hard warfare which the
Christian is obliged constantly to wage may have the effect of
disheartening him, it is shown how it may be alleviated by meditating on
the final resurrection. Hence the subject of the Resurrection is
considered in the Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
