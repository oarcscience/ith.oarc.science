## <span id="v.ii-p0.1"></span>BOOK 2

<span id="v.ii-p1"></span>14. The knowledge of God the Redeemer is
obtained from the fall of man, and from the material cause of
redemption.

<span id="v.ii-p2"></span>15. In the fall of man, we must consider what
he ought to be, and what he may be.

<span id="v.ii-p3"></span>16. For he was created after the image of God;
that is, he was made a partaker of the divine Wisdom, Righteousness, and
Holiness, and, being thus perfect in soul and in body, was bound to
render to God a perfect obedience to his commandments.

<span id="v.ii-p4"></span>17. The immediate causes of the fall
were—Satan, the Serpent, Eve, the forbidden fruit; the remote causes
were—unbelief, ambition, ingratitude, obstinacy. Hence followed the
obliteration of the image of God in man, who became unbelieving,
unrighteous, liable to death.

<span id="v.ii-p5"></span>18. We must now see what he may be, in respect
both of soul and of body. The understanding of the soul in divine
things, that is, in the knowledge and true worship of God, is blinder
than a mole; good works it can neither contrive nor perform. In human
affairs, as in the liberal and mechanical arts, it is exceedingly blind
and variable. Now the will, so far as regards divine things, chooses
only what is evil. So far as regards lower and human affairs, it is
uncertain, wandering, and not wholly at its own disposal.

<span id="v.ii-p6"></span>19. The body follows the depraved appetites of
the soul, is liable to many infirmities, and at length to death.

<span id="v.ii-p7"></span>20. Hence it follows that redemption for
ruined man must be sought through Christ the Mediator; because the first
adoption of a chosen people, the preservation of the Church, her
deliverance from dangers, her recovery after dispersions, and the hope
of the godly, always depended on the grace of the Mediator. Accordingly,
the law was given, that it might keep their minds in suspense till the
coming of Christ; which is evident from the history of a gracious
covenant frequently repeated, from ceremonies, sacrifices, and washings,
from the end of adoption, and from the law of the priesthood.

<span id="v.ii-p8"></span>21. The material cause of redemption is
Christ, in whom we must consider three things; 1. How he is exhibited to
men; 2. How he is received; 3. How men are retained in his fellowship.

<span id="v.ii-p9"></span>22. Christ is exhibited to men by the Law and
by the Gospel.

<span id="v.ii-p10"></span>23. The Law is threefold: Ceremonial,
Judicial, Moral. The use of the Ceremonial Law is repealed, its effect
is perpetual. The Judicial or Political Law was peculiar to the Jews,
and has been set aside, while that universal justice which is described
in the Moral Law remains. The latter, or Moral Law, the object of which
is to cherish and maintain godliness and righteousness, is perpetual,
and is incumbent on all.

<span id="v.ii-p11"></span>24. The use of the Moral Law is threefold.
The first use shows our weakness, unrighteousness, and condemnation; not
that we may despair, but that we may flee to Christ. The second is, that
those who are not moved by promises, may be urged by the terror of
threatenings. The third is, that we may know what is the will of God;
that we may consider it in order to obedience; that our minds may be
strengthened for that purpose; and that we may be kept from falling.

<span id="v.ii-p12"></span>25. The sum of the Law is contained in the
Preface, and in the two Tables. In the Preface we observe, 1. The power
of God, to constrain the people by the necessity of obedience; 2. A
promise of grace, by which he declares himself to be the God of the
Church; 3. A kind act, on the ground of which he charges the Jews with
ingratitude, if they do not requite his goodness.

<span id="v.ii-p13"></span>26. The first Table, which relates to the
worship of God, consists of four commandments.

<span id="v.ii-p14"></span>27. The design of the First Commandment is,
that God alone may be exalted in his people. To God alone, therefore, we
owe adoration, trust, invocation, thanksgiving.

<span id="v.ii-p15"></span>28. The design of the Second Commandment is,
that God will not have his worship profaned by superstitious rites. It
consists of two parts. The former restrains our licentious daring, that
we may not subject God to our senses, or represent him under any visible
shape. The latter forbids us to worship any images on religious grounds,
and, therefore, proclaims his power, which he cannot suffer to be
despised,—his jealousy, for he cannot bear a partner,—his vengeance on
children’s children,—his mercy to those who adore his majesty.

<span id="v.ii-p16"></span>29. The Third Commandment enjoins three
things: 1. That whatever our mind conceives, or our tongue utters, may
have a regard to the majesty of God; 2. That we may not rashly abuse his
holy word and adorable mysteries for the purposes of ambition or
avarice; 3. That we may not throw obloquy on his works, but may speak of
them with commendatians of his Wisdom, Long-suffering, Power, Goodness,
Justice. With these is contrasted a threefold profanation of the name of
God, by perjury, unnecessary oaths, and idolatrous rites; that is, when
we substitute in the place of God saints, or creatures animate or
inanimate.

<span id="v.ii-p17"></span>30. The design of the Fourth Commandment is,
that, being dead to our own affections and works, we may meditate on the
kingdom of God. Now there are three things here to be considered: 1. A
spiritual rest, when believers abstain from their own works, that God
may work in them; 2. That there may be a stated day for calling on the
name of God, for hearing his word, and for performing religious rites;
3. That servants may have some remission from labour.

<span id="v.ii-p18"></span>31. The Second Table, which relates to the
duties of charity towards our neighbour, contains the last Six
Commandments. The design of the Fifth Commandment is, that, since God
takes pleasure in the observance of his own ordinance, the degrees of
dignity appointed by him must be held inviolable. We are therefore
forbidden to take anything from the dignity of those who are above us,
by contempt, obstinacy, or ingratitude; and we are commanded to pay them
reverence, obedience, and gratitude.

<span id="v.ii-p19"></span>32. The design of the Sixth Commandment is,
that, since God has bound mankind by a kind of unity, the safety of all
ought to be considered by each person; whence it follows that we are
forbidden to do violence to private individuals, and are commanded to
exercise benevolence.

<span id="v.ii-p20"></span>33. The design of the Seventh Commandment is,
that, because God loves purity, we ought to put away from us all
uncleanness. He therefore forbids adultery in mind, word, and deed.

<span id="v.ii-p21"></span>34. The design of the Eighth Commandment is,
that, since injustice is an abomination to God, he requires us to render
to every man what is his own. Now men steal, either by violence, or by
malicious imposture, or by craft, or by sycophancy, &c.

<span id="v.ii-p22"></span>35. The design of the Ninth Commandment is,
that, since God, who is truth, abhors falsehood, he forbids calumnies
and false accusations, by which the name of our neighbour is
injured,—and lies, by which any one suffers loss in his fortunes. On the
other hand, he requires every one of us to defend the name and property
of our neighbour by asserting the truth.

<span id="v.ii-p23"></span>36. The design of the Tenth Commandment is,
that, since God would have the whole soul pervaded by love, every desire
averse to charity must be banished from our minds; and therefore every
feeling which tends to the injury of another is forbidden.

<span id="v.ii-p24"></span>37. We have said that Christ is revealed to
us by the Gospel. And, first, the agreement between the Gospel, or the
New Testament, and the Old Testament is demonstrated: 1. Because the
godly, under both dispensations, have had the same hope of immortality;
2. They have had the same covenant, founded not on the works of men, but
on the mercy of God; 3. They have had the same Mediator between God and
men—Christ.

<span id="v.ii-p25"></span>38. Next, five points of difference between
the two dispensations are pointed out. 1. Under the Law the heavenly
inheritance was held out to them under earthly blessings; but under the
Gospel our minds are led directly to meditate upon it. 2. The Old
Testament, by means of figures, presented the image only, while the
reality was absent; but the New Testament exhibits the present truth. 3.
The former, in respect of the Law, was the ministry of condemnation and
death; the latter, of righteousness and life. 4. The former is connected
with bondage, which begets fear in the mind; the latter is connected
with freedom, which produces confidence. 5. The word had been confined
to the single nation of the Jews; but now it is preached to all nations.

<span id="v.ii-p26"></span>39. The sum of evangelical doctrine is, to
teach, 1. What Christ is; 2. Why he was sent; 3. In what manner he
accomplished the work of redemption.

<span id="v.ii-p27"></span>40. Christ is God and man: *God*, that he may
bestow on his people righteousness, sanctification, and redemption;
*Man*, because he had to pay the debt of man.

<span id="v.ii-p28"></span>41. He was sent to perform the office, 1. Of
a Prophet, by preaching the truth, by fulfilling the prophecies, by
teaching and doing the will of his Father; 2. Of a King, by governing
the whole Church and every member of it, and by defending his people
from every kind of adversaries; 3. Of a Priest, by offering his body as
a sacrifice for sins, by reconciling God to us though his obedience, and
by perpetual intercession for his people to the Father.

<span id="v.ii-p29"></span>42. He performed the office of a Redeemer by
dying for our sins, by rising again for our justification, by opening
heaven to us through his ascension, by sitting at the right hand of the
Father whence he will come to judge the quick and the dead; and,
therefore, he procured for us the grace of God and salvation.
