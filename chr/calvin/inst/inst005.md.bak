*Institutes of the Christian Religion*, by John Calvin, tr. Henry
Beveridge \[1845\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

## <span id="ii.iv-p0.1"></span>THE ORIGINAL TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.

### <span id="ii.iv-p0.2"></span>PREFIXED TO THE FOURTH EDITION 1581 AND REPRINTED VERBATIM IN ALL THE SUBSEQUENT EDITIONS.

<span id="ii.iv-p1"></span>T\[HOMAS\] N\[ORTON\], THE TRANSLATOR TO THE
READER.

<span id="ii.iv-p2"></span>Good reader, here is now offered you, the
fourth time printed in English, M. Calvin’s book of the Institution of
Christian Religion; a book of great labour to the author, and of great
profit to the Church of God. M. Calvin first wrote it when he was a
young man, a book of small volume, and since that season he has at
sundry times published it with new increases, still protesting at every
edition himself to be one of those qui scribendo proficiunt, et
proficiendo scribunt, which with their writing do grow in profiting, and
with their profiting do proceed in writing. At length having, in many
\[of\] his other works, traveled about exposition of sundry books of the
Scriptures, and in the same finding occasion to discourse of sundry
common-places and matters of doctrine, which being handled according to
the occasions of the text that were offered him, and not in any other
method, were not so ready for the reader’s use, he therefore entered
into this purpose to enlarge this book of Institutions, and therein to
treat of all those titles and commonplaces largely, with this intent,
that whensoever any occasion fell in his other books to treat of any
such cause, he would not newly amplify his books of commentaries and
expositions therewith, but refer his reader wholly to this storehouse
and treasure of that sort of divine learning. As age and weakness grew
upon him, so he hastened his labour; and, according to his petition to
God, he in manner ended his life with his work, for he lived not long
after.

<span id="ii.iv-p3"></span>So great a jewel was meet to be made most
beneficial, that is to say, applied to most common use. Therefore, in
the very beginning of the Queen’s Majesty’s most blessed reign, I
translated it out of Latin into English for the commodity of the Church
of Christ, at the special request of my dear friends of worthy memory,
Reginald Wolfe and Edward Whitchurch, the one her Majesty’s printer for
the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin tongues, the other her Highness’ printer of
the books of Common Prayer. I performed my work in the house of my said
friend, Edward Whitchurch, a man well known of upright heart and
dealing, an ancient zealous gospeller, as plain and true a friend as
ever I knew living, and as desirous to do anything to common good,
especially by the advancement of true religion.

<span id="ii.iv-p4"></span>At my said first edition of this book, I
considered how the author thereof had of long time purposely laboured to
write the same most exactly, and to pack great plenty of matter in small
room of words; yea, and those so circumspectly and precisely ordered, to
avoid the cavillations of such as for enmity to the truth therein
contained would gladly seek and abuse all advantages which might be
found by any oversight in penning of it, that the sentences were thereby
become so full as nothing might well be added without idle superfluity,
and again so highly pared, that nothing could be diminished without
taking away some necessary substance of matter therein expressed. This
manner of writing, beside the peculiar terms of arts and figures, and
the difficulty of the matters themselves, being throughout interlaced
with the school men’s controversies, made a great hardness in the
author’s own book, in that tongue wherein otherwise he is both plentiful
and easy, insomuch that it sufficeth not to read him once, unless you
can be content to read in vain. This consideration encumbered me with
great doubtfulness for the whole order and frame of my translation. If I
should follow the words, I saw that of necessity the hardness in the
translation must needs be greater than was in the tongue wherein it was
originally written. If I should leave the course of words, and grant
myself liberty after the natural manner of my own tongue, to say that in
English which I conceived to be his meaning in Latin, I plainly
perceived how hardly I might escape error, and on the other side, in
this matter of faith and religion, how perilous it was to err. For I
durst not presume to warrant myself to have his meaning without his
words. And they that wet what it is to translate well and faithfully,
especially in matters of religion, do know that not the only grammatical
construction of words sufficeth, but the very building and order to
observe all advantages of vehemence or grace, by placing or accent of
words, maketh much to the true setting forth of a writer’s mind.

<span id="ii.iv-p5"></span>In the end, I rested upon this determination,
to follow the words so near as the phrase of the English tongue would
suffer me. Which purpose I so performed, that if the English book were
printed in such paper and letter as the Latin is, it should not exceed
the Latin in quantity. Whereby, beside all other commodities that a
faithful translation of so good a work may bring, this one benefit is
moreover provided for such as are desirous to attain some knowledge of
the Latin tongue (which is, at this time, to be wished in many of those
men for whose profession this book most fitly serveth), that they shall
not find any more English than shall suffice to construe the Latin
withal, except in such few places where the great difference of the
phrases of the languages enforced me: so that, comparing the one with
the other, they shall both profit in good matter, and furnish themselves
with understanding of that speech, wherein the greatest treasures of
knowledge are disclosed.

<span id="ii.iv-p6"></span>In the doing hereof, I did not only trust
mine own wit or ability, but examined my whole doing from sentence to
sentence throughout the whole book with conference and overlooking of
such learned men, as my translation being allowed by their Judgment, I
did both satisfy mine own conscience that I had done truly, and their
approving of it might be a good warrant to the reader that nothing
should herein be delivered him but sound, unmingled, and uncorrupted
doctrine, even in such sort as the author himself had first framed it.
All that I wrote, the grave, learned, and virtuous man, M. David
Whitehead (whom I name with honourable remembrance), did, among others,
compare with the Latin, examining every sentence throughout the whole
book. Beside all this, I privately required many, and generally all men
with whom I ever had any talk of this matter, that if they found
anything either not truly translated, or not plainly Englished, they
would inform me thereof, promising either to satisfy them or to amend
it. Since which time, I have not been advertised by any man of anything
which they would require to be altered. Neither had I myself, by reason
of my profession, being otherwise occupied, any leisure to peruse it.
And that is the cause, why not only at the second and third time, but
also at this impression, you have no change at all in the work, but
altogether as it was before.

<span id="ii.iv-p7"></span>Indeed, I perceived many men well-minded and
studious of this book, to require a table for their ease and
furtherance. Their honest desire I have fulfilled in the second edition,
and have added thereto a plentiful table, which is also here inserted,
which I have translated out of the Latin, wherein the principal matters
discoursed in this book are named by their due titles in order of
alphabet, and under every title is set forth a brief sum of the whole
doctrine taught in this book concerning the matter belonging to that
title or common-place; and therewith is added the book, chapter, and
section or division of the chapter, where the same doctrine is more
largely expressed and proved. And for the readier finding thereof, I
have caused the number of the chapters to be set upon every leaf in the
book, and quoted the sections also by their due numbers with the usual
figures of algorism. And now at this last publishing, my friends, by
whose charge it is now newly imprinted in a Roman letter and smaller
volume, with divers other Tables which, since my second edition, were
gathered by M. Marlorate, to be translated and here added for your
benefit.

<span id="ii.iv-p8"></span>Moreover, whereas in the first edition the
evil manner of my scribbling hand, the interlining of my copy, and some
other causes well known among workmen of that faculty, made very many
faults to pass the printer, I have, in the second impression, caused the
book to be composed by the printed copy, and corrected by the written;
whereby it must needs be that it was much more truly done than the other
was, as I myself do know above three hundred faults amended. And now at
this last printing, the composing after a printed copy bringeth some
ease, and the diligence used about the correction having been right
faithfully looked unto, it cannot be but much more truly set forth. This
also is performed, that the volume being smaller, with a letter fair and
legible, it is of more easy price, that it may be of more common use,
and so to more large communicating of so great a treasure to those that
desire Christian knowledge for instruction of their faith, and guiding
of their duties. Thus, on the printer’s behalf and mine, your ease and
commodity (good readers) provided for. Now resteth your own diligence,
for your own profit, in studying it.

<span id="ii.iv-p9"></span>To spend many words in commending the work
itself were needless; yet thus much I think, I may both not unruly and
not vainly say, that though many great learned men have written books of
common-places of our religion, as Melancthon, Sarcerius, and others,
whose works are very good and profitable to the Church of God, yet by
the consenting Judgment of those that understand the same, there is none
to be compared to this work of Calvin, both for his substantial
sufficiency of doctrine, the sound declaration of truth in articles of
our religion, the large and learned confirmation of the same, and the
most deep and strong confutation of all old and new heresies; so that
(the Holy Scriptures excepted) this is one of the most profitable books
for all students of Christian divinity. Wherein (good readers), as I am
glad for the glory of God, and for your benefit, that you may have this
profit of my travel, so I beseech you let me have this use of your
gentleness, that my doings may be construed to such good end as I have
meant them; and that if any thing mislike you by reason of hardness, or
any other cause that may seem to be my default, you will not forthwith
condemn the work, but read it after; in which doing you will find (as
many have confessed to me that they have found by experience) that those
things which at the first reading shall displease you for hardness,
shall be found so easy as so hard matter would suffer, and, for the most
part, more easy than some other phrase which should with greater
looseness and smoother sliding away deceive your understanding. I
confess, indeed, it is not finely and pleasantly written, nor carrieth
with it such delightful grace of speech as some great wise men have
bestowed upon some foolisher things, yet it containeth sound truth set
forth with faithful plainness, without wrong done to the author’s
meaning; and so, if you accept and use it, you shall not fail to have
great profit thereby, and I shall think my labour very well employed.
