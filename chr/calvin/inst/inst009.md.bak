## <span id="ii.viii-p0.1"></span>EPISTLE TO THE READER.

<span id="ii.viii-p1"></span>\[prefixed to the last edition, revised by
the author.\]

<span id="ii.viii-p2"></span>In the First Edition of this work, having
not the least expectation of the success which God, in his boundless
goodness, has been pleased to give it, I had, for the greater part,
performed my task in a perfunctory manner (as is usual in trivial
undertakings); but when I understood that it had been received, by
almost all the pious with a favour which I had never dared to ask, far
less to hope for, the more I was sincerely conscious that the reception
was beyond my deserts, the greater I thought my ingratitude would be,
if, to the very kind wishes which had been expressed towards me, and
which seemed of their own accord to invite me to diligence, I did not
endeavour to respond, at least according to my humble ability. This I
attempted not only in the Second Edition, but in every subsequent one
the work has received some improvement. But though I do not regret the
labour previously expended, I never felt satisfied until the work was
arranged in the order in which it now appears. Now I trust it will
approve itself to the Judgment of all my readers. As a clear proof of
the diligence with which I have laboured to perform this service to the
Church of God, I may be permitted to mention, that last winter, when I
thought I was dying of quartan ague, the more the disorder increased,
the less I spared myself, in order that I might leave this book behind
me, and thus make some return to the pious for their kind urgency. I
could have wished to give it sooner, but it is soon enough if good
enough. I shall think it has appeared in good time when I see it more
productive of benefit than formerly to the Church of God. This is my
only wish.

<span id="ii.viii-p3"></span>And truly it would fare ill with me if, not
contented with the approbation of God alone, I were unable to despise
the foolish and perverse censures of ignorant as well as the malicious
and unjust censures of ungodly men. For although, by the blessing of
God, my most ardent desire has been to advance his kingdoms and promote
the public good,—although I feel perfectly conscious, and take God and
his angels to witness, that ever since I began to discharge the office
of teacher in the Church, my only object has been to do good to the
Church, by maintaining the pure doctrine of godliness, yet I believe
there never was a man more assailed, stung, and torn by calumny \[as
well by the declared enemies of the truth of God, as by many worthless
persons who have crept into his Church—as well by monks who have brought
forth their frocks from their cloisters to spread infection wherever
they come, as by other miscreants not better than they5  <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) \]. After this letter to the reader was
in the press, I had undoubted information that, at Augsburg, where the
Imperial Diet was held, a rumour of my defection to the papacy was
circulated, and entertained in the courts of the princes more readily
than might have been expected.5  <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md)
This, forsooth, is the return made me by those who certainly are not
unaware of numerous proofs of my constancy—proofs which, while they
rebut the foul charge, ought to have defended me against it, with all
humane and impartial judges. But the devil, with all his crew, is
mistaken if he imagines that, by assailing me with vile falsehoods, he
can either cool my zeal, or diminish my exertions. I trust that God, in
his infinite goodness, will enable me to persevere with unruffled
patience in the course of his holy vocation. Of this I give the pious
reader a new proof in the present edition.

<span id="ii.viii-p6"></span>I may further observe, that my object in
this work has been, so to prepare and train candidates for the sacred
office, for the study of the sacred volume, that they may both have an
easy introduction to it, and be able to prosecute it with unfaltering
step; for, if I mistake not, I have given a summary of religion in all
its parts, and digested it in an order which will make it easy for any
one, who rightly comprehends it, to ascertain both what he ought chiefly
to look for in Scripture, and also to what head he ought to refer
whatever is contained in it. Having thus, as it were, paved the way, as
it will be unnecessary, in any Commentaries on Scripture which I may
afterwards publish, to enter into long discussions of doctrinal points,
and enlarge on commonplaces, I will compress them into narrow compass.
In this way much trouble and fatigue will be spared to the pious reader,
provided he comes prepared with a knowledge of the present work as an
indispensable prerequisite. The system here followed being set forth as
in a mirror in all my Commentaries, I think it better to let it speak
for itself than to give any verbal explanation of it.

<span id="ii.viii-p7"></span>Farewell, kind reader: if you derive any
benefit from my labours, aid me with your prayers to our heavenly
Father.

<span id="ii.viii-p8"></span>Geneva, 1*st August* 1559.

<span id="ii.viii-p9"></span>The zeal of those whose cause I undertook,

<span id="ii.viii-p10"></span>Has swelled a short defence into a book.

<span id="ii.viii-p11"></span>“I profess to be one of those who, by
profiting, write, and by writing profit.”—*Augustine*, Epist. 7.

<span id="ii.viii-p4"></span>1 51 The passage in brackets occurs only in
the French original. The words are as follows: “Tant des ennemis
manifestes de la vérité de Dieu, que de beaucoup de canailles qui se
sont fourrez en son Eglise: tant des Moines qui ont apporté leurs frocs
hors de leurs cloistres pour infecter le lieu o˜ ils venoyent, que
d’autres vilains qui ne valent pas mieux qu’eux.”

<span id="fn_47"></span>[48](inst009.htm#fr_47.md) <span

<span id="ii.viii-p5"></span>2 52 The words in the French are, “Avec
trop grande facilité; ce qui monstroit que beaucoup de mechans
hypocrites, faisans profession de l’Evangile, eussent bien voulu
qu’ainsi fust.” With too great facility; showing that many wicked
hypocrites, making profession of the gospel, would have been very glad
it had been so.
