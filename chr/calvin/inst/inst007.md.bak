## <span id="ii.vi-p0.1"></span>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER

<span id="ii.vi-p1"></span>\[prefixed to the second edition, published
at strasburg in 1539.\]

<span id="ii.vi-p2"></span>In the First Edition of this work, having no
expectation of the success which God has, in his goodness, been pleased
to give it, I had, for the greater part, performed my office
perfunctorily, as is usual in trivial undertakings. But when I perceived
that almost all the godly had received it with a favour which I had
never dared to wish, far less to hope for, being sincerely conscious
that I had received much more than I deserved, I thought I should be
very ungrateful if I did not endeavour, at least according to my humble
ability, to respond to the great kindness which had been expressed
towards me, and which spontaneously urged me to diligence. I therefore
ask no other favour from the studious for my new work than that which
they have already bestowed upon me beyond my merits. I feel so much
obliged, that I shall be satisfied if I am thought not to have made a
bad return for the gratitude I owe. This return I would have made much
earlier, had not the Lord, for almost two whole years, exercised me in
an extraordinary manner. But it is soon enough if well enough. I shall
think it has appeared in good season when I perceive that it produces
some fruit to the Church of God. I may add, that my object in this work
was to prepare and train students of theology for the study of the
Sacred Volume, so that they might both have an easy introduction to it,
and be able to proceed in it, with unfaltering step, seeing I have
endeavoured to give such a summary of religion in all its parts, and
have digested it into such an order as may make it not difficult for any
one, who is rightly acquainted with it, to ascertain both what he ought
principally to look for in Scripture, and also to what head he ought to
refer whatever is contained in it. Having thus, as it were, paved the
way, I shall not feel it necessary, in any Commentaries on Scripture
which I may afterwards publish, to enter into long discussions of
doctrines or dilate on common places, and will, therefore, always
compress them. In this way the pious reader will be saved much trouble
and weariness, provided he comes furnished with a knowledge of the
present work as an essential prerequisite. As my Commentary on the
Epistle to the Romans will give a specimen of this plan, I would much
rather let it speak for itself than declare it in words. Farewell, dear
reader, and if you derive any fruit from my labours, give me the benefit
of your prayers to the Lord.
