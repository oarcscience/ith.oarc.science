### <span id="iv.iii.xiii-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 12.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p1"></span>NECESSITY OF CONTEMPLATING THE
JUDGMENT-SEAT OF GOD, IN ORDER TO BE SERIOUSLY CONVINCED OF THE DOCTRINE
OF GRATUITOUS JUSTIFICATION.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p2"></span>The divisions of this chapter are,—I. A
consideration of the righteousness of God overturns the righteousness of
works, as is plain from passages of Scripture, and the confession and
example of the saints, sec. 1-3. II. The same effect produced by a
serious examination of the conscience, and a constant citation to the
divine tribunal, sec. 4 and 5. III. Hence arises, in the hearts of the
godly, not hypocrisy, or a vain opinion of merit, but true humility.
This illustrated by the authority of Scripture and the example of the
Publican, sec. 6, 7. IV. Conclusion—arrogance and security must be
discarded, every man throwing an impediment in the way of the divine
goodness in proportion as he trusts to himself.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p3"></span>*Sections*.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p4"></span>1. Source of error on the subject of
Justification. Sophists speak as if the question were to be discussed
before some human tribunal. It relates to the majesty and justice of
God. Hence nothing accepted without absolute perfection. Passages
confirming this doctrine. If we descend to the righteousness of the Law,
the curse immediately appears.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p5"></span>2. Source of hypocritical confidence.
Illustrated by a simile. Exhortation. Testimony of Job, David, and Paul.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p6"></span>3. Confession of Augustine and Bernard.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p7"></span>4. Another engine overthrowing the
righteousness of works—viz. A serious examination of the conscience, and
a comparison between the perfection of God and the imperfection of man.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p8"></span>5. How it is that we so indulge this
imaginary opinion of our own works. The proper remedy to be found in a
consideration of the majesty of God and our own misery. A description of
this misery.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p9"></span>6. Christian humility consists in
laying aside the imaginary idea of our own righteousness, and trusting
entirely to the mercy of God, apprehended by faith in Christ. This
humility described. Proved by passages of Scripture.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p10"></span>7. The parable of the Publican
explained.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p11"></span>8. Arrogance, security, and
self-confidence, must be renounced. General rule, or summary of the
above doctrine.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p12"></span>1. Although the perfect truth of the
above doctrine is proved by clear passages of Scripture, yet we cannot
clearly see how necessary it is, before we bring distinctly into view
the foundations on which the whole discussion ought to rest. First,
then, let us remember that the righteousness which we are considering is
not that of a human, but of a heavenly tribunal; and so beware of
employing our own little standard to measure the perfection which is to
satisfy the justice of God. It is strange with what rashness and
presumption this is commonly defined. Nay, we see that none talk more
confidently, or, so to speak, more blusteringly, of the righteousness of
works than those whose diseases are most palpable, and blemishes most
apparent. This they do because they reflect not on the righteousness of
Christ, which, if they had the slightest perception of it, they would
never treat with so much insult. It is certainly undervalued, if not
recognized to be so perfect that nothing can be accepted that is not in
every respect entire and absolute, and tainted by no impurity; such
indeed as never has been, and never will be, found in man. It is easy
for any man, within the precincts of the schools, to talk of the
sufficiency of works for justification; but when we come into the
presence of God there must be a truce to such talk. The matter is there
discussed in earnest, and is no longer a theatrical logomachy. Hither
must we turn our minds if we would inquire to any purpose concerning
true righteousness; the question must be: How shall we answer the
heavenly Judge when he calls us to account? Let us contemplate that
Judge, not as our own unaided intellect conceives of him, but as he is
portrayed to us in Scripture (see especially the Book of Job), with a
brightness which obscures the stars, a strength which melts the
mountains, an anger which shakes the earth, a wisdom which takes the
wise in their own craftiness, a purity before which all things become
impure, a righteousness to which not even angels are equal (so far is it
from making the guilty innocent), a vengeance which once kindled burns
to the lowest hell (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.1"></span>[Exod.
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.1"></span>; <span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.2"></span>[Nahum
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.2"></span>; <span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.3"></span>[Deut.
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.3"></span>). Let Him, I say, sit in judgment on the
actions of men, and who will feel secure in sisting himself before his
throne? “Who among us,” says the prophets “shall dwell with the
devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He
that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly,” &c. (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.4"></span>[Isa.
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.4"></span>). Let whoso will come forth. Nay, the
answer shows that no man can. For, on the other hand, we hear the
dreadful voice: “If thou, Lord, shouldst mark our iniquities, O Lord,
who shall stand?” (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.5"></span>[Ps.
130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.5"></span>). All must immediately perish, as Job
declares, “Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more
pure than his Maker? Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his
angels he charged with folly: How much less in them that dwell in houses
of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the
moth? They are destroyed from morning to evening,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.6"></span>[Job
4:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.6"></span>). Again, “Behold, he putteth no trust in
his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. How much more
abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?”
(<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.7"></span>[Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.7"></span>). I confess, indeed, that in the Book of
Job reference is made to a righteousness of a more exalted description
than the observance of the Law. It is of importance to attend to this
distinction; for even could a man satisfy the Law, he could not stand
the scrutiny of that righteousness which transcends all our thoughts.
Hence, although Job was not conscious of offending, he is still dumb
with astonishment, because he sees that God could not be appeased even
by the sanctity of angels, were their works weighed in that supreme
balance. But to advert no farther to this righteousness, which is
incomprehensible, I only say, that if our life is brought to the
standard of the written law, we are lethargic indeed if we are not
filled with dread at the many maledictions which God has employed for
the purpose of arousing us, and among others, the following general one:
“Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.8"></span>[Deut.
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p12.8"></span>). In short, the whole discussion of this
subject will be insipid and frivolous, unless we sist ourselves before
the heavenly Judge, and anxious for our acquittal, voluntarily humble
ourselves, confessing our nothingness.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p13"></span>2. Thus then must we raise our eyes
that we may learn to tremble instead of vainly exulting. It is easy,
indeed, when the comparison is made among men, for every one to plume
himself on some quality which others ought not to despise; but when we
rise to God, that confidence instantly falls and dies away. The case of
the soul with regard to God is very analogous to that of the body in
regard to the visible firmament. The bodily eye, while employed in
surveying adjacent objects, is pleased with its own perspicacity; but
when directed to the sun, being dazzled and overwhelmed by the
refulgence, it becomes no less convinced of its weakness than it
formerly was of its power in viewing inferior objects. Therefore, lest
we deceive ourselves by vain confidence, let us recollect that even
though we deem ourselves equal or superior to other men, this is nothing
to God, by whose judgment the decision must be given. But if our
presumption cannot be tamed by these considerations, he will answer us
as he did the Pharisees, “Ye are they which justify yourselves before
men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed
among men is abomination in the sight of God,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.1"></span>[Luke
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.1"></span>). Go now and make a proud boast of your
righteousness among men, while God in heaven abhors it. But what are the
feelings of the servants of God, of those who are truly taught by his
Spirit? “Enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.2"></span>[Ps.
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.2"></span>). Another, though in a sense somewhat
different, says, “How should man be just with God? If he will contend
with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.3"></span>[Job
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.3"></span>). Here we are plainly told what the
righteousness of God is, namely, a righteousness which no human works
can satisfy which charges us with a thousand sins, while not one sin can
be excused. Of this righteousness Paul, that chosen vessel of God, had
formed a just idea, when he declared, “I know nothing by myself, yet am
I not hereby justified,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.4"></span>[1 Cor.
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.4"></span>).

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p14"></span>3. Such examples exist not in the
sacred volume only; all pious writers show that their sentiment was the
same. Thus Augustine says, “Of all pious men groaning under this burden
of corruptible flesh, and the infirmities of this life, the only hope
is, that we have one Mediator Jesus Christ the righteous, and that he
intercedes for our sins,” (August. ad Bonif. lib. 3, c. 5). What do we
hear? If this is their only hope, where is their confidence in works?
When he says *only*, he leaves no other. Bernard says, “And, indeed,
where have the infirm firm security and safe rest, but in the wounds of
the Savior? Hold it then the more securely, the more powerful he is to
save. The world frowns, the body presses, the devil lays snares: I fall
not, because I am founded on a firm rock. I have sinned a grievous sin:
conscience is troubled, but it shall not be overwhelmed, for I will
remember the wounds of the Lord.” He afterwards concludes, “My merit,
therefore, is the compassion of the Lord; plainly I am not devoid of
merit so long as he is not devoid of commiseration. But if the mercies
of the Lord are many, equally many are my merits. Shall I sing of my own
righteousness? O Lord, I will make mention of thy righteousness alone.
That righteousness is mine also, being made mine by God,” (Bernard,
Serm. 61, in Cantic). Again, in another passage, “Man’s whole merit is
to place his whole hope in him who makes the whole man safe,” (in Psal.
Qui Habitat. Serm. 15). In like manner, reserving peace to himself, he
leaves the glory to God: “Let thy glory remain unimpaired: it is well
with me if I have peace; I altogether abjure boasting, lest if I should
usurp what is not mine, I lose also what is offered,” (Serm. 13, in
Cantic). He says still more plainly in another place: “Why is the Church
solicitous about merits? God purposely supplies her with a firmer and
more secure ground of boasting. There is no reason for asking by what
merits may we hope for blessings, especially when you hear in the
prophet, ‘Thus saith the Lord God, I do not this for your sakes, O house
of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake,’ (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p14.1"></span>[Ezek.
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022.md),
[32](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p14.1"></span>). It is sufficient for merit to know that
merits suffice not; but as it is sufficient for merit not to presume on
merit, so to be without merits is sufficient for condemnation,”
(Bernard, Serm. 68). The free use of the term merits for good works must
be pardoned to custom. Bernard’s purpose was to alarm hypocrites, who
turned the grace of God into licentiousness, as he shortly after
explains: “Happy the church which neither wants merit without
presumption, nor presumption without merit. It has ground to presume,
but not merit. It has merit, merit to deserve, not presume. Is not the
absence of presumption itself a merit? He, therefore, to whom the many
mercies of the Lord furnish ample grounds of boasting, presumes the more
securely that he presumes not,” (Bernard, Serm. 68).

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p15"></span>4. Thus, indeed, it is. Aroused
consciences, when they have to do with God, feel this to be the only
asylum in which they can breathe safely. For if the stars which shine
most brightly by night lose their brightness on the appearance of the
sun, what think we will be the case with the highest purity of man when
contrasted with the purity of God? For the scrutiny will be most strict,
penetrating to the most hidden thoughts of the heart. As Paul says, it
“will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make
manifest the counsels of the heart,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p15.1"></span>[1 Cor.
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p15.1"></span>); will compel the reluctant and
dissembling conscience to bring forward every thing, even things which
have now escaped our memory. The devil, aware of all the iniquities
which he has induced us to perpetrate, will appear as accuser; the
external show of good works, the only thing now considered, will then be
of no avail; the only thing demanded will be the true intent of the
will. Hence hypocrisy, not only that by which a man, though consciously
guilty before God, affects to make an ostentatious display before man,
but that by which each imposes upon himself before God (so prone are we
to soothe and flatter ourselves), will fall confounded, how much soever
it may now swell with pride and presumption. Those who do not turn their
thoughts to this scene may be able for the moment calmly and
complacently to rear up a righteousness for themselves; but this the
judgment of God will immediately overthrow, just as great wealth amassed
in a dream vanishes the moment we awake. Those who, as in the presence
of God, inquire seriously into the true standard of righteousness, will
certainly find that all the works of men, if estimated by their own
worth, are nothing but vileness and pollution, that what is commonly
deemed justice is with God mere iniquity; what is deemed integrity is
pollution; what deemed glory is ignominy.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p16"></span>5. Let us not decline to descend from
this contemplation of the divine perfection, to look into ourselves
without flattery or blind self-love. It is not strange that we are so
deluded in this matter, seeing none of us can avoid that pestilential
self-indulgence, which, as Scripture proclaims, is naturally inherent in
all: “Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,” says Solomon (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.1"></span>[Prov.
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.1"></span>). And again, “All the ways of a man are
clean in his own eyes,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.2"></span>[Prov.
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.2"></span>). What then? does this hallucination
excuse him? No, indeed, as Solomon immediately adds, “The Lord weigheth
the spirits;” that is, while man flatters himself by wearing an external
mask of righteousness, the Lord weighs the hidden impurity of the heart
in his balance. Seeing, therefore, that nothing is gained by such
flattery, let us not voluntarily delude ourselves to our own
destruction. To examine ourselves properly, our conscience must be
called to the judgment-seat of God. His light is necessary to disclose
the secret recesses of wickedness which otherwise lie too deeply hid.
Then only shall we clearly perceive what the value of our works is; that
man, so far from being just before God, is but rottenness and a worm,
abominable and vain, drinking in “iniquity like water.” For “who can
bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.3"></span>[Job
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.3"></span>). Then we shall experience the truth of
what Job said of himself: “If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall
condemn me: if I say I am perfect, it shall prove me perverse,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.4"></span>[Job
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.4"></span>). Nor does the complaint which the
prophet made concerning Israel apply to one age only. It is true of
every age, that “all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned
every one to his own way,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.5"></span>[Isaiah
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.5"></span>). Indeed, he there comprehends all to
whom the gift of redemption was to come. And the strictness of the
examination ought to be continued until it have completely alarmed us,
and in that way prepared us for receiving the grace of Christ. For he is
deceived who thinks himself capable of enjoying it, until he have laid
aside all loftiness of mind. There is a well-known declaration, “God
resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.6"></span>[1 Pet.
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p16.6"></span>).

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p17"></span>6. But what means is there of humbling
us if we do not make way for the mercy of God by our utter indigence and
destitution? For I call it not humility, so long as we think there is
any good remaining in us. Those who have joined together the two things,
to think humbly of ourselves before God and yet hold our own
righteousness in some estimation, have hitherto taught a pernicious
hypocrisy. For if we confess to God contrary to what we feel, we
wickedly lie to him; but we cannot feel as we ought without seeing that
every thing like a ground of boasting is completely crushed. Therefore,
when you hear from the prophets “thou wilt save the afflicted people;
but wilt bring down high looks” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p17.1"></span>[Ps.
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p17.1"></span>), consider, first, that there is no
access to salvation unless all pride is laid aside and true humility
embraced; secondly, that that humility is not a kind of moderation by
which you yield to God some article of your right (thus men are called
humble in regard to each other when they neither conduct themselves
haughtily nor insult over other, though they may still entertain some
consciousness of their own excellence), but that it is the unfeigned
submission of a mind overwhelmed by a serious conviction of its want and
misery. Such is the description every where given by the word of God.
When in Zephaniah the Lord speaks thus, “I will take away out of the
midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be
haughty because of my holy mountain. I will also leave in the midst of
thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of
the Lord,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p17.2"></span>[Zeph.
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p17.2"></span>), does he not plainly show who are the
humble—viz. those who lie afflicted by a knowledge of their poverty? On
the contrary, he describes the proud as rejoicing (*exultantes*), such
being the mode in which men usually express their delight in prosperity.
To the humble, whom he designs to save, he leaves nothing but hope in
the Lord. Thus, also, in Isaiah, “To this man will I look, even to him
that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p17.3"></span>[Isaiah
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p17.3"></span>). again, “Thus saith the high and lofty
One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high
and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,
to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the
contrite ones,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p17.4"></span>[Isaiah
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p17.4"></span>). By the term *contrition* which you so
often hear, understand a wounded heart, which, humbling the individual
to the earth, allows him not to rise. With such contrition must your
heart be wounded, if you would, according to the declaration of God, be
exalted with the humble. If this is not your case, you shall be humbled
by the mighty hand of God to your shame and disgrace.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p18"></span>7. Our divine Master, not confining
himself to words, has by a parable set before us, as in a picture, a
representation of true humility. He brings forward a publican, who
standing afar off, and not daring to lift up his eyes to heaven, smites
upon his breast, laments aloud, and exclaims, “ God be merciful to me a
sinner,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p18.1"></span>[Luke
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p18.1"></span>). Let us not suppose that he gives the
signs of a fictitious modesty when he dares not come near or lift up his
eyes to heaven, but, smiting upon his breast, confesses himself a
sinner; let us know that these are the evidences of his internal
feeling. With him our Lord contrasts the Pharisee, who thanks God “I am
not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I
possess.” In this public confession he admits that the righteousness
which he possesses is the gift of God; but because of his confidence
that he is righteous, he departs from the presence of God unaccepted and
abominated. The publican acknowledging his iniquity is justified. Hence
we may see how highly our humility is valued by the Lord: our breast
cannot receive his mercy until deprived completely of all opinion of its
own worth. When such an opinion is entertained, the door of mercy is
shut. That there might be no doubt on this matter, the mission on which
Christ was sent into the world by his Father was “to preach good tidings
to the meek,” “to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the
captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to
proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of
our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in
Zion to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,
the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p18.2"></span>[Isa.
61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p18.2"></span>). In fulfillment of that mission, the
only persons whom he invites to share in his beneficence are the “weary
and heavy laden.” In another passage he says, “ I am not come to call
the righteous, but sinners to repentance,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p18.3"></span>[Mt.
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p18.3"></span>; 9:13).

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p19"></span>8. Therefore if we would make way for
the call of Christ, we must put far from us all arrogance and
confidence. The former is produced by a foolish persuasion of
self-righteousness, when a man thinks that he has something in himself
which deservedly recommends him to God; the latter may exist without any
confidence in works.42  <span id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) For many
sinners, intoxicated with the pleasures of vice, think not of the
judgment of God. Lying stupefied, as it were, by a kind of lethargy,
they aspire not to the offered mercy. It is not less necessary to shake
off torpor of this description than every kind of confidence in
ourselves, in order that we may haste to Christ unencumbered, and while
hungry and empty be filled with his blessings. Never shall we have
sufficient confidence in him unless utterly distrustful of ourselves;
never shall we take courage in him until we first despond of ourselves;
never shall we have full consolation in him until we cease to have any
in ourselves. When we have entirely discarded all self-confidence, and
trust solely in the certainty of his goodness, we are fit to apprehend
and obtain the grace of God. “When,” (as Augustine says), “forgetting
our own merits, we embrace the gifts of Christ, because if he should
seek for merits in us we should not obtain his gifts,” (August. de Verb.
Apost. 8). With this Bernard admirably accords, comparing the proud who
presume in the least on their merits, to unfaithful servants, who
wickedly take the merit of a favor merely passing through them, just as
if a wall were to boast of producing the ray which it receives through
the window (Bernard, Serm. 13, in Cant). Not to dwell longer here, let
us lay down this short but sure and general rule, That he is prepared to
reap the fruits of the divine mercy who has thoroughly emptied himself,
I say not of righteousness (he has none), but of a vain and blustering
show of righteousness; for to whatever extent any man rests in himself,
to the same extent he impedes the beneficence of God.
