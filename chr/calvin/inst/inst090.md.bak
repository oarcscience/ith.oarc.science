### <span id="iv.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 10.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p1"></span>OF THE POWER OF MAKING LAWS. THE CRUELTY
OF THE POPE AND HIS ADHERENTS, IN THIS RESPECT, IN TYRANNICALLY
OPPRESSING AND DESTROYING SOULS.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p2"></span>This chapter treats,—I. Of human
constitutions in general. Of the distinction between Civil and
Ecclesiastical Laws. Of conscience, why and in what sense ministers
cannot impose laws on the conscience, sec. 1-8. II. Of traditions or
Popish constitutions relating to ceremonies and discipline. The many
vices inherent in them, sec. 9-17. Arguments in favour of those
traditions refuted, sec. 17-26. III. Of Ecclesiastical constitutions
that are good and lawful, sec. 27-32.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p3"></span>*Sections*.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p4"></span>1. The power of the Church in enacting
laws. This made a source of human traditions. Impiety of these
traditions.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p5"></span>2. Many of the Papistical traditions not
only difficult, but impossible to be observed.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p6"></span>3. That the question may be more
conveniently explained, nature of conscience must be defined.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p7"></span>4. Definition of conscience explained.
Examples in illustration of the definition.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p8"></span>5. Paul’s doctrine of submission to
magistrates for conscience sake, gives no countenance to the Popish

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p9"></span>6. The question stated. A brief mode of
deciding it.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p10"></span>7. A perfect rule of life in the Law. God

contradictory to the Word of God.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p12"></span>9. Ceremonial traditions of the Papists.
Their impiety. Substituted for the true worship of God.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p13"></span>10. Through these ceremonies the
commandment of God made void.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p14"></span>11. Some of these ceremonies useless and
childish. Their endless variety. Introduce Judaism.

admitted for a time for the sake of weak brethren.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p26"></span>23. Observance of the Popish traditions
inconsistent with Christian liberty, torturing to the conscience, and
insulting to God.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p27"></span>24. All human inventions in religion
displeasing to God. Reason. Confirmed by an example.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p28"></span>25. An argument founded on the examples

burdens to be borne. Answer.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p30"></span>27. Third part of the chapter, treating
of lawful Ecclesiastical arrangements. Their foundation in the general
axiom, that all things be done decently and in order. Two extremes to be
avoided.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p31"></span>28. All Ecclesiastical arrangements to be
thus tested. What Paul means by things done decently and in order.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p32"></span>29. Nothing decent in the Popish
ceremonies. Description of true decency. Examples of Christian decency
and order.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p33"></span>30. No arrangement decent and orderly,
unless founded on the authority of God, and derived from Scripture.
Charity the best guide in these matters.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p34"></span>31. Constitutions thus framed not to be
neglected or despised.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p35"></span>32. Cautions to be observed in regard to
such constitutions.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p36"></span>1. We come now to the second part of
power, which, according to them, consists in the enacting of laws, from
which source innumerable traditions have arisen, to be as many deadly
snares to miserable souls. For they have not been more scrupulous than
the Scribes and Pharisees in laying burdens on the shoulders of others,
which they would not touch with their finger (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p36.1"></span>[Mt
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p36.1"></span>;
<span id="iv.iv.xi-p36.2"></span>[Luke
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p36.2"></span>). I have elsewhere shown (Book 3 chap. 4
sec. 4-7) how cruel murder they commit by their doctrine of auricular
confession. The same violence is not apparent in other laws, but those
which seem most tolerable press tyrannically on the conscience. I say
nothing as to the mode in which they adulterate the worship of God, and
rob God himself, who is the only Lawgiver, of his right. The power we
have now to consider is, whether it be lawful for the Church to bind
laws upon the conscience? In this discussion, civil order is not
touched; but the only point considered is, how God may be duly
worshipped according to the rule which he has prescribed, and how our
spiritual liberty, with reference to God, may remain unimpaired. In
ordinary language, the name of human traditions is given to all decrees
concerning the worship of God, which men have issued without the
authority of his word. We contend against these, not against the sacred
and useful constitutions of the Church, which tend to preserve
discipline, or decency, or peace. Our aim is to curb the unlimited and
barbarous empire usurped over souls by those who would be thought
pastors of the Church, but who are in fact its most cruel murderers.
They say that the laws which they enact are spiritual, pertaining to the
soul, and they affirm that they are necessary to eternal life. But thus
the kingdom of Christ, as I lately observed, is invaded; thus the
liberty, which he has given to the consciences of believers, is
completely oppressed and overthrown. I say nothing as to the great
impiety with which, to sanction the observance of their laws, they
declare that from it they seek forgiveness of sins, righteousness and
salvation, while they make the whole sum of religion and piety to
consist in it. What I contend for is, that necessity ought not to be
laid on consciences in matters in which Christ has made them free; and
unless freed, cannot, as we have previously shown (Book 3 chap. 19),
have peace with God. They must acknowledge Christ their deliverer, as
their only king, and be ruled by the only law of liberty—namely, the
sacred word of the Gospel—if they would retain the grace which they have
once received in Christ: they must be subject to no bondage, be bound by
no chains.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p37"></span>2. These Solons, indeed, imagine that
their constitutions are laws of liberty, a pleasant yoke, a light
burden: but who sees not that this is mere falsehood. They themselves,
indeed, feel not the burden of their laws. Having cast off the fear of
God, they securely and assiduously disregard their own laws as well as
those which are divine. Those, however, who feel any interest in their
salvation, are far from thinking themselves free so long as they are
entangled in these snares. We see how great caution Paul employed in
this matter, not venturing to impose a fetter in any one thing, and with
good reason: he certainly foresaw how great a wound would be inflicted
on the conscience if these things should be made necessary which the
Lord had left free. On the contrary, it is scarcely possible to count
the constitutions which these men have most grievously enforced, under
the penalty of eternal death, and which they exact with the greatest
rigour, as necessary to salvation. And while very many of them are most
difficult of observance, the whole taken together are impossible; so
great is the mass. How, then, possibly can those, on whom this mountain
of difficulty lies, avoid being perplexed with extreme anxiety, and
filled with terror? My intention here then is, to impugn constitutions
of this description; constitutions enacted for the purpose of binding
the conscience inwardly before God, and imposing religious duties, as if
they enjoined things necessary to salvation.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p38"></span>3. Many are greatly puzzled with this
question, from not distinguishing, with sufficient care, between what is
called the external forum and the forum of conscience56  <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577) (Book 3 chap. 19 sec 15.md). Moreover,
the difficulty is increased by the terms in which Paul enjoins obedience
to magistrates, “not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake”
(<span id="iv.iv.xi-p39.1"></span>[Rom.
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p39.1"></span>); and from which it would follow, that civil
laws also bind the conscience. But if this were so, nothing that we have
said of spiritual government, in the last chapter, and are to say in
this, would stand. To solve this difficulty, we must first understand
what is meant by conscience. The definition must be derived from the
etymology of the term. As when men, with the mind and intellect,
apprehend the knowledge of things, they are thereby said to know, and
hence the name of science or knowledge is used; so, when they have, in
addition to this, a sense of the divine judgment, as a witness not
permitting them to hide their sins, but bringing them as criminals
before the tribunal of the judge, that sense is called conscience. For
it occupies a kind of middle place between God and man, not suffering
man to suppress what he knows in himself, but following him out until it
bring him to conviction. This is what Paul means, when he says that
conscience bears witness, “our thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else
excusing each other” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p39.2"></span>[Rom.
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p39.2"></span>). Simple knowledge, therefore, might exist
in a man, as it were, shut up, and therefore the sense which sists men
before the judgment-seat of God has been placed over him as a sentinel,
to observe and spy out all his secrets, that nothing may remain buried
in darkness. Hence the old proverb, Conscience is a thousand witnesses.
For this reason, Peter also uses the “answer of a good conscience
towards God” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p39.3"></span>[1 Pet.
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p39.3"></span>); for tranquillity of mind, when, persuaded
of the grace of Christ, we with boldness present ourselves before God.
And the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says, that we have “no more
conscience of sins,” that we are freed or acquitted, so that sin no
longer accuses us (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p39.4"></span>[Heb.
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p39.4"></span>).

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p40"></span>4. Wherefore, as works have respect to
men, so conscience bears reference to God; and hence a good conscience
is nothing but inward integrity of heart. In this sense, Paul says, that
“the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a
good conscience, and of faith unfeigned” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p40.1"></span>[1 Tim.
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p40.1"></span>.md).
He afterwards, in the same chapter, shows how widely it differs from
intellect, saying, the, “some having put away” a good conscience,
“concerning faith have made shipwreck.” For by these words he intimates,
that it is a living inclination to worship God, a sincere desire to live
piously and holily. Sometimes, indeed, it is extended to men also, as
when Paul declares, “Herein do I exercise myself, to have always a
conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p40.2"></span>[Acts
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p40.2"></span>). But this is said, because the benefits of
a good conscience flow forth and reach even to men. Properly speaking,
however, it respects God alone, as I have already said. Hence a law may
be said to bind the conscience when it simply binds a man without
referring to men, or taking them into account. For example, God enjoins
us not only to keep our mind chaste and pure from all lust, but
prohibits every kind of obscenity in word, and all external
lasciviousness. This law my conscience is bound to observe, though there
were not another man in the world. Thus he who behaves intemperately not
only sins by setting a bad example to his brethren, but stands convicted
in his conscience before God. Another rule holds in the case of things
which are in themselves indifferent. For we ought to abstain when they
give offence, but conscience is free. Thus Paul says of meat consecrated
to idols, “If any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake;”
“conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p40.3"></span>[1 Cor.
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#029)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p40.3"></span>.md).
A believer would sin, if, after being warned, he should still eat such
kind of meat. But however necessary abstinence may be in respect of a
brother, as prescribed by the Lord, conscience ceases not to retain its
liberty. We see how the law, while binding the external work, leaves the
conscience free.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p41"></span>5. Let us now return to human laws. If
they are imposed for the purpose of forming a religious obligation, as
if the observance of them was in itself necessary, we say that the
restraint thus laid on the conscience is unlawful. Our consciences have
not to do with men but with God only. Hence the common distinction
between the earthly forum and the forum of conscience.56  <span
id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578.md) When the whole world was enveloped in
the thickest darkness of ignorance, it was still held (like a small ray
of light which remained unextinguished) that conscience was superior to
all human judgments. Although this, which was acknowledged in word, was
afterwards violated in fact, yet God was pleased that there should even
then exist an attestation to liberty, exempting the conscience from the
tyranny of man. But we have not yet explained the difficulty which
arises from the words of Paul. For if we must obey princes not only from
fear of punishment but for conscience sake, it seems to follow, that the
laws of princes have dominion over the conscience. If this is true, the
same thing must be affirmed of ecclesiastical laws. I answer, that the
first thing to be done here is to distinguish between the genus and the
species. For though individual laws do not reach the conscience, yet we
are bound by the general command of God, which enjoins us to submit to
magistrates. And this is the point on which Paul’s discussion turns—viz.
that magistrates are to be honoured, because they are ordained of God
(<span id="iv.iv.xi-p42.1"></span>[Rom.
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p42.1"></span>). Meanwhile, he does not at all teach that
the laws enacted by them reach to the internal government of the soul,
since he everywhere proclaims that the worship of God, and the spiritual
rule of living righteously, are superior to all the decrees of men.
Another thing also worthy of observation, and depending on what has been
already said, is, that human laws, whether enacted by magistrates or by
the Church, are necessary to be observed (I speak of such as are just
and good), but do not therefore in themselves bind the conscience,
because the whole necessity of observing them respects the general end,
and consists not in the things commanded. Very different, however, is
the case of those which prescribe a new form of worshipping God, and
introduce necessity into things that are free.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p43"></span>6. Such, however, are what in the present
day are called ecclesiastical constitutions by the Papacy, and are
brought forward as part of the true and necessary worship of God. But as
they are without number, so they form innumerable fetters to bind and
ensnare the soul. Though, in expounding the law, we have adverted to
this subject (Book 3 chap. 4 sec. 6), yet as this is more properly the
place for a full discussion of it, I will now study to give a summary of
it as carefully as I can. I shall, however, omit the branch relating to
the tyranny with which false bishops arrogate to themselves the right of
teaching whatever they please, having already considered it as far as
seemed necessary, but shall treat at length of the power which they
claim of enacting laws. The pretext, then, on which our false bishops
burden the conscience with new laws is, that the Lord has constituted
them spiritual legislators, and given them the government of the Church.
Hence they maintain that everything which they order and prescribe must,
of necessity, be observed by the Christian people, that he who violates
their commands is guilty of a twofold disobedience, being a rebel both
against God and the Church. Assuredly, if they were true bishops, I
would give them some authority in this matter, not so much as they
demand, but so much as is requisite for duly arranging the polity of the
Church; but since they are anything but what they would be thought, they
cannot possibly assume anything to themselves, however little, without
being in excess. But as this also has been elsewhere shown, let us grant
for the present, that whatever power true bishops possess justly belongs
to them, still I deny that they have been set over believers as
legislators to prescribe a rule of life at their own hands, or bind the
people committed to them to their decrees. When I say this, I mean that
they are not at all entitled to insist that whatever they devise without
authority from the word of God shall be observed by the Church as matter
of necessity. Since such power was unknown to the apostles, and was so
often denied to the ministers of the Church by our Lord himself, I
wonder how any have dared to usurp, and dare in the present day to
defend it, without any precedent from the apostles, and against the
manifest prohibition of God.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p44"></span>7. Everything relating to a perfect rule
of life the Lord has so comprehended in his law, that he has left
nothing for men to add to the summary there given. His object in doing
this was, first, that since all rectitude of conduct consists in
regulating all our actions by his will as a standard, he alone should be
regarded as the master and guide of our life; and, secondly, that he
might show that there is nothing which he more requires of us than
obedience. For this reason James says, “He that speaketh evil of his
brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth
the law:” “There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy”
(<span id="iv.iv.xi-p44.1"></span>[Jas.
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p44.1"></span>.md).
We hear how God claims it as his own peculiar privilege to rule us by
his laws. This had been said before by Isaiah, though somewhat
obscurely, “The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is
our king; he will save us” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p44.2"></span>[Isa.
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p44.2"></span>). Both passages show that the power of life
and death belongs to him who has power over the soul. Nay, James clearly
expresses this. This power no man may assume to himself. God, therefore,
to whom the power of saving and destroying belongs, must be acknowledged
as the only King of souls, or, as the words of Isaiah express it, he is
our king and judge, and lawgiver and saviour. So Peter, when he reminds
pastors of their duty, exhorts them to feed the flock without lording it
over the heritage (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p44.3"></span>[1 Pet.
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p44.3"></span>.md);
meaning by heritage the body of believers. If we duly consider that it
is unlawful to transfer to man what God declares to belong only to
himself, we shall see that this completely cuts off all the power
claimed by those who would take it upon them to order anything in the
Church without authority from the word of God.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p45"></span>8. Moreover, since the whole question
depends on this, that God being the only lawgiver, it is unlawful for
men to assume that honour to themselves, it will be proper to keep in
mind the two reasons for which God claims this solely for himself. The
one reason is, that his will is to us the perfect rule of all
righteousness and holiness, and that thus in the knowledge of it we have
a perfect rule of life. The other reason is, that when the right and
proper method of worshipping him is in question, he whom we ought to
obey, and on whose will we ought to depend, alone has authority over our
souls. When these two reasons are attended to, it will be easy to decide
what human constitutions are contrary to the word of the Lord. Of this
description are all those which are devised as part of the true worship
of God, and the observance of which is bound upon the conscience, as of
necessary obligation. Let us remember then to weigh all human laws in
this balance, if we would have a sure test which will not allow us to go
astray. The former reason is urged by Paul in the Epistle to the
Colossians against the false apostles who attempted to lay new burdens
on the churches. The second reason he more frequently employs in the
Epistle to the Galatians in a similar case. In the Epistle to the
Colossians, then, he maintains that the doctrine of the true worship of
God is not to be sought from men, because the Lord has faithfully and
fully taught us in what way he is to be worshipped. To demonstrate this,
he says in the first chapter, that in the gospel is contained all
wisdom, that the man of God may be made perfect in Christ. In the
beginning of the second chapter, he says that all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ, and from this he concludes
that believers should beware of being led away from the flock of Christ
by vain philosophy, according to the constitutions of men (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p45.1"></span>[Col.
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p45.1"></span>). In the end of the chapter, he still more
decisively condemns all ἐθελοθρησκειας that is, fictitious modes of
worship which men themselves devise or receive from others, and all
precepts whatsoever which they presume to deliver at their own hand
concerning the worship of God. We hold, therefore, that all
constitutions are impious in the observance of which the worship of God
is pretended to be placed. The passages in the Galatians in which he
insists that fetters are not to be bound on the conscience (which ought
to be ruled by God alone), are sufficiently plain, especially chapter 5.
Let it, therefore, suffice to refer to them.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p46"></span>9. But that the whole matter may be made
plainer by examples, it will be proper, before we proceed, to apply the
doctrine to our own times. The constitutions which they call
ecclesiastical, and by which the Pope, with his adherents, burdens the
Church, we hold to be pernicious and impious, while our opponents defend
them as sacred and salutary. Now there are two kinds of them, some
relating to ceremonies and rites, and others more especially to
discipline. Have we, then, any just cause for impugning both? Assuredly
a juster cause than we could wish. First, do not their authors
themselves distinctly declare that the very essence of the worship of
God (so to speak) is contained in them? For what end do they bring
forward their ceremonies but just that God may be worshipped by them?
Nor is this done merely by error in the ignorant multitude, but with the
approbation of those who hold the place of teachers. I am not now
adverting to the gross abominations by which they have plotted the
adulteration of all godliness, but they would not deem it to be so
atrocious a crime to err in any minute tradition, did they not make the
worship of God subordinate to their fictions. Since Paul then declares
it to be intolerable that the legitimate worship of God should be
subjected to the will of men, wherein do we err when we are unable to
tolerate this in the present day? especially when we are enjoined to
worship God according to the elements of this world—a thing which Paul
declares to be adverse to Christ (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p46.1"></span>[Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p46.1"></span>). On the other hand, the mode in which they
lay consciences under the strict necessity of observing whatever they
enjoin, is not unknown. When we protest against this, we make common
cause with Paul, who will on no account allow the consciences of
believers to be brought under human bondage.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p47"></span>10. Moreover, the worst of all is, that
when once religion begins to be composed of such vain fictions, the
perversion is immediately succeeded by the abominable depravity with
which our Lord upbraids the Pharisees of making the commandment of God
void through their traditions (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p47.1"></span>[Mt.
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p47.1"></span>). I am unwilling to dispute with our present
legislators in my own words;—let them gain the victory if they can clear
themselves from this accusation of Christ. But how can they do so,
seeing they regard it as immeasurably more wicked to allow the year to
pass without auricular confession, than to have spent it in the greatest
iniquity: to have infected their tongue with a slight tasting of flesh
on Friday, than to have daily polluted the whole body with whoredom: to
have put their hand to honest labour on a day consecrated to some one or
other of their saintlings, than to have constantly employed all their
members in the greatest crimes: for a priest to be united to one in
lawful wedlock, than to be engaged in a thousand adulteries: to have
failed in performing a votive pilgrimage, than to have broken faith in
every promise: not to have expended profusely on the monstrous,
superfluous, and useless luxury of churches, than to have denied the
poor in their greatest necessities: to have passed an idol without
honour, than to have treated the whole human race with contumely: not to
have muttered long unmeaning sentences at certain times, than never to
have framed one proper prayer? What is meant by making the word of God
void by tradition, if this is not done when recommending the ordinances
of God only frigidly and perfunctorily, they nevertheless studiously and
anxiously urge strict obedience to their own ordinances, as if the whole
power of piety was contained in them;—when vindicating the transgression
of the divine Law with trivial satisfactions, they visit the minutest
violation of one of their decrees with no lighter punishment than
imprisonment, exile, fire, or sword?—When neither severe nor inexorable
against the despisers of God, they persecute to extremity, with
implacable hatred, those who despise themselves, and so train all those
whose simplicity they hold in thraldom, that they would sooner see the
whole law of God subverted than one iota of what they call the precepts
of the Church infringed. First, there is a grievous delinquency in this,
that one contemns, judges, and casts off his neighbour for trivial
matters,—matters which, if the judgment of God is to decide, are free.
But now, as if this were a small evil, those frivolous elements of this
world (as Paul terms them in his Epistle to the Galatians, <span

are deemed of more value than the heavenly oracles of God. He who is all
but acquitted for adultery is judged in meat; and he to whom whoredom is
permitted is forbidden to marry. This, forsooth, is all that is gained
by that prevaricating obedience, which only turns away from God to the
same extent that it inclines to men.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p48"></span>11. There are other two grave vices which
we disapprove in these constitutions. First, They prescribe observances
which are in a great measure useless, and are sometimes absurd;
secondly, by the vast multitude of them, pious consciences are
oppressed, and being carried back to a kind of Judaism, so cling to
shadows that they cannot come to Christ. My allegation that they are
useless and absurd will, I know, scarcely be credited by carnal wisdom,
to which they are so pleasing, that the Church seems to be altogether
defaced when they are taken away. But this is just what Paul says, that
they “have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and
neglecting of the body” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p48.1"></span>[Col.
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p48.1"></span>); a most salutary admonition, of which we
ought never to lose sight. Human traditions, he says, deceive by an
appearance of wisdom. Whence this show? Just that being framed by men,
the human mind recognises in them that which is its own, and embraces it
when recognised more willingly than anything, however good, which is
less suitable to its vanity. Secondly, That they seem to be a fit
training to humility, while they keep the minds of men grovelling on the
ground under their yoke; hence they have another recommendation. Lastly,
Because they seem to have a tendency to curb the will of the flesh, and
to subdue it by the rigour of abstinence, they seem to be wisely
devised. But what does Paul say to all this? Does he pluck off those
masks lest the simple should be deluded by a false pretext? Deeming it
sufficient for their refutation to say that they were devices of men, he
passes all these things without refutation, as things of no value. Nay,
because he knew that all fictitious worship is condemned in the Church,
and is the more suspected by believers, the more pleasing it is to the
human mind—because he knew that this false show of outward humility
differs so widely from true humility that it can be easily discerned;
—finally, because he knew that this tutelage is valued at no more than
bodily exercise, he wished the very things which commended human
traditions to the ignorant to be regarded by believers as the refutation
of them.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p49"></span>12. Thus, in the present day, not only
the unlearned vulgar, but every one in proportion as he is inflated by
worldly wisdom, is wonderfully captivated by the glare of ceremonies,
while hypocrites and silly women think that nothing can be imagined
better or more beautiful. But those who thoroughly examine them, and
weigh them more truly according to the rule of godliness, in regard to
the value of all such ceremonies, know, first, that they are trifles of
no utility; secondly, that they are impostures which delude the eyes of
the spectators with empty show. I am speaking of those ceremonies which
the Roman masters will have to be great mysteries, while we know by
experience that they are mere mockery. Nor is it strange that their
authors have gone the length of deluding themselves and others by mere
frivolities, because they have taken their model partly from the dreams
of the Gentiles, partly, like apes, have rashly imitated the ancient
rites of the Mosaic Law, with which we have nothing more to do than with
the sacrifices of animals and other similar things. Assuredly, were
there no other proof, no sane man would expect any good from such an
ill-assorted farrago. And the case itself plainly demonstrates that very
many ceremonies have no other use than to stupify the people rather than
teach them. In like manner, to those new canons which pervert discipline
rather than preserve it, hypocrites attach much importance; but a closer
examination will show that they are nothing but the shadowy and
evanescent phantom of discipline.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p50"></span>13. To come to the second fault, who sees
not that ceremonies, by being heaped one upon another, have grown to
such a multitude, that it is impossible to tolerate them in the
Christian Church? Hence it is, that in ceremonies a strange mixture of
Judaism is apparent, while other observances prove a deadly snare to
pious minds. Augustine complained that in his time, while the precepts
of God were neglected, prejudice everywhere prevailed to such an extent,
that he who touched the ground barefoot during his octave was censured
more severely than he who buried his wits in wine. He complained that
the Church, which God in mercy wished to be free, was so oppressed that
the condition of the Jews was more tolerable (August. <span
id="iv.iv.xi-p50.1"></span>Ep. 119<span id="iv.iv.xi-p50.1"></span>).
Had that holy man fallen on our day, in what terms would he have
deplored the bondage now existing? For the number is tenfold greater,
and each iota is exacted a hundred times more rigidly than then. This is
the usual course; when once those perverse legislators have usurped
authority, they make no end of their commands and prohibitions until
they reach the extreme of harshness. This Paul elegantly intimated by
these words,—“If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world,
why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances? Touch
not, taste not, handle not” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p50.2"></span>[Col.
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p50.2"></span>.md).
For while the word ἅπτεσθαι signifies both to eat and to touch, it is
doubtless taken in the former sense, that there may not be a superfluous
repetition. Here, therefore, he most admirably describes the progress of
false apostles. The way in which superstition begins is this: they
forbid not only to eat, but even to chew gently; after they have
obtained this, they forbid even to taste. This also being yielded to
them, they deem it unlawful to touch even with the finger.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p51"></span>14. We justly condemn this tyranny in
human constitutions, in consequence of which miserable consciences are
strangely tormented by innumerable edicts, and the excessive exaction of
them. Of the canons relating to discipline, we have spoken elsewhere
(*supra*, sec. 12; also chapter 12). What shall I say of ceremonies, the
effect of which has been, that we have almost buried Christ, and
returned to Jewish figures? “Our Lord Christ (says Augustine, <span
id="iv.iv.xi-p51.1"></span>Ep. 118<span id="iv.iv.xi-p51.1"></span>)
bound together the society of his new people by sacraments, very few in
number, most excellent in signification, most easy of observance.” How
widely different this simplicity is from the multitude and variety of
rites in which we see the Church entangled in the present day, cannot
well be told. I am aware of the artifice by which some acute men excuse
this perverseness. They say that there are numbers among us equally rude
as any among the Israelitish people, and that for their sakes has been
introduced this tutelage, which though the stronger may do without,
they, however, ought not to neglect, seeing that it is useful to weak
brethren. I answer, that we are not unaware of what is due to the
weakness of brethren, but, on the other hand, we object that the method
of consulting for the weak is not to bury them under a great mass of
ceremonies. It was not without cause that God distinguished between us
and his ancient people, by training them like children by means of signs
and figures, and training us more simply, without so much external show.
Paul’s words are, “The heir, as long as he is a child,”—“is under tutors
and governors” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p51.2"></span>[Gal.
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p51.2"></span>.md).
This was the state of the Jews under the law. But we are like adults
who, being freed from tutory and curatory, have no need of puerile
rudiments. God certainly foresaw what kind of people he was to have in
his Church, and in what way they were to be governed. Now, he
distinguished between us and the Jews in the way which has been
described. Therefore, it is a foolish method of consulting for the
ignorant to set up the Judaism which Christ has abrogated. This
dissimilitude between the ancient and his new people Christ expressed
when he said to the woman of Samaria, “The hour cometh, and now is, when
the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth”
(<span id="iv.iv.xi-p51.3"></span>[John
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p51.3"></span>). This, no doubt, had always been done; but
the new worshippers differ from the old in this, that while under Moses
the spiritual worship of God was shadowed, and, as it were, entangled by
many ceremonies, these have been abolished, and worship is now more
simple. Those, accordingly, who confound this distinction, subvert the
order instituted and sanctioned by Christ. Therefore you will ask, Are
no ceremonies to be given to the more ignorant, as a help to their
ignorance? I do not say so; for I think that help of this description is
very useful to them. All I contend for is the employment of such a
measure as may illustrate, not obscure Christ. Hence a few ceremonies
have been divinely appointed, and these by no means laborious, in order
that they may evince a present Christ. To the Jews a greater number were
given, that they might be images of an absent Christ. In saying he was
absent, I mean not in power, but in the mode of expression. Therefore,
to secure due moderation, it is necessary to retain that fewness in
number, facility in observance, and significancy of meaning which
consists in clearness. Of what use is it to say that this is not done?
The fact is obvious to every eye.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p52"></span>15. I here say nothing of the pernicious
opinions with which the minds of men are imbued, as that these are
sacrifices by which propitiation is made to God, by which sins are
expiated, by which righteousness and salvation are procured. It will be
maintained that things good in themselves are not vitiated by errors of
this description, since in acts expressly enjoined by God similar errors
may be committed. There is nothing, however, more unbecoming than the
fact, that works devised by the will of man are held in such estimation
as to be thought worthy of eternal life. The works commanded by God
receive a reward, because the Lawgiver himself accepts of them as marks
of obedience. They do not, therefore, take their value from their own
dignity or their own merit, but because God sets this high value on our
obedience toward him. I am here speaking of that perfection of works
which is commanded by God, but is not performed by men. The works of the
law are accepted merely by the free kindness of God, because the
obedience is infirm and defective. But as we are not here considering
how far works avail without Christ, let us omit that question. I again
repeat, as properly belonging to the present subject, that whatever
commendation works have, they have it in respect of obedience, which
alone God regards, as he testifies by the prophet, “I spake not unto
your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of
the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: but this
thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice ” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p52.1"></span>[Jer.
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p52.1"></span>). Of fictitious works he elsewhere speaks,
“Wherefore do you spend your money for that which is not bread”? (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p52.2"></span>[Isa.
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p52.2"></span>;
29:13). Again, “In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p52.3"></span>[Mt.
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p52.3"></span>). They cannot, therefore, excuse themselves
from the charge of allowing wretched people to seek in these external
frivolities a righteousness which they may present to God, and by which
they may stand before the celestial tribunal. Besides, it is not a fault
deservedly stigmatised, that they exhibit unmeaning ceremonies as a kind
of stage-play or magical incantation? For it is certain that all
ceremonies are corrupt and noxious which do not direct men to Christ.
But the ceremonies in use in the Papacy are separated from doctrine, so
that they confine men to signs altogether devoid of meaning. Lastly (as
the belly is an ingenious contriver), it is clear, that many of their
ceremonies have been invented by greedy priests as lures for catching
money. But whatever be their origin, they are all so prostituted to
filthy lucre, that a great part of them must be rescinded if we would
prevent a profane and sacrilegious traffic from being carried on in the
Church.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p53"></span>16. Although I seem not to be delivering
the general doctrine concerning human constitutions, but adapting my
discourse wholly to our own age, yet nothing has been said which may not
be useful to all ages. For whenever men begin the superstitious practice
of worshipping God with their own fictions, all the laws enacted for
this purpose forthwith degenerate into those gross abuses. For the curse
which God denounces—viz. to strike those who worship him with the
doctrines of men with stupor and blindness—is not confined to any one
age, but applies to all ages. The uniform result of this blindness is,
that there is no kind of absurdity escaped by those who, despising the
many admonitions of God, spontaneously entangle themselves in these
deadly fetters. But if, without any regard to circumstances, you would
simply know the character belonging at all times to those human
traditions which ought to be repudiated by the Church, and condemned by
all the godly,56  <span id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) the definition
which we formerly gave is clear and certain—viz. That they include all
the laws enacted by men, without authority from the word of God, for the
purpose either of prescribing the mode of divine worship, or laying a
religious obligation on the conscience, as enjoining things necessary to
salvation. If to one or both of these are added the other evils of
obscuring the clearness of the Gospel by their multitude, of giving no
edification, of being useless and frivolous occupations rather than true
exercises of piety, of being set up for sordid ends and filthy lucre, of
being difficult of observance, and contaminated by pernicious
superstitions, we shall have the means of detecting the quantity of
mischief which they occasion.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p55"></span>17. I understand what their answer will
be—viz. that these traditions are not from themselves, but from God. For
to prevent the Church from erring, it is guided by the Holy Spirit,
whose authority resides in them. This being conceded, it at the same
time follows, that their traditions are revelations by the Holy Spirit,
and cannot be disregarded without impiety and contempt of God. And that
they may not seem to have attempted anything without high authority,
they will have it to be believed that a great part of their observances
is derived from the apostles. For they contend, that in one instance
they have a sufficient proof of what the apostles did in other cases.
The instance is, when the apostles assembled in council, announced to
all the Gentiles as the opinion of the council, that they should
“abstain from pollution of idols, and from fornication, and from things
strangled, and from blood” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p55.1"></span>[Acts
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p55.1"></span>.md).
We have already explained, how, in order to extol themselves, they
falsely assume the name of Church (Chap. 8 sec. 10-13). If, in regard to
the present cause, we remove all masks and glosses (a thing, indeed,
which ought to be our first care, and also is our highest interest), and
consider what kind of Church Christ wishes to have, that we may form and
adapt ourselves to it as a standard, it will readily appear that it is
not a property of the Church to disregard the limits of the word of God,
and wanton and luxuriate in enacting new laws. Does not the law which
was once given to the Church endure for ever? “What things soever I
command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish
from it” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p55.2"></span>[Deut.
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p55.2"></span>). And in another place, “Add thou not unto
his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p55.3"></span>[Prov.
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p55.3"></span>). Since they cannot deny that this was said
to the Church, what else do they proclaim but their contumacy, when,
notwithstanding of such prohibitions, they profess to add to the
doctrine of God, and dare to intermingle their own with it? Far be it
from us to assent to the falsehood by which they offer such insult to
the Church. Let us understand that the name of Church is falsely
pretended wherever men contend for that rash human licence which cannot
confine itself within the boundaries prescribed by the word of God, but
petulantly breaks out, and has recourse to its own inventions. In the
above passage there is nothing involved, nothing obscure, nothing
ambiguous; the whole Church is forbidden to add to, or take from the
word of God, in relation to his worship and salutary precepts. But that
was said merely of the Law, which was succeeded by the Prophets and the
whole Gospel dispensation! This I admit, but I at the same time add,
that these are fulfilments of the Law, rather than additions or
diminutions. Now, if the Lord does not permit anything to be added to,
or taken from the ministry of Moses, though wrapt up, if I may so speak,
in many folds of obscurity, until he furnish a clearer doctrine by his
servants the Prophets, and at last by his beloved Son, why should we not
suppose that we are much more strictly prohibited from making any
addition to the Law, the Prophets, the Psalms, and the Gospel? The Lord
cannot forget himself, and it is long since he declared that nothing is
so offensive to him as to be worshipped by human inventions. Hence those
celebrated declarations of the Prophets, which ought continually to ring
in our ears, “I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the
day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning
burnt-offerings or sacrifices; but this thing commanded I them, saying,
Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and
walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p55.4"></span>[Jer. 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#023)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p55.4"></span>.md).
“I earnestly protested unto your fathers, in the day that I brought them
out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and
protesting, saying, Obey my voice” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p55.5"></span>[Jer.
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p55.5"></span>). There are other passages of the same kind,
but the most noted of all is, “Hath the Lord as great delight in
burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord?
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of
rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
iniquity and idolatry” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p55.6"></span>[1 Sam.
15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p55.6"></span>:
22, 23). It is easy, therefore, to prove, that whenever human inventions
in this respect are defended by the authority of the Church, they cannot
be vindicated from the charge of impiety, and that the name of Church is
falsely assumed.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p56"></span>18. For this reason we freely inveigh
against that tyranny of human traditions which is haughtily obtruded
upon us in the name of the Church. Nor do we hold the Church in derision
(as our adversaries, for the purpose of producing obloquy, unjustly
accuse us), but we attribute to her the praise of obedience, than which
there is none which she acknowledges to be greater. They themselves
rather are emphatically injurious to the Church, in representing her as
contumacious to her Lord, when they pretend that she goes farther than
the word of God allows, to say nothing of their combined impudence and
malice, in continually vociferating about the power of the Church, while
they meanwhile disguise both the command which the Lord has given her,
and the obedience which she owes to the command. But if our wish is as
it ought to be, to agree with the Church, it is of more consequence to
consider and remember the injunction which the Lord has given both to us
and to the Church, to obey him with one consent. For there can be no
doubt that we shall best agree with the Church when we show ourselves
obedient to the Lord in all things. But to ascribe the origin of the
traditions by which the Church has hitherto been oppressed to the
apostles is mere imposition, since the whole substance of the doctrine
of the apostles is, that conscience must not be burdened with new
observances, nor the worship of God contaminated by our inventions.
Then, if any credit is to be given to ancient histories and records,
what they attribute to the apostles was not only unknown to them, but
was never heard by them. Nor let them pretend that most of their
decrees, though not delivered in writing, were received by use and
practice, being things which they could not understand while Christ was
in the world, but which they learned after his ascension, by the
revelation of the Holy Spirit. The meaning of that passage has been
explained elsewhere (Chap. 8 sec. 14). In regard to the present
question, they make themselves truly ridiculous, seeing it is manifest
that all those mysteries which so long were undiscovered by the
apostles, are partly Jewish or Gentile observances, the former of which
had anciently been promulgated among the Jews, and the latter among all
the Gentiles, partly absurd gesticulations and empty ceremonies, which
stupid priests, who have neither sense nor letters, can duly perform;
nay, which children and mountebanks perform so appropriately, that it
seems impossible to have fitter priests for such sacrifices. If there
were no records, men of sense would judge from the very nature of the
case, that such a mass of rites and observances did not rush into the
Church all at once, but crept in gradually. For though the venerable
bishops, who were nearest in time to the apostles, introduced some
things pertaining to order and discipline, those who came after them,
and those after them again, had not enough of consideration, while they
had too much curiosity and cupidity, he who came last always vying in
foolish emulation with his predecessors, so as not to be surpassed in
the invention of novelties. And because there was a danger that these
inventions, from which they anticipated praise from posterity, might
soon become obsolete, they were much more rigorous in insisting on the
observance of them. This false zeal has produced a great part of the
rites which these men represent as apostolical. This history attests.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p57"></span>19. And not to become prolix, by giving a
catalogue of all, we shall be contented with one example. Under the
apostles there was great simplicity in administering the Lord’s Supper.
Their immediate successors made some additions to the dignity of the
ordinance, which are not to be disapproved. Afterwards came foolish
imitators, who, by ever and anon patching various fragments together,
have left us those sacerdotal vestments which we see in the mass, those
altar ornaments, those gesticulations, and whole farrago of useless
observances.56  <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md) But they object,
that in old time the persuasion was, that those things which were done
with the consent of the whole Church proceeded from the apostles. Of
this they quote Augustine as a witness. I will give the explanation in
the very words of Augustine. “Those things which are observed over the
whole world we may understand to have been appointed either by the
apostles themselves, or by general councils, whose authority in the
Church is most beneficial, as the annual solemn celebration of our
Lord’s passion, resurrection, and ascension to heaven, and of the
descent of the Holy Spirit, and any other occurrence observed by the
whole Church wherever it exists” (August. <span
id="iv.iv.xi-p58.1"></span>Ep. 118<span id="iv.iv.xi-p58.1"></span>). In
giving so few examples, who sees not that he meant to refer the
observances then in use to authors deserving of faith and
reverence;—observances few and sober, by which it was expedient that the
order of the Church should be maintained? How widely does this differ
from the view of our Roman masters, who insist that there is no paltry
ceremony among them which is not apostolical?

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p59"></span>20. Not to be tedious, I will give only
one example. Should any one ask them where they get their holy water,
they will at once answer,—from the apostles. As if I did not know who
the Roman bishop is, to whom history ascribes the invention, and who, if
he had admitted the apostles to his council, assuredly never would have
adulterated baptism by a foreign and unseasonable symbol; although it
does not seem probable to me that the origin of that consecration is so
ancient as is there recorded. For when Augustine says (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p59.1"></span>Ep. 118<span id="iv.iv.xi-p59.1"></span>)
that certain churches in his day rejected the formal imitation of Christ
in the washing of feet, lest that rite should seem to pertain to
baptism, he intimates that there was then no kind of washing which had
any resemblance to baptism. Be this as it may, I will never admit that
the apostolic spirit gave rise to that daily sign by which baptism,
while brought back to remembrance, is in a manner repeated. I attach no
importance to the fact, that Augustine elsewhere ascribes other things
to the apostles. For as he has nothing better than conjecture, it is not
sufficient for forming a judgment concerning a matter of so much moment.
Lastly, though we should grant that the things which he mentions are
derived from the apostolic age, there is a great difference between
instituting some exercise of piety, which believers may use with a free
conscience, or may abstain from if they think the observance not to be
useful, and enacting a law which brings the conscience into bondage.
Now, indeed, whoever is the author from whom they are derived, since we
see the great abuses to which they have led, there is nothing to prevent
us from abrogating them without any imputation on him, since he never
recommended them in such a way as to lay us under a fixed and immovable
obligation to observe them.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p60"></span>21. It gives them no great help, in
defending their tyranny, to pretend the example of the apostles. The
apostles and elders of the primitive Church, according to them,
sanctioned a decree without any authority from Christ, by which they
commanded all the Gentiles to abstain from meat offered to idols, from
things strangled, and from blood (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p60.1"></span>[Acts
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p60.1"></span>). If this was lawful for them, why should
not their successors be allowed to imitate the example as often as
occasion requires? Would that they would always imitate them both in
this and in other matters! For I am ready to prove, on valid grounds,
that here nothing new has been instituted or decreed by the apostles.
For when Peter declares in that council, that God is tempted if a yoke
is laid on the necks of the disciples, he overthrows his own argument if
he afterwards allows a yoke to be imposed on them. But it is imposed if
the apostles, on their own authority, prohibit the Gentiles from
touching meat offered to idols, things strangled, and blood. The
difficulty still remains, that they seem nevertheless to prohibit them.
But this will easily be removed by attending more closely to the meaning
of their decree. The first thing in order, and the chief thing in
importance, is, that the Gentiles were to retain their liberty, which
was not to be disturbed, and that they were not to be annoyed with the
observances of the Law. As yet, the decree is all in our favour. The
reservation which immediately follows is not a new law enacted by the
apostles, but a divine and eternal command of God against the violation
of charity, which does not detract one iota from that liberty. It only
reminds the Gentiles how they are to accommodate themselves to their
brother, and to not abuse their liberty for an occasion of offence. Let
the second head, therefore, be, that the Gentiles are to use an
innoxious liberty, giving no offence to the brethren. Still, however,
they prescribe some certain thing—viz. they show and point out, as was
expedient at the time, what those things are by which they may give
offence to their brethren, that they may avoid them; but they add no
novelty of their own to the eternal law of God, which forbids the
offence of brethren.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p61"></span>22. As in the case where faithful
pastors, presiding over churches not yet well constituted, should
intimate to their flocks not to eat flesh on Friday until the weak among
whom they live become strong, or to work on a holiday, or any other
similar things, although, when superstition is laid aside, these matters
are in themselves indifferent, still, where offence is given to the
brethren, they cannot be done without sin; so there are times when
believers cannot set this example before weak brethren without most
grievously wounding their consciences. Who but a slanderer would say
that a new law is enacted by those who, it is evident, only guard
against scandals which their Master has distinctly forbidden? But
nothing more than this can be said of the apostles, who had no other end
in view, in removing grounds of offence, than to enforce the divine Law,
which prohibits offence; as if they had said, The Lord hath commanded
you not to hurt a weak brother; but meats offered to idols, things
strangled, and blood, ye cannot eat, without offending weak brethren;
we, therefore, require you, in the word of the Lord, not to eat with
offence. And to prove that the apostles had respect to this, the best
witness is Paul, who writes as follows, undoubtedly according to the
sentiments of the council: “As concerning, therefore, the eating of
those things which are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an
idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but
one.”—“Howbeit, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with
conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an
idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.”—“But take heed lest
by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to them that
are weak” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p61.1"></span>[1 Cor.
8:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p61.1"></span>). Any one who duly considers these things
will not be imposed upon by the gloss which these men employ when, as a
cloak to their tyranny, they pretend that the apostles had begun by
their decree to infringe the liberty of the Church. But that they may be
unable to escape without confessing the accuracy of this explanation,
let them tell me by what authority they have dared to abrogate this very
decree. It was, it seems, because there was no longer any danger of
those offences and dissensions which the apostles wished to obviate, and
they knew that the law was to be judged by its end. Seeing, therefore,
the law was passed with a view to charity, there is nothing prescribed
in it except in so far as required by charity. In confessing that the
transgression of this law is nothing but a violation of charity, do they
not at the same time acknowledge that it was not some adventitious
supplement to the law of God, but a genuine and simple adaptation of it
to the times and manners for which it was destined?

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p62"></span>23. But though such laws are hundreds of
times unjust and injurious to us, still they contend that they are to be
heard without exception; for the thing asked of us is not to consent to
errors, but only to submit to the strict commands of those set over
us,—commands which we are not at liberty to decline (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.1"></span>[1 Pet.
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.1"></span>). But here also the Lord comes to the
succour of his word, and frees us from this bondage by asserting the
liberty which he has purchased for us by his sacred blood, and the
benefit of which he has more than once attested by his word. For the
thing required of us is not (as they maliciously pretend) to endure some
grievous oppression in our body, but to be tortured in our consciences,
and brought into bondage: in other words, robbed of the benefits of
Christ’s blood. Let us omit this, however, as if it were irrelevant to
the point. Do we think it a small matter that the Lord is deprived of
his kingdom which he so strictly claims for himself? Now, he is deprived
of it as often as he is worshipped with laws of human invention, since
his will is to be sole legislator of his worship. And lest any one
should consider this as of small moment, let us hear how the Lord
himself estimates it. “Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their
mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart
far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:
therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among the
people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of their
wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall
be hid” (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p62.2"></span>[Isaiah
29:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.2"></span>). And in another place, “But in vain do they
worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.3"></span>[Mt.
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.3"></span>). And, indeed, when the children of Israel
polluted themselves with manifold idolatries, the cause of the whole
evil is ascribed to that impure mixture caused by their disregarding the
commandments of God, and framing new modes of worship. Accordingly,
sacred history relates that the new inhabitants who had been brought by
the king of Assyria from Babylon to inhabit Samaria were torn and
destroyed by wild beasts, because they knew not the judgment or statutes
of the God of that land (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p62.4"></span>[2 Kings
17:24-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.4"></span>). Though they had done nothing wrong in
ceremonies, still their empty show could not have been approved by God.
Meanwhile he ceased not to punish them for the violation of his worship
by the introduction of fictions alien from his word. Hence it is
afterwards said that, terrified by the punishment, they adopted the
rites prescribed in the Law; but as they did not yet worship God purely,
it is twice repeated that they feared him and feared not. Hence we infer
that part of the reverence due to him consists in worshipping him simply
in the way which he commands, without mingling any inventions of our
own. And, accordingly, pious princes are repeatedly praised (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.5"></span>[2 Kings
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p62.5"></span>,
&c.) for acting according to all his precepts, and not declining either
to the right hand or the left. I go further: although there be no open
manifestation of impiety in fictitious worship, it is strictly condemned
by the Spirit, inasmuch as it is a departure from the command of God.
The altar of Ahaz, a model of which had been brought from Damascus
(<span id="iv.iv.xi-p62.6"></span>[2 Kings
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.6"></span>), might have seemed to give additional
ornament to the temple, seeing it was his intention there to offer
sacrifices to God only, and to do it more splendidly than at the first
ancient altar: yet we see how the Spirit detests the audacious attempt,
for no other reasons but because human inventions are in the worship of
God impure corruptions. And the more clearly the will of God has been
manifested to us, the less excusable is our petulance in attempting
anything. Accordingly, the guilt of Manasses is aggravated by the
circumstance of having erected a new altar at Jerusalem, of which the
Lord said, “In Jerusalem will I put my name” (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p62.7"></span>[2 Kings
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p62.7"></span>.md),
because the authority of God was thereby professedly rejected.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p63"></span>24. Many wonder why God threatens so
sternly that he will bring astonishment on the people who worship him
with the commandments of men, and declares that it is in vain to worship
him with the commandments of men. But if they would consider what it is
in the matter of religion, that is, of heavenly wisdom, to depend on God
alone, they would, at the same time, see that it is not on slight
grounds the Lord abominates perverse service of this description, which
is offered him at the caprice of the human will. For although there is
some show of humility in the obedience of those who obey such laws in
worshipping God, yet they are by no means humble, since they prescribe
to him the very laws which they observe. This is the reason why Paul
would have us so carefully to beware of being deceived by the traditions
of men, and what is called ἐθελοθρησκεία, that is, voluntary worship,
worship devised by men without sanction from God. Thus it is, indeed: we
must be fools in regard to our own wisdom and all the wisdom of men, in
order that we may allow him alone to be wise. This course is by no means
observed by those who seek to approve themselves to him by paltry
observances of man’s devising, and, as it were, against his will obtrude
upon him a prevaricating obedience which is yielded to men. This is the
course which has been pursued for several ages, and within our own
recollection, and is still pursued in the present day in those places in
which the power of the creature is more than that of the Creator, where
religion (if religion it deserves to be called) is polluted with more
numerous, and more absurd superstitions, than ever Paganism was. For
what could human sense produce but things carnal and fatuous, and
savouring of their authors?

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p64"></span>25. When the patrons of superstition
cloak them, by pretending that Samuel sacrificed in Ramath, and though
he did so contrary to the Law, yet pleased God (l Sam 7:17), it is easy
to answer, that he did not set up any second altar in opposition to the
only true one; but, as the place for the Ark of the Covenant had not
been fixed, he sacrificed in the town where he dwelt, as being the most
convenient. It certainly never was the intention of the holy prophet to
make any innovation in sacred things, in regard to which the Lord had so
strictly forbidden addition or diminution. The case of Manoah I consider
to have been extraordinary and special. He, though a private man,
offered sacrifice to God, and did it not without approbation, because he
did it not from a rash movement of his own mind, but by divine
inspiration (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p64.1"></span>[Judges
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p64.1"></span>). How much God abominates all the devices of
men in his worship, we have a striking proof in the case of one not
inferior to Manoah—viz. Gideon, whose ephod brought ruin not only on
himself and his family, but on the whole people (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p64.2"></span>[Judges
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p64.2"></span>). In short, every adventitious invention, by
which men desire to worship God, is nothing else than a pollution of
true holiness.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p65"></span>26. Why then, they ask, did Christ say
that the intolerable burdens, imposed by Scribes and Pharisees, were to
be borne? (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p65.1"></span>[Mt.
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p65.1"></span>.md)
Nay, rather, why did he say in another place that we were to beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees? (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p65.2"></span>[Mt.
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p65.2"></span>.md)
meaning by leaven, as the Evangelist Matthew explains it, whatever of
human doctrine is mingled with the pure word of God. What can be plainer
than that we are enjoined to shun and beware of their whole doctrine?
From this it is most certain, that in the other passage our Lord never
meant that the consciences of his people were to be harassed by the mere
traditions of the Pharisees. And the words themselves, unless when
wrested, have no such meaning. Our Lord, indeed, beginning to inveigh
against the manners of the Pharisees, first instructs his hearers
simply, that though they saw nothing to follow in the lives of the
Pharisees, they should not, however, cease to do what they verbally
taught when they sat in the seat of Moses, that is, to expound the Law.
All he meant, therefore, was to guard the common people against being
led by the bad example of their teachers to despise doctrine. But as
some are not at all moved by reason, and always require authority, I
will quote a passage from Augustine, in which the very same thing is
expressed. “The Lord’s sheepfold has persons set over it, of whom some
are faithful, others hirelings. Those who are faithful are true
shepherds; learn, however, that hirelings also are necessary. For many
in the Church, pursuing temporal advantages, preach Christ, and the
voice of Christ is heard by them, and the sheep follow not a hireling,
but the shepherd by means of a hireling. Learn that hirelings were
pointed out by the Lord himself. The Scribes and Pharisees, says he, sit
in Moses’ seat; what they tell you, do, but what they do, do ye not.
What is this but to say, Hear the voice of the shepherd by means of
hirelings? Sitting in the chair, they teach the Law of God, and
therefore God teaches by them; but if they choose to teach their own,
hear not, do not.” Thus far Augustine. (August. in Joann. Tract. 46)

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p66"></span>27. But as very many ignorant persons, on
hearing that it is impious to bind the conscience, and vain to worship
God with human traditions, apply one blot to all the laws by which the
order of the Church is established, it will be proper to obviate their
error. Here, indeed, the danger of mistake is great: for it is not easy
to see at first sight how widely the two things differ. But I will, in a
few words, make the matter so clear, that no one will be imposed upon by
the resemblance. First, then, let us understand that if in every human
society some kind of government is necessary to insure the common peace
and maintain concord, if in transacting business some form must always
be observed, which public decency, and hence humanity itself, require us
not to disregard, this ought especially to be observed in churches,
which are best sustained by a constitution in all respects well ordered,
and without which concord can have no existence. Wherefore, if we would
provide for the safety of the Church, we must always carefully attend to
Paul’s injunction, that all things be done decently and in order (<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p66.1"></span>[1 Cor.
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xi-p66.1"></span>). But seeing there is such diversity in the
manners of men, such variety in their minds, such repugnance in their
judgments and dispositions, no policy is sufficiently firm unless
fortified by certain laws, nor can any rite be observed without a fixed
form. So far, therefore, are we from condemning the laws which conduce
to this, that we hold that the removal of them would unnerve the Church,
deface and dissipate it entirely. For Paul’s injunction, that all things
be done decently and in order, cannot be observed unless order and
decency be secured by the addition of ordinances, as a kind of bonds. In
these ordinances, however, we must always attend to the exception, that
they must not be thought necessary to salvation, nor lay the conscience
under a religious obligation; they must not be compared to the worship
of God, nor substituted for piety.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p67"></span>28. We have, therefore, a most excellent
and sure mark to distinguish between those impious constitutions (by
which, as we have said, true religion is overthrown, and conscience
subverted) and the legitimate observances of the Church, if we remember
that one of two things, or both together, are always intended—viz. that
in the sacred assembly of the faithful, all things may be done decently,
and with becoming dignity, and that human society may be maintained in
order by certain bonds, as it were, of moderation and humanity. For when
a law is understood to have been made for the sake of public decency,
there is no room for the superstition into which those fall who measure
the worship of God by human inventions. On the other hand, when a law is
known to be intended for common use, that false idea of its obligation
and necessity, which gives great alarm to the conscience, when
traditions are deemed necessary to salvation, is overthrown; since
nothing here is sought but the maintenance of charity by a common
office. But it may be proper to explain more clearly what is meant by
the decency which Paul commends, and also what is comprehended under
order. And the object of decency is, partly that by the use of rites,
which produce reverence in sacred matters, we may be excited to piety,
and partly that the modesty and gravity which ought to be seen in all
honourable actions may here especially be conspicuous. In order, the
first thing is, that those who preside know the law and rule of right
government, while those who are governed be accustomed to obedience and
right discipline. The second thing is, that by duly arranging the state
of the Church, provision be made for peace and tranquillity.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p68"></span>29. We shall not, therefore, give the
name of decency to that which only ministers an empty pleasure: such,
for example, as is seen in that theatrical display which the Papists
exhibit in their public service, where nothing appears but a mask of
useless splendour, and luxury without any fruit. But we give the name of
decency to that which, suited to the reverence of sacred mysteries,
forms a fit exercise for piety, or at least gives an ornament adapted to
the action, and is not without fruit, but reminds believers of the great
modesty, seriousness, and reverence, with which sacred things ought to
be treated. Moreover, ceremonies, in order to be exercises of piety,
must lead us directly to Christ. In like manner, we shall not make order
consist in that nugatory pomp which gives nothing but evanescent
splendour, but in that arrangement which removes all confusion,
barbarism, contumacy, all turbulence and dissension. Of the former class
we have examples (<span id="iv.iv.xi-p68.1"></span>[1 Cor.
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#005.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#021)<span id="iv.iv.xi-p68.1"></span>.md),
where Paul says, that profane entertainments must not be intermingled
with the sacred Supper of the Lord; that women must not appear in public
uncovered. And there are many other things which we have in daily
practice, such as praying on our knees, and with our head uncovered,
administering the sacraments of the Lord, not sordidly, but with some
degree of dignity; employing some degree of solemnity in the burial of
our dead, and so forth. In the other class are the hours set apart for
public prayer, sermon, and solemn services; during sermon, quiet and
silence, fixed places, singing of hymns, days set apart for the
celebration of the Lord’s Supper, the prohibition of Paul against women
teaching in the Church, and such like. To the same list especially may
be referred those things which preserve discipline, as catechising,
ecclesiastical censures, excommunication, fastings, &c. Thus all
ecclesiastical constitutions, which we admit to be sacred and salutary,
may be reduced to two heads, the one relating to rites and ceremonies,
the other to discipline and peace.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p69"></span>30. But as there is here a danger, on the
one hand, lest false bishops should thence derive a pretext for their
impious and tyrannical laws, and, on the other, lest some, too apt to
take alarm, should, from fear of the above evils, leave no place for
laws, however holy, it may here be proper to declare, that I approve of
those human constitutions only which are founded on the authority of
God, and derived from Scripture, and are therefore altogether divine.
Let us take, for example, the bending of the knee which is made in
public prayer. It is asked, whether this is a human tradition, which any
one is at liberty to repudiate or neglect? I say, that it is human, and
that at the same time it is divine. It is of God, inasmuch as it is a
part of that decency, the care and observance of which is recommended by
the apostle; and it is of men, inasmuch as it specially determines what
was indicated in general, rather than expounded. From this one example,
we may judge what is to be thought of the whole class—viz. that the
whole sum of righteousness, and all the parts of divine worship, and
everything necessary to salvation, the Lord has faithfully comprehended,
and clearly unfolded, in his sacred oracles, so that in them he alone is
the only Master to be heard. But as in external discipline and
ceremonies, he has not been pleased to prescribe every particular that
we ought to observe (he foresaw that this depended on the nature of the
times, and that one form would not suit all ages), in them we must have
recourse to the general rules which he has given, employing them to test
whatever the necessity of the Church may require to be enjoined for
order and decency. Lastly, as he has not delivered any express command,
because things of this nature are not necessary to salvation, and, for
the edification of the Church, should be accommodated to the varying
circumstances of each age and nation, it will be proper, as the interest
of the Church may require, to change and abrogate the old, as well as to
introduce new forms. I confess, indeed, that we are not to innovate
rashly or incessantly, or for trivial causes. Charity is the best judge
of what tends to hurt or to edify: if we allow her to be guide, all
things will be safe.

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p70"></span>31. Things which have been appointed
according to this rule, it is the duty of the Christian people to
observe with a free conscience indeed, and without superstition, but
also with a pious and ready inclination to obey. They are not to hold
them in contempt, nor pass them by with careless indifference, far less
openly to violate them in pride and contumacy. You will ask, What
liberty of conscience will there be in such cautious observances? Nay,
this liberty will admirably appear when we shall hold that these are not
fixed and perpetual obligations to which we are astricted, but external
rudiments for human infirmity, which, though we do not all need, we,
however, all use, because we are bound to cherish mutual charity towards
each other. This we may recognise in the examples given above. What? Is
religion placed in a woman’s bonnet, so that it is unlawful for her to
go out with her head uncovered? Is her silence fixed by a decree which
cannot be violated without the greatest wickedness? Is there any mystery
in bending the knee, or in burying a dead body, which cannot be omitted
without a crime? By no means. For should a woman require to make such
haste in assisting a neighbour that she has not time to cover her head,
she sins not in running out with her head uncovered. And there are some
occasions on which it is not less seasonable for her to speak than on
others to be silent. Nothing, moreover, forbids him who, from disease,
cannot bend his knees, to pray standing. In fine, it is better to bury a
dead man quickly, than from want of grave-clothes, or the absence of
those who should attend the funeral, to wait till it rot away unburied.
Nevertheless, in those matters the custom and institutions of the
country, in short, humanity and the rules of modesty itself, declare
what is to be done or avoided. Here, if any error is committed through
imprudence or forgetfulness, no crime is perpetrated; but if this is
done from contempt, such contumacy must be disapproved. In like manner,
it is of no consequence what the days and hours are, what the nature of
the edifices, and what psalms are sung on each day. But it is proper
that there should be certain days and stated hours, and a place fit for
receiving all, if any regard is had to the preservation of peace. For
what a seed-bed of quarrels will confusion in such matters be, if every
one is allowed at pleasure to alter what pertains to common order? All
will not be satisfied with the same course if matters, placed as it were
on debateable ground, are left to the determination of individuals. But
if any one here becomes clamorous, and would be wiser than he ought, let
him consider how he will approve his moroseness to the Lord. Paul’s
answer ought to satisfy us, “If any man seem to be contentious, we have
no such custom, neither the churches of God.”

<span id="iv.iv.xi-p71"></span>32. Moreover, we must use the utmost
diligence to prevent any error from creeping in which may either taint
or sully this pure use. In this we shall succeed, if whatever
observances we use are manifestly useful, and very few in number;
especially if to this is added the teaching of a faithful pastor, which
may prevent access to erroneous opinions. The effect of this procedure
is, that in all these matters each retains his freedom, and yet at the
same time voluntarily subjects it to a kind of necessity, in so far as
the *decency* of which we have spoken or charity demands. Next, that in
the observance of these things we may not fall into any superstition,
nor rigidly require too much from others, let us not imagine that the
worship of God is improved by a multitude of ceremonies: let not church
despise church because of a difference in external discipline. Lastly,
instead of here laying down any perpetual law for ourselves, let us
refer the whole end and use of observances to the edification of the
Church, at whose request let us without offence allow not only something
to be changed, but even observances which were formerly in use to be
inverted. For the present age is a proof that the nature of times allows
that certain rites, not otherwise impious or unbecoming, may be
abrogated according to circumstances. Such was the ignorance and
blindness of former times; with such erroneous ideas and pertinacious
zeal did churches formerly cling to ceremonies, that they can scarcely
be purified from monstrous superstitions without the removal of many
ceremonies which were formerly established, not without cause, and which
in themselves are not chargeable with any impiety.
