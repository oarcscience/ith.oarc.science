### <span id="iv.i.i-p0.1"></span>ARGUMENT.

<span id="iv.i.i-p1"></span>The First Book treats of the knowledge of
God the Creator. But as it is in the creation of man that the divine
perfections are best displayed, so man also is made the subject of
discourse. Thus the whole book divides itself into two principal
heads—the former relating to the knowledge of God, and the latter to the
knowledge of man. In the first chapter, these are considered jointly;
and in each of the following chapters, separately: occasionally,
however, intermingled with other matters which refer to one or other of
the heads; *e.g.*, the discussions concerning Scripture and images,
falling under the former head, and the other three concerning the
creation of the world, the holy angels and devils, falling under the
latter. The last point discussed—viz. the method of the divine
government, relates to both.

<span id="iv.i.i-p2"></span>With regard to the former head—viz. the
knowledge of God, it is shown, in the first place, what the kind of
knowledge is which God requires, Chap. 2. And, in the second place
(Chap. 3-9), where this knowledge must be sought, namely, not in man;
because, although naturally implanted in the human mind, it is stifled,
partly by ignorance, partly by evil intent, Chap. 3 and 4; not in the
frame of the world: because, although it shines most clearly there, we
are so stupid that these manifestations, however perspicuous, pass away
without any beneficial result, Chap. 5; but in Scripture (Chap. 6),
which is treated of, Chap. 7-9. In the third place, it is shown what the
character of God is, Chap. 10. In the fourth place, how impious it is to
give a visible form to God (here images, the worship of them, and its
origin, are considered), Chap. 11. In the fifth place, it is shown that
God is to be solely and wholly worshipped, Chap. 12. Lastly, Chap. 13
treats of the unity of the divine essence, and the distinction of three
persons.

<span id="iv.i.i-p3"></span>With regard to the latter head—viz. the
knowledge of man, first, Chap. 14 treats of the creation of the world,
and of good and bad angels (these all having reference to man). And then
Chap. 15, taking up the subject of man himself, examines his nature and
his powers.

<span id="iv.i.i-p4"></span>The better to illustrate the nature both of
God and man, the three remaining Chapters—viz. 16-18, proceed to treat
of the general government of the world, and particularly of human
actions, in opposition to fortune and fate, explaining both the doctrine
and its use. In conclusion, it is shown, that though God employs the
instrumentality of the wicked, he is pure from sin and from taint of
every kind.
