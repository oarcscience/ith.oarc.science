### <span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 25.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p1"></span>OF THE LAST RESURRECTION.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>There are four principal heads in this
chapter,—I. The utility, necessity, truth, and irrefragable evidence of
the orthodox doctrine of a final resurrection—a doctrine unknown to
philosophers, sec. 1-4. II. Refutation of the objections to this
doctrine by Atheists, Sadducees, Chiliasts, and other fanatics, sec.
5-7. III. The nature of the final resurrection explained, sec. 8, 9. IV.
Of the eternal felicity of the elect, and the everlasting misery of the
reprobate.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p3"></span>*Sections*.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p4"></span>1. For invincible perseverance in our
calling, it is necessary to be animated with the blessed hope of our
Savior’s final advent.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p5"></span>2. The perfect happiness reserved for
the elect at the final resurrection unknown to philosophers.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p6"></span>3. The truth and necessity of this
doctrine of a final resurrection. To confirm our belief in it we have,
1. The example of Christ; and, 2. The omnipotence of God. There is an
inseparable connection between us and our risen Savior. The bodies of
the elect must be conformed to the body of their Head. It is now in
heaven. Therefore, our bodies also must rise, and, reanimated by their
souls, reign with Christ in heaven. The resurrection of Christ a pledge
of ours.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p7"></span>4. As God is omnipotent, he can raise
the dead. Resurrection explained by a natural process. The vision of dry
bones.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p8"></span>5. Second part of the chapter, refuting
objections to the doctrine of resurrection. 1. Atheists. 2. Sadducees.
3. Chiliasts. Their evasion. Various answers. 4. Universalists. Answer.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p9"></span>6. Objections continued. 5. Some
speculators who imagine that death destroys the whole man. Refutation.
The condition and abode of souls from death till the last day. What
meant by the bosom of Abraham.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p10"></span>7. Refutation of some weak men and
Manichees, pretending that new bodies are to be given. Refutation
confirmed by various arguments and passages of Scripture.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p11"></span>8. Refutation of the fiction of new
bodies continued.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p12"></span>9. Shall the wicked rise again? Answer
in the affirmative. Why the wicked shall rise again. Why resurrection
promised to the elect only.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p13"></span>10. The last part of the chapter,
treating of eternal felicity; 1 Its excellence transcends our capacity.
Rules to be observed. The glory of all the saints will not be equal.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p14"></span>11. Without rewarding questions which
merely puzzle, an answer given to some which are not without use.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p15"></span>12. As the happiness of the elect, so
the misery of the reprobate, will be without measure, and without end.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p16"></span>1. Although Christ, the Sun of
righteousness, shining upon us through the gospel, has, as Paul
declares, after conquering death, given us the light of life; and hence
on believing we are said to have passed from “death unto life,” being no
longer strangers and pilgrims, but fellow citizens with the saints, and
of the household of God, who has made us sit with his only begotten Son
in heavenly places, so that nothing is wanting to our complete felicity;
yet, lest we should feel it grievous to be exercised under a hard
warfare, as if the victory obtained by Christ had produced no fruit, we
must attend to what is elsewhere taught concerning the nature of hope.
For since we hope for what we see not, and faith, as is said in another
passage, is “the evidence of things not seen” so long as we are
imprisoned in the body we are absent from the Lord. For which reason
Paul says, “Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When
Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with
him in glory.” Our present condition, therefore, requires us to “live
soberly, righteously, and godly;” “looking for that blessed hope, and
the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ.”
Here there is need of no ordinary patience, lest, worn out with fatigue,
we either turn backwards or abandon our post. Wherefore, all that has
hitherto been said of our salvation calls upon us to raise our minds
towards heaven, that, as Peter exhorts, though we now see not Christ,
“yet believing,” we may “rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
glory,” receiving the end of our faith, even the salvation of our
souls.51  <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) For this reason Paul
says, that the faith and charity of the saints have respect to the faith
and hope which is laid up for them in heaven (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p17.9"></span>[Col.
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p17.9"></span>). When we thus keep our eyes fixed upon
Christ in heaven, and nothing on earth prevents us from directing them
to the promised blessedness, there is a true fulfillment of the saying,
“where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p17.10"></span>[Mt.
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p17.10"></span>). Hence the reason why faith is so rare
in the world; nothing being more difficult for our sluggishness than to
surmount innumerable obstacles in striving for the prize of our high
calling. To the immense load of miseries which almost overwhelm us, are
added the jeers of profane men, who assail us for our simplicity, when
spontaneously renouncing the allurements of the present life we seem, in
seeking a happiness which lies hid from us, to catch at a fleeting
shadow. In short, we are beset above and below, behind and before, with
violent temptations, which our minds would be altogether unable to
withstand, were they not set free from earthly objects and devoted to
the heavenly life, though apparently remote from us. Wherefore, he alone
has made solid progress in the Gospel who has acquired the habit of
meditating continually on a blessed resurrection.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p18"></span>2. In ancient times philosophers
discoursed, and even debated with each other, concerning the chief good:
none, however, except Plato acknowledged that it consisted in union with
God. He could not, however, form even an imperfect idea of its true
nature; nor is this strange, as he had learned nothing of the sacred
bond of that union. We even in this our earthly pilgrimage know wherein
our perfect and only felicity consists,—a felicity which, while we long
for it, daily inflames our hearts more and more, until we attain to full
fruition. Therefore I said, that none participate in the benefits of
Christ save those who raise their minds to the resurrection. This,
accordingly, is the mark which Paul sets before believers, and at which
he says they are to aim, forgetting every thing until they reach its
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p18.1"></span>[Phil.
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p18.1"></span>). The more strenuously, therefore, must
we contend for it, lest if the world engross us we be severely punished
for our sloth.51  <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) Accordingly,
he in another passage distinguishes believers by this mark, that their
conversation is in heaven, from whence they look for the Savior (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p19.1"></span>[Phil.
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p19.1"></span>). And that they may not faint in their
course, he associates all the other creatures with them. As shapeless
ruins are everywhere seen, he says, that all things in heaven and earth
struggle for renovation. For since Adam by his fall destroyed the proper
order of nature, the creatures groan under the servitude to which they
have been subjected through his sin; not that they are at all endued
with sense, but that they naturally long for the state of perfection
from which they have fallen. Paul therefore describes them as groaning
and travailing in pain (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p19.2"></span>[Rom.
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p19.2"></span>); so that we who have received the
first-fruits of the Spirit may be ashamed to grovel in our corruption,
instead of at least imitating the inanimate elements which are bearing
the punishment of another’s sin. And in order that he may stimulate us
the more powerfully, he terms the final advent of Christ our
*redemption*. It is true, indeed, that all the parts of our redemption
are already accomplished; but as Christ was once offered for sins (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p19.3"></span>[Heb.
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p19.3"></span>), so he shall again appear without sin
unto salvation. Whatever, then, be the afflictions by which we are
pressed, let this redemption sustain us until its final accomplishment.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20"></span>3. The very importance of the subject
ought to increase our ardor. Paul justly contends, that if Christ rise
not the whole gospel is delusive and vain (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.1"></span>[1 Cor.
15:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.1"></span>); for our condition would be more
miserable than that of other mortals, because we are exposed to much
hatred and insult, and incur danger every hour; nay, are like sheep
destined for slaughter; and hence the authority of the gospel would
fail, not in one part merely, but in its very essence, including both
our adoption and the accomplishment of our salvation. Let us, therefore,
give heed to a matter of all others the most serious, so that no length
of time may produce weariness. I have deferred the brief consideration
to be given of it to this place, that my readers may learn, when they
have received Christ, the author of perfect salvation, to rise higher,
and know that he is clothed with heavenly immortality and glory in order
that the whole body may be rendered conformable to the Head. For thus
the Holy Spirit is ever setting before us in his person an example of
the resurrection. It is difficult to believe that after our bodies have
been consumed with rottenness, they sill rise again at their appointed
time. And hence, while many of the philosophers maintained the
immortality of the soul, few of them assented to the resurrection of the
body. Although in this they were inexcusable, we are thereby reminded
that the subject is too difficult for human apprehension to reach it. To
enable faith to surmount the great difficulty, Scripture furnishes two
auxiliary proofs, the one the likeness of Christ’s resurrection, and the
other the omnipotence of God. Therefore, whenever the subject of the
resurrection is considered, let us think of the case of our Savior, who,
having completed his mortal course in our nature which he had assumed,
obtained immortality, and is now the pledge of our future resurrection.
For in the miseries by which we are beset, we always bear “about in the
body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be
made manifest in our mortal flesh,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.2"></span>[2 Cor.
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.2"></span>). It is not lawful, it is not even
possible, to separate him from us, without dividing him. Hence Paul’s
argument, “If there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not
risen,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.3"></span>[1 Cor.
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.3"></span>); for he assumes it as an acknowledged
principle, that when Christ was subjected to death, and by rising gained
a victory over death, it was not on his own account, but in the Head was
begun what must necessarily be fulfilled in all the members, according
to the degree and order of each. For it would not be proper to be made
equal to him in all respects. It is said in the psalm, “Neither wilt
thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.4"></span>[Ps.
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.4"></span>). Although a portion of this confidence
appertain to us according to the measure bestowed on us, yet the full
effect appeared only in Christ, who, free from all corruption, resumed a
spotless body. Then, that there may be no doubt as to our fellowship
with Christ in a blessed resurrection, and that we may be contented with
this pledge, Paul distinctly affirms that he sits in the heavens, and
will come as a judge on the last day for the express purpose of changing
our vile body, “that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.5"></span>[Phil.
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.5"></span>). For he elsewhere says that God did not
raise up his Son from death to give an isolated specimen of his mighty
power, but that the Spirit exerts the same efficacy in regard to them
that believe; and accordingly he says, that the Spirit when he dwells in
us is life, because the end for which he was given is to quicken our
mortal body (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.6"></span>[Rom.
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.6"></span>; <span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.7"></span>[Col.
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.7"></span>). I briefly glance at subjects which
might be treated more copiously, and deserve to be adorned more
splendidly, and yet in the little I have said I trust pious readers will
find sufficient materials for building up their faith. Christ rose again
that he might have us as partakers with him of future life. He was
raised up by the Father, inasmuch as he was the Head of the Church, from
which he cannot possibly be dissevered. He was raised up by the power of
the Spirit, who also in us performs the office of quickening. In fine,
he was raised up to be the resurrection and the life. But as we have
said, that in this mirror we behold a living image of the resurrection,
so it furnishes a sure evidence to support our minds, provided we faint
not, nor grow weary at the long delay, because it is not ours to measure
the periods of time at our own pleasure; but to rest patiently till God
in his own time renew his kingdom. To this Paul refers when he says,
“But every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits; afterward they
that are Christ’s at his coming,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.8"></span>[1 Cor.
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p20.8"></span>).

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21"></span>But lest any question should be raised
as to the resurrection of Christ on which ours is founded, we see how
often and in what various ways he has borne testimony to it. Scoffing
men will deride the narrative which is given by the Evangelist as a
childish fable. For what importance will they attach to a message which
timid women brings and the disciples almost dead with fear, afterwards
confirm? Why does not Christ rather place the illustrious trophies of
his victory in the midst of the temple and the forum? Why does he not
come forth, and in the presence of Pilate strike terror? Why does he not
show himself alive again to the priests and all Jerusalem? Profane men
will scarcely admit that the witnesses whom he selects are well
qualified. I answer, that though at the commencement their infirmity was
contemptible, yet the whole was directed by the admirable providence of
God, so that partly from love to Christ and religious zeal, partly from
incredulity, those who were lately overcome with fear now hurry to the
sepulchre, not only that they might be eye-witnesses of the fact, but
that they might hear angels announce what they actually saw. How can we
question the veracity of those who regarded what the women told them as
a fable, until they saw the reality? It is not strange that the whole
people and also the governor, after they were furnished with sufficient
evidence for conviction, were not allowed to see Christ or the other
signs (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21.1"></span>[Mt.
27:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#066.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21.1"></span>; 28:11). The sepulchre is sealed,
sentinels keep watch, on the third day the body is not found. The
soldiers are bribed to spread the report that his disciples had stolen
the body. As if they had had the means of deforming a band of soldiers,
or been supplied with weapons, or been trained so as to make such a
daring attempt. But if the soldiers had not courage enough to repel
them, why did they not follow and apprehend some of them by the aid of
the populace? Pilate, therefore, in fact, put his signet to the
resurrection of Christ, and the guards who were placed at the sepulchre
by their silence or falsehood also became heralds of his resurrection.
Meanwhile, the voice of angels was heard, “He is not here, but is
risen,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21.2"></span>[Luke
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21.2"></span>). The celestial splendor plainly shows
that they were not men but angels. Afterwards, if any doubt still
remained, Christ himself removed it. The disciples saw him frequently;
they even touched his hands and his feet, and their unbelief is of no
little avail in confirming our faith. He discoursed to them of the
mysteries of the kingdom of God, and at length, while they beheld,
ascended to heaven. This spectacle was exhibited not to eleven apostles
only, but was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21.3"></span>[1 Cor.
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21.3"></span>). Then by sending the Holy Spirit he gave
a proof not only of life but also of supreme power, as he had foretold,
“It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
Comforter will not come unto you,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21.4"></span>[John
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p21.4"></span>). Paul was not thrown down on the way by
the power of a dead man, but felt that he whom he was opposing was
possessed of sovereign authority. To Stephen he appeared for another
purpose—viz. that he might overcome the fear of death by the certainty
of life. To refuse assent to these numerous and authentic proofs is not
diffidence, but depraved and therefore infatuated obstinacy.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p22"></span>4. We have said that in proving the
resurrection our thoughts must be directed to the immense power of God.
This Paul briefly teaches, when he says that the Lord Jesus Christ
“shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
glorious body, according to the working of that mighty power whereby he
is able even to subdue all things unto himself,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p22.1"></span>[Phil.
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p22.1"></span>). Wherefore, nothing can be more
incongruous than to look here at what can be done naturally when the
subject presented to us is an inestimable miracle, which by its
magnitude absorbs our senses. Paul, however, by producing a proof from
nature, confutes the senselessness of those who deny the resurrection.
“Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die,” &c.
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p22.2"></span>[1 Cor.
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#036.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p22.2"></span>). He says that in seed there is a species
of resurrection, because the crop is produced from corruption. Nor would
the thing be so difficult of belief were we as attentive as we ought to
be to the wonders which meet our eye in every quarter of the world. But
let us remember that none is truly persuaded of the future resurrection
save he who, carried away with admiration gives God the glory.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23"></span>Elated with this convictions Isaiah
exclaims, “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall
they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.1"></span>[Isaiah
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.1"></span>). In desperate circumstances he rises to
God, the author of life, in whose hand are “the issues from death,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.2"></span>[Psalm
68:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.2"></span>). Job also, when liker a dead body than a
living being, trusting to the power of God, hesitates not as if in full
vigor to rise to that day: “I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he
will stand at the latter day upon the earth;” (that is, that he will
there exert his power): “and though after my skin worms destroy this
body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and
mine eyes shall behold, and not another,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.3"></span>[Job
19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.3"></span>). For though some have recourse to a more
subtle interpretation, by which they wrest these passages, as if they
were not to be understood of the resurrection, they only confirm what
they are desirous to overthrow; for holy men, in seeking consolation in
their misfortunes, have recourse for alleviation merely to the
similitude of a resurrection. This is better learned from a passage in
Ezekiel. When the Jews scouted the promise of return, and objected that
the probability of it was not greater than that of the dead coming forth
from the tomb, there is presented to the prophet in vision a field
covered with dry bones, which at the command of God recover sinews and
flesh. Though under that figure he encourages the people to hope for
return, yet the ground of hope is taken from the resurrection, as it is
the special type of all the deliverances which believers experience in
this world. Thus Christ declares that the voice of the Gospel gives
life; but because the Jews did not receive it, he immediately adds,
“Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming in which all that are in the
grave shall hear his voice, and shall come forth,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.4"></span>[John
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.4"></span>). Wherefore, amid all our conflicts let
us exult after the example of Paul, that he who has promised us future
life “is able to keep that” which “is committed unto him,” and thus
glory that there is laid up for us “a crown of righteousness, which the
Lord, the righteous judge, shall give,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.5"></span>[2 Tim.
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.5"></span>; 4:8). Thus all the hardships which we
may endure will be a demonstration of our future life, “seeing it is a
righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble
you; and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall
be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.6"></span>[2 Thess.
1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p23.6"></span>). But we must attend to what he shortly
after adds—viz. that he “shall come to be glorified in his saints, and
to be admired in all them that believe,” by receiving the Gospel.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p24"></span>5. Although the minds of men ought to
be perpetually occupied with this pursuits yet as if they actually
resolved to banish all remembrance of the resurrection, they have called
death the end of all things, the extinction of man. For Solomon
certainly expresses the commonly received opinion when he says “A living
dog is better than a dead lion,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p24.1"></span>[Eccl.
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p24.1"></span>). And again, “Who knoweth the spirit of
man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to
the earth?”51  <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) In all ages a
brutish stupor has prevailed, and, accordingly, it has made its way into
the very Church; for the Sadducees had the hardihood openly to profess
that there was no resurrection, nay, that the soul was mortal (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p25.1"></span>[Mark
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p25.1"></span>; <span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p25.2"></span>[Luke
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p25.2"></span>). But that this gross ignorance might be
no excuse, unbelievers have always by natural instinct had an image of
the resurrection before their eyes. For why the sacred and inviolable
custom of burying, but that it might be the earnest of a new life? Nor
can it be said that it had its origin in error, for the solemnity of
sepulture always prevailed among the holy patriarchs, and God was
pleased that the same custom should continue among the Gentiles, in
order that the image of the resurrection thus presented might shake off
their torpor. But although that ceremony was without profit, yet it is
useful to us if we prudently consider its end; because it is no feeble
refutation of infidelity that all men agreed in professing what none of
them believed. But not only did Satan stupefy the senses of mankind, so
that with their bodies they buried the remembrance of the resurrection;
but he also managed by various fictions so to corrupt this branch of
doctrine that it at length was lost. Not to mention that even in the
days of Paul he began to assail it (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p25.3"></span>[1 Cor.
15](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p25.3"></span>), shortly after the Chiliasts  <span
id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) arose, who limited the reign of Christ
to a thousand years. This fiction is too puerile to need or to deserve
refutation. Nor do they receive any countenance from the Apocalypse,
from which it is known that they extracted a gloss for their error
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p26.1"></span>[Rev.
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p26.1"></span>), since the thousand years there
mentioned refer not to the eternal blessedness of the Church, but only
to the various troubles which await the Church militant in this world.
The whole Scripture proclaims that there will be no end either to the
happiness of the elect, or the punishment of the reprobate. Moreover, in
regard to all things which lie beyond our sight, and far transcend the
reach of our intellect, belief must either be founded on the sure
oracles of God, or altogether renounced. Those who assign only a
thousand years to the children of God to enjoy the inheritance of future
life, observe not how great an insult they offer to Christ and his
kingdom.  <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) If they are not to be
clothed with immortality, then Christ himself, into whose glory they
shall be transformed, has not been received into immortal glory; if
their blessedness is to have an end, the kingdom of Christ, on whose
solid structure it rests, is temporary. In short, they are either most
ignorant of all divine things or they maliciously aim at subverting the
whole grace of God and power of Christ, which cannot have their full
effects unless sin is obliterated, death swallowed up, and eternal life
fully renewed. How stupid and frivolous their fear that too much
severity will be ascribed to God, if the reprobate are doomed to eternal
punishment, even the blind may see. The Lord, forsooth, will be unjust
if he exclude from his kingdom those who, by their ingratitude shall
have rendered themselves unworthy of it. But their sins are temporary
(see Bernard, Epist. 254). I admit it; but then the majesty of God, and
also the justice which they have violated by their sins, are eternal.
Justly, therefore, the memory of their iniquity does not perish. But in
this way the punishment will exceed the measure of the fault. It is
intolerable blasphemy to hold the majesty of God in so little
estimation, as not to regard the contempt of it as of greater
consequence than the destruction of a single soul. But let us have done
with these triflers, that we may not seem (contrary to what we first
observed) to think their dreams deserving of refutation.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28"></span>6. Besides these, other two dreams
have been invented by men who indulge a wicked curiosity. Some, under
the idea that the whole man perishes, have thought that the soul will
rise again with the body; while others, admitting that spirits are
immortal, hold that they will be clothed with new bodies, and thus deny
the resurrection of the flesh. Having already adverted to the former
point when speaking of the creation of man, it will be sufficient again
to remind the reader how groveling an error it is to convert a spirit,
formed after the image of God, into an evanescent breath, which animates
the body only during this fading life, and to reduce the temple of the
Holy Spirit to nothing; in short, to rob of the badge of immortality
that part of ourselves in which the divinity is most Refulgent and the
marks of immortality conspicuous, so as to make the condition of the
body better and more excellent than that of the soul. Very different is
the course taken by Scripture, which compares the body to a tabernacle,
from which it describes us as migrating when we die, because it
estimates us by that part which distinguishes us from the lower animals.
Thus Peter, in reference to his approaching death, says, “Knowing that
shortly I must put off this my tabernacle,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.1"></span>[2 Pet.
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.1"></span>). Paul, again, speaking of believers,
after saying, “If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,
we have a building of God,” adds, “Whilst we are at home in the body, we
are absent from the Lord,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.2"></span>[2 Cor.
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.2"></span>). Did not the soul survive the body, how
could it be present with the Lord on being separated from the body? But
an Apostle removes all doubt when he says that we go “to the spirits of
just men made perfect,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.3"></span>[Heb.
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.3"></span>); by these words meaning, that we are
associated with the holy patriarchs, who, even when dead, cultivate the
same piety, so that we cannot be the members of Christ unless we unite
with them. And did not the soul, when unclothed from the body, retain
its essence, and be capable of beatific glory, our Savior would not have
said to the thief, “Today shalt thou be with me in paradise,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.4"></span>[Luke
23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.4"></span>). Trusting to these clear proofs, let us
doubt not, after the example of our Savior, to commend our spirits to
God when we come to die, or after the example of Stephen, to commit
ourselves to the protection of Christ, who, with good reason, is called
“The Shepherd and Bishop” of our souls (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.5"></span>[Acts
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.5"></span>; <span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.6"></span>[1
Pet. 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.6"></span>). Moreover, to pry curiously into their
intermediate state is neither lawful nor expedient (see Calv.
Psychopannychia). Many greatly torment themselves with discussing what
place they occupy, and whether or not they already enjoy celestial
glory. It is foolish and rash to inquire into hidden things, farther
than God permits us to know. Scripture, after telling that Christ is
present with them, and receives them into paradise (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.7"></span>[John
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p28.7"></span>), and that they are comforted, while the
souls of the reprobate suffer the torments which they have merited goes
no farther. What teacher or doctor will reveal to us what God has
concealed? As to the place of abode, the question is not less futile and
inept, since we know that the dimension of the soul is not the same as
that of the body.51  <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) When the
abode of blessed spirits is designated as the *bosom of Abraham*, it is
plain that, on quitting this pilgrimage, they are received by the common
father of the faithful, who imparts to them the fruit of his faith.
Still, since Scripture uniformly enjoins us to look with expectation to
the advent of Christ, and delays the crown of glory till that period,
let us be contented with the limits divinely prescribed to us—viz. that
the souls of the righteous, after their warfare is ended, obtain blessed
rest where in joy they wait for the fruition of promised glory, and that
thus the final result is suspended till Christ the Redeemer appear.
There can be no doubt that the reprobate have the same doom as that
which Jude assigns to the devils, they are “reserved in everlasting
chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day,” (Jude ver.
6).

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30"></span>7. Equally monstrous is the error of
those who imagine that the soul, instead of resuming the body with which
it is now clothed, will obtain a new and different body. Nothing can be
more futile than the reason given by the Manichees—viz. that it were
incongruous for impure flesh to rise again: as if there were no impurity
in the soul; and yet this does not exclude it from the hope of heavenly
life. It is just as if they were to say, that what is infected by the
taint of sin cannot be divinely purified; for I now say nothing to the
delirious dream that flesh is naturally impure as having been created by
the devil. I only maintain, that nothing in us at present, which is
unworthy of heaven, is any obstacle to the resurrection. But, first,
Paul enjoins believers to purify themselves from “all filthiness of the
flesh and spirit,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.1"></span>[2 Cor.
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.1"></span> the judgment which is to follow, that
every one shall “receive the things done in his body, according to that
he has done, whether it be good or bad,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.2"></span>[2 Cor.
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.2"></span>). With this accords what he says to the
Corinthians, “That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our
body,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.3"></span>[2 Cor.
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.3"></span>). For which reason he elsewhere says, “I
pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.4"></span>[1 Thess.
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.4"></span>). He says “body” as well as “spirit and
soul,” and no wonder; for it were most absurd that bodies which God has
dedicated to himself as temples should fall into corruption without hope
of resurrection. What? are they not also the members of Christ? Does he
not pray that God would sanctify every part of them, and enjoin them to
celebrate his name with their tongues, lift up pure hands, and offer
sacrifices? That part of man, therefore, which the heavenly Judge so
highly honors, what madness is it for any mortal man to reduce to dust
without hope of revival? In like manner, when Paul exhorts, “glorify God
in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s,” he certainly does
not allow that that which he claims for God as sacred is to be adjudged
to eternal corruption. Nor, indeed, on any subject does Scripture
furnish clearer explanation than on the resurrection of our flesh. “This
corruptible (says Paul) must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
put on immortality,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.5"></span>[1 Cor.
15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.5"></span>). If God formed new bodies, where would
be this change of quality? If it were said that we must be renewed, the
ambiguity of the expression might, perhaps, afford room for cavil; but
here pointing with the finger to the bodies with which we are clothed,
and promising that they shall be incorruptible, he very plainly affirms
that no new bodies are to be fabricated. “Nay,” as Tertullian says, “he
could not have spoken more expressly, if he had held his skin in his
hands,” (Tertull. de Resurrect. Carnis). Nor can any cavil enable them
to evade the force of another passage, in which saying that Christ will
be the Judge of the world, he quotes from Isaiah, “As I live, saith the
Lord, every knee shall bow to me,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.6"></span>[Rom.
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.6"></span>; <span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.7"></span>[Isa.
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.7"></span>); since he openly declares that those
whom he was addressing will have to give an account of their lives. This
could not be true if new bodies were to be sisted to the tribunal.
Moreover, there is no ambiguity in the words of Daniel, “Many of them
that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting
life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.8"></span>[Dan.
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.8"></span>); since he does not bring new matter from
the four elements to compose men, but calls forth the dead from their
graves. And the reason which dictates this is plain. For if death, which
originated in the fall of man, is adventitious, the renewal produced by
Christ must be in the same body which began to be mortal. And,
certainly, since the Athenians mocked Paul for asserting the
resurrection (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.9"></span>[Acts
17:32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.9"></span>), we may infer what his preaching was:
their derision is of no small force to confirm our faith. The saying of
our Savior also is worthy of observation, “Fear not them which kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is
able to destroy both soul and body in hell,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.10"></span>[Mt.
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.10"></span>). Here there would be no ground for
fear; were not the body which we now have liable to punishment. Nor is
another saying of our Savior less obscure, “The hour is coming, in the
which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come
forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they
that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.11"></span>[John
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.11"></span>). Shall we say that the soul rests in
the grave, that it may there hear the voice of Christ, and not rather
that the body shall at his command resume the vigor which it had lost?
Moreover, if we are to receive new bodies, where will be the conformity
of the Head and the members? Christ rose again. Was it by forming for
himself a new body? Nay, he had foretold, “Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.12"></span>[John
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.12"></span>). The mortal body which he had formerly
carried he again received; for it would not have availed us much if a
new body had been substituted, and that which had been offered in
expiatory sacrifice been destroyed. We must, therefore, attend to that
connection which the Apostle celebrates, that we rise because Christ
rose (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.13"></span>[1 Cor.
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.13"></span>); nothing being less probable than that
the flesh in which we bear about the dying of Christ, shall have no
share in the resurrection of Christ. This was even manifested by a
striking example, when, at the resurrection of Christ, many bodies of
the saints came forth from their graves. For it cannot be denied that
this was a prelude, or rather earnest, of the final resurrection for
which we hope, such as already existed in Enoch and Elijah, whom
Tertullian calls *candidates for resurrection*, because, exempted from
corruption, both in body and soul, they were received into the custody
of God. the judgment which is to follow, that every one shall “receive
the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it
be good or bad,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p30.14"></span>[2 Cor.

Tertullian calls *candidates for resurrection*, because, exempted from

of God.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31"></span>8. I am ashamed to waste so many words
on so clear a matter; but my readers will kindly submit to the
annoyance, in order that perverse and presumptuous minds may not be able
to avail themselves of any flaw to deceive the simple. The volatile
spirits with whom I now dispute adduce the fiction of their own brain,
that in the resurrection there will be a creation of new bodies. Their
only reason for thinking so is, that it seems to them incredible that a
dead body, long wasted by corruption, should return to its former state.
Therefore, mere unbelief is the parent of their opinion. The Spirit of
God, on the contrary, uniformly exhorts us in Scripture to hope for the
resurrection of our flesh. For this reason Baptism is, according to
Paul, a seal of our future resurrection; and in like manner the holy
Supper invites us confidently to expect it, when with our mouths we
receive the symbols of spiritual grace. And certainly the whole
exhortation of Paul, “Yield ye your members as instruments of
righteousness unto God,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.1"></span>[Rom.
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.1"></span>), would be frigid, did he not add, as he
does in another passage, “He that raised up Christ from the dead shall
also quicken your mortal bodies,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.2"></span>[Rom.
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.2"></span>). For what would it avail to apply feet,
hands, eyes, and tongues, to the service of God, did not these
afterwards participate in the benefit and reward? This Paul expressly
confirms when he says, “The body is not for fornication, but for the
Lord; and the Lord for the body. And God has both raised up the Lord,
and will also raise up us by his own power,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.3"></span>[1 Cor.
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.3"></span>). The words which follow are still
clearer, “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?” “Know
ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost?” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.4"></span>[1 Cor.
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#015.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.4"></span>). Meanwhile, we see how he connects the
resurrection with chastity and holiness, as he shortly after includes
our bodies in the purchase of redemption. It would be inconsistent with
reason, that the body, in which Paul bore the marks of his Savior, and
in which he magnificently extolled him (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.5"></span>[Gal.
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.5"></span>), should lose the reward of the crown.
Hence he glories thus, “Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also
we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change our
vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.6"></span>[Phil.
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.6"></span>). As it is true, “That we must through
much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.7"></span>[Acts
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p31.7"></span>); so it were unreasonable that this
entrance should be denied to the bodies which God exercises under the
banner of the cross and adorns with the palm of victory.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p32"></span>Accordingly, the saints never
entertained any doubt that they would one day be the companions of
Christ, who transfers to his own person all the afflictions by which we
are tried, that he may show their quickening power.51  <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) Nay, under the law, God trained the
holy patriarch in this belief, by means of an external ceremony. For to
what end was the rite of burial, as we have already seen, unless to
teach that new life was prepared for the bodies thus deposited? Hence,
also, the spices and other symbols of immortality, by which under the
law the obscurity of the doctrine was illustrated in the same way as by
sacrifices. That custom was not the offspring of superstition, since we
see that the Spirit is not less careful in narrating burials than in
stating the principal mysteries of the faith. Christ commends these last
offices as of no trivial importance (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p33.1"></span>[Mt.
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p33.1"></span>), and that, certainly, for no other
reason than just that they raise our eyes from the view of the tombs
which corrupts and destroys all things, to the prospect of renovation.
Besides, that careful observance of the ceremony for which the
patriarchs are praised, sufficiently proves that they found in it a
special and valuable help to their faith. Nor would Abraham have been so
anxious about the burial of his wife (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p33.2"></span>[Gen.
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#004.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p33.2"></span>), had not the religious views and
something superior to any worldly advantage, been present to his mind;
in other words, by adorning her dead body with the insignia of the
resurrection, he confirmed his own faith, and that of his family. A
clearer proof of this appears in the example of Jacob, who, to testify
to his posterity that even death did not destroy the hope of the
promised land, orders his bones to be carried thither. Had he been to be
clothed with a new body would it not have been ridiculous in him to give
commands concerning a dust which was to be reduced to nothing?
Wherefore, if Scripture has any authority with us, we cannot desire a
clearer or stronger proof of any doctrine. Even tyros understand this to
be the meaning of the words, *resurrection*, and *raising up*. A thing
which is created for the first time cannot be said to rise again; nor
could our Savior have said, “This is the Father’s will which has sent
me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should
raise it up again at the last day,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p33.3"></span>[John
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p33.3"></span>). The same is implied in the word
*sleeping*, which is applicable only to the body. Hence, too, the name
of cemetery, applied to burying-grounds.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34"></span>It remains to make a passing remark on
the mode of resurrection. I speak thus because Paul, by styling it a
mystery, exhorts us to soberness, in order that he may curb a licentious
indulgence in free and subtle speculation. First, we must hold, as has
already been observed, that the body in which we shall rise will be the
same as at present in respect of substance, but that the quality will be
different; just as the body of Christ which was raised up was the same
as that which had been offered in sacrifice, and yet excelled in other
qualities, as if it had been altogether different. This Paul declares by
familiar examples (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.1"></span>[1 Cor.
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#039.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.1"></span>). For as the flesh of man and of beasts
is the same in substance, but not in quality: as all the stars are made
of the same matter, but have different degrees of brightness: so he
shows, that though we shall retain the substance of the body, there will
be a change, by which its condition will become much more excellent. The
corruptible body, therefore, in order that we may be raised, will not
perish or vanish away, but, divested of corruption, will be clothed with
incorruption. Since God has all the elements at his disposal, no
difficulty can prevent him from commanding the earth, the fire, and the
water, to give up what they seem to have destroyed. This, also, though
not without figure, Isaiah testifies, “Behold, the Lore comes out of his
place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the
earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.2"></span>[Isa.
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.2"></span>). But a distinction must be made between
those who died long ago, and those who on that day shall be found alive.
For as Paul declares, “We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.3"></span>[1 Cor.
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.3"></span>); that is, it will not be necessary that
a period should elapse between death and the beginning of the second
life, for in a moment of time, in the twinkling of an eye, the trumpet
shall sound, raising up the dead incorruptible, and, by a sudden change,
fitting those who are alive for the same glory. So, in another passage,
he comforts believers who were to undergo death, telling them that those
who are then alive shall not take precedence of the dead, because those
who have fallen asleep in Christ shall rise first (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.4"></span>[1 Thess.
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.4"></span>). Should any one urge the Apostle’s
declaration, “It is appointed unto all men once to die,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.5"></span>[Heb.
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p34.5"></span>), the solution is easy, that when the
natural state is changed there is an appearance of death, which is fitly
so denominated, and, therefore, there is no inconsistency in the two
things—viz. that all when divested of their mortal body shall be renewed
by death; and yet that where the change is sudden, there will be no
necessary separation between the soul and the body.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p35"></span>9. But a more difficult question here
arises, How can the resurrection, which is a special benefit of Christ,
be common to the ungodly, who are lying under the curse of God? We know
that in Adam all died. Christ has come to be the resurrection and the
life (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p35.1"></span>[John
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p35.1"></span>). is it to revive the whole human race
indiscriminately? But what more incongruous than that the ungodly in
their obstinate blindness should obtain what the pious worshipers of God
receive by faith only? It is certain, therefore, that there will be one
resurrection to judgment, and another to life, and that Christ will come
to separate the kids from the goats (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p35.2"></span>[Mt.
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p35.2"></span>). I observe, that this ought not to seem
very strange, seeing something resembling it occurs every day. We know
that in Adam we were deprived of the inheritance of the whole world, and
that the same reason which excludes us from eating of the tree of life
excludes us also from common food. How comes it, then, that God not only
makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, but that, in regard
to the uses of the present life, his inestimable liberality is
constantly flowing forth in rich abundance? Hence we certainly perceive,
that things which are proper to Christ and his members, abound to the
wicked also; not that their possession is legitimate, but that they may
thus be rendered more inexcusable. Thus the wicked often experience the
beneficence of God, not in ordinary measures, but such as sometimes
throw all the blessings of the godly into the shade, though they
eventually lead to greater damnation. Should it be objected, that the
resurrection is not properly compared to fading and earthly blessings, I
again answer, that when the devils were first alienated from God, the
fountain of life, they deserved to be utterly destroyed; yet, by the
admirable counsel of God, an intermediate state was prepared, where
without life they might live in death. It ought not to seem in any
respect more absurd that there is to be an adventitious resurrection of
the ungodly which will drag them against their will before the tribunal
of Christ, whom they now refuse to receive as their master and teacher.
To be consumed by death would be a light punishment were they not, in
order to the punishment of their rebellion, to be sisted before the
Judge whom they have provoked to a vengeance without measure and without
end. But although we are to hold, as already observed and as is
contained in the celebrated confession of Paul to Felix, “That there
shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p35.3"></span>[Acts
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p35.3"></span>); yet Scripture more frequently sets
forth the resurrection as intended, along with celestial glory, for the
children of God only: because, properly speaking, Christ comes not for
the destruction, but for the salvation of the world: and, therefore, in
the Creed the life of blessedness only is mentioned.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36"></span>10. But since the prophecy that death
shall be swallowed up in victory (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.1"></span>[Hosea
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.1"></span>), will then only be completed, let us
always remember that the end of the resurrection is eternal happiness,
of whose excellence scarcely the minutes part can be described by all
that human tongues can say. For though we are truly told that the
kingdom of God will be full of light, and gladness, and felicity, and
glory, yet the things meant by these words remain most remote from
sense, and as it were involved in enigma, until the day arrive on which
he will manifest his glory to us face to face (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.2"></span>[1 Cor.
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.2"></span>). “Now” says John, “are we the sons of
God; and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.3"></span>[1 John
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.3"></span>). Hence, as the prophets were unable to
give a verbal description of that spiritual blessedness, they usually
delineated it by corporeal objects. On the other hand, because the
fervor of desire must be kindled in us by some taste of its sweetness,
let us specially dwell upon this thought, If God contains in himself as
an inexhaustible fountain all fulness of blessing, those who aspire to
the supreme good and perfect happiness must not long for any thing
beyond him. This we are taught in several passages, “Fear not, Abraham;
I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.4"></span>[Gen.
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.4"></span>). With this accords David’s sentiment,
“The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou
maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.5"></span>[Ps.
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.5"></span>). Again, “I shall be satisfied when I
awake with thy likeness,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.6"></span>[Ps.
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.6"></span>). Peter declares that the purpose for
which believers are called is, that they may be “partakers of the divine
nature,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.7"></span>[2 Pet.
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.7"></span>). How so? Because “he shall come to be
glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.8"></span>[2 Thess.
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p36.8"></span>). If our Lord will share his glory,
power, and righteousness, with the elect, nay, will give himself to be
enjoyed by them; and what is better still, will, in a manner, become one
with them, let us remember that every kind of happiness is herein
included. But when we have made great progress in thus meditating, let
us understand that if the conceptions of our minds be contrasted with
the sublimity of the mystery, we are still halting at the very
entrance.51  <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) The more necessary
is it for us to cultivate sobriety in this matter, lest unmindful of our
feeble capacity we presume to take too lofty a flight, and be
overwhelmed by the brightness of the celestial glory. We feel how much
we are stimulated by an excessive desire of knowing more than is given
us to know, and hence frivolous and noxious questions are ever and anon
springing forth: by frivolous, I mean questions from which no advantage
can be extracted. But there is a second class which is worse than
frivolous; because those who indulge in them involve themselves in
hurtful speculations. Hence I call them noxious. The doctrine of
Scripture on the subject ought not to be made the ground of any
controversy, and it is that as God, in the varied distribution of gifts
to his saints in this world, gives them unequal degrees of light, so
when he shall crown his gifts, their degrees of glory in heaven will
also be unequal. When Paul says, “Ye are our glory and our joy,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.1"></span>[1 Thess.
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.1"></span>), his words do not apply indiscriminately
to all; nor do those of our Savior to his apostles, “Ye also shall sit
on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.2"></span>[Mt.
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.2"></span>). But Paul, who knew that as God enriches
the saints with spiritual gifts in this world, he will in like manner
adorn them with glory in heaven, hesitates not to say, that a special
crown is laid up for him in proportion to his labors. Our Savior, also,
to commend the dignity of the office which he had conferred on the
apostles, reminds them that the fruit of it is laid up in heaven. This,
too, Daniel says, “They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for
ever and ever,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.3"></span>[Dan.
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.3"></span>). Any one who attentively considers the
Scriptures will see net only that they promise eternal life to
believers, but a special reward to each. Hence the expression of Paul,
“The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that
day,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.4"></span>[2 Tim.
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.4"></span>; 4:14). This is confirmed by our Savior’s
promise, that they “shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit
everlasting life,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.5"></span>[Mt.
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p37.5"></span>). In short, as Christ, by the manifold
variety of his gifts, begins the glory of his body in this world, and
gradually increases it, so he will complete it in heaven.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p38"></span>11. While all the godly with one
consent will admit this, because it is sufficiently attested by the word
of God, they will, on the other hand, avoid perplexing questions which
they feel to be a hindrance in their way, and thus keep within the
prescribed limits. In regard to myself, I not only individually refrain
from a superfluous investigation of useless matters, but also think
myself bound to take care that I do not encourage the levity of others
by answering them. Men puffed up with vain science are often inquiring
how great the difference will be between prophets and apostles, and
again, between apostles and martyrs; by how many degrees virgins will
surpass those who are married; in short, they leave not a corner of
heaven untouched by their speculations. Next it occurs to them to
inquire to what end the world is to be repaired, since the children of
God will not be in want of any part of this great and incomparable
abundance, but will be like the angels, whose abstinence from food is a
symbol of eternal blessedness. I answer, that independent of use, there
will be so much pleasantness in the very sight, so much delight in the
very knowledge, that this happiness will far surpass all the means of
enjoyment which are now afforded. Let us suppose ourselves placed in the
richest quarter of the globe, where no kind of pleasure is wanting, who
is there that is not ever and anon hindered and excluded by disease from
enjoying the gifts of God? who does not oftentimes interrupt the course
of enjoyment by intemperance? Hence it follows, that fruition, pure and
free from all defect, though it be of no use to a corruptible life, is
the summit of happiness. Others go further, and ask whether dross and
other impurities in metals will have no existence at the restitution,
and are inconsistent with it. Though I should go so far as concede this
to them, yet I expect with Paul a reparation of those defects which
first began with sin, and on account of which the whole creation
groaneth and travaileth with pain (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p38.1"></span>[Rom.
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p38.1"></span>). Others go a step further, and ask, What
better condition can await the human race, since the blessing of
offspring shall then have an end? The solution of this difficulty also
is easy. When Scripture so highly extols the blessing of offspring, it
refers to the progress by which God is constantly urging nature forward
to its goal; in perfection itself we know that the case is different.
But as such alluring speculations instantly captivate the unwary, who
are afterwards led farther into the labyrinth, until at length, every
one becoming pleased with his own views there is no limit to
disputation, the best and shortest course for us will be to rest
contented with seeing through a glass darkly until we shall see face to
face. Few out of the vast multitude of mankind feel concerned how they
are to get to heaven; all would fain know before the time what is done
in heaven. Almost all, while slow and sluggish in entering upon the
contest, are already depicting to themselves imaginary triumphs.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39"></span>12. Moreover, as language cannot
describe the severity of the divine vengeance on the reprobate, their
pains and torments are figured to us by corporeal things, such as
darkness, wailing and gnashing of teeth, inextinguishable fire, the
ever-gnawing worm (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.1"></span>[Mt.
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.1"></span>; 22:13; <span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.2"></span>[Mark
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.2"></span>; <span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.3"></span>[Isa.
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.3"></span>). It is certain that by such modes of
expression the Holy Spirit designed to impress all our senses with
dread, as when it is said, “Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king
it is prepared: he has made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire
and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, does
kindle it,” (<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.4"></span>[Isa.
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.4"></span>). As we thus require to be assisted to
conceive the miserable doom of the reprobate, so the consideration on
which we ought chiefly to dwell is the fearful consequence of being
estranged from all fellowship with God, and not only so, but of feeling
that his majesty is adverse to us, while we cannot possibly escape from
it. For, first, his indignation is like a raging fire, by whose touch
all things are devoured and annihilated. Next, all the creatures are the
instruments of his judgment, so that those to whom the Lord will thus
publicly manifest his anger will feel that heaven, and earth, and sea,
all beings, animate and inanimate, are, as it were, inflamed with dire
indignation against them, and armed for their destruction. Wherefore,
the Apostle made no trivial declaration, when he said that unbelievers
shall be “punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the
Lord, and from the glory of his power,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.5"></span>[2 Thess.
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p39.5"></span>). And whenever the prophets strike terror
by means of corporeal figures, although in respect of our dull
understanding there is no extravagance in their language, yet they give
preludes of the future judgment in the sun and the moon, and the whole
fabric of the world. Hence unhappy consciences find no rest, but are
vexed and driven about by a dire whirlwind, feeling as if torn by an
angry God, pierced through with deadly darts, terrified by his
thunderbolts and crushed by the weight of his hand; so that it were
easier to plunge into abysses and whirlpools than endure these terrors
for a moment. How fearful, then, must it be to be thus beset throughout
eternity! On this subject there is a memorable passage in the ninetieth
Psalm: Although God by a mere look scatters all mortals, and brings them
to nought, yet as his worshippers are more timid in this world, he urges
them the more, that he may stimulate then, while burdened with the cross
to press onward until he himself shall be all in all.

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p26"></span>101 D101 Chiliasm (from a Greek word
meaning “a thousand”) arose very early in the history of theology. Some
of the early Church Fathers distinguished between a first and a second
resurrection, and held that there would be an intervening millennial
kingdom in which Christ would reign with His saints upon the earth. This
view may be found in Papias, Irenaeus, Barnabas, Hermas, Justin Martyr,
and Tertullian (all from the second century). But by the time of Luther
and Calvin, the leading theologians (both Roman Catholic and Protestant)
had rejected the doctrine of an earthly millennium. Calvin calls it a
“fiction,” and says that it is “too puerile to need or to deserve
refutation.”

<span id="fn_508"></span>[509](inst078.htm#fr_508.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p26.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxvi-p27"></span>102 D102 Calvin’s chief objection to
“Chiliasm” appears to be alleged limitation, to a period of one thousand
years, of the reign of Christ with His saints. A secondary objection
arises out of his interpretation of <span

20:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxvi-p27.1"></span> (in which the term “thousand years”
appears six times) as referring to the Church militant in this world.
These objections against “Chiliasm” would today apply only to that view
of the last things called Premillennialism. However, if a person held
(1) that Christ’s kingdom is spiritually present, as He rules in the
hearts of His elect; (2) that Christ’s kingdom shall have a future,
earthly manifestation, when He shall reign with His saints upon the
earth; and (3) that Christ’s kingdom will not cease at the close of the
thousand years, but will merge into eternity; then it would appear that
Calvin’s chief objection to this view would be removed. Of course, his
secondary objection would remain as a difference of hermeneutical
(interpretive) approach and method.
