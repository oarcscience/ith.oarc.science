## <span id="ii.iii-p0.1"></span>THE PRINTERS TO THE READERS.

<span id="ii.iii-p1"></span>Whereas some men have thought and reported
it to be \[very great negligence in us for that we have so long kept
back from you this,\] being so profitable a work for you, namely before
the master J\[ohnne\] Dawes had translated it and delivered it into our
hands more than a twelvemonth past: you shall understand for our excuse
in that behalf, that we could not well imprint it sooner. For we have
been by diverse necessary causes constrained with our earnest
entreatance to procure an other frede or oures to translate it whole
again. This translation, we trust, you shall well allow. For it hath not
only been faithfully done by the translator himself, but also hath been
wholly perused by such men, whose ingement and credit all the godly
learned in England well know I estheme. But since it is now come forth,
we pray you accept it, and see it. If any faults have passed us by
oversight, we beseech you let us have your patience, as you have had our
diligence.

<span id="ii.iii-p2"></span>The Institution of Christian Religion,

principal matters entreated of in this book, and also the declaration of
places of Scripture therein expounded, by Thomas Norton. Whereunto there
are newly added in the margen of the book, notes containing in briefs
the substance of the matter handled in each Section.
