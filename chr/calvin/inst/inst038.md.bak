### <span id="iv.ii.v-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 4.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p1"></span>HOW GOD WORKS IN THE HEARTS OF MEN.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p2"></span>The leading points discussed in this
chapter are, I. Whether in bad actions anything is to be attributed to
God; if anything, how much. Also, what is to be attributed to the devil
and to man, sec. 1–5. II. In indifferent matters, how much is to be
attributed to God, and how much is left to man, sec. 6. III. Two
objections refuted, sec. 7, 8.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p3"></span>*Sections.*

<span id="iv.ii.v-p4"></span>1. Connection of this chapter with the
preceding. Augustine’s similitude of a good and bad rider. Question
answered in respect to the devil.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p5"></span>2. Question answered in respect to God and
man. Example from the history of Job. The works of God distinguished
from the works of Satan and wicked men. 1. By the design or end of
acting. How Satan acts in the reprobate. 2. How God acts in them.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p6"></span>3. Old Objection, that the agency of God in
such cases is referable to prescience or permission, not actual
operation. Answer, showing that God blinds and hardens the reprobate,
and this in two ways; 1. By deserting them; 2. By delivering them over
to Satan.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p7"></span>4. Striking passages of Scripture, proving
that God acts in both ways, and disposing of the objection with regard
to prescience. Confirmation from Augustine.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p8"></span>5. A modification of the former answer,
proving that God employs Satan to instigate the reprobate, but, at the
same time, is free from all taint.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p9"></span>6. How God works in the hearts of men in
indifferent matters. Our will in such matters not so free as to be
exempt from the overruling providence of God. This confirmed by various
examples.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p10"></span>7. Objection, that these examples do not
form the rule. An answer, fortified by the testimony of universal
experience, by Scripture, and a passage of Augustine.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p11"></span>8. Some, in arguing against the error of
free will, draw an argument from the event. How this is to be
understood.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p12"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.v-p13"></span>1. That man is so enslaved by the yoke of
sin, that he cannot of his own nature aim at good either in wish or
actual pursuit, has, I think, been sufficiently proved. Moreover, a
distinction has been drawn between compulsion and necessity, making it
clear that man, though he sins necessarily, nevertheless sins
voluntarily. But since, from his being brought into bondage to the
devil, it would seem that he is actuated more by the devil’s will than
his own, it is necessary, first, to explain what the agency of each is,
and then solve the question,17  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md)
Whether in bad actions anything is to be attributed to God, Scripture
intimating that there is some way in which he interferes? Augustine (in
<span id="iv.ii.v-p14.1"></span>[Psalm
31](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.ii.v-p14.1"></span> and
33) compares the human will to a horse preparing to start, and God and
the devil to riders. “If God mounts, he, like a temperate and skilful
rider, guides it calmly, urges it when too slow, reins it in when too
fast, curbs its forwardness and over-action, checks its bad temper, and
keeps it on the proper course; but if the devil has seized the saddle,
like an ignorant and rash rider, he hurries it over broken ground,
drives it into ditches, dashes it over precipices, spurs it into
obstinacy or fury.” With this simile, since a better does not occur, we
shall for the present be contented. When it is said, then, that the will
of the natural man is subject to the power of the devil, and is actuated
by him, the meaning is not that the wills while reluctant and resisting,
is forced to submit (as masters oblige unwilling slaves to execute their
orders), but that, fascinated by the impostures of Satan, it necessarily
yields to his guidance, and does him homage. Those whom the Lord favours
not with the direction of his Spirit, he, by a righteous judgment,
consigns to the agency of Satan. Wherefore, the Apostle says, that “the
god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest
the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,
should shine into them.” And, in another passage, he describes the devil
as “the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,” (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p14.2"></span>[Eph.
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)<span id="iv.ii.v-p14.2"></span>.md).
The blinding of the wicked, and all the iniquities consequent upon it,
are called the works of Satan; works the cause of which is not to be
Sought in anything external to the will of man, in which the root of the
evil lies, and in which the foundation of Satan’s kingdom, in other
words, sin, is fixed.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p15"></span>2. The nature of the divine agency in such
cases is very different. For the purpose of illustration, let us refer
to the calamities brought upon holy Job by the Chaldeans. They having
slain his shepherds, carry off his flocks. The wickedness of their deed
is manifest,17  <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) as is also the
hand of Satan, who, as the history informs us, was the instigator of the
whole. Job, however, recognises it as the work of God, saying, that what
the Chaldeans had plundered, “the Lord” had “taken away.” How can we
attribute the same work to God, to Satan, and to man, without either
excusing Satan by the interference of God, or making God the author of
the crime? This is easily done, if we look first to the end, and then to
the mode of acting. The Lord designs to exercise the patience of his
servant by adversity; Satan’s plan is to drive him to despair; while the
Chaldeans are bent on making unlawful gain by plunder. Such diversity of
purpose makes a wide distinction in the act. In the mode there is not
less difference. The Lord permits Satan to afflict his servant; and the
Chaldeans, who had been chosen as the ministers to execute the deed, he
hands over to the impulses of Satan, who, pricking on the already
depraved Chaldeans with his poisoned darts, instigates them to commit
the crime. They rush furiously on to the unrighteous deed, and become
its guilty perpetrators. Here Satan is properly said to act in the
reprobate, over whom he exercises his sway, which is that of wickedness.
God also is said to act in his own way; because even Satan when he is
the instrument of divine wrath, is completely under the command of God,
who turns him as he will in the execution of his just judgments. I say
nothing here of the universal agency of God, which, as it sustains all
the creatures, also gives them all their power of acting. I am now
speaking only of that special agency which is apparent in every act. We
thus see that there is no inconsistency in attributing the same act to
God, to Satan, and to man, while, from the difference in the end and
mode of action, the spotless righteousness of God shines forth at the
same time that the iniquity of Satan and of man is manifested in all its
deformity.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p17"></span>3. Ancient writers sometimes manifest a
superstitious dread of making a simple confession of the truth in this
matter, from a fear of furnishing impiety with a handle for speaking
irreverently of the works of God. While I embrace such soberness with
all my heart, I cannot see the least danger in simply holding what
Scripture delivers. when Augustine was not always free from this
superstition, as when he says, that blinding and hardening have respect
not to the operation of God, but to prescience (Lib. de Predestina. et
Gratia). But this subtilty is repudiated by many passages of Scriptures
which clearly show that the divine interference amounts to something
more than prescience. And Augustine himself, in his book against
Julian,17  <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) contends at length
that sins are manifestations not merely of divine permission or
patience, but also of divine power, that thus former sins may be
punished. In like manner, what is said of permission is too weak to
stand. God is very often said to blind and harden the reprobate, to turn
their hearts, to incline and impel them, as I have elsewhere fully
explained (Book 1 c. 18). The extent of this agency can never be
explained by having recourse to prescience or permission. We, therefore,
hold that there are two methods in which God may so act. When his light
is taken away, nothing remains but blindness and darkness: when his
Spirit is taken away, our hearts become hard as stones: when his
guidance is withdrawn, we immediately turn from the right path: and
hence he is properly said to incline, harden, and blind those whom he
deprives of the faculty of seeing, obeying, and rightly executing. The
second method, which comes much nearer to the exact meaning of the
words, is when executing his judgments by Satan as the minister of his
anger, God both directs men’s counsels, and excites their wills, and
regulates their efforts as he pleases. Thus when Moses relates that
Simon, king of the Amorites, did not give the Israelites a passage,
because the Lord “had hardened his spirit, and made his heart
obstinate,” he immediately adds the purpose which God had in view—viz.
that he might deliver him into their hand (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p18.1"></span>[Deut.
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030)<span id="iv.ii.v-p18.1"></span>.md).
As God had resolved to destroy him, the hardening of his heart was the
divine preparation for his ruin.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p19"></span>4. In accordance with the former methods
it seems to be said,17  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) “The law
shall perish from the priests and counsel from the ancients.” “He
poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the
wilderness, where there is no way.” Again “O Lord, why hast thou made us
to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear?” These
passages rather indicate what men become when God deserts them, than
what the nature of his agency is when he works in them. But there are
other passages which go farther, such as those concerning the hardening
of Pharaoh: “I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people
go.” The same thing is afterwards repeated in stronger terms. Did he
harden his heart by not softening it? This is, indeed, true; but he did
something more: he gave it in charge to Satan to confirm him in his
obstinacy. Hence he had previously said, “I am sure he will not let you
go.” The people come out of Egypt, and the inhabitants of a hostile
region come forth against them. How were they instigated? Moses
certainly declares of Sihon, that it was the Lord who “had hardened his
spirit, and made his heart obstinate,” (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p20.5"></span>[Deut.
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#030)<span id="iv.ii.v-p20.5"></span>.md).
The Psalmists relating the same history says, “He turned their hearts to
hate his people,” (<span id="iv.ii.v-p20.6"></span>[Psalm
105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.ii.v-p20.6"></span>). You cannot now say that they stumbled
merely because they were deprived of divine counsel. For if they are
*hardened* and *turned*, they are purposely bent to the very end in
view. Moreover, whenever God saw it meet to punish the people for their
transgression, in what way did he accomplish his purpose by the
reprobate? In such a way as shows that the efficacy of the action was in
him, and that they were only ministers. At one time he declares, “that
he will lift an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them
from the end of the earth;” at another, that he will take a net to
ensnare them; and at another, that he will be like a hammer to strike
them. But he specially declared that he was not inactive among theme
when he called Sennacherib an axe, which was formed and destined to be
wielded by his own hand.17  <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md)
Augustine is not far from the mark when he states the matter thus, That
men sin, is attributable to themselves: that in sinning they produce
this or that result, is owing to the mighty power of God, who divides
the darkness as he pleases (August. de Prædest. Sanct).

<span id="iv.ii.v-p22"></span>5. Moreover, that the ministry of Satan is
employed to instigate the reprobate, whenever the Lord, in the course of
his providence, has any purpose to accomplish in them, will sufficiently
appear from a single passage. It is repeatedly said in the First Book of
Samuel, that an evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul, and troubled
him (<span id="iv.ii.v-p22.1"></span>[1 Sam.
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.ii.v-p22.1"></span>;
18:10; 19:9). It were impious to apply this to the Holy Spirit. An
impure spirit must therefore be called a spirit from the Lord, because
completely subservient to his purpose, being more an instrument in
acting than a proper agent. We should also add what Paul says, “God
shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that
they all might be damned who believed not the truth,” (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p22.2"></span>[2 Thess.
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012)<span id="iv.ii.v-p22.2"></span>.md).
But in the same transaction there is always a wide difference between
what the Lord does, and what Satan and the ungodly design to do. The
wicked instruments which he has under his hand and can turn as he
pleases, he makes subservient to his own justice. They, as they are
wicked, give effect to the iniquity conceived in their wicked minds.
Every thing necessary to vindicate the majesty of God from calumny, and
cut off any subterfuge on the part of the ungodly, has already been
expounded in the Chapters on Providence (Book 1 Chapter 16–18). Here I
only meant to show, in a few words, how Satan reigns in the reprobate,
and how God works in both.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p23"></span>6. In those actions, which in themselves
are neither good nor bad, and concern the corporeal rather than the
spiritual life, the liberty which man possesses, although we have above
touched upon it (*supra*, Chap. 2 sect. 13–17), has not yet been
explained. Some have conceded a free choice to man in such actions;
more, I suppose, because they were unwilling to debate a matter of no
great moment, than because they wished positively to assert what they
were prepared to concede. While I admit that those who hold that man has
no ability in himself to do righteousness, hold what is most necessary
to be known for salvation, I think it ought not to be overlooked that we
owe it to the special grace of God, whenever, on the one hand, we choose
what is for our advantage, and whenever our will inclines in that
direction; and on the other, whenever with heart and soul we shun what
would otherwise do us harm. And the interference of Divine Providence
goes to the extent not only of making events turn out as was foreseen to
be expedient, but of giving the wills of men the same direction. If we
look at the administration of human affairs with the eye of sense, we
will have no doubt that, so far, they are placed at man’s disposal; but
if we lend an ear to the many passages of Scripture which proclaim that
even in these matters the minds of men are ruled by God, they will
compel us to place human choice in subordination to his special
influence. Who gave the Israelites such favour in the eyes of the
Egyptians, that they lent them all their most valuable commodities?
(<span id="iv.ii.v-p23.1"></span>[Exod.
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#003)<span id="iv.ii.v-p23.1"></span>.md).
They never would have been so inclined of their own accord. Their
inclinations, therefore, were more overruled by God than regulated by
themselves. And surely, had not Jacob been persuaded that God inspires
men with divers affections as seemeth to him good, he would not have
said of his son Joseph (whom he thought to be some heathen Egyptian),
“God Almighty give you mercy before the man,” (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.2"></span>[Gen.
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.2"></span>). In like manner, the whole Church confesses
that when the Lord was pleased to pity his people, he made them also to
be pitied of all them that carried them captives (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.3"></span>[Ps.
106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046.md)<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.3"></span>). In like manner, when his anger was kindled
against Saul, so that he prepared himself for battle, the cause is
stated to have been, that a spirit from God fell upon him (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.4"></span>[1 Sam.
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#006)<span id="iv.ii.v-p23.4"></span>.md).
who dissuaded Absalom from adopting the counsel of Ahithophel, which was
wont to be regarded as an oracle? (<span id="iv.ii.v-p23.5"></span>[2
Sam. 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.5"></span>). Who disposed Rehoboam to adopt the counsel
of the young men? (<span id="iv.ii.v-p23.6"></span>[1 Kings
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.6"></span>). Who caused the approach of the Israelites
to strike terror into nations formerly distinguished for valour? Even
the harlot Rahab recognised the hand of the Lord. Who, on the other
hand, filled the hearts of the Israelites with fear and dread (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.7"></span>[Lev.
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036.md)<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.7"></span>), but He who threatened in the Law that he
would give them a nn “trembling heart”? (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.8"></span>[Deut.
28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065.md)<span
id="iv.ii.v-p23.8"></span>).

<span id="iv.ii.v-p24"></span>7. It may be objected, that these are
special examples which cannot be regarded as a general rule. They are
sufficient, at all events, to prove the point for which I contend—viz.
that whenever God is pleased to make way for his providence, he even in
external matters so turns and bends the wills of men, that whatever the
freedom of their choice may be, it is still subject to the disposal of
God. That your mind depends more on the agency of God than the freedom
of your own choice, daily experience teaches. Your judgment often fails,
and in matters of no great difficulty, your courage flags; at other
times, in matters of the greatest obscurity, the mode of explicating
them at once suggests itself, while in matters of moment and danger,
your mind rises superior to every difficulty.17  <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) In this way, I interpret the words of
Solomon, “The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even
both of them,” (<span id="iv.ii.v-p25.1"></span>[Prov.
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.ii.v-p25.1"></span>). For they seem to me to refer not to their
creation, but to peculiar grace in the use of them, when he says, “The
king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of water; he
turneth it whithersoever he will,” (<span
id="iv.ii.v-p25.2"></span>[Prov.
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001)<span id="iv.ii.v-p25.2"></span>.md),
he comprehends the whole race under one particular class. If any will is
free from subjection, it must be that of one possessed of regal power,
and in a manner exercising dominion over other wills. But if it is under
the hand of God, ours surely cannot be exempt from it. On this subject
there is an admirable sentiment of Augustine, “Scripture, if it be
carefully examined, will show not only that the good wills of men are
made good by God out of evil, and when so made, are directed to good
acts, even to eternal life, but those which retain the elements of the
world are in the power of God, to turn them whither he pleases, and when
he pleases, either to perform acts of kindness, or by a hidden, indeed,
but, at the same time, most just judgment to inflict punishment,”
(August. De Gratia et Lib. Arb. ad Valent. cap. 20).

<span id="iv.ii.v-p26"></span>8. Let the reader here remember, that the
power of the human will is not to be estimated by the event, as some
unskilful persons are absurdly wont to do. They think it an elegant and
ingenious proof of the bondage of the human will, that even the greatest
monarchs are sometimes thwarted in their wishes. But the ability of
which we speak must be considered as within the man, not measured by
outward success. In discussing the subject of free will, the question is
not, whether external obstacles will permit a man to execute what he has
internally resolved, but whether, in any matter whatever, he has a free
power of judging and of willing. If men possess both of these, Attilius
Regulus, shut up in a barrel studded with sharp nails, will have a will
no less free than Augustus Caesar ruling with imperial sway over a large
portion of the globe.17  <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md)
