### <span id="iv.i.vii-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 6.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p1"></span>THE NEED OF SCRIPTURE, AS A GUIDE AND
TEACHER, IN COMING TO GOD AS A CREATOR.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p2"></span>*Sections.*

<span id="iv.i.vii-p3"></span>1. God gives his elect a better help to
the knowledge of himself—viz. the Holy Scriptures. This he did from the
very first.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p4"></span>2. First, By oracles and visions, and the
ministry of the Patriarchs. Secondly, By the promulgation of the Law,
and the preaching of the Prophets. Why the doctrines of religion are
committed to writing.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p5"></span>3. This view confirmed, 1. By the
depravity of our nature making it necessary in every one who would know
God to have recourse to the word; 2. From those passages of the Psalms
in which God is introduced as reigning.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p6"></span>4. Another confirmation from certain
direct statements in the Psalms. Lastly, From the words of our Saviour.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p7"></span>1. Therefore, though the effulgence which
is presented to every eye, both in the heavens and on the earth, leaves
the ingratitude of man without excuse, since God, in order to bring the
whole human race under the same condemnation, holds forth to all,
without exception, a mirror of his Deity in his works, another and
better help must be given to guide us properly to God as a Creator. Not
in vain, therefore, has he added the light of his Word in order that he
might make himself known unto salvation, and bestowed the privilege on
those whom he was pleased to bring into nearer and more familiar
relation to himself. For, seeing how the minds of men were carried to
and fro, and found no certain resting-place, he chose the Jews for a
peculiar people, and then hedged them in that they might not, like
others, go astray. And not in vain does he, by the same means, retain us
in his knowledge, since but for this, even those who, in comparison of
others, seem to stand strong, would quickly fall away. For as the aged,
or those whose sight is defective, when any books however fair, is set
before them, though they perceive that there is something written are
scarcely able to make out two consecutive words, but, when aided by
glasses, begin to read distinctly, so Scripture, gathering together the
impressions of Deity, which, till then, lay confused in our minds,
dissipates the darkness, and shows us the true God clearly. God
therefore bestows a gift of singular value, when, for the instruction of
the Church, he employs not dumb teachers merely, but opens his own
sacred mouth; when he not only proclaims that some God must be
worshipped, but at the same time declares that He is the God to whom
worship is due; when he not only teaches his elect to have respect to
God, but manifests himself as the God to whom this respect should be
paid.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p8"></span>The course which God followed towards his
Church from the very first, was to supplement these common proofs by the
addition of his Word, as a surer and more direct means of discovering
himself. And there can be no doubt that it was by this help, Adam, Noah,
Abraham, and the other patriarchs, attained to that familiar knowledge
which, in a manner, distinguished them from unbelievers. I am not now
speaking of the peculiar doctrines of faith by which they were elevated
to the hope of eternal blessedness. It was necessary, in passing from
death unto life, that they should know God, not only as a Creator, but
as a Redeemer also; and both kinds of knowledge they certainly did
obtain from the Word. In point of order, however, the knowledge first
given was that which made them acquainted with the God by whom the world
was made and is governed. To this first knowledge was afterwards added
the more intimate knowledge which alone quickens dead souls, and by
which God is known not only as the Creator of the worlds and the sole
author and disposer of all events, but also as a Redeemer, in the person
of the Mediator. But as the fall and the corruption of nature have not
yet been considered, I now postpone the consideration of the remedy (for
which, see Book 2 c. 6 &c). Let the reader then remember, that I am not
now treating of the covenant by which God adopted the children of
Abraham, or of that branch of doctrine by which, as founded in Christ,
believers have, properly speaking, been in all ages separated from the
profane heathen. I am only showing that it is necessary to apply to
Scripture, in order to learn the sure marks which distinguish God, as
the Creator of the world, from the whole herd of fictitious gods. We
shall afterward, in due course, consider the work of Redemption. In the
meantime, though we shall adduce many passages from the New Testament,
and some also from the Law and the Prophets, in which express mention is
made of Christ, the only object will be to show that God, the Maker of
the world, is manifested to us in Scripture, and his true character
expounded, so as to save us from wandering up and down, as in a
labyrinth, in search of some doubtful deity.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p9"></span>2. Whether God revealed himself to the
fathers by oracles and visions,7  <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md)
or, by the instrumentality and ministry of men, suggested what they were
to hand down to posterity, there cannot be a doubt that the certainty of
what he taught them was firmly engraven on their hearts, so that they
felt assured and knew that the things which they learnt came forth from
God, who invariably accompanied his word with a sure testimony,
infinitely superior to mere opinion. At length, in order that, while
doctrine was continually enlarged, its truth might subsist in the world
during all ages, it was his pleasure that the same oracles which he had
deposited with the fathers should be consigned, as it were, to public
records. With this view the law was promulgated, and prophets were
afterwards added to be its interpreters. For though the uses of the law
were manifold (Book 2 c. 7 and 8), and the special office assigned to
Moses and all the prophets was to teach the method of reconciliation
between God and man (whence Paul calls Christ “the end of the law,”
<span id="iv.i.vii-p10.1"></span>[Rom.
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.i.vii-p10.1"></span>); still I repeat that, in addition to the
proper doctrine of faith and repentance in which Christ is set forth as
a Mediator, the Scriptures employ certain marks and tokens to
distinguish the only wise and true God, considered as the Creator and
Governor of the world, and thereby guard against his being confounded
with the herd of false deities. Therefore, while it becomes man
seriously to employ his eyes in considering the works of God, since a
place has been assigned him in this most glorious theatre that he may be
a spectator of them, his special duty is to give ear to the Word, that
he may the better profit.7  <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) Hence
it is not strange that those who are born in darkness become more and
more hardened in their stupidity; because the vast majority instead of
confining themselves within due bounds by listening with docility to the
Word, exult in their own vanity. If true religion is to beam upon us,
our principle must be, that it is necessary to begin with heavenly
teaching, and that it is impossible for any man to obtain even the
minutest portion of right and sound doctrine without being a disciple of
Scripture. Hence, the first step in true knowledge is taken, when we
reverently embrace the testimony which God has been pleased therein to
give of himself. For not only does faith, full and perfect faith, but
all correct knowledge of God, originate in obedience. And surely in this
respect God has with singular Providence provided for mankind in all
ages.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p12"></span>3. For if we reflect how prone the human
mind is to lapse into forgetfulness of God, how readily inclined to
every kind of error, how bent every now and then on devising new and
fictitious religions, it will be easy to understand how necessary it was
to make such a depository of doctrine as would secure it from either
perishing by the neglect, vanishing away amid the errors, or being
corrupted by the presumptuous audacity of men. It being thus manifest
that God, foreseeing the inefficiency of his image imprinted on the fair
form of the universe, has given the assistance of his Word to all whom
he has ever been pleased to instruct effectually, we, too, must pursue
this straight path, if we aspire in earnest to a genuine contemplation
of God;—we must go, I say, to the Word, where the character of God,
drawn from his works is described accurately and to the life; these
works being estimated, not by our depraved Judgment, but by the standard
of eternal truth. If, as I lately said, we turn aside from it, how great
soever the speed with which we move, we shall never reach the goal,
because we are off the course. We should consider that the brightness of
the Divine countenance, which even an apostle declares to be
inaccessible (<span id="iv.i.vii-p12.1"></span>[1 Tim.
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.i.vii-p12.1"></span>), is a kind of labyrinth,—a labyrinth to us
inextricable, if the Word do not serve us as a thread to guide our path;
and that it is better to limp in the way, than run with the greatest
swiftness out of it. Hence the Psalmist, after repeatedly declaring
(<span id="iv.i.vii-p12.2"></span>[Ps.
93:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#000.md), [Ps.
96:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#000.md), [Ps.
97:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#000.md), [Ps.
99:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.i.vii-p12.2"></span>,
&c). that superstition should be banished from the world in order that
pure religion may flourish, introduces God as *reigning*; meaning by the
term, not the power which he possesses and which he exerts in the
government of universal nature, but the doctrine by which he maintains
his due supremacy: because error never can be eradicated from the heart
of man until the true knowledge of God has been implanted in it.

<span id="iv.i.vii-p13"></span>4. Accordingly, the same prophet, after
mentioning that the heavens declare the glory of God, that the firmament
sheweth forth the works of his hands, that the regular succession of day
and night proclaim his Majesty, proceeds to make mention of the
Word:—“The law of the Lord,” says he, “is perfect, converting the soul;
the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes
of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord
is pure, enlightening the eyes,” (<span
id="iv.i.vii-p13.1"></span>[Psalm
19:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.i.vii-p13.1"></span>). For though the law has other uses besides
(as to which, see Book 2 c. 7, sec. 6, 10, 12), the general meaning is,
that it is the proper school for training the children of God; the
invitation given to all nations, to behold him in the heavens and earth,
proving of no avail. The same view is taken in the 29th Psalm, where the
Psalmist, after discoursing on the dreadful voice of God, which, in
thunder, wind, rain, whirlwind, and tempest, shakes the earth, makes the
mountains tremble, and breaks the cedars, concludes by saying, “that in
his temple does every one speak of his glory,” unbelievers being deaf to
all God’s words when they echo in the air. In like manner another Psalm,
after describing the raging billows of the sea, thus concludes, “Thy
testimonies are very sure; holiness becometh thine house for ever,”
(<span id="iv.i.vii-p13.2"></span>[Psalm
93:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.i.vii-p13.2"></span>). To the same effect are the words of our
Saviour to the Samaritan woman, when he told her that her nation and all
other nations worshipped they knew not what; and that the Jews alone
gave worship to the true God (<span id="iv.i.vii-p13.3"></span>[John
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.i.vii-p13.3"></span>). Since the human mind, through its
weakness, was altogether unable to come to God if not aided and upheld
by his sacred word, it necessarily followed that all mankind, the Jews
excepted, inasmuch as they sought God without the Word, were labouring
under vanity and error.
