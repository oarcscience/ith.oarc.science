### <span id="iv.iii.xv-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 14.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p1"></span>THE BEGINNING OF JUSTIFICATION. IN WHAT
SENSE PROGRESSIVE.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p2"></span>To illustrate what has been already said,
and show what kind of righteousness man can have during the whole course
of his life, mankind are divided into four classes. I. First class
considered, sec. 1-6. II. Second and third classes considered together,
sec. 7, 8. III. Fourth class considered, sec. 9 to end.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p3"></span>*Sections*.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p4"></span>1. Men either idolatrous, profane,
hypocritical, or regenerate. 1. Idolaters void of righteousness, full of
unrighteousness, and hence in the sight of God altogether wretched and
undone.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p5"></span>2. Still a great difference in the
characters of men. This difference manifested. 1. In the gifts of God.
2. In the distinction between honorable and base. 3. In the blessings of
he present life.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p6"></span>3. All human virtue, how praiseworthy
soever it may appear, is corrupted. 1. By impurity of heart. 2. By the
absence of a proper nature.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p7"></span>4. By the want of Christ, without whom
there is no life.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p8"></span>5. Natural condition of man as described
by Scripture. All men dead in sins before regeneration.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p9"></span>6. Passages of Scripture to this effect.
Vulgar error confounding the righteousness of works with the redemption
purchased by Christ.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p10"></span>7. The second and third classes of men,
comprehending hypocrites and Christians in name only. Every action of
theirs deserves condemnation. Passage from Haggai. Objection. Answer.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p11"></span>8. Other passages. Quotations from
Augustine and Gregory.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p12"></span>9. The fourth class—viz. the regenerate.
Though guided by the Spirit, corruption adheres to all they do,
especially when brought to the bar of God.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p13"></span>10. One fault sufficient to efface all
former righteousness. Hence they cannot possibly be justified by works.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p14"></span>11. In addition to the two former
arguments, a third adduced against the Sophists, to show that whatever
be the works of the regenerate, they are justified solely by faith and
the free imputation of Christ’s righteousness.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p15"></span>12. Sophism of the Schoolmen in
opposition to the above doctrine. Answer.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p16"></span>13. Answer explained. Refutation of the
fiction of partial righteousness, and compensation by works of
supererogation. This fiction necessarily falls with that of
satisfaction.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p17"></span>14. Statement of our Savior—viz. that
after we have done all, we are still unprofitable servants.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p18"></span>15. Objection founded on Paul’s
boasting. Answer, showing the Apostle’s meaning. Other answers, stating
the general doctrine out of Chrysostom. Third answer, showing that
supererogation is the merest vanity.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p19"></span>16. Fourth answer, showing how Scripture
dissuades us from all confidence in works. Fifth answer, showing that we
have no ground of boasting.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p20"></span>17. Sixth answer, showing, in regard to
four different classes, that works have no part in procuring our
salvation. 1. The efficient cause is the free love of the Father. 2. The
material cause is Christ acquiring righteousness for us. 3. The
instrumental cause is faith. 4. The final cause the display of the
divine justice and praise of the divine goodness.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p21"></span>18. A second objection, founded on the
glorying of saints. An answer, explaining these modes of expression. How
the saints feel in regard to the certainty of salvation. The opinion
they have of their own works as in the sight of God.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p22"></span>19. Another answer—viz. that the elect,
by this kind of glorying, refer only to their adoption by the Father as
proved by the fruits of their calling. The order of this glorying. Its
foundation, structure, and parts.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p23"></span>20. Conclusion. The saints neither
attribute anything to the merits of works, nor derogate in any degree
from the righteousness which they obtain in Christ. Confirmation from a
passage of Augustine, in which he gives two reasons why no believer will
presume to boast before God of his works.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p24"></span>21. A third objection—viz. that the good
works of believers are the causes of divine blessings. Answer. There are
inferior causes, but these depend on free justification, which is the
only true cause why God blesses us. These modes of expression designate
the order of sequence rather than the cause.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p25"></span>1. In farther illustration of the
subject, let us consider what kind of righteousness man can have, during
the whole course of his life, and for this purpose let us make a
fourfold division. Mankind, either endued with no knowledge of God, are
sunk in idolatry; or, initiated in the sacraments, but by the impurity
of their lives denying him whom they confess with their mouths, are
Christians in name only; or they are hypocrites, who with empty glosses
hide the iniquity of the heart; or they are regenerated by the Spirit of
God, and aspire to true holiness. In the first place, when men are
judged by their natural endowments, not a iota of good will be found
from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, unless we are to
charge Scripture with falsehood, when it describes all the sons of Adam
by such terms as these: “The heart is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked.” “The imagination of man’s heart is evil from his
youth.” “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity.”
“They are all gone aside: they are altogether become filthy; there is
none that does good, no, not one.” In short, that they are *flesh*,
under which name are comprehended all those works which are enumerated
by Paul; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness idolatry
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife, seditions,
heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and all kinds of
pollution and abomination which it is possible to imagine.42  <span
id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) Such, then, is the worth on which men
are to plume themselves. But if any among them possess an integrity of
manners which presents some semblance of sanctity among men, yet because
we know that God regards not the outward appearance, we must penetrate
to the very source of action, if we would see how far works avail for
righteousness. We must, I say, look within, and see from what affection
of the heart these works proceed. This is a very wide field of
discussion, but as the matter may be explained in few words, I will use
as much brevity as I can.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p27"></span>2. First, then, I deny not, that
whatever excellent endowments appear in unbelievers42  <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) are divine gifts. Nor do I set myself
so much in opposition to common sense, as to contend that there was no
difference between the justice, moderation, and equity of Titus and
Trojan, and the rage, intemperance, and cruelty of Caligula, Nero, and
Domitian; between the continence of Vespasian, and the obscene lusts of
Tiberius; and (not to dwell on single virtues and vices) between the
observance of law and justice, and the contempt of them. So great is the
difference between justice and injustice, that it may be seen even where
the former is only a lifeless image. For what order would remain in the
world if we were to confound them? Hence this distinction between
honorable and base actions God has not only engraven on the minds of
each, but also often confirms in the administration of his providence.
For we see how he visits those who cultivate virtue with many temporal
blessings. Not that that external image of virtue in the least degree
merits his favor, but he is pleased thus to show how much he delights in
true righteousness, since he does not leave even the outward semblance
of it to go unrewarded. Hence it follows, as we lately observed, that
those virtues, or rather images of virtues, of whatever kind, are divine
gifts, since there is nothing in any degree praiseworthy which proceeds
not from him.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p29"></span>3. Still the observation of Augustine is
true, that all who are strangers to the true God, however excellent they
may be deemed on account of their virtues are more deserving of
punishment than of reward, because, by the pollution of their heart,
they contaminate the pure gifts of God (August. contra Julia. Lib. 4).
For though they are instruments of God to preserve human society by
justice, continence, friendship, temperance, fortitude, and prudence,
yet they execute these good works of God in the worst manner, because
they are kept from acting ill, not by a sincere love of goodness, but
merely by ambition or self-love, or some other sinister affection.
Seeing then that these actions are polluted as in their very source, by
impurity of heart, they have no better title to be classed among virtues
than vices, which impose upon us by their affinity or resemblance to
virtue. In short, when we remember that the object at which
righteousness always aims is the service of God, whatever is of a
different tendency deservedly forfeits the name. Hence, as they have no
regard to the end which the divine wisdom prescribes, although from the
performance the act seems good, yet from the perverse motive it is sin.
Augustine, therefore, concludes that all the Fabriciuses, the Scipios,
and Catos,42  <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) in their
illustrious deeds, sinned in this, that, wanting the light of faith,
they did not refer them to the proper end, and that, therefore, there
was no true righteousness in them, because duties are estimated not by
acts but by motives.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p31"></span>4. Besides, if it is true, as John says,
that there is no life without the Son of God (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p31.1"></span>[1 John
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p31.1"></span>), those who have no part in Christ, whoever
they be, whatever they do or devise, are hastening on, during their
whole career, to destruction and the judgment of eternal death. For this
reason, Augustine says, “Our religion distinguishes the righteous from
the wicked, by the law, not of works but of faith, without which works
which seem good are converted into sins,” (August. ad Bonif. Lib. 3, c.
5). He finely expresses the same idea in another passage, when he
compares the zeal of such men to those who in a race mistake the course
(August. Præf in <span id="iv.iii.xv-p31.2"></span>[Ps.
31](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#000)<span id="iv.iii.xv-p31.2"></span>.md).
He who is off the course, the more swiftly he runs is the more distant
from the goal and, therefore, the more unhappy. It is better to limp in
the way than run out of the way. Lastly, as there is no sanctification
without union with Christ, it is evident that they are bad trees which
are beautiful and fair to look upon, and may even produce fruit, sweet
to the taste, but are still very far from good. Hence we easily perceive
that every thing which man thinks, designs, and performs, before he is
reconciled to God by faith, is cursed, and not only of no avail for
justification, but merits certain damnation. And why do we talk of this
as if it were doubtful, when it has already been proved by the testimony
of an apostle, that “without faith it is impossible to please God?”
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p31.3"></span>[Heb.
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p31.3"></span>).

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32"></span>5. But the proof will be still clearer
if divine grace is set in opposition to the natural condition of man.
For Scripture everywhere proclaims that God finds nothing in man to
induce him to show kindness, but that he prevents him by free
liberality. What can a dead man do to obtain life? But when he
enlightens us with the knowledge of himself, he is said to raise us from
the dead, and make us new creatures (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.1"></span>[John
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.1"></span>). On this ground we see that the kindness
of God toward us is often commended, especially by the apostle: “God,”
says he, “who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved
us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with
Christ,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.2"></span>[Eph.
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.2"></span>). In another passage, when treating of the
general call of believers under the type of Abraham, he says, “God
quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though
they were,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.3"></span>[Rom.
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.3"></span>). If we are nothing, what, pray, can we do?
Wherefore, in the Book of Job the Lord sternly represses all arrogance
in these words, “Who has prevented me, that I should repay him?
whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.4"></span>[Job
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.4"></span>). Paul explaining this sentence applies it
in this way,—Let us not imagine that we bring to the Lord any thing but
the mere disgrace of want and destitution (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.5"></span>[Rom.
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.5"></span>). Wherefore, in the passage above quoted,
to prove that we attain to the hope of salvation, not by works but only
by grace, he affirms that “we are his workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk
in them,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.6"></span>[Eph.
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.6"></span>); as if he had said, Who of us can boast of
having challenged God by his righteousness, seeing our first power to
act aright is derived from regeneration? For, as we are formed by
nature, sooner shall oil be extracted from stone than good works from
us. It is truly strange how man, convicted of such ignominy, dares still
to claim any thing as his own. Let us acknowledge, therefore, with that
chosen vessel, that God “has called us with an holy calling, not
according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace;” and
“that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward men appeared not by
works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he
saved us;” that being justified by his grace, we might become the heirs
of everlasting life (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.7"></span>[2 Tim.
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.7"></span>;
<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.8"></span>[Titus
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005)<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.8"></span>.md).
By this confession we strip man of every particle of righteousness,
until by mere mercy he is regenerated unto the hope of eternal life,
since it is not true to say we are justified by grace, if works
contribute in any degree to our justification. The apostle undoubtedly
had not forgotten himself in declaring that justification is gratuitous,
seeing he argues in another place, that if works are of any avail,
“grace is no more grace,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.9"></span>[Rom.
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.9"></span>). And what else does our Lord mean, when he
declares, “I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance?” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p32.10"></span>[Mt.
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p32.10"></span>). If sinners alone are admitted, why do we
seek admission by means of fictitious righteousness?

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p33"></span>6. The thought is ever and anon
recurring to me, that I am in danger of insulting the mercy of God by
laboring with so much anxiety to maintain it, as if it were doubtful or
obscure. Such, however, is our malignity in refusing to concede to God
what belongs to him until most strongly urged that I am obliged to
insist at greater length. But as Scripture is clear enough on this
subject, I shall contend in its words rather than my own. Isaiah, after
describing the universal destruction of the human race, finely subjoins
the method of restitution. “The Lord saw it, and it displeased him that
there was no judgment. And he saw that there was no man, and wondered
that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto
him; and his righteousness, it sustained him” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.1"></span>[Isa.
59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.1"></span>). Where is our righteousness, if the
prophet says truly, that no man in recovering salvation gives any
assistance to the Lord? Thus another prophet, introducing the Lord as
treating concerning the reconciliation of sinners, says, “I will betroth
thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in
righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.”
“I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.2"></span>[Hos.
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.2"></span>). If a covenant of this kind, evidently
forming our first union with God, depends on mercy, there is no
foundation left for our righteousness. And, indeed, I would fain know,
from those who pretend that man meets God with some righteousness of
works, whether they imagine there is any kind of righteousness save that
which is acceptable to Him. If it were insane to think so, can any thing
agreeable to God proceed from his enemies, whom he abominates with all
their deeds? Truth declares that we are all the avowed and inveterate
enemies of God until we are justified and admitted to his friendship
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p33.3"></span>[Rom.
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.iii.xv-p33.3"></span>;
<span id="iv.iii.xv-p33.4"></span>[Col.
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.4"></span>). If justification is the beginning of
love, how can the righteousness of works precede it? Hence John, to put
down the arrogant idea, carefully reminds us that God first loved us
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p33.5"></span>[1 John
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.5"></span>). The Lord had formerly taught the same
thing by his Prophet: “I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned
away from him,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p33.6"></span>[Hosea
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.6"></span>). Assuredly he is not influenced by works
if his love turns to us spontaneously. But the rude and vulgar idea
entertained is, that we did not merit the interposition of Christ for
our redemption, but that we are aided by our works in obtaining
possession of it. On the contrary, though we may be redeemed by Christ,
still, until we are ingrafted into union with him by the calling of the
Father, we are darkness, the heirs of death, and the enemies of God. For
Paul declares that we are not purged and washed from our impurities by
the blood of Christ until the Spirit accomplishes that cleansing in us
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p33.7"></span>[1 Cor.
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.7"></span>). Peter, intending to say the same thing,
declares that the sanctification of the Spirit avails “unto obedience
and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.8"></span>[1 Pet.
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.8"></span>). If the sprinkling of the blood of Christ
by the Spirit gives us purification, let us not think that, previous to
this sprinkling, we are anything but sinners without Christ. Let us,
therefore, hold it as certain, that the beginning of our salvation is as
it were a resurrection from death unto life, because, when it is given
us on behalf of Christ to believe on him (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.9"></span>[Phil.
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p33.9"></span>), then only do we begin to pass from death
unto life.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p34"></span>7. Under this head the second and third
class of men noted in the above division is comprehended. Impurity of
conscience proves that as yet neither of these classes is regenerated by
the Spirit of God. And, again, their not being regenerated proves their
want of faith. Whence it is clear that they are not yet reconciled, not
yet justified, since it is only by faith that these blessings are
obtained. What can sinners, alienated from God, produce save that which
is abominable in his sight? Such, however, is the stupid confidence
entertained by all the wicked, and especially by hypocrites, that
however conscious that their whole heart teems with impurity, they yet
deem any spurious works which they may perform as worthy of the
approbation of God. Hence the pernicious consequence, that though
convicted of a wicked and impious minds they cannot be induced to
confess that they are devoid of righteousness. Even acknowledging
themselves to be unrighteous, because they cannot deny it, they yet
arrogate to themselves some degree of righteousness. This vanity the
Lord admirably refutes by the prophet: “Ask now the priests concerning
the law, saying, If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and
with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat,
shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. Then said
Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall
it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation
before me, saith the Lord; and so is every work of their hands; and that
which they offer there is unclean,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p34.1"></span>[Haggai
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p34.1"></span>). I wish these sentiments could obtain full
credit with us, and be deeply fixed on our memories. For there is no
man, however flagitous the whole tenor of his life may be, who will
allow himself to be convinced of what the Lord here so clearly declares.
As soon as any person, even the most wicked, has performed some one duty
of the law, he hesitates not to impute it to himself for righteousness;
but the Lord declares that no degree of holiness is thereby acquired,
unless the heart has previously been made pure. And not contented with
this, he declares that all the works performed by sinners are
contaminated by impurity of heart. Let us cease then to give the name of
righteousness to works which the mouth of the Lord condemns as polluted.
How well is this shown by that elegant similitude? It might be objected,
that what the Lord has commanded is inviolably holy. But he, on the
contrary, replies, that it is not strange that those things which are
sanctified in the law are contaminated by the impurity of the wicked,
the unclean hand profaning that which is sacred by handling it.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p35"></span>8. The same argument is admirably
followed out by Isaiah: “Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an
abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of
assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
Your new moons and your appointed feasts my foul hateth: they are a
trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them. And when ye spread forth your
hands I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I
will not hear: your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean;
put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p35.1"></span>[Isaiah
1:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p35.1"></span>, compared with ch. 58) What is meant by the
Lord thus nauseating the observance of his law? Nay, indeed, he does not
repudiate any thing relating to the genuine observance of the law, the
beginning of which is as he uniformly declares the sincere fear of his
name. When this is wanting, all the services which are offered to him
are not only nugatory but vile and abominable. Let hypocrites now go,
and while keeping depravity wrapt up in their heart, study to lay God
under obligation by their works. In this way they will only offend him
more and more. “The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the
Lord; but the prayer of the upright is his delight,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p35.2"></span>[Prov.
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p35.2"></span>. ) We hold it, therefore, as indubitable,
indeed it should be notorious to all tolerably verdant with Scriptures
that the most splendid works performed by men, who are not yet truly
sanctified, are so far from being righteousness in the sight of the
Lord, that he regards them as sins. And, therefore it is taught with
perfect truth, that no man procures favor with God by means of works,
but that, on the contrary, works are not pleasing to God unless the
person has previously found favor in his sight.42  <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) Here we should carefully observe the
order which scripture sets before us. Moses says that “the Lord had
respect unto Abel and to his offering,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p36.1"></span>[Gen.
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p36.1"></span>). Observe how he says that the Lord was
propitious (had respect) to Abel, before he had respect to his works.
Wherefore, purification of heart ought to precede, in order that the
works performed by us may be graciously accepted by God: for the saying
of Jeremiah is always true, “O Lord, are not thine eyes upon the truth?”
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p36.2"></span>[Jer.
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p36.2"></span>). Moreover the Holy Spirit declared by the
mouth of Peter, that it is by faith alone the heart is purified (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p36.3"></span>[Acts
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p36.3"></span>). Hence it is evident, that the primary
foundation is in true and living faith.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p37"></span>9. Let us now see what kind of
righteousness belongs to those persons whom we have placed in the fourth
class. We admits that when God reconciles us to himself by the
intervention of the righteousness of Christ, and bestowing upon us the
free pardon of sins regards us as righteous, his goodness is at the same
time conjoined with mercy, so that he dwells in us by means of his Holy
Spirit, by whose agency the lusts of our flesh are every day more and
more mortified while that we ourselves are sanctified; that is
consecrated to the Lord for true purity of life, our hearts being
trained to the obedience of the law. It thus becomes our leading desire
to obey his will, and in all things advance his glory only. Still,
however while we walk in the ways of the Lord, under the guidance of the
Holy Spirit, lest we should become unduly elated, and forget ourselves,
we have still remains of imperfection which serve to keep us humble:
“There is no man that sinneth not,” saith Scripture (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p37.1"></span>[1 Kings
8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p37.1"></span>). What righteousness then can men obtain by
their works? First, I say, that the best thing which can be produced by
them is always tainted and corrupted by the impurity of the flesh, and
has, as it were, some mixture of dross in it. Let the holy servant of
God, I say, select from the whole course of his life the action which he
deems most excellent, and let him ponder it in all its parts; he will
doubtless find in it something that savors of the rottenness of the
flesh, since our alacrity in well-doing is never what it ought to be,
but our course is always retarded by much weakness. Although we see
theft the stains by which the works of the righteous are blemished, are
by no means unapparent, still, granting that they are the minutest
possible, will they give no offense to the eye of God, before which even
the stars are not clean? We thus see, that even saints cannot perform
one work which, if judged on its own merits, is not deserving of
condemnation.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p38"></span>10. Even were it possible for us to
perform works absolutely pure, yet one sin is sufficient to efface and
extinguish all remembrance of former righteousness, as the prophet says
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p38.1"></span>[Ezek.
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p38.1"></span>). With this James agrees, “Whosoever shall
keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p38.2"></span>[James
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p38.2"></span>). And since this mortal life is never
entirely free from the taint of sin, whatever righteousness we could
acquire would ever and anon be corrupted, overwhelmed, and destroyed, by
subsequent sins, so that it could not stand the scrutiny of God, or be
imputed to us for righteousness. In short, whenever we treat of the
righteousness of works, we must look not to the legal work but to the
command. Therefore, when righteousness is sought by the Law, it is in
vain to produce one or two single works; we must show an uninterrupted
obedience. God does not (as many foolishly imagine) impute that
forgiveness of sins once for all, as righteousness; so that having
obtained the pardon of our past life we may afterwards seek
righteousness in the Law. This were only to mock and delude us by the
entertainment of false hopes. For since perfection is altogether
unattainable by us, so long as we are clothed with flesh, and the Law
denounces death and judgment against all who have not yielded a perfect
righteousness, there will always be ground to accuse and convict us
unless the mercy of God interpose, and ever and anon absolve us by the
constant remission of sins. Wherefore the statement which we set out is
always true, If we are estimated by our own worthiness, in every thing
that we think or devise, with all our studies and endeavors we deserve
death and destruction.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p39"></span>11. We must strongly insist on these two
things: That no believer ever performed one work which, if tested by the
strict judgment of God, could escape condemnation; and, moreover, that
were this granted to be possible (though it is not), yet the act being
vitiated and polluted by the sins of which it is certain that the author
of it is guilty, it is deprived of its merit. This is the cardinal point
of the present discussion. There is no controversy between us and the
sounder Schoolmen as to the beginning of justification.42  <span
id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) They admit that the sinner, freely
delivered from condemnation, obtains justification, and that by
forgiveness of sins; but under the term justification they comprehend
the renovation by which the Spirit forms us anew to the obedience of the
Law; and in describing the righteousness of the regenerate man, maintain
that being once reconciled to God by means of Christ, he is afterwards
deemed righteous by his good works, and is accepted in consideration of
them. The Lord, on the contrary, declares, that he imputed Abraham’s
faith for righteousness (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p40.1"></span>[Rom.
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p40.1"></span>), not at the time when he was still a
worshipper of idols, but after he had been many years distinguished for
holiness. Abraham had long served God with a pure heart, and performed
that obedience of the Law which a mortal man is able to perform: yet his
righteousness still consisted in faith. Hence we infer, according to the
reasoning of Paul, that it was *not of works*. In like manners when the
prophet says, “The just shall live by his faith,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p40.2"></span>[Hab.
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p40.2"></span>), he is not speaking of the wicked and
profane, whom the Lord justifies by converting them to the faith: his
discourse is directed to believers, and life is promised to them by
faith. Paul also removes every doubt, when in confirmation of this
sentiment he quotes the words of David, “Blessed is he whose
transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p40.3"></span>[Ps.
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p40.3"></span>). It is certain that David is not speaking
of the ungodly but of believers such as he himself was, because he was
giving utterance to the feelings of his own mind. Therefore we must have
this blessedness not once only, but must hold it fast during our whole
lives. Moreover, the message of free reconciliation with God is not
promulgated for one or two days, but is declared to be perpetual in the
Church (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p40.4"></span>[2 Cor.
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p40.4"></span>). Hence believers have not even to the end
of life any other righteousness than that which is there described.
Christ ever remains a Mediator to reconcile the Father to us, and there
is a perpetual efficacy in his death—viz. ablution, satisfaction,
expiation; in short, perfect obedience, by which all our iniquities are
covered. In the Epistle to the Ephesians, Paul says not that the
beginning of salvation is of grace, but “by grace are ye saved,” “not of
works, lest any man should boast,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p40.5"></span>[Eph. 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#009)<span id="iv.iii.xv-p40.5"></span>.md).

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p41"></span>12. The subterfuges by which the
Schoolmen here endeavor to escape will not disentangle them. They say
that good works are not of such intrinsic worth as to be sufficient to
procure justification, but it is owing to accepting grace that they have
this effect. Then because they are forced to confess that here the
righteousness of works is always imperfect, they grant that so long as
we are in this life we stand in need of the forgiveness of sin in order
to supply the deficiency of works, but that the faults which are
committed are compensated by works of supererogation. I answer, that the
grace which they call accepting, is nothing else than the free goodness
with which the Father embraces us in Christ when he clothes us with the
innocence of Christ, and accepts it as ours, so that in consideration of
it he regards us as holy, pure, and innocent. For the righteousness of
Christ (as it alone is perfect, so it alone can stand the scrutiny of
God) must be sisted for us, and as a surety represent us judicially.
Provided with this righteousness, we constantly obtain the remission of
sins through faith. Our imperfection and impurity, covered with this
purity, are not imputed but are as it were buried, so as not to come
under judgment until the hour arrive when the old man being destroyed,
and plainly extinguished in us, the divine goodness shall receive us
into beatific peace with the new Adam, there to await the day of the
Lord, on which, being clothed with incorruptible bodies, we shall be
translated to the glory of the heavenly kingdom.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p42"></span>13. If these things are so, it is
certain that our works cannot in themselves make us agreeable and
acceptable to God, and even cannot please God, except in so far as being
covered with the righteousness of Christ we thereby please him and
obtain forgiveness of sins. God has not promised life as the reward of
certain works, but only declares, “which if a man do, he shall live in
them,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p42.1"></span>[Lev.
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p42.1"></span>), denouncing the well-known curse against
all who do not continue in all things that are written in the book of
the Law to do them. In this way is completely refuted the fiction of a
partial righteousness, the only righteousness acknowledged in heaven
being the perfect observance of the Law. There is nothing more solid in
their dogma of compensation by means of works of supererogation. For
must they not always return to the proposition which has already been
disproved—viz. that he who observes the Law in part is so far justified
by works? This, which no man of sound judgment will concede to them,
they are not ashamed to take for granted. The Lord having so often
declared that he recognizes no justification by works unless they be
works by which the Law is perfectly fulfilled,—how perverse is it, while
we are devoid of such works, to endeavor to secure some ground of
glorying to ourselves; that is not to yield it entirely to God, by
boasting of some kind of fragments of works, and trying to supply the
deficiency by other satisfactions? Satisfactions have already been so
completely disposed of, that we ought never again even to dream of them.
Here all I say is, that those who thus trifle with sin do not at all
consider how execrable it is in the sight of God; if they did, they
would assuredly understand, that all the righteousness of men collected
into one heap would be inadequate to compensate for a single sin. For we
see that by one sin man was so cast off and forsaken by God, that he at
the same time lost all power of recovering salvation. He was, therefore,
deprived of the power of giving satisfaction. Those who flatter
themselves with this idea will never satisfy God, who cannot possibly
accept or be pleased with anything that proceeds from his enemies. But
all to whom he imputes sin are enemies, and, therefore, our sins must be
covered and forgiven before the Lord has respect to any of our works.
From this it follows, that the forgiveness of sins is gratuitous, and
this forgiveness is wickedly insulted by those who introduce the idea of
satisfaction. Let us, therefore, after the example of the Apostle,
“forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those
things which are before,” “press toward the mark for the prize of the
high calling of God in Jesus Christ,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p42.2"></span>[Phil.
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p42.2"></span>).

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p43"></span>14. How can boasting in works of
supererogation agree with the command given to us: “When ye shall have
done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
servants: we have done that which was our duty to do?” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p43.1"></span>[Luke
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p43.1"></span>). To say or speak in the presence of God is
not to feign or lie, but to declare what we hold as certain. Our Lord,
therefore, enjoins us sincerely to feel and consider with ourselves that
we do not perform gratuitous duties, but pay him service which is due.
And truly. For the obligations of service under which we lie are so
numerous that we cannot discharge them though all our thoughts and
members were devoted to the observance of the Law; and, therefore, when
he says “When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded
you,” it is just as if he had said that all the righteousness of men
would not amount to one of these things. Seeing, then, that every one is
very far distant from that goal, how can we presume to boast of having
accumulated more than is due? It cannot be objected that a person,
though failing in some measure in what is necessary, may yet in
intention go beyond what is necessary. For it must ever be held that in
whatever pertains to the worship of God, or to charity, nothing can ever
be thought of that is not comprehended under the Law. But if it is part
of the Law, let us not boast of voluntary liberality in matters of
necessary obligation.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p44"></span>15. On this subject, they ceaselessly
allege the boast of Paul, that among the Corinthians he spontaneously
renounced a right which, if he had otherwise chosen, he might have
exercised (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p44.1"></span>[1 Cor.
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p44.1"></span>); thus not only paying what he owed them in
duty, but gratuitously bestowing upon them more than duty required. They
ought to have attended to the reason there expressed, that his object
was to avoid giving offense to the weak. For wicked and deceitful
workmen employed this pretence of kindness that they might procure favor
to their pernicious dogmas, and excite hatred against the Gospel, so
that it was necessary for Paul either to peril the doctrine of Christ,
or to thwart their schemes. Now, if it is a matter of indifference to a
Christian man whether or not he cause a scandal when it is in his power
to avoid it, then I admit that the Apostle performed a work of
supererogation to his Master; but if the thing which he did was justly
required in a prudent minister of the Gospel, then I say he did what he
was bound to do. In short, even when no such reason appears, yet the
saying of Chrysostom is always true, that everything which we have is
held on the same condition as the private property of slaves; it is
always due to our Master. Christ does not disguise this in the parable,
for he asks in regard to the master who, on return from his labour,
requires his servant to gird himself and serve him, “Does he thank that
servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p44.2"></span>[Luke
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p44.2"></span>). But possibly the servant was more
industrious than the master would have ventured to exact. Be it so:
still he did nothing to which his condition as a servant did not bind
him, because his utmost ability is his master’s. I say nothing as to the
kind of supererogations on which these men would plume themselves before
God. They are frivolities which he never commanded, which he approves
not, and will not accept when they come to give in their account. The
only sense in which we admit works of supererogation is that expressed
by the prophet, when he says, “Who has required this at your hand?”
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p44.3"></span>[Isaiah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p44.3"></span>). But let them remember what is elsewhere
said of them: “Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread?
and your labour for that which satisfieth not?” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p44.4"></span>[Isaiah
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p44.4"></span>). It is, indeed, an easy matter for these
indolent Rabbis to carry on such discussions sitting in their soft
chairs under the shade, but when the Supreme Judge shall sit on his
tribunal, all these blustering dogmas will behave to disappear.42  <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) This, this I say, was the true
question: not what we can fable and talk in schools and corners, but
what ground of defense we can produce at his judgment-seat.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p46"></span>16. In this matter the minds of men must
be specially guarded against two pestiferous dogmas—viz. against putting
any confidence in the righteousness of works, or ascribing any glory to
them. From all such confidence the Scriptures uniformly dissuade us when
they declare that our righteousness is offensive in the sight of God
unless it derives a sweet odour from the purity of Christ: that it can
have no other effect than to excite the divine vengeance unless
sustained by his indulgent mercy. Accordingly, the only thing they leave
to us is to deprecate our Judge with that confession of David: “Enter
not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no living be
justified,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p46.1"></span>[Psalm
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p46.1"></span>). And when Job says, “If I be wicked, woe
unto me: and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p46.2"></span>[Job
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p46.2"></span>). Although he refers to that spotless
righteousness of God, before which even angels are not clean, he however
shows, that when brought to the bar of Gods all that mortals can do is
to stand dumb. He does not merely mean that he chooses rather to give
way spontaneously than to risk a contest with the divine severity, but
that he was not conscious of possessing any righteousness that would not
fall the very first moment it was brought into the presence of God.
Confidence being banished, all glorying must necessarily cease. For who
can attribute any merit of righteousness to works, which instead of
giving confidence, only make us tremble in the presence of God? We must,
therefore, come to what Isaiah invites us: “In the Lord shall all the
seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p46.3"></span>[Isaiah
45:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p46.3"></span>); for it is most true, as he elsewhere
says, that we are “the planting of the Lord, that he might be
glorified,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p46.4"></span>[Isaiah
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p46.4"></span>). Our soul, therefore, will not be duly
purified until it ceases to have any confidence, or feel any exultation
in works. Foolish men are puffed up to this false and lying confidence
by the erroneous idea that the cause of their salvation is in works.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p47"></span>17. But if we attend to the four kinds
of causes which philosophers bring under our view in regard to effects,
we shall find that not one of them is applicable to works as a cause of
salvation. The efficient cause of our eternal salvation the Scripture
uniformly proclaims to be the mercy and free love of the heavenly Father
towards us; the material cause to be Christ, with the obedience by which
he purchased righteousness for us; and what can the formal or
instrumental cause be but faith? John includes the three in one sentence
when he says, “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have
everlasting life,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p47.1"></span>[John
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p47.1"></span>). The Apostle, moreover, declares that the
final cause is the demonstration of the divine righteousness and the
praise of his goodness. There also he distinctly mentions the other
three causes; for he thus speaks to the Romans: “All have sinned, and
come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace,”
(<span id="iv.iii.xv-p47.2"></span>[Rom.
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p47.2"></span>). You have here the head and primary
source—God has embraced us with free mercy. The next words are, “through
the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;” this is as it were the material
cause by which righteousness is procured for us. “Whom God has set forth
to be a propitiation through faith.” Faith is thus the instrumental
cause by which righteousness is applied to us. He lastly subjoins the
final cause when he says, “To declare at this time his righteousness;
that he might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in
Jesus.” And to show by the way that this righteousness consists in
reconciliation, he says that Christ was “set forth to be a
propitiation.” Thus also, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, he tells us
that we are received into the favor of God by mere mercy; that this is
done by the intervention of Christ; that it is apprehended by faith; the
end of all being that the glory of the divine goodness may be fully
displayed. When we see that all the parts of our salvation thus exist
without us, what ground can we have for glorying or confiding in our
works? Neither as to the efficient nor the final cause can the most
sworn enemies of divine grace raise any controversy with us unless they
would abjure the whole of Scripture. In regard to the material or formal
cause they make a gloss, as if they held that our works divide the merit
with faith and the righteousness of Christ. But here also Scripture
reclaims, simply affirming that Christ is both righteousness and life,
and that the blessing of justification is possessed by faith alone.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p48"></span>18. When the saints repeatedly confirm
and console themselves with the remembrance of their innocence and
integrity, and sometimes even abstain not from proclaiming them, it is
done in two ways: either because by comparing their good cause with the
bad cause of the ungodly, they thence feel secure of victory, not so
much from commendation of their own righteousness, as from the just and
merited condemnation of their adversaries; or because, reviewing
themselves before God, even without any comparison with others the
purity of their conscience gives them some comfort and security. The
former reason will afterwards be considered (chap. 17, sec. 14, and
chap. 20, sec. 10); let us now briefly show, in regard to the latter,
how it accords with what we have above said, that we can have no
confidence in works before the bar of God, that we cannot glory in any
opinion of their worth. The accordance lies here, that when the point
considered is the constitution and foundation of salvation, believers,
without paying any respect to works, direct their eyes to the goodness
of God alone. Nor do they turn to it only in the first instance, as to
the commencement of blessedness, but rest in it as the completion.
Conscience being thus founded, built up, and established is farther
established by the consideration of works, inasmuch as they are proofs
of God dwelling and reigning in us. Since, then, this confidence in
works has no place unless you have previously fixed your whole
confidence on the mercy of God, it should not seem contrary to that on
which it depends. Wherefore, when we exclude confidence in works, we
merely mean, that the Christian mind must not turn back to the merit of
works as an aid to salvation, but must dwell entirely on the free
promise of justification. But we forbid no believer to confirm and
support this faith by the signs of the divine favor towards him. For if
when we call to mind the gifts which God has bestowed upon us, they are
like rays of the divine countenance, by which we are enabled to behold
the highest light of his goodness; much more is this the case with the
gift of good works, which shows that we have received the Spirit of
adoption.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p49"></span>19. When believers therefore feel their
faith strengthened by a consciousness of integrity, and entertain
sentiments of exultation, it is just because the fruits of their calling
convince them that the Lord has admitted them to a place among his
children. Accordingly, when Solomon says, “In the fear of the Lord is
strong confidence,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p49.1"></span>[Prov.
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p49.1"></span>), and when the saints sometimes beseech the
Lord to hear them, because they walked before his face in simplicity and
integrity (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p49.2"></span>[Gen.
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p49.2"></span>; <span id="iv.iii.xv-p49.3"></span>[2 Kings
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p49.3"></span>), these expressions apply not to laying the
foundation of a firm conscience, but are of force only when taken *a
posteriori*.43  <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) For there is no
where such a fear of God as can give full security, and the saints are
always conscious that any integrity which they may possess is mingled
with many remains of the flesh. But as the fruits of regeneration
furnish them with a proof of the Holy Spirit dwelling in them,
experiencing God to be a Father in a matter of so much moment, they are
strengthened in no slight degree to wait for his assistance in all their
necessities. Even this they could not do, had they not previously
perceived that the goodness of God is sealed to them by nothing but the
certainty of the promise. Should they begin to estimate it by their good
works, nothing will be weaker or more uncertain; works, when estimated
by themselves, no less proving the divine displeasure by their
imperfection, than his good-will by their incipient purity. In short,
while proclaiming the mercies of the Lord, they never lose sight of his
free favor, with all its “breadth and length, and depth and height,”
testified by Paul (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p50.1"></span>[Eph.
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p50.1"></span>); as if he had said, Whithersoever the
believer turns, however loftily he climbs, however far and wide his
thoughts extend, he must not go farther than the love of Christ, but
must be wholly occupied in meditating upon it, as including in itself
all dimensions. Accordingly, he declares that it “passeth knowledge,”
that “to know the love of Christ” is to “be filled with all the fulness
of God,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p50.2"></span>[Eph.
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p50.2"></span>). In another passage, where he glories that
believers are victorious in every contest, he adds the reason, “through
him that loved us,” (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p50.3"></span>[Rom.
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p50.3"></span>).

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p51"></span>20. We now see that believers have no
such confidence in works as to attribute any merit to them (since they
regard them only as divine gifts, in which they recognize his goodness,
and signs of calling, in which they discern their election); nor such
confidence as to derogate in any respect from the free righteousness of
Christ; since on this it depends, and without this cannot subsist. The
same thing is briefly but elegantly expressed by Augustine when he says,
“I do not say to the Lord, Despise not the works of my hands; I have
sought the Lord with my hands, and have not been deceived. But I commend
not the works of my hands, for I fear that when thou examinest them thou
wilt find more faults than merits. This only I say, this asks this
desire, Despise not the works of thy hands. See in me thy work, not
mine. If thou sees mine, thou condemnest; if thou sees thine own, thou
crownest. Whatever good works I have are of thee,” (August. in <span
id="iv.iii.xv-p51.1"></span>[Ps.
137](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p51.1"></span>). He gives two reasons for not venturing to
boast of his works before God: first, that if he has any good works, he
does not see in them any thing of his own; and, secondly, that these
works are overwhelmed by a multitude of sins. Whence it is, that the
conscience derives from them more fear and alarm than security.
Therefore, the only way in which he desires God to look at any work
which he may have done aright is, that he may therein see the grace of
his calling, and perfect the work which he has begun.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p52"></span>21. Moreover, when Scripture intimates
that the good works of believers are causes why the Lord does them good,
we must still understand the meaning so as to hold unshaken what has
previously been said—viz. that the efficient cause of our salvation is
placed in the love of God the Father; the material cause in the
obedience of the Son; the instrumental cause in the illumination of the
Spirit, that is, in faith; and the final cause in the praise of the
divine goodness. In this, however, there is nothing to prevent the Lord
from embracing works as inferior causes. But how so? In this way: Those
whom in mercy he has destined for the inheritance of eternal life, he,
in his ordinary administration, introduces to the possession of it by
means of good works. What precedes in the order of administration is
called the cause of what follows. For this reason, he sometimes makes
eternal life a consequent of works; not because it is to be ascribed to
them, but because those whom he has elected he justifies, that he may at
length glorify (<span id="iv.iii.xv-p52.1"></span>[Rom.
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p52.1"></span>); he makes the prior grace to be a kind of
cause, because it is a kind of step to that which follows. But whenever
the true cause is to be assigned, he enjoins us not to take refuge in
works, but to keep our thoughts entirely fixed on the mercy of God; “The
wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p52.2"></span>[Rom.
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xv-p52.2"></span>). Why, as he contrasts life with death,
does he not also contrast righteousness with sin? Why, when setting down
sin as the cause of death, does he not also set down righteousness as
the cause of life? The antithesis which would otherwise be complete is
somewhat marred by this variation; but the Apostle employed the
comparison to express the fact, that death is due to the deserts of men,
but that life was treasured up solely in the mercy of God. In short, by
these expressions, the order rather than the cause is noted.43  <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) The Lord adding grace to grace, takes
occasion from a former to add a subsequent, so that he may omit no means
of enriching his servants. Still, in following out his liberality, he
would have us always look to free election as its source and beginning.
For although he loves the gifts which he daily bestows upon us, inasmuch
as they proceed from that fountain, still our duty is to hold fast by
that gratuitous acceptance, which alone can support our souls; and so to
connect the gifts of the Spirit, which he afterwards bestows, with their
primary cause, as in no degree to detract from it.
