### <span id="iv.i.x-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 9.

<span id="iv.i.x-p1"></span>ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF PIETY SUBVERTED BY
FANATICS, WHO SUBSTITUTE REVELATIONS FOR SCRIPTURE.

<span id="iv.i.x-p2"></span>*Sections.*

<span id="iv.i.x-p3"></span>1. The temper and error of the Libertines,
who take to themselves the name of spiritual, briefly described. Their
refutation. 1. The Apostles and all true Christians have embraced the
written Word. This confirmed by a passage in Isaiah; also by the example
and words of Paul. 2. The Spirit of Christ seals the doctrine of the
written Word on the minds of the godly.

<span id="iv.i.x-p4"></span>2. Refutation continued. 3. The impositions
of Satan cannot be detected without the aid of the written Word. First
Objection. The Answer to it.

<span id="iv.i.x-p5"></span>3. Second Objection from the words of Paul
as to the *letter and spirit*. The Answer, with an explanation of Paul’s
meaning. How the Spirit and the written Word are indissolubly connected.

<span id="iv.i.x-p6"></span>1. Those who, rejecting Scripture, imagine
that they have some peculiar way of penetrating to God, are to be deemed
not so much under the influence of error as madness. For certain giddy
men7  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) have lately appeared, who,
while they make a great display of the superiority of the Spirit, reject
all reading of the Scriptures themselves, and deride the simplicity of
those who only delight in what they call the dead and deadly letter. But
I wish they would tell me what spirit it is whose inspiration raises
them to such a sublime height that they dare despise the doctrine of
Scripture as mean and childish. If they answer that it is the Spirit of
Christ, their confidence is exceedingly ridiculous; since they will, I
presume, admit that the apostles and other believers in the primitive
Church were not illuminated by any other Spirit. None of these thereby
learned to despise the word of God, but every one was imbued with
greater reverence for it, as their writings most clearly testify. And,
indeed, it had been so foretold by the mouth of Isaiah. For when he
says, “My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy
seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the Lord, from
henceforth and for ever,” he does not tie down the ancient Church to
external doctrine, as he were a mere teacher of elements;7  <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) he rather shows that, under the reign of
Christ, the true and full felicity of the new Church will consist in
their being ruled not less by the Word than by the Spirit of God. Hence
we infer that these miscreants are guilty of fearful sacrilege in
tearing asunder what the prophet joins in indissoluble union. Add to
this, that Paul, though carried up even to the third heaven, ceased not
to profit by the doctrine of the law and the prophets, while, in like
manner, he exhorts Timothy, a teacher of singular excellence, to give
attention to reading (<span id="iv.i.x-p8.1"></span>[1 Tim.
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013)<span id="iv.i.x-p8.1"></span>.md).
And the eulogium which he pronounces on Scripture well deserves to be
remembered—viz. that “it is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God
may be perfect,” (<span id="iv.i.x-p8.2"></span>[2 Tim.
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016)<span id="iv.i.x-p8.2"></span>.md).
What an infatuation of the devil, therefore, to fancy that Scripture,
which conducts the sons of God to the final goal, is of transient and
temporary use? Again, I should like those people to tell me whether they
have imbibed any other Spirit than that which Christ promised to his
disciples. Though their madness is extreme, it will scarcely carry them
the length of making this their boast. But what kind of Spirit did our
Saviour promise to send? One who should not speak of himself (<span
id="iv.i.x-p8.3"></span>[John
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013)<span id="iv.i.x-p8.3"></span>.md),
but suggest and instil the truths which he himself had delivered through
the word. Hence the office of the Spirit promised to us, is not to form
new and unheard-of revelations, or to coin a new form of doctrine, by
which we may be led away from the received doctrine of the gospel, but
to seal on our minds the very doctrine which the gospel recommends.

<span id="iv.i.x-p9"></span>2. Hence it is easy to understand that we
must give diligent heed both to the reading and hearing of Scripture, if
we would obtain any benefit from the Spirit of God (just as Peter
praises those who attentively study the doctrine of the prophets (<span
id="iv.i.x-p9.1"></span>[2 Pet.
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019)<span id="iv.i.x-p9.1"></span>.md),
though it might have been thought to be superseded after the gospel
light arose), and, on the contrary, that any spirit which passes by the
wisdom of God’s Word, and suggests any other doctrine, is deservedly
suspected of vanity and falsehood. Since Satan transforms himself into
an angel of light, what authority can the Spirit have with us if he be
not ascertained by an infallible mark? And assuredly he is pointed out
to us by the Lord with sufficient clearness; but these miserable men err
as if bent on their own destruction, while they seek the Spirit from
themselves rather than from Him. But they say that it is insulting to
subject the Spirit, to whom all things are to be subject, to the
Scripture: as if it were disgraceful to the Holy Spirit to maintain a
perfect resemblance throughout, and be in all respects without variation
consistent with himself. True, if he were subjected to a human, an
angelical, or to any foreign standard, it might be thought that he was
rendered subordinate, or, if you will, brought into bondage, but so long
as he is compared with himself, and considered in himself, how can it be
said that he is thereby injured? I admit that he is brought to a test,
but the very test by which it has pleased him that his majesty should be
confirmed. It ought to be enough for us when once we hear his voice; but
lest Satan should insinuate himself under his name, he wishes us to
recognise him by the image which he has stamped on the Scriptures. The
author of the Scriptures cannot vary, and change his likeness. Such as
he there appeared at first, such he will perpetually remain. There is
nothing contumelious to him in this, unless we are to think it would be
honourable for him to degenerate, and revolt against himself.

<span id="iv.i.x-p10"></span>3. Their cavil about our cleaving to the
dead letter carries with it the punishment which they deserve for
despising Scripture. It is clear that Paul is there arguing against
false apostles (<span id="iv.i.x-p10.1"></span>[2 Cor.
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)<span id="iv.i.x-p10.1"></span>.md),
who, by recommending the law without Christ, deprived the people of the
benefit of the New Covenant, by which the Lord engages that he will
write his law on the hearts of believers, and engrave it on their inward
parts. The letter therefore is dead, and the law of the Lord kills its
readers when it is dissevered from the grace of Christ, and only sounds
in the ear without touching the heart. But if it is effectually
impressed on the heart by the Spirit; if it exhibits Christ, it is the
word of life converting the soul, and making wise the simple. Nay, in
the very same passage, the apostle calls his own preaching the
ministration of the Spirit (<span id="iv.i.x-p10.2"></span>[2 Cor.
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008)<span id="iv.i.x-p10.2"></span>.md),
intimating that the Holy Spirit so cleaves to his own truth, as he has
expressed it in Scripture, that he then only exerts and puts forth his
strength when the word is received with due honour and respect.

<span id="iv.i.x-p11"></span>There is nothing repugnant here to what was
lately said (chap. 7) that we have no great certainty of the word
itself, until it be confirmed by the testimony of the Spirit. For the
Lord has so knit together the certainty of his word and his Spirit, that
our minds are duly imbued with reverence for the word when the Spirit
shining upon it enables us there to behold the face of God; and, on the
other hand, we embrace the Spirit with no danger of delusion when we
recognise him in his image, that is, in his word. Thus, indeed, it is.
God did not produce his word before men for the sake of sudden display,
intending to abolish it the moment the Spirit should arrive; but he
employed the same Spirit, by whose agency he had administered the word,
to complete his work by the efficacious confirmation of the word. In
this way Christ explained to the two disciples (<span
id="iv.i.x-p11.1"></span>[Luke
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#027)<span id="iv.i.x-p11.1"></span>.md),
not that they were to reject the Scriptures and trust to their own
wisdom, but that they were to understand the Scriptures. In like manner,
when Paul says to the Thessalonians, “Quench not the Spirit,” he does
not carry them aloft to empty speculation apart from the word; he
immediately adds, “Despise not prophesying,” (<span
id="iv.i.x-p11.2"></span>[1 Thess.
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020)<span id="iv.i.x-p11.2"></span>.md).
By this, doubtless, he intimates that the light of the Spirit is
quenched the moment prophesying fall into contempt. How is this answered
by those swelling enthusiasts, in whose idea the only true illumination
consists, in carelessly laying aside, and bidding adieu to the Word of
God, while, with no less confidence than folly, they fasten upon any
dreaming notion which may have casually sprung up in their minds? Surely
a very different sobriety becomes the children of God. As they feel that
without the Spirit of God they are utterly devoid of the light of truth,
so they are not ignorant that the word is the instrument by which the
illumination of the Spirit is dispensed. They know of no other Spirit
than the one who dwelt and spake in the apostles—the Spirit by whose
oracles they are daily invited to the hearing of the word.
