### <span id="iv.iv.i-p0.1"></span>ARGUMENT.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p1"></span>In the former Books an exposition has been
given of the three parts of the Apostles’ Creed concerning God the
Creator, the Redeemer, and the Sanctifier. It now remains to treat, in
this last Book, of the Church and the Communion of Saints, or of the
external means or helps by which God invites us to fellowship with
Christ, and keeps us in it.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p2"></span>The twenty Chapters of which it consists
may be conveniently reduced to three particular heads—viz. I. Of the
Church. II. Of the Sacraments. III. Of Civil Government.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p3"></span>The first head occupies the first thirteen
chapters; but these may all be reduced to four—viz. I. Of the marks of
the Church, or the means by which the Church may be discerned, since it
is necessary to cultivate unity with the Church. This is considered in
Chapters 1 and 2—II. Of the rule or government of the Church. The order
of government, Chap. 3. The form in use in the primitive Church, Chap.
4. The form at present existing in the Papacy, Chap. 5. The primacy of
the Pope, Chap. 6. The gradual rise of his usurpation, Chap. 7—III. Of
the power of the Church. The power in relation to doctrine as possessed
either by individuals, Chap. 8; or universally as in Councils, Chap. 9.
The power of enacting laws, Chap. 10. The extent of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, Chap. 11—IV. Of the discipline of the Church. The chief
use of discipline, Chap. 12. The abuse of it, Chap. 13.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p4"></span>The second general head, Of the Sacraments,
comprehends three particulars,—I. Of the Sacraments in general, Chap.
14—II. Of the two Sacraments in particular. Of Baptism, Chap. 15. Of
Pædobaptism, Chap. 16. Of the Lord’s Supper, Chap. 17. Of profaning the
Lord’s Supper, Chap. 18. Of the five Sacraments falsely so called, Chap.
19.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p5"></span>The third general head, Of Civil
Government. This considered first generally, and then under the separate
heads of Magistrates, Laws, and People.
