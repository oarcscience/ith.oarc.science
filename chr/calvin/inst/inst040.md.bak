### <span id="iv.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 6.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p1"></span>REDEMPTION FOR MAN LOST TO BE SOUGHT IN
CHRIST.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p2"></span>The parts of this chapter are, I. The
excellence of the doctrine of Christ the Redeemer—a doctrine always
entertained by the Church, sec. 1. II. Christ, the Mediator in both
dispensations, was offered to the faith of the pious Israelites and
people of old, as is plain from the institution of sacrifice, the
calling of Abraham’s family, and the elevation of David and his
posterity, sec. 2. III. Hence the consolation, strength, hope, and
confidence of the godly under the Law, Christ being offered to them in
various ways by their heavenly Father.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p3"></span>*Sections.*

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p4"></span>1. The knowledge of God the Creator of no
avail without faith in Christ the Redeemer. First reason. Second reason
strengthened by the testimony of an Apostle. Conclusion. This doctrine
entertained by the children of God in all ages from the beginning of the
world. Error of throwing open heaven to the heathen, who know nothing of
Christ. The pretexts for this refuted by passages of Scripture.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p5"></span>2. God never was propitious to the
ancient Israelites without Christ the Mediator. First reason founded on
the institution of sacrifice. Second reason founded on the calling of
Abraham. Third reason founded on the elevation of David’s family to
regal dignity, and confirmed by striking passages of Scripture.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p6"></span>3. Christ the solace ever promised to the
afflicted; the banner of faith and hope always erected. This confirmed
by various passages of Scripture.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p7"></span>4. The Jews taught to have respect to
Christ. This teaching sanctioned by our Saviour himself. The common
saying, that God is the object of faith, requires to be explained and
modified. Conclusion of this discussion concerning Christ. No saving
knowledge of God in the heathen.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p8"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p9"></span>1. The whole human race having been
undone in the person of Adam, the excellence and dignity of our origin,
as already described, is so far from availing us, that it rather turns
to our greater disgrace, until God, who does not acknowledge man when
defiled and corrupted by sin as his own work, appear as a Redeemer in
the person of his only begotten Son. Since our fall from life unto
death, all that knowledge of God the Creator, of which we have
discoursed, would be useless, were it not followed up by faith, holding
forth God to us as a Father in Christ. The natural course undoubtedly
was, that the fabric of the world should be a school in which we might
learn piety, and from it pass to eternal life and perfect felicity. But
after looking at the perfection beheld wherever we turn our eye, above
and below, we are met by the divine malediction, which, while it
involves innocent creatures in our fault, of necessity fills our own
souls with despair. For although God is still pleased in many ways to
manifest his paternal favour towards us, we cannot, from a mere survey
of the world, infer that he is a Father. Conscience urging us within,
and showing that sin is a just ground for our being forsaken, will not
allow us to think that God accounts or treats us as sons. In addition to
this are our sloth and ingratitude. Our minds are so blinded that they
cannot perceive the truth, and all our senses are so corrupt that we
wickedly rob God of his glory. Wherefore, we must conclude with Paul,
“After that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it
pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe,”
(<span id="iv.ii.vii-p9.1"></span>[1 Cor.
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p9.1"></span>). By the “wisdom of God,” he designates this
magnificent theatre of heaven and earth replenished with numberless
wonders, the wise contemplation of which should have enabled us to know
God. But this we do with little profit; and, therefore, he invites us to
faith in Christ,—faith which, by a semblance of foolishness, disgusts
the unbeliever. Therefore, although the preaching of the cross is not in
accordance with human wisdom, we must, however, humbly embrace it if we
would return to God our Maker, from whom we are estranged, that he may
again become our Father. It is certain that after the fall of our first
parent, no knowledge of God without a Mediator was effectual to
salvation. Christ speaks not of his own age merely, but embraces all
ages, when he says “This is life eternal that they might know thee the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p9.2"></span>[John
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p9.2"></span>). The more shameful therefore is the
presumption of those who throw heaven open to the unbelieving and
profane, in the absence of that grace which Scripture uniformly
describes as the only door by which we enter into life. Should any
confine our Saviour’s words to the period subsequent to the promulgation
of the Gospel, the refutation is at hand; since on a ground common to
all ages and nations, it is declared, that those who are estranged from
God, and as such, are under the curse, the children of wrath, cannot be
pleasing to God until they are reconciled. To this we may add the answer
which our Saviour gave to the Samaritan woman “Ye worship ye know not
what; we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p9.3"></span>[John
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p9.3"></span>). By these words, he both charges every
Gentile religion with falsehood, and assigns the reason—viz. that under
the Law the Redeemer was promised to the chosen people only, and that,
consequently, no worship was ever pleasing to God in which respect was
not had to Christ. Hence also Paul affirms, that all the Gentiles were
“without God,” and deprived of the hope of life. Now, since John teaches
that there was life in Christ from the beginning, and that the whole
world had lost it (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p9.4"></span>[John
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)<span id="iv.ii.vii-p9.4"></span>.md),
it is necessary to return to that fountain; And, accordingly, Christ
declares that inasmuch as he is a propitiator, he is life. And, indeed,
the inheritance of heaven belongs to none but the sons of God (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p9.5"></span>[John
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p9.5"></span>). Now, it were most incongruous to give the
place and rank of sons to any who have not been engrafted into the body
of the only begotten Son. And John distinctly testifies that those
become the sons of God who believe in his name. But as it is not my
intention at present formally to discuss the subject of faith in Christ,
it is enough to have thus touched on it in passing.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10"></span>2. Hence it is that God never showed
himself propitious to his ancient people, nor gave them any hope of
grace without a Mediator. I say nothing of the sacrifices of the Law, by
which believers were plainly and openly taught that salvation was not to
be found anywhere but in the expiation which Christ alone completed. All
I maintain is that the prosperous and happy state of the Church was
always founded in the person of Christ. For although God embraced the
whole posterity of Abraham in his covenant, yet Paul properly argues
(<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10.1"></span>[Gal.
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.1"></span>), that Christ was truly the seed in which
all the nations of the earth were to be blessed, since we know that all
who were born of Abraham, according to the flesh, were not accounted the
seed. To omit Ishmael and others, how came it that of the two sons of
Isaac, the twin brothers, Esau and Jacob, while yet in the womb, the one
was chosen and the other rejected? Nay, how came it that the first-born
was rejected, and the younger alone admitted? Moreover, how happens it
that the majority are rejected? It is plain, therefore, that the seed of
Abraham is considered chiefly in one head, and that the promised
salvation is not attained without coming to Christ, whose office it is
to gather together those which were scattered abroad. Thus the primary
adoption of the chosen people depended on the grace of the Mediator.
Although it is not expressed in very distinct terms in Moses, it,
however, appears to have been commonly known to all the godly. For
before a king was appointed over the Israelites, Hannah, the mother of
Samuel, describing the happiness of the righteous, speaks thus in her
song, “He shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his
anointed;” meaning by these words, that God would bless his Church. To
this corresponds the prediction, which is afterwards added, “I will
raise me up a faithful priest, and he shall walk before mine anointed
for ever,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10.2"></span>[1 Sam.
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.2"></span>). And there can be no doubt that our
heavenly Father intended that a living image of Christ should be seen in
David and his posterity. Accordingly, exhorting the righteous to fear
Him, he bids them “Kiss the Son,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.3"></span>[Psalm
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.3"></span>). Corresponding to this is the passage in
the Gospel, “He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father,”
(<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10.4"></span>[John
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.4"></span>). Therefore, though the kingdom was broken
up by the revolt of the ten tribes, yet the covenant which God had made
in David and his successors behaved to stand, as is also declared by his
Prophets, “Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand:
but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my
servant’s sake,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10.5"></span>[1 Kings
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.5"></span>). The same thing is repeated a second and
third time. It is also expressly said, “I will for this afflict the seed
of David, but not for ever,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10.6"></span>[1 Kings
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.6"></span>). Some time afterwards it was said,
“Nevertheless, for David’s sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp in
Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem,”
(<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10.7"></span>[1 Kings
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.7"></span>). And when matters were bordering on
destruction, it was again said, “Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah
for David his servant’s sake, as he had promised to give him alway a
light, and to his children,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10.8"></span>[2 Kings
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p10.8"></span>).

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p11"></span>The sum of the whole comes to
this—David, all others being excluded, was chosen to be the person in
whom the good pleasure of the Lord should dwell; as it is said
elsewhere, “He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh;” “Moreover, he refused
the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;” “But
chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved;” “He chose
David also his servant, and took him from the sheep folds: from
following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his
people, and Israel his inheritance,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p11.1"></span>[Ps.
78:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060.md),
[67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067.md),
[70](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070.md),
[71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#071.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p11.1"></span>). In fine, God, in thus preserving his
Church, intended that its security and salvation should depend on Christ
as its head. Accordingly, David exclaims, “The Lord is their strength,
and he is the saving strength of his anointed;” and then prays “Save thy
people, and bless thine inheritance;” intimating, that the safety of the
Church was indissolubly connected with the government of Christ. In the
same sense he elsewhere says, “Save, Lord: let the king hear us when we
call,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p11.2"></span>[Ps.
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p11.2"></span>). These words plainly teach that believers,
in applying for the help of God, had their sole confidence in this—that
they were under the unseen government of the King. This may be inferred
from another psalm, “Save now, I beseech thee O Lord: Blessed be he that
cometh in the name of the Lord,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p11.3"></span>[Ps.
118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p11.3"></span>). Here it is obvious that believers are
invited to Christ, in the assurance that they will be safe when entirely
in his hand. To the same effect is another prayer, in which the whole
Church implores the divine mercy “Let thy hand be upon the Man of thy
right hand, upon the Son of man, whom thou madest strong (or best
fitted) for thyself,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p11.4"></span>[Ps.
80:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p11.4"></span>). For though the author of the psalm
laments the dispersion of the whole nations he prays for its revival in
him who is sole Head. After the people were led away into captivity, the
land laid waste, and matters to appearance desperate, Jeremiah,
lamenting the calamity of the Church, especially complains, that by the
destruction of the kingdom the hope of believers was cut off; “The
breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in their
pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the
heathen,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p11.5"></span>[Lam.
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p11.5"></span>). From all this it is abundantly plain,
that as the Lord cannot be propitious to the human race without a
Mediator, Christ was always held forth to the holy Fathers under the Law
as the object of their faith.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12"></span>3. Moreover when comfort is promised in
affliction, especially when the deliverance of the Church is described,
the banner of faith and hope in Christ is unfurled. “Thou wentest forth
for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine
anointed,” says Habakkuk (3:13). And whenever mention is made in the
Prophets of the renovation of the Church, the people are directed to the
promise made to David, that his kingdom would be for ever. And there is
nothing strange in this, since otherwise there would have been no
stability in the covenant. To this purpose is the remarkable prophecy in
<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12.1"></span>[Isaiah
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.1"></span>. After seeing that the unbelieving king
Ahab repudiated what he had testified regarding the deliverance of
Jerusalem from siege and its immediate safety, he passes as it were
abruptly to the Messiah, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a
son, and shall call his name Emmanuel;” intimating indirectly, that
though the king and his people wickedly rejected the promise offered to
them, as if they were bent on causing the faith of God to fail, the
covenant would not be defeated—the Redeemer would come in his own time.
In fine, all the prophets, to show that God was placable, were always
careful to bring forward that kingdom of David, on which redemption and
eternal salvation depended. Thus in Isaiah it is said, “I will make an
everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I
have given him for a witness to the people,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.2"></span>[Isa.
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004)<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12.2"></span>.md);
intimating, that believers, in calamitous circumstances, could have no
hope, had they not this testimony that God would be ready to hear them.
In the same way, to revive their drooping spirits, Jeremiah says,
“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a
righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and
Israel shall dwell safely,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12.3"></span>[Jer.
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12.3"></span>.md).
In Ezekiel also it is said, “I will set up one Shepherd over them, and
he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he
shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my
servant David a prince among them: I the Lord have spoken it. And I will
make with them a covenant of peace,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.4"></span>[Ezek.
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.4"></span>). And again, after discoursing of this
wondrous renovation, he says, “David my servant shall be king over them:
and they all shall have one shepherd.” “Moreover, I will make a covenant
of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them,”
(<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12.5"></span>[Ezek.
37:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.5"></span>). I select a few passages out of many,
because I merely wish to impress my readers with the fact, that the hope
of believers was ever treasured up in Christ alone. All the other
prophets concur in this. Thus Hosea, “Then shall the children of Judah
and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves
one head,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12.6"></span>[Hosea
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.6"></span>). This he afterwards explains in clearer
terms, “Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord
their God, and David their king,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.7"></span>[Hosea
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.7"></span>). Micas, also speaking of the return of the
people, says expressly, “Their king shall pass before them, and the Lord
on the head of them,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12.8"></span>[Micah
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.8"></span>). So Amos, in predicting the renovation of
the people, says “In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David
that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up
the ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.9"></span>[Amos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.9"></span>); in other words, the only banner of
salvation was, the exaltation of the family of David to regal splendour,
as fulfilled in Christ. Hence, too, Zechariah, as nearer in time to the
manifestation of Christ, speaks more plainly, “Rejoice greatly, O
daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King
cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.10"></span>[Zech.
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p12.10"></span>). This corresponds to the passage already
quoted from the Psalms, “The Lord is their strength, and he is the
saving health of their anointed.” Here salvation is extended from the
head to the whole body.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p13"></span>4. By familiarising the Jews with these
prophecies, God intended to teach them, that in seeking for deliverance,
they should turn their eyes directly towards Christ. And though they had
sadly degenerated, they never entirely lost the knowledge of this
general principle, that God, by the hand of Christ, would be the
deliverer of the Church, as he had promised to David; and that in this
way only the free covenant by which God had adopted his chosen people
would be fulfilled. Hence it was, that on our Saviour’s entry into
Jerusalem, shortly before his death, the children shouted, “Hosannah to
the son of David,” (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p13.1"></span>[Mt.
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p13.1"></span>). For there seems to have been a hymn known
to all, and in general use, in which they sung that the only remaining
pledge which they had of the divine mercy was the promised advent of a
Redeemer. For this reason, Christ tells his disciples to believe in him,
in order that they might have a distinct and complete belief in God, “Ye
believe in God, believe also in me,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p13.2"></span>[John
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p13.2"></span>). For although, properly speaking, faith
rises from Christ to the Father, he intimates, that even when it leans
on God, it gradually vanishes away, unless he himself interpose to give
it solid strength. The majesty of God is too high to be scaled up to by
mortals, who creep like worms on the earth. Therefore, the common saying
that God is the object of faith (Lactantius, lib. 4 c. 16), requires to
be received with some modification. When Christ is called the image of
the invisible God (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p13.3"></span>[Col.
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p13.3"></span>), the expression is not used without cause,
but is designed to remind us that we can have no knowledge of our
salvation, until we behold God in Christ. For although the Jewish
scribes had by their false glosses darkened what the Prophets had taught
concerning the Redeemer, yet Christ assumed it to be a fact, received,
as it were, with public consent, that there was no other remedy in
desperate circumstances, no other mode of delivering the Church than the
manifestation of the Mediator. It is true, that the fact adverted to by
Paul was not so generally known as it ought to have been—viz. that
Christ is the end of the Law (<span id="iv.ii.vii-p13.4"></span>[Rom.
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p13.4"></span>), though this is both true, and clearly
appears both from the Law and the Prophets. I am not now, however,
treating of faith, as we shall elsewhere have a fitter place (Book 3
Chap. 2), but what I wish to impress upon my readers in this way is,
that the first step in piety is, to acknowledge that God is a Father, to
defend, govern, and cherish us, until he brings us to the eternal
inheritance of his kingdom; that hence it is plain, as we lately
observed, there is no saving knowledge of God without Christ, and that,
consequently, from the beginning of the world Christ was held forth to
all the elect as the object of their faith and confidence. In this
sense, Irenæus says, that the Father, who is boundless in himself, is
bounded in the Son, because he has accommodated himself to our capacity,
lest our minds should be swallowed up by the immensity of his glory
(Irenaeus, lib. 4 cap. 8). Fanatics, not attending to this, distort a
useful sentiment into an impious dream,18  <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) as if Christ had only a share of the
Godhead, as a part taken from a whole; whereas the meaning merely is,
that God is comprehended in Christ alone. The saying of John was always
true, “whosoever denieth the Son, the same has not the Father,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p14.1"></span>[1 John
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p14.1"></span>). For though in old time there were many
who boasted that they worshipped the Supreme Deity, the Maker of heaven
and earth, yet as they had no Mediator, it was impossible for them truly
to enjoy the mercy of God, so as to feel persuaded that he was their
Father. Not holding the head, that is, Christ, their knowledge of God
was evanescent; and hence they at length fell away to gross and foul
superstitions betraying their ignorance, just as the Turks in the
present day, who, though proclaiming, with full throat, that the Creator
of heaven and earth is their God, yet by their rejection of Christ,
substitute an idol in his place.
