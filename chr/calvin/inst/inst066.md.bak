### <span id="iv.iii.xiv-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 13.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p1"></span>TWO THINGS TO BE OBSERVED IN GRATUITOUS
JUSTIFICATION.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p2"></span>The divisions of this chapter are,—I.
The glory of God, and peace of conscience, both secured by gratuitous
justification. An insult to the glory of God to glory in ourselves and
seek justification out of Christ, whose righteousness, apprehended by
faith, is imputed to all the elect for reconciliation and eternal
salvation, sec. 1, 2. II. Peace of conscience cannot be obtained in any
other way than by gratuitous justification. This fully proved, sec. 3-5.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p3"></span>*Sections*.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p4"></span>1. The glory of God remains untarnished,
when he alone is acknowledged to be just. This proved from Scripture.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p5"></span>2. Those who glory in themselves glory
against God. Objection. Answer, confirmed by the authority of Paul and
Peter.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p6"></span>3. Peace of conscience obtained by free
justification only. Testimony of Solomon, of conscience itself, and the
Apostle Paul, who contends that faith is made vain if righteousness come
by the law.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p7"></span>4. The promise confirmed by faith in the
mercy of Christ. This is confirmed by Augustine and Bernard, is in
accordance with what has been above stated, and is illustrated by clear
predictions of the prophets.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p8"></span>5. Farther demonstration by an Apostle.
Refutation of a sophism.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p9"></span>1. Here two ends must be kept specially
in view, namely, that the glory of God be maintained unimpaired, and
that our consciences, in the view of his tribunal, be secured in
peaceful rest and calm tranquillity. When the question relates to
righteousness, we see how often and how anxiously Scripture exhorts us
to give the whole praise of it to God. Accordingly, the Apostle
testifies that the purpose of the Lord in conferring righteousness upon
us in Christ, was to demonstrate his own righteousness. The nature of
this demonstration he immediately subjoins—viz. “that he might be just,
and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.1"></span>[Rom.
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.1"></span>). Observe, that the righteousness of God is
not sufficiently displayed, unless He alone is held to be righteous, and
freely communicates righteousness to the undeserving. For this reason it
is his will, that “every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
become guilty before God,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.2"></span>[Rom.
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.2"></span>). For so long as a man has any thing,
however small, to say in his own defense, so long he deducts somewhat
from the glory of God. Thus we are taught in Ezekiel how much we glorify
his name by acknowledging our iniquity: “Then shall ye remember your
ways and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall
loathe yourselves in your own sight, for all your evils that ye have
committed. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought
with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor
according to your corrupt doings,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.3"></span>[Ezek.
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043.md),
[44](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#044.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.3"></span>). If part of the true knowledge of God
consists in being oppressed by a consciousness of our own iniquity, and
in recognizing him as doing good to those who are unworthy of it, why do
we attempt, to our great injury, to steal from the Lord even one
particle of the praise of unmerited kindness? In like manner, when
Jeremiah exclaims, “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither
let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his
riches: but let him that glorieth glory” in the Lord (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.4"></span>[Jer.
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.4"></span>), does he not intimate, that the glory of
the Lord is infringed when man glories in himself? To this purpose,
indeed, Paul accommodates the words when he says, that all the parts of
our salvation are treasured up with Christ, that we may glory only in
the Lord (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.5"></span>[1 Cor.
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.5"></span>). For he intimates, that whosoever imagines
he has any thing of his own, rebels against God, and obscures his glory.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p10"></span>2. Thus, indeed, it is: we never truly
glory in him until we have utterly discarded our own glory. It must,
therefore, be regarded as an universal proposition, that whoso glories
in himself glories against God. Paul indeed considers, that the whole
world is not made subject to God until every ground of glorying has been
withdrawn from men (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.1"></span>[Rom.
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.1"></span>). Accordingly, Isaiah, when he declares
that “in the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified” adds, “and
shall glory” (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.2"></span>[Isa.
45:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.2"></span> ), as if he had said that the elect are
justified by the Lord, in order that they may glory in him, and in none
else. The way in which we are to glory in the Lord he had explained in
the preceding verse, “Unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall
swear;” “Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and
strength, even to him shall men come.” Observe, that the thing required
is not simple confession, but confession confirmed by an oath, that it
might not be imagined that any kind of fictitious humility might
suffice. And let no man here allege that he does not glory, when without
arrogance he recognizes his own righteousness; such a recognition cannot
take place without generating confidence, nor such confidence without
begetting boasting. Let us remember, therefore, that in the whole
discussion concerning justification the great thing to be attended to
is, that God’s glory be maintained entire and unimpaired; since as the
Apostle declares, it was in demonstration of his own righteousness that
he shed his favor upon us; it was “that he might be just, and the
justifier of him which believeth in Jesus,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.3"></span>[Rom.
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.3"></span>). Hence, in another passage, having said
that the Lord conferred salvation upon us, in order that he might show
forth the glory of his name (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.4"></span>[Eph.
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.4"></span>), he afterwards, as if repeating the same
thing, adds, “By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should
boast,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.5"></span>[Eph.
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.5"></span>). And Peter, when he reminds us that we
are called to the hope of salvation, “that ye should show forth the
praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous
light,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.6"></span>[1 Pet.
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p10.6"></span>), doubtless intends thus to proclaim in
the ears of believers only the praises of God, that they may bury in
profound silence all arrogance of the flesh. The sum is, that man cannot
claim a single particle of righteousness to himself, without at the same
time detracting from the glory of the divine righteousness.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p11"></span>3. If we now inquire in what way the
conscience can be quieted as in the view of God, we shall find that the
only way is by having righteousness bestowed upon us freely by the gift
of God. Let us always remember the words of Solomon, “Who can say I have
made my heart clean, I am free from my sin?” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p11.1"></span>[Prov.
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p11.1"></span>). Undoubtedly there is not one man who is
not covered with infinite pollutions. Let the most perfect man descend
into his own conscience, and bring his actions to account, and what will
the result be? Will he feel calm and quiescent, as if all matters were
well arranged between himself and God; or will he not rather be stung
with dire torment, when he sees that the ground of condemnation is
within him if he be estimated by his works? Conscience, when it beholds
God, must either have sure peace with his justice, or be beset by the
terrors of hell. We gain nothing, therefore, by discoursing of
righteousness, unless we hold it to be a righteousness stable enough to
support our souls before the tribunal of God. When the soul is able to
appear intrepidly in the presence of God, and receive his sentence
without dismay, then only let us know that we have found a righteousness
that is not fictitious. It is not, therefore, without cause, that the
Apostle insists on this matter. I prefer giving it in his words rather
than my own: “If they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
and the promise made of no effect,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p11.2"></span>[Rom.
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p11.2"></span>). He first infers that faith is made void
if the promise of righteousness has respect to the merit of our works,
or depends on the observance of the law. Never could any one rest
securely in it, for never could he feel fully assured that he had fully
satisfied the law; and it is certain that no man ever fully satisfied it
by works. Not to go far for proof of this, every one who will use his
eyes aright may be his own witness. Hence it appears how deep and dark
the abyss is into which hypocrisy plunges the minds of men, when they
indulge so securely as, without hesitations to oppose their flattery to
the judgment of God, as if they were relieving him from his office as
judge. Very different is the anxiety which fills the breasts of
believers, who sincerely examine themselves.42  <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) Every mind, therefore, would first
begin to hesitate, and at length to despair, while each determined for
itself with how great a load of debt it was still oppressed, and how far
it was from coming up to the enjoined condition. Thus, then, faith would
be oppressed and extinguished. To have faith is not to fluctuate, to
vary, to be carried up and down, to hesitate, remain in suspense,
vacillate, in fine, to despair; it is to possess sure certainty and
complete security of mind, to have whereon to rest and fix your foot.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p13"></span>4. Paul, moreover, adds, that the
promise itself would be rendered null and void. For if its fulfillment
depends on our merits when pray, will we be able to come the length of
meriting the favor of God? Nay, the second clause is a consequence of
the former, since the promise will not be fulfilled unless to those who
put faith in it. Faith therefore failing, no power will remain in the
promise. “Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the
end the promise might be sure to all the seed,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.1"></span>[Rom.
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.1"></span>). It was abundantly confirmed when made to
rest on the mercy of God alone, for mercy and truth are united by an
indissoluble tie; that is, whatever God has mercifully promised he
faithfully performs. Thus David, before he asks salvation according to
the word of God, first places the source of it in his mercy. “Let, I
pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy
word unto thy servant,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.2"></span>[Ps.
119:76](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#076.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.2"></span>). And justly, for nothing but mere mercy
induces God to promise. Here, then, we must place, and, as it were,
firmly fix our whole hope, paying no respect to our works, and asking no
assistance from them. And lest you should suppose that there is any
thing novel in what I say, Augustine also enjoins us so to act.
“Christ,” says he, “will reign forever among his servants. This God has
promised, God has spoken; if this is not enough, God has sworn.
Therefore, as the promise stands firm, not in respect of our merits, but
in respect of his mercy, no one ought to tremble in announcing that of
which he cannot doubt,” (August. in <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.3"></span>[Ps.
88](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.3"></span>,
Tract. 50). Thus Bernard also, “Who can be saved? ask the disciples of
Christ. He replies, With men it is impossible, but not with God. This is
our whole confidence, this our only consolation; this the whole ground
of our hope: but being assured of the possibility, what are we to say as
to his willingness? Who knows whether he is deserving of love or hatred?
(<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.4"></span>[Eccles.
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.4"></span>). ‘Who has known the mind of the Lord that
he may instruct him?’ (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.5"></span>[1 Cor.
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.5"></span>). Here it is plain, faith must come to our
aid: here we must have the assistance of truth, in order that the secret
purpose of the Father respecting us may be revealed by the Spirit, and
the Spirit testifying may persuade our hearts that we are the sons of
God. But let him persuade by calling and justifying freely by faith: in
these there is a kind of transition from eternal predestination to
future glory,” (Bert. in Dedica. Templi, Serm. 5). Let us thus briefly
conclude: Scripture indicates that the promises of God are not surer
unless they are apprehended with full assurance of conscience; it
declares that wherever there is doubt or uncertainty, the promises are
made void; on the other hand, that they can only waver and fluctuate if
they depend on our works. Therefore, either our righteousness must
perish, or without any consideration of our works, place must be given
to faith alone, whose nature it is to prick up the ear, and shut the
eye; that is, to be intent on the promise only, to give up all idea of
any dignity or merit in man. Thus is fulfilled the celebrated prophecy
of Zechariah: “I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. In
that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbor
under the vine, and under the fig-tree,” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.6"></span>[Zech.
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.6"></span>). Here the prophet intimates that the only
way in which believers can enjoy true peace, is by obtaining the
remission of their sins. For we must attend to this peculiarity in the
prophets, that when they discourse of the kingdom of Christ, they set
forth the external mercies of God as types of spiritual blessings. Hence
Christ is called *the Prince of Peace, and our peace*, <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.7"></span>[Isaiah
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.7"></span>; <span id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.8"></span>[Eph.
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p13.8"></span>), because he calms all the agitations of
conscience. If the method is asked, we must come to the sacrifice by
which God was appeased, for no man will ever cease to tremble, until he
hold that God is propitiated solely by that expiation in which Christ
endured his anger. In short, peace must be sought nowhere but in the
agonies of Christ our Redeemer.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p14"></span>5. But why employ a more obscure
testimony? Paul uniformly declares that the conscience can have no peace
or quiet joy until it is held for certain that we are justified by
faith. And he at the same time declares whence this certainty is
derived—viz. when “the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.1"></span>[Rom.
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.1"></span>); as if he had said that our Souls cannot
have peace until we are fully assured that we are pleasing to God. Hence
he elsewhere exclaims in the person of believers in general, “Who shall
separate us from the love of Christ?” (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.2"></span>[Rom.
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.2"></span>). Until we have reached that haven, the
slightest breeze will make us tremble, but so long as the Lord is our
Shepherd, we shall walk without fear in the valley of the shadow of
death (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.3"></span>[Ps.
23](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.3"></span>). Thus those who pretend that
justification by faith consists in being regenerated and made just, by
living spiritually, have never tasted the sweetness of grace in trusting
that God will be propitious. Hence also, they know no more of praying
aright than do the Turks or any other heathen people. For, as Paul
declares, faith is not true, unless it suggest and dictate the
delightful name of Father; nay, unless it open our mouths and enable us
freely to cry, Abba, Father. This he expresses more clearly in another
passage, “In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the
faith of him,” (<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.4"></span>[Eph.
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.4"></span>). This, certainly, is not obtained by the
gift of regeneration, which, as it is always defective in the present
state, contains within it many grounds of doubt. Wherefore, we must have
recourse to this remedy; we must hold that the only hope which believers
have of the heavenly inheritance is, that being in grafted into the body
of Christ, they are justified freely. For, in regard to justification,
faith is merely passives bringing nothing of our own to procure the
favor of God, but receiving from Christ every thing that we want.
