### <span id="iv.i.xix-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER 18.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p1"></span>THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE WICKED EMPLOYED
BY GOD, WHILE HE CONTINUES FREE FROM EVERY TAINT.14  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md)

<span id="iv.i.xix-p3"></span>This last chapter of the First Book
consists of three parts: I. It having been said above that God bends all
the reprobate, and even Satan himself, at his will, three objections are
started. First, that this happens by the permission, not by the will of
God. To this objection there is a twofold reply, the one, that angels
and men, good and bad, do nothing but what is appointed by God; the
second, that all movements are secretly directed to their end by the
hidden inspiration of God, sec. 1, 2. II. A second objection is, that
there are two contrary wills in God, if by a secret counsel he decrees
what he openly prohibits by his law. This objection refuted, sec. 3.
III. The third objection is, that God is made the author of all
wickedness, when he is said not only to use the agency of the wicked,
but also to govern their counsels and affections, and that therefore the
wicked are unjustly punished. This objection refuted in the last
section.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p4"></span>*Sections.*

<span id="iv.i.xix-p5"></span>1. The carnal mind the source of the
objections which are raised against the Providence of God. A primary
objection, making a distinction between the *permission* and the *will*
of God, refuted. Angels and men, good and bad, do nought but what has
been decreed by God. This proved by examples.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p6"></span>2. All hidden movements directed to their
end by the unseen but righteous instigation of God. Examples, with
answers to objections.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p7"></span>3. These objections originate in a spirit
of pride and blasphemy. Objection, that there must be two contrary wills
in God, refuted. Why the one simple will of God seems to us as if it
were manifold.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p8"></span>4. Objection, that God is the author of
sin, refuted by examples. Augustine’s answer and admonition.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p9"></span>1. From other passages, in which God is
said to draw or bend Satan himself, and all the reprobate, to his will,
a more difficult question arises. For the carnal mind can scarcely
comprehend how, when acting by their means, he contracts no taint from
their impurity, nay, how, in a common operation, he is exempt from all
guilt, and can justly condemn his own ministers. Hence a distinction has
been invented between *doing* and *permitting* because to many it seemed
altogether inexplicable how Satan and all the wicked are so under the
hand and authority of God, that he directs their malice to whatever end
he pleases, and employs their iniquities to execute his Judgments. The
modesty of those who are thus alarmed at the appearance of absurdity
might perhaps be excused, did they not endeavour to vindicate the
justice of God from every semblance of stigma by defending an untruth.
It seems absurd that man should be blinded by the will and command of
God, and yet be forthwith punished for his blindness. Hence, recourse is
had to the evasion that this is done only by the permission, and not
also by the will of God. He himself, however, openly declaring that he
*does* this, repudiates the evasion. That men do nothing save at the
secret instigation of God, and do not discuss and deliberate on any
thing but what he has previously decreed with himself and brings to pass
by his secret direction, is proved by numberless clear passages of
Scripture. What we formerly quoted from the Psalms, to the effect that
he does whatever pleases him, certainly extends to all the actions of
men. If God is the arbiter of peace and war, as is there said, and that
without any exception, who will venture to say that men are borne along
at random with a blind impulse, while He is unconscious or quiescent?
But the matter will be made clearer by special examples. From the first
chapter of Job we learn that Satan appears in the presence of God to
receive his orders, just as do the angels who obey spontaneously. The
manner and the end are different, but still the fact is, that he cannot
attempt anything without the will of God. But though afterwards his
power to afflict the saint seems to be only a bare permission, yet as
the sentiment is true, “The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; as
it pleased the Lord, so it has been done,” we infer that God was the
author of that trial of which Satan and wicked robbers were merely the
instruments. Satan’s aim is to drive the saint to madness by despair.
The Sabeans cruelly and wickedly make a sudden incursion to rob another
of his goods. Job acknowledges that he was deprived of all his property,
and brought to poverty, because such was the pleasure of God. Therefore,
whatever men or Satan himself devise, God holds the helm, and makes all
their efforts contribute to the execution of his Judgments. God wills
that the perfidious Ahab should be deceived; the devil offers his agency
for that purpose, and is sent with a definite command to be a lying
spirit in the mouth of all the prophets (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p9.1"></span>[2 Kings
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p9.1"></span>). If the blinding and infatuation of Ahab is
a Judgment from God, the fiction of bare permission is at an end; for it
would be ridiculous for a judge only to permit, and not also to decree,
what he wishes to be done at the very time that he commits the execution
of it to his ministers. The Jews purposed to destroy Christ. Pilate and
the soldiers indulged them in their fury; yet the disciples confess in
solemn prayer that all the wicked did nothing but what the hand and
counsel of God had decreed (<span id="iv.i.xix-p9.2"></span>[Acts
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028)<span id="iv.i.xix-p9.2"></span>.md),
just as Peter had previously said in his discourse, that Christ was
delivered to death by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God
(<span id="iv.i.xix-p9.3"></span>[Acts
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023)<span id="iv.i.xix-p9.3"></span>.md);
in other words, that God, to whom all things are known from the
beginning, had determined what the Jews had executed. He repeats the
same thing elsewhere, “Those things, which God before had showed by the
mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so
fulfilled,” (<span id="iv.i.xix-p9.4"></span>[Acts
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018)<span id="iv.i.xix-p9.4"></span>.md).
Absalom incestuously defiling his father’s bed, perpetrates a detestable
crime. God, however, declares that it was his work; for the words are,
“Thou midst it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and
before the sun.”14  <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) The
cruelties of the Chaldeans in Judea are declared by Jeremiah to be the
work of God. For which reason, Nebuchadnezzar is called the servant of
God. God frequently exclaims, that by his hiss, by the clang of his
trumpet, by his authority and command, the wicked are excited to war. He
calls the Assyrian the rod of his anger, and the axe which he wields in
his hand. The overthrow of the city and downfall of the temple, he calls
his own work. David, not murmuring against God, but acknowledging him to
be a just judge, confesses that the curses of Shimei are uttered by his
orders. “The Lord,” says he, “has bidden him curse.” Often in sacred
history whatever happens is said to proceed from the Lord, as the revolt
of the ten tribes, the death of Eli’s sons, and very many others of a
similar description. Those who have a tolerable acquaintance with the
Scriptures see that, with a view to brevity, I am only producing a few
out of many passages, from which it is perfectly clear that it is the
merest trifling to substitute a bare permission for the providence of
God, as if he sat in a watch-tower waiting for fortuitous events, his
Judgments meanwhile depending on the will of man.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p11"></span>2. With regard to secret movements, what
Solomon says of the heart of a king, that it is turned hither and
thither, as God sees meet, certainly applies to the whole human race,
and has the same force as if he had said, that whatever we conceive in
our minds is directed to its end by the secret inspiration of God. And
certainly, did he not work internally in the minds of men, it could not
have been properly said, that he takes away the lip from the true, and
prudence from the aged—takes away the heart from the princes of the
earth, that they wander through devious paths. To the same effect, we
often read that men are intimidated when He fills their hearts with
terror. Thus David left the camp of Saul while none knew of its because
a sleep from God had fallen upon all. But nothing can be clearer than
the many passages which declare, that he blinds the minds of men, and
smites them with giddiness, intoxicates them with a spirit of stupor,
renders them infatuated, and hardens their hearts. Even these
expressions many would confine to permissions as if, by deserting the
reprobate, he allowed them to be blinded by Satan. But since the Holy
Spirit distinctly says, that the blindness and infatuation are inflicted
by the just Judgment of God, the solution is altogether inadmissible. He
is said to have hardened the heart of Pharaoh, to have hardened it yet
more, and confirmed it. Some evade these forms of expression by a silly
cavil, because Pharaoh is elsewhere said to have hardened his own heart,
thus making his will the cause of hardening it; as if the two things did
not perfectly agree with each other, though in different senses—viz.
that man, though acted upon by God, at the same time also acts. But I
retort the objection on those who make it. If to harden means only bare
permission, the contumacy will not properly belong to Pharaoh. Now,
could any thing be more feeble and insipid than to interpret as if
Pharaoh had only allowed himself to be hardened? We may add, that
Scripture cuts off all handle for such cavils: “I,” saith the Lord,
“will harden his heart,” (<span id="iv.i.xix-p11.1"></span>[Exod.
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.1"></span>). So also, Moses says of the inhabitants of
the land of Canaan, that they went forth to battle because the Lord had
hardened their hearts (<span id="iv.i.xix-p11.2"></span>[Josh.
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.2"></span>). The same thing is repeated by another
prophet, “He turned their hearts to hate his people,” (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.3"></span>[Psalm
105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.3"></span>). In like manner, in Isaiah, he says of the
Assyrian, “I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against
the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spoil, and
to take the prey,” (<span id="iv.i.xix-p11.4"></span>[Isaiah
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.4"></span>); not that he intends to teach wicked and
obstinate man to obey spontaneously, but because he bends them to
execute his Judgments, just as if they carried their orders engraven on
their minds. And hence it appears that they are impelled by the sure
appointment of God. I admit, indeed, that God often acts in the
reprobate by interposing the agency of Satan; but in such a manner, that
Satan himself performs his part, just as he is impelled, and succeeds
only in so far as he is permitted. The evil spirit that troubled Saul is
said to be from the Lord (<span id="iv.i.xix-p11.5"></span>[1 Sam.
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.5"></span>), to intimate that Saul’s madness was a just
punishment from God. Satan is also said to blind the minds of those who
believe not (<span id="iv.i.xix-p11.6"></span>[2 Cor.
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)<span id="iv.i.xix-p11.6"></span>.md).
But how so, unless that a spirit of error is sent from God himself,
making those who refuse to obey the truth to believe a lie? According to
the former view, it is said, “If the prophet be deceived when he has
spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet,” (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.7"></span>[Ezek.
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.7"></span>). According to the latter view, he is said
to have given men over to a reprobate mind (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.8"></span>[Rom.
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.8"></span>), because he is the special author of his
own just vengeance; whereas Satan is only his minister (see Calv. in
<span id="iv.i.xix-p11.9"></span>[Ps.
141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p11.9"></span>). But as in the Second Book (Chap. 4 sec. 3,
4), in discussing the question of man’s freedom, this subject will again
be considered, the little that has now been said seems to be all that
the occasion requires. The sum of the whole is this,—since the will of
God is said to be the cause of all things, all the counsels and actions
of men must be held to be governed by his providence; so that he not
only exerts his power in the elect, who are guided by the Holy Spirit,
but also forces the reprobate to do him service.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p12"></span>3. As I have hitherto stated only what is
plainly and unambiguously taught in Scripture, those who hesitate not to
stigmatise what is thus taught by the sacred oracles, had better beware
what kind of censure they employ. If, under a pretence of ignorance,
they seek the praise of modesty, what greater arrogance can be imagined
than to utter one word in opposition to the authority of God—to say, for
instance, “I think otherwise,”—“I would not have this subject touched?”
But if they openly blaspheme, what will they gain by assaulting heaven?
Such petulance, indeed, is not new. In all ages there have been wicked
and profane men, who rabidly assailed this branch of doctrine. But what
the Spirit declared of old by the mouth of David (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p12.1"></span>[Ps.
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p12.1"></span>), they will feel by experience to be
true—God will overcome when he is judged. David indirectly rebukes the
infatuation of those whose license is so unbridled, that from their
grovelling spot of earth they not only plead against God, but arrogate
to themselves the right of censuring him. At the same time, he briefly
intimates that the blasphemies which they belch forth against heaven,
instead of reaching God, only illustrate his justice, when the mists of
their calumnies are dispersed. Even our faith, because founded on the
sacred word of God, is superior to the whole world, and is able from its
height to look down upon such mists.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p13"></span>Their first objection—that if nothing
happens without the will of God, he must have two contrary wills,
decreeing by a secret counsel what he has openly forbidden in his law—is
easily disposed of. But before I reply to it, I would again remind my
readers, that this cavil is directed not against me, but against the
Holy Spirit, who certainly dictated this confession to that holy man
Job, “The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away,” when, after being
plundered by robbers, he acknowledges that their injustice and mischief
was a just chastisement from God. And what says the Scripture elsewhere?
The sons of Eli “hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because
the Lord would slay them,” (<span id="iv.i.xix-p13.1"></span>[1 Sam.
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.1"></span>). Another prophet also exclaims, “Our God is
in the heavens: he has done whatsoever he has pleased,” (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.2"></span>[Ps.
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.2"></span>). I have already shown clearly enough that
God is the author of all those things which, according to these
objectors, happen only by his inactive permission. He testifies that he
creates light and darkness, forms good and evil (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.3"></span>[Is.
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.3"></span>); that no evil happens which he has not done
(<span id="iv.i.xix-p13.4"></span>[Amos
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006)<span id="iv.i.xix-p13.4"></span>.md).
Let them tell me whether God exercises his Judgments willingly or
unwillingly. As Moses teaches that he who is accidentally killed by the
blow of an axe, is delivered by God into the hand of him who smites him
(<span id="iv.i.xix-p13.5"></span>[Deut.
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.5"></span>), so the Gospel, by the mouth of Luke,
declares, that Herod and Pontius Pilate conspired “to do whatsoever thy
hand and thy counsel determined before to be done,” (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.6"></span>[Acts
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.6"></span>). And, in truth, if Christ was not crucified
by the will of God, where is our redemption? Still, however, the will of
God is not at variance with itself. It undergoes no change. He makes no
pretence of not willing what he wills, but while in himself the will is
one and undivided, to us it appears manifold, because, from the
feebleness of our intellect, we cannot comprehend how, though after a
different manner, he wills and wills not the very same thing. Paul terms
the calling of the Gentiles a hidden mystery, and shortly after adds,
that therein was manifested the manifold wisdom of God (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.7"></span>[Eph.
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.7"></span>). Since, on account of the dullness of our
sense, the wisdom of God seems manifold (or, as an old interpreter
rendered it, multiform), are we, therefore, to dream of some variation
in God, as if he either changed his counsel, or disagreed with himself?
Nay, when we cannot comprehend how God can will that to be done which he
forbids us to do, let us call to mind our imbecility, and remember that
the light in which he dwells is not without cause termed inaccessible
(<span id="iv.i.xix-p13.8"></span>[1 Tim.
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.8"></span>), because shrouded in darkness. Hence, all
pious and modest men will readily acquiesce in the sentiment of
Augustine: “Man sometimes with a good will wishes something which God
does not will, as when a good son wishes his father to live, while God
wills him to die. Again, it may happen that man with a bad will wishes
what God wills righteously, as when a bad son wishes his father to die,
and God also wills it. The former wishes what God wills not, the latter
wishes what God also wills. And yet the filial affection of the former
is more consonant to the good will of God, though willing differently,
than the unnatural affection of the latter, though willing the same
thing; so much does approbation or condemnation depend on what it is
befitting in man, and what in God to will, and to what end the will of
each has respect. For the things which God rightly wills, he
accomplishes by the evil wills of bad men,”—(*August. Enchirid. ad
Laurent. cap.* 101). He had said a little before (cap. 100), that the
apostate angels, by their revolt, and all the reprobate, as far as they
themselves were concerned, did what God willed not; but, in regard to
his omnipotence, it was impossible for them to do so: for, while they
act against the will of God, his will is accomplished in them. Hence he
exclaims, “Great is the work of God, exquisite in all he wills! so that,
in a manner wondrous and ineffable, that is not done without his will
which is done contrary to it, because it could not be done if he did not
permit; nor does he permit it unwillingly, but willingly; nor would He
who is good permit evil to be done, were he not omnipotent to bring good
out of evil,” (*Augustin. in* <span id="iv.i.xix-p13.9"></span>[Ps.
111:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p13.9"></span>).

<span id="iv.i.xix-p14"></span>4. In the same way is solved, or rather
spontaneously vanishes, another objection—viz. If God not only uses the
agency of the wicked, but also governs their counsels and affections, he
is the author of all their sins; and, therefore, men, in executing what
God has decreed, are unjustly condemned, because they are obeying his
will. Here *will* is improperly confounded with *precept*, though it is
obvious, from innumerable examples, that there is the greatest
difference between them.14  <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) When
Absalom defiled his father’s bed, though God was pleased thus to avenge
the adultery of David, he did not therefore enjoin an abandoned son to
commit incest, unless, perhaps, in respect of David, as David himself
says of Shimei’s curses. For, while he confesses that Shimei acts by the
order of God, he by no means commends the obedience, as if that petulant
dog had been yielding obedience to a divine command; but, recognising in
his tongue the scourge of God, he submits patiently to be chastised.
Thus we must hold, that while by means of the wicked God performs what
he had secretly decreed, they are not excusable as if they were obeying
his precept, which of set purpose they violate according to their lust.

<span id="iv.i.xix-p16"></span>How these things, which men do
perversely, are of God, and are ruled by his secret providence, is
strikingly shown in the election of King Jeroboam (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p16.1"></span>[1 Kings
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p16.1"></span>), in which the rashness and infatuation of
the people are severely condemned for perverting the order sanctioned by
God, and perfidiously revolting from the family of David. And yet we
know it was God’s will that Jeroboam should be anointed. Hence the
apparent contradiction in the words of Hosea (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p16.2"></span>[Hosea
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.i.xix-p16.2"></span>;
13:11), because, while God complained that that kingdom was erected
without his knowledge, and against his will, he elsewhere declares, that
he had given King Jeroboam in his anger. How shall we reconcile the two
things,—that Jeroboam’s reign was not of God, and yet God appointed him
king? In this way: The people could not revolt from the family of David
without shaking off a yoke divinely imposed on them, and yet God himself
was not deprived of the power of thus punishing the ingratitude of
Solomon. We, therefore, see how God, while not willing treachery, with
another view justly wills the revolt; and hence Jeroboam, by
unexpectedly receiving the sacred unction, is urged to aspire to the
kingdom. For this reason, the sacred history says, that God stirred up
an enemy to deprive the son of Solomon of part of the kingdom (<span
id="iv.i.xix-p16.3"></span>[1 Kings
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p16.3"></span>). Let the reader diligently ponder both
points: how, as it was the will of God that the people should be ruled
by the hand of one king, their being rent into two parties was contrary
to his will; and yet how this same will originated the revolt. For
certainly, when Jeroboam, who had no such thought, is urged by the
prophet verbally, and by the oil of unction, to hope for the kingdom,
the thing was not done without the knowledge or against the will of God,
who had expressly commanded it; and yet the rebellion of the people is
justly condemned, because it was against the will of God that they
revolted from the posterity of David. For this reason, it is afterwards
added, that when Rehoboam haughtily spurned the prayers of the people,
“the cause was from the Lord, that he might perform his saying, which
the Lord spake by Ahijah,” (<span id="iv.i.xix-p16.4"></span>[I Kings
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p16.4"></span>). See how sacred unity was violated against
the will of God, while, at the same time, with his will the ten tribes
were alienated from the son of Solomon. To this might be added another
similar example—viz. the murder of the sons of Ahab, and the
extermination of his whole progeny by the consent, or rather the active
agency, of the people. Jehu says truly “There shall fall unto the earth
nothing of the word of the Lord, which the Lord spake concerning the
house of Ahab: for the Lord has done that which he spake by his servant
Elijah,” (<span id="iv.i.xix-p16.5"></span>[2 Kings
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.i.xix-p16.5"></span>). And yet, with good reason, he upbraids the
citizens of Samaria for having lent their assistance. “Ye be righteous:
behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him, but who slew all
these?”

<span id="iv.i.xix-p17"></span>If I mistake not, I have already shown
clearly how the same act at once betrays the guilt of man, and manifests
the righteousness of God. Modest minds will always be satisfied with
Augustine’s answer, “Since the Father delivered up the Son, Christ his
own body, and Judas his Master, how in such a case is God just, and man
guilty, but just because in the one act which they did, the reasons for
which they did it are different?” (*August. <span
id="iv.i.xix-p17.1"></span>Ep. 48<span id="iv.i.xix-p17.1"></span>, ad
Vincentium*). If any are not perfectly satisfied with this
explanation—viz. that there is no concurrence between God and man, when
by His righteous impulse man does what he ought not to do, let them give
heed to what Augustine elsewhere observes: “Who can refrain from
trembling at those Judgments when God does according to his pleasure
even in the hearts of the wicked, at the same time rendering to them
according to their deeds?” (*De Grat. et lib. Arbit. ad Valent.* c. 20).
And certainly, in regard to the treachery of Judas, there is just as
little ground to throw the blame of the crime upon God, because He was
both pleased that his Son should be delivered up to death, and did
deliver him, as to ascribe to Judas the praise of our redemption. Hence
Augustine, in another place, truly observes, that when God makes his
scrutiny, he looks not to what men could do, or to what they did, but to
what they wished to do, thus taking account of their will and purpose.
Those to whom this seems harsh had better consider how far their
captiousness is entitled to any toleration, while, on the ground of its
exceeding their capacity, they reject a matter which is clearly taught
by Scripture, and complain of the enunciation of truths, which, if they
were not useful to be known, God never would have ordered his prophets
and apostles to teach. Our true wisdom is to embrace with meek docility,
and without reservation, whatever the Holy Scriptures, have delivered.
Those who indulge their petulance, a petulance manifestly directed
against God, are undeserving of a longer refutation.

perversment le commandement de Dieu avec son vouloir secret, veu qu’il
appert par exemples infinis qu’il y a bien longue distance et diversité
de l’un à l’autre;” for they perversely confound the command of God with
his secret will, though it appears, by an infinite number of examples,
that there is a great distance and diversity between them.
