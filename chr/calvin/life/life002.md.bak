# <span id="iii-p0.1"></span>CHAPTER I.

#### <span id="iii-p0.2"></span>LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN MAN. SCRIPTURAL ARGUMENTS EXHORTING TO IT.

<span id="iii-p1"></span>This first chapter consists of two parts,—I.
Connection between this treatise on the Christian Life and the doctrine
of Regeneration and Repentance. Arrangement of the treatise, sec. 1–3.
II. Extremes to be avoided; 1. False Christians denying Christ by their
works condemned, sec. 4. 2. Christians should not despair, though they
have not attained perfection, provided they make daily progress in piety
and righteousness.

<span id="iii-p2"></span>1. WE have said that the object of regeneration
is to bring the life of believers into concord and harmony with the
righteousness of God, and so confirm the adoption by which they have
been received as sons. But although the law comprehends within it that
new life by which the image of God is restored in us, yet, as our
sluggishness stands greatly in need both of helps and incentives it will
be useful to collect out of Scripture a true account of this
reformations lest any who have a heartfelt desire of repentance should
in their zeal go astray. Moreover, I am not unaware that, in undertaking
to describe the life of the Christian, I am entering on a large and
extensive subject, one which, when fully considered in all its parts, is
sufficient to fill a large volume. We see the length to which the
Fathers in treating of individual virtues extend their exhortations.
This they do, not from mere loquaciousness; for whatever be the virtue
which you undertake to recommend, your pen is spontaneously led by the
copiousness of the matter so to amplify, that you seem not to have
discussed it properly if you have not done it at length. My intention,
however, in the plan of life which I now propose to give, is not to
extend it so far as to treat of each virtue specially, and expatiate in
exhortation. This must be sought in the writings of others, and
particularly in the Homilies of the Fathers. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) For me it will be sufficient to point out
the method by which a pious man may be taught how to frame his life
aright, and briefly lay down some universal rule by which he may not
improperly regulate his conduct. I shall one day possibly find time for
more ample discourse, \[or leave others to perform an office for which I
am not so fit. I have a natural love of brevity, and, perhaps, any
attempt of mine at copiousness would not succeed. Even if I could gain
the highest applause by being more prolix, I would scarcely be disposed
to attempt it, <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) \] while the nature of
my present work requires me to glance at simple doctrine with as much
brevity as possible. As philosophers have certain definitions of
rectitude and honesty, from which they derive particular duties and the
whole train of virtues; so in this respect Scripture is not without
order, but presents a most beautiful arrangement, one too which is every
way much more certain than that of philosophers. The only difference is,
that they, under the influence of ambition, constantly affect an
exquisite perspicuity of arrangement, which may serve to display their
genius, whereas the Spirit of God, teaching without affectation, is not
so perpetually observant of exact method, and yet by observing it at
times sufficiently intimates that it is not to be neglected.

<span id="iii-p3"></span>2. The Scripture system of which we speak aims
chiefly at two objects. The former is, that the love of righteousness,
to which we are by no means naturally inclined, may be instilled and
implanted into our minds. The latter is, (see chap. ii.,) to prescribe a
rule which will prevent us while in the pursuit of righteousness from
going astray. It has numerous admirable methods of recommending
righteousness. <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) Many have been already
pointed out in different parts of this work; but we shall here also
briefly advert to some of them. With what better foundation can it begin
than by reminding us that we must be holy, because “God is holy?” (<span
id="iii-p3.3"></span>[Lev. xix. 1](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii-p3.3"></span>; <span id="iii-p3.4"></span>[1 Pet. i.
16.](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016)<span id="iii-p3.4"></span>.md) For
when we were scattered abroad like lost sheep, wandering through the
labyrinth of this world, he brought us back again to his own fold. When
mention is made of our union with God, let us remember that holiness
must be the bond; not that by the merit of holiness we come into
communion with him, (we ought rather first to cleave to him, in order
that, pervaded with his holiness, we may follow whither he calls,) but
because it greatly concerns his glory not to have any fellowship with
wickedness and impurity. Wherefore he tells us that this is the end of
our calling, the end to which we ought ever to have respect, if we would
answer the call of God. For to what end were we rescued from the
iniquity and pollution of the world into which we were plunged, if we
allow ourselves, during our whole lives, to wallow in them? Besides, we
are at the same time admonished, that if we would be regarded as the
Lord’s people, we must inhabit the holy city Jerusalem, (Isaiah rev. 8,
*et alibi*;) which, as he hath consecrated it to himself, it were
impious for its inhabitants to profane by impurity. Hence the
expressions, “Who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy
holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,” (<span
id="iii-p3.5"></span>[Ps. 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002.md)<span id="iii-p3.5"></span>; <span
id="iii-p3.6"></span>[Ps. 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004)<span id="iii-p3.6"></span>.md) for the
sanctuary in which he dwells certainly ought not to be like an unclean
stall.

<span id="iii-p4"></span>3. The better to arouse us, it exhibits God the
Father, who, as he hath reconciled us to himself in his Anointed, has
impressed his image upon us, to which he would have us to be conformed,
(<span id="iii-p4.1"></span>[Rom. v.
4](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004)<span id="iii-p4.1"></span>..md) Come,
then, and let them show me a more excellent system among philosophers,
who think that they only have a moral philosophy duly and orderly
arranged. They, when they would give excellent exhortations to virtue,
can only tell us to live agreeably to nature. Scripture derives its
exhortations from the true source, <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)
when it not only enjoins us to regulate our lives with a view to God its
author to whom it belongs; but after showing us that we have degenerated
from our true origin, viz., the law of our Creator, adds, that Christ,
through whom we have returned to favour with God, is set before us as a
model, the image of which our lives should express. What do you require
more effectual than this? Nay, what do you require beyond this? If the
Lord adopts us for his sons on the condition that our life be a
representation of Christ, the bond of our adoption,—then, unless we
dedicate and devote ourselves to righteousness, we not only, with the
utmost perfidy, revolt from our Creator, but also abjure the Saviour
himself. Then, from an enumeration of all the blessings of God, and each
part of our salvation, it finds materials for exhortation. Ever since
God exhibited himself to us as a Father, we must be convicted of extreme
ingratitude if we do not in turn exhibit ourselves as his sons. Ever
since Christ purified us by the laver of his blood, and communicated
this purification by baptism, it would ill become us to be defiled with
new pollution. Ever since he ingrafted us into his body, we, who are his
members, should anxiously beware of contracting any stain or taint. Ever
since he who is our head ascended to heaven, it is befitting in us to
withdraw our affections from the earth, and with our whole soul aspire
to heaven. Ever since the Holy Spirit dedicated us as temples to the
Lord, we should make it our endeavour to show forth the glory of God,
and guard against being profaned by the defilement of sin. Ever since
our soul and body were destined to heavenly incorruptibility and an
unfading crown, we should earnestly strive to keep them pure and
uncorrupted against the day of the Lord. These, I say, are the surest
foundations of a well-regulated life, and you will search in vain for
any thing resembling them among philosophers, who, in their commendation
of virtue, never rise higher than the natural dignity of man.

<span id="iii-p5"></span>4. This is the place to address those who,
having nothing of Christ but the name and sign, would yet be called
Christians. How dare they boast of this sacred name? None have
intercourse with Christ but those who have acquired the true knowledge
of him from the Gospel. The Apostle denies that any man truly has
learned Christ who has not learned to put off “the old man, which is
corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and put on Christ,” (<span
id="iii-p5.1"></span>[Eph. iv.
22.](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)<span id="iii-p5.1"></span>.md) They
are convicted, therefore, of falsely and unjustly pretending a knowledge
of Christ, whatever be the volubility and eloquence with which they can
talk of the Gospel. Doctrine is not an affair of the tongue, but of the
life; is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely, like other
branches of learning; but is received only when it possesses the whole
soul, and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the
heart. Let them, therefore, either cease to insult God, by boasting that
they are what they are not, or let them show themselves not unworthy
disciples of their divine Master. To doctrine in which our religion is
contained we have given the first place, since by it our salvation
commences; but it must be transfused into the breast, and pass into the
conduct, and so transform us into itself, as not to prove unfruitful. If
philosophers are justly offended, and banish from their company with
disgrace those who, while professing an art which ought to be the
mistress of their conduct, convert it into mere loquacious sophistry,
with how much better reason shall we detest those flimsy sophists who
are contented to let the Gospel play upon their lips, when, from its
efficacy, it ought to penetrate the inmost affections of the heart, fix
its seat in the soul, and pervade the whole man a hundred times more
than the frigid discourses of philosophers?

<span id="iii-p6"></span>5. I insist not that the life of the Christian
shall breathe nothing but the perfect Gospel, though this is to be
desired, and ought to be attempted. I insist not so strictly on
evangelical perfection, as to refuse to acknowledge as a Christian any
man who has not attained it. In this way all would be excluded from the
Church, since there is no man who is not far removed from this
perfection, while many, who have made but little progress, would be
undeservedly rejected. What then? Let us set this before our eye as the
end at which we ought constantly to aim. Let it be regarded as the goal
towards which we are to run. For you cannot divide the matter with God,
undertaking part of what his word enjoins, and omitting part at
pleasure. For, in the first place, God uniformly recommends integrity as
the principal part of his worship, meaning by integrity real singleness
of mind, devoid of gloss and fiction, and to this is opposed a double
mind; as if it had been said, that the spiritual commencement of a good
life is when the internal affections are sincerely devoted to God, in
the cultivation of holiness and justice. But seeing that, in this
earthly prison of the body, no man is supplied with strength sufficient
to hasten in his course with due alacrity, while the greater number are
so oppressed with weakness, that hesitating, and halting, and even
crawling on the ground, they make little progress, let every one of us
go as far as his humble ability enables him, and prosecute the journey
once begun. No one will travel so badly as not daily to make some degree
of progress. This, therefore, let us never cease to do, that we may
daily advance in the way of the Lord; and let us not despair because of
the slender measure of success. How little soever the success may
correspond with our wish, our labour is not lost when to-day is better
than yesterday, provided with true singleness of mind we keep our aim,
and aspire to the goal, not speaking flattering things to ourselves, nor
indulging our vices, but making it our constant endeavour to become
better, until we attain to goodness itself. If during the whole course
of our life we seek and follow, we shall at length attain it, when
relieved from the infirmity of flesh we are admitted to full fellowship
with God.
