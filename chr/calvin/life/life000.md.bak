# <span id="i-p0.1"></span>ON THE CHRISTIAN LIFE

## <span id="i-p0.2"></span>by John Calvin

<span id="i-p1"></span>

<span id="i-p2"></span>(*From the* Institutes of the Christian
Religion*, Bk. 3, chs. VI – X.*)

<span id="i-p3"></span>Translated by Henry Beveridge, Esq., 1845, for
the Calvin Translation Society.

<span id="i-p4"></span>This book is in the public domain.

### <span id="i-p4.1"></span>On the Christian Life

<span id="i-p5"></span>This book treats of the Life of the Christian.
Its five chapters are arranged as to admit of being classed under two
principal heads.

<span id="i-p6"></span>First, it must be held to be an universally
acknowledged point, that no man is a Christian who does not feel some
special love for righteousness, chap. i. Second, in regard to the
standard by which every man ought to regulate his life, although it
seems to be considered in chap. ii. only, yet the three following
chapters also refer to it. For it shows that the Christian has two
duties to perform. First, the observance being so arduous, he needs the
greatest patience. Hence chap. iii. treats professedly of the utility of
the cross, and chap. iv. invites to meditation on the future life.
Lastly, chap. v. clearly shows, as in no small degree conducive to this
end, how we are to use this life and its comforts without abusing them.
