*And one saith to him* Although Matthew relates this answer, as if it
were immediately connected with other sentences taken out of our Lord’s
sermons, yet I rather think that the occasion of its being spoken arose
out of the present question. The reason why the question was put appears
to have been, that Christ, who declared himself to be the author of
life, could with difficulty collect a small number of disciples. It
might appear, that a small band of men was to be saved, and that the
whole church was going to ruin: for the whole of that nation, among whom
the doctrine of Christ made no great progress, and by whom it was
universally rejected, had been adopted by God as the heir of life. A
similar doubt steals upon us, when we look at the melancholy condition
of the world. *“‘*The greater part of men pursue a life which is utterly
at variance with the Gospel. What is the meaning of this?” For this
reason Christ, directing his discourse to all, exhorted them to *strive
to enter by the narrow gate* These words were intended to withdraw his
people from a foolish curiosity, by which many are retarded and
involved, when they look around to see if any companions are joining
them, as if they were unwilling to be saved but in a crowd. When he bids
them *strive,* or labor, he conveys the information, that it is
impossible to obtain eternal life without great and appalling
difficulties. Let believers, therefore, give their earnest attention to
this object, instead of indulging in excessive curiosity about the vast
number of those who are going astray.

<span id="ix.lxv-p8"></span>**24.** *For many will seek to enter* This
was added, that we might not be deceived by a vain hope, as if the
multitude of our companions would be of any avail to us. The flesh is
willing to flatter itself, and many who now give themselves every
indulgence, promise to themselves an easy entrance into life. Thus men
practice mutual deception on each other, and fall asleep in wicked
indifference. To shake off from his own people those flattering hopes,
Christ declares that those who calculate that their possession of life
is already certain, will be shut out.  <span

<span id="ix.lxv-p9"></span> Our author appears to have become
apprehensive that this language was ambiguous, and, lest it might be
interpreted differently from what he intended, he has taken care to
insert in the French Version an explanatory clause: “<span
id="ix.lxv-p9.1"></span>que ceux qui se font accroire qu'ils sont desia
tout asseurez de la vie eternelle, *et cheminent a leur plaisir sans
souci,* en seront rejettez;” —”that those who make themselves believe
that they are already perfectly assured of eternal life, *and walk on at
their pleasure without concern,* will be excluded from it.” — *Ed.*
