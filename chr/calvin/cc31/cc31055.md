more suitable occasion for discussing and explaining this doctrine at
greater length will afterwards occur, (<span
id="ix.xlvii-p9.3"></span>[Mt
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009)<span id="ix.xlvii-p9.3"></span>,.md)
I shall now state briefly what Christ says in this passage. As the Jews
falsely imagined that they discharged their whole duty toward God, when
they kept the law in a national manner, so whatever the national law did
not forbid, they foolishly supposed to be lawful. Divorces, which
husbands were wont to give to their wives, had not been prohibited by
Moses as to external order, but only, for the sake of restraining
lewdness, he had ordered that “a bill of divorcement” should be given to
the wives who were put away, (<span id="ix.xlvii-p9.4"></span>[De
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001)<span id="ix.xlvii-p9.4"></span>..md)
It was a sort of testimonial of freedom, so that the woman was
afterwards free from the yoke and power of the husband; while the
husband at the same time acknowledged, that he did not send her away on
account of any crime, but because she did not please him. Hence
proceeded the error, that there was nothing wrong in such putting away,
provided that the forms of law were observed.  <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md)

<span id="ix.xlvii-p11"></span>But they did wrong in viewing as a matter
of civil law, the rule which had been given them for a devout and holy
life. For national laws are sometimes accommodated to the manners of men
but God, in prescribing a spiritual law, looked not at what men can do,
but at what they ought to do. It contains a perfect and entire
righteousness, though we want ability to fulfill it. Christ, therefore,
admonishes us not to conclude, that what is allowed by the national law
of Moses is, on that account, lawful in the sight of God. That man,
(says he,) who puts away his wife, and gives her *a bill of
divorcement,* shelters himself under the pretense of the law: but the
bond of marriage is too sacred to be dissolved at the will, or rather at
the licentious pleasure, of men. Though the husband and the wife are
united by mutual consent, yet God binds them by an indissoluble tie, so
that they are not afterwards at liberty to separate. An exception is
added, *except on account of fornication:* for the woman, who has basely
violated the marriage-vow, is justly cast off; because it was by her
fault that the tie was broken, and the husband set at liberty.

<span id="ix.xlvii-p12"></span><span id="ix.xlvii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xlvii-p13"></span>**32.** *Causeth her to commit adultery.*
As the *bill of divorcement* bore, that the woman had been loosed from
her former husband, and might enter into a new marriage, the man who,
unjustly and unlawfully, abandons the wife whom God had given him, is
justly condemned for having prostituted his wife to others.
