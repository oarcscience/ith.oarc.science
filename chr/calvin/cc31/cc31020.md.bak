<span id="ix.xii-p1"></span>LUKE 1:67-75

<span id="ix.xii-p2"></span><span id="ix.xii-p2.1"></span>[Luke
1:67-75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#067.md)<span id="ix.xii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p3"></span> **67**.** **And Zacharias his father was
filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying: **68**.** **Blessed
be the Lord God of israel, because he hath visited, and hath brought
redemption to his people: **69**.** **And he hath raised up the horn
 <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) of salvation to us in the house of
his servant David, (**70**.** **As he spake by the mouth of his holy
prophets, who have been from every age,)  <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) **71**.** **Salvation from our enemies,
and from the hand of all who hated us: **72**.** **To perform the mercy
to our fathers, and to have remembrance of his holy covenant,
**73**.** **According to the oath,  <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md)
which he sware to Abraham our father, to give to us, **74**.** **That,
being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without
fear, **75**.** **In holiness and righteousness before him all the days
of our life.

<span id="ix.xii-p7"></span> 

<span id="ix.xii-p8"></span><span id="ix.xii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p9"></span>**67.** *Zacharias was filled with the Holy
Ghost* We have lately explained this phrase to mean, that the servants
of God received more abundantly the grace of the Spirit, of which, at
other times, they were not destitute. Thus we read, that the Spirit was
given to the prophets: not that on other occasions they wanted it, but
that the power of the Spirit was more fully exerted in them, when the
hand of God, as it were, brought them into public view, for the
discharge of their office. We must observe, therefore, the manner in
which Luke connects the two clauses: he *was filled with the Holy Ghost,
and prophesied* This implies that divine inspiration, at that time,
rested upon him in an extraordinary measure, in consequence of which he
did not speak like a man or private person, but all that he uttered was
heavenly instruction. Thus also Paul connects prophecy with the Spirit.

<span id="ix.xii-p10"></span>“Quench not the Spirit: despise not
prophesyings,”  
(<span id="ix.xii-p10.2"></span>[1 Thess.
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020)<span id="ix.xii-p10.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xii-p11"></span>which teaches us that to despise
instruction is to *“quench”* the light of “the Spirit.” This was a
remarkable instance of the goodness of God, that not only did Zacharias
recover the power of speech, which he had not enjoyed for nine months,
but his tongue became the organ of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="ix.xii-p12"></span><span id="ix.xii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p13"></span>**68.** *Blessed be the Lord God* Zacharias
commences with thanksgiving, and in the raptures of the prophetic spirit
describes the fulfillment of the redemption formerly promised in Christ,
on which the safety and prosperity of the church depended. The reason
why *the Lord,* to whose government the whole world is subject, is here
called *the God of Israel,* will more fully appear from what follows,
that to the seed of Abraham, in a peculiar manner, the Redeemer had been
promised. Since, therefore, God had deposited with one nation only his
covenant, of which Zacharias was about to speak, he properly mentions
the name of that nation, for which the grace of salvation was
especially, or at all events in the first instance, designed.

<span id="ix.xii-p14"></span>The word <span
id="ix.xii-p14.1"></span>ἐπεσκέψατο*, he hath visited,* contains an
implied contrast: for the face of God had been turned away for a time
from the unhappy children of Abraham. To such a depth of calamity had
they sunk, and with such a mass of distresses were they overwhelmed,
that no one entertained the thought that the eye of God was upon them.
This visitation of God, which Zacharias mentions, is declared to be the
cause and origin of redemption. The statement may be resolved in this
manner. God *looked upon (*<span id="ix.xii-p14.2"></span>ἐπεσκέψατο*)
his people, that he might redeem them* Now, as those whom God redeems
must be prisoners, and as this redemption is spiritual in its nature, we
conclude from this passage, that even the holy fathers were made free
from the yoke of sin and the tyranny of death, only through the grace of
Christ; for it is said that Christ was sent as a Redeemer to the holy
and elect people of God. But it will be objected, if redemption was
brought by Christ at that time when he appeared clothed in flesh, it
follows, that those believers who died before he came into the world
were “all their lifetime” slaves of sin and death: which would be highly
absurd. I reply, the power and efficacy of that redemption, which was
once exhibited in Christ, have been the same in all ages.

<span id="ix.xii-p15"></span><span id="ix.xii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p16"></span>**69.** *He hath raised up the horn of
salvation* That is, saving power:  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md)
for, when the throne of David was cast down, and the people scattered,
the hope of salvation had to all appearance perished. Zacharias alludes
to the predictions of the prophets, which hold out that a sudden revival
would take place, when the state of affairs should have become
melancholy and desperate. This mode of expression is borrowed from the
passage,

<span id="ix.xii-p18"></span>“There will I make the horn of David to
bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed,” (<span
id="ix.xii-p18.1"></span>[Ps
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md)<span
id="ix.xii-p18.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.xii-p19"></span>But if it is only in Christ that God has
put forth his power to save us*,* we are not at liberty to depart from
that method, if we desire to obtain salvation from God. Let it be also
observed, that this *horn* brings *salvation* to believers, but terror
to the ungodly, whom it scatters, or bruises and lays prostrate.

<span id="ix.xii-p20"></span>*Of his servant David* He is so
denominated, not only because, like any one of the godly, he worshipped
God, but for this other reason, that he was his chosen servant to rule
and save his people, and thus to represent, along with his successors,
the person and office of Christ. Though there remained among the Jews,
at that time, no trace of a kingdom, Zacharias, resting on the promises
of God, does not hesitate to call David the *servant* of God, in whom
God gave an example of the salvation which was to come.  <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) Now that the throne of Christ is erected
amongst us, that thence he may govern us, it follows that he is actually
appointed to us the author of salvation.

<span id="ix.xii-p22"></span><span id="ix.xii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p23"></span>**70.** *As he spake* That the salvation
which is said to have been brought by Christ may not be thought doubtful
on the score of novelty, he adduces as witnesses all the *Prophets,*
who, though they were raised up at different times, yet with one consent
teach, that salvation is to be expected from Christ alone. Nor was it
the sole design of Zacharias to celebrate the truth and faithfulness of
God, in performing and fulfilling what he formerly promised. His object
rather was to draw the attention of believers to the ancient
predictions, that they might embrace, with greater certainty and
cheerfulness, the salvation offered to them, of which the Prophets from
the beginning had testified. When Christ comes forth adorned,  <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) with the testimonies of all the Prophets,
our faith in him rests on a truly solid foundation.

<span id="ix.xii-p25"></span>He calls them *holy prophets,* to secure
for their words greater authority and reverence. They were not
inconsiderable or ordinary witnesses, but were of the first rank,  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) and furnished with a public commission,
having been separated from the common people, for that purpose, by
divine authority. To inquire minutely how each of the prophets gave
testimony to Christ, would lead us into a long dissertation. Let it
suffice for the present to say, that they all uniformly make the hope of
the people, that God would be gracious to them, to rest entirely on that
covenant between God and them which was founded on Christ, and thus
speak plainly enough of the future redemption, which was manifested in
Christ. To this purpose are many striking passages, which contain no
dark prophecies respecting Christ, but point him out, as it were, with
the finger. But our chief attention is due to the signature of the
divine covenant; for he that neglects this will never understand any
thing in the prophets: as the Jews wander wretchedly  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) in reading the Scripture, in consequence
of giving their whole study to words, and wandering from the main
design.

<span id="ix.xii-p28"></span><span id="ix.xii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p29"></span>**71.** *Salvation from our enemies*
Zacharias explains more clearly the power and office of Christ. And
certainly it would be of little or no advantage to learn that Christ was
given to us, unless we also knew what he bestows. For this reason he
states more fully the purpose for which the *horn of salvation* was
*raised up:* that believers may obtain *salvation from their enemies*
Unquestionably, Zacharias was well aware, that the principal war of the
church of God is not with flesh and blood, but with Satan and all his
armament, by which he labors to accomplish our everlasting ruin. Though
the Church is also attacked by outward foes, and is delivered from them
by Christ, yet, as the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, it is chiefly to
Satan, the prince of this world, and all his legions, that the present
discourse relates. Our attention is also directed to the miserable
condition of men out of Christ, lying prostrate under the tyranny of the
devil: otherwise, out of his hand, out of his power, Christ would not
deliver his own people. This passage reminds us that, so long as the
Church continues her pilgrimage in the world, she lives amongst her
foes, and would be exposed to their violence, if Christ were not always
at hand to grant assistance. But such is the inestimable grace of
Christ, that, though we are surrounded on every side by enemies, we
enjoy a sure and undoubted salvation. The mode of expression may seem
harsh, *salvation from our enemies;* but the meaning is obvious. No
machinations or power, no wiles, no attacks will prevent our being
delivered from them and saved *“*in the Lord with an everlasting
salvatlon,” (<span id="ix.xii-p29.1"></span>[Isa
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017)<span id="ix.xii-p29.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xii-p30"></span><span id="ix.xii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p31"></span>**72.** *To perform the mercy* Zacharias
again points out the fountain from which redemption flowed, the *mercy*
and gracious *covenant* of God. He assigns the reason why God was
pleased to save his people. It was because, being mindful of his
promise, he displayed his mercy. He is said to have *remembrance of his
covenant,* because there might be some appearance of forgetfulness
during that long delay, in which he allowed his people to languish under
the weight of very heavy calamities. We must carefully attend to this
order. First, God was moved by pure mercy to make a covenant with the
fathers. Secondly, He has linked the salvation of men with his own word.
 <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) Thirdly, He has exhibited in
Christ every blessing, so as to ratify all his promises: as, indeed,
their truth is only confirmed to us when we see their fulfillment in
Christ. Forgiveness of sins is promised in the covenant, but it is in
the blood of Christ. Righteousness is promised, but it is offered
through the atonement of Christ. Life is promised, but it must be sought
only in the death and resurrection of Christ. This too is the reason why
God commanded of old, that the book of the law should be sprinkled with
the blood of the sacrifice, (<span id="ix.xii-p32.2"></span>[Ex
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md)<span id="ix.xii-p32.2"></span>;
<span id="ix.xii-p32.3"></span>[Heb.
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#020)<span id="ix.xii-p32.3"></span>..md)
It is also worthy of notice, that Zacharias speaks of the mercy
*performed* in his own age, as extending to the fathers who were dead,
and who equally shared in its results. Hence it follows, that the grace
and power of Christ are not confined by the narrow limits of this fading
life, but are everlasting; that they are not terminated by the death of
the flesh, for the soul survives the death of the body, and the
destruction of the flesh is followed by the resurrection. As neither
Abraham, nor any of the saints, could procure salvation to himself by
his own power or merits, so to all believers, whether living or dead,
the same salvation has been exhibited in Christ.

<span id="ix.xii-p33"></span><span id="ix.xii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p34"></span>**73.** *According to the oath* There is no
word in the Greek original for the preposition *according to:* but it is
a common and well understood principle of language, that when the
accusative case is put absolutely, there is a preposition to be
understood, by which it is governed. *The oath* is mentioned, for the
purpose of expressing more fully the firmness and sacredness of his
truth: for such is his gracious condescension, that he deigns to employ
his name for the support of our weakness. If his bare promises do not
satisfy us, let us at least remember this confirmation of them; and if
it does not remove all doubt, we are chargeable with heinous ingratitude
to God, and insult to his holy name.

<span id="ix.xii-p35"></span>*To give to us* Zacharias does not
enumerate the several points of God’s covenant, but shows that God’s
purpose, in dealing so kindly and mercifully with his people, was to
redeem them.

<span id="ix.xii-p36"></span><span id="ix.xii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p37"></span>**74.** *That being delivered out of the
hand of our enemies* His purpose was, that, being redeemed, they might
dedicate and consecrate themselves entirely to the Author of their
salvation. As the efficient cause of human salvation was the undeserved
goodness of God, so its final cause is, that, by a godly and holy life,
men may glorify his name. This deserves careful attention, that we may
remember our calling, and so learn to apply the grace of God to its
proper use. We must meditate on such declarations as these:

<span id="ix.xii-p38"></span>“God hath not called us unto uncleanness,
but unto holiness,”  
(<span id="ix.xii-p38.2"></span>[1Th
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007)<span id="ix.xii-p38.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xii-p39"></span>We are “redeemed with a great price,”
(<span id="ix.xii-p39.1"></span>[1Co
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020)<span id="ix.xii-p39.1"></span>,.md)
“the precious blood of Christ,” (<span id="ix.xii-p39.2"></span>[1 Pet.
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019)<span id="ix.xii-p39.2"></span>,.md)
not that we may serve “the lusts of the flesh,” (<span
id="ix.xii-p39.3"></span>[2Pe
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018)<span id="ix.xii-p39.3"></span>,.md)
or indulge in unbridled licentiousness, but that Christ may reign in us.
We are admitted by adoption into the family of God, that we, on our
part, may yield obedience as children to a father. For “the kindness and
love (<span id="ix.xii-p39.4"></span>φιλανθρωπία) of God our Savior
toward man,” (<span id="ix.xii-p39.5"></span>Titus 3:4,) “hath appeared
unto all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
we should live soberly, righteously, and godly,” (<span
id="ix.xii-p39.6"></span>Titus 2:11,12.) And so Paul, when he wishes
powerfully to exhort believers to consecrate themselves to God, “in
newness of life,” (<span id="ix.xii-p39.7"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="ix.xii-p39.7"></span>,.md)
and, “putting off, concerning the former conversation, the old man,”
(<span id="ix.xii-p39.8"></span>[Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)<span id="ix.xii-p39.8"></span>,.md)
to render to him a “reasonable service,” “beseeches them by the mercies
of God,” (<span id="ix.xii-p39.9"></span>[Ro
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001)<span id="ix.xii-p39.9"></span>..md)
Scripture is full of declarations of this nature, which show that we
“frustrate the grace” (<span id="ix.xii-p39.10"></span>[Ga
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021)<span id="ix.xii-p39.10"></span>.md)
of Christ, if we do not follow out this design.

<span id="ix.xii-p40"></span>*That we may serve him without fear* This
deserves our attention: for it implies that we cannot worship God in a
proper manner without composure of mind. Those who are ill at ease, who
have an inward struggle, whether God is favorable or hostile to them,
whether he accepts or rejects their services,—in a word, who fluctuate
in uncertainty between hope and fear, will sometimes labor anxiously in
the worship of God, but never will sincerely or honestly obey him. Alarm
and dread make them turn from him with horror; and so, if it were
possible, they would desire that there were, “no God,” (<span
id="ix.xii-p40.1"></span>[Ps 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xii-p40.1"></span>.) But we know, that no sacrifice is acceptable
to God, which is not offered willingly, and with a cheerful heart.
Before men can truly worship *God,* they must obtain peace of
conscience, as David speaks, “There is forgiveness with thee, that thou
mayest be feared,” (<span id="ix.xii-p40.2"></span>[Ps
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004)<span id="ix.xii-p40.2"></span>:.md)
for those to whom God has given peace are graciously invited and led to
approach him willingly and with a cheerful desire to worship him. Hence
too Paul deduces that maxim, that “whatsoever is undertaken without
faith is sin,” (<span id="ix.xii-p40.3"></span>[Ro
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023)<span id="ix.xii-p40.3"></span>..md)
But since God reconciles men to himself in Christ, since by his
protection he keeps them safe from all fear, since he has committed
their salvation to his own hand and guardianship, we are justly declared
by Zacharias to be delivered by his grace from fear. And so the prophets
describe it as peculiar to his reign, that,

<span id="ix.xii-p41"></span>“they shall sit every man under his vine,
and under his fig-tree, and none shall make them afraid,” (<span
id="ix.xii-p41.1"></span>[Mic 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.xii-p41.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.xii-p42"></span><span id="ix.xii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p43"></span>**75.** *In holiness and righteousness* As
the rule of a good life has been reduced by God to two tables, (<span
id="ix.xii-p43.1"></span>[Exod. 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md),
[Exod. 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xii-p43.1"></span>,) so Zacharias here declares, that we serve
God in a proper manner, when our life has been framed to *holiness and
righteousness. Holiness,* beyond all question, denotes—as even Plato
knew the duties of godliness,  <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md)
which relate to the first table of the law. *Righteousness,* again,
extends to all the duties of charity: for God requires nothing more from
us in the second table of the law, than to render to every one what
belongs to him. It is added, *before him,* to instruct believers, that
it is not enough if their lives are decently regulated before the eyes
of men, and their hands, and feet, and whole body, restrained from every
kind of open wickedness: but they must live according to the will of
God, who is not satisfied with professions of holiness, but looks
chiefly on the heart.

<span id="ix.xii-p45"></span>Lastly, That no man may consider his duties
to be at an end, when he has worshipped God for a certain period,
Zacharias declares that men have been redeemed on the condition  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) that they shall continue to devote
themselves to the worship of God *all the days of* their *life* And
certainly, as redemption is eternal, the remembrance of it ought never
to pass away; as God adopts men into his family for ever, their
gratitude ought not to be transitory or of short continuance; and, in a
word, as “Christ both died and rose, and revived” for them, it is proper
that he should be “Lord both of the dead and living,” (<span
id="ix.xii-p46.3"></span>[Ro 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.xii-p46.3"></span>.) So Paul, in a passage which I lately quoted,
enjoins us to

<span id="ix.xii-p47"></span>“live soberly, righteously, and godly, in
this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ; who gave himself
for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto
himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works,”  
(<span id="ix.xii-p47.2"></span>Titus 2:12-14.)
