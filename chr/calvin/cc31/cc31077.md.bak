laid the foundation on a rock: and when the deluge came, the stream
dashed against that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded on

built his house on the earth without a foundation, on which the stream
dashed, and immediately it fell, and great was the downfall of that

*Every one, therefore, who heareth* As it is often difficult to
distinguish the true professors of the Gospel from the false, Christ
shows, by a beautiful comparison, where the main difference lies. He
represents two houses, one of which was built without a foundation,
while the other was well-founded. Both have the same external
appearance: but, when the wind and storms blow, and the floods dash
against them, the former will immediately fall, while the latter will be
sustained by its strength against every assault. Christ therefore
compares a vain and empty profession of the Gospel to a beautiful, but
not solid, building, which, however elevated, is exposed every moment to
downfall, because it wants a foundation. Accordingly, Paul enjoins us to
be well and thoroughly founded on Christ, and to have deep roots, (<span
id="ix.lxix-p8.3"></span>[Col 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.lxix-p8.3"></span>,)

<span id="ix.lxix-p9"></span>“that we may not be tossed and driven about
by every wind of doctrine,”  
(<span id="ix.lxix-p9.2"></span>[Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)<span id="ix.lxix-p9.2"></span>.md)

<span id="ix.lxix-p10"></span>that we may not give way at every attack.
The general meaning of the passage is, that true piety is not fully
distinguished from its counterfeit,  <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) till it comes to the trial. For the
temptations, by which we are tried, are like billows and storms, which
easily overwhelm unsteady minds, whose lightness is not perceived during
the season of prosperity.

<span id="ix.lxix-p12"></span>*Who heareth these sayings* The relative
*these* denotes not one class of sayings, but the whole amount of
doctrine. He means, that the Gospel, if it be not deeply rooted in the
mind, is like a wall, which has been raised to a great height, but does
not rest on any foundation. “That faith (he says) is true, which has its
roots deep in the heart, and rests on an earnest and steady affection as
its foundation, that it may not give way to temptations.” For such is
the vanity of the human mind, that all build upon the sand, who do not
dig so deep as to deny themselves.

<span id="ix.lxix-p13"></span><span id="ix.lxix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxix-p14"></span>**28.** *When Jesus had finished these
sayings* By *these sayings* I understand not only the discourse which he
delivered when he came down from the mountain, but the rest of the
doctrine, which had already been made known to the people. The meaning
therefore is, that, where he had given the people, on all sides, a taste
of his doctrine, all were seized with astonishment, because a strange,
indescribable, and unwonted majesty drew to him the minds of men. What
is meant by his *teaching them as having authority, and not as the
scribes,* I have already explained.  <span

cannot be well distinguished from a dissembling and vain appearance of
it.”
