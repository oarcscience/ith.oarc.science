<span id="ix.liv-p6"></span> 

<span id="ix.liv-p7"></span><span id="ix.liv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.liv-p8"></span>It is uncertain whether this form was once
only or twice delivered by Christ to his disciples.  <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) Some think that the latter is more
probable; because Luke says that he was requested to do it, while
Matthew represents him as teaching it of his own accord. But as we have
said, that Matthew collects all the leading points of doctrine, in order
that the whole amount of them may be more clearly perceived by the
readers when they are placed in close succession, it is possible that
Matthew may have omitted to mention the occasion which is related by
Luke. On this subject, however, I am unwilling to debate with any
person.

<span id="ix.liv-p10"></span>**<span id="ix.liv-p10.1"></span>[Luke
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.liv-p10.1"></span>**
*As John also taught his diciples.* John delivered to his disciples a
particular form of prayer; and he did so, in my opinion, because the
time required it. The state of affairs among the Jews was, at that time,
exceedingly corrupted. Every thing connected with religion had so
miserably fallen, that we need not be surprised to find few among them,
by whom prayer was offered in a proper manner.  <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) Besides, it was proper, that the minds
of believers should be excited, by prayer, to hope and desire the
promised redemption, which was at hand. John might, therefore, have
collected, out of various passages of Scripture, a certain prayer
adapted to the time, and approaching more nearly to the spiritual
kingdom of Christ, which had already begun to be revealed.

<span id="ix.liv-p12"></span><span id="ix.liv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.liv-p13"></span>**<span id="ix.liv-p13.2"></span>[Matthew
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md)<span id="ix.liv-p13.2"></span>**
*Do ye therefore pray thus* Instead of this Luke says, *when ye pray,
say*: though Christ does not enjoin his people to pray in a prepared
form of words,  <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) but only points
out what ought to be the object of all our wishes and prayers. He
embraces, therefore, in six petitions what we are at liberty to ask from
God. Nothing is more advantageous to us than such instruction. Though
this is the most important exercise of piety, yet in forming our
prayers, and regulating our wishes, all our senses fail us. No man will
pray aright, unless his lips and heart shall be directed by the Heavenly
Master. For that purpose he has laid down this rule, by which we must
frame our prayers, if we desire to have them accounted lawful and
approved by God. It was not the intention of the Son of God, (as we have
already said), to prescribe the words which we must use, so as not to
leave us at liberty to depart from the form which he has dictated. His
intention rather was, to guide and restrain our wishes, that they might
not go beyond those limits and hence we infer, that the rule which he
has given us for praying aright relates not to the words, but to the
things themselves.

<span id="ix.liv-p15"></span>This form of prayer consists, as I have
said, of six petitions. The first three, it ought to be known, relate to
the glory of God, without any regard to ourselves; and the remaining
three relate to those things which are necessary for our salvation. As
the law of God is divided into two tables, of which the former contains
the duties of piety, and the latter the duties of charity,  <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) so in prayer Christ enjoins us to
consider and seek the glory of God, and, at the same time, permits us to
consult our own interests. Let us therefore know, that we shall be in a
state of mind for praying in a right manner, if we not only are in
earnest about ourselves and our own advantage, but assign the first
place to the glory of God: for it would be altogether preposterous to
mind only what belongs to ourselves, and to disregard the kingdom of
God, which is of far greater importance.

<span id="ix.liv-p17"></span>*Our Father who art in heaven* Whenever we
engage in prayer, there are two things to be considered, both that we
may have access to God, and that we may rely on Him with full and
unshaken confidence: his fatherly love toward us, and his boundless
power. Let us therefore entertain no doubt, that God is willing to
receive us graciously, that he is ready to listen to our prayers, — in a
word, that of Himself he is disposed to aid us. *Father* is the
appellation given to him; and under this title Christ supplies us with
sufficiently copious materials for confidence. But as it is only the
half of our reliance that is founded on the goodness of God, in the next
clause, *who art in heaven,* he gives us a lofty idea of the power of
God. When the Scripture says, that God is *in heaven,* the meaning is,
that all things are subject to his dominions, — that the world, and
everything in it, is held by his hand, — that his power is everywhere
diffused, — that all things are arranged by his providence. David says,
“He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at them,” (<span
id="ix.liv-p17.1"></span>[Ps 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.liv-p17.1"></span>); and again, “Our God is in heaven: he hath
done whatever he hath pleased,” (<span id="ix.liv-p17.2"></span>[Ps
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003)<span id="ix.liv-p17.2"></span>.md).

<span id="ix.liv-p18"></span>When God is said to be *in heaven,* we must
not suppose that he dwells only there; but, on the contrary, must hold
what is said in another passage, that “the heavens of heavens do not
contain him,” (<span id="ix.liv-p18.1"></span>[2Ch
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#006)<span id="ix.liv-p18.1"></span>.md).
This mode of expression separates him from the rank of creatures, and
reminds us that, when we think of him, we ought not to form any low or
earthly conceptions: for he is higher than the whole world. We have now
ascertained the design of Christ. In the commencement of the prayer, he
desired his own people to rest their confidence on the goodness and
power of God; because, unless our prayers are founded on faith, they
will be of no advantage. Now, as it would be the folly and madness of
presumption, to call God our Father, *except* on the ground that,
through our union to the body of Christ, we are acknowledged as his
children, we conclude, that there is no other way of praying aright, but
by approaching God with reliance on the Mediator.

<span id="ix.liv-p19"></span>*May thy name be sanctified* This makes
still more manifest what I have said, that in the first three petitions
we ought to lose sight of ourselves, and seek the glory of God: not that
it is separated from our salvation, but that the majesty of God ought to
be greatly preferred by us to every other object of solicitude. It is of
unspeakable advantage to us that God reigns, and that he receives the
honor which is due to him: but no man has a sufficiently earnest desire
to promote the glory of God, unless (so to speak) he forgets himself,
and raises his mind to seek God’s exalted greatness. There is a close
connection and resemblance between those three petitions. *The
sanctification of the name of God* is always connected with his
*kingdom;* and the most important part of his *kingdom* lies in *his
will being done.* Whoever considers how cold and negligent we are in
desiring the greatest of those blessings for which we are here commanded
to pray, will acknowledge that nothing here is superfluous, but that it
is proper that the three petitions should be thus distinguished.

<span id="ix.liv-p20"></span>To *sanctify the name of God* means nothing
else, than to *give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name,* so that
men may never think or speak of him but with the deepest veneration. The
opposite of this is the *profanation* of the name of God, which takes
place, when men either speak disrespectfully of the divine majesty, or
at least without that reverence which they ought to feel. Now, the
glory, by which it is *sanctified,* flows and results from the
acknowledgments made by men as to the wisdom, goodness, righteousness,
power, and all the other attributes of God. For holiness always dwells,
and permanently remains, in God: but men obscure it by their malice and
depravity, or dishonor and pollute it by sacrilegious contempt. The
substance of this petition is, that the glory of God may shine in the
world, and may be duly acknowledged by men. But religion is in its
highest purity and rigour, when men believe, that whatever proceeds from
God is right and proper, full of righteousness and wisdom: for the
consequence is, that they embrace his word with the obedience of faith,
and approve of all his ordinances and works. That faith which we yield
to the word of God is, so to speak, our subscription,  <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) by which we *“*set to our seal that
God is faithful,” (<span id="ix.liv-p21.2"></span>[Joh
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033)<span id="ix.liv-p21.2"></span>;.md)
as the highest dishonor that can be done to him is unbelief and contempt
of his word.

<span id="ix.liv-p22"></span>We now see, what wickedness is displayed by
most men in judging of the works of God, and how freely they allow
themselves to indulge in censure. If any of us are chastised, they
grumble, and murmur, and complain, and some break out into open
blasphemies: if he does not grant our wishes, we think that he is not
sufficiently kind to us.  <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) Many
turn into matter of idle talk and jesting his incomprehensible
providence and secret judgments. Even his holy and sacred name is often
treated with the grossest mockery. In short, a part of the world profane
his holiness to the utmost of their power. We need not then wonder, if
we are commanded to ask, in the first place, that the reverence which is
due to it may be given by the world. Besides, this is no small honor
done to us, when God recommends to us the advancement of his glory.

<span id="ix.liv-p24"></span><span id="ix.liv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.liv-p25"></span>**10.** *May thy kingdom come* Though the
Greek verb (<span id="ix.liv-p25.2"></span>ἐλθέτω) is simple, yet if,
instead of *May thy kingdom come,* we read, as it was rendered in the
old translation, *May thy kingdom arrive,*  <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) the meaning will remain unchanged. We
must first attend to the definition of the *kingdom* of God. He is said
to *reign* among men, when they voluntarily devote and submit themselves
to be governed by him, placing their flesh under the yoke, and
renouncing their desires. Such is the corruption of the nature, that all
our affections are so many soldiers of Satan, who oppose the justice of
God, and consequently obstruct or disturb his *reign.* By this prayer we
ask, that he may remove all hindrances, and may bring all men under his
dominion, and may lead them to meditate on the heavenly life.

<span id="ix.liv-p27"></span>This is done partly by the preaching of the
word, and partly by the secret power of the Spirit. It is his will to
govern men by his word: but as the bare voice, if the inward power of
the Spirit be not added, does not pierce the hearts of men, both must be
joined together, in order that the *kingdom* of God may be established.
We therefore pray that God would exert his power, both by the Word and
by the Spirit, that the whole world may willingly submit to him. The
*kingdom* of God is opposed to all disorder (<span
id="ix.liv-p27.1"></span>ἀταξία) and confusion for good order is nowhere
found in the world, except when he regulates by his hand the schemes and
dispositions of men. Hence we conclude, that the commencement of the
*reign* of God in us is the destruction of the old man, and the denial
of ourselves, that we may be renewed to another life.

<span id="ix.liv-p28"></span>There is still another way in which God
reigns; and that is, when he overthrows his enemies, and compels them,
with Satan their head, to yield a reluctant subjection to his authority,
“till they all be made his footstools” (<span
id="ix.liv-p28.1"></span>[Heb
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013)<span id="ix.liv-p28.1"></span>..md)
The substance of this prayer is, that God would enlighten the world by
the light of his Word, — would form the hearts of men, by the influences
of his Spirit, to obey his justice, and would restore to order, by the
gracious exercise of his power, all the disorder that exists in the
world. Now, he commences his reign by subduing the desires of our flesh.
Again, as the *kingdom* of God is continually growing and advancing to
the end of the world, we must pray every day that it *may come:* for to
whatever extent iniquity abounds in the world, to such an extent *the
kingdom of God,* which brings along with it perfect righteousness, is
not yet *come.*

<span id="ix.liv-p29"></span>*May thy will be done* Although the *will*
of God, viewed in itself, is one and simple, it is presented to us in
Scripture under a twofold aspect.  <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) It is said, that the will of God is
done, when he executes the secret counsels of his providence, however
obstinately men may strive to oppose him. But here we are commanded to
pray that, in another sense, *his will may be done,* — that all
creatures may obey him, without opposition, and without reluctance. This
appears more clearly from the comparison, *as in heaven* For, as He has
the angels constantly ready to execute his commands, (and hence they are
said to *do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word,*
<span id="ix.liv-p30.2"></span>[Ps
103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020.md)<span
id="ix.liv-p30.2"></span>,) so we desire that all men may have their
will formed to such harmony with the righteousness of God, that they may
freely bend in whatever direction he shall appoint. It is, no doubt, a
holy desire, when we bow to the *will* of God, and acquiesce in his
appointments. But this prayer implies something more. It is a prayer,
that God may remove all the obstinacy of men, which rises in unceasing
rebellion against him, and may render them gentle and submissive, that
they may not wish or desire any thing but what pleases him, and meets
his approbation.

<span id="ix.liv-p31"></span>But it may be objected: Ought we to ask
from God what, he declares, will never exist to the end of the world? I
reply: When we pray that the earth may become obedient to the will of
God, it is not necessary that we should look particularly at every
individual. It is enough for us to declare, by such a prayer as this,
that we hate and regret whatever we perceive to be contrary to the will
of God, and long for its utter destruction, not only that it may be the
rule of all our affections, but that we may yield ourselves without
reserve, and with all cheerfulness, to its fulfillment.

<span id="ix.liv-p32"></span><span id="ix.liv-p32.1"></span>

<span id="ix.liv-p33"></span>**11.** *Give us today our daily bread* Of
the form of prayer which Christ has prescribed to us this may be called,
as I have said, the Second Table. I have adopted this mode of dividing
it for the sake of instruction.  <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md)
The precepts which relate to the proper manner of worshipping God are
contained in the First Table of the law, and those which relate to the
duties of charity in the Second. Again, in this prayer, — “I have
formerly divided it thus, in order to instruct more familiarly.” our
Lord first instructs us to seek the glory of God, and then points out,
in the second part, what we ought to ask for ourselves. But it must be
observed, that the prayers which we offer for our salvation, or for our
own advantage, ought to have this for their ultimate object: for we must
not be so exclusively occupied with what is advantageous to ourselves,
as to omit, in any instance, to give the first place to the glory of
God. When we pray, therefore, we must never turn away our eyes from that
object.

<span id="ix.liv-p35"></span>There is this difference, however, between
the two kinds of petitions which we have mentioned. When we pray for
*the kingdom of God* and the *sanctification of his name,* our eyes
ought to be directed upwards, so as to lose sight of ourselves, and to
be fixed on God alone. We then come down to ourselves, and connect with
those former petitions, which look to God alone, solicitude about our
own salvation. Though the *forgiveness of sins* is to be preferred to
food,  <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) as far as the soul is
more valuable than the body, yet our Lord commenced with *bread* and the
supports of an earthly life, that from such a beginning he might carry
us higher. We do not ask that our daily bread may be given to us before
we ask that we may be reconciled to God, as if the perishing food of the
belly were to be considered more valuable than the eternal salvation of
the soul: but we do so that we may ascend, as it were by steps, from
earth to heaven. Since God condescends to nourish our bodies, there can
be no doubt whatever, that he is far more careful of our spiritual life.
This kind and gentle manner of treating us raises our confidence higher.

<span id="ix.liv-p37"></span>Some are of opinion, that <span
id="ix.liv-p37.1"></span>τὸν ἄζτον ἡμῶν ἐπιούσιον means *our
supersubstantial bread* This is exceedingly absurd. The reason assigned
by Erasmus is not only frivolous, but inconsistent with piety. He
reckons it improbable that, when we come into the presence of God,
Christ should enjoin us to make mention of food. As if this manner of
instruction were not to be found in every part of Scripture, to lead us
to the expectation of heavenly blessings, by giving us a taste of
temporal blessings. It is indeed the true proof of our faith, when we
ask nothing but from God, and not only acknowledge him to be the only
fountain of all blessings, but feel that his fatherly kindness extends
to the smallest matters, so that he does not disdain to take care even
of our flesh.

<span id="ix.liv-p38"></span>That Christ speaks here of bodily food may
easily be inferred: first, because otherwise the prayer would be
defective and incomplete. We are enjoined, in many passages, to throw
all our cares into the bosom of God, and he graciously promises, that
*“*he will withhold from us no good thing,” (<span
id="ix.liv-p38.1"></span>[Ps
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011)<span id="ix.liv-p38.1"></span>..md)
In a perfect rule of prayer, therefore, some direction must be laid down
as to the innumerable wants of the present life. Besides, the word <span
id="ix.liv-p38.2"></span>σήμερον*, today,* means that we are to ask from
God no more than is necessary for the day:  <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) for there is no doubt, that he
intended to restrain and guide our desire of earthly food, to which we
are all immoderately addicted. Again, a very frequent Synecdoche occurs
in the word *bread,* under which the Hebrews include every description
of food. But here it has a still more extensive meaning: for we ask not
only that the hand of God may supply us with food, but that we may
receive all that is necessary for the present life.

<span id="ix.liv-p40"></span>The meaning is now obvious. We are first
commanded to pray, that God would protect and cherish the life which he
has given to us in the world, and, as we need many supports, that he
would supply us with every thing that he knows to be needful. Now, as
the kindness of God flows in uninterrupted succession to feed us, the
bread which he bestows is called <span
id="ix.liv-p40.1"></span>ἐπιούσιος, that is, continual:  <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) for so it may be rendered. This word
suggests to us such a petition as the following: “O Lord, since our life
needs every day new supplies, may it please thee to grant them to us
without interruption.” The adverb *today,* as I said a little ago, is
added to restrain our excessive desire, and to teach us, that we depend
*every* moment on the kindness of God, and ought to be content with that
portion which he gives us, to use a common expression, “from day to
day.”

<span id="ix.liv-p42"></span>But here an objection may be urged. It is
certain, that Christ has given a rule for prayer, which belongs equally
to all the godly. Now, some of their number are rich men, who have their
yearly produce laid up in store. Why does he command them to ask what
they have at home, and to ask every day those things of which they have
an abundant supply for a year? The reply is easy. These words remind us
that, unless God feed us daily, the largest accumulation of the
necessaries of life will be of no avail. Though we may have abundance of
corn, and wine, and every thing else, unless they are watered by the
secret blessing of God, they will suddenly vanish, or we will be
deprived of the use of them, or they will lose their natural power to
support us, so that we shall famish in the midst of plenty. There is
therefore no reason to wonder, if Christ invites the rich and poor
indiscriminately to apply to their Heavenly Father for the supply of
their wants. No man will sincerely offer such a prayer as this, unless
he has learned, by the example of the Apostle Paul, “to be full and to
be hungry, to abound and to suffer need,” (<span
id="ix.liv-p42.1"></span>[Php
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012)<span id="ix.liv-p42.1"></span>,.md)
to endure patiently his poverty or his humble condition, and not to be
intoxicated by a false confidence in his abundance.

<span id="ix.liv-p43"></span>Does any one inquire, why we ask that bread
to be given to us, which we call *OUR bread?* I answer: It is so called,
not because it belongs to us by right, but because the fatherly kindness
of God has set it apart for our use. It becomes *ours,* because our
Heavenly Father freely bestows it on us for the supply of our
necessities. The fields must, no doubt, be cultivated, labor must be
bestowed on gathering the fruits of the earth, and every man must submit
to the toil of his calling, in order to procure food. But all this does
not hinder us from being fed by the undeserved kindness of God, without
which men might waste their strength to no purpose. We are thus taught,
that what we seem to have acquired by our own industry is his gift. We
may likewise infer from this word, that, if we wish God to feed us, we
must not take what belongs to others: for all who have been *taught of
God,* (<span id="ix.liv-p43.1"></span>[Joh
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045)<span id="ix.liv-p43.1"></span>,.md)
whenever they employ this form of prayer, make a declaration that they
desire nothing but what is their own.

<span id="ix.liv-p44"></span><span id="ix.liv-p44.1"></span>

<span id="ix.liv-p45"></span>**12.** *And forgive us our debts* Here it
may be proper that we should be reminded of what I said a little before,
that Christ, in arranging the prayers of his people, did not consider
which was first or second in order. It is written, that our prayers are
as it were a wall which hinders our approach to God, (<span
id="ix.liv-p45.1"></span>[Isa
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002)<span id="ix.liv-p45.1"></span>,.md)
or a cloud which prevents him from beholding us, (<span
id="ix.liv-p45.2"></span>[Isa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022)<span id="ix.liv-p45.2"></span>,.md)
and that

<span id="ix.liv-p46"></span>“he hath covered himself with a cloud, that
our  
prayer should not pass through,” (<span id="ix.liv-p46.2"></span>[La
3:44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044)<span id="ix.liv-p46.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.liv-p47"></span>We ought always, therefore, to begin with
the forgiveness of sins: for the first hope of being heard by God beams
upon us, when we obtain his favor; and there is no way in which he is
*“*pacified toward us,” (<span id="ix.liv-p47.1"></span>[Eze
16:63](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#063)<span id="ix.liv-p47.1"></span>,.md)
but by freely pardoning our sins. Christ has included in two petitions
all that related to the eternal salvation of the soul, and to the
spiritual life: for these are the two leading points of the divine
covenant, in which all our salvation consists. He offers to us a free
reconciliation by *“*not imputing our sins,” (<span
id="ix.liv-p47.2"></span>[2Co
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)<span id="ix.liv-p47.2"></span>,.md)
and promises the Spirit, to engrave the righteousness of the law on our
hearts. We are commanded to ask both, and the prayer for obtaining the
forgiveness of sins is placed first.

<span id="ix.liv-p48"></span>In Matthew, sins are called *debts,*
because they expose us to condemnation at the tribunal of God*,* and
make us *debtors;* nay more, they alienate us entirely from God, so that
there is no hope of obtaining peace and favor except by pardon. And so
is fulfilled what Paul tells us, that *“*all have sinned, and come short
of the glory of God,” (<span id="ix.liv-p48.1"></span>[Ro
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023)<span id="ix.liv-p48.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="ix.liv-p49"></span>*“*that every mouth may be stopped, and all
the  
world may become guilty before God,” (<span id="ix.liv-p49.2"></span>[Ro
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019)<span id="ix.liv-p49.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.liv-p50"></span>For, though the righteousness of God
shines, to some extent, in the saints, yet, so long as they are
surrounded by the flesh, they lie under the burden of sins. None will be
found so pure as not to need the mercy of God, and if we wish to partake
of it, we must feel our wretchedness. Those who dream of attaining such
perfection in this world, as to be free from every spot and blemish, not
only renounce their sins, but renounce Christ himself, from whose Church
they banish themselves. For*,* when he commands all his disciples to
betake themselves to him daily for the forgiveness of sins, every one,
who thinks that he has no need of such a remedy, is struck out of the
number of the disciples.

<span id="ix.liv-p51"></span>Now, the forgiveness, which we here ask to
be bestowed on us, is inconsistent with satisfaction, by which the world
endeavors to purchase its own deliverance. For that creditor is not said
to *forgive,* who has received payment and asks nothing more,—but he who
willingly and generously departs from his just claim, and frees the
*debtor* The ordinary distinction between *crime* and *punishment* has
no place here: for *debts* unquestionably mean liability to punishment.
If they are freely forgiven us, all compensations must disappear. And
there is no other meaning than this in the passage of Luke, though he
calls them *sins:* for in no other way does God grant the pardon of
them, than by removing the condemnation which they deserve.

<span id="ix.liv-p52"></span>*As we forgive our debtors* This condition
is added, that no one may presume to approach God and ask forgiveness,
who is not pure and free from all resentment. And yet the forgiveness,
which we ask that God would give us, does not depend on the forgiveness
which we grant to others: but the design of Christ was, to exhort us, in
this manner, to forgive the offenses which have been committed against
us, and at the same time, to give, as it were, the impression of his
seal, to ratify the confidence in our own forgiveness. Nor is any thing
inconsistent with this in the phrase used by Luke, <span
id="ix.liv-p52.1"></span>καὶ γὰρ, for *we also* Christ did not intend to
point out the cause, but only to remind us of the feelings which we
ought to cherish towards brethren, when we desire to be reconciled to
God. And certainly, if the Spirit of God reigns in our hearts, every
description of ill-will and revenge ought to be banished. The Spirit is
the *witness* of our adoption, (<span id="ix.liv-p52.2"></span>[Ro
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016)<span id="ix.liv-p52.2"></span>,.md)
and therefore this is put down simply as a mark, to distinguish the
children of God from strangers. The name *debtors* is here given, not to
those who owe us money, or any other service, but to those who are
*indebted to us* on account of offenses which they have committed.

<span id="ix.liv-p53"></span><span id="ix.liv-p53.1"></span>

<span id="ix.liv-p54"></span>**13.** *And lead us not into temptation*
Some people have split this petition into two. This is wrong: for the
nature of the subject makes it manifest, that it is one and the same
petition. The connection of the words also shows it: for the word *but,*
which is placed between, connects the two clauses together, as Augustine
judiciously explains. The sentence ought to be resolved thus, *That we
may not be led into temptation, deliver us from evil* The meaning is:
“We are conscious Of our own weakness, and desire to enjoy the
protection of God, that we may remain impregnable against all the
assaults of Satan.” We showed from the former petition, that no man can
be reckoned a Christian, who does not acknowledge himself to be a
sinner; and in the same manner, we conclude from this petition, that we
have no strength for living a holy life, except so far as we obtain it
from God. Whoever implores the assistance of God to overcome
temptations, acknowledges that, unless God *deliver* him, he will be
constantly falling.  <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md)

<span id="ix.liv-p56"></span>The word *temptation* is often used
generally for any kind of trial. In this sense God is said to have
*tempted Abraham,* (<span id="ix.liv-p56.1"></span>[Ge
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001)<span id="ix.liv-p56.1"></span>,.md)
when he tried his faith. We are *tempted* both by adversity and by
prosperity: because each of them is an occasion of bringing to light
feelings which were formerly concealed. But here it denotes inward
*temptation,* which may be fitly called the scourge of the devil, for
exciting our lust. It would be foolish to ask, that God would keep us
free from every thing which makes trial of our faith. All wicked
emotions, which excite us to sin, are included under the name of
*temptation* Though it is not impossible that we may feel such pricks in
our minds, (for, during the whole course of our life, we have a constant
warfare with the flesh,) yet we ask that the Lord would not cause us to
be thrown down, or suffer us to be overwhelmed, by *temptations*

<span id="ix.liv-p57"></span>In order to express this truth more
clearly, that we are liable to constant stumbling and ruinous falls, if
God does not uphold us with his hand, Christ used this form of
expression, *(*<span id="ix.liv-p57.1"></span>μὴ εἰσενέγκὟς*,) Lead us
not into temptation:* or, as some render it, *Bring us not into
temptation* It is certainly true, that “every man is tempted,” as the
Apostle James says, (<span id="ix.liv-p57.2"></span>[Jas
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014)<span id="ix.liv-p57.2"></span>.md)
“by his own lust:” yet, as God not only gives us up to the will of
Satan, to kindle the flame of lust, but employs him as the agent of his
wrath, when he chooses to drive men headlong to destruction, he may be
also said, in a way peculiar to himself, to *lead them into temptation*
In the same sense, “an evil spirit from the Lord” is said to have
*“*seized or troubled Saul,” (<span id="ix.liv-p57.3"></span>[1Sa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014)<span id="ix.liv-p57.3"></span>:.md)
and there are many passages of Scripture to the same purpose. And yet we
will not therefore say, that God is the author of evil: because, by
giving men over to a reprobate mind,” (<span
id="ix.liv-p57.4"></span>[Ro 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)<span
id="ix.liv-p57.4"></span>,) he does not exercise a confused tyranny, but
executes his just, though secret  <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) judgments.

<span id="ix.liv-p59"></span>*Deliver us from evil* The word *evil*
(<span id="ix.liv-p59.1"></span>πονηροῦ) may either be taken in the
neuter gender, as signifying *the evil thing,* or in the masculine
gender, as signifying *the evil one* *Chrysostom* refers it to the
Devil, who is the contriver of every thing evil, and, as the deadly
enemy of our salvation, is continually fighting against us.  <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) But it may, with equal propriety, be
explained as referring to *sin* There is no necessity for raising a
debate on this point: for the meaning remains nearly the same, that we
are in danger from the devil and from sin, if the Lord does not protect
and *deliver* us.

<span id="ix.liv-p61"></span>*For thine is the kingdom* It is surprising
that this clause, which agrees so well with the rest of the prayer, has
been left out by the Latins:  <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md)
for it was not added merely for the purpose of kindling our hearts to
seek the glory of God, and of reminding us what ought to be the object
of our prayers; but likewise to teach us, that our prayers, which are
here dictated to us, are founded on God alone, that we may not rely on
our own merits.

“succeeding, or coming by each day.” We subjoin an extract from the
Dissertations of *Witsius* on the Lord‘s Prayer. After mentioning
several views of Commentators on this petition, he says: This great
variety of expositions has been principally occasioned by the Greek word
ἐπιούσιος. That word occurs nowhere else in Scripture, and the most
learned men have been unable to discover it in any profane writings. As
it is not known to what Hebrew word employed by our Lord it corresponds,
it is not surprising that different persons should have assigned to it
different acceptations. — I shall not now enter into a critical
examination of the very numerous expositions of that word which have
been given by learned men. An exposition more copious and learned than
any that had previously appeared, has been given by a very celebrated
and learned man, JOHN MARCK, formerly my much esteemed colleague in the
University of Friesland. It forms a part of his *Juvenile
Dissertations,* as he is pleased to style them, but which contain much
profound wisdom. The simplest and most probable of the various
etymologies, I have always thought, is that which supposes ἐπιόσιος to
be compounded of ἐπὶ and οὐσία*,* as περιούσιος is compounded of περὶ
and οὐσία The analogy of composition of such words presents no
difficulty: for it does not require that the ι in the word ἐπὶ shall be
dropped before a vowel. This is proved by the words ἐπιεικὴς, ἐπιόγδοος,
ἐπιόρκος, ἐπιόπτομαι, ἐπιοῦρος, and many of the same form. This
derivation being granted, which has nothing unusual or anomalous,
considerable progress has been made in the investigation of the subject.
For as τὸ περιούσιον signifies *what is more than enough,* and beyond
what the preservation of existence requires, so τὸ ἐπιούσιον signifies
what is enough. Such is the meaning assigned to it by the ancient Greek
writers, who were deeply skilled in their own language. “ ́̓Αρτου
ἐπιούσιον, (says Chrysostom, Hom. 30, Ton. 5.) τουτέστιν ἐπὶ τὴν οὐσίαν
τοῦ σώματος διαζαίνοντα, καὶ συγκρατὢσαι ταύτην δυνάμενον, — “that is,
what passes *to the substance* of the body, and is able to support it.”
Ζητεῖν προσετάχθημεν *,* (says Gregory Nyssen,) τὸ πρὸν τὴν συντήρησιν
ἐξαρκοῦν τὢν σωματικὢν οὐσίαν “We have been commanded to seek what is
sufficient for the support of the bodily existence.” Basil explains it
to be τὸν πρὸς τὴν ἐφήμερον ζωὴν τὢ οὐσία ἡμῶν χρησιμεύοντα, “what is
useful to our existence for daily life.” (After referring to *Suiceri
Thesaurus,* and quoting from Cyril of Alexandria and from Theodoret, he
concludes ἄρτον ἐπιούσιον to be equivalent to the phrase used by the
Apostle James, (<span id="ix.liv-p41.3"></span>[Jas

ὑπερζολὴν τὢς κακίας, καὶ ἐπειδὰν μηδὲν παρ ᾿ ἡμῶν ἀδικηθεὶς ἄσπονδον
πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἔχει τὸυ πόλεμον. “He calls *the Devil,* in this place, THE
EVIL ONE. He is, by way of eminence, so called, on account of his
superlative wickedness, and because, though he has received no injury
from us, he carries on against us an implacable war.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_443"></span>[444](cc31062.htm#fr_443.md) <span
id="ix.liv-p61.1"></span>

<span id="ix.liv-p62"></span> That part of the Lord's Prayer, which we
commonly call *the conclusion,* is not found in the Gospel by Luke, and
its genuineness has been questioned. None of the Latin copies (as Calvin
mentions) have it: but even those who have most zealously maintained
that it is spurious, admit that it exists in the greater number of the
Greek manuscripts. Erasmus, Grotius, Witsius, Griesbach, Matthaei, and
Scholz, may be consulted by those who wish to examine the question for
themselves, and to hear all that has been said on both sides. Any thing
like the summing up of the argument here would exceed the limits of a
note. — *Ed.*
