<span id="ix.xli-p12"></span>**<span id="ix.xli-p12.2"></span>[Matthew
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.xli-p12.2"></span>.**
*He went up into a mountain.* Those who think that Christ’s sermon,
which is here related, is different from the sermon contained in the
sixth chapter of Luke’s Gospel, rest their opinion on a very light and
frivolous argument. Matthew states, that Christ spoke to his disciples
on a mountain, while Luke seems to say, that the discourse was delivered
on a plain. But it is a mistake to read the words of Luke, *he went down
with them, and stood in the plain,* (<span id="ix.xli-p12.3"></span>[Lu
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017)<span id="ix.xli-p12.3"></span>,.md)
as immediately connected with the statement that, *lifting up his eyes
on the disciples,* he spoke thus. For the design of both Evangelists
was, to collect into one place the leading points of the doctrine of
Christ, which related to a devout and holy life. Although Luke had
previously mentioned a *plain,* he does not observe the immediate
succession of events in the history, but passes from miracles to
doctrine, without pointing out either time or place: just as Matthew
takes no notice of the time, but only mentions the place. It is
probable, that this discourse was not delivered until Christ had chosen
the twelve: but in attending to the order of time, which I saw that the
Spirit of God had disregarded, I did not wish to be too precise. Pious
and modest readers ought to be satisfied with having a brief summary of
the doctrine of Christ placed before their eyes, collected out of his
many and various discourses, the first of which was that in which he
spoke to his disciples about true happiness.

<span id="ix.xli-p13"></span><span id="ix.xli-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p14"></span>**2.** *Opening his mouth.* This redundancy
of expression (<span id="ix.xli-p14.1"></span>πλεονασμὸς) partakes of
the Hebrew idiom: for what would be faulty in other languages is
frequent among the Hebrews, to say, *He opened his mouth,* instead of,
*He began to speak.* Many look upon it as an emphatic mode of
expression, employed to draw attention to any thing important and
remarkable, either in a good or bad sense, which has been uttered: but
as some passages of Scripture countenance an opposite view, I prefer the
former exposition. I shall also dismiss the ingenious speculation of
those, who give an allegorical turn to the fact of our Lord teaching his
disciples on a mountain, as if it had been intended to teach them to
elevate their minds far above worldly cares and employments. In
ascending the mountain, his design rather was to seek a retreat, where
he might obtain relaxation for himself and his disciples at a distance
from the multitude.

<span id="ix.xli-p15"></span>Now let us see, in the first place, why
Christ spoke to his disciples about *true happiness.* We know that not
only the great body of the people, but even the learned themselves, hold
this error, that he is the happy man who is free from annoyance, attains
all his wishes, and leads a joyful and easy life. At least it is the
general opinion, that happiness ought to be estimated from the present
state.  <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) Christ, therefore, in
order to accustom his own people to bear the cross, exposes this
mistaken opinion, that those are happy who lead an easy and prosperous
life according to the flesh. For it is impossible that men should mildly
bend the neck to bear calamities and reproaches, so long as they think
that patience is at variance with a happy life. The only consolation
which mitigates and even sweetens the bitterness of the cross and of all
afflictions, is the conviction, that we are happy in the midst of
miseries: for our patience is *blessed* by the Lord, and will soon be
followed by a happy result.

<span id="ix.xli-p17"></span>This doctrine, I do acknowledge, is widely
removed from the common opinion: but the disciples of Christ must learn
the philosophy of placing their happiness beyond the world, and above
the affections of the flesh. Though carnal reason will never admit what
is here taught by Christ, yet he does not bring forward any thing
imaginary, — as the Stoics  <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) were
wont, in ancient times, to amuse themselves with their paradoxes, — but
demonstrates from the fact, that those persons are truly happy, whose
condition is supposed to be miserable. Let us, therefore remember, that
the leading object of the discourse is to show, that those are not
unhappy who are oppressed by the reproaches of the wicked, and subject
to various calamities. And not only does Christ prove that they are in
the wrong, who measure the happiness of man by the present state,
because the distresses of the godly will soon be changed for the better;
but he also exhorts his own people to patience, by holding out the hope
of a reward.

<span id="ix.xli-p19"></span><span id="ix.xli-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p20"></span>**3.** *Happy are the poor in spirit.*
**<span id="ix.xli-p20.2"></span>[Luke
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md)<span id="ix.xli-p20.2"></span>.**
*Happy (are ye) poor.* Luke gives nothing more than a simple metaphor:
but as the poverty of many is accursed and unhappy, Matthew expresses
more clearly the intention of Christ. Many are pressed down by
distresses, and yet continue to swell inwardly with pride and cruelty.
But Christ pronounces those to be happy who, chastened and subdued by
afflictions, submit themselves wholly to God, and, with inward humility,
betake themselves to him for protection. Others explain *the poor in
spirit* to be those who claim nothing for themselves, and are even so
completely emptied of confidence in the flesh, that they acknowledge
their poverty. But as the words of Luke and those of Matthew must have
the same meaning, there can be no doubt that the appellation *poor* is
here given to those who are pressed and afflicted by adversity. The only
difference is, that Matthew, by adding an epithet, confines the
happiness to those only who, under the discipline of the cross, have
learned to be humble.

<span id="ix.xli-p21"></span>*For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.* We
see that Christ does not swell the minds of his own people by any
unfounded belief, or harden them by unfeeling obstinacy, as the Stoics
do, but leads them to entertain the hope of eternal life, and animates
them to patience by assuring them, that in this way they will pass into
the heavenly kingdom of God. It deserves our attention, that he only who
is reduced to nothing in himself, and relies on the mercy of God, is
*poor in spirit:* for they who are broken or overwhelmed by despair
murmur against God, and this proves them to be of a proud and haughty
*spirit.*

<span id="ix.xli-p22"></span><span id="ix.xli-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p23"></span>**4.** *Happy are they that mourn.* This
statement is closely connected with the preceding one, and is a sort of
appendage or confirmation of it. The ordinary belief is, that calamities
render a man unhappy. This arises from the consideration, that they
constantly bring along with them *mourning* and grief. Now, nothing is
supposed to be more inconsistent with happiness than *mourning.* But
Christ does not merely affirm that *mourners* are not unhappy. He shows,
that their very *mourning* contributes to a *happy* life, by preparing
them to receive eternal joy, and by furnishing them with excitements to
seek true *comfort* in God alone. Accordingly, Paul says,

<span id="ix.xli-p24"></span>“We glory in tribulations also knowing that
tribulation produces patience, and patience experience, and experience
hope: and hope maketh not ashamed,” (<span id="ix.xli-p24.1"></span>[Ro
5:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003)<span id="ix.xli-p24.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xli-p25"></span><span id="ix.xli-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p26"></span>**5.** *Happy are the meek* By *the meek*
he means persons of mild and gentle dispositions, who are not easily
provoked by injuries, who are not ready to take offense, but are
prepared to endure anything rather than do the like actions to wicked
men. When Christ promises to such persons *the inheritance of the
earth,* we might think it exceedingly foolish. Those who warmly repel
any attacks, and whose hand is ever ready to revenge injuries, are
rather the persons who claim for themselves the dominion of the earth.
And experience certainly shows that, the more mildly their wickedness is
endured, the more bold and insolent does it become. Hence arises the
diabolical proverb, that “We must howl with the wolves, because the
wolves will immediately devour every one who makes himself a sheep.” But
Christ places his own protection, and that of the Father, in contrast
with the fury and violence of wicked men, and declares, on good grounds,
that *the meek* will be the lords and *heirs of the earth* The children
of this world never think themselves safe, but when they fiercely
revenge the injuries that are done them, and defend their life by the
“weapons of war,” (<span id="ix.xli-p26.1"></span>[Eze
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027)<span id="ix.xli-p26.1"></span>..md)
But as we must believe, that Christ alone is the guardian of our life,
all that remains for us is to “hide ourselves under the shadow of his
wings,” (<span id="ix.xli-p26.2"></span>[Ps
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008)<span id="ix.xli-p26.2"></span>..md)
We must be sheep, if we wish to be reckoned a part of his flock.

<span id="ix.xli-p27"></span>It will perhaps be objected, that what has
been now said is contradicted by experience. I would first suggest that
it be considered, how greatly ferocious  <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) people are disturbed by their own
restlessness. While they lead so stormy a life, though they were a
hundred times lords of the earth, while they possess all, they certainly
possess nothing. For the children of God, on the other hand, I answer,
that though they may not plant their foot on what is their own, they
enjoy a quiet residence on the earth. And this is no imaginary
possession;  <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) for they know, that
the earth, which they inhabit, has been granted to them by God. Besides,
the hand of God is interposed to protect them against the violence and
fury of wicked men. Though exposed to every species of attack, subject
to the malice of wicked men, surrounded by all kinds of danger, they are
safe under the divine protection. They have already a foretaste, at
least, of this grace of God; and that is enough for them, till they
enter, at the last day, into the possession of the *inheritance*  <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) of the world.

<span id="ix.xli-p31"></span><span id="ix.xli-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p32"></span>**6.** *Happy are they who hunger* To
*hunger and thirst* is here, I think, used as a figurative expression,
 <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) and means to suffer poverty, to
want the necessaries of life, and even to be defrauded of one’s right.
Matthew says, *who thirst after righteousness,* and thus makes one class
stand for all the rest. He represents more strongly the unworthy
treatment which they have received, when he says that, though they are
anxious, though they groan, they desire nothing but what is proper.
“Happy are they who, though their wishes are so moderate, that they
desire nothing to be granted to them but what is reasonable, are yet in
a languishing condition, like persons who are famishing with hunger.”
Though their distressing anxiety exposes them to the ridicule of others,
yet it is a certain preparation for *happiness:* for at length *they
shall be satisfied* God will one day listen to their groans, and satisfy
their just desires for to Him, as we learn from the song of the Virgin,
it belongs to *fill the hungry with good things,* (<span
id="ix.xli-p33.2"></span>[Lu 1:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#053.md)<span
id="ix.xli-p33.2"></span>.)

<span id="ix.xli-p34"></span><span id="ix.xli-p34.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p35"></span>**7.** *Happy are the merciful* This
paradox, too, contradicts the judgment of men.  <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) The world reckons those men to be
*happy,* who give themselves no concern about the distresses of others,
but consult their own ease. Christ says that those are *happy,* who are
not only prepared to endure their own afflictions, but to take a share
in the afflictions of others, — who assist the wretched, — who willingly
take part with those who are in distress, — who clothe themselves, as it
were, with the same affections, that they may be more readily disposed
to render them assistance. He adds, *for they shall obtain mercy,* — not
only with God, but also among men, whose minds God will dispose to the
exercise of humanity.  <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) Though
the whole world may sometimes be ungrateful, and may return the very
worst reward to those who have done acts of kindness to them, it ought
to be reckoned enough, that grace is laid up with God for the merciful
and humane, so that they, in their turn, will find him to be *gracious
and merciful,* (<span id="ix.xli-p37.2"></span>[Ps.
103:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#008.md), [Ps.
145:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008)<span id="ix.xli-p37.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xli-p38"></span><span id="ix.xli-p38.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p39"></span>**8.** *Happy are they who are of a pure
heart* We might be apt to think, that what is here stated by Christ is
in accordance with the judgment of all. *Purity of heart* is universally
acknowledged to be the mother of all virtues. And yet there is hardly
one person in a hundred, who does not put craftiness in the place of the
greatest virtue. Hence those persons are commonly accounted *happy,*
whose ingenuity is exercised in the successful practice of deceit, who
gain dexterous advantages, by indirect means, over those with whom they
have intercourse. Christ does not at all agree with carnal reason, when
he pronounces those to be *happy,* who take no delight in cunning, but
converse sincerely with men, and express nothing, by word or look, which
they do not feel in their heart. Simple people are ridiculed for want of
caution, and for not looking sharply enough to themselves. But Christ
directs them to higher views, and bids them consider that, if they have
not sagacity to deceive in this world, they will enjoy *the sight of
God* in heaven.

<span id="ix.xli-p40"></span><span id="ix.xli-p40.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p41"></span>**9.** *Happy are the peacemakers* By
*peacemakers* he means those who not only seek peace and avoid quarrels,
as far as lies in their power, but who also labor to settle differences
among others, who advise all men to live at peace, and take away every
occasion of hatred and strife. There are good grounds for this
statement. As it is a laborious and irksome employment to reconcile
those who are at variance, persons of a mild disposition, who study to
promote peace, are compelled to endure the indignity of hearing
reproaches, complaints, and remonstrances on all sides. The reason is,
that every one would desire to have advocates, who would defend his
cause. That we may not depend on the favor of men, Christ bids us look
up to the judgment of his Father, who is *the God of peace,* (<span
id="ix.xli-p41.1"></span>[Ro
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033)<span id="ix.xli-p41.1"></span>,.md)
and who accounts us his children, while we cultivate peace, though our
endeavors may not be acceptable to men: for *to be called* means *To Be
Accounted* *the children of God*

<span id="ix.xli-p42"></span><span id="ix.xli-p42.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p43"></span>**10.** *Happy are they who suffer
persecution* The disciples of Christ have very great need of this
instruction; and the more hard and disagreeable it is for the flesh to
admit it, the more earnestly ought we to make it the subject of our
meditation. We cannot be Christ’s soldiers  <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) on any other condition, than to have
the greater part of the world rising in hostility against us, and
pursuing us even to death. The state of the matter is this. Satan, the
prince of the world, will never cease to fill his followers with rage,
to carry on hostilities against the members of Christ. It is, no doubt,
monstrous and unnatural, that men, who study to live a righteous life,
should be attacked and tormented in a way which they do not deserve. And
so Peter says,

<span id="ix.xli-p45"></span>“Who is he that will harm you,  
if ye be followers of that which is good?”  
(<span id="ix.xli-p45.3"></span>[1Pe
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#013)<span id="ix.xli-p45.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xli-p46"></span>Yet, in consequence of the unbridled
wickedness of the world, it too frequently happens, that good men,
through a zeal of righteousness, arouse against them the resentments of
the ungodly. Above all, it is, as we may say, the ordinary lot of
Christians to be hated by the majority of men: for the flesh cannot
endure the doctrine of the Gospel; none can endure to have their vices
reproved.

<span id="ix.xli-p47"></span>*Who suffer on account of righteousness*
This is descriptive of those who inflame the hatred, and provoke the
rage, of wicked men against them, because, through an earnest desire to
do what is good and right, they oppose bad causes and defend good ones,
as far as lies in their power. Now, in this respect, the truth of God
justly holds the first rank. Accordingly, by this mark Christ
distinguishes his own martyrs from criminals and malefactors.

<span id="ix.xli-p48"></span>I now return to what I said a little
before, that as, all that will live godly in Christ Jesus “(Paul informs
us), shall suffer persecution,” (<span id="ix.xli-p48.1"></span>[2Ti
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012)<span id="ix.xli-p48.1"></span>,.md)
this admonition has a general reference to all the godly. But if, at any
time, the Lord spares our weakness, and does not permit the ungodly to
torment us as they would desire, yet, during the season of repose and
leisure, it is proper for us to meditate on this doctrine, that we may
be ready, whenever it shall be necessary, to enter the field, and may
not engage in the contest till we have been well prepared. As the
condition of the godly, during the whole course of this life, is very
miserable, Christ properly calls them to the hope of the heavenly life.
And here lies the main difference between Christ’s paradox and the
ravings of the Stoics, who ordered that every man should be satisfied in
his own mind, and should be the author of his own happiness: while
Christ does not suspend our happiness on a vain imagination, but rests
it on the hope of a future reward.

<span id="ix.xli-p49"></span><span id="ix.xli-p49.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p50"></span>**11.** *When they shall cast reproaches on
you* **<span id="ix.xli-p50.2"></span>[Luke
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022.md)<span id="ix.xli-p50.2"></span>**
*When men shall hate you, and separate you, and load you with
reproaches, and cast out your name as evil* By these words Christ
intended to comfort those who believe in him; that they may not lose
courage, even though they see themselves to be detestable in the eyes of
the world. For this was no light temptation, to be thrown out of the
Church as ungodly and profane. Christ knew that there is no class of men
more envenomed than hypocrites, and foresaw with what furious madness
the enemies of the Gospel would attack his small and despised flock. It
was therefore his will to furnish them with a sure defense, that they
might not give way, though an immense mass of reproaches were ready to
overwhelm them. And hence it appears, how little reason there is to
dread the excommunication of the Pope, when those tyrants banish us from
their synagogues, because we are unwilling to renounce Christ.

<span id="ix.xli-p51"></span><span id="ix.xli-p51.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p52"></span>**12.** *Rejoice ye, and leap for joy* The
meaning is, a remedy is at hand, that we may not be overwhelmed by
unjust reproaches: for, as soon as we raise our minds to heaven, we
there behold vast grounds of joy, which dispel sadness. The idle
reasonings of the Papists, about the word *reward,* which is here used,
are easily refuted: for there is not (as they dream) a mutual relation
between the reward and merit, but the promise of the *reward* is free.
Besides, if we consider the imperfections and faults of any good works
that are done by the very best of men, there will be no work which God
can judge to be worthy of reward.

<span id="ix.xli-p53"></span>We must advert once more to the phrases,
*on my account,* or, *on account of the Son of Man,* (<span
id="ix.xli-p53.1"></span>[Lu 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022.md)<span
id="ix.xli-p53.1"></span>;) and *lying, shall speak every evil word
against you;* that he who suffers persecution for his own fault (<span
id="ix.xli-p53.2"></span>[1Pe
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020)<span id="ix.xli-p53.2"></span>.md)
may not forthwith boast that he is a martyr of Christ, as the Donatists,
in ancient times, were delighted with themselves on this single ground,
that the magistrates were against them. And in our own day the
Anabaptists,  <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) while they disturb
the Church by their ravings, and slander the Gospel, boast that they are
carrying the banners of Christ, when they are justly condemned. But
Christ pronounces those only to be happy who are employed in defending a
righteous cause.

<span id="ix.xli-p55"></span>*For so did they persecute* This was
expressly added, that the apostles might not expect to triumph without
exertion and without a contest, and might not fail, when they
encountered persecutions. The restoration of all things, under the reign
of Christ, being everywhere promised in Scripture, there was danger,
lest they might not think of warfare, but indulge in vain and proud
confidence. It is evident from other passages, that they foolishly
imagined the kingdom of Christ to be filled with wealth and luxuries.
 <span id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) Christ had good reason for
warning them, that, as soon as they succeeded to the place of the
prophets, they must sustain the same contests in which the prophets were
formerly engaged. *The prophets who were before you* This means not
only, that *the prophets were before them* with respect to the order of
time, but that they were of the same class with themselves, and ought
therefore to be followed as their example. The notion commonly
entertained, of making out nine distinct beatitudes, is too frivolous to
need a long refutation.

<span id="ix.xli-p57"></span><span id="ix.xli-p57.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p58"></span>**<span id="ix.xli-p58.2"></span>[Luke
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md)<span id="ix.xli-p58.2"></span>.**
*Woe to you that are rich.* As Luke has related not more than four kinds
of *blessings,* so he now contrasts with them four *curses,* so that the
clauses mutually correspond. This contrast not only tends to strike
terror into the ungodly, but to arouse believers, that they may not be
lulled to sleep by the vain and deceitful allurements of the world. We
know how prone men are to be intoxicated by prosperity, or ensnared by
flattery; and on this account the children of God often envy the
reprobate, when they see everything go on prosperously and smoothly with
them.

<span id="ix.xli-p59"></span>He pronounces a curse on the *rich*, — not
on all the rich, but on those who *receive their consolation* in the
world; that is, who are so completely occupied with their worldly
possessions, that they forget the life to come. The meaning is: riches
are so far from making a man happy, that they often become the means of
his destruction. In any other point of view, the rich are not excluded
from the kingdom of heaven, provided they do not become snares for
themselves, or fix their hope on the earth, so as to shut against them
the kingdom of heaven. This is finely illustrated by Augustine, who, in
order to show that riches are not in themselves a hindrance to the
children of God, reminds his readers that poor Lazarus was received into
the bosom of rich Abraham.

<span id="ix.xli-p61"></span>**25.** *Woe to you who are filled. Woe to
you who laugh now* In the same sense, he pronounces a curse on those who
are *satiated and full:* because they are lifted up by confidence in the
blessings of the present life, and reject those blessings which are of a
heavenly nature. A similar view must be taken of what he says about
*laughter:* for by those who *laugh* he means those who have given
themselves up to Epicurean mirth, who are plunged in carnal pleasures,
and spurn every kind of trouble which would be found necessary for
maintaining the glory of God.

<span id="ix.xli-p62"></span><span id="ix.xli-p62.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p63"></span>**26.** *Woe to you when all men shall
applaud you* The last woe is intended to correct ambition: for nothing
is more common than to seek the applauses of men, or, at least, to be
carried away by them; and, in order to guard his disciples against such
a course, he points out to them that the favor of men would prove to be
their ruin. This warning refers peculiarly to teachers, who have no
plague more to be dreaded than ambition: because it is impossible for
them not to corrupt the pure doctrine of God, when they, “seek to please
men,” (<span id="ix.xli-p63.1"></span>[Ga
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)<span id="ix.xli-p63.1"></span>..md)
By the phrase, *all men,* Christ must be understood to refer to the
children of the world, whose applauses are wholly bestowed on deceivers
and false prophets: for faithful and conscientious ministers of sound
doctrine enjoy the applause and favor of good men. It is only the wicked
favor of the flesh that is here condemned: for, as Paul informs us,
(<span id="ix.xli-p63.2"></span>[Ga
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)<span id="ix.xli-p63.2"></span>,.md)
no man who “seeks to please men” can be “the servant of Christ.”

the distinction between pleasure and pain is imaginary; that happiness
does not at all depend on outward circumstances; and that whoever

<span id="ix.xli-p54"></span> *The Anabaptists* here named must not be
confounded with the *Baptists* or *Anti-poedo-baptists* of the present
day, who are, indeed, at issue with Calvin as to the subjects and mode
of baptism, but who utterly disown the *Anabaptists* of the sixteenth
century. Our notes are restricted by the plan of this work to the
elucidation of our author, and to matters of criticism and history. It
would, therefore, be out of place to enter here into the merits of a
doctrinal controversy, or to vindicate brethren from the heavy charge
which is here implied. But we are at liberty to say, that against them
Calvin brings no such charge. Nowhere does he represent a departure from
his views on the ordinance of Baptism as a fundamental error, or as
necessarily connected with danger to society. He alludes to sentiments,
which were openly avowed by the *Anabaptists,* and which he viewed as
striking at the root of civil government. To any one at all conversant
with their history, the name instantly awakens the recollections of
*Munster,* and of the enormities which were perpetrated there, to the
disgrace of the Christian name, — enormities which none are more ready
to condemn than the esteemed brethren to whom we have referred. If we
seem to discover excessive solicitude to remove the appearance of
calumny, our apology must be found in our deep veneration for the
author, and in our conviction that he was not less distinguished by a
Catholic spirit than by the other great excellencies of his character.
Never was there a human breast, in which there dwelt a stronger
affection for all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. —
*Ed.*
