<span id="ix.xiv-p7"></span><span id="ix.xiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xiv-p8"></span>As all are not agreed about these two
genealogies, which are given by Matthew and Luke, we must first see
whether both trace the genealogy of Christ from Joseph, or whether
Matthew only traces it from Joseph, and Luke from Mary. Those who are of
this latter opinion have a plausible ground for their distinction in the
diversity of the names: and certainly, at first sight, nothing seems
more improbable than that Matthew and Luke*,* who differ so widely from
each other, give one and the same genealogy. For from David to
Salathiel, and again from Zerubbabel till Joseph, the names are totally
different.

<span id="ix.xiv-p9"></span>Again, it is alleged, that it would have
been idle to bestow so great pains on a thing of no use, in relating a
second time the genealogy of Joseph, who after all was not the father of
Christ. “Why this repetition,” say they, “which proves nothing that
contributes much to the edification of faith? If nothing more be known
than this, that Joseph was one of the descendants and family of David,
the genealogy of Christ will still remain doubtful.” In their opinion,
therefore, it would have been superfluous that two Evangelists should
apply themselves to this subject. They excuse Matthew for laying down
the ancestry of Joseph, on the ground, that he did it for the sake of
many persons, who were still of opinion that he was the father of
Christ. But it would have been foolish to hold out such an encouragement
to a dangerous error: and what follows is at total variance with the
supposition. For as soon as he comes to the close of the genealogy,
Matthew points out that Christ was conceived in the womb of the virgin,
not from the seed of Joseph, but by the secret power of the Spirit. If
their argument were good, Matthew might be charged with folly or
inadvertence, in laboring to no purpose to establish the genealogy of
Joseph.

<span id="ix.xiv-p10"></span>But we have not yet replied to their
objection, that the ancestry of Joseph has nothing to do with Christ.
The common and well-known reply is, that in the person of Joseph the
genealogy of Mary also is included, because the law enjoined every man
to marry from his own tribe. It is objected, on the other hand, that at
almost no period had that law been observed: but the arguments on which
that assertion rests are frivolous. They quote the instance of the
eleven tribes binding themselves by an oath, that they would not give a
wife to the Benjamites, (<span id="ix.xiv-p10.1"></span>[Jud
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001)<span id="ix.xiv-p10.1"></span>..md)
If this matter, say they, had been settled by law, there would have been
no need for a new enactment. I reply, this extraordinary occurrence is
erroneously and ignorantly converted by them into a general rule: for if
one tribe had been cut off, the body of the people must have been
incomplete if some remedy had not been applied to a case of extreme
necessity. We must not, therefore, look to this passage for ascertaining
the common law.

<span id="ix.xiv-p11"></span>Again, it is objected, that Mary, the
mother of Christ, was Elisabeth’s cousin, though Luke has formerly
stated that she was of the daughters of Aaron, (<span
id="ix.xiv-p11.1"></span>[Lu 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.xiv-p11.1"></span>.) The reply is easy. The daughters of the
tribe of Judah, or of any other tribe, were at liberty to marry into the
tribe of the priesthood: for they were not prevented by that reason,
which is expressed in the law, that no woman should “remove her
inheritance” to those who were of a different tribe from her own, (<span
id="ix.xiv-p11.2"></span>[Nu
36:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#006.md)<span
id="ix.xiv-p11.2"></span>.) Thus, the wife of Jehoiada, the high priest,
is declared by the sacred historian to have belonged to the royal
family, —

<span id="ix.xiv-p12"></span>“Jehoshabeath, the daughter of Jehoram,  
the wife of Jehoiada the priest,”  
(<span id="ix.xiv-p12.3"></span>[2Ch
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011)<span id="ix.xiv-p12.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p13"></span>It was, therefore, nothing wonderful or
uncommon, if the mother of Elisabeth were married to a priest. Should
any one allege, that this does not enable us to decide, with perfect
certainty, that Mary was of the same tribe with Joseph, because she was
his wife, I grant that the bare narrative, as it stands, would not prove
it without the aid of other circumstances.

<span id="ix.xiv-p14"></span>But, *in the first place,* we must observe,
that the Evangelists do not speak of events known in their own age. When
the ancestry of Joseph had been carried up as far as David, every one
could easily make out the ancestry of Mary. The Evangelists, trusting to
what was generally understood in their own day, were, no doubt, less
solicitous on that point: for, if any one entertained doubts, the
research was neither difficult nor tedious.  <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) Besides, they took for granted, that
Joseph, as a man of good character and behavior, had obeyed the
injunction of the law in marrying a wife from his own tribe. That
general rule would not, indeed, be sufficient to prove Mary’s royal
descent; for she might have belonged to the tribe of Judah, and yet not
have been a descendant of the family of David.

<span id="ix.xiv-p16"></span>My opinion is this. The Evangelists had in
their eye godly persons, who entered into no obstinate dispute, but in
the person of Joseph acknowledged the descent of Mary; particularly
since, as we have said, no doubt was entertained about it in that age.
One matter, however, might appear incredible, that this very poor and
despised couple belonged to the posterity of David, and to that royal
seed, from which the Redeemer was to spring. If any one inquire whether
or not the genealogy traced by Matthew and Luke proves clearly and
beyond controversy that Mary was descended from the family of David, I
own that it cannot be inferred with certainty; but as the relationship
between Mary and Joseph was at that time well known, the Evangelists
were more at ease on that subject. Meanwhile, it was the design of both
Evangelists to remove the stumbling-block arising from the fact, that
both Joseph and Mary were unknown, and despised, and poor, and gave not
the slightest indication of royalty.

<span id="ix.xiv-p17"></span>Again, the supposition that Luke passes by
the descent of Joseph, and relates that of Mary, is easily refuted; for
he expressly says, that *Jesus was supposed to be the son of Joseph,
etc.* Certainly, neither the father nor the grandfather of Christ is
mentioned, but the ancestry of Joseph himself is carefully explained. I
am well aware of the manner in which they attempt to solve this
difficulty. The word *son,* they allege, is put for *son-in-law,* and
the interpretation they give to Joseph being called *the son of Heli*
is, that he had married Heli’s daughter. But this does not agree with
the order of nature, and is nowhere countenanced by any example in
Scripture.

<span id="ix.xiv-p18"></span>If Solomon is struck out of Mary’s
genealogy, Christ will no longer be Christ; for all inquiry as to his
descent is founded on that solemn promise,

<span id="ix.xiv-p19"></span>“I will set up thy seed after thee; I will
establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and
he shall be my son,”  
(<span id="ix.xiv-p19.2"></span>[2Sa
7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md)<span
id="ix.xiv-p19.2"></span>.)

<span id="ix.xiv-p20"></span>“The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David;
he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy
throne,”  
(<span id="ix.xiv-p20.2"></span>[Ps
132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md)<span
id="ix.xiv-p20.2"></span>.)

<span id="ix.xiv-p21"></span>Solomon was, beyond controversy, the type
of this eternal King who was promised to David; nor can the promise be
applied to Christ, except in so far as its truth was shadowed out in
Solomon, (<span id="ix.xiv-p21.1"></span>[1Ch
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#005)<span id="ix.xiv-p21.1"></span>..md)
Now if the descent is not traced to him, how, or by what argument, shall
he be proved to be “the son of David”? Whoever expunges Solomon from
Christ’s genealogy does at the same time, obliterate and destroy those
promises by which he must be acknowledged to be the son of David. In
what way Luke, tracing the line of descent from Nathan, does not exclude
Solomon, will afterwards be seen at the proper place.

<span id="ix.xiv-p22"></span>Not to be too tedious, those two
genealogies agree substantially with each other, but we must attend to
four points of difference. The *first* is; Luke ascends by a retrograde
order, from the last to the first, while Matthew begins with the source
of the genealogy. The *second* is; Matthew does not carry his narrative
beyond the holy and elect race of Abraham,  <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) while Luke proceeds as far as Adam. The
*third* is; Matthew treats of his legal descent, and allows himself to
make some omissions in the line of ancestors, choosing to assist the
reader’s memory by arranging them under three fourteens; while Luke
follows the natural descent with greater exactness. The fourth and last
is; when they are speaking of the same persons, they sometimes give them
different names.

<span id="ix.xiv-p24"></span>It would be superfluous to say more about
the *first* point of difference, for it presents no difficulty. The
*second* is not without a very good reason: for, as God had chosen for
himself the family of Abraham, from which the Redeemer of the world
would be born, and as the promise of salvation had been, in some sort,
shut up in that family till the coming of Christ, Matthew does not pass
beyond the limits which God had prescribed. We must attend to what Paul
says,

<span id="ix.xiv-p25"></span>“that Jesus Christ was a minister of the
circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
fathers,”  
(<span id="ix.xiv-p25.2"></span>[Ro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008)<span id="ix.xiv-p25.2"></span>.md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p26"></span>with which agrees that saying of Christ,
“Salvation is of the Jews,” (<span id="ix.xiv-p26.1"></span>[Joh
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022)<span id="ix.xiv-p26.1"></span>..md)
Matthew, therefore, presents him to our contemplation as belonging to
that holy race, to which he had been expressly appointed. In Matthew’s
catalogue we must look at the covenant of God, by which he adopted the
seed of Abraham as his people, separating them, by a “middle wall of
partition,” (<span id="ix.xiv-p26.2"></span>[Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)<span id="ix.xiv-p26.2"></span>,.md)
from the rest of the nations. Luke directed his view to a higher point;
for though, from the time that God had made his covenant with Abraham, a
Redeemer was promised, in a peculiar manner, to his seed, yet we know
that, since the transgression of the first man, all needed a Redeemer,
and he was accordingly appointed for the whole world. It was by a
wonderful purpose of God, that Luke exhibited Christ to us as the son of
Adam, while Matthew confined him within the single family of Abraham.
For it would be of no advantage to us, that Christ was given by the
Father as “the author of eternal salvations” (<span
id="ix.xiv-p26.3"></span>[Heb 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.xiv-p26.3"></span>,) unless he had been given indiscriminately to
all. Besides, that saying of the Apostle would not be true, that “Jesus
Christ is the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever,” (<span
id="ix.xiv-p26.4"></span>[Heb
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008)<span id="ix.xiv-p26.4"></span>,.md)
if his power and grace had not reached to all ages from the very
creation of the world. Let us know; therefore, that to the whole human
race there has been manifested and exhibited salvation through Christ;
for not without reason is he called the son of Noah, and the son of
Adam. But as we must seek him in the word of God, the Spirit wisely
directs us, through another Evangelist, to the holy race of Abraham, to
whose hands the treasure of eternal life, along with Christ, was
committed for a time, (<span id="ix.xiv-p26.5"></span>[Ro
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001)<span id="ix.xiv-p26.5"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p27"></span>We come now to the *third* point of
difference. Matthew and Luke unquestionably do not observe the same
order; for immediately after David the one puts Solomon, and the other,
Nathan; which makes it perfectly clear that they follow different lines.
This sort of contradiction is reconciled by good and learned
interpreters in the following manner. Matthew, departing from the
natural lineage, which is followed by Luke, reckons up the legal
genealogy. I call it the *legal* genealogy, because the right to the
throne passed into the hands of Salathiel. Eusebius, in the first book
of his Ecclesiastical History, adopting the opinion of Africanus,
prefers applying the epithet *legal* to the genealogy which is traced by
Luke. But it amounts to the same thing: for he means nothing more than
this, that the kingdom, which had been established in the person of
Solomon, passed in a lawful manner to Salathiel. But it is more correct
and appropriate to say, that Matthew has exhibited the legal order:
because, by naming Solomon immediately after David, he attends, not to
the persons from whom in a regular line, according to the flesh, Christ
derived his birth, but to the manner in which he was descended from
Solomon and other kings, so as to be their lawful successor, in whose
hand God would “stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever,” (<span
id="ix.xiv-p27.1"></span>[2Sa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013)<span id="ix.xiv-p27.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p28"></span>There is probability in the opinion that,
at the death of Ahaziah, the lineal descent from Solomon was closed. As
to the command given by David — for which some persons quote the
authority of Jewish Commentators — that should the line from Solomon
fail, the royal power would pass to the descendants of Nathan, I leave
it undetermined; holding this only for certain, that the succession to
the kingdom was not confused, but regulated by fixed degrees of kindred.
Now, as the sacred history relates that, after the murder of Ahaziah,
the throne was occupied, and all the seed-royal destroyed “by his mother
Athaliah, (<span id="ix.xiv-p28.1"></span>[2Ki
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001)<span id="ix.xiv-p28.1"></span>,.md)
it is more than probable that this woman, from an eager desire of power,
had perpetrated those wicked and horrible murders that she might not be
reduced to a private rank, and see the throne transferred to another. If
there had been a son of Ahaziah still alive, the grandmother would
willingly have been allowed to reign in peace, without envy or danger,
under the mask of being his tutor. When she proceeds to such enormous
crimes as to draw upon herself infamy and hatred, it is a proof of
desperation arising from her being unable any longer to keep the royal
authority in her house.

<span id="ix.xiv-p29"></span>As to Joash being called “the son of
Ahaziah,” (<span id="ix.xiv-p29.1"></span>[2Ch
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#011)<span id="ix.xiv-p29.1"></span>,.md)
the reason is, that he was the nearest relative, and was justly
considered to be the true and direct heir of the crown. Not to mention
that Athaliah (if we shall suppose her to be his grandmother) would
gladly have availed herself of her relation to the child, will any
person of ordinary understanding think it probable, that an actual son
of the king could be so concealed by “Jehoiada the priest,” as not to
excite the grandmother to more diligent search? If all is carefully
weighed, there will be no hesitation in concluding, that the next heir
of the crown belonged to a different line. And this is the meaning of
Jehoiada’s words,

<span id="ix.xiv-p30"></span>*“*Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as
the Lord hath said of the sons of David,”  
(<span id="ix.xiv-p30.2"></span>[2Ch
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#003)<span id="ix.xiv-p30.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p31"></span>He considered it to be shameful and
intolerable, that a woman, who was a stranger by blood, should violently
seize the scepter, which God had commanded to remain in the family of
David.

<span id="ix.xiv-p32"></span>There is no absurdity in supposing, that
Luke traces the descent of Christ from Nathan: for it is possible that
the line of Solomon, so far as relates to the succession of the throne,
may have been broken off. It may be objected, that Jesus cannot be
acknowledged as the promised Messiah, if he be not a descendant of
Solomon, who was an undoubted type of *Christ* But the answer is easy.
Though he was not naturally descended from Solomon, yet he was reckoned
his son by legal succession, because he was descended from kings.

<span id="ix.xiv-p33"></span>The *fourth* point of difference is the
great diversity of the names. Many look upon this as a great difficulty:
for from David till Joseph, with the exception of Salathiel and
Zerubbabel, none of the names are alike in the two Evangelists. The
excuse commonly offered, that the diversity arose from its being very
customary among the Jews to have two names, appears to many persons not
quite satisfactory. But as we are now unacquainted with the method,
which was followed by Matthew in drawing up and arranging the genealogy,
there is no reason to wonder, if we are unable to determine how far both
of them agree or differ as to individual names. It cannot be doubted
that, after the Babylonish captivity, the same persons are mentioned
under different names. In the case of Salathiel and Zerubbabel, the same
names, I think, were purposely retained, on account of the change which
had taken place in the nation: because the royal authority was then
extinguished. Even while a feeble shadow of power remained, a striking
change was visible, which warned believers, that they ought to expect
another and more excellent kingdom than that of Solomon, which had
flourished but for a short time.

<span id="ix.xiv-p34"></span>It is also worthy of remark, that the
additional number in Luke’s catalogue to that of Matthew is nothing
strange; for the number of persons in the natural line of descent is
usually greater than in the legal line. Besides, Matthew chose to divide
the genealogy of Christ into three departments, and to make each
department to contain fourteen persons. In this way, he felt himself at
liberty to pass by some names, which Luke could not with propriety omit,
not having restricted himself by that rule.

<span id="ix.xiv-p35"></span>Thus have I discussed the genealogy of
Christ, as far as it appeared to be generally useful. If any one is
tickled  <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) by a keener curiosity, I
remember Paul’s admonition, and prefer sobriety and modesty to trifling
and useless disputes. It is a noted passage, in which he enjoins us to
avoid excessive keenness in disputing about “genealogies, as
unprofitable and vain,” (<span id="ix.xiv-p36.3"></span>Titus 3:9.)

<span id="ix.xiv-p37"></span>It now remains to inquire, lastly, why
Matthew included the whole genealogy of Christ in *three classes,* and
assigned to each class fourteen persons. Those who think that he did so,
in order to aid the memory of his readers, state a part of the reason,
but not the whole. It is true, indeed, that a catalogue, divided into
three equal numbers, is more easily remembered. But it is also evident
that this division is intended to point out a threefold condition of the
nation, from the time when Christ was promised to Abraham, to “the
fullness of the time” (<span id="ix.xiv-p37.1"></span>[Ga
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)<span id="ix.xiv-p37.1"></span>.md)
when he was “manifested in the flesh,” (<span
id="ix.xiv-p37.2"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="ix.xiv-p37.2"></span>..md)
Previous to the time of David, the tribe of Judah, though it occupied a
higher rank than the other tribes, held no power. In David the royal
authority burst upon the eyes of all with unexpected splendor, and
remained till the time of Jeconiah. After that period, there still
lingered in the tribe of Judah a portion of rank and government, which
sustained the expectations of the godly till the coming of the Messiah.

<span id="ix.xiv-p38"></span>**1.** *The book of the generation* Some
commentators give themselves unnecessary trouble, in order to excuse
Matthew for giving to his whole history this title, which applies only
to the half of a single chapter. For this <span
id="ix.xiv-p38.1"></span>ἐπιγραφή, or *title,* does not extend to the
whole book of Matthew: but the word βίβλος*, book,* is put for
*catalogue:* as if he had said, “Here follows the catalogue of the
generation of Christ.” It is with reference to the promise, that Christ
is called *the son of David, the son of Abraham:* for God had promised
to Abraham that he would give him a seed, “in whom all the families of
the earth should be blessed,” (<span id="ix.xiv-p38.2"></span>[Ge
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003)<span id="ix.xiv-p38.2"></span>..md)
David received a still clearer promise, that God would “stablish the
throne of his kingdom for ever,” (<span id="ix.xiv-p38.3"></span>[2Sa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013)<span id="ix.xiv-p38.3"></span>;.md)
that one of his posterity would be king “as long as the sun and moon

And so it became a customary way of speaking among the Jews to call
Christ *the son of David*

<span id="ix.xiv-p39"></span><span id="ix.xiv-p39.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xiv-p40"></span>**2.** *Jacob begat Judah and his brethren*
While Matthew passes by in silence Ishmael, Abraham’s first-born, and
Esau, who was Jacob’s elder brother, he properly assigns a place in the
genealogy to the Twelve Patriarchs, on all of whom God had bestowed a
similar favor of adoption. He therefore intimates, that the blessing
promised in Christ does not refer to the tribe of Judah alone, but
belongs equally to all the children of Jacob, whom God gathered into his
Church, while Ishmael and Esau were treated as strangers.  <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p42"></span><span id="ix.xiv-p42.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xiv-p43"></span>**3.** *Judah begat Pharez and Zarah by
Tamar* This was a prelude to that emptying of himself,  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) of which Paul speaks, (<span
id="ix.xiv-p44.1"></span>[Php 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.xiv-p44.1"></span>). The Son of God might have kept his descent
unspotted and pure from every reproach or mark of infamy. But he came
into the world to

<span id="ix.xiv-p45"></span>“empty himself, and take upon him the form
of a servant,”  
(<span id="ix.xiv-p45.2"></span>[Php
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="ix.xiv-p45.2"></span>.md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p46"></span>to be

<span id="ix.xiv-p47"></span>“a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and
despised of the people,”  
(<span id="ix.xiv-p47.2"></span>[Ps
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)<span id="ix.xiv-p47.2"></span>.md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p48"></span>and at length to undergo the accursed death
of the cross. He therefore did not refuse to admit a stain into his
genealogy, arising from incestuous intercourse which took place among
his ancestors. Though Tamar was not impelled by lust to seek connection
with her father-in-law, yet it was in an unlawful manner that she
attempted to revenge the injury which she had received. Judah again
intended to commit fornication, and unknowingly to himself, met with his
daughter-in-law.  <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) But the
astonishing goodness of God strove with the sin of both; so that,
nevertheless, this adulterous seed came to possess the scepter.  <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p51"></span><span id="ix.xiv-p51.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xiv-p52"></span>**6.** *Begat David the King* In this
genealogy, the designation of *King* is bestowed on David alone, because
in his person God exhibited a type of the future leader of his people,
the Messiah. The kingly office had been formerly held by Saul; but, as
he reached it through tumult and the ungodly wishes of the people, the
lawful possession of the office is supposed to have commenced with
David, more especially in reference to the covenant of God, who promised
that “his throne should be established for ever,” (<span
id="ix.xiv-p52.2"></span>[2Sa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016)<span id="ix.xiv-p52.2"></span>..md)
When the people shook off the yoke of God, and unhappily and wickedly
asked a king, saying, “Give us a king to judge us,” (<span
id="ix.xiv-p52.3"></span>[1Sa 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.xiv-p52.3"></span>,) Saul was granted for short time. But his
kingdom was shortly afterwards established by God, as a pledge of true
prosperity, in the hand of David. Let this expression, *David the King,*
be understood by us as pointing out the prosperous condition of the
people, which the Lord had appointed.

<span id="ix.xiv-p53"></span>Meanwhile, the Evangelist adds a human
disgrace, which might almost bring a stain on the glory of this divine
blessing. *David the King begat Solomon by her that had been the wife of
Uriah;* by Bathsheba, whom he wickedly tore from her husband, and for
the sake of enjoying whom, he basely surrendered an innocent man to be
murdered by the swords of the enemy, (<span
id="ix.xiv-p53.1"></span>[2Sa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#015)<span id="ix.xiv-p53.1"></span>..md)
This taint, at the commencement of the kingdom, ought to have taught the
*Jews* not to glory in the flesh. It was the design of God to show that,
in establishing this kingdom, nothing depended on human merits.

<span id="ix.xiv-p54"></span>Comparing the inspired history with the
succession described by Matthew, it is evident that he has omitted three
kings.  <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) Those who say that he did
so through forgetfulness, cannot be listened to for a moment. Nor is it
probable that they were thrown out, because they were unworthy to occupy
a place in the genealogy of Christ; for the same reason would equally
apply to many others, who are indiscriminately brought forward by
Matthew, along with pious and holy persons. A more correct account is,
that he resolved to confine the list of each class to fourteen kings,
and gave himself little concern in making the selection, because he had
an adequate succession of the genealogy to place before the eyes of his
readers, down to the close of the kingdom. As to there being only
thirteen in the list, it probably arose from the blunders and
carelessness of transcribers. Epiphanius, in his First Book against
Heresies, assigns this reason, that the name of Jeconiah had been twice
put down, and unlearned  <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) persons
ventured to strike out the repetition of it as superfluous; which, he
tells us, ought not to have been done, because Jehoiakim, the father of
king Jehoiakim, had the name Jeconiah, in common with his son, (<span
id="ix.xiv-p56.3"></span>[1Ch
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#017.md)<span id="ix.xiv-p56.3"></span>;
<span id="ix.xiv-p56.4"></span>[2Ki
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015.md)<span id="ix.xiv-p56.4"></span>;
<span id="ix.xiv-p56.5"></span>[Jer.
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#020.md), [Jer.
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004)<span id="ix.xiv-p56.5"></span>..md)
Robert Stephens quotes a Greek manuscript, in which the name of
Jehoiakim is introduced.  <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p58"></span><span id="ix.xiv-p58.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xiv-p59"></span>**12.** *After the Babylonish exile* That
is, after the Jews were carried into captivity: for the Evangelist
means, that the descendants of David, from being kings, then became
exiles and slaves. As that captivity was a sort of destruction, it came
to be wonderfully arranged by Divine providence, not only that the Jews
again united in one body, but even that some vestiges of dominion
remained in the family of David. For those who returned home submitted,
of their own accord, to the authority of Zerubbabel. In this manner, the
fragments of the royal scepter  <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md)
lasted till the coming of Christ was at hand, agreeably to the
prediction of Jacob, “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a
lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come,” (<span
id="ix.xiv-p60.2"></span>[Ge
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)<span id="ix.xiv-p60.2"></span>..md)
And even during that wretched and melancholy dispersion, the nation
never ceased to be illuminated by some rays of the grace of God. The
Greek word <span id="ix.xiv-p60.3"></span>μετοικεσία, which the old
translator renders *transmigration,* and Erasmus renders *exile,*
literally signifies *a change of habitation.* The meaning is, that the
Jews were compelled to leave their country, and to dwell as “strangers
in a land that was not theirs,” (<span id="ix.xiv-p60.4"></span>[Ge
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013)<span id="ix.xiv-p60.4"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xiv-p61"></span><span id="ix.xiv-p61.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xiv-p62"></span>**16.** *Jesus, who is called Christ* By
the surname *Christ, Anointed,* Matthew points out his office, to inform
the readers that this was not a private person, but one divinely
*anointed* to perform the office of Redeemer. What that anointing was,
and to what it referred, I shall not now illustrate at great length. As
to the word itself, it is only necessary to say that, after the royal
authority was abolished, it began to be applied exclusively to Him, from
whom they were taught to expect a full recovery of the lost salvation.
So long as any splendor of royalty continued in the family of David, the
kings were wont to be called <span id="ix.xiv-p62.1"></span>χριστοί,
*anointed.*  <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) But that the fearful
desolation which followed might not throw the minds of the godly into
despair, it pleased God to appropriate the name of *Messiah, Anointed,*
to the Redeemer alone: as is evident from Daniel, (<span
id="ix.xiv-p63.4"></span>[Dan. 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)<span id="ix.xiv-p63.4"></span>..md)
The evangelical history everywhere shows that this was an ordinary way
of speaking, at the time when the Son of God was “manifested in the
flesh,” (<span id="ix.xiv-p63.5"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="ix.xiv-p63.5"></span>..md)
