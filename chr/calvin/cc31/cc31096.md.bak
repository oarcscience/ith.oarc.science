<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p12"></span> 

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p13"></span><span id="ix.lxxxviii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p14"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p14.2"></span>[Matthew
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p14.2"></span>.** *Whosoever therefore shall confess me*
He now applies to his present subject what he formerly said in a general
manner about contempt of death: for we must struggle against the dread
of death, that it may not *keep* us back from an open confession of
faith, which God strictly demands, and which the world cannot endure.
For this purpose the disciples of Christ must be bold and courageous,
that they may be always ready for martyrdom. Now *confession* of Christ,
though it is regarded by the greater part of men as a trifling matter,
is here represented to be a main part of divine worship, and a
distinguished exercise of godliness. And justly is it so represented:
for if earthly princes, in order to enlarge and protect their glory, and
to increase their wealth, call their subjects to arms, why should not
believers maintain, at least in language, the glory of their heavenly
King?

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p15"></span>It is therefore certain that those
persons extinguish faith, (as far as lies in their powers) who inwardly
suppress it, as if the outward profession of it were unnecessary. With
good reason does Christ here call us his witnesses, by whose mouth his
name shall be celebrated in the world. In other words, he intends that
the profession of his name shall be set in opposition to false
religions: and as it is a revolting matter, he enjoins the testimony
which we must bear, that the faith of each person may not remain
concealed in the heart, but may be openly professed before men. And does
not he who refuses or is silent *deny* the Son of God, and thus banish
himself from the heavenly family?

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p16"></span>A more public confession of faith, no
doubt, is demanded from teachers than from persons in a private station.
Besides, all are not endued with an equal measure of faith, and in
proportion as any one excels in the gifts of the Spirit, he ought to go
before others by his example. But there is no believer whom the Son of
God does not require to be his witness. In what place, at what time,
with what degree of frequency, in what manner, and to what extent, we
ought to profess our faith, cannot easily be determined by a fixed rule:
but we must consider the occasion, that not one of us may fail to
discharge his duty at the proper time. We must also ask from the Lord
the spirit of wisdom and courage, that under his direction we may know
what is proper, and may boldly follow whatever we shall have ascertained
that he commands us.

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p17"></span>*Him will I also confess.* A promise
is added to inflame our zeal in this matter. But we must attend to the
points of contrast. If we draw a comparison between ourselves and the
Son of God, how base is it to refuse our testimony to him, when on his
part he offers his testimony to us by way of reward? If mortals, and men
who are of no worth, are brought into comparison with God and the angels
and all the heavenly glory, how much more valuable is that which Christ
promises than that which he requires? Although men are unbelieving and
rebellious, yet the testimony which we deliver to them is estimated by
Christ as if it had been made in the presence of God and of the angels.

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p18"></span>Thus also by way of amplification,
Mark and Luke  <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) add, *in this
adulterous and sinful generation;* the meaning of which is, that we must
not imagine our labor to be lost, because there is a want of proper
disposition in our hearers. Now if any one is not sufficiently moved by
the promise, it is followed by an awful threatening. When Christ shall
make his appearance to judge the world, he will *deny* all who have
basely *denied him before men* Let the enemies of the cross now go away,
and flatter themselves in their hypocrisy, when Christ blots their names
out of the book of life: for whom will God acknowledge as his children
at the last day, but those who are presented to him by Christ? But he
declares that he will bear witness against them, that they may not
insinuate themselves on false grounds. When it is said that Christ will
come *in the glory of the Father and of the angels,* the meaning is,
that his divine glory will then be fully manifested; and that the
*angels,* as they now surround the throne of God, will render their
services to him by honoring his majesty. The passage from the twelfth
chapter of Luke’s Gospel corresponds to the text of Matthew. What we
have inserted out of the ninth chapter, and out of Mark, appears to have
been spoken at another time: but as the doctrine is quite the same, I
have chosen to introduce them together.

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p20"></span><span id="ix.lxxxviii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p21"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p21.2"></span>[Luke
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p21.2"></span>.** *Do you suppose that I came to send
peace on the earth?* What Christ has now demanded from his disciples any
one of them would reckon it an easy matter to give, if the whole world,
with one consent, embraced the doctrine of the Gospel. But as a
considerable part of the world not only opposes but fights keenly
against it, we cannot *confess* Christ without encountering the
resistance and hatred of many. Christ therefore warns his followers to
prepare for battle, for they must necessarily fight for the testimony of
truth. And here he meets two stumbling-blocks, which otherwise would
greatly have distressed weak minds. The prophets everywhere promise that
there will be peace and tranquillity under the reign of Christ. What
then were his disciples entitled to expect but that, wherever they went,
all would instantly be at peace? Now as Christ is called *our peace,*
(<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p21.3"></span>[Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p21.3"></span>,) and as the Gospel reconciles us to God,
it follows, that he also establishes a brotherly harmony amongst us. The
kindling of wars and contentions in the world where the Gospel is
preached, does not seem to agree with the predictions of the prophets,
and still less with the office of Christ, and with the nature of the
Gospel.

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p22"></span>But that *peace* which the prophets
describe in lofty terms, is associated with faith, and has no existence
but among the sincere worshippers of God, and in the consciences of the
godly. To unbelievers it does not come, though it is offered to them;
nay, they cannot endure to be reconciled to God: and the consequence is,
that the message of peace excites in them a greater tumult than before.
As Satan, who holds a kingly power over the reprobate, is furious
against the name of Christ, as soon as the doctrine of the Gospel is
proclaimed to them, their impiety, which formerly lay asleep, acquires
fresh vigor. Thus Christ, who properly speaking, is the author of
*peace,* becomes the occasion of disturbances in consequence of the
wickedness of men.

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p23"></span>Let us hence learn how great is the
depravity of corrupt nature, which not only soils a gift so inestimable,
but changes it into a most destructive evil. Meanwhile, if tumults arise
at the commencement of the reign of Christ, let us not be alarmed at it,
as if it were strange or unusual: for he compares his Gospel to a sword,
and says that it is <span id="ix.lxxxviii-p23.1"></span>διαμερισμὸς,
*separation* Some think that this is intended to describe the punishment
which was inflicted on the despisers of the Gospel, by their rising in
hostility against each other. But the context shows, that Christ is here
exhorting his disciples to perseverance, though a good part of the world
should be at variance with them, and though their voice should be like a
war-trumpet to call innumerable enemies to arms.

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p24"></span><span id="ix.lxxxviii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p25"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p25.2"></span>[Matthew
10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#035.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p25.2"></span>** *To set a* *man at variance* Hence we
see more clearly what was stated a little before, that wars and tumults
arise, contrary to the nature of the Gospel, through the fault of wicked
men. What Malachi says about John the Baptist, \[<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p25.3"></span>[Mal.
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p25.3"></span>\] applies to all the ministers of Christ.
They are sent for this purpose *to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers.* But in
consequence of the malice of wicked men, those who were formerly
combined no sooner hear the voice of Christ than they separate into
opposite parties, and proceed so far as to break up the ties of
relationship. In a word, Christ foretells that the world will come to
such a state of confusion, that all the bonds of kindred will be treated
with indifference, and humanity will be no longer regarded. When Micah
complains \[<span id="ix.lxxxviii-p25.4"></span>[Mic
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#006.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxviii-p25.4"></span>\] that *a man’s enemies are the men of
his own house,* he deplores it as a state of extreme and ruinous
corruption. Christ declares that the same thing will happen when his
doctrine shall be published, which otherwise could not have been
believed. At the same time, he does not mean that this will uniformly
take place, as certain fretful persons foolishly imagine that it will be
impossible for them to be good disciples without forsaking parents,
children, and wives. On the contrary, every lawful bond of union is
confirmed by unity of faith: only Christ warns his followers, that when
it does happen, they must not be alarmed.
