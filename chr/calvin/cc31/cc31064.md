<span id="ix.lvi-p1"></span>MATTHEW 6:16-19

<span id="ix.lvi-p2"></span><span id="ix.lvi-p2.1"></span>[Matthew
6:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016.md)<span id="ix.lvi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lvi-p3"></span>**16**.** **Moreover, when you shall fast,
be not, like the hypocrites, dejected:  <span
id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) for they disfigure their faces, that
it may be evident to men that they fast. Verily I say to you, they have
their reward. **17**.** **But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head,
and wash thy face, **18**.** **That it may not appear to men that thou
fastest, but to thy Father, who is in secret, and thy Father, who seeth
in secret, will reward thee openly.

<span id="ix.lvi-p6"></span><span id="ix.lvi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lvi-p7"></span>He again returns to the former doctrine:
for, having begun to rebuke vain ostentation in alms and prayer, he laid
down, before proceeding farther, the rule for praying in a right manner.
The same injunction is now given to his disciples about *fasting,* which
he had formerly given about *prayers* and *alms,* not to be too
solicitous to obtain the applause of spectators, but to have God as the
witness of their actions. When he bids them *anoint their head, and wash
their face,* his language is hyperbolical:  <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) for Christ does not withdraw us from
one kind of hypocrisy, to lead us into another.  <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) He does not enjoin us to counterfeit
splendor, or exhort us to temperance in food in such a manner, as to
encourage the luxuries of ointments and of dress: but merely exhorts us
to preserve moderation, without any thing new or affected;—in short,
that the fastings, in which we engage, should make no change in our
accustomed way of living.

<span id="ix.lvi-p10"></span>*Thy Father will reward thee* When he
promises a reward from God *to fastings,* this mode of expression, as we
said a little before with respect to prayer, is not strictly accurate.
There is a wide difference, indeed, between *prayer* and *fastings*
Prayer holds the first rank among the antics of piety: but fasting is a
doubtful operation, and does not, like *alms,* belong to the class of
those actions which God requires and approves. It is pleasing to God,
only so far as it is directed to another object: and that is, to train
us to abstinence, to subdue the lust of the flesh, to excite us to
earnestness in prayer, and to testify our repentance, when we are
affected by the view of the tribunal of God. The meaning of Christ’s
words is: “God will one day show that he was pleased with those good
works, which appeared to be lost, because they were concealed from the
eyes of men.”
