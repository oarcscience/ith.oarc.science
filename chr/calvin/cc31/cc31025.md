<span id="ix.xvii-p1"></span>LUKE 2:8-14

<span id="ix.xvii-p2"></span><span id="ix.xvii-p2.1"></span>[Luke
2:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md)<span id="ix.xvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p3"></span>**8**.** **And there were shepherds in the
same country abiding in the fields,  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) and watching by night over their
flock.  <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) **9**.** **And, lo, the
angel of the Lord came upon them: and the glory  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) of the Lord shone round about them,
and they feared with a great fear. **10**.** **And the angel said to
them, Fear not: for, lo, I announce to you great joy, which shall be to
all the people: **11**.** **For this day is born to you a Savior, who is
Christ the Lord, in the city of David. **12**.** **And this shall be a
sign to you:  <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) you shall find the
babe wrapped in swaddling-bands  <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md)
laid in a manger: **13**.** **And suddenly there was present with the
angel a multitude of the heavenly host,  <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) praising God, and saying,
**14**.** **Glory in the highest  <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) to God, and on earth peace, among men
good-will.  <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md)

<span id="ix.xvii-p12"></span> 

<span id="ix.xvii-p13"></span><span id="ix.xvii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p14"></span>**8.** *And there were shepherds* It would
have been to no purpose that Christ was born in Bethlehem, if it had not
been made known to the world. But the method of doing so, which is
described by Luke, appears to the view of men very unsuitable. First,
Christ is revealed but to a few witnesses, and that too amidst the
darkness of night. Again, though God had, at his command, many honorable
and distinguished witnesses, he passed by them, and chose shepherds,
persons of humble rank, and of no account among men. Here the reason and
wisdom of the flesh must prove to be foolishness; and we must
acknowledge, that “the foolishness of God” (<span
id="ix.xvii-p14.1"></span>[1Co
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025)<span id="ix.xvii-p14.1"></span>.md)
excels all the wisdom that exists, or appears to exist, in the world.
But this too was a part of the “emptying of himself,” (<span
id="ix.xvii-p14.2"></span>[Php
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006)<span id="ix.xvii-p14.2"></span>:.md)
not that any part of Christ’s glory should be taken away by it, but that
it should lie in concealment for a time. Again, as Paul reminds us, that
the gospel is mean according to the flesh, “that our faith should stand”
in the power of the Spirit, not in the “lofty  <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) words of human wisdom,” or in any
worldly splendor,  <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) (<span
id="ix.xvii-p16.2"></span>[1 Cor. 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005)<span id="ix.xvii-p16.2"></span>;.md)
so this inestimable “treasure” has been deposited by God, from the
beginning, “in earthen vessels,” (<span id="ix.xvii-p16.3"></span>[2Co
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007)<span id="ix.xvii-p16.3"></span>,.md)
that he might more fully try the obedience of our faith. If then we
desire to come to Christ, let us not be ashamed to follow those whom the
Lord, in order to cast down the pride of the world, has taken, from
among the dung  <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) of cattle, to be
our instructors.

<span id="ix.xvii-p18"></span><span id="ix.xvii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p19"></span>**9.** *And, lo, the angel of the Lord
came upon them* He says, that *the glory of the Lord*  <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) *shone around* the shepherds, by which
they perceived him to be an angel.  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) For it would have been of little avail
to be told by an angel what is related by Luke, if God had not
testified, by some outward sign, that what they heard proceeded from
Him. The angel appeared, not in an ordinary form, or without majesty,
but surrounded with the brightness of heavenly glory, to affect
powerfully the minds of the shepherds, that they might receive the
discourse which was addressed to them, as coming from the mouth of God
himself. Hence the *fear,* of which Luke shortly afterwards speaks, by
which God usually humbles the hearts of men, (as I have formerly
explained,) and disposes them to receive his word with reverence.

<span id="ix.xvii-p22"></span><span id="ix.xvii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p23"></span>**10.** *Fear not* The design of this
exhortation is to alleviate their fear. For, though it is profitable for
the minds of men to be struck with awe, that they may learn to “give
unto the Lord the glory due unto his name,” (<span
id="ix.xvii-p23.1"></span>[Ps
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002)<span id="ix.xvii-p23.1"></span>;.md)
yet they have need, at the same time, of consolation, that they may not
be altogether overwhelmed. For the majesty of God could not but swallow
up the whole world, if there were not some mildness to mitigate the
terror which it brings. And so the reprobate fall down lifeless at the
sight of God, because he appears to them in no other character than that
of a judge. But to revive the minds of the shepherds, the angel declares
that he was sent to them for a different purpose, to *announce to them*
the mercy of God. When men hear this single word, that God is reconciled
to them, it not only raises up those who are fallen down, but restores
those who were ruined, and recalls them from death to life.

<span id="ix.xvii-p24"></span>The angel opens his discourse by saying,
that he *announces great joy;* and next assigns the ground or matter of
joy, that *a Savior is born* These words show us, first, that, until men
have peace with God, and are reconciled to him through the grace of
Christ, all the joy that they experience is deceitful, and of short
duration.  <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) Ungodly men
frequently indulge in frantic and intoxicating mirth; but if there be
none to make peace between them and God, the hidden stings of conscience
must produce fearful torment. Besides, to whatever extent they may
flatter themselves in luxurious indulgence, their own lusts are so many
tormentors. The commencement of solid joy is, to perceive the fatherly
love of God toward us, which alone gives tranquillity to our minds. And
this “joy,” in which, Paul tells us, “the kingdom of God” consists, is
“in the Holy Spirit,” (<span id="ix.xvii-p25.2"></span>[Ro
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md)<span
id="ix.xvii-p25.2"></span>.) By calling it *great joy,* he shows us, not
only that we ought, above all things, to rejoice in the salvation
brought us by Christ, but that this blessing is so great and boundless,
as fully to compensate for all the pains, distresses, and anxieties of
the present life. Let us learn to be so delighted with Christ alone,
that the perception of his grace may overcome, and at length remove from
us, all the distresses of the flesh.  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)

<span id="ix.xvii-p27"></span>*Which shall be to all the people* Though
the angel addresses the shepherds alone, yet he plainly states, that the
message of salvation which he brings is of wider extent, so that not
only they, in their private capacity, may hear it, but that others may
also hear. Now let it be understood, that this joy was common to all
people, because, it was indiscriminately offered to all. For God had
promised Christ, not to one person or to another, but to the whole seed
of Abraham. If the Jews were deprived, for the most part, of the joy
that was offered to them, it arose from their unbelief; just as, at the
present day, God invites all indiscriminately to salvation through the
Gospel, but the ingratitude of the world is the reason why this grace,
which is equally offered to all, is enjoyed by few. Although this joy is
confined to a few persons, yet, with respect to God, it is said to be
common. When the angel says that this *joy shall be to all the people,*
he speaks of the chosen people only; but now that, the middle wall of
partition” (<span id="ix.xvii-p27.1"></span>[Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)<span id="ix.xvii-p27.1"></span>.md)
has been thrown down, the same message has reference to the whole human
race.  <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) For Christ proclaims
peace, not only, to them that are nigh, “but to them that are, far off,”
(<span id="ix.xvii-p28.2"></span>[Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)<span id="ix.xvii-p28.2"></span>,.md)
to “strangers” (<span id="ix.xvii-p28.3"></span>[Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012)<span id="ix.xvii-p28.3"></span>.md)
equally with citizens. But as the peculiar covenant with the Jews lasted
till the resurrection of Christ, so the angel separates them from the
rest of the nations.

<span id="ix.xvii-p29"></span><span id="ix.xvii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p30"></span>**11.** *This day is born to you* Here, as
we lately hinted, the angel expresses the cause of the joy. *This day is
born* the Redeemer long ago promised, who was to restore the Church of
God to its proper condition. The angel does not speak of it as a thing
altogether unknown. He opens his embassy by referring to the Law and the
Prophets; for had he been addressing heathens or irreligious persons, it
would have been of no use to employ this mode of speaking: *this day is
born to you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord* For the same reason, he
mentions that he was born *in the city of David,* which could serve no
purpose, but to recall the remembrance of those promises which were
universally known among the Jews. Lastly, the angel adapted his
discourse to hearers who were not altogether unacquainted with the
promised redemption. With the doctrine of the Law and the Prophets he
joined the Gospel, as emanating from the same source. Now, since the
Greek word Greek, as Cicero assures us, has a more extensive meaning
than the Latin word *Servator,* and as there is no Latin noun that
corresponds to it, I thought it better to employ a barbarous term, than
to take anything away from the power of Christ. And I have no doubt,
that the author of the Vulgate, and the ancient doctors of the Church,
had the same intention.  <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) Christ
is called Savior,  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) because he
bestows a complete salvation. The pronoun *to you*  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) is very emphatic; for it would have
given no great delight to hear that the Author of salvation was *born,*
unless each person believed that for himself he was born. In the same
manner Isaiah says, “Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given,”
(<span id="ix.xvii-p33.2"></span>[Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)<span id="ix.xvii-p33.2"></span>;.md)
and Zechariah, “Behold, thy King cometh unto thee lowly,” (<span
id="ix.xvii-p33.3"></span>[Zec
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)<span id="ix.xvii-p33.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xvii-p34"></span><span id="ix.xvii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p35"></span>**12.** *And this shall be a sign to you*
 <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) The angel meets the prejudice
which might naturally hinder the faith of the shepherds; for what a
mockery is it, that he, whom God has sent to be the King, and the only
Savior, is seen lying in a manger! That the mean and despicable
condition in which Christ was might not deter the shepherds from
believing in Christ, the angel tells them beforehand what they would
see. This method of proceeding, which might appear, to the view of men,
absurd and almost ridiculous, the Lord pursues toward us every day.
Sending down to us from heaven the word of the Gospel, he enjoins us to
embrace Christ crucified, and holds out to us *signs* in earthly and
fading elements, which raise us to the glory of a blessed immortality.
Having promised to us spiritual righteousness, he places before our eyes
a little water: by a small portion of bread and wine, he seals,  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) the eternal life of the soul.  <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) But if the stable gave no offense
whatever to the shepherds, so as to prevent them from going to Christ to
obtain salvation, or from yielding to his authority, while he was yet a
child; no sign, however mean in itself, ought to hide his glory from our
view, or prevent us from offering to him lowly adoration, now that he
has ascended to heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father.

<span id="ix.xvii-p39"></span><span id="ix.xvii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p40"></span>**13.** *And suddenly there was present
with the angel a multitude* An exhibition of divine splendor had been
already made in the person of a single angel. But God determined to
adorn his own Son in a still more illustrious manner, This was done to
confirm our faith as truly as that of the shepherds. Among men, the
testimony of “*two or three witnesses*” (<span
id="ix.xvii-p40.1"></span>[Mt
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016)<span id="ix.xvii-p40.1"></span>.md)
is sufficient to remove all doubt. But here is a heavenly host, with one
consent and one voice bearing testimony to the Son of God. What then
would be our obstinacy, if we refused to join with the choir of angels,
in singing the praises of our salvation, which is in Christ? Hence we
infer, how abominable in the sight of God must unbelief be, which
disturbs this delightful harmony between heaven and earth. Again, we are
convicted of more than brutal stupidity, if our faith and our zeal to
praise God are not inflamed by the song which the angels, with the view
of supplying us with the matter of our praise, sang in full harmony.
Still farther, by this example of heavenly melody, the Lord intended to
recommend to us the unity of faith, and to exhort us to join with one
consent in singing his praises on earth.

<span id="ix.xvii-p41"></span><span id="ix.xvii-p41.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvii-p42"></span>**14.** *Glory to God in the highest* The
angels begin with thanksgiving, or with the praises of God; for
Scripture, too, everywhere reminds us, that we were redeemed from death
for this purpose, that we might testify with the tongue, as well as by
the actions of the life, our gratitude to God. Let us remember, then,
the final cause, why God reconciled us to himself through his Only
Begotten Son. It was that he might glorify his name, by revealing the
riches of his grace, and of his boundless mercy. And even now to
whatever extent any one is excited by his knowledge of grace to
celebrate the glory of God, such is the extent of proficiency in the
faith of Christ. Whenever our salvation is mentioned, we should
understand that a signal has been given,  <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) to excite us to thanksgiving and to
the praises of God.

<span id="ix.xvii-p44"></span>*On earth peace* The most general reading
is, that the words, *among men good-will,* should stand as a third
clause. So far as relates to the leading idea of the passage, it is of
little moment which way you read it; but the other appears to be
preferable. The two clauses, *Glory to God in the highest,* and *peace
on earth,* do unquestionably agree with each other; but if you do not
place *men* and *God* in marked opposition, the contrast will not fully
appear.  <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) Perhaps commentators
have mistaken the meaning of the preposition <span
id="ix.xvii-p45.2"></span>ἐν, for it was an obscure meaning of the words
to say, that there is *peace in men;* but as that word is redundant in
many passages of Scripture, it need not detain us here. However, if any
one prefer to throw it to the last clause, the meaning will be the same,
as I shall presently show.

<span id="ix.xvii-p46"></span>We must now see what the angels mean by
the word *peace.* They certainly do not speak of an outward peace
cultivated by men with each other; but they say, that the earth is at
peace, when men have been reconciled to God, and enjoy an inward
tranquillity in their own minds.  <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) We know that we are born “children of
wrath,” (<span id="ix.xvii-p47.2"></span>[Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003)<span id="ix.xvii-p47.2"></span>,.md)
and are by nature enemies to God; and must be distressed by fearful
apprehensions, so long as we feel that God is angry with us. A short and
clear definition of *peace* may be obtained from two opposite things, —
the wrath of God and the dread of death. It has thus a twofold
reference; one to God, and another to men. We obtain peace with God,
when he begins to be gracious to us, by taking away our guilt, and “not
imputing to us our trespasses,” (<span id="ix.xvii-p47.3"></span>[2Co
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)<span id="ix.xvii-p47.3"></span>;.md)
and when we, relying on his fatherly love, address him with full
confidence, and boldly praise him for the salvation which he has
promised to us. Now though, in another passage, the life of man on earth
is declared to be a continual warfare,  <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) (<span id="ix.xvii-p48.2"></span>[Job
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001)<span id="ix.xvii-p48.2"></span>,.md)
and the state of the fact shows that nothing is more full of trouble
than our condition, so long as we remain in the world, yet the angels
expressly say that there is *peace on earth* This is intended to inform
us that, so long as we trust to the grace of Christ, no troubles that
can arise will prevent us from enjoying composure and serenity of mind.
Let us then remember, that faith is seated amidst the storms of
temptations, amidst various dangers, amidst violent attacks, amidst
contests and fears, that our faith may not fail or be shaken by any kind
of opposition.

<span id="ix.xvii-p49"></span>*Among men good-will*  <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) The Vulgate has *good-will* in the
genitive case: *to men of good-will.*  <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) How that reading crept in, I know not:
but it ought certainly to be rejected, both because it is not genuine,
 <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) and because it entirely
corruptsthe meaning. Others read *good-will* in the nominative case, and
still mistake its meaning. They refer *good-will* to men, as if it were
an exhortation to embrace the grace of God. I acknowledge that the peace
which the Lord offers to us takes effect only when we receive it. But as
<span id="ix.xvii-p52.3"></span>εὐδοκία is constantly used in Scripture
in the sense of the Hebrew word <span id="ix.xvii-p52.4"></span>רצון,
the old translator rendered it <span
id="ix.xvii-p52.5"></span>*beneplacitum,* or, *good-will.* This passage
is not correctly understood as referring to the acceptance of grace. The
angels rather speak of it as the source of peace, and thus inform us
that peace is a free gift, and flows from the pure mercy of God. If it
is thought better to read *good-will to men,* or *towards men,*  <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) it will not be inadmissible, so far as
regards the meaning: for in this way it will show the cause of *peace*
to be, that God has been pleased to bestow his undeserved favor on men,
with whom he formerly was at deadly variance. If you read, *the peace of
good-will* as meaning voluntary peace, neither will I object to that
interpretation. But the simpler way is to look upon <span
id="ix.xvii-p53.3"></span>εὐφοκία as added, in order to inform us of the
source from which our peace is derived.  <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md)

<span id="ix.xvii-p28"></span> “<span id="ix.xvii-p28.1"></span>Au
reste, il est bien vray que l'ange parle seulement du peuple esleu,
assavoir des Juifs; mais pourceque maintenant la paroy qui faisoit
separation est rompue, la mesme ambassade s'addresse aujourdhui a tout
le genre humain.” — “Besides, it is very true that the angel speaks only
of the elect people, namely, the Jews; but because now the wall of
partition which made a separation is broken down, the same message is
addressed, at the present day, to all the human race.”

<span id="ix.xvii-p31"></span> He refers to his use of the Latin word
<span id="ix.xvii-p31.1"></span>*Salvator,* for which there is no
classical authority. The apology may be deemed unnecessary; but Calvin
was entitled to be more sensitive on this point than many modern
scholars. The purity of his style discovers so perfect an acquaintance
with the writers of the Augustan age, that it must have given him
uneasiness to depart from their authorized terms. He pleads high
authority for the liberty he had taken. Cicero, whose command of the
resources of his native tongue will not be questioned, acknowledges that
there is no Latin word which conveys the full import of the Greek word
σωτ́ηρ, and in this, as well as many other instances, calls in the aid of
a richer and more expressive language than his own. — *Ed.*

<span id="ix.xvii-p33"></span> “<span id="ix.xvii-p33.1"></span>Au
reste, ce n'est pas sans cause que ce mot *Vous* est adjouste: et il est
bien a poiser. Car il ne serviroit gueres de savoir que le Sauveur est
nay, sinon qu'un chacun appliquast cela a sa personne, s'asseurant que
c'est pour lui qu'est nay le Fils de Dieu.” — “Besides, it is not
without reason that this word *You* is added; and it is well to weigh
it. For it would hardly be of service to know that the Savior is born,
unless each applied that to his own person, being persuaded that it is
for him that the Savior is born.”

<span id="ix.xvii-p37"></span> “<span id="ix.xvii-p37.1"></span>Eternam
animi vitam obsignat.”—Our rendering is close. But what is *sealed?* Is
it meant, that the mere act of partaking the Lord's Supper places beyond
a doubt the salvation of the worshipper, or even gives to it any
additional certainty? In some loose sense of this sort, the phrase is
often enough used even by Protestant divines. It is satisfactory to have
Calvin's own authority for the meaning of this passage. “<span
id="ix.xvii-p37.2"></span>*Il seelle la promesse.”* — *“*He seals the
promise.” The meaning is, that God ratifies his word. By condescending
to employ outward symbols, together with his holy word, for expressing
the blessings of salvation he holds out to his people an additional
testimony, and in this manner grants a strong confirmation to their
faith. — *Ed.*

spirituelle, il nous met devant les yeux un peu d'eau: par un petit
morceau de pain et une goutte de vin, il seelle la promesse qu'il a
faite de la vie eternelle de nos ames.” — “As, having promised to us
spiritual righteousness, he places before our eyes a little water: by a
small morsel of bread and a drop of wine, he seals the promise which he
has made of the eternal life of our souls.”
