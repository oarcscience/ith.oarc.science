<span id="ix.x-p1"></span>LUKE 1:51-55

<span id="ix.x-p2"></span><span id="ix.x-p2.1"></span>[Luke
1:51-55](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#051.md)<span id="ix.x-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p3"></span>**51**.** **He hath done might  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) with his arm: he hath scattered the proud
in the thought of their heart. **52**.** **He hath cast down the nobles
from their thrones, and hath exalted mean persons. **53**.** **He hath
filled the hungry with good things, and hath sent the rich away empty.
**54**.** **He hath lifed up his servant Israel, so as to be mindful of
his mercy, **55**.** **As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to
his seed for ever.

<span id="ix.x-p5"></span> 

<span id="ix.x-p6"></span><span id="ix.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p7"></span>**51.** *He hath done might* This means, “he
hath wrought powerfully.” The *arm* of God is contrasted with every
other aid: as in Isaiah, “I looked, and there was none to help,” (<span
id="ix.x-p7.1"></span>[Isa 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.x-p7.1"></span>;) *“therefore,”* says he elsewhere,

<span id="ix.x-p8"></span>“his arm brought salvation unto him;  
and his righteousness, it sustained him,” (<span
id="ix.x-p8.2"></span>[Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md)<span
id="ix.x-p8.2"></span>.)

<span id="ix.x-p9"></span>Mary therefore means: God rested satisfied
with his own power, employed no companions in the work, called none to
afford him aid. What immediately follows about *the proud* may be
supposed to be added for one of two reasons: either because *the proud*
gain nothing by endeavoring, like the giants of old, to oppose God; or,
because God does not display the power of his arm for salvation, except
in the case of the *humble,* while *the proud,* who arrogate much to
themselves, are *thrown down* To this relates the exhortation of Peter,

<span id="ix.x-p10"></span>“Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of
God,”  
(<span id="ix.x-p10.2"></span>[1Pe
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006)<span id="ix.x-p10.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.x-p11"></span>*He hath scattered*  <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) *the proud in the thought of their heart*
 <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) This expression is worthy of
notice: for as their pride and ambition are outrageous, as their
covetousness is insatiable, they pile up their deliberations to form an
immense heap, and, to say all in a single word, they build the tower of
Babel, (<span id="ix.x-p13.2"></span>[Ge
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009)<span id="ix.x-p13.2"></span>..md)
Not satisfied with having made one or another foolish attempt beyond
their strength, or with their former schemes of mad presumption, they
still add to their amount. When God has for a time looked down from
heaven, in silent mockery, on their splendid preparations, he
unexpectedly scatters the whole mass: just as when a building is
overturned, and its parts, which had formerly been bound together by a
strong and firm union, are widely scattered in every direction.

<span id="ix.x-p14"></span><span id="ix.x-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p15"></span>**52.** *He hath cast down the nobles* This
translation has been adopted, for the sake of avoiding ambiguity: for
though the Greek word <span id="ix.x-p15.1"></span>δυνάσται is derived
from <span id="ix.x-p15.2"></span>δύναμις*, power,* it denotes governors
and eminent rulers.  <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) Many persons
think that <span id="ix.x-p16.3"></span>δυνάστας is a participle. They
are said by Mary to be *cast down from their thrones,* that obscure and
unknown persons may be elevated in their room; and so she ascribes to
the providence and judgments of God what ungodly men can the game of
Fortune.  <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) Let us understand, that
she does not ascribe to God a despotic power,—as if men were tossed and
thrown up and down like balls by a tyrannical authority,—but a just
government, founded on the best reasons, though they frequently escape
our notice. God does not delight in changes, or elevate in mockery to a
lofty station, those whom he has determined immediately to throw down.
 <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) It is rather the depravity of men
that overturns the state of things, because nobody acknowledges that the
disposal of every one is placed in His will and power.

<span id="ix.x-p19"></span>Those who occupy a higher station than others
are not only chargeable with disdainfully and cruelly insulting their
neighbors, but act in a daring manner towards Him to whom they owe their
elevation. To instruct us by facts, that whatever is lofty and elevated
in the world is subject to God, and that the whole world is governed by
his dominion, some are exalted to high honor, while others either come
down in a gradual manner, or else fall headlong from their thrones. Such
is the cause and object of the changes which is assigned by David, “He
poureth contempt upon princes,” (<span id="ix.x-p19.1"></span>[Ps
107:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#039)<span id="ix.x-p19.1"></span>;.md)
and by Daniel,

<span id="ix.x-p20"></span>“He changeth the times and the seasons:  
he removeth kings, and setteth up kings,” (<span
id="ix.x-p20.2"></span>[Da 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021.md)<span
id="ix.x-p20.2"></span>.)

<span id="ix.x-p21"></span>We see, indeed, how the princes of the world
grow extravagantly insolent, indulge in luxury, swell with pride, and
are intoxicated with the sweets of prosperity. If the Lord cannot
tolerate such ingratitude, we need not be surprised.

<span id="ix.x-p22"></span>The usual consequence is, that those whom God
has raised to a high estate do not occupy it long. Again, the dazzling
luster of kings and princes so overpowers the multitude, that there are
few who consider that there is a God above. But if princes brought a
scepter with them from the womb, and if the stability of their thrones
were perpetual, all acknowledgment of God and of his providence would
immediately disappear. When the Lord raises mean persons to exalted
rank, he triumphs over the pride of the world, and at the same time
encourages simplicity and modesty in his own people.

<span id="ix.x-p23"></span>Thus, when Mary says, that it is God who
*casteth down nobles from their thrones, and exalteth mean persons,* she
teaches us, that the world does not move and revolve by a blind impulse
of Fortune, but that all the revolutions observed in it are brought
about by the Providence of God, and that those judgments, which appear
to us to disturb and overthrow the entire framework of soclety, are
regulated by God with unerring justice. This is confirmed by the
following verse, *He hath filled the hungry with good things, and hath
sent the rich away empty:* for hence we infer that it is not in
themselves, but for a good reason, that God takes pleasure in these
changes. It is because the great, and rich, and powerful, lifted up by
their abundance, ascribe all the praise to themselves, and leave nothing
to God. We ought therefore to be scrupulously on our guard against being
carried away by prosperity, and against a vain satisfaction of the
flesh, lest God suddenly deprive us of what we enjoy. To such godly
persons as feel poverty and almost famine, and lift up their cry to God,
no small consolation is afforded by this doctrine, that he *filleth the
hungry with good things*

<span id="ix.x-p24"></span><span id="ix.x-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p25"></span>**54.** *He hath lifted up his servant
Israel* In this last clause the general statements are applied by Mary
to the present occasion. The meaning is, God has now granted the
salvation which he had formerly promised to the holy fathers. And first,
the verb <span id="ix.x-p25.1"></span>ἀντιλαμζάνεσθαι*, to lift up,*
contains an elegant metaphor:  <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) for
the state of the nation was so fallen, that its entire restoration could
not be expected on ordinary principles. And then God is said to have
*lifted up Israel,* because he stretched out his hand, and lifted him up
when lying prostrate. Religion had been polluted in innumerable ways.
The public instruction retained almost nothing pure. The government of
the Church was in the greatest confusion, and breathed nothing but
shocking barbarity. The order of civil society no longer subsisted. The
great body of the people were torn like wild beasts by the Romans and
Herod. So much the more glorious was the restoration, which a state of
affairs so desperate did not allow them to expect. <span
id="ix.x-p26.1"></span>Παιδὸς may here be taken either for *child* or
for *servant:* but the latter signification is more appropriate.
*Israel* is called, in this as in many other places, the *servant* of
God, because he had been received into the family of God.

<span id="ix.x-p27"></span>*So as to be mindful* Mary assigns the reason
why the nation, when verging to ruin, was received by God; or rather,
why God lifted it up when already fallen. It was to give an illustration
of his *mercy* in its preservation. She expressly mentions that God had
*remembered* his mercy, which he might appear in some sort to have
forgotten, when he permitted his people to be so fearfully distressed
and afflicted. It is customary to ascribe affections to God, as men
conclude from the event itself, that he is offended with them, or that
he is reconciled. Now, as the human mind forms no conception of the
divine mercy, except so far as it is presented and declared in his own
word, Mary directs her own attention and that of others to the promises,
 <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) and shows that, in the
accomplishment of them, God has been true and faithful. In this sense,
Scripture makes frequent mention of God’s mercy and truth, (<span
id="ix.x-p28.2"></span>[Mic 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020.md)<span
id="ix.x-p28.2"></span>;) because we shall never be convinced of his
fatherly kindness toward us, unless his word, by which he hath bound
himself to us, be present to our recollection, and unless it occupy, as
it were, an interterm is here, as at <span id="ix.x-p28.3"></span>[Ac
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035.md)<span id="ix.x-p28.3"></span>,
and often in the classical writers, used metaphorically in the sense of
to protect, support.” — *Bloomfield.* mediate position between us, to
link the goodness of God with our own individual salvation. By these
words *Mary* shows, that the covenant which God had made with the
fathers was of free grace; for she traces the salvation promised in it
to the fountain of unmixed *mercy* Hence too we infer, that she was well
acquainted with the doctrine of Scripture. The expectation of the
Messiah was at that time, indeed, very general, but few had their faith
established on so pure a knowledge of Scripture.

<span id="ix.x-p29"></span><span id="ix.x-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p30"></span>**55.** *To Abraham and to his seed* If you
read these words in close connection with the close of the former verse,
there appears to be an improper change of the case. Instead of <span
id="ix.x-p30.1"></span>τῶ ᾿Αβραὰμ καὶ τῶ σπέρματι, it ought to have been
(<span id="ix.x-p30.2"></span>πρὸς)<span id="ix.x-p30.3"></span>τὸν
᾿Αβραὰμ καὶ τὸ σπέρμα,*, as he spake* TO *our fathers,* TO *Abraham and*
TO *his seed*  <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) But, in my opinion,
there is no such close connection. Mary does not merely explain who the
Fathers were to whom God spake, but extends the power and result of the
promises to all his posterity, provided they are the true seed of
Abraham. Hence it follows, that the matter now in hand is, the solemn
covenant which had been made, in a peculiar manner, with Abraham and his
descendants. For other promises, which had been given to Adam, and Noah,
and others, referred indiscriminately to all nations. As many of the
children of Abraham, according to the flesh, have been cut off by their
unbelief, and have been thrown out as degenerate from the family of
Abraham, so we, who were strangers, are admitted to it by faith, and
regarded as the true seed of Abraham. Let us therefore hold that, in
consequence of God having formerly *spoken to the fathers,* the grace
offered to them belongs equally to their posterity; and also, that the
adoption has been extended to all nations, so that those, who were not
by nature children of Abraham, may be his spiritual *seed*
