to Jordan to John, that he might be baptized by him. **14**.** **But
John forbade  <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) him, saying, I

**15**.** **And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it now: for thus it
becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers him.
**16**.** **And Jesus, having been baptized, went up immediately from
the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.

Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan.

 <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) as a dove, upon him, and a

<span id="ix.xxx-p13"></span>**<span id="ix.xxx-p13.2"></span>[Matthew
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013.md)<span id="ix.xxx-p13.2"></span>.**
*That he might be baptized by him.* For what purpose did the Son of God
wish to be baptized? This may be learned, in some measure, from his
answer. We have already assigned a special reason. He received the same
baptism with us, in order to assure believers, that they are ingrafted
into his body, and that they are “buried with him in baptism,” that they
may rise to “newness of life,” (<span id="ix.xxx-p13.3"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="ix.xxx-p13.3"></span>..md)
But the end, which he here proposes, is more *extensive: for thus it
became him to fulfill all righteousness,* (<span
id="ix.xxx-p13.4"></span>[Mt 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md)<span
id="ix.xxx-p13.4"></span>.) The word *righteousness* frequently
signifies, in Scripture, the observation of the law: and in that sense
we may explain this passage to mean that, since Christ had voluntarily
subjected himself to the law, it was necessary that he should keep it in
every part. But I prefer a more simple interpretation. “Say nothing for
the present,” said our Lord, “about my rank:  <span
id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) for the question before us is not,
which of us deserves to be placed above the other.  <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) Let us rather consider what our
calling demands, and what has been enjoined on us by God the Father.”
The general reason why Christ received baptism was, that he might render
full obedience to the Father; and the special reason was, that he might
consecrate baptism in his own body, that we might have it in common with
him.

<span id="ix.xxx-p16"></span><span id="ix.xxx-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxx-p17"></span>**14.** *I have need to be baptized by
thee.* It is certain, that John acknowledged Christ to be not only a
distinguished prophet, as many foolishly dream, but the Son of God, as
he really was: for otherwise he would have dishonored God by lowering
his holy calling to a mortal man. How he came to know this, the reader
will learn by consulting John’s Gospel, (<span
id="ix.xxx-p17.1"></span>[John 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md),
[33](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033)<span id="ix.xxx-p17.1"></span>.md)
There was, no doubt, plausibility in this ground of refusal, that Christ
had no need of his baptism: but John was mistaken in not considering,
that it was for the sake of others that baptism was asked.  <span
id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) And so Christ bids him consider, what
was suitable to the character of a *servant*, (<span
id="ix.xxx-p18.2"></span>[Php 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.xxx-p18.2"></span>,) which he had undertaken; for a voluntary
subjection takes nothing from his glory. Though the good man  <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) remained ignorant, for a time, of some
part of his public duty, this particular error did not prevent him from
discharging, in a proper and lawful manner, his office of Baptist. This
example shows, that we do not act rashly, in undertaking the commission
which the Lord has given us, according to the light we enjoy, though we
do not immediately comprehend all that belongs to our calling, or that
depends upon it. We must also observe his modesty, in giving up his
opinion, and immediately obeying Christ.

<span id="ix.xxx-p20"></span><span id="ix.xxx-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxx-p21"></span>**16.** *And, lo, the heavens were opened
to him.* *The opening of the heavens* sometimes means a manifestation of
heavenly glory; but here it means also a *cleft, or opening,* of the
visible heaven, so that John could see something beyond the planets and
stars. The words of Mark can have no other meaning, *he saw the heavens
cleft asunder*  <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) An exact inquiry
into the way in which this opening was made, would be of no importance,
nor is it necessary. It is sufficient for us to believe, that it was a
symbol of the Divine presence. As the Evangelists say that John saw the
Holy Spirit, it is probable that the *opening of the heavens* was
chiefly on his account. Yet I do not hesitate to admit that Christ also,
so far as he was man, received from it additional certainty as to his
heavenly calling. This appears to be the tendency of the words of Luke:
*while Jesus was praying, the heaven was opened*, (<span
id="ix.xxx-p22.2"></span>[Lu 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md)<span
id="ix.xxx-p22.2"></span>:) for, though his prayers were always directed
towards the benefit of others, yet as man, when he commenced a warfare
of so arduous a description, he needed to be armed with a remarkable
power of the Spirit.

<span id="ix.xxx-p23"></span>But here two questions arise. The *first*
is, why did the Spirit, who had *formerly* dwelt in Christ, descend upon
*him at that time?* This question is answered by a passage of the
prophet Isaiah, which will be handled in another place.

<span id="ix.xxx-p24"></span>“The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me;
because the Lord God hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the
meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted,” (<span
id="ix.xxx-p24.1"></span>[Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001)<span id="ix.xxx-p24.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xxx-p25"></span>Though the grace of the Spirit was bestowed
on Christ in a remarkable and extraordinary manner, (<span
id="ix.xxx-p25.1"></span>[Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)<span id="ix.xxx-p25.1"></span>,.md)
yet he remained at home as a private person, till he should be called to
public life by the Father. Now that the full time is come, for preparing
to discharge the office of Redeemer, he is clothed with a new power of
the Spirit, and that not so much for his own sake, as for the sake of
others. It was done on purpose, that believers might learn to receive,
and to contemplate with reverence, his divine power, and that the
weakness of the flesh might not make him despised.

<span id="ix.xxx-p26"></span><span id="ix.xxx-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxx-p27"></span>This was also the reason why he delayed his
baptism till *the thirtieth year of his age,* (<span
id="ix.xxx-p27.2"></span>[Lu 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023.md)<span
id="ix.xxx-p27.2"></span>.) Baptism was an appendage to the Gospel: and
therefore it began at the same time with the preaching of the Gospel.
When Christ was preparing to preach the Gospel, he was introduced by
Baptism into his office; and at the same time was endued with the Holy
Spirit. When John beholds the Holy Spirit descending upon Christ, it is
to remind him, that nothing carnal or earthly must be expected in
Christ, but that he comes as a godlike man,  <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) descended from heaven, in whom the
power of the Holy Spirit reigns. We know, indeed, that he is *God
manifested in the flesh,* (<span id="ix.xxx-p28.2"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="ix.xxx-p28.2"></span>:.md)
but even in his character as a servant, and in his human nature, there
is a heavenly power to be considered.

<span id="ix.xxx-p29"></span>The *second* question is, why did the Holy
Spirit appear in the shape of a *dove,* rather than in that of *fire*?
The answer depends on the analogy, or resemblance between the figure and
the thing represented. We know what the prophet Isaiah ascribes to
Christ.

<span id="ix.xxx-p30"></span>“He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause
his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break,
and the smoking flax shall he not quench,” (<span
id="ix.xxx-p30.1"></span>[Isa. 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003)<span id="ix.xxx-p30.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xxx-p31"></span>On account of this mildness of Christ, by
which he kindly and gently called, and every day invites, sinners to the
hope of salvation, *the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the appearance
of a dove* And in this symbol has been held out to us an eminent token
of the sweetest consolation, that we may not fear to approach to Christ,
who meets us, not in the formidable power of the Spirit, but clothed
with gentle and lovely grace.

<span id="ix.xxx-p32"></span>*He saw the Spirit of God* That is, John
*saw:* for it immediately follows, that *the Spirit descended on Christ*
There now arises a *third* question, how could John see the Holy Spirit?
I reply: As the Spirit of God is everywhere present, and fills heaven
and earth, he is not said, in a literal sense, to *descend,* and the
same observation may be made as to his *appearance.* Though he is in
himself invisible, yet he is spoken of as *beheld,* when he exhibits any
visible sign of his presence. John did not see the essence of the
Spirit, which cannot be discerned by the senses of men;  <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) nor did he see his power, which is not
beheld by human senses, but only by the understanding of faith: but he
saw *the appearance of a dove,* under which God showed the presence of
his Spirit. It is a figure of speech,  <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) by which the sign is put for the thing
signified, the name of a spiritual object being applied to the visible
sign.

<span id="ix.xxx-p35"></span>While it is foolish and improper to press,
as some do, the literal meaning, so as to include both the sign and the
thing signified, we must observe, that the connection subsisting between
the sign and the thing signified is denoted by these modes of
expression. In this sense, the bread of the Lord’s Supper is called *the
body of Christ,* (<span id="ix.xxx-p35.1"></span>[1Co
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016)<span id="ix.xxx-p35.1"></span>:.md)
not because it is so, but because it assures us, that the body of Christ
is truly given to us for food. Meanwhile, let us bear in mind what I
have just mentioned, that we must not imagine a descent of the thing
signified, so as to seek it in the sign, as if it had a bodily place
there, but ought to be abundantly satisfied with the assurance, that God
grants, by his secret power, all that he holds out to us by figures.

<span id="ix.xxx-p36"></span>Another question more curious than useful
has been put. Was this *dove* a solid body, or the appearance of one?
Though the words of Luke seem to intimate that it was not the substance
of a body, but only *a bodily appearance;* yet, lest I should afford to
any man an occasion of wrangling, I leave the matter unsettled.

<span id="ix.xxx-p37"></span><span id="ix.xxx-p37.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxx-p38"></span>**17.** And, *lo, a voice from heaven* From
that *opening of the heavens,* which has been already mentioned, a loud
voice was heard, that its majesty might be more impressive. The public
appearance of Christ, to undertake the office of Mediator, was
accompanied by this announcement,  <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) in which he was offered to us by the
Father, that we may rely on this pledge of our adoption, and boldly call
God himself our Father. The designation of *Son* belongs truly and
naturally to Christ alone: but yet he was declared to be the Son of God
in our flesh, that the favor of Him, whom he alone has a right to call
*Father,* may be also obtained for us. And thus when God presents Christ
to us as Mediator, accompanied by the title of *Son,* he declares that
he is the *Father of us all,* (<span id="ix.xxx-p39.2"></span>[Eph
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006)<span id="ix.xxx-p39.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xxx-p40"></span>Such, too, is the import of the epithet
*beloved:* for in ourselves we are hateful to God, and his fatherly love
must flow to us by Christ. The best expounder of this passage is the
Apostle Paul, when he says

<span id="ix.xxx-p41"></span>“who hath predestinated us into adoption by
Jesus Christ in himself, according to the good pleasure of his will; to
the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath accepted us in
the Beloved,”  
(<span id="ix.xxx-p41.2"></span>[Eph.
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006)<span id="ix.xxx-p41.2"></span>.md)

<span id="ix.xxx-p42"></span>that is, in his beloved Son. It is still
more fully expressed by these words, in *whom I am well pleased* They
imply, that the love of God rests on Christ in such a manner, as to
diffuse itself from him to us all; and not to us only, but even to the
angels themselves. Not that they need reconciliation, for they never
were at enmity with God: but even they become perfectly united to God,
only by means of their *Head,* (<span id="ix.xxx-p42.1"></span>[Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022)<span id="ix.xxx-p42.1"></span>..md)
For the same reason, he is also called “the first-born of every
creature,” (<span id="ix.xxx-p42.2"></span>[Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005)<span id="ix.xxx-p42.2"></span>;.md)
and Paul likewise states that Christ came

<span id="ix.xxx-p43"></span>“to reconcile all things to himself, both
those which are on earth, and those which are in heavens,” (<span
id="ix.xxx-p43.1"></span>[Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)<span id="ix.xxx-p43.1"></span>..md)
